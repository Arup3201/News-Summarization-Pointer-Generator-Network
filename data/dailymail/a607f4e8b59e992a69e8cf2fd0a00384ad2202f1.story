He made the world hold its breath as he spun a tall tale of abandonment and loss.

But when his lies unravelled 'Forest Boy' disappeared without a trace - until he was spotted tossing burgers at a fast food joint in Berlin.

This photo of the Forest Boy in the urban jungle hit the website of the Germany's biggest selling newspaper last night.

Finally found: Missing 'Forest Boy' Robin Van Helsum, 20, has been spotted working in a Burger King fast food restaurant in Berlin

Bild printed a photo of who they said is Robin van Helsum, 20, flipping meat patties at a Burger King franchise in Berlin.

It comes as authorities pursue him for the lies he told about being orphaned and living in a forest.

Vanishing act: The 'Forest Boy' has been missing for three months but is thought to remain in Germany

They want to charge him close to 
£25,000 for the cost of keeping him in a children's home after he 
wandered into a Berlin town hall last year spinning a tale taller than 
the Empire State Building in New York.

He had wandered into a town hall in Berlin last September, speaking broken English and claiming he was called Ray.

He
said he had been living in a forest with his father called Ryan for 
five years but had buried him after his sudden death two weeks 
previously.

Berlin social 
services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for the 
English-speaking Dutchman.

They also gave him a staggering £200 a month 
in pocket money.

But in 
reality he was a disaffected Dutch boy with a complicated home life and 
an illegitimate child who simply wanted to disappear off the radar and 
start a new life.

Van Eslum had vanished from his hometown of Hengelo only days before his arrival in Berlin.

After
ten months of living on taxpayer's money he was exposed after police 
released a photo of him in June and his step-mother came forward.

He
then disappeared again for three months and last week, neither his 
stepmother, his ex-girlfriend from the town of Hengelo, German or Dutch 
police said they knew where he was.

His
stepmother Ellen told a Dutch newspaper last week: 'A day after his 
unmasking he phoned me and asked if he could come home because he needed
to rest.

'Of course I said yes, you're welcome.

'He responded with the words: "I'll call you tomorrow or the day after."

'But I have heard nothing more.

'I was assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside, but nothing.'

His stepmother added: 'I think he is 
still in Germany but I don't know for sure.

'There were rumours he was 
sighted in Hengelo, but Robin is smart enough to know that he would have
problems if that was the case.'

Friends said Van Helsum left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'.

Berlin's youth authorities did believe he might have taken up with a community of
itinerant fruit pickers moving from village to village throughout the 
summer.

Expensive: 'Ray' was looked after for ten months after he walked into the city claiming to have lost his memory

Possessions: Van Helsum said his mother had died when he was 12 and cut contact with family and friends

Schoolmates in Hengelo, however, spotted him on the news when the pictures were published around the world. His step-mother identified him and asked him to come back home

But last night he was on the website of Europe's biggest paper serving up 
burgers for one of the world's biggest fast food chains.

A spokesman for Berlin's youth authorities said: 'It pleases us that he is working and will soon be able to pay us back.'

Berlin prosecution authorities were not available to say if he has contacted them to start paying back the money for his care.

Left without a word: The house of the father of the 'forest boy Ray' in Hengelo, the Netherlands

ROC Twente, the school where 'forest boy Ray' studied in Hengelo: Friends there told Dutch media that he had personal problems and his disappearance and reappearance was 'his way of starting a new life

Accommodation: The tent which Ray was apparently using when he was in the woods
