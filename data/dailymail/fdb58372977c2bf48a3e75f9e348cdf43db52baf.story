She set the internet on fire last year by claiming to have an extra asset.

But 21-year-old 'Jasmine Tridevil' became the subject of intense scrutiny after extraordinary images suggested she had become the first woman in the world to have an artificial third breast fitted.

Then last week the wannabe pop star - real name Alisha Hessler - from Tampa, Florida broke her silence to insist she's not a hoaxer, defiantly claiming: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.'

But Daily Mail Online has now obtained secretly filmed images that prove once and for all that Hessler is lying.

These photos – taken by a specialist thermal imaging camera - show her third breast is indeed a fake.

Scrutinized: Many commentators have claimed the third breast is a wearable prosthetic, especially as Tridevil once reported a '3 breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014

Proof at last: Body heat pictures through a simple thermal imaging camera. Red indicates normal body temperature due to blood flow. Blue means no blood flow - and there is none at the 'third breast'

Uncovered: German television journalist Hans Huebner (right) took the footage showing how the third breast could not actually be a real one 

A surgically implanted third breast – which she claims to have forked out $20,000 for - would have blood circulating around it.

But as these video stills show the breast in the middle is blue, a sign that there's no heat in this area, while the rest of her body is warm red.

The images were shot by German TV network RTL during an interview in October last year.

RTL's Miami based producer and investigative reporter Hans Huebner told Daily Mail Online that Hessler's fake breast is simply a hoax designed to boost her chances of becoming a reality TV star.

'These images are absolute proof that Jasmine Tridevil is a liar, we exposed her as a fake,' he said.

'We scheduled an interview with Jasmine in October last year but we were obviously skeptical as to whether her claims were genuine.

'Every plastic surgeon in the world was saying that they wouldn't do this type of surgery.

'So we discussed how we would shoot the interview and we came up with the idea of renting a thermal camera.

'My cameraman went to Home Depot and rented a Thermal Imaging Camera for $100.

'He filmed the interview as normal but secretly used the thermal camera as well.'

During the interview Huebner said he pressed Hessler on the truth to her claims.

Questionable: Jasmine Tridevil claimed: 'I know my breasts are real and I do not care what anybody thinks.'

'She insisted it was genuine but by the end she cut the interview short, she didn't like my questions and got angry,' said Huebner.

'She said, 'this interview is over' and walked out.'

Huebner said that after the interview aired on RTL – Europe's largest domestic television network - he received a 'nasty' email from Hessler.

'She sent me this nasty email saying it was us who were faking it,' he said.

After Hessler's story broke last year many commentators claimed the third breast was a wearable prosthetic - especially as she reported a 'three breast prosthesis' stolen when her bags went missing at Tampa Airport in 2014.

But Hessler continued to stand firm claiming it was a real implant.

In an interview last week she said: 'Getting a third breast was not always my plan - I just had the idea two years ago.

'People always have something to say. They will criticize it or will love it and ask for a picture.'

Hessler admits not all the attention she gets is complimentary, adding: 'If I go to a park where there are children, parents will give me dirty looks.

'But if I go to a bar it seems like everybody loves it.'

Hessler insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

Now, she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, Florida, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman.

While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'.

The ethical code outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.'

Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body.
