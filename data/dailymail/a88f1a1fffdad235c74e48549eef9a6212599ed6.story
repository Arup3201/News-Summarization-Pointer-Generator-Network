Adventurer Greg Healey has finally arrived home to Swansea - after completing an epic 20,000 mile cycle ride, across 20 countries.

The former account, 32, battled monsoons, searing heat, paralysing headwinds, accidents and terrifying traffic on lawless highways during his staggering trip around the globe.

With little more than his bike, a tent 
and a camera, intrepid Mr Healey cycled through Europe, North and South 
America, the Far East and India before heading home through Turkey and the 
Balkans and back into Europe.

And the intrepid Mr Healey celebrated the end his amazing journey with a home-cooked fish and chip dinner with family last night.

He told MailOnline: 'India was really tough for me. One the one hand it was a really incredible experience. The poeple are so gracious and they will help you in every possible way.

'But on the other hand, you go to the most remote villages, where they've never seen a white guy before. I found myself standing in the middle of this street, mobbed by 200 people, who are just pointing and staring at you.

'One night I found what I thought was the most perfect place, grassy lawn overlooking a lake. I put my tent down, it was in the middle of monsoon season and the storm erupted over my head.

'It was at that moment the waters started to rise and I started to smell an unpleasant odour. The next morning I realised I'd pitched my tent in the middle of the village latrine.'

He added: 'For me the challenge is 
very marginally physical. I think most people, with a little training 
could do it. The real hardship is the mental side, the monotony, the 
loneliness.

'But I think one of the key things I'd love people to take from this is if he can do it so can I.'

Mr Healey, from Swansea - who is no stranger to extraordinary adventures having previously summited Mount Everest - said there were only a few times he feared for his life.

But during one leg of his journey across Chile, he felt at his most vulnerable as he endured countless close-calls while cycling along a treacherous highway. 

He said: 'There was no guardrail, it was single lane with juggernauts thundering along. It was frightening. It wasn't just the vehicles behind that you had to worry about, it was the cars and lorries overtaking and heading straight at you which you also had to watch out for.'

The terrifying Route 7 lasted 700 kilometers and took Mr Healey several days to negotiate - mirracously without major incident. 

He added: 'There was no other way across Chile. I had to take that road. I even thought about doing it at night when there was less traffic. But looking back, that would have been suicidal.'

He kept his friends, family and
well-wishers upto date with his amazing adventures via his Facebook 
page Around the world in 9,722,159 pedals.

On
his last Facebook update, Mr Healey said: 'Perfect weather on the home 
run into Swansea yesterday and this adventure comes to an end. It has 
been such an incredible journey and the support I have had has boosted 
me in the lows and motivated me during the highs. Thank you everyone, I 
am honoured that you all came along for the ride :)'

He wrote: 'Final few days on the approach to Mumbai. Some of the most difficult headwinds I have faced and long 100 miles days.'

Another entry adds: 'The monsoon hits! With rising water levels it quickly got to the point where it was only me sitting in the tent that was stopping it being washed away, a VERY wet night.'

friends he met during the 4,500 journey helped him overcome the 
crippling conditions.

'My
amazing adventure across America has almost come to an end. 120 degree 
heat, suffocating humidity, tornadoes, torrential rain, paralysing 
headwinds, vast deserts, breathtaking canyons but most importantly 
countless new friends.

'Fourteen punctures, two new chains, a new rear wheel and cassette, an upgraded saddle and the most awesome tiger tan lines from my sandals and riding gloves.

'Next stop Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and the start of my Asian tour.'

Epic: Greg Healey had the jaw-dropping landscape of wild North America for company on his trip

Mr Healey told South Wales Evening Post as he faced the last few miles of his epic journey: 'It has been an emotional rollercoaster, day in and day out. I've met the most amazing people and been witness to the most amazing stories.

'Every single day has been a huge adventure. More than the physical exhaustion of it has been the emotional exhaustion of every day finding somewhere to sleep and something to eat – the slow accumulation of daily survival.

'But to be honest, it is a great way to see the world.'
