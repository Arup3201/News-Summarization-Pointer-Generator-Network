After years of castigating Barack Obama for his economic stewardship and his health insurance overhaul, real estate billionaire Donald Trump has cut the president some slack.

Seated behind a cluttered desk in his Trump Tower building in New York City, Trump said he could think of one Obama administration accomplishment that he found praiseworthy.

'You could say the only thing would be the execution of the man who knocked down the World Trade Center,' Trump told MailOnline Tuesday, referring to the Navy SEAL raid that took out terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.

Then, with an abrupt head-turn, Trump took a deep breath.

Donald Trump praised Obama for the bin Laden kill raid -- for a moment -- before shifting all the credit to the U.S. military

Obama bin Laden led al-Qaeda through the 9/11 attacks in 2001, but then went into hiding, spurring a years-long intelligence chase that culminated in Barack Obama's 'go' order nearly a decade later

Spectator: President Obama 'happened to be there, and he said, "Yes, go get him",' Trump insisted

'But in all fairness, that was the military that was after him for years,' he said.Â 

'The guys that got him did a great job. 
When the Navy SEALs went in, they did fantastic work. Obama happened to 
be there, and he said, "Yes, go get him."'

The American intelligence operations that ultimately located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan began in earnest in 2002, during the first George W. Bush administration, when CIA interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility learned a code name used by the terrorist's most trusted courier.

Through nine years of work, most of them during the Bush years, the CIA and military intelligence assets worked out the courier's real name and picked up his trail.

The location of the al-Qaeda leader's Pakistan hideout was first confirmed just one year after Obama took office.

From there an intelligence operation taking more than a year and costing tens of millions of dollars zeroed in on bin Laden, with a CIA official and the admiral in charge of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) making a presentation to the president in January 2011.

Obama, it turns out, learned of bin Laden's whereabouts after the tactical options were already worked out.

Obama spent part of his 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner speech playfully mocking Trump over the business magnate's involvement in a media scrum over his birth certificate

Trump told MailOnline that he enjoyed the ribbing, which included this White House mockup as Obama imagined it in a Trump administration

Trump, who has rhetorically body-slammed the president at nearly every opportunity, had kind words to say about a comedy routine the president recited at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner.

'I thought it was funny,' he told MailOnline. 'I really had a good time.'

'Obama was telling jokes about me. It was just fun. And I said to my wife, "This is amazing. Here's the president of the United States, he's up in front of 6,000 people, and all he's talking about is me. I love it." I had a great time.'

On the night of that speech, history now shows, Obama was waiting for word from the CIA and JSOC about whether the bin Laden raid was underway.

Trump, though, was dismissive about the president's part in it all.

'Obama made the decision, but who wouldn't have made that decision?' he asked.

'Would somebody actually have said, "Don't go after him"?'

Trump sat down with MailOnline and cited the Osama bin Laden 'kill raid' as an example of something Barack Obama did well

@highlight

But the pronouncement was a backhanded compliment

'When the Navy SEALs went in, they did fantastic work,' Trump said. 'Obama happened to be there'

On the night when Navy SEALs were en route to Abbottabad, Pakistan to 'kill or capture' bin Laden, Obama was mocking Trump in a comic speech

Trump recalled the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner, which included joke after joke at his expense, calling it 'fun' and 'amazing'
