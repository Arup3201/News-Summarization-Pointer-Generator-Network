Fans have criticised Manchester United heroes Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs for 'scandalous' prices at their new hotel on the doorstep of Old Trafford stadium.

Supporters wanting to stay at the four-star Hotel Football on March 14 - the day the club plays Tottenham Hotspur - can expect to pay £250 for a room plus £10 per person for breakfast.

But Neville has hit back at his critics, promising that pints will cost just £3.50.

The £250 price tag is for a standard room which has a king size bed or two single beds, 40" Samsung smart TV with full Sky Sports package, as well as complimentary wifi and water.

Prices are considerably less on non-match days.

Speaking out on Twitter, @BleaseyMCred said: 'Bleeding hell @GNev2. Rooms from £150 pn and £4.90 per pint. I thought this hotel was for the fans.'

To which Neville replied: 'Your looking at London prices mate. Pint 3.50 like Trafford arms and others!' 

In his tweet, Neville was explaining the fan was looking at beer prices for Football Cafe in London, which he also launched with Giggs.

Another twitter user, @joeboff tweeted: 'So, everyone seems to agree that should have built a hotel for local people. Hmm.' 

Hotel Football promises to provide football fans with 'the ultimate match day experience', including corporate hospitality experiences, football-themed café, and the Old Trafford Supporters Club housed inside.

There is also a rooftop pitch with views over Manchester.

The hotel restaurant Café Football will serve traditional match day favourites like sausage rolls and burgers with a twist, as part of a menu designed by two Michelin star chef, Michael Wignall.  

Other Class of '92 alumni are involved in the project, including Philip Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. 

Neville previously said: 'To make sure that the hotel appeals to everyone, not just football fans, we are working with some of the most talented people in the industry to create something unique and inviting – with a focus on excellent customer service.'

The hotel is set to open in March.
