The Obamacare website went down on Sunday night after a connectivity issue at its data center - in the latest problem to hit the health insurance program's troubled rollout.

The data center, operated by Verizon's Terremark, experienced the connectivity issue during planned maintenance - halting online enrollment at Healthcare.gov for uninsured Americans across 50 states.

It came just hours after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius praised the data services hub, writing online: 'The Hub is on the job, and so are we.'

The data center issue also affected similar sites operated by 14 states and the District of Columbia, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Latest issue: A connectivity problem at the data center responsible for running Healthcare.gov - the beleaguered website for Obamacare - forced it to crash across all 50 states on Sunday

Separate technical problems that have 
stalled enrollment on Healthcare.gov since its launch on October 1 are 
at the heart of a new Republican effort to discredit the healthcare law,
largely through congressional investigations to determine what went 
wrong in building the costly sign-up system.

Sebelius is due to testify later this week before a House of Representatives committee, while contractors work around the clock to improve the site.

The outage that started in the early hours of Sunday caused the data center to lose network connectivity with the federal government's data services hub, an electronic traffic roundabout that links the online health insurance marketplaces with numerous federal agencies and can verify people's identity, citizenship, and other facts.

Without the hub, consumers are unable to apply online for coverage or determine their eligibility for federal subsidies to help pay for insurance premiums.

On Saturday, Sebelius praised the hub's 
ability to perform complex calculations in quick time as an example of a
successful segment of the system.

HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Sebelius spoke with Verizon's chief executive officer on Sunday afternoon to discuss the situation: 'They committed to fixing the problem as soon as possible.'

The outage was affecting enrollment in all 50 states, as well as Terremark customers not connected with the marketplaces, according to the HHS spokeswoman. She said the data center's network connectivity went down during planned maintenance to replace a failed networking component.

A spokesman for Verizon said the problem would be fixed 'as soon as possible'.

'Our engineers have been working with HHS and other technology companies to identify and address the root cause of the issue,' Verizon spokesman Jeff Nelson said.

The administration has expressed confidence it can fix underlying problems with Healthcare.gov by early December, in time for people to meet a December 15 deadline to enroll in new health plans to receive benefits on January 1.

Struggle: As Obama encourages people to sign up for the healthcare, Congressional Republicans are waging war against the hapless site and hoping it leads to the destruction of the system

Further delays would jeopardize its ability to enroll as many as 7 million Americans for coverage during Obamacare's first year.

Sebelius, who faces Republican calls for her resignation, will be grilled about her role in the Obamacare rollout on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Contractors have already blamed the administration for not conducting enough vital system-wide testing and for a last-minute design change requiring online visitors to set up accounts before window-shopping for insurance.

The change is widely blamed for creating early bottlenecks as millions of people flooded the website.

Health officials in Connecticut, one of the 14 states that constructed their own marketplaces, were the first to report on Sunday that potential customers would not be able to complete the sign-up process for some services but could create accounts and search for pricing comparisons.
