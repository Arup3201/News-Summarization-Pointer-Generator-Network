London Underground services were expected to return to normal this morning after huge delays and disruption caused by a 48-hour strike over ticket office closures.

Fresh talks will be held today to try to resolve the bitter dispute which sparked the strike.

The walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA unions officially ended at 9pm last night, but a further 48-hour stoppage is planned from next Tuesday evening if there is no deal at the talks.

Some commuters claimed at around 11pm last night that some stations on the network were still closed - two hours after the strike officially ended.

However, Transport for London had earlier warned that services would still be disrupted after 9pm yesterday, and had urged people not to 'leave it too late to travel'.

Union officials will meet London Underground (LU) under the chairmanship of the conciliation service Acas after several days of previous talks failed to end the dispute.

LU said more trains ran to more destinations and more stations yesterday than on Wednesday, but passengers still faced disruption to Tube services, and long queues at bus stations and on roads.

Journeys on the capital's Barclays bicycle hire scheme were up by 50 per cent for the second day, although wet and windy weather persuaded many people to work from home.

LU managing director Mike Brown, who had urged the unions to bring forward the meeting, said he was grateful for the ‘patience’ shown by passengers.

The unions have been urging London mayor Boris Johnson to meet them to discuss the closures, which will see the loss of 950 jobs.

Val Shawcross, Labour's transport spokeswoman on the London Assembly, has written to the mayor urging him to launch a full public consultation on the plans to cut jobs and close all ticket offices.

‘The mayor and TfL must hold a public consultation on the plans to cut station staff and close all Tube ticket offices.

Londoner Tom Dixon, who lives near Hyde Park Corner Underground station, called MailOnline to lament that he was expecting his local station to be open last night - but it was still shut at 11pm.

He said that he also walked to Knightsbridge at about the same time - and that was also closed, adding: ‘The whole thing is that they're not going to start operating trains until this morning.

‘When the strike is officially over and things are back to normal, everyone expects that things will have been running for the last few hours of the (previous) day. This is the ordinary public screwed.’

And journalist Alex Clark sent a tweet to Transport for London at 11.52pm saying: 'Can you say why we were told Tube would reopen at 9pm Thurs? Many stations still closed. Better for passengers to be clear.'

Her sentiments were echoed by Twitter user Patrick 'sunpat', who asked TfL in a message at 10.51pm: 'Why when the strike finished at 9pm are there still Tube stations closed?'

A TfL spokesman had said on Twitter last night just before 8pm: 'Strike is scheduled to end around 9pm but services will still be disrupted. Please don't leave it too late to travel.'

‘There are some interesting ideas in 
TfL's plans and modernisation is needed, but Londoners should be given 
the chance to have their say and improve them.

‘No one has a monopoly on good ideas and Boris should be willing to listen to what the public have to say.

‘The unions have raised legitimate concerns over passenger safety and how more vulnerable Tube users will be affected by the changes.’

The mayor has refused to meet the unions unless they call off the industrial action. RMT leader Bob Crow said: ‘Our negotiators are geared up and ready to enter the exploratory talks.’

TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said it was time for the mayor to ‘get serious’, claiming that 70 per cent of the network was at a standstill yesterday.

‘We want no more stunts or PR baloney from Boris. No more talk of a secret army of volunteers marching to London's rescue.

‘We want serious and detailed talks on our genuine fears for the safety and security of passengers and staff under these far-reaching plans.

‘If that happens, I believe we can reach a settlement that will avoid next week's 48-hour walkout.’

TfL said almost three out of four Tube stations were open yesterday, with services running on nine out of 11 lines, although trains were not stopping at some stations.

There were no services on the Circle or Waterloo & City lines, and nothing through the central area of the Piccadilly line.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I understand how frustrating this has been for many Londoners and I'd like to thank them for their patience and stoicism during this completely unnecessary strike.

Thousands of Metropolitan Police civilian staff plan to strike for two days next week, coinciding with the next Tube walkout, in a separate row over pay.

Members of the Public and Commercial Services union will stop work on Wednesday and Thursday in protest at the imposition of a 1 per cent wage rise.

General secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It ought to bring shame on the Met Police that staff who help to keep London safe are being driven into the arms of loan sharks because of low pay.

'The Met Police is not short of money and does not have to ape the Government's politically motivated pay policies that have fuelled the longest decline in wages on record.'

‘I am grateful to the London Underground 
staff who rejected this pointless action and worked, and to the hundreds
 of volunteers who are helping passengers through the day.

‘I'm
 pleased that having failed repeatedly to engage in constructive talks 
around TfL's modernisation plans, the unions have agreed to sit down 
with TfL at Acas.

‘Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses, they should have been talking to TfL this week. That the unions won't negotiate until after the strike is over tomorrow says a lot about their failure to engage.

‘If, as they claimed yesterday, Mr Crow and Mr Cortes are happy to embrace modernisation, new technology and change, then what on earth are they doing on strike when these changes do just that and involve no compulsory redundancies?’
