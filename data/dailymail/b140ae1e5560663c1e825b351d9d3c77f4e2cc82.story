A Michigan meat packing company is recalling a reported 1.8million pounds of ground beef products after 11 E.coli cases, federal officials said Monday.

Ground beef products produced by Wolverine Packing Company between March 31 and April 18 were recalled, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) said in a press release.Â

So far, there have been 11 reported cases of E.coli O157:H7 across four states, with onset dates between April 22 and May 2, officials said.

E.coli O157:H7 can be lethal and cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramping, federal officials said. It also can cause kidney failure for children under 5 and older adults.

The ground beef products had been shipped to Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio distributors for restaurant use, FSIS said. They were not sent to the Department of Defense, the National School Lunch Program or put up online.

FSIS said it was notified of the E.coli O157:H7 cases last Monday. Working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FSIS linked the Wolverine ground beef products to the E.coli cases.

Meat products should be cooked at 160 degrees Fahrenheit, FSIS warns. The agency has published a list of recalled products, all of which show the number 'EST. 2574B' on packaging.
