The owners of a racetrack where a teenager was strangled when her scarf caught in her go-kart admitted breaching health and safety rules yesterday.

Suzanne Cornwell, 18, lost her life when her green scarf caught in the rear axle of her kart in an out-of-hours session with five friends and track staff.

It was the first time she had been karting but no safety rules were explained to her as she got into the kart without a protective overall and her scarf blowing loose.

The owners of Peterborough Raceway Ltd, in Caxton, Cambridgeshire, have now admitted breaching health and safety legislation at Peterborough Crown Court.

Manager of the track at the time, Paul Shinn, also pleaded guilty to breaching regulations over the tragedy in December 2009.

Peterborough Raceway Ltd and Mr Shinn will be sentenced on November 4.

Cllr Mick Martin of South Cambridgeshire District Council who prosecuted the case said: 'This was a tragic accident.

'First and foremost our thoughts have been with the family throughout this difficult time and I hope the conclusion of this process will help them in some way.

'There were very clear shortcomings from the company in their practices.

'We hope our action sends a clear message to other companies that they need to take their responsibilities very seriously.'

An inquest into her death in February last year in 
Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Suzanne was one of six friends 
invited to the track by an employee.

Suzanne was studying at Long Road Sixth 
Form College in Cambridge and lived with her father David, mother Wendy 
and older brother Stuart.

Suzanne,
from Hardwick, near Cambridge, was rushed to hospital after her scarf 
got caught in the rear axle of her go-kart on December 11, 2009.

A post mortem carried out by Home Office 
Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift recorded the medical cause of death as 
ligature strangulation.

The track has since reopened under new management.
