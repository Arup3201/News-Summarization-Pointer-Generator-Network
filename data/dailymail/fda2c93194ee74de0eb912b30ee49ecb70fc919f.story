Hillary Clinton suggested Tuesday that President Barack
Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of
Iraq at the end of 2011, a decision that created a power vacuum now filled by a
vicious Islamist terror group.

'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,'
she said during a town hall on CNN.

Clinton was referring to the two governments' failure to
sign a mutual Status of Forces Agreement, a document that would have kept
American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a
U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops
who broke local laws.

Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S.

ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011

Iraq has descended into chaos in recent weeks, with an al-Qaeda-related Islamist terror group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seizing cities and presiding over mass executions of Iraqi soldiers.

The group, formerly called Al-Qaeda in Iraq, aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' – a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries – held together by strict Shariah law.

The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes.

The White House said Monday that Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting.

On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city.

Much of their advance has come with the help of American arms, tanks, rockets and other war materiel, seized as Iraqi army regulars and reserves fled.

Clinton left the Obama administration in early 2013, but
spoke like a policymaker who is still in charge of American foreign policy during Tuesday's live event.

The maybe-presidential-candidate assured her audience of
nearly 200 hand-picked people at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. that 'we are
certainly not putting American soldiers at risk. No boots on the ground.'

Clinton entered the stage for the event, moderated by CNN's
Christiane Amanpour, to wild applause, hoots and hollers and an extended
ovation.

She quickly acknowledged the carnival-like atomsphere of
her cable-TV coming out event, boasting that her friends in the Middle East
were having a 'watch party.'

Commenting on Monday's capture of Abu Khattalah, an accused
ringleader of the September 11, 2012 attack on America's diplomatic station in
Benghazi, Libya, she said she was 'very pleased.'

'This is another indication ... that the United States has
an unwavering commitment to bring to justice those who are responsible for
attacks on Americans,' Clinton said.

And commenting on the nearly two years that have passed, in
which Khattalah openly operated in Libya and gave media interviews while
wipping strawberry frappes in cafes, she insisted that no one in the federal
government slow-walked the Benghazi investigation.

'It took more than ten years to being Osama Bin Laden to
Justice,' Clinton said.

Clinton gave prominent mention to a State Department
Accountability Review Board report which seemed to clear her of wrongdoing
related to the Benghazi facilities' lack of security on the eleventh
anniversary of the first 9/11 terror attacks.

That investigation, however, has come under fire for failing
to interview Clinton.

She said she feels the pain of the mothers and family
members of the four Americans who died in the Benghazi conflagration, caused by
the Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah.

'I can see why she and others are inconsolable,' Clinton
said. 

But 'we need to be in dangerous places ... We're doing the
best we can to find out what happened.'

'There's a lot we don’t know,' she said. 

'Now that we have Khattalah in custody, hopefully we will
learn more from his perspective.'

The U.S. government, she assured viewers, wants to know
'what the motivations of the leaders, of the attackers, happened to be.'

Clinton has been widely criticized for claiming in the early
days after the attack that a spontaneous mob angered by an anti-Islam video
attacked the Benghazi compound, and not a premeditated terrorist group.

No one asked her about that awkward chapter.
