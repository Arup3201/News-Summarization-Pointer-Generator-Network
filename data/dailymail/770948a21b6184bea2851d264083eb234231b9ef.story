A self-styled 'pick-up coach' accused of encouraging violence against women has been  banned from Britain today.

Julien Blanc runs a company that claims to teach men to seduce women and make them 'beg' for sex but will no longer be able to fly in to the UK for a 'bootcamp'  next week.

Critics say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling. 

He was due to run a seminar in Britain next week but more than 136,000 people signed a petition for him to be refused a visa and Home Office ministers have intervened.

Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone said: 'Julien Blanc's presence in the UK could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment. I am delighted that Mr Blanc won't be coming to our shores.'

Blanc has successfully been running £1,200-a-head seminars across the globe despite his own admission he is the 'most hated man in the world'.

Now Theresa May has reportedly intervened although the Home Office refused to comment.

A source told Sky News that the Government is 'likely' to reject any visa application he makes. 

Caroline Charles, who is using a pseudonym, started the petition on Change.org. She said: 'I'm very pleased that we have achieved the outcome we wanted. I've said all along this isn't about me – the voices of the 158,000 people who signed have been heard.

'That the petition garnered so much attention in such a short period of time only highlights the everyday, ongoing relevance of sexism and misogyny. 

'We cannot continue to ignore what is a daily reality for all women – particularly felt by transwomen and women of colour – by shielding men like Blanc behind the veneer of 'free speech.'

'Pick up coach' Julien Blanc joins a short list of people banned from the UK in recent years.

2014: French celebrity Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, right, was banned this year. The 'comedian', with convictions for inciting racial hatred, was at the centre of a Premier League anti-Semitism row. He said he would come to London to support then West Bromwich Albion striker Nicolas Anelka, who did a 'quenelle' salute. But the Home Office decided he was not allowed into the country, adding him to Britain's banned list.

2013: Conservative American bloggers Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer were banned. They are the founders of the anti-Muslim group Stop Islamization of America and they run the website Jihad Watch. Both were planning on speaking at an English Defence League march  in Woolwich, where Lee Rigby was murdered, but were stopped by the UK Border Agency . 

2009: Far-right Dutch MP Geert WIlders was turned back at Heathrow as he tried to defy a ban on entering Britain. He was barred from the UK because he was likely to incite hatred and his visit a threat to 'community harmony and therefore public security'.  He was seized by border guards after his aircraft touched down, and questioned for more than an hour before flying back to the Netherlands. 

Last week a minister in her department, Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone, said that she was lobbying Mrs May to ban him, adding that she was 'extremely concerned by [his] sexist and utterly abhorrent statements'.

Footage has emerged of Mr Blanc, 25, using racist language and grabbing women by the throat. One Twitter post says: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie [spike] your own drink? #JustKidding.'

His website says men can 'shortcircuit' a woman's 'logical mind' to get her into bed. A YouTube video shows him on the streets of Tokyo grabbing women and pushing their heads into his groin.

He also reposted a chart used by support groups to identify signs of domestic abuse with the words: 'May as well be a checklist. #HowToMakeHerStay.'

On his website he says people taught by him can 'make girls BEG to sleep with you after short-circuiting their emotional and logical mind into a million reasons why they should'.

US-based Mr Blanc had to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled, and a similar campaign has been mounted to bar him from Canada. The woman behind the UK petition, using the pseudonym Caroline Charles, said: 'To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.' 

Mr Blanc, who charges £1,200 for a three-day course, was due to host events in Britain on November 27 and December 19, with 11 more next year. 

He has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'.

It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'.

But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them.

A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.'

RSD's website had been advertising a 'bootcamp' to teach the firm's techniques in London starting on November 27. Concern over Mr Blanc's ability to attend has already seen some customers inquire about a refund.

A social media campaign in Australia saw him forced to cut short his visit there earlier this month.

A Home Office spokesman said the department would not comment on individual cases, but added: 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good or if their exclusion is justified on public policy grounds.

'It is longstanding practice that we do not comment on individual exclusion cases unless they are made public by the excluded individual.

'This Home Secretary has excluded more foreign nationals on the grounds of unacceptable behaviour than any before her.'

His team did not respond to requests for comment.

Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, has apparently intervened in the case
