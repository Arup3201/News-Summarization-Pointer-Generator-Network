It turns out spiders are just as scared of us as we are of them.

This video shows a small spider which has built a web in a sink recoiling or twitching every time a man makes a loud noise to frighten it.

The startled spider curls up in a ball and spasms while the man apparently does his best impression of a shrieking Homer Simpson.

It was all to the delight of the man’s son, who giggles as his father torments the arachnid.

Even though it is frightened the spider doesn’t bother to flee its web.

Some YouTube viewers weren’t amused, with one commenting: ‘Animal abuse, just leave it alone. ’.

Another user wrote: ‘That must've been the most terrifying moment of that spider's life. ’

In 2011 a study found that spiders are extremely sensitive to vibrations.

The research determined that spiders are the second most vibration-sensitive organism, topped only by cockroaches, PhysOrg.com reported.

According to the study, led by Clemens F Schaber of the University of Vienna’s department of neurobiology, spiders have more than 3,000 sensors in their body.

Most are found on the legs and in vibration receptors near the leg joints.
