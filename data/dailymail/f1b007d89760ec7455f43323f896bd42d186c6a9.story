Fearsome: The type of automatic rifle used by the gunman to carry out the killings in the Jewish Museum

One man has been arrested, and remains in custody, but he is not thought to have a direct link with the actual killings. Authorities strongly suspect Al Qaeda-linked Islamic radicals are behing the attack.

Two men were seen pulling up outside the museum in an Audi car just before 4pm yesterday evening, before one took out a weapon from black bag.

Today, police issued a CCTV grab of one of the suspects entering the museum. He is weaing a blue shirt and dark trousers, and carrying two shoulder bags. Crucially, his face is obscured by a baseball cap.

Police also issued a photograph of the kinds of weapons used in the attack. MailOnline has not yet managed to identify the weapons in the photograph.

Once the killer entered the museum, he immediately targeted staff and visitors, firing bullets into their faces and necks. None of the victims have yet been named.

The two suspects are still on the run.

An official working for the Israeli 
Foreign Ministry today said: ‘A couple in their fifties from Tel Aviv 
were among the victims.

'We trust that the Belgian 
authorities, including the judicial authorities and the police, will be 
able to shed light on this terrible crime.’

Foreign Minister Didier Reynders who was in the vicinity said the scene 'was terrible and left me shocked'

A police spokesman said: ‘Bodies were 
left lying on the ground inside and outside the building. There was  
blood everywhere and people were screaming.’

The victims were reported to be two women and one man. Another man is seriously wounded.

A suspect was arrested and was being questioned last night by security officials.

The
 attacker was seen jumping into an Audi after the shootings by a witness
 who made a note of the number plate. The car was stopped by police 
shortly afterwards.

Belgian
 Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders, who was nearby at the time and 
heard the gunfire, was among the first to reach the scene.

He said he was ‘shocked’ by the killings, but added: ‘There were a lot of witnesses and the investigation is moving fast.’

Interior Minister Joelle Milquet branded the attack an 'act of anti-Semitism' as she addressed the media

Confirming
 that it was an ‘undoubted terrorist attack’, Brussels Mayor Yvan Mayeur
 said: ‘It’s not a coincidence the target was a Jewish museum.’

Eyewitness Alain Sobotik revealed he saw two bodies in the lobby of the museum.

‘One was a young woman with her head covered in blood. She was holding a leaflet and looked like a tourist,’ he added.

Around a dozen other visitors to the museum were caught up in the carnage, suffering minor injuries and severe shock.

Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo expressed his condolences and support for the victims' families.

Anti-Semitic attacks have become all too common in Europe over recent years, with Islamic radicals often behind them.

Maurice
 Sosnowski, President of the Coordination Centre of Jewish organisations
 in Belgium, said that this one, if confirmed, would be 'the worst 
anti-Jewish attack in Brussels since the Second World War.'

The Brussels museum highlights the suffering of Jews who were murdered, tortured and imprisoned during the Nazi Holocaust.

In
 2012 a French-Algerian anti-Semitic fanatic called Mohamed Merah gunned
 down seven people in and around the south western city of Toulouse 
before being killed in a shootout with police.

Among
 the victims of the 23-year-old Al-Qaeda supporter were three Jewish 
children and a rabbi who were murdered infront of their schools.

In
 the face of such savagery, security groups have launched numerous 
clamp-downs on extremists, including in cities like Belgium, which has a
 large Muslim population.
