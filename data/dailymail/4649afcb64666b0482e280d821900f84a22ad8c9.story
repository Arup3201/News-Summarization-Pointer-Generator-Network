A growing number of men are applying for positions as secretaries and personal assistants - a job predominantly taken by women in the past.

The surge is partly due to the high rate of graduate unemployment – more than one-fifth are out of work – and has been fuelled by salaries which can hit £75,000.

‘Out of the 1,000 candidates we’ve registered in the past 12 months, around 200 are male,’ said David Morel, of Tiger Recruitment. 'It's increasing the whole time.'

Increasing numbers of men are applying for positions as secretaries as salaries continue to rise. Posed by model

‘Since 2011 the numbers have been doubling each year, and most are ambitious graduates.

‘In the past, men felt the salaries weren’t high enough and there was a stigma attached to administrative, typing-based roles. The secretarial role has changed massively.

'Gone are the days of the traditional typist, and there is more of a career path.

‘Guys are seeing that they can get to a stage where they are providing a lot of business support to their boss, and that is reflected in their salary.’

Quest Professional, which offers training courses for the corporate 
sector, said this was the first year that men had enrolled on its 
executive PA programme and that 'more and more' men were doing its 
administrative course.

Susanna Tait, managing director of Tay Associates, said: 'We have 
witnessed the role of the PA evolve immeasurably and, with it, the pool 
of applicants it attracts.

'As well as organising and managing commitments, they are required to 
project-manage schedules and communicate with a vast network of 
contacts.

'It's an obvious career choice for ambitious individuals keen 
to operate at the centre of the business sphere.'

Joshua Watson, 25, an executive assistant to a female director at Barclays, said: ‘I don’t feel I’m treated any differently just because I’m male.

'I don’t think that is an issue for my generation. It’s a good job for me because I am passionate about organising.’

'I have good exposure to the top people in the company and I want to climb the ladder.'
