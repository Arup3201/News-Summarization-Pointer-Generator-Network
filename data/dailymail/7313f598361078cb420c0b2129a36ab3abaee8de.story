Pope Francis has warned Christians to avoid 'gossiping' as this is one of the temptations used by the devil to corrupt good people.

The Pontiff said life was a constant battle against evil because of the presence of the devil.

He admitted during Mass at his Santa Marta residence that even he 'has been tempted to gossip' about others.

During the homily, Pope Francis warned: 'We too are the target of attacks by the devil because the spirit of Evil does not want our holiness.'

He told worshipers: 'We have a temptation that grows: it grows and infects others. For example, let’s look at gossip: I’m a bit envious of this or that person and at first I’m just envious inside and I need to share it and go to another person and say: “But have you seen that person?".. and this gossip tries to grow and infects another and another… This is the way gossip works and all of us have been tempted to gossip.

'Maybe not one of you, if you’re a saint, but I too have been tempted to gossip! It’s a daily temptation. And it begins in this way, discreetly, like a trickle of water. It grows by infecting others and in the end it justifies itself.'

Pope Francis said that some people may consider him 'old fashioned' for talking about the devil in the 21st century.

He
 said: 'But look out because the devil is present! The devil is here… 
even in the 21st century! And we mustn’t be naïve, right? We must learn 
from the Gospel how to fight against Satan.'
