The elusive spring weather is still showing no signs of appearing in Britain, with the north of the country hit by torrential rain and flooding today.

Heavy downpours turned a busy dual carriageway in Newcastle into a virtual river this morning, while flooding in Durham - which has seen almost a month's worth of rainfall in the space of 24 hours - left motorists stranded on waterlogged rural roads.

Flood alerts are in place across the north east, and while forecasters are predicting drier days in the week ahead, Britons keeping their fingers crossed for warmer weather are likely to be disappointed.

Flooding: The less than spring-like weather in Newcastle saw a busy dual carriageway closed off to traffic today after heavy downpours

While temperatures could creep up as far as 19C in London tomorrow, the rest of the week will remain cool, the Met Office said.

The lowest temperature recorded overnight was in Exeter, where the mercury plunged to 1.7C.

The heavy rainfall sweeping the north of the country and Scotland today is expected to move off towards the west later on, turning to patchy showers by this evening, senior operational meteorologist Jenny Rourke said.

Nonetheless yellow rain warnings remain in place across the North East and North West of England and Yorkshire, along with swathes of Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Motorists were seen inching their cars through floodwater on Scotswood Road in Newcastle today, before the busy route was eventually closed to traffic as council workers worked to divert the water off the road.

In Durham a stranded driver had to be rescued after his car got stuck on a waterlogged rural road.

The relentless rain had rendered the country lane near Staindrop impassable.

The Met Office said around 1.8 inches of rain fell in Durham in the 24 hours to this afternoon, and police in the area were warning drivers to take extra care on the roads today.

Ms Rourke said the north of England was experiencing the worst of the dismal spring weather today.

She said the rest of the weekend was expected to be 'much drier', but warned that warmer temperatures on the horizon for the south of the country tomorrow would not last.

'The good news is that the weather for the south of the country is looking quite nice,' she said.

'The whole of the country will see a dry day with bright spells, with temperatures getting up to the high teens - 19C for London, 15C for Newcastle. It will be a bright day tomorrow for most places.

'But in the week ahead there's not going to be those sorts of high temperatures, they won't be hanging around for too long,' the meteorologist said.

'While we're not going to be seeing the sort of rain we had yesterday, there will be light and patchy rain in the early part of next week and showers in the middle of the week too.'

The outlook for the week may be less than promising given the time of year, but spring was definitely in evidence in at least one corner of London today as florists put the finishing touches to their colourful displays ahead of the Chelsea Flower Show next week.

A wall of cascading pink blooms was among the extravagant foliage photographed today ahead of the opening of the event on Tuesday.

The RHS Chelsea Flower Show will run from May 21 to 25 in the capital.

Forecasters at the Meteogroup warned people in central and eastern England to brace themselves for further showers on Monday, while the rest of the UK can expect to see cloudy skies with the best of the sunshine in the west.

There is also the risk of the odd sharp shower in the north and east, the group said.
