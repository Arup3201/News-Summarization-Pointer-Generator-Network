Forget pepper sprays and alarms, the latest line in defense against attackers is the iPhone case that doubles up as stun gun.

Called Yellow Jacket, the case comes with a 650K volt electrode that the firm claims is capable of 'halting an aggressive adult male.'

The case is fitted with a safety catch to make sure the electrode doesn't accidentally activate in a pocket, for example. The electrode is also protected by a cover.

The Yellow Jacket case, pictured, comes with a 650K volt electrode, inset, that its makers claim is capable of 'halting an aggressive adult male'. It was created by U.S. inventor Seth Froom after he was robbed at gunpoint in his home

In addition to being used as a weapon, Yellow Jacket has its own battery and can charge a phone for up to twenty hours.

The case can keep up to 10 per cent of this power in reserve to make sure that the stun gun can be used in emergencies, even if the phone's battery is dead.

The inventor of the product and founder of Yellow Jacket, Seth Froom, was robbed at gunpoint in his home in 2012.

Despite owning a firearm and a separate stun gun, Froom said the only object he had to hand during the robbery was his phone.

'That night changed my life', explained Froom. 'Why not take the most common device a person carries - their smartphone -  and combine it with a protective element?' 

'Every other phone case on the market 
provides protection for only the phone. Our phone case provides 
protection for both your phone and you.'

In addition to being used as a weapon, Yellow Jacket has its own battery and can charge a phone for up to twenty hours. The case can keep up to 10 per cent of this power in reserve, too, to make sure that the stun gun can be used in emergencies, even if the phone's battery is dead

The Yellow Jacket case is sold in the U.S., where it is legal in 42 of the 50 states. Stun guns can only be bought by over 18s without a felony record and must also only be bought for self defense.

Stun guns are illegal in the UK and considered to be firearms, which can carry up to a five-year jail sentence.

Yellow Jacket does not offer international shipping.

To discharge the stun gun, users need to pull the top corner of the case back and push the safety switch up.  To fire the gun, users must press and hold the blue button.

Once the electrode is no longer needed, users must pull down the safety button and 
replace the corner of the case so the device isn't accidentally activated 
in their pocket.

The original iPhone 4S case went on sale in the U.S. last year, and the firm recently unveiled a redesigned iPhone 5 and 5S model during the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.

Yellow Jacket is also working on a case for the Samsung Galaxy S4.

Prices start at $99 (£60) for the original model and $149 (£90) for the iPhone 5S version.

The Yellow Jacket case is sold in the U.S. where it is legal in 42 of the 50 states.

Stun guns can only be bought by over 18s without a felony record. Stun guns must also only be bought for self defense.

Stun guns are illegal in the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island where punishments vary from a fine to two years in jail.

In Connecticut  and North Carolina the stun gun is legal but only in the owner's property/home.

In Illinois, Michigan users must have a firearms license.

Stun guns are legal in Maryland, except Annapolis, Baltimore, and Howard County and in Pennsylvania, excluding Philadelphia.

In Wisconsin, owners must have a CCW (Concealed Carry) Permit.

Stun guns are illegal in the UK because they're considered a firearm and possession can lead to a five-year prison sentence.
