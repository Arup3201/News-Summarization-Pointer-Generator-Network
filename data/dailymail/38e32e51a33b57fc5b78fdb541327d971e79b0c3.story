They may not be regarded as the world’s greatest lovers,  but it seems you can rely on British men where it really counts.

That’s right – our chaps are far more likely to be found scrubbing sinks or dusting the dining room than any other men in Europe, a study has found.

There’s still some way to go before they catch up with women, who typically do a bigger share of household chores.

Rule Britannia: A study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores

But in Britain, men do a third of the work, while those in Spain and Italy only manage a fifth.

The study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores.

The Spanish team logged time spent cooking, ironing, cleaning the house, washing dishes, doing the laundry and odd jobs, gardening and shopping for groceries.

‘If all housework is considered, the United Kingdom would rate as the most egalitarian country,  followed by France, Germany, and as more inegalitarian cases, Italy and Spain,’ said lead author Marta Dominguez Folgueras, of Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona.

‘The difference is significant:  men in the United Kingdom do on average one third of the housework whereas in Italy, they hardly manage 20 per cent.’

Participants were asked to keep a diary of what they did during each 15-minute period of the day.

Still trying to impress? the study also found that cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts

The lion’s share of chores fell to women – except in shopping, where the work was evenly split, and some ‘occasional male tasks’.

Italian couples spent the most time on household chores – seven hours per day between them.

The British came in fourth, at five hours and 52 minutes, while the French spent the least time.

The study, published in the Journal of Family Issues, also looked at the difference between married couples and those who were cohabiting, but not married.

It found cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts.

The average married male did 23 per cent of the chores, but those who had yet to walk down the aisle did 30 per cent, a trend researchers suggest is partly down to a desire to impress a partner.

‘Cohabiting unions hold more egalitarian divisions of household labour, both in terms of quantity – percentage of household load – and quality – types of task performed,’ the researchers wrote. They said living together may be ‘part of a partner selection process’ in which willingness to do chores is seen as ‘a desirable trait’.

Living as an unmarried couple was most common in France, where 20 per cent chose to cohabit, followed by the UK with 14 per cent.

Young people were the most likely to live together when not married.

A separate study this week found women in the UK do more unpaid housework and childcare than those in most other countries.

The research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that in a week, married British women spend an average of 11 more hours on household matters than their husbands do, while putting in three hours less in paid work.
