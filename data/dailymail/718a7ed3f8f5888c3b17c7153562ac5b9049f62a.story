Andy Murray has taken to the courts of Abu Dhabi and Perth in the past few days in a stylish new range of sportswear from his latest kit sponsor Under Armour.

The former Wimbledon champion has signed a four-year contract - estimated to be worth £15m - with the lesser known American brand after his deal with adidas came to an end.

And it looks like the new clothing could breathe new life into the British number one's game as he emerged as the victor of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship.

Going global: The former Wimbledon champ is the first major British sports star to sign a contract with the brand who have risen in success in the U.S from humble origins

New fashion era: Murray receives his trophy wearing a trendy grey top from his latest kit sponsors after his contract with adidas came to an end

His winning streak continued today as he beat Frenchman Benoit Paire in the Hopman Cup mixed-team event in Perth, Australia. 

The victories comes after Murray, 27, had a lacklustre sporting year in 2014 as he failed to build on his grand slam success as Wimbledon champion in 2013 thanks to coming back from shoulder surgery.

Murray won his latest title after world number one Novak Djokovic withdrew through illness ahead of the final.

Put to the test: The Under Armour T-shirt is said to regulate body temperature and wick away sweat from the body... something Murray needed today as he played in 44 degree heat in Australia

While Murray did not have to play to win the exhibition match, he proved his form has improved by beating Rafael Nadal to reach the final, which should give him a confidence boost ahead of this month's Australian Open. 

Murray showed off garments from his new kit sponsor when he collected his trophy on court on Saturday.

He wore a flattering, grey zip-up long-sleeved top by the brand, which was founded in 1996 by former University of Maryland football player Kevin Plank.

Signing autographs: The tennis star was mobbed by fans as he landed in Perth, Australia, for his next tournament

The Scot was later pictured wearing the same top as he landed in Perth, Australia, for the Hopman Cup in which he will team up with fellow Brit Heather Watson to play in the mixed team tournament. 

Murray was accompanied by his mother, Judy, who is back on the tennis circuit following her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing. The 55-year-old has become accustomed to glamorous ballgowns and glitzy dresses during her time on the BBC show but was back in comfortable jeans and a floral top as she arrived in Australia.

While playing, Murray will wear Under Armour's technical T-shirt that has been developed to provide compression to athletes' muscles and wick perspiration off the skin.

The brand, who do clothing for men and women, say the T-shirt 'works with your body to regulate temperature and enhance performance.'

The tennis star played in black and white versions of the lightweight shirt in Abu Dhabi. 

And he certainly put the fabric technology to the test today as he played in temperatures reaching 44 degrees in Perth.

His white T-shirt was saturated with sweat by the end of the match and the Scot joked afterwards that the conditions were not what he was used to growing up in Dunblane, Scotland.

He said: 'It was a bit of an eye-opener when we arrived at the practice court this morning and it was 44 degrees outside. I'm from a small town in Scotland and the weather is not quite like that there.' 

When he signed his contract with Under Armour, Murray said: 'I am very honoured and excited to be joining Team Under Armour and to help them tell their story globally.

'They are committed to providing innovative apparel, accessories, and footwear, with an unmatched focus on training and performance.'

Murray is the most famous British sports star to be sponsored by the U.S. brand who also have American football players, skiers and snowboarders on their books. 

They have already made inroads into promoting themselves in the UK by sponsoring football team Tottenham Hotspur.

Accessorising: Murray's new kit has been colour coordinated with his trainers - which are still adidas as Under Armour are currently working on their own footwear for the star

On the up: Under Armour began with just a T-shirt - created to regulate an athletes' body temperature - before becoming a major sports brand

The brand's story is a classic 'rags to riches' tale. Plank went from selling T-shirts from his grandmother's house to becoming the U.S's second bestselling sportsbrand behind Nike a decade later.

He started the business with just $15,000 (£9,800) savings plus as much money as he could loan from credit cards. 

Of those early days, Kevin told The Washington Post: 'It was a challenge, and I had to learn to really focus on my business. But acting like a professional company and running it out of a residential neighborhood is not the easiest thing to do.'

His big break came when Under Armour became the official supplier to the American football NFL Europe League.

New brand ambassador: Murray has played in black and white kit from Under Armour, who were founded by Kevin Plank. The football player turned enterpreneur has become a billionaire thanks to the brand's success

Expansion: The sports brand state that they started out with the 'simple plan to make a superior T-shirt' and are now sponsoring global stars like Murray, whose contract is estimated at £15m

Now the football player turned entrepreneur is a self-made billionaire thanks to the rise and rise of his brand.

Speaking of his success, Plank said: 'Success doesn't happen quickly. It happens from doing the same thing over and over, becoming great at it, and delivering great value to consumers. It takes time, and that’s why I'm such an advocate for, if you have an idea, get it out there, find out if it can sell, and if does, move to version two, move to version three, and find a way.'  

While well-known in their home country, signing global stars like Murray will propel them to even greater heights.

The tennis player will be a brand ambassador and feature in major marketing campaigns. 

On signing Murray, Ryan Kuehl, Under Armour said: 'Signing Andy is really a special moment for the brand, as we continue to elevate and diversify our athlete roster and expand our international presence. Andy's remarkable character, competitive spirit and unmatched ability make him the perfect fit for our family.'

The sports brand state that they started out with the 'simple plan to make a superior T-shirt' but have since branched into making other sporting clothing and accessories.

Tying the knot: Murray popped the question to long term girlfriend Kim Sears last year and the pair are likely to wed this October

However, they have yet to develop tennis shoes for Murray so he will continue to wear adidas trainers until they have developed footwear specifically for him - a process which is estimated to take at least six months. 

The brand showed a flair for fashion by matching the colour of his shorts to his adidas shoes. 

Murray will be hoping to improve his form in 2015 after he dropped to a year-end ranking of number six in the world.

However, while 2014 may not have been a vintage year for him in terms of sporting achievement, it was a special one for him in his personal life as he popped the question to long-term girlfriend, Kim Sears, 26.

Judy has revealed that the wedding is likely to take place in October this year.
