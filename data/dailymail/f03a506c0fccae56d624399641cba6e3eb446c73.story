Saturday Night Live has used a sketch to condemn the recent Senate report revealing the CIA's torture techniques by interviewing the two 'psychologists' who headed up the program.

During the opening of the NBC show an interviewer named Charlie Rose - played by Taran Kilam - speaks to the audience, criticizing the work of the intelligence agency.

He says: 'The report is like a menu from the Cheesecake Factory. [It's] 660  sickening pages, yet I couldn't put it down.'

Sketch: The opening of SNL saw two 'psychologists' who spearheaded the CIA's torture program interviewed. They said the effort was based on teamwork because 'there is no "I" in torture'

Two fictitious psychologists, played by Bobby Moynihan and Kyle Mooney, are then introduced, claiming to have arranged the torture program - from which they reportedly received $80millon.

Asked how responsible they felt, the pair said: 'It was teamwork, you have to remember, there is no "I" in torture.'

They then talk about their career prospects, feeling they will be 'pigeonholed'.

'We don't want to be known as those rectal-feeding guys,' they add.

The pair then go on to talk about other things they are responsible for in society - including the self-service checkout. 

Describing it as a form of 'torture', they say you are forced to scan your groceries yourself with a cashier watching. Then, at the end, the screen asks you to get a cashier.

They also claimed to have done 'all customer service for Time Warner Cable'. 

The show was hosted by Martin Freeman who started the show by delving into current affairs.

During his introduction speech he said: 'It is great to be in New York at Christmas. The Rockefeller Christmas Tree, Radio City Music Hall and, of course, racial unrest.'

Condemnation: The interviewer, Charlie Rose, said the report read like a menu from 'The Cheesecake Factory, 660 sickening pages, yet I couldn't put it down

Later on he performed a sketch where he played Bilbo Baggins in the setting of the British version of The Office TV show. 

On Thursday CIA Director John Brennan said some agency officers used "abhorrent" methods on detainees captured following the Sept. 11 attacks and said it was "unknowable" whether harsh interrogation techniques yielded useful intelligence.

With his agency under fire in the aftermath of a U.S. Senate report detailing the CIA's use of torture on detainees after the 2001 attacks, Brennan rejected the report's conclusion that the agency had deceived the White House, Congress and the public about its interrogation program.
