A miniature weight has been designed to help people improve the strength of their thumbs.

The ‘Thumbell’ was designed after new research revealed that 26 million Britons suffer thumb pain because of too much gadget use.

The survey, commissioned by O2, found that 43 per cent of people have had thumb pain in the last five years.

A miniature weight has been designed to help people improve the strength of their thumbs

Over half of the people interviewed said their thumbs got tired when they use their smartphone, and 41 per cent said they had to rest their thumbs when using their mobile.

To tackle the problem, O2 is piloting the 65 gram ‘Thumbell’ - a fitness weight designed to strengthen the thumb and fingers.

The fitness tool is currently being trialled by staff to ensure their thumbs are ready for when the company goes 4G, as part of O2’s ‘Fit for 4G’ campaign.

The idea of the campaign is to strengthen people’s thumbs and fingers before they switch to 4G as the faster operating speed will mean their digits are put under even more pressure to work quickly.

It was released after a survey revealed that 26 million Britons suffer thumb pain from too much gadget use

BMI Healthcare upper limb services 
manager, Nicola Goldsmith, said: ‘The thumb is being used more than ever
for rapid, fine movements.

‘We are seeing gadget related injuries increasing and it’s time we gave our digits a helping hand.

‘The “Thumbells” provide a fun way for getting us to focus on thumb protection.’

The survey also found 66 per cent of Britons wish their thumbs were faster and more dexterous.

Ms Goldsmith said: ‘I can only see thumb use and the levels of thumb injuries increasing. We tone, train and maintain most of our muscles but why not the thumb? Let’s prevent rather than mend and look after our most precious limb.’

In Britain, 43 per cent of people claim to have had thumb pain in the last five years

David Johnson, general manager devices for O2 in the UK said: ‘We know our customers are using their thumbs more than ever.

‘Data use is experiencing exponential growth and with 4G just around the corner, we want to make sure our customers are ready to make the most of what 4G will offer them. Whether it’s choosing tracks to listening to, scrolling through videos or playing mobile games.

‘We’re all using our thumbs to interact with the technological revolution, and as such it’s important we keep our most precious digits healthy.’
