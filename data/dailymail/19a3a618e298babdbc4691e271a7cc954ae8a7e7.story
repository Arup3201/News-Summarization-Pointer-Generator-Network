As the father of tennis champs Venus and Serena Williams, Richard Williams is a controversial figure who has earned a reputation as someone willing to question the sport’s establishment.

His unorthodox methods were undoubtedly instrumental in helping turn his daughters into two of the biggest names in the women’s game, but it came at a price.

He split from their mom Oracene and married Lakeisha Graham in 2009, and as his daughter’s careers have progressed he has taken a less viable role and is less involved in their coaching.

Richard Williams, the controversial father of tennis champs Venus and Serena, has written a book about growing up in abject poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana, and his run-ins with the Ku Klux Klan

As well as becoming father to a young son, Dylan, and pursuing an interest in photography, Williams has also found the time to write a book about his life, Black And White: The Way I See It.

In his book, Williams tells of his early life growing up in abject poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana, as one of six children and the only son of single mother Julia Mae.

He writes that his life has been defined by his father R.D. leaving the family forcing him to fend for himself at an early age.

‘As early as I remember, I hated my name because my father’s love did not come with it,’ he writes in an extract first published in the New York Daily News.

‘It would always remind me of the man who left me alone, who abused my mother, and who put me way behind the starting line in the race of life.’

Williams took it upon himself to provide for his mom and sisters by any means he could, which involved going into the woods and hunting bullfrogs to eat, and fish, shooting rabbits, and stealing chickens.

‘I became fascinated with stealing at the age of eight. I don’t know if the thrill was being able to get away with a crime, or that the crime was against the white man,’ writes Williams.

Aged 12 he started a produce garden and sold his fruit and vegetables at a farm stand, whatever he couldn’t grow - watermelons, peaches, strawberries, etc - he would steal from white people.

As his business thrived, Williams was able to move his family into a better house.

The Ku Klux Klan rampaged through the South, confident it could violate black people with impunity, writes Richard Williams

Shreveport was controlled by the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan, says Williams. ‘The Klan rampaged through the South, confident it could violate us with impunity,’ he writes.

A friend, called Lil Man, was caught by the Klan for stealing and his body was found days later hanging from a tree with his hands cut off.

The murder was never investigated by the local police.

Williams also had a run-in with Klan members and recalls a crowd - including his own father - looking on and watching while three white men beat him in the street.

‘It is a terrible thing to be so unloved, to know your father would rather let you die than lift a finger to help you, to watch him run off and leave you all alone,’ writes Williams.

‘It was a rejection so cold it remains burnt in my memory and, in the end, it did what even white people could never do, hurt me so deep in my soul that I have never forgotten or forgiven.

Such was Williams anger at the injustice that he experienced that just prior to leaving Shreveport for Chicago he decided to exact revenge on the Klan.

After securing the white robes of a local Klansman, Williams dressed up and went to a nearby white neighborhood where he viciously attacked a white farmer and his teenage son with a stick

'My hatred was up, and so was my longing to pay back somebody, anybody, for everything that ever happened to me,’ he writes.
