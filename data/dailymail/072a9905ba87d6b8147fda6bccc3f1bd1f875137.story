An ice cream seller has been warned he could be evicted for serving cones with a flake - because it breaches the terms of his lease.

Alex Mills, 23, has operated milkshake bar Shake and Bake on Bognor Regis promenade in West Sussex for three years.

But he has become embroiled in a battle with Arun District Council over the ice creams he has also been selling to customers.

Fuming: Milkshake bar owner Alex Mills says he cannot understand why he isn't allowed to sell ice creams with a flake

Licensing bosses say out of fairness to other outlets on the seafront, he should not be selling traditional '99' ice cream cones with a flake.

Mr Mills was sent a letter informing him a customer had been spotted eating one sold from his shop and that this was a violation of the terms of his lease.

He was warned to cease selling such ice creams or face enforcement action including the forfeiture of his lease.

Mr Mills said: 'It just seems like one big joke to me and I’ll fight it all the way. Apparently in my lease it says I can sell ice cream but I can’t sell it with any additives, such as flakes, sauce or sprinkles.

'The crazy thing is I can sell them separately but not together. It is ludicrous. If I do sell them together I have been told enforcement action will be taken.'

Dispute: Council bosses say it is not fair on other seafront outlets if Mr Mills also serves ice creams with a flake

He added: 'When people buy an ice cream the majority of them want a flake to go with it - if I had to tell them "sorry, I can sell you the ice cream but not with a flake", I would lose about 80 per cent of my business.

'I got a letter from the council which said I was spotted selling an ice cream which had a flake and red sauce on it. It says it will be looked into and enforcement action, which could include the forfeiture of my lease, could be taken.'

Town mayor Paul Wells has hit out at the ban, saying: 'It is ludicrous you can sell an ice cream and not a flake to go with it.'

A spokesman for Arun District Council said: 'We like to have a balance of concessions along Bognor Regis seafront and Mr Mills freely entered into a lease with the council last year to operate his milkshake concession.

'He personally negotiated and agreed the terms of the lease. The council has not varied the terms of his lease since it was agreed. The council has been in lengthy discussions with Mr Mills on a variety of other lease issues over many months.

'As he has very recently demonstrated an apparent willingness to work within the terms of his agreement, the council has agreed to a minor variation to what he can sell from his concession as long as he complies fully with the terms of his lease.'

The spokesman added that the lease allowed Mr Mills to sell soft vanilla ice cream, but not put any signs up to advertise this out of fairness to other existing concessionaires.
