Mary Poppins star Dick Van Dyke has been rescued after his car burst into flames as he drove on the Los Angeles freeway.

The 87-year-old veteran actor had a narrow escape and was saved just in time after his Jaguar caught fire.

It is not yet known what caused the incident, which occurred on Monday afternoon.

A narrow escape: Dick Van Dyke was rescued on Monday after his car burst into flames on a Los Angeles freeway

Fireball: The freeway was shut as the fire raged

Hero: The 87-year-old was pulled out of the car by a man who was driving by and spotted the vehicle smoking

A man named Jason Pennington saved the day after spotting a car full of smoke on the side of the road on the 101 freeway in the Calabasas area of the city.

The passerby turned hero told TMZ that he saw an elderly man hunched over the wheel of the vehicle and sprung into action.

He pulled up and saw the actor struggling inside after running over to the smoking car.

Dick did not require medical attention after the incident, although was apparently slightly disoriented.

His wife of 18 months Arlene Silver, 41, picked him up from the scene and drove him home.

Arlene
posted a Vine video which showed the star's car burnt to a crisp 
following the accident, along with Dick chatting to a police officer 
while dressed in a white polo shirt and grey trousers.

'Van Dyke's melted car @iammrvandy He's fine thank God!!' the make-up artist wrote alongside the clip.

Hero: The actor was found in his Jaguar, which he is pictured with in February, by a passerby

And the man himself even managed to make light of the scary situation as he shared a snap of his destroyed car with the words: 'Used Jag for sale REAL CHEAP!!'

Dick started his career as a radio DJ in the late 1940s, before starring on Broadway and then television.

He
made his film debut in Bye Bye Birdie, and is perhaps best known for 
his roles in Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and on the small 
screen in Diagnosis Murder.

Most recently Dick has appeared in Night At The Museum and in TV series Murder 101.

By his side: Dick's wife of 18 months Arlene, who he is pictured with at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January, picked him up from the scene and drove him home

Veteran star: Dick is perhaps best known for his role in Mary Poppins. He is seen here in a still from the 1964 Disney movie with co-stars Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber and Julie Andrews
