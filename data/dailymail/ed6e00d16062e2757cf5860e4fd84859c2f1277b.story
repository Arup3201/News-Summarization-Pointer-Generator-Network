A British holidaymaker broke down in tears as she told a Spanish court how she was allegedly gang-raped by three men at knife-point who offered her a lift home from a Spanish nightclub.

The woman, now 42, said they forced her into sex after taking her to remote wasteland, brandishing a knife and drugging her with a mystery liquid.

She told the one-day trial in Malaga via videolink from a court in Britain: 'They were laughing and doing whatever they wanted to me.

The alleged gang-rape happened in 2001 after the woman became separated from friends she been out with in the Costa del Sol resort Benalmadena

'I was scared and felt I had to be compliant.

'They pushed me on the ground after they finished with me and they took my shoes.

'I collapsed. The next thing I knew it was morning and I was in a place in the mountains I didn't know with no houses around.'

The alleged gang-rape happened in the early hours of November 4, 2001 after the holidaymaker, then 30, became separated from friends she had been out with in the Costa del Sol resort of Benalmadena.

She reported the rape later that day and identified three men from CCTV footage as the attackers who offered her a lift home in a 'small, red car'. 

Police failed to identify the trio at the time.

But one of the defendants, Spaniard Francisco Santiago, was arrested in 2010 when detectives detained him on an unrelated matter and matched a DNA sample they took to one they had obtained from the alleged victim's clothes nine years earlier.

His brother Mariano and cousin David Santiago were arrested and charged after he told police they had been with him that night. 

They have been warned they face 26 years in jail if convicted after taking the witness stand yesterday.

Their alleged victim had to give her evidence in two 25-minute sessions after breaking down halfway through and asking for a break to recompose herself.

State prosecutor Maria Teresa Verdugo described how the men took it in turns to rape the tourist in a Seat Ibiza after tricking her into believing they would give her a lift back to her holiday apartment.

It is claimed they knocked her unconscious during the sex attack.

Ms Teresa Verdugo said: 'Her account of what happened that night stands out for its brutality and violence.

'She is saying now what she has said right from the start.

'The jail sentences we are demanding reflect the violence these men used and the victim's defencelessness.'

The defendants, aged 22 to 24 at the time, told the court their DNA was on the victim's clothes because she had performed a sex act on one inside the nightclub and the other two afterwards in a nearby car park.

Francisco claimed he made no mention of it in police interviews prior to the court case because his memory had failed him after so many years.

David Santiago, a father-of-two, said: 'I swear on my children's life this woman is not telling the truth.

'I have two young kids and I would never be capable of committing such horrendous crimes.'

State prosecutor Maria Teresa Verdugo asked the court to convict two of the defendants on three charges of rape and a single charge of wounding and sentence them each to 31 years in jail.

The judge said they will be reserving judgement until a later date.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
