'Neighbours from hell': Steven and Fiona Young, pictured, carried out a nuisance campaign in an attempt to force out Peter and Lesley Raymond, a court found

It was supposed to be an idyllic second home, a rural Lake District retreat far away from the troubles of the rest of the world.

But little did Peter and Lesley Raymond know when they settled on the lavish £600,000 Lin Crag Farm in Blawith, Cumbria, that they were buying in to a ruinous feud with 'neighbours from hell'.

Mr and Mrs Raymond came to discover that their only neighbours, Steven and Fiona Young, would terrorise their home for years.

And although their luxurious, well-appointed new home came complete with a helicopter garage, games room, bar and indoor badminton court, it was little comfort compared with the intractable family next door.

The Youngs had lived in the neighbouring seven-bedroom Lynn Cragg Cottage for years - but had lived in the larger farmhouse decades ago and resented the new owners, who bought the property in 2009.

Rotting rubbish was abandoned on their property, fences were damaged and their CCTV cameras were covered in paint - while at one point the Raymonds were even confronted with a sinister threat implying they could be murdered.

But after a court battle - in which Mr and Mrs Raymond argued that their belligerent neighbours had slashed the value of their house - the Youngs have been left with a £600,000 bill.

The family sued for for harassment, trespass and nuisance - and eventually won their case.

The judge awarded them £196,000 damages, and the Youngs were left with an additional £400,000 in legal fees to pay - £200,000 for themselves and the same again for their opponents.

Court papers show that at one point Mr Young told Mrs Raymond: 'I have lived here all my life and also all my family have lived here all my life, all their lives, hundreds of years, and you come in and really try to mess with s**t and it’s not on'.

They logged incidents of rubbish mounting up or being ‘thrown’ into their courtyard, the Youngs’ dog and guinea fowl trespassing and defecating on their property and footballs being kicked against their walls.

In one incident, Mr Young was captured sticking two fingers up and mooning for the CCTV cameras.

In one flashpoint, just weeks after the West Cumbria shootings, Mr Young told Mrs Raymond in a confrontation she recorded: 'We can all be pushed further than we want to go. Look at that poor guy in Whitehaven'.

It was a reference to Derrick Bird who murdered 12 people 2010.

Mr Raymond, 67, and wife Lesley, 57, bought Lin Crag Farm next door to the Youngs’ Lynn Cragg Cottage to use as a second home to their residence in East Sussex.

The large estate is a mile from the centre of Blawith down a single-track lane set in open countryside.

But the Raymonds were unaware that the property, bought for around £600,000 five years ago, had been the historic family home of Mr Young, 53, a former pub landlord at the Red Lion at Lowick.

He lived in it until it was sold in 1965 by his late father. The family then moved into Lynn Cragg Cottage next door.

Though the Youngs cited an old agreement about leaving rubbish in the farmhouse so it could be more easily collected, the court decided that dumping bags on their land was part of a nuisance campaign to devalue the property and drive them away.

A judge ruled in favour of the Raymonds and dismissed as ‘delusion’ claims from the Youngs that they had fallen prey to an ‘elaborate conspiracy’.

It emerged in the hearing that previous owners of the farmhouse had also complained, with a previous resident calling them ‘neighbours from hell’.

In his judgement, Recorder Duncan Smith found: 'Mr Young has been unable to accept the fact that he has no legal dominion over that property.

'It is clear from an examination of the historical evidence that it was his intention to make the life of those who occupy the farm a misery; that his campaign of belligerence has continued since the death of his father, that he has a deep-seated aversion to those wealthy enough to afford a second home the size of the farm, and that the notoriety of his conduct is an open secret in the locality.”

The Recorder described Mrs Young as: ‘a plain-speaking lady with fixed interpretations of events to the point of being intransigent’.

The Youngs have now left the cottage and rent another property in a neighbouring village. They deny that they are 'some kind of Asbo-family' and say the court case has 'destroyed' them.

Mrs Young said: 'They have painted this picture of us as some kind of Asbo-family and we’re not like that at all. We’ve lived round here all our lives and have a good reputation and this has destroyed us. We’re not perfect but we’re good people.'

'They have made Steven out to be this big, aggressive man and he’s not that at all. He’s a pussycat but there’s only so far you can be pushed.'

The Raymonds’ legal team did not respond to requests for a comment.
