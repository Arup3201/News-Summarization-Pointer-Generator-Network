Manchester United might have splashed the cash on pedigree creative talents such as Angel Di Maria in the summer transfer window, but it was defender Phil Jones taking their corners at Loftus Road on Saturday. 

It was a bizarre move from Louis van Gaal during The Red Devils' 2-0 win that left plenty of fans scratching their heads.  

The Dutchman has faced some criticism during his time as United manager for over complicating his tactics and formations.

Angel Di Maria joined Manchester United in the summer from Real Madrid for a reported £59.7m 

Against QPR, the travelling United fans chanted '4-4-2' to protest against their manager's initial 3-3-2-2 line-up.

Nevertheless, United ran out winners against the Hoops and currently sit fourth in the Premier League table, two points behind third placed Southampton. 

Van Gaal spent close to £150 million in the summer and is under huge pressure to qualify for next season's Champions League.
