Perhaps they’re listening to Jamie Foxx's ‘Blame It (On the Alcohol)’, ‘Pass the Courvoisier’ by Busta Rhymes, or a bit of J-Kwon’s ‘Tipsy’.

U.S. teenagers are hearing about 34 references to alcohol brand names in music daily - and a study says it’s mostly down to rap, R&B and hip-hop.

This could be increasing youth alcohol addiction by encouraging young people to start drinking as children and carrying on as they get older.

Researchers have slammed the ‘luxury lifestyle characterised by degrading sexual activity, wealth, partying, violence and the use of drugs’.

An Addiction journal study said alcohol companies ‘retroactively reward’ artists with sponsorships when songs featuring their brands perform well.

Many brands in lyrics are those favoured by underage female drinkers, the study by Pittsburgh and Dartmouth universities said, reported ABC.

Alcohol is often referred to positively, with the brands associated with wealth 63 per cent of the time and sex 59 per cent.

vehicles 39 per cent, reported ABC.

‘The “gangsta” mystique is really about aggressive self-indulgence,’ New York University professor Mark Miller told ABC.

‘It's highly consumeristic and not in any way socially conscious or beneficial to anyone's health.’

More than two in five high school students drank alcohol and one in five binge drank in 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Rapper Ludacris launched his own brand of liquor in 2009 - Conjure Vodka - and others such as Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and P. Diddy have done the same.

But Jake Jamieson, editor of the blog Liquor Snob, said: ‘I think the study overstates it a bit. Kids are not the only ones listening to rap.

‘With beer commercials during football games, they are doing the same thing,' he told ABC.
