Hundreds of convicted rapists, kidnappers, sex attackers and arsonists have escaped jail sentences, despite government pledges to end ‘soft’ sentences.

Of almost 200,000 convictions for serious offences, just 52,000 were jailed and of those only 6,715 were sentenced to more than four years behind bars.

Half of arsonists, burglars, sex attackers and people convicted of conspiracy to murder, child abduction and sex with under-13s avoided jail.

The Ministry of Justice revealed the figures showing how for some serious offences including child abduction, conspiracy to murder and assault more than half of criminals avoided jail

Among those walking free from court in 2012 were 736 arsonists, 69 rapists, 1,177 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 who killed by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers.

Only 14 per cent of the 4,659 people convicted of common assault were jailed.

Almost 450 were found guilty of a threat or conspiracy to murder, but only 216 were imprisoned.

Just
 45 of 93 child abductors were jailed and only half of the 2,324 people 
convicted of sexual assault were given jail terms, with just 262 lasting
 more than four years.

Almost half of sex attackers walked free from court. Only 1,177 of convictions for sexual assault led to a sentence.

Labour suggested that the reluctance to send some serious offenders to jail could be linked to a desire to save money

Of

only 123 were imprisoned and five spent less than six months behind 
bars.

Only 519 of those convicted of having sex with under-16s were jailed.

Labour
 questioned whether the reluctance of judges to hand down custodial 
sentences was fuelled by the need to save money and limit the prison 
population.

Fewer than a 
quarter (23 per cent) of the 615 convicted of cruelty or neglect of 
children and 27 per cent of people who caused death by dangerous driving
 were given prison sentences.

In
 2012, 1,354 people were convicted of arson, of which 618 were given 
immediate custodial sentences, including 135 jailed for more than four 
years.

The coalition has repeatedly claimed to be ensuring tougher sentences are handed down to criminals.

In
 October Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'This government is on 
the side of people who play by the rules and want to get on. We need to 
teach criminals a lesson; you will be punished for your crime.'

Tonight Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice, 
told MailOnline: ‘The British public will rightly question why some 
people found guilty of very serious and violent crimes are avoiding 
going to prison.

‘Victims of crime need confidence that those guilty of these serious crimes are properly punished.

‘There is a concern that one of the reasons for so many non-custodial sentences for serious offences is to save money.

‘For
 many of the most heinous offences going to prison is the only 
appropriate option to both punish and rehabilitate. This government 
needs to get a grip on this, and ensure that dangerous and violent 
crimes are properly dealt with.’

And Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: ‘Once again we see
the criminal justice system letting down victims of serious crimes because the
courts are too soft on paedophiles and other horrendous criminals.

‘The nature of these crimes dictates that the number one
priority is the victims of appalling crimes and keeping them safe. We need
strong deterrents and that means tougher sentences.’

Douglas Carswell , Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘The criminal
justice system is run for the convenience of bureaucrats – not in the interests
of justice.

‘If we had a proper Conservative administration we could be
tackling the problem the way Michael Howard tackled soggy thinking at the heart
of government two decades ago.

‘Unfortunately we’ve got a quad at the heart of this
government who seem to veto anything that looks like proper Conservative
policy.’

Latest figures for the last week of 2013 show all but 1,561 of the 85,953 prison places were filled, with many jails are breaking point.

Of the 39,836 convicted of possession of 
drugs, only 1,161 or three per cent were sent to prison, along with only
 3,344 of 6,851 convicted drug dealers jailed.

A third of the 534 convicted of violent disorder avoided jail, along with a quarter of the 335 kidnappers convicted in the courts.

Even among those who are jailed, thousands are given sentences of less than six months

While the majority of convicted rapists were jailed, 69 of the 1,145 convicted kept their freedom along with 13 of the 166 convicted of manslaughter.

Even among those who are jailed, many are given soft
sentences of less than six months, including 2,629 burglars, 1,057 fraudsters,
6,838 convicted of assault and 76 robbers.

The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a parliamentary question.

Justice Secretary Mr Grayling said: 'Since 2010 those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer and we are continuing to overhaul sentencing to ensure that the toughest sentencing measures are available to the courts. 

'I'll take no lessons on being tough on crime from a Labour party that let thousands of criminals out of prison early because they hadn't provided enough places, who let thousands  of offenders off with a slap on the wrist caution instead of proper punishment, and who, to add insult to injury, failed to get any money from prisoners' earnings for their victims.

'Under Labour's watch, reoffending rates simply remained the same, and they had no idea what they were going to do about it.  Our reforms will help criminals away from a life of crime - and help them stay away from it.'
