It has been almost one year since Osama Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs, but his feuding wives are still at war with each other.

The youngest of the late Al-Qaeda leader's five widows, Amal, 29, had to be pulled apart from his eldest bride Khairiah, 61, after the pair began brawling in a Pakistan prison.

The fight was triggered by Amal's suspicions that Khairiah leaked details of Bin Laden's whereabouts to the U.S. authorities shortly before his death last May.

Guards have now been ordered to make sure their paths never again cross.

Ladies' man: Two of Osama Bin Laden's wives, including his youngest bride Amal (right), had to be pulled apart by Pakistani security personnel after becoming embroiled in a catfight

The pair have been in custody in 
Islamabad since their shared husband's demise, along with a third wife 
and eight of Bin Laden's 20 children.

A source at the country's ISI intelligence service told the Sun: 'Amal described Khairiah as "the real killer of Bin Laden".

'Khairiah accused Amal of sticking to Osama like a prostitute who wanted sex 24 hours a day.'

The two women did not get on when they lived together with Bin Laden, and a third wife, in his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

They also shared the compound with eight of his children and five grandchildren.

As Bin Laden's youngest wife, Amal shared his bedroom, while his second bride was one floor down.

Trouble arose when Saudi-born Khairiah showed up in early 2011 and moved into the bedroom on the floor below.

She was upset by Bin Laden’s perceived favouritism of Amal.

Others
 in the family, crammed into the three-story villa where Bin Laden would
 eventually be killed in a raid on May 2, were convinced that the eldest
 wife intended to betray the Al-Qaeda leader.

In transcripts of ISI interviews 
released yesterday, Amal said: 'Osama loved me the most. We used to talk
 about romance - other things apart from Al Qaeda things.

'In the last days, he felt he was 
being tracked down by the U.S. forces and their allies. He said his 
death was to be orchestrated by Khairiah or family. He was ready to face it.'

Home: Bin Laden's three wives and two daughters lived with him in the Abbottabad hideout just 200 yards from a military base which was raided last year

Going, going, gone: The compound was destroyed last year to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage

Shaukat Qadir, a retired 
Pakistani army officer, spent months researching the circumstances 
surrounding Bin Laden's stay in Abbottabad, where he had lived since 
2005.

He was given rare access to transcripts of Pakistani intelligence's 
interrogation of Amal.

Bin Laden’s 
home life was stirred up when Khairiah joined the fray.

There was 
already bad blood between Khairiah, who married bin Laden in the late 
1980s, and Amal because of Bin Laden's favouritism for the younger Yemeni
 woman, Mr Qadir said he was told by tribal leaders who knew the family.

Even ISI officials who questioned Khairiah after the raid were daunted by her.

‘She is so aggressive that she borders on being intimidating,’ Mr Qadir said he was told by an ISI interrogator.

Amal
 stayed close to Bin Laden as he fled Afghanistan into Pakistan 
following the 2001 U.S. invasion. She took an active role in arranging 
protection for him and Bin Laden wanted her by his side, the tribal 
leaders told Qadir.

Khairiah fled Afghanistan in 2001 into 
Iran along with other bin Laden relatives and Al-Qaeda figures. She and 
others were held under house arrest in Iran until 2010, when Tehran let 
them leave in a swap for an Iranian diplomat kidnapped in Pakistan's 
frontier city of Peshawar.

Revenge motive: The ageing terrorist was bedding his youngest wife, while his eldest bride Khairiah had to sleep in a bedroom on the floor below

Khairiah showed up at Abbottabad in February or March 2011 and moved into the villa's second floor, Amal told her interrogators.

Khalid, Bin Laden's son with Siham, was suspicious, according to Amal's 
account. He repeatedly asked Khairiah why she had come.

At one point, 
she told him: ‘I have one final duty to perform for my husband.’

Khalid 
immediately told his father what she had said and warned that she 
intended to betray him.

Amal, who shared Khalid's fears, said Bin Laden was also suspicious but was unconcerned, acting as if fate 
would decide, according to Mr Qadir's recounting of the interrogation 
transcript.

There is no 
evidence Khairiah had any role in bin Laden's end.

Accounts by Pakistani
 and U.S. intelligence officials have made no 
mention of her.

Instead, U.S. officials have said a courier 
inadvertently led the CIA to the Abbottabad villa after they uncovered 
him in a monitored phone call.

Bin Laden had two marriages before Khairiah that ended in divorce and had more than 20 children with his various wives.

In addition to three wives, the 
commandos who raided the compound also found an 'extensive' collection 
of modern pornographic films.

The
 pornography recovered consisted of modern, electronically recorded 
video although it is unknown who at the home procured and or watched it.
