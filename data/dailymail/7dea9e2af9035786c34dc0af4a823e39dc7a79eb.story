Turf Moor will be the scene for NBC's first on-location live coverage of the Premier League, as the TV giants prepare for an action-packed weekend of football - starting at relegation-threatened Burnley.

The Clarets host Champions League chasing Arsenal on April 11, then the broadcasters will travel south to present a crucial Manchester derby at Old Trafford before finishing off at St.James' Park to watch Newcastle take on Liverpool and complete 18 hours of football.

Host Rebecca Lowe and pundits Robbie Earle, Kyle Martino and Robbie Mustoe will also be joined by their UK-based team of Arlo White, Lee Dixon, Graeme Le Saux and Steve Bower for a weekend of live Premier League action.

The studio team are to begin their show at Turf Moor and will be on screen for a total of eight hours including before, during and after the Gunners clash. 

Former Burnley defender Dixon will also treat the viewers to a tour of the 132-year-old stadium and will outline changes made by the club since he left in the late 1980s. 

It could add for special viewing if the Clarets manage to upset Arsenal like they did Manchester City and give their survival chances a major boost heading into the final stretch of the season.

Match of the Day front-man Gary Lineker will also play a part in the weekend takeover and will contribute to parts of the on-site coverage and lend his punditry expertise to the team.

Pierre Moossa, coordinating producer of NBC Sports Group's Premier League coverage, is excited about the development and looks forward to bringing the games closer to their viewers.

He said: 'One of our core principles has been to bridge the trans-Atlantic gap, and with our entire team on-site both in-stadium and pitch-side, we will be able to bring our audience closer to the action than ever before.' 

Wayne Rooney and his Manchester United team-mate will want to earn the bragging rights of the derby

The Manchester derby will add some spice to the chosen games, with both sides in the top four but desperate for victory for different reasons.

Manchester City are slowly losing ground on Chelsea in the race for the title and are in a position now where can't afford to slip-up. While rivals Manchester United are stuck in a battle for the Champions League places with Liverpool.

If United are beaten at home, then it will make Monday's game at St.James' Park a little bit more interesting.

Hapless Newcastle are all but safe from relegation and have nothing to play for but Brendan Rodgers' side will be going for jugular if Louis van Gaal's side give them an opportunity to close the gap.   

Brendan Rodgers still has faith his Liverpool side can finish in the top four and ahead of rivals United
