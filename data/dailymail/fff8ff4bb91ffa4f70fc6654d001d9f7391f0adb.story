Relations between the U.S. and Russia appeared to be as icy as ever Tuesday, as President Barack Obama attended a summit in Beijing alongside Vladimir Putin.

The President of Russia was photographed sinisterly smirking at Mr Obama as the two arrived at a special session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation on Tuesday.

Putin also tried to make small talk with the Leader of the Free World, noting how beautiful the convention center where the summit was being held was, in English.

'Yes,' Obama coldly replied, according to journalists who witnessed the scene.

The bumbling exchange comes just months after President Obama warned Putin directly, not to continue intervening in the turmoil in neighboring Ukraine, a warning that Putin did not heed.

Sources say the pair actually spoke several times at the summit, but at no point delved into any of the issues that divide them. 

This week's conference has been filled with endless international relations entertainment, including strange Star Trek-style outfits the world leaders wore for a group photo.

'Obama wearing Star Trek jacket in China? Someone please beam him up,' wrote Steve Miller on Twitter.

However, AFP journalist Katy Lee pointed out that the APEC has a 'rich tradition' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit.

'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year.

Meanwhile at the shoot, U.S. president Barack Obama appeared in no mood to break the ice with his Russian counterpart, and even looked away when the two crossed paths.

Putin took centre stage at the official photocall, placed at the middle of leaders next to Chinese president and event host Xi Jinping.

Mr Obama, however, was left wedged between the wife of Indonesia's president and South Korea's leader, Park Geun-Hye, on the periphery of the photograph. 

When the photograph was taken and the heads of state filed off stage, Obama seemed to turn his head as Putin came past, rather than catch his eye.

The two leaders last met in June, when they exchanged a few words during a ceremony in France marking the D-Day invasion anniversary.

With Russia-West ties at their lowest point since the Cold War, amid the dispute over Ukraine, the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible.

And, as these pictures show, today was no different.

However, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, has said that no meeting has been set but that Putin and Obama have 'a good chance' to meet on the sidelines. Ushakov emphasized that Putin wasn't shunning such a meeting.

In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice said that while there were no plans for a formal meeting between Obama and Putin, 'I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication.'
