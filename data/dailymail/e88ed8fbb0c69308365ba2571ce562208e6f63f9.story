Glenn Hoddle insists Luis Suarez must be banned for his alleged bite on Giorgio Chiellini, adding that such an incident is worthy of a prison sentence.

'Kids are watching the World Cup all around the world, and what Luis Suarez did is the worst thing you could see in football. If that happens on the street somewhere you’d be put in prison,' he wrote for WilliamHill.com.

'No matter how good a player Suarez is, he deserves to be banned for biting Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder. The Italian had done absolutely nothing to provoke being bitten like that, the same as with Branislav Ivanovic.

'I don’t want to see one of the best players in the world banned, but he has to be. I’m sure Fifa will review the video evidence, as the referee took no action so couldn’t have seen it.

'How many matches he will be banned for is a matter for Fifa - it could two or three games or it could be the rest of the tournament.

'I cannot believe this is the third time he has bitten an opponent, as he did it first at Ajax, before the incident with Ivanovic and now this.

'You can see the way Suarez celebrated at the end of the game after his two goals against England, compared to how he celebrated at the end of this game, he knew something had happened and he knew he would be found out.'
