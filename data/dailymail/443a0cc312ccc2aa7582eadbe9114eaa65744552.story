Jailed: Michael Goldsmith, 43, of Anglesey, arranged to meet men at hotels in Bangor and Menai Bridge

A Harrow-educated conman who failed to deliver on his promise to pay a male escort's £11,000 university fees in return for sex has been jailed.

Michael Goldsmith, 43, of Anglesey, North Wales - educated at Harrow School in North-West London - had previously been sent to prison for a similar offence, Mold Crown Court heard.

He had arranged to meet men at hotels in Bangor and Menai Bridge through mobile phone app Grindr and the Hello Boys website - and promised to pay a male escort £11,000 for sex.

He made a cheque out to a university so that he could pay for his course - and also wrote out a £5,000 personal cheque to the male escort, who was in his 20s and doing a master's degree.

But both bounced and he also left the hotel without paying for the room, said Simon Rogers, prosecuting.

Sexual activity took place between the two men before Goldsmith contacted other men via the app on his phone and another male joined them.

Goldsmith said he wanted to watch them performing sex acts. The defendant left, saying he was married and had to return to his family - but arranged to see the escort the following day.

He turned up, then said he had to leave because his wife had followed him, and claimed he would return with cash instead of the cheques. But he never did, the court was told.

The man, who was registered with an escort service, presented the cheques - but they bounced.

On another occasion, Goldsmith promised to pay a man £1,000 after posting a picture of someone other than himself on the app. He posed as a young man in his 20s, and said he was handsome.

That man initially refused to get involved and deleted the app. But he later saw a true picture of the defendant when he reloaded the app and realised it was the same man.

He was persuaded by the offer of money to meet him in a hotel. In the room he was told they would discuss money later, and Goldsmith watched as he and another young man performed sex acts.

But he left without paying and when later contacted, the defendant told him: ‘Why should I pay you and that d*******. You were c*** anyway.’

Goldsmith told him to ‘learn by his mistakes’ and said ‘you never know who you might meet out there.’

Jailing him for two years, Judge Niclas Parry branded him a cruel conman who placed no value on decency. Goldsmith sought to satisfy his sexual desires on the basis of lies and deceit.

Goldsmith had done precisely the same thing in 2005, 2008 and 2011. He was on licence from a previous prison sentence when he committed the latest offences.

The judge said it ‘beggar's belief’ that some of his victims were prepared to accept payment for sexual services by cheque - and that they considered someone like him as someone capable of trust.

It was a very unusual case of fraud for which he considered the sentencing guidelines did not apply, he said.

Richard Thomas, defending, said that his client came from a wealthy family and was educated at Harrow. But within a matter of months or weeks of being released from prison he committed the same sort of offences again.

His only explanation was that when he returned home to Anglesey he felt isolated there. He did not have anything to do and fell back into the same pattern of offending.

Mr Thomas said that while the offences were based on sexual activity, he stressed that his client had been charged with fraud only and that the young men had entered into the agreements voluntarily.

Goldsmith knew that if he continued to behave in such a way then he would spend large parts of his adult life in custody, Mr Thomas said.

But he added Goldsmith had met a young man in custody and it was hoped the relationship would blossom. ‘If that is the case then he will have no need to get involved in such offending,’ he said.
