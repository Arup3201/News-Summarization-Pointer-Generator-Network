BITTER, gritty, bland…there’s no worse start to your morning than a terrible cup of coffee.

Indeed, making the perfect cup can be so difficult that many choose the easy option and make a tea instead.

Pukka cuppa: You can say goodbye to terrible coffee

But, thanks to the clever people at Douwe Egberts UK, help is at hand – with an app that turns you from coffee novice to world-class barista in a matter of seconds. Oh, and did I mention it’s free?

With The Perfect Cafetiere Coffee app, available for the iPhone, it gives users the expertise and the knowledge to create the perfect cup of coffee every time – based on taste and strength preferences.

It works by giving users the optimal brewing time and measurement of coffee to suit their need state.

It also features an integrated timer that alerts the user when the coffee has reached the ideal brew time and the cafetière is ready to be plunged.

Once the perfect cup has been mastered, the app allows users to share their new expertise and achievements via Facebook and Twitter with a series of accomplishment and skill badges.

So, for fans of Skyrim and Mass Effect, think of it as ‘levelling up’ your brewing skill. Maybe even adding ‘+2’ plunging ability.

It’s also packed with tips, hints and coffee facts along with a series of instructive videos and exclusive money-off coupons.

So, is it any good? Well, before this app, I always ‘took the plunge’ far too early. This resulted in a weak, watery beverage with as much drink appeal as pond water. So, yes. It actually works.

But it loses points as it’s just on the iPhone – which may leave a bitter taste in the mouths of Android and other smartphone users.

Still, there's always tea?
