Amanda Owen, 39,  juggles looking after 1,000 sheep with bringing up her SEVEN children and running a 2,000 acre sheep farm

Strangely, the job of 'shepherdess' didn't crop up when I was discussing career options with the teachers at my urban comprehensive.

Nor did 'hill farmer/mother/midwife/tractor driver/cook/cream tea maker/drystone wall builder/all-round dogsbody'. So how did a townie like me end up looking after 900 sheep and seven children on one of the most isolated farms in the Yorkshire Dales?

I swapped the bright lights for the hills when I was 19 years old. My mother had always hoped I might go for a job with Marks & Spencer in my home town of Huddersfield or, better still, become the next Jerry Hall (I'm 6ft tall).

But, inspired by the Yorkshire vet James Herriot, I'd set my heart on working with farm animals. After qualifying as a veterinary nurse I started out as a jobbing farmhand in the Lake District.

I didn't earn much, but I loved it. For the first time in my life I remember thinking, 'I've got to where I want to be.'

Best of all, my new job introduced me to two of the things I love most in the world: my husband, Clive Owen, and Ravenseat Farm, the most beautiful place on earth and my home for the past 17 years. When I say it's beautiful, I mean it.

Yes, it's bleak, it's remote (the nearest hospital is more than two hours away, of which more later) and the wind drives rain into the very fabric of the building.

When the electricity and water are off we live like the farmers who built the place centuries ago, carrying water from the river and cooking on a fire. But it's the best place to rear children and animals - I can't imagine living anywhere else. 

Not that I particularly appreciated its beauty the first time I saw it one murky night in October 1996. I'd been asked by a farmer I was working for in Cumbria to drive the 20 miles or so to Swaledale in Yorkshire to collect a ram from a friend of his.

As I pulled up in the farmyard at Ravenseat a barking sheepdog emerged from the darkness, followed by a pool of light from the house and a man's voice. 'Ga an' lie down,' shouted the voice. I assumed the command wasn't for me and, sure enough, the dog slunk away. 'Away in, mi lass, and I'll get t'kettle on,' the man said to me.

And that was it. There was no great feeling that I'd met my destiny; no instant romantic attraction. And yet I now know it was the defining moment of my life.

Clive and I got married in the summer of 2000, four years after we'd first met. I wore a wedding gown in gold shot silk - a white meringue wasn't my style, and anyway, it wouldn't have been practical. As it was, I could take the hoop off my dress and feed the calves between the reception and the party.

Nothing stops on a farm - not even for a wedding. We didn't go on our honeymoon for a week. It was shearing time, and that took priority. When the last sheep was clipped we set off for Ireland, stopping off at bed and breakfasts en route.

By the time we came home I was pregnant with our first child. I'd hoped to give birth at home - after all, I reasoned, I delivered calves and lambs, how difficult could it be?

I soon found out when I had to be rushed to hospital 60 miles away for an emergency Caesarean. Although we didn't know it then, it was the shape of things to come. Because it takes an ambulance an hour to get to us, three of our seven children were born in laybys and another at an Army garrison between our farm and the hospital.

It was an unconventional start for them, and I suppose their lives have continued that way. I don't take my children to playgrounds or the swimming baths, but they have a great outdoor life and, I hope, an idyllic upbringing in other ways. They eat properly, rarely watch TV and have lots of freedom.

For a while their favourite activity before the taxi to school arrived was pig riding - seeing how long they could stay on the back of a cavorting pig was, for a little while, a seriously competitive business. The Tamworth two, as we called the pigs we had at the time, took it all in good sport and seemed to relish flinging them off into the mud. I was relieved, though, when the pigs became part of breakfast itself, instead of a breakfast-time challenge.

A day out for me is unusual, but sometimes I have to go. Once, when Clive knew I had to have a scan at hospital, he said, 'You wouldn't tek some sheep to Arthur's field, would yer?' Being an idiot, I said yes. So there I was, trying to park a long-wheelbase Land Rover with a triple-axle trailer on the back and 45 sheep in it, in a hospital car park.

I did three circuits, couldn't find anywhere to put it, so pulled into an ambulance bay. I was sure I'd get clamped, but clearly everybody who saw it thought there must have been a terrible agricultural emergency. Why else would anyone park a trailer-load of bleating sheep in a hospital car park?

Nobody said it would be an easy life, but I love that we're filling Ravenseat with people. We have the children, we have guests staying in our shepherd's hut and walkers stopping for a break in the sunshine to eat the cream teas I offer in the summer.

During the shooting season we see parties come up through the farmyards and out on to the moor, a real cross-section of people from beaters to the well-heeled set: Elle Macpherson looking splendid in tweed, and one time even Prince Charles.

And then there are the James Herriot tourists - we once had a delightful Japanese couple intent on seeing a ewe giving birth. Luckily, one of the ewes showed signs that a lamb was imminent, and out came our visitors' video cameras.

Then the unusual noises began: agonised groans from the sheep coupled with an eye-popping strained expression. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable, but my visitors thought everything was normal and kept filming.

Alerted by the dreadful noise, my husband came rushing in. 'Just keep smilin',' he whispered. 'I 'aven't a clue what the problem is.' We knelt down and realised two lambs were coming at the same time, jammed like a cork in a bottle.

'Turn t'owd girl around, away from t'camera,' hissed Clive. 'We're not guaranteed to 'ave a happy ending.' But to a round of applause from our visitors, two healthy lambs were born and the couple said it was one of the most amazing things they'd seen.

For me, it was just one of the daily miracles in my unpredictable but endlessly rewarding life as a Yorkshire shepherdess. Even after all these years, I find myself catching my breath at the splendour of it all. I have a lot to thank James Herriot for.
