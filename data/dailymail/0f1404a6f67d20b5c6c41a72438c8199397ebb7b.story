A young teenager lost her life and her mother was hospitalized following an accident Saturday night.

Trinity Bachamann, 13, of Apopka, Florida, was struck dead as she sat in the street arguing with her mother, Janice Perdoza, about who would sit in the front seat of the car.

Perdoza, 36, was also injured in the accident and hospitalized, but has since been released.

The young girl's friends set up a memorial at the site (above) where Trinity was hit by a driver who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot'

Apopka police told WKMG that the pair were struck by a 21-year-old woman who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot.'

They also found an open bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her car.

Trinity, an eighth-grader at Apopka Middle School, was upset with her mother after she was refused a spot in the front seat while driving home from a friend's house.

Though three miles from home, the young girl got out of the car refusing to get back in, despite her mother's pleas.

She then sat down in the middle of the road, refusing to move. 

'We heard arguing going on and stepped outside,' said Jackie Suggs, who lives across the street from the scene of the accident. 

'Somebody said "get outta here," and next thing you know, bam! She got hit and flew up in the air. It was awful.'

The driver of the car, who did stop after the incident, was given a blood test on the scene.

Authorities are awaiting the results of that test before charging the woman, and said the accident is under investigation.

'She was lifeless, right there, just lifeless,' added Suggs. 

'And her mom was just panicking. Screaming.' 

The scene of the incident was dark (above) and the teenager was wearing dark clothing noted one passerby 

Pizza driver Michael Bryan, 25, said he also saw the girl sitting in the road, but not until the very last second.

'I couldn't see her clearly until I passed them,' he told the Orlando Sentinel, explaining the the road was poorly lit and the teen was wearing dark clothing at the time.

Thinking that the car had broken down, he returned back to scene after dropping off his next delivery, but by then it was too late.

Now, a Go Fund Me page has been set up for the family during this difficult time by Amy Shelly, who was one of Trinity's cheerleading coaches.

'A big personality, a huge heart,' is how Shelley described the popular young teenager.  

Friends of Trinity set up a memorial for the girl, who they remember as a 'firecracker' who loved to sing, at the scene of the accident, and grief counselors were made available at the middle school.
