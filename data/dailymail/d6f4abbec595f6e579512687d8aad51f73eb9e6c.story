Adnan Januzaj has found himself cut out of the action for club and country in recent times, so it was fitting that the young Belgian star treated himself to a trim from renowned hair stylist Calum Tierney.

Januzaj’s Belgium side were held to a 0-0 draw with Wales in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday with the 19-year-old sitting on the bench until the 89th minute.

Things have not been much better for Januzaj at Manchester United this season either. Since the arrival of Louis van Gaal, the youngster’s career has taken a turn for the worse.

Since the arrival of the likes of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, Falcao has started just four Premier League games this season.

Belgium have had an indifferent start to their campaign are currently fourth in the Group B table. Belgium face Cyprus at home n their next Euro 2016 on Saturday.

Januzaj will be hoping he makes the cut for that one.
