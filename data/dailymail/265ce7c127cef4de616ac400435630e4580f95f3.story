Just a couple of days after playing as an emergency striker against Crystal Palace, James Milner has proved his versatility as an actor by starring in Manchester City's latest Christmas video.

Inspired by the popular parody Twitter account @BoringMilner, which portrays the England midfielder as football's dullest player, the new clip sees the 28-year-old welcome kit man Les Chapman into his 'home' for Christmas.

Set in a meeting room at City's new Football Academy, Milner is filmed opening presents from his family - all of which are wrapped in plain brown paper as he 'doesn't like too much colour'.

Reading a book entitled 'Avoid Boring People' when he hears a knock on the door, Milner's other reading material includes literature on Greek sculpture and calorie counting.

But having sent a Christmas list to his family - all of whom share similar names - Milner is soon settling down alongside City's popular kit man Chappy to open his gifts.

First up is a box of PG Tips tea bags from his uncle James, although Yorkshireman Milner is left perplexed by the brand.

'Bit foreign isn't it?' he says. 'Thought it was only Yorkshire Tea that did tea bags. I've never heard of them.'

Milner then shows off a plain white Christmas card - with the words 'Merry Christmas' in black font on the front - from his former team-mate Gareth Barry.

'He's a good mate,' Milner says of the Everton midfielder. 'He's a hoot - we have some great text conversations. It's brilliant. Snow white.'

Next up is a set of dumpling moulds from Auntie Jay. 'That wasn't on my list but me and Auntie Jay had a detailed conversation a few weeks ago about dumplings and how it's so hard to get them spherical,' Milner explains.

Continuing to live up to the @BoringMilner account, which has over 360,000 followers, Milner shows off a mocked-up picture of him with the Queen and Prince Charles, declaring: 'It was an amazing day. As you can see everyone was having a whale of a time. It was one of the funniest days I've had.'

An eraser, pencil  and sharpener from his Auntie James then appear to make Milner's day as the former Leeds midfielder excitedly says: 'That's going to come in handy. They get a bit giddy with pink ones these days but you can't beat a white rubber. Pencil sharpener - marvellous.'

'Ooh, shall I try it out? It's going through nice and smooth - sometimes you can get those jittery ones. It's come out beautiful.'

But Milner is left confused when he opens five pairs of feel fresh socks from his auntie Milly, all of which are emblazoned with the days of the week.

'What about Saturday and Sunday?' he says. 'It does throw me off. I really enjoyed wearing them [last year].

'But when I was taking my washing up and down the stairs I dropped one and it wasn't clean in time. I had to wear one Tuesday and one Wednesday. It was a day we were travelling to Europe and I nearly fell down the stairs on to the plane because my right foot was moving quicker than my left. I might be running around in circles if I'm wearing different socks.'

Fortunately Milner's special day ended on a high when he received a new shovel from his Uncle Jimbo.

'Marvellous,' he says after unwrapping his final present. 'That is fantastic. I've been waiting for this one. 

'I didn't want to use last year's shovel - it doesn't feel right. I can't wait. It's a nine-inch one as well which isn't too big but you can use it with one hand. Perfect.'

The England man proves he has a kind heart too by handing over a gift to former City midfielder Chapman - a handheld steam cleaner.

'It's my old one but I've kept it pristine,' Milner adds. 'You'll have hours of fun with it.'
