Julia Jenkins isn't afraid of getting shots anymore. The 13-year-old became well acquainted with needles, after donating bone marrow twice to two of her sick brothers.

It all started in 2008 when doctors found a swollen lymph node on then 2-year-old brother Will's neck. At first he was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare cancer of the lymphatic system.

But doctors were confounded when exactly one year later older brother John, then 6, was diagnosed with the same form of cancer.

A sister's sacrifice: When she was in the second grade, Julia Jenkins donated bone marrow to two of her brothers who were suffering from a rare genetic disorder

Since Burkitt's doesn't run in families, doctors at Aflac Cancer Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta started looking for another diagnosis.

First signs: Brother Will was the first to get sick in 2008, and the then 2-year-old was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma

A specialist remembered hearing about a rare genetic immune disorder called XLP that causes the same symptoms. Will and John tested positive for the disease, in addition to their 2-year-old brother Matthew.

Mother Christy Jenkins was told that all three of her sons might need a bone marrow transplant just to survive.

That's when big sister Julia stepped up to the plate and got tested to see if she was a match for the donation.

'I remember getting my blood tested, like sticking a needle in my arm,' Julia told My Fox Atlanta.

Turns
 out, she was a perfect match for both John and Matthew. At the time, 
she was too young to really understand what donating bone marrow would 
entail, but she didn't think twice about doing it.

'I said yes, because they're my brothers,' she said.

So
 when she was just in the second grade, doctors at Cincinnati Children's
 Hospital put her to sleep and gathered bone marrow from her hip bone to
 give to her little brothers.

The
 first time Matthew's body resisted her cells so a year later she did 
the same thing again, this time sitting still for eight hours while stem 
cells were filtered out of her blood.

Second diagnosis: But when another brother got sick, doctors discovered that all three of the boys had XLP - a rare genetic disorder

Second time's a charm: Julia had her blood tested and found she was a perfect donor for John and Matthew. Matthew's immune system resisted her first donation so she donated again

Three
 years later, all three of her brothers are healthy (a woman in Texas 
donated for Will). They receive weekly injections to boost their b-cell 
count but other than that, they're strong enough to rough house with 
each other.

Julia
 says if she had to do it again, she would and now she wouldn't be 
scared because seeing her brothers healthy is more important trumps any 
fear of needles.

'It's like a good feeling, because they're alive because of you,' Julia said.Â 

More important things: After her two donations, now 13-year-old Julia (right) says she isn't afraid of needles anymore

Life saver: Today, all three of her brothers are healthy and only need weekly immune boosts to stay that way
