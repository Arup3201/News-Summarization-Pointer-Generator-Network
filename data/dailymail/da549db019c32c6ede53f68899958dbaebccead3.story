Georgy Trefilov was arrested at Gatwick Airport

A Russian mulit-millionaire worth £450m has been arrested at Gatwick Airport after allegedly flying into the UK using a fake passport.

Moscow businessman Georgy Trefilov, the 79th richest man in Russia, was arrested by Border Force officers after touching down at the airport on Tuesday afternoon this week.

It is believed he was trying to use a counterfeit Greek passport to enter the UK.

The 41-year-old founder and president of Marta Holdings - which owns a string of more than 300 stores in Russia including Grossmart, Billa and Pur Pur - was charged with possession of false identify document at Crawley Magistrates on Wednesday.

JPs remanded Trefilov in custody until April 5, when he will appear before Lewes Crown Court.

A Border Force spokesman said today: 'On the afternoon of Tuesday March 19, 41-year-old Russian national Georgy Trefilov was arrested by Border Force officers at Gatwick North Terminal on suspicion of having attempted to use a counterfeit Greek passport to enter the UK.

'Mr Trefilov was later charged with possessing a false identity document and appeared before Crawley magistrates the following day, where he was remanded in custody.'
