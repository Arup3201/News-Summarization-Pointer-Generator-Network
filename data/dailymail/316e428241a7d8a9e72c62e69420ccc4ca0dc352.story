'Loves to dance': Ryan Brown was performing his job as a sign spinner when he was arrested

Police have arrested a man working as a sign spinner in Florida for distracting drivers.

Ryan Brown, 22, was holding a sign for Cornerstone Tiles and Flooring in West Palm Beach and dancing when a deputy arrested him at 12:35pm Tuesday.

According to the arrest report, a driver flagged down the deputy to complain that Brown's enthusiasm in performing his job was distracting.

The Brooklyn, New York native 
allegedly stepped off the median strip and danced on Okeechobee 
Boulevard with headphones on while holding his sign.

According
 to the Sun Sentinel, the deputy drove to the intersection at 
Okeechobee, Wabasso Drive and Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard and encountered
 Brown.

'I explained to
 him why I had made contact with him and he started yelling at me 
telling me he is a working man not allowing me to tell him why I had 
checked out with him,' the deputy's report stated.

Brown
 cursed at the deputy and reportedly tried to reach into his pocket. The
 deputy told him not to but Brown allegedly refused. The deputy arrested
 Brown on misdemeanor charges of failure to obey police, unlawful use of
 a state right of way and resisting arrest without violence.

He was booked into Palm Beach County Jail around 1pm and released four hours later.

Brown's boss says the arrest was 'not fair.'

'He loves to dance, and some people like it and some don't,' said Hector Peart, who owns Cornerstone Tile and Flooring, Inc told the Sun Sentinel.

Peart has no intention of letting his employee go after the incident.

'He will be back to hold the sign,' Peart told the Sun Sentinel. 'He will just have to do it a little differently.'
