A carjacker has been caught on camera stealing a woman's Mini and dragging the owner 30ft along the road before abandoning her in the street.

Nikki Law-Priddey left the car engine running and the door open as she de-iced the vehicle sitting on her driveway in Birmingham on a freezing morning last week.

Just moments later, a man in a baseball cap sprinted towards the £16,000 Mini Cooper and jumped into the driver's seat. 

Theft: A carjacker was caught on CCTV running over to Nikki Law-Priddey's car on her driveway

Taken: He jumped into the driver's seat of the Mini Cooper, which had its door open and engine running

Reaction: Mrs Law-Priddey ran back to her vehicle and tried to force the carjacker to get out

Mrs Law-Priddey, 30, tried to drag him out of the car, but he managed to drive off as she desperately hung on to the door.

Eventually the business developer was forced to let go, and the thief got away leaving her lying injured in the street with a broken hand and bruising.

Her pet dog Pippin - a Bichon Frise - ran after her, and woke her up by licking her face.

The whole incident, which took place in the Bartley Green suburb of Birmingham last Thursday, was caught on a CCTV camera fixed to Mrs Law-Priddey's house.

Police were able to retrieve the Mini, which the thief had apparently planned to sell on using false number plates, and have arrested a man on suspicion of robbery.

Escape: The thief drove away from the house, dragging the car's owner along behind him

Callous: The carjacker drove 30ft into the public road as Mrs Law-Priddey desperately tried to cling on

Injured: Mrs Law-Priddey, circled in this image, was left with a broken hand and bruised back and legs

Anger: The carjacking victim, pictured, posted footage of her ordeal on Facebook

Mrs Law-Priddey, who is married and has a six-year-old daughter, posted video footage of the carjacking on her Facebook page in a bid to find the 'scum' responsible - and urged other drivers to be careful about leaving their engines running.

'These past 24 hours have been the worst time of my life, to say I am in total shock and disbelief to what has happened to me on my own doorstep in broad day light is a understatement,' she wrote.

'Carjacking is on the rise. Do not leave your car running to de-ice it, scum like this wait for people just like me to make this mistake. When you get in the car lock the doors and stay safe.

'Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me especially in broad daylight on my own drive.'

She added: 'My car has been recovered by the police and is in forensics.

'I know these scumbags talk and he would have tried to sell this car, when it was found false plates were on it.'

Speaking after the ordeal, Mrs Law-Priddey said: 'The car wasn't insured because I was selling it that day and that's what I was panicking about. I think if it was insured I'd probably have been like, "Just take the car."

'But I'm quite a feisty person, it was just my natural instinct to jump in on top of him. I kept saying to him, "You're going to kill me, you're going to kill me," and he's like, "Just let go of the car."'

Her sister Becky said Mrs Law-Priddey had been left traumatised by the carjacking, and is fortunate to be alive.

Car: The Mini has been retrieved and a man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery

Home: Mrs Law-Priddey had a CCTV camera attached to her house allowing her to capture video footage

Damage: Mrs Law-Priddey with her jumper which was ruined during the ordeal

Ruined: Her shoes were also damaged while the jeans she was wearing were completely ripped apart

'She was dragged under the car and out in the road by this person,' she said. 'She is very lucky that she was not even more seriously injured, or killed.

'We have been circulating pictures of the car in the hope that the person who took it can be found.

'After seeing footage of her being dragged along the ground under the wheels of her car I can't believe she's actually alive.'

West Midlands Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of robbery yesterday over the incident yesterday and he had been bailed while investigations continue.

Detective Constable Stuart Parker added: 'We're doing all we can to find whoever was responsible and as well as arresting one man in connection with the robbery, we're also carrying out a forensic examination of the vehicle.

'This happened in broad daylight and we would urge anyone who witnessed anything which might be relevant to our investigation to contact us.'

He added: 'We'd also like to remind people there are always opportunistic thieves around looking for an easy steal, and not to leave cars unlocked and unattended, with the keys in the ignition.'

Mrs Law-Priddey has urged anyone with information to call police on 101 or ring Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
