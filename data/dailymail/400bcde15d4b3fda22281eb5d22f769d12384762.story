Chris Eubank Jnr is considering heading to America to prepare for his next fight in the belief that sparring partners are running scared after watching him go toe-to-toe with WBA and IBF super middleweight champion Carl Froch.

The middleweight faces Russia’s Dmitry Chudinov for the WBA interim middleweight title, on the undercard of Tyson Fury versus Christian Hammer, at London’s 02 Arena on February 28.

The fight will be Eubank’s first since suffering his first defeat to Billy Joe Saunders last November.

Eubank says sparring partners have been scared off after watching the footage

He maintains he should have got the decision over the British, Commonwealth and European champion, but that his preparations for that fight had been undermined by a difficulty sourcing sparring partners since the emergence of video footage of him sparring with Froch before his rematch with George Groves at Wembley last May.

‘Since I sparred with Froch and the footage went online, it’s been hell to get any type of sparring partner,’ said Eubank.

‘They’ve seen me perform against a world-level fighter, standing toe-to-toe, not backing down – and he’s a super middleweight, I’m a middleweight.

‘Fighters have seen that and thought “Maybe I should find somebody else to work with”.

‘If I find myself in a situation like my last fight where sparring partners are scarce, then I will go over to the States, because sparring is number one.

‘If I don’t have what I need then I will have to go.’

Eubank lost a split decision to Saunders in a fight that divided opinion but promoter Frank Warren plans to stage a rematch between them in the summer.

‘I’m not using (a lack of sparring) as an excuse for the fact I didn’t come away with the decision, because I feel like I performed better than Saunders did in the fight,' he said.

Eubank will bid to bounce back from defeat to Billy Joe Saunders against Dmitry Chudinov in February

‘With Carl (Froch), I travelled up to Sheffield, a four-and-a-half hour drive. I’d made the trip because I wanted to test myself.

‘Unfortunately I guess not everyone in the business has that mindset. Some guys want easy sparring, they don’t want their confidence knocked at all.

‘A lot of the time, because they don’t want to spar, the only way for me to spar is to travel across England to different gyms, in different cities and towns. That way they’ll do it, they feel more at home in their gyms.’

Fury v Hammer and Eubank v Chudinov is live on BoxNation on February 28.
