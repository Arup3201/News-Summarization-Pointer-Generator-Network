 A slimmer who vowed to lose weight after suffering the humiliation of needing a seat-belt extension on a plane has shed a sensational 10st.

Mother-of-two Aimee Diri was travelling to Portugal in July 2012 when she discovered, at 20st 2lb, she was too big to strap in.

The embarrassing episode kick-started Aimee's dramatic weight loss, which saw her shed half her body weight.

Now the 36-year-old is a svelte 10st, and has been named Slimmer of the year at her local Slimming World group.

'I vowed to myself that I would never go on holiday again that size,' said Aimee from Northfield, Birmingham. 'I was really embarrassed. It felt horrible.

'It was the first time I felt self-conscious. When we arrived I didn't want to be around the pool, and I couldn't get in the fairground rides with the kids.

'It was definitely the trigger.'

Six months later Aimee and husband Manuel booked their summer holiday and, determined to lose weight, Aimee signed up to Slimming World in January 2013 a size 26.

'I wanted to lose six stone by the time I went on holiday in the July,' she said.

'There was no way I was going away again feeling so bad.'

Waitress Aimee would soon have to change her eating habits. A constant grazer, she admits she would skip dinner and instead snack on crisps, biscuits, chocolate and other junk all evening.

Aimee admits her diet was excessive - involving snacking on junk foods in secret and often skipping meals 

'I look back and cringe at what I used to eat.

'I was a secret eater really, and used to eat a lot when I had put the kids to bed and was on my own.'

Aimee, mother to Isabella, six and Luca, three, joined her local group run by Paula Hooper at the Quarry Sports and Social Club. 

She started on a new healthy eating plan, ditching the naughty snacks and switching to home-cooked meals and lots of fruits and vegetables.

The super-slimmer lost her target 6st for her summer holiday, and set her sights on losing even more.

And this summer Aimee finally reached her goal of 10st, and even felt confident enough to wear a bikini on holiday.

Aimee has totally transformed her diet to lose the pounds, eating healthy home-cooked meals 

'I have lost a whole one of me - it's crazy,' said Aimee. 'When I look back at my old self, I wish that someone had told me.

'It's all about the confidence- that is what Slimming World gives you the confidence and the support to know you can do it.'

Paula Hooper, who runs the Northfield group, says: 'I'm so proud of Aimee, Not only does she look fabulous, she's improved her health and is bursting with energy.

'She's a huge inspiration to everyone in our group and I hope she inspires other women in Northfield to change their lives in the same way.'
