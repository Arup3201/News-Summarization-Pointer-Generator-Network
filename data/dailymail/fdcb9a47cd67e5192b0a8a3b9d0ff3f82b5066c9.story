Hi guys! It’s officially festival season – I had some serious Glasto envy earlier this year and have made a vow to register for tickets for next year.

I did manage to catch some of the coverage on TV though, and as well as watching all the awesome bands I loved looking at all the crazy outfits and make-up worn by festival goers.

Festivals are a time when you can really go crazy with your make-up. Glitter, UV paint, crazy colours in your hair – anything goes!

This week Binky Felstead uses glitter, UV paint and neon colours to create the perfect festival look

This week, I’ve enlisted the help of top make-up artist Daniel Sandler. Daniel’s taken inspiration from make-up seen on Pixie Lott and Vanessa Hudgens to create my floral festival-themed face.

This happy-go-lucky hippy style look will take you from day to night whether you’ll be rocking out at Reading or raving it up in Creamfields.

How To Create A Floral Festival Makeup Look

Step 2 – Powder in PlaceTo set my base, Daniel rubbed his Invisible Veil Powder into his hands and applied it to my face with his fingers. This powder gives a real airbrushed, flawless finish to the face without looking or feeling caked on, and sets make-up perfectly so you don’t have to worry about it sweating off in the heat.

For the Earth Mother style floral face pattern, Daniel grabbed his Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Green Velvet and began drawing a floral stem design to the side of one of my eyes

Step 3 – Shimmering ShadowNext, Daniel moved onto defining my eyes, using the Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palettes in Rosewood and Violet. He applied some of the pearly pink shade from the Rosewood palette all over my lids to give them a subtle iridescent glow, followed by the lilac colour from the Violet palette just below the outer corners of my eyes. This created a pretty, shimmering effect – we didn’t want anything too heavy. Finally, he dabbed some of the bright white shade from the Violet palette to the inner corners of my eyes to make them pop, as well as stroking some under the eyebrow to highlight the brow bone.Step 4 – Funky FlowersNow for the fun part! For the Earth Mother style floral face pattern, Daniel grabbed his Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Green Velvet and began drawing a floral stem design to the side of one of my eyes. He then dabbed a small brush into a melted down version of his Luxury Matte Lipstick in Gigi and used this to draw on some flower petals. For the centres of the flowers, he used the shimmering golden shade from his Eyeshadow Quad in Beyond Sunset. You don’t have to be too neat when painting on a design like this – just be spontaneous and let your creativity flow! Festivals are all about having fun and you can get away with much more daring looks than you can on a day-to-day basis, so feel free to go as crazy as you like with colours and patterns.

Step 5 – Crazy EyelashesThese gorgeous Paperself False Eyelashes are ideal for a festival when you’re entitled to go a little mad with your look, and their intricate floral design perfectly complements the flower pattern Daniel drew onto my face earlier. He snipped a portion off the false lashes and ran eyelash glue along their edge. He then waited until the glue was tacky before carefully applying them across my upper lash line. Applying false eyelashes can be a bit tricky, so practise in your room at home before doing it in your tent!

Step 6 – Two-Tone LipFor a vibrant night-time look, Daniel created this amazing two-tone lip. He patted his Luxury Matte Lipstick in the bright fuschia shade Gigi onto my upper lip with his fingers, then did the same on my lower lip using the same lipstick in blood-orange shade Marilyn. I then gently pressed my lips together to slightly blend the colours for a smudged effect.Festivals can get very messy as I’m sure you all know, so I recommend taking some Handy Hygienic Wipes from Halo with you to freshen up as you go along.

Their Eye Make-Up Remover Wipes work a treat for removing all the crazy make-up from your face when the party’s over, and they also offer Moist Toilet Tissue wipes – the ultimate festival essential!

Hope you guys like this look! Drop me a comment and let me know what you think. Are you off to any festivals this year? Let’s keep our fingers crossed the sun stays out…Until next time,Binky xxx
