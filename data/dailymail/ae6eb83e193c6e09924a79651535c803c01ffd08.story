Pumped-up Education Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning angrily rejected claims Michael Gove was still meddling in schools policy – insisting: 'I'm in charge.'

Mrs Morgan dismissed as 'complete nonsense' revelations that her predecessor is receiving confidential documents from her department despite being sacked six months ago.

The Cabinet minister, a former high-powered lawyer, added she had previously seen off men trying to tell her what to do – by rejecting her vicar's attempt  to get her to 'obey' her husband when she got married.

Mrs Morgan said the vicar had 'lost that battle', adding: 'I didn't use those words.'

The Education Secretary, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, also suggested she had won a behind-the-scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan this morning angrily rejected claims Michael Gove was still meddling in schools policy – insisting: 'I'm in charge'

Ms Morgan said she was 'absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected'.

But the Tory minister made clear that the ringfence would apply to education for five to 16-year-olds but did not commit to similar protections for early years or further education.

Her comments came as Prime Minister David Cameron was applying the finishing touches to a speech that is expected to further outline the Tories' education plans tomorrow.

Part of the plan will be for all pupils to pass tough new exams before leaving primary school as part of a 'war on illiteracy and innumeracy'.

As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use 'accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar'.

By the time they leave primary school all 11 year-olds will know their times tables, be able to read a novel, and be able to write a short story under the plans.

Despite announcing the new policy today, Mrs Morgan was forced to fend off claims that her predecessor as Education Secretary was acting as a backseat driver from his position as Chief Whip.

Ms Morgan said: 'I think this is a complete load of nonsense. Michael has been nothing but supportive as have other former education secretaries.

'I am very much in charge of the Department for Education and we are all as Conservative colleagues united in what we want to see.'

The Education Secretary, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, also suggested she had won a behind-the-scenes battle with the military against further cuts to the schools budget

The Royal Marines could be merged with the army’s elite airborne brigade and taken out of the Navy, under plans being considered to cope with a new round of military cuts.

Government officials are looking at a proposal to create a joint airborne and amphibious force, which would see the marines put under the control of the army, according to the Sunday Times.

The radical proposal is being drawn up as senior military figures brace themselves for further swingeing defence cuts, amid signs the Department for Education has won the battle for funding with the Ministry of Defence.

David Cameron and Ed Miliband have refused to ring-fence defence spending – with experts warning this could mean further cuts to the defence budget of up to 26 per cent after 2015/16.

Mrs Morgan said more needed to be done to promote 'British values' in schools.

She said headteachers needed to promote 'democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, and… respect for people of other faiths and other beliefs'.

But she admitted that values changed as time went on, adding: 'I remember having a debate with the vicar before I got married about whether I was going to obey my husband.

'My husband said 'have a go, I think you're going to lose that battle' – and he did, and I didn't use those words.

'That's why things do change and I think those are the core values and I think it is important that all our schools are promoting them. As I say, the best schools are doing this already.'

But Mrs Morgan said it was an 'outrage' that under the last government 'one in three people were leaving primary school unable to read or write properly'.

She said the new reading and writing targets for primary school were 'what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system'.

Mrs Morgan added: 'As I say, we have to be ambitious for our young people: If we don't get it right in primary it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they're in secondary schools.'

Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Conservatives are returned to power, she indicated.

'We have to be ambitious for our young people, if we don't get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools,' she said.

Ms Morgan hopes the tests will help England to the top of the class in European league tables for English and maths by 2020, as well as in the top five internationally - a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt claimed the Government's schools policy was allowing more unqualified teachers into classrooms which was damaging England's international position in education.

The Labour frontbencher said: 'David Cameron's flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest.

'Many parents will be shocked to learn that David Cameron's government has changed the rules to allow unqualified teachers into the classroom on a permanent basis, leading to a 16% rise in the last year alone.'

He added: 'The surest way to raise standards in every lesson, in every school, is to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom.

'That begins with an end to Cameron's unqualified teachers policy.

Labour will ensure that all teachers are qualified and continue to train to improve their teaching as a condition to remaining in the classroom.

'This is how we improve the learning and life chances for all children and raise our international position in reading, writing and maths.' 

A spokesman for Michael Gove said the claim, reported in the Independent on Sunday, that he was meddling in education policy was untrue.

The spokesman said: 'This is total nonsense, as usual. I'm surprised a paper which employs the brilliant John Rentoul would print rubbish like this.'

A Cabinet Office spokesman added: 'The Independent on Sunday's story is totally untrue. The Chief Whip's office has not received, handled or put into the red box any of the Education Secretary's paperwork.'
