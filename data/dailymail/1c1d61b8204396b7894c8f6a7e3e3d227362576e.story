Loyal British Telecom customers face inflation-busting price rises because of the firm’s £1.6billion splurge on football rights, campaigners claimed last night.

Line rental, call charges and broadband bills are to jump by at least 6 per cent from December.

Charities say the elderly, many of whom regard their home phones as a lifeline, will be the hardest hit.

BT paid £897million in November for a three-year Champions League broadcasting deal, which starts next year.

It was already paying £738million for Premier League games in an attempt to break Sky’s dominance of televised top-flight football.

Lisa Harris, of the over-50s group Saga, said: ‘As BT announces multi-million pound football rights deals, it will be difficult for those already struggling to make ends meet to understand why they are subject to above inflation price increases.

‘For many older people the telephone and internet is their lifeline.

‘Increasing prices way in excess of inflation risks more older people becoming socially isolated for fear of using their phone or internet to keep in touch with friends and family members. 

'Older consumers have already seen their cost of living rise significantly faster than the population as a whole since 2007, and this adds further pressure to their already stretched budgets.’ 

Around ten million BT customers will be affected by the changes to line rental charges.

These include seven million broadband customers, who automatically have line rental as part of their package.

Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said: ‘Even a small increase in phone and broadband bills could have a big impact on family finances.

‘In the past 12 months, Citizens Advice has dealt with more than 62,000 telephone and broadband debt problems. 

'Many standard television, broadband and phone packages come as bundles which can make it hard for consumers to spot price rises.’

BT denied that it had raised prices in order to cover the cost of its investment in sports rights.

A spokesman said: ‘Our price changes are not associated with BT Sport.

'We make major investments in equipment, services and technology all the time – and we’ve invested more in superfast broadband than sports rights.’ 

BT said its rivals – including TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Sky – had also increased their charges. It launched BT Sport – a package of pay-for television channels – to much fanfare last August.

Viewing figures were initially disappointing with some shows being watched by just 1,200 viewers.

But last month BT claimed its Premier League offering was paying off with broadband and TV revenues up by a quarter. 

The telecoms giant said it had added a net 104,000 broadband customers in the three months to the end of June, beating Sky. 

In December, the price of standard line rental for direct debit customers will rise by £1 to £16.99.

The pence per minute rate for calls to UK landlines and 0870 numbers will go up from 9p a minute to 9.58p.

The set-up fee for landline calls, which is charged as soon as the call is connected, will increase from 15p to 15.97p and call return will increase from 19.9p to 21.19p.

Broadband prices are going up by as much as 6.5 per cent.
