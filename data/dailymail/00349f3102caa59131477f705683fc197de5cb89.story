Kim Kardashian yesterday revealed that her 16-month-old daughter with Kanye West will have to pay her own way in life - just like she did.

And it seems that the reality TV star and entrepreneur is setting a good example for little North.

On top of filming for her hit show, designing her clothing range for Lipsy, creating her debut haircare range and penning her soon-to-launch coffee table book, the businesswoman has unveiled her seventh fragrance.

Entrepreneur: There's just no stopping businesswoman Kim Kardashian, who has released her seventh fragrance. This one, called Fleur Fatale, aims to reflect her love of roses 

The new scent, called Fleur Fatale, is described as a 'beautifully floral and elegant scent'.

'With Kim's life continuing to blossom into the next chapter, it's time to plant a new seed with a seventh scent to add to her growing portfolio of successful fragrances,' reads the release.

The £24 ($38) fragrance apparently takes a different turn from her past fragrances and opens with fresh and crisp notes of blackcurrant, bergamot and violet.

It's also packed with floral notes such as iris and peony combined with white musk and sandalwood.

Sweet smell of success: The fragrance apparently takes a different turn from her past fragrances and opens with fresh and crisp notes of blackcurrant, bergamot and violet and ranges in price between £24 ($38) for a 30ml bottle and £40 ($64) for 100ml

The bottle has been designed with Kim's love of flowers, particularly roses, in mind.

The bottle comes with a high gloss finish, accented with touches of rose gold - only the best for Kim.

Describing the perfume's creator, the release adds: 'There is something dangerously alluring about Kim, a magnetic energy that lures people into her world. Fleur Fatale is the unavoidable temptation.'

It's been a busy few weeks for Kim, who is preparing to launch her new line with her sisters for Lipsy next week.

But luckily for the workaholic, her beau Kanye organised a birthday surprise for her - a romantic trip to Hawaii.

The 37-year-old rapper whisked the reality star off to Maui to ring in her 34th year together.

Of course, Kim couldn't resist sharing a scenic holiday snap with her Twitter followers along with the caption: 'Good morning #BdaySurpriseGettaway.'

While she didn't disclose the location, Popdust reports the couple were spotted having breakfast together at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea.
