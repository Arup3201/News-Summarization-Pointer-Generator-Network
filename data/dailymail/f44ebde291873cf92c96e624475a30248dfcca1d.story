Suspect: David Hedrick has been arrested in connection with an unsolved murder from 1991

A man has been arrested for murder after his DNA was linked to a bloody crime scene - 21 years after the event.

David Hedrick ran into trouble with police after evading tax on a deal to sell televisions to Disney World.

Authorities took a routine genetic sample from him, and matched it to DNA found at the scene of Betty Clair Foster's 1991 murder.

Hedrick, 50, is now being held without bail on suspicion of killing Ms Foster and escaping justice for the next two decades.

Ms Foster, then 50, was working alone at a computer store near Casselberry, Florida on January 31 1991 when she was killed.

A customer arrived at the shop in mid-afternoon and found Ms Foster dead inside the blood-spattered premises.

She was found to have been stabbed several times in the neck and chest.

No money had been taken from the tills or the victim's purse, and police were unable to find a motive for the killing.

Although Ms Foster's father offered $5,000 for information helping the investigation, police found no new leads and stopped actively pursuing the case.

However, they did find DNA belonging to someone other than the victim in blood left on the walls of the store.

In 2007, meanwhile Hedrick sold $764,000 worth of televisions to the owner of two hotels in Walt Disney World.

He charged $72,000 in sales tax, but failed to pass on that money to the authorities. In November he was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 15 years' probation.

As a convicted felon, he had to provide his DNA to the police - and when they ran it through a database, it matched the samples taken from the scene of Ms Foster's death.

'Without that arrest and conviction two months ago, we would have never been able to identify Mr Hedrick,' a Seminole County policeman told local radio station WDBO.

Hedrick is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday.
