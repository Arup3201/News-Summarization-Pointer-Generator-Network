A Delaware lawyer has declared he is willing to starve himself to death in front of the Supreme Court unless he gets national recognition for his campaign to stop employers firing staff because of embarrassing or controversial social media posts.

Brian Zulberti, 31, who is on the fifth day of his hunger strike in Washington D.C., is currently camped out in front of the court sitting on a sun lounger with an umbrella to protect himself from the sun.

The Villanova law school graduate wants a 90 second slot on a national television news network to gain exposure for his fight to legally separate the personal and professional lives of US citizens - and he claims he is willing to die on the sidewalk of the capitol if he doesn't get it.

Protest: Brian Zulberti outside the US Supreme Court in May - where he is currently conducting a hunger strike that will not cease unless he gains 90 seconds of national television news coverage

Zulberti, who achieved a level of notoriety last year for circulating emails to hundreds of law firms with a photo of himself in a t-shirt showing off his biceps in an effort to get a job, is no stranger to social media fouls.

He followed that up by posting a Facebook photo of himself shirtless while holding up a sign that read 'Hire Me! No…as a lawyer, damn, not an escort…wait is it something I’m wearing?'

He has said he was also fired as a high-school tennis coach for comments he made online about an opposing player and when media checked his open Facebook profile after his unusual attempt to get hired last year they found several near-naked photographs.

However, Zulberti does not think any of this should interfere with his or anyone else's career.

'We have Americans being fired everyday from coast to coast in almost every single state for simply doing completely legal things like having a beer after work or expressing an opinion that just doesn't happen to fly with the boss,' said Zuberti to WUSA9.com

Zulberti, wants laws that legally prevent any employers from firing their staff for social media content or opinions.

'I believe that every single American has the right to be off the clock,' said Zulberti, who graduated with a degree in social media law, to WUSA9.com

'I don't believe that anyone should feel that they live in a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job interview.

'I don't believe that anyone should be told that they're the face of a company at 4 a.m. on a dance floor,' said Zulberti.'

Zulberti is carrying a sign that has a tally of how many days into his hunger strike he is and is constantly updating his Facebook page as to his protest's progress.

'Hunger Strike Update- 12:48 AM (3 days, 4 hours, and 49 minutes into my Hunger Strike)' wrote Zulberti.

'This really has been a hellish evening. My sign was ruined by the rain. I'm huddled under this umbrella making it very difficult to work.

'Water keeps getting on my Macbook and creeping close to the generators. And I'm exhausted. Someone shoot me.'

Earlier on Wednesday night, Zulberti admitted the smell of his clothes after three days without changing had become too much and said he was going to change - but not to eat.

Fiery: Brian Zulberti's Facebook profile page is filled with humorous pictures he has photo-shopped his half-naked picture onto

Discrimination: The law graduate wants the Supreme Court to prohibit employers from firing staff for ill-judged social media posts

'I want to be very clear about this. I am leaving the Supreme Court for a bout 60-90 minutes to go back to the Hotel Helix and take a shower and shave and change my clothes,' posted Zulberti to Facebook.

'Honestly, I know it's disgusting but I'm starting to smell after three entire days in the sweltering heat and no shower.

'And I want to brush my teeth. My teeth feel nasty. I don't like being unclean and its embarrassing when people take pictures with me and I stink.'

Claiming that America is sleeping walking into an Orwellian dystopia unless it faces facts on social media, Zulberti says he has more public support than has been acknowledged.

'A dirty little secret is that the majority of America doesn't see me as an outsider or a wierdo, but as a man willing to speak truth directly in the face of a foolhardy status quo,' wrote Zulberti to his Facebook page on Wednesday.

His mantra is 'Coverage or Death' and Zulberti admits that his particular method of drawing attention to this issue will split opinion among the media.

'I'm not going to lie. It feels good to draw publicity to a cause I've been fighting for and dedicating my life to,' wrote Zulberti on Tuesday.

'But I admit to also taking sick personal satisfaction in getting the coverage I knew I'd get... directly in the face of so many people who said no one would care about me or my message.'

Zulberti, who lists himself as self-employed at his own blog www.brianzulberti.net has been traveling the country to raise awareness of those fired because of their social media updates or postings.

Hammer blow: Zulberti has declared he will not stop his hunger strike unless he gets the exposure he wants

He was recently in New Jersey to discuss the case of Sam Falcetano, who worked for the Department of Public Works and was fired for writing homophobic posts.

Zulberti, who told The Washington Post he is 'about as gay as the day is long', said he disagrees with the man, but does not think he should have been fired.

Indeed, Zulberti is adamant his message will be heard.

Dismissing an interview with The Washington Post as not high-profile enough, Zulberti said he wants national television exposure. Only that will stop him from continuing his hunger strike.

'I want a major TV network,' he told The Washington Post.

'I want 90 second spot on a major network during prime time. Yes, if you were from CNN and you said Anderson Cooper will air you tonight, I would pack up my signs and leave. Mission accomplished.'
