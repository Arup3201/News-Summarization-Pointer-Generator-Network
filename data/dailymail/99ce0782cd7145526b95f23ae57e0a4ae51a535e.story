'So lucky': Princess Eugenie, seen here at Royal Ascot, has earned a 2:1 in English literature and history of art from Newcastle University

Princess Eugenie is to join the queue of job-hunting graduates after being awarded a degree by Newcastle University.

The Duke of York's younger daughter, who is sixth in line to the throne, earned a 2:1 in her combined English Literature and History of Art BA Honours, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday.

The 22-year-old royal described her time in the North East as a 'fantastic experience' and her parents declared they were 'immensely proud' of her.

Senior royal sources exclusively told the Mail tonight that she planned to get a job rather than become a full time royal and hoped to work 'in the art world'.

'Art is her love and she plans to look around and get as much experience in different fields before deciding which route to go down,' said one.

'She already has people keen to speak to her not least because of her results, which were very good indeed.'

Eugenie achieved a First in her final year dissertation in history of art.

The former Marlborough College student also has three good A levels under her belt - an A in each of English and art and a B in history of art.

Eugenie's elder sister, Princess Beatrice, graduated from Goldsmiths in London last year also with a 2:1 in History and History of Ideas -  making them the brainiest siblings in the royal family.

The Mail understands that Beatrice - who has battled dyslexia since she was a child - has also finally found a job herself a year after graduating.

She is currently studying for her financial services exams and will start work at an as yet unnamed company in the industry in September.

In a short statement Eugenie, who 'slummed' it in typical student digs while she was studying, said: 'Newcastle University has given me such an incredible three years. I have had a wonderful time in the North East, learning and having a fantastic experience.

'The staff and tutors at Newcastle have guided me through my years there and given me great support. I am so lucky to have spent time there.

'I wish all the students graduating this year the very best of luck in the future.'

Her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, who remain close after their divorce, issued a joint statement saying: 'Eugenie has worked incredibly hard to achieve this excellent result and we are immensely proud of what she has done, particularly gaining a first in her dissertation.

'She has had a wonderful time at Newcastle University and has greatly enjoyed her time in the North East.'

 Asked about Eugenie's plans for the future a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'She's considering her options like many graduates at the moment.'

Newcastle has long been popular with students from top public schools and the leafy suburb of Jesmond has been seen as an enclave for the young well-to-do.

Former students include actor and comedian Rowan Atkinson, singer Bryan Ferry and journalist Kate

As well as being a top-class student, Eugenie also has something of a reputation for partying.

In recent weeks she has frequently been seen out on the town with her cousin, Prince Harry.

At Marlborough she was said to be among a group of students seen celebrating the end of their exams by streaking through the grounds.

She was also reported to have visited a lap dancing club in London with a group of friends when she was just 18.

Controversially, she and her sister still receive round the clock police protection at an estimated cost of more than half a million pounds a year despite not being full-time working royals.
