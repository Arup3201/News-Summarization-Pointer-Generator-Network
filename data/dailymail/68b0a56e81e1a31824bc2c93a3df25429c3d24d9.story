Giants, devils and incredible human towers are the calling cards of the Barcelona's Festes de la Merce, or Festival of the Virgin of Mercy, the colourful annual event taking place now in the Catalan capital. 

Held in the name of the city's patron saint, who apparently conquered a plague of locusts in 1637, La Merce is a combination of some 600 events throughout the city. 

Adults and children in Dancing Devil costumes (Correfocs) are ever-present, armed with fireworks and crackers, while 'fire beasts' - more elaborately costumed participants or creations - shoot pyrotechnics at the gathered throng.

The daredevil art of the Castellers is world renowned as they build remarkable human towers possible in the Placa de Jaume. Thousands pack into the square as the groups, distinguished by colour, skillfully rise into the air before a child climbs to the top at the end.

The Giants of Santa Maria del Mar, massive papier-mache effigies of kings, queens and nobles, can also be seen dancing on the stage in front of the Town Hall or in the streets as part of their own parade.

The festival has run in some form since 1871, becoming more of a general Catalan celebration from 1902 onwards one local government official recognised its potential. Catalan dances, music from the region and around the world, and a range of other activities take place  to bring their huge community together and make this one of the world's great festivals.  

La Merce runs until September 24.
