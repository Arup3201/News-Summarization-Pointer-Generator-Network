Manchester United and Chelsea are ready to go head-to-head in a summer battle to sign £54million striker Edinson Cavani.

The Uruguayan’s representatives were in London as they consider a move away from Paris Saint-Germain, where Cavani has become unsettled.

The 26-year-old has been a success in
 France but is uncomfortable playing in a wide role to accommodate 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the central striker.

Big hit: Cavani has been a success since joining PSG from Serie A outfit Napoli in a £54m transfer

United manager David Moyes has Cavani on his shortlist but knows he will face competition from Jose Mourinho at Chelsea.

Both
 clubs want to bolster their strikeforce in the summer with Atletico 
Madrid’s Diego Costa and Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic also figuring 
prominently in their thinking.

United sounded out PSG last month but were
 told they would not sell Cavani in January.

Now
 Cavani’s camp are ready to hold preliminary discussions with would-be 
suitors about what financial figures would be involved.

Cavani
 is currently out for three weeks with a thigh injury but remains an 
important signing for the wealthy French club and they would not sell 
for less than the £54m they paid to Napoli last summer.

They also know that Cavani could star for Uruguay at the World Cup, making his price rise even further.

Moyes
 has warned United players to expect greater competition while Chelsea 
will sell Demba Ba and possibly Samuel Eto’o and Fernando Torres too.

United will consider offers for Javier Hernandez in the summer with Borussia Dortmund among those interested while qualification for the Champions League and where they finish could yet have a bearing on Robin van Persie's Old Trafford future.

PSG owner Nasser El-Khelaifi has threatened to retaliate with counter offers for Premier League players should clubs pursue his players, so bids for Cavani could make for an interesting summer.
