Burnley have signed Norwegian midfielder Fredrik Ulvestad on a three-year deal.

Ulvestad has been training with Burnley and had previously played at Aalesunds FK, scoring 14 goals in 106 appearances.

He made his international debut for Norway in August.

Clarets boss Sea Dyche was in need of extra bodies in midfield ahead of the Premier League run-in

Burnley have been in need of midfield reinforcements since Dean Marney suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury against West Brom at the start of February.

The 22-year-old Ulvestad has been without a club since his contract with Aalesunds expired at the end of the last Norwegian season.

Burnley manager Sean Dyche says new signing Fredrik Ulvestad won't be rushed into first-team action.

'It's a new challenge for him now, not only on the pitch but off it too in terms of culture,' Dyche said.

'There will be an adjustment period, for sure, because of the change in the levels of football. We know how tough the Premier League is, so he will be given time to adjust to that accordingly and continue his development.

'Fredrik is someone who came into the club to spend some time with us earlier this year.

'We liked what we saw and he has gained some good experience playing in the league in Norway.

'He has gained a full international cap and is learning and gaining experience all the time. We will be looking for him to continue his development and improve further as a midfielder.'
