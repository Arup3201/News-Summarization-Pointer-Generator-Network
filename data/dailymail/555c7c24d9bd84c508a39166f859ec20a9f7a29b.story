Different managers and a different league. But this was the same old Edinburgh derby. A windswept, blood and thunder affair best viewed through the cracks of the fingers, it finished as most of them do. With red cards and a Hearts win.

The victorious coach Robbie Neilson came closest to the truth when he claimed afterwards: ‘Football broke out a little bit.’ He was being generous.

Hibs captain Liam Craig missed a penalty which proved the forerunner to another day of derby misery and recrimination for the Easter Road club and their captain.

They were edging closer to a point when, from nowhere, Hearts attacker Sam Nicholson smashed a superb 25-yard strike into the top corner of the net in 75 minutes.

Three minutes later the visitors, in their white away shirts, surrendered any hope of a result when Scott Robertson earned a second booking for pushing over Prince Buaben in the penalty area.

The midfielder picked himself up to smash the ball high into the net from 12 yards for 2-0, condemning Alan Stubbs and his 10 men to a seemingly inevitable fate.

It all got too much for some. Osman Sow was red carded for a mid-air elbow on Michael Nelson and according to the defender, it wasn’t his first either. Hibs were also incensed with Hearts sub Jamie Walker escaped an alleged headbutt on Hibs defender Lewis Stevenson moments after Farid El Alagui had pulled a goal back for Hibs.

Easter Road skipper Craig won’t look back on his day with any sense of pride. It began badly with his dragged penalty scraping the outside of the post on its way past and ended with the midfielder being frogmarched down the tunnel for his own protection by a club official, red hair flaming with anger as he sought an old fashioned ‘square go’ with Walker.

Had he mustered even half as much bravado for his penalty kick in 31 minutes Hibs might have taken something from this.

Yet Stubbs refused afterwards to blame the missed penalty for his team’s defeat.

‘The penalty miss came when the game was 0-0 so I don’t think we can look back and say we lost the game because of it,’ said the Hibs boss.

That it was a key moment, however, is undeniable. 

Hearts’ stand-in No 1 Jack Hamilton – the 20-year-old third-choice keeper – was cast into the fire after Neil Alexander shattered his cheekbone against Rangers last week and No 2 Scott Gallacher twisted his ankle.

He was doing fine until El Alagui’s header landed in the no-man’s land and forced him to rush from his line as Hibs attacker Danny Handling tried to muscle in.

Hamilton appeared to get a hand on the ball before clattering into Handling, but referee Willie Collum – a constant source of irritation to the Hearts fans – awarded a soft spot-kick.

To a chorus of boos and cheers, Craig’s run up was confident. But his low, sclaffed, left-foot effort looked horrible from the moment it left his foot, skidding hopelessly wide of Hamilton’s post.

For Hibs, a club which seems cursed in this fixture, it was happening again.

Emboldened by their penalty let-off, Hearts, on the other hand, were working up a head of steam.

Nicholson, a fine prospect at 19, had a terrific chance with a snap shot in 38 minutes after some persistent Hearts pressure from a corner. A goal looked more likely than not until Hibs keeper Mark Oxley threw himself to the ground to make a fine save.

When Jordan McGhee’s controlled right-footed half volley in injury time soared just wide of Oxley’s post, the half-time whistle was timely for Hibs.

The second half threatened to break a new record for free-kicks. It was bitty, scratchy and devoid of finesse, a cavalcade of blocks, thumping, sliding challenges and bookings.

With 15 minutes to play, it was edging grimly towards a scoreless draw and deserved nothing more.

But Nicholson, a lifelong Hearts fan, would be the first player to raise his head and make something happen. Gathering the ball midway into the Hibs half, he performed a sweet nutmeg before galloping forward and smashing an unstoppable shot into the corner of the net past Oxley’s despairing lunge.

Tynecastle erupted. And the gathering storm intensified within three minutes when Hibs midfielder Robertson, booked before half-time, hauled down Buaben in the area, earning a red card.

‘I had no qualms about the penalty,’ said Stubbs after the game. ‘If you put two hands on someone and push them, you can’t expect not to get a penalty against you.

‘I’m not going to hide behind any decisions when they are what they are. I think it was very easy for the referee to give it. He gave us one, which I think was a penalty but he missed one or two things today.’

No one missed the ball nestling high in the net – in the same corner Craig had gone for. For the fifth time in six derbies, Hibs were heading for defeat.

At least under Stubbs their defeats come with a measure of defiance.

Sow, the Hearts matchwinner and hero against Rangers last Sunday, was red carded for catching Michael Nelson with his elbow in mid-air. Afterwards the Hibs man, a cut visible above his right eye, said it came 70 minutes after an identical first offence which went unpunished.

With both teams down to 10 men, Hibs rallied. El Alagui’s header right in front of goal from a Craig free-kick was well saved by Hamilton. But the young keeper could do nothing about a well-taken strike from the No 9 in injury time.

Too little, too late perhaps. The goal did nothing to improve the Hibs mood or darken that of Hearts as the final whistle prompted familiar scenes of bedlam.

Craig was physically pushed down the tunnel for his own protection as Hearts revelled in the realisation that, after two Championship games, they have beaten their two major promotion rivals.
