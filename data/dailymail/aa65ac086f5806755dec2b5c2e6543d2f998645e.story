Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young have been fined and warned over their future conduct after they enjoyed a night out just hours after Manchester United’s quarter-final exit from the Champions League.

The England internationals were photographed in Manchester city centre partying early into last Friday morning after returning from Munich on Thursday.

Manager David Moyes is understood to have called the three in for talks yesterday at United’s Carrington HQ before making them do extra training away from the rest of the first-team squad. All three players have been fined, although it is unclear whether they have been fined one or two weeks’ wages.

Moyes, who faces former club Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday, is in the throes of planning a £150million overhaul of his underperforming squad for the summer and is looking for players to stake a claim to remain part of his plans.

In a rare piece of good news for Moyes, it emerged that Robin van Persie has stepped up his fitness routine as he continues his recovery from a knee injury.

The United striker released a Facebook video that shows him lifting weights and running while training alone in the gym.

Van Persie begins by performing half-a-dozen squats while resting a barbell on his shoulders, then runs at high speed while bouncing on a trampoline and then sprints to the far side of the hall.

It raises the possibility Van Persie could return to action for United before the end of the season and also hands a major boost to Holland ahead of the World Cup in Brazil.

The 30-year-old was taken off on a stretcher after scoring a hat-trick to see United past Olympiacos in the last 16 of the Champions League on March 19.

He was initially ruled out for between four and six weeks with a sprained knee and faced a fitness race to make Louis van Gaal’s squad for the finals.

Van Persie has scored 17 goals in 27 matches for United this season, maintaining his excellent form of the previous year despite the team languishing down the table in a difficult first campaign for new manager Moyes.

Van Persie watched the match between PSV Eindhoven and his former club Feyenoord at the Phillips Stadion on Saturday with Van Gaal and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman.

Van Gaal, who is stepping down from the national team job after the World Cup, has been linked with Manchester United in the last week as pressure mounts on Moyes.
