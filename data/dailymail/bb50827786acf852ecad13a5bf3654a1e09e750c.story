A 17-year-old girl died after suffering massive internal bleeding from a routine appendix operation.

Victoria Katie Harrison, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was admitted to Kettering General Hospital for the procedure on August 15 this year.

Young, fit and healthy, the trainee hairdresser's operation was supposed to be straightforward. Instead, she began to bleed heavily.

Despite desperate attempts to save her, Victoria died the next day. An investigation into her death is now underway.

Victoria Harrison died after after routine surgery to remove her appendix. It's claimed by her family that she developed a tear in her artery after surgeons made an incision to insert their tools

Over 300 people attended the funeral for Victoria, known as 'Tor'. She was buried in a pink coffin, wearing her favourite 'onesie’ outfit and holding a Snickers bar, her favourite snack

Victoria's family claim her death was possibly caused by surgeons accidentally tearing a hole in an artery while inserting a micro-camera into her stomach.

The appendix is usually removed via keyhole surgery as it means a shorter stay in hospital and a quicker recovery. It takes around 30minutes to perform under a general anaesthetic.

The surgeon makes two or three small cuts of about 1cm each in the lower abdomen and passes special instruments through to remove the organ.

A tiny camera is also inserted - this beams up images on to a nearby screen so the surgeon can see what's happening inside the body. Once the appendix has been removed, the cuts are then closed with stitches or glue.

Victoria's devastated mother Tracy Foskett has taken to a Facebook group set up in her daughter's memory to explain to baffled friends why she died.

She wrote: 'Just to let everyone know, Victoria died of internal bleeding from a tear to the hole where they inserted the camera. But she did not suffer.'

She later added: 'She was such a lovely girl - everyone called her their best friend. She was also my best friend - I even go to call her sometimes now. She was loved by so many people and she was so popular.

'We are such a close family and did so much together. I don’t ever want her to be forgotten.'

Over 300 people attended the funeral for Victoria, known as 'Tor', when she was laid to rest last month.

She was buried in a pink coffin, wearing her beloved ‘onesie’ outfit and holding a Snickers bar - her favourite snack.

Kettering General Hospital’s chief executive, Lorene Read, said: 'The Trust can confirm it is investigating the circumstances surrounding the unexpected death of a patient following an operation at the hospital on August 15.

'We have been working closely with the family of this patient and with the authorities to ensure a thorough investigation into the matter is made prior to an inquest. We cannot comment further at this point.'

A police spokesman said: 'An inquest has been opened and adjourned by the coroner and we are waiting for a date to be fixed. An investigation is currently ongoing.'
