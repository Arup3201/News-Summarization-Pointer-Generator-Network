Manchester City defender Dedryck Boyata has signed a new two-year contract.

The 23-year-old Belgian’s previous deal was due to expire this summer.

Boyata has been with City since 2007 and can therefore be registered as a homegrown player in the Premier League and Champions League.

That made retaining him an attractive proposition as the club look to stay within the quotas.

Boyata was a regular in Manuel Pellegrini’s squads last season but made just six first-team appearances.

Only
 one of them was in the Premier League with the rest in domestic cup 
competitions. He was even sent off in one of those, at Blackburn in the 
FA Cup third round.

Boyata has twice been loaned out during his time with City, to Bolton in 2011-12 and FC Twente the following season.
