Andy Murray has not only reached the second week of the US Open, he is also likely to have seen the back of the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he rarely fails to flirt with danger.

The 2012 champion will hope to be back on the main Arthur Ashe Stadium for the rest of the event after nearly allowing a mini crisis to become another drama on Flushing Meadows' more disheveled secondary arena.

Having started beautifully he suddenly had all the positive energy drain from him in the third set before beating the free hitting Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 6-1, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 in two hours and 36 minutes.

It may continue to be this way until he gains the confidence from beating top ten players again, and he has that chance on Monday against Frenchman Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who meets him in the fourth round.

These seems little point in looking beyond that to a possible quarter final with Novak Djokovic, who is looking ominously good after faltering badly in his two post-Wimbledon tournaments, and has reached the last sixteen for the loss of just eighteen games.

The Scot's performance was a football-style game of two halves that saw him unexpectedly lapse into some bad pre-Ivan Lendl habits in the third set marked by poor body language and outbursts against himself. 

His new coach Amelie Mauresmo will try and cajole him out of that, and her influence may have been behind his high count of well-judged forays to the net. Yet it was his traditionally outstanding returning skills that decided a match against a frustrating opponent who enjoyed several hot streaks.

Murray managed to break serve eight times in all, ruthlessly exploiting the relatively weak Kuznetsov serve. There are unlikely to be such pickings on offer in the next round.

Ultimately he survived another visit to an arena he finds tricky, where early in the fourth set he complained about the dangerous proximity of a television camera at the back of the tight arena.

'I wasn't cross, just making the point that I nearly ran straight into the camera with my knee,' he said. 'Obviously I've had a couple of bad experiences there. Last Monday was not a great experience. That's hard to put out of your mind.

'On this court the wind swirls around a lot. Sometimes you can play four games in a row into the wind because it changes so often. That's tricky. Also it's a very tight There's not much runback compared with Ashe.

'Today the match could have been a bit quicker if I got that breakpoint at 4-All in the third set. But each time I had a slip, I did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets, getting a break straightaway.'

From the off the 27 year-old Scot looked a lot sharper than he did in the first round, as he tries to gain the full momentum that has been elusive this year, with the run at the French Open into the semi-finals the nearest he has come to finding it.

A second break made it a comfortable first set and all his vital signs were in good working order, with impressive movement and the backhand being manoeuvred with its old metronomic efficiency. He was also getting plenty of free points in his last two meetings with the swinging serve into the deuce court.

The close to ideal mix of defence and attack that he constantly seeks continued with an early break in the second, which was wiped out by a sudden streak of winners from the Russian which brought him back level.

Only at 5-5 did Murray reassert his superiority, again crunching away the short second serves of Kuznetsov to break handsomely and then serve it out minus any dramas, concluding with a loud 'Come On!'

That should really have sealed matters, only for the number eight seed to lapse as he is wont to do in a way you rarely see from the likes of Djokovic or Rafael Nadal when they are really firing.

The positive energy suddenly seeped from Murray as Kuznetsov upped his level and, letting out a tirade of abuse at himself and allowing his body language to sag, he played a poor game against the highly mobile Russian to be broken for 3-1, capping with a double fault.

Fortunately he was again able to pull level thanks largely to his ability to punish anything short on the second serve, but it is one of his mysteries how he sometimes manage to tune out of a match without any warning and get so frustrated.

Having restored order and missed two break points at 4-4, one of them lost to flukey net cord, he threw in another poor game to lose the set with a double fault. After taking the dreaded toilet break to compose himself he came out and trampled all over the Russian's serve to get over the line.

He and Tsonga have a long rivalry with Murray normally coming out on top when it matters. Monday represents an opportunity, albeit a challenging one, to set himself up for the hardest task of all, the rejuvenated Djokovic.
