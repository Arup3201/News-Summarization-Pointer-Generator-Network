When Graham Wilkinson’s 12-year-old son got out of his van as he stopped at a zebra crossing, he thought nothing of it.

But the seven-second stop, which also allowed pupils to cross the road safely, has landed him with a parking ticket and a potential £70 fine.

Council officials say Mr Wilkinson was ‘parked’ during the brief stop outside Shoeburyness High School in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. The incident was captured on film by one of the council’s two spy cars.

The image provided on the penalty 
notice shows Mr Wilkinson’s white van stopped at the crossing as 
children cross the road and his son Joel, a Year 8 pupil at the school, 
gets out.

Mr Wilkinson, from
 Shoebury, Essex, said: ‘I’ve been getting quite worked up about it. 
It’s a ludicrous decision – it’s not like I have parked up and got out.

‘I even spoke to a police officer to see if I was breaking some road traffic law but they said I wasn’t.

‘You can clearly see the kids walking across, I couldn’t have driven on even if I’d have wanted to.

‘My son got out at that point but only because we were already stopped at the zebra crossing.’

Council chiefs are planning a massive increase in the number of CCTV spy cars to fine Britain's hard-pressed motorists. 

The move is despite a pledge by local government secretary Eric Pickles to outlaw the controversial cars.

Motorists claim that the cars are a 'cash cow' and are being used to raise extra revenue.

There are currently in excess of 100 of the cars (above)  on Britain's roads.

Drivers, like Graham Wilkinson, have been forced to hand over at least £30 million in fines over the past 12 months.

However, 44 per cent of the 2,500 motorists who appealed the CCTV evidence had the fines overturned.

Drivers can take their case to a Traffic Penalty Tribunal to consider their case.

Local government minister Brandon Lewis came out to support motorists claiming: 'They are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale. 

'They undermine natural justice, as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal.'

Mr
 Wilkinson received the fixed penalty notice from the council on Friday,
 March 7. It orders him to pay £35 within 21 days or face a £70 fine.

Zulfiqar
 Ali, the council’s strategic highways and traffic manager, said: ‘There
 is an appeals process if people wish to challenge a penalty charge 
notice they have been issued with.

‘We look at each case on its own merit based on the evidence and representations made.’

The
 council’s two spy cars have raked in almost half a million pounds in 
their first two years  in operation. The Toyota iQs, each equipped with a
 rotating CCTV camera on the roof, issued 15,256 tickets between July 
2011 and March 2013, generating £485,950 for the local authority.

Bill
 Cook, of Cook’s Coaches which provides a school-run service in the 
area, says the fines are making jobs at nearby Chase High School and 
Lancaster School uneconomical.

It
 is believed some schools have even resorted to paying fines on behalf 
of the firms just to keep the coach service running. Mr Cook said: 
‘There needs to be a little common sense coming into these decisions.

‘It is as simple as that, but those in power cannot see it. It is just a money game.’

Nick
 Pickles, director of civil liberties and privacy pressure group Big 
Brother Watch, said many councils ignored rules which say CCTV cars must
 be used only where it was dangerous for a traffic warden to work.

He
 added: ‘The huge numbers of tickets given out in error and later 
dropped highlights the risk to innocent people of these  spy cars.

‘When
 people see the multi-million-pound enterprise that CCTV cars have 
become they will rightly be asking if this is less about public safety 
and more about revenue raising.

‘Equally, the high revenues highlight what a lousy deterrent CCTV is – even when it is a blindingly obvious spy car.

‘Councils
 should be working to solve the underlying problems of congestion around
 schools and understand why so many children arrive by car.’

Last September, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to ban the controversial vehicles.

Mr
 Pickles said he wanted to ‘rein in over-zealous and unfair rules’, and 
that traffic wardens with cameras could do the job instead.
