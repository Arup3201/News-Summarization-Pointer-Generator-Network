A man who shot dead his school vice principal when he was 14 has revealed his dramatic transformation from bespectacled pupil to tattooed inmate as he appears in court eight years on.

Kenneth Bartley Jr. attempted to hide from cameras as he entered Campbell County court in Jacksboro, Tennessee on Monday, where he learned details of his upcoming new trial.

He also came face-to-face with the devastated family of his victim, Ken Bruce, who sobbed and clung to each other as they saw the man who took away their beloved husband and father.

The trial is scheduled for February 
and on Monday, a judge ruled that while Bartley will be tried within Campbell
County, jury selection will take place from outside the county.

The decision came after defense attorney Gregory P. Isaacs argued that the profile of the case had remained high in the area due to eight years of legal wrangling, Knox News reported.

District Attorney General Lori Phillips-Jones said there was no proof that people in the county were biased against Bartley, but the judge said he wanted the case to be resolved.

He said that by using jurors from another county, it was less likely there would be grounds for a successful appeal - meaning the victim's family could finally achieve some closure.

He did not say which county would provide the jurors.

Isaacs said he and Bartley were both 
pleased with the decision as he had a slim chance of a fair trial within
the small community of Campbell County, where many have a connection to
the school.

'It's just an opportunity he's not had before,' Isaacs told MailOnline.

Bartley was a 14-year-old 
freshamn when he brought a gun he found at home to Campbell County 
Comprehensive School on November 8, 2005.

After
Bartley's classmates reported seeing the gun, he was summoned to the 
office, where the assistant principal and two administrators were 
waiting, and asked to hand it over.

When
Administrator Gary Seale and Jim Pierce and Assistant Principal Ken 
Bruce began questioning him, a struggle ensued and he fatally shot 
Bruce, 48, in the chest.

The
administrators were also hurt but wrestled the .22-caliber pistol from 
the boy; Seale, 55, was shot in the abdomen and Pierce, 56, was shot in 
the chest, but they recovered in intensive care.

All three were credited with preventing a much larger tragedy from unfolding at the school.

'The courageous efforts of Gary and Jim 
and Ken probably saved many other lives and the lives of our students,' schools director Judy Blevins said at the time. 'So we have to think about what they have done and how they 
reacted and what they possibly saved this community.'

In
April 2007, Bartley took a last-minute plea deal - pleading guilty to 
second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder - as jury selection was about to begin for his trial.

He was sentenced to 45 years behind 
bars - 25 years for the murder followed by two consecutive 10-year 
sentences for the attempted murders.

One month after entering the plea, he tried to withdraw it but was denied.

However, he has now been granted a trial after the judge ruled the teen was not given enough time to consider the plea deal.

His lawyer told MailOnline that Bartley is denying that he is guilty of first or second degree murder.

'The main question was what was his intention?' Isaac said. 'We're confident that there's going to no proof that he went to school to kill anyone.'

The victim's family said they just wanted to get through the trial so they can finally see the justice that Bruce deserves and to put an end to the legal wrangling.

'If this is what we need to do to get closure, then that's what we'll do,' his wife, Jo Bruce, said.
