Revelations: Jonathan Aitken gave a telling account of Mrs Thatcher's state of mind

Margaret Thatcher 'did not get' who David Cameron was when the Prime Minister's name cropped up at a dinner party, a former Conservative politician has revealed.

In a telling indication of the Iron Lady's battle with dementia, Jonathan Aitken revealed that Mrs Thatcher seemed to be unaware of who the current British Prime Minister was when he was mentioned by another guest at the dinner table.

The biopic of Margaret Thatcher, The Iron Lady, has attracted controversy for its portrayal of her illness.

And now it seems Mr Aitken, who is writing a book about the formidable former Prime Minister, is fanning the flames by revealing his own account of her dementia.

Mrs Thatcher attended a dinner party at Mr Aitken's house when another guest - also a politician - started talking about Mr Cameron, it was reported.

Mr Aitken, a former Tory minister, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I had one member of the cabinet [at the table] who asked something about David Cameron.

'She obviously didn't get who David Cameron was. I can't ever say I felt protective to her when she was in power, but I felt very lovingly protective towards her then.'

Mr Aitken, whose political career ended in a spectacular fall from grace in the late 1990s, gave a revealing account of what it is like to be in Mrs Thatcher's company since the onset of her dementia.

Political colleagues: Margaret Thatcher with Jonathan Aitken in 2001. He says he is fonder of her now than when she was in power

From one PM to another: Margaret Thatcher outside Number 10 with David Cameron in 2010. However, it has been claimed she 'didn't get' who he was

He revealed that, at a time when she 
attended a dinner party he was hosting, her confused state-of-mind was 
peppered with moments of clarity as she joined the dinner table 
conversation.

He told the 
Sunday Telegraph: 'When she came in [to the conversation] there were one
or two marvellous moments. She suddenly started to talk about 
[politician] Keith Joseph, then later about preparations for her 
wedding.'

Mr Aitken also revealed how he was 'fundamentally disappointed' in The Iron Lady - the biopic of her life, starring Meryl Streep.

The film has been criticised for its portrayal of Mrs Thatcher's illness while she is still alive - a point reiterated by Mr Aitken.

'Marvellous acting'... but Jonathan Aitken said The Iron Lady biopic made him 'uncomfortable' and 'upset'

While he praised Streep's performance, 
he added: 'I felt uncomfortable and a bit upset about the vehicle of the
dementia-ridden lady who flips in and out.'

Mr Aitken admitted he is fonder of Mrs Thatcher now than during her Number 10 years. While she was in power he was a backbench MP and it wasn't until John Major became Prime Minister that he joined the cabinet.

However, he suffered a dramatic fall from grace in 1999 when he was jailed for 18 months for perjury after he lied on oath during a libel case.

Mr Aitken remains the only serving cabinet minister to ever go to prison and, remarkably, he says it was the Thatchers who were among the kindest when he was released after serving seven months of his sentence.

While many of his friends deserted him while he was in prison, Denis and Margaret Thatcher went out of their way to welcome the disgraced minister back into political circles by inviting him to dinner - a gesture Mr Aitken says he will never forget.
