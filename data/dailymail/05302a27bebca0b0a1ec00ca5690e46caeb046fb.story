Horrified: Composer and Radio 3 presenter Michael Berkeley says finding out a handful of music teachers had abused their position of trust with students was a 'bitter blow'

For those of us who have been fighting hard to sustain funding for music education (and to keep it on the school syllabus) it came as a particularly bitter blow to find that a handful of teachers had regularly abused their position of trust with young and vulnerable students.

Some of the stories that have emerged are horrific and reveal systematic and serial sexual abuse that has tarnished, even wrecked, young lives.

The schools and colleges at the centre of recent scandals have in fact produced players of exceptional talent - and still do - so let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water.

You rarely work with an orchestra or ensemble these days without seeing players trained at Chethams, The Purcell School or the Royal Northern College of Music and it must be said that the majority of the staff are dedicated and gifted teachers.

For them, however, it is essential that these institutions now give parents and students the confidence that not only their musical disciplines are in good order but also the conduct of all of their staff.

That is why a group of distinguished musicians and the Children’s Commissioner, Tim Loughton, have demanded that there be a full inquiry into how the abuse at Chethams was able to happen.

When a gifted and leading pianist like Paul Lewis says that teacher/pupil abuse was widespread in his day at Chethams but that no one was prepared to risk their prospects by speaking out it becomes obvious that the pernicious culture of ‘cover up rather than face up’ exists not only in institutions like the NHS but also in music education.

I am reliably informed that, as with Savile, more widespread abuse will soon come to light.

The gravity of the problem and its repercussions was all too vividly demonstrated in the tragic case of Frances Andrade, a Chetham pupil who, following her testimony and cross-examination in the trial of music teacher, Michael Brewer, committed suicide.

It is essential to grasp how, in music tuition in particular, opportunities for errant teachers arise.

Let us imagine a young girl (though it could easily be a boy) whose life revolves around making music, who practises for many hours a day to such an extent that music is her entire life.

At its centre is the charismatic teacher who can do all the things she aspires to, who can show her  that the angle of her bowing arm needs adjusting, who plays duets with her and in so doing gets into an intimate exchange of ideas and nuance.

He explains that to make music she must listen to his every phrase and answer it with a corresponding one of her own.

Very soon the language is verging on the sensuous and flirtatious in much the same way that young dancers cannot but practice the physical intimacy of their craft.

The fact that music transcends words is part of its magic – nothing speaks more powerfully than the music itself.

Indeed, on Private Passions, the 
programme I present every Sunday on Radio 3, well-known people talk 
about the music that is important to them and, whether they are 
discussing Bach, Tchaikovsky or Wagner, are frequently reduced to tears 
and often use the word ‘orgasmic’ because this wonderful art form takes 
us so deeply inside ourselves.

If we can lay bare our soul in simply listening to music, imagine the emotions involved in actually playing it.       

Our young violinist, then, still hardly formed as a person, is confronting profound feelings in the presence of a teacher who has begun to take on a guru-like importance in her life.

These are precisely the conditions that have been described by some of the victims. When the teacher oversteps the boundaries,  “Imagine you are playing this naked” was one such remark, begins to touch the pupil in a way that is clearly moving into the realms of the improper and suggests meeting for a drink, the girl is confused.

This is her teacher, after all, the person she trusts and admires.

That is when guilt begins to kick in –
‘it must somehow be my fault and while part of me dislikes it part of 
me is excited by it therefore I must be complicit.’ The stage is now 
horribly set.

The recent 
case of the abused girls in Rochdale is worth recalling because even 
without the heady mix of making music these kids, who were met at the 
school gates by their groomers, somehow felt that they should repay in 
kind the goodies, the cigarettes,  the alcohol that had been lavished on
them and made them feel that they were living a more sophisticated life
than their largely impoverished 14 years had previously seen.

‘We just thought it was the price we had to pay,’ one of them said when describing how she was abused, indeed raped, by not just one but a whole group of now convicted men.

As with the adolescent and gyrating girls who streamed into the Top of the Pops studio fuelled by a rush of intoxicating music and a glimpse of their pop heroes plus celebrities like Jimmy Savile, the promise of being grown up, of mixing with the famous, opens children to predatory adults.

It need not be like this: I worked as a young treble with my Godfather, Benjamin Britten, and though he clearly felt more at ease with children, boys in particular, and though much of his work is obsessed with the theme of the corruption of innocence he never showed anything but completely acceptable  affection towards me and my colleagues.

However, we were in such awe of him and his gifts, I can well imagine the confusion we would have felt had he sought to take advantage of our hero worship.

Guilt is the predominant psychological driving force that makes life an ongoing misery for young victims of abuse.

It’s almost as though the abuser 
transfers his or her guilt to the victim because in most of these cases 
there seems little remorse when people like Michael Brewer are brought 
to justice.

Curiously, 
these are similar to the emotions described by survivors of the 
holocaust. It is not simply the guilt of surviving where so many others 
did not but that victims of violence and abuse feel permanently tainted,
soiled by the darkness that they have been exposed to.

One
of the reasons that the Royal Northern College of Music has been 
brought into the fray is that despite the then distinguished Head of 
Piano Studies, Martin Roscoe, warning the Principal that the person he 
was considering appointing as Head of Strings, Malcolm Layfield, had a 
bad reputation as a result of his behaviour when teaching at Chethams, 
the RNCM still saw fit to go ahead with the appointment.

Layfield
has now left his post but, reading the correspondence, it is worrying 
is that when someone as highly respected as Roscoe blew the whistle 
pretty loudly, and was backed up by others, he still met with deaf ears 
meaning that young lives might have been put at risk.

This
is unacceptable - an inquiry needs to examine vetting and consider 
security and vigilance, maybe closed circuit television, so that the 
good name of our music schools and the safety of their students are 
protected.
