The agony, guilt and sense of abandonment experienced by the hostages of the Sydney siege have been revealed as they recounted their memories of the horrific 17-hour ordeal and the split-second opportunities they had to escape.

While some believed they risked dying if they stayed at the Lindt Café, others admitted to Channel Nine's 60 Minutes that they felt a responsibility to remain, convinced by the gunman's threats that he would shoot one hostage for each one that fled.

Paolo Vassallo, a father-of-two who was one of the first to escape the scene at Martin Place on December 15, recalled the moment he offered 19-year-old café co-worker Fiona Ma the opportunity to run out with him.

'I said "look, we're going now. You're coming with me". She's like: "I can't, I can't" and I was like "why, Fiona?". I ran, I didn't turn around,' Mr Vassallo, who was the third hostage to escape, told 60 Minutes.

Mr Vassallo, pictured fleeing the cafe, spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson. 'I said sorry to him. I said "sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you",' Mr Vassallo said

He also spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson, who was shot dead by Man Haron Monis just before the siege's end.

'I said sorry to him. I said "sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you",' Mr Vassallo said.

Ms Ma, who was the first hostage to find out about fellow captive Harriette Denny's secret pregnancy – which she called 'a good moment in a bad day' - revealed she was simply unable to leave the others behind.

'I can't leave people behind because I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt,' she recalled telling Mr Vassallo.

She was one of the last to leave the cafe before police made the decision to storm it.

Others, like 30-year-old Ms Denny, revealed the split-second opportunities they had to escape earlier in the day and recalled grasping the moment without a thought.

'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny (far left) said

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman refused to budge until the very end, just before police stormed the cafe

Reenacment: He recalled Monis telling the hostages: 'If someone else leaves, someone dies'

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege. 'He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said

'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny said.

As more and more people escaped, the remaining hostages recalled their fear, convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised.

'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman recalled Monis saying. 

'They had left us.'

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old refused to budge until the very end.

'I saw April was standing up and she was pulling the deadbolt up on the side door. Everyone's looking at me because they know that the side door is open.'

Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life.

Neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - Louisa suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72-year-old mother doubted she could run at great speed.  

'I looked up and opened my eyes and they were all gone. [I thought] "Well this is it" but at the same time "I'm ready",' Ms Hope told 60 Minutes.

'I could have organised two or three of the other men to jump him or get something to hit him over the head with but we couldn't organise anything because we were separated,'John O'Brien, one of the first people to escape, told Channel Seven

Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised more of the hostages had escaped.

'Now he's realised another two, and he's heard it, we all heard it. He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said "please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot",' the 43-year-old said.

Other desperate plans also entered the minds of the likes of John O'Brien, one of the first hostages to escape just before Mr Vassallo.

'I could have organised two or three of the other men to jump him or get something to hit him over the head with but we couldn't organise anything because we were separated,' Mr O'Brien told the Seven Network.

It comes after Marcia Mikhael, 43, was hailed a hero by some of her fellow survivors, who revealed that she moved closer to the Sydney siege gunman to allow them to escape.

Elly Chen tells presenter Mark Ferguson that 'she (Marcia) saved my life' after helping her escape from inside the building during the afternoon

Elly Chen, 22, told the Seven Network's 'Inside The Siege: The Untold Story', that 'she (Marcia) saved my life' after helping her and cafe colleague Jieun escape from the building in the afternoon.

'I volunteered to leave my safe little spot because where I was standing was quite safe,' said Ms Mikhael.

The Westpac banking executive's decision to move, closer to barrister Katrina Dawson, put space between  Monis and the two young cafe workers, enabling them to make their move at 5pm, without detection.

'That was really brave of her, I was shocked that she even moved closer to him,' said Jieun.

'I had to help her and I am so glad that she got out of there okay,' Ms Mikhael added.

'That was really brave of her,' Jieun Bae said of Marcia Mikhael. 'I was shocked that she even moved closer to him'

She would be wounded in the gunfight between heavily armed police and Monis, hit by shrapnel in both feet, and look around to see the fatal injury suffered by mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, which a coronial inquiry reported was struck by fragments of bullets fired by police.

'They say that everything happens for a reason and if that's the reason that I was there - to help one person, to help one person cope and to help one person get out alive - then I am very happy with myself,' Ms Mikhael said.

The mother-of-three from Glenwood in Sydney's western suburbs was alongside Ms Dawson, a fellow mother-of-three, and barrister Julie Taylor, for much of the 17-hour ordeal. 

'I had to help her and I am so glad that she got out of there okay,' Marcia Mikhael said of Elly Chen's escape
