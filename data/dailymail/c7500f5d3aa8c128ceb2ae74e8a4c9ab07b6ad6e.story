Eight women have died and more than 60 are in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in central India.

Tubectomies were carried out on 83 women by a single doctor in a government-run 'family planning camp' in the Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state on Saturday.

Dozens fell ill shortly afterwards, and although health officials deny negligence, local media reports that all women had been operated on within a five hour window.

'Reports of a drop in pulse, vomiting and other ailments started pouring in on Monday from the women who underwent surgery,' said Sonmani Borah, the commissioner for Bilaspur district where the camp was held.

'Since Monday eight women have died and 64 are in various hospitals.'

Television footage showed women on stretchers being rushed into hospital with anxious relatives by their side. 

The Indian Express Daily said the surgeries in Chhattisgarh were carried out by one doctor and his assistant in around five hours.

'There was no negligence. He is a senior doctor. We will probe (the incident),' the chief medical officer of Bilaspur R.K. Bhange told the newspaper.

The 83 women who underwent tubectomies at the camp received
incentive payments of 1,400 rupees ($23) to have the surgery,
according to R.K. Bhange, Bilaspur's chief medical officer.
Health workers also got 200 ($3.25) rupees for bringing a woman
to the camp.

The cause of the deaths of the eight women had not been
determined, according to Bhange, but he said they had been
vomiting before they died.

Senior state health officials have been sent to investigate.

'As of now, the government has not found any evidence of
negligence,' said Bhange. He said the government doctors who had
performed the surgeries were experienced in the procedure.

Deaths due to sterilization are not a new problem in India,
where more than four million sterilizations were performed in
2013-14, according to the government.

Between 2009 and 2012, the government paid compensation for
568 deaths resulting from sterilization, the health ministry
said in an answer to a question in parliament two years ago. 

Relatives mourn the death of women who died after undergoing sterilization surgeries. Local media reports that all the women involved had been operated on within a five hour window

Authorities in eastern India came under fire last year after a news channel unearthed footage showing scores of women dumped unconscious in a field following a mass sterilisation.

The women had all undergone surgical procedures at a hospital that local officials said was not equipped to accommodate such a large number of patients.

Health advocates worry that paying women to undergo
sterilization at family planning camps is both dangerous and, by
default, limits their contraceptive choices.

'The payment is a form of coercion, especially when you are
dealing with marginalized communities,' said Kerry McBroom,
director of the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the Human
Rights Law Network in New Delhi.

She said basic care at the camps is often inadequate, with
surgeries rushed through in unhygienic conditions.

Pratap Singh, commissioner of Chhattisgarh's Department of
Health and Family Welfare, said  the state's
sterilization program was entirely voluntary.

The United Nations expressed concern.

'If the facts are confirmed, then a grave human tragedy has
occurred,' said Kate Gilmore, deputy executive director of the
U.N. Population Fund.

'Where there is deviation from clinical standards, there
must be consequences.'
