Chelsea have agreed terms on £2.3million deal for Romanian teenage right back Cristian Manea.

The 17-year-old, who plays for Viitorul Constanta, has already made his debut for the national side when he played against Albania last May.

Manea doesn't turn 18 until August but Chelsea have moved quickly to secure him after interest from Arsenal, Ajax and Udinese.

As Sportsmail reported, Chelsea made initial moves last September to outline a deal with Manea expected to sign a five-year contract and then be loaned out to either Vitesse or Real Mallorca.

Manea has developed quickly under the guidance of first team coach and former Romania captain Gheorghe Hagi.
