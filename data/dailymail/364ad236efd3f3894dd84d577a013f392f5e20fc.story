Leaves on the line, the wrong kind of snow... passengers know all the usual reasons for train delays. Now there’s a new one – signalman stuck in the toilet.

The hapless controller had dashed from his Victorian signal box to its outside toilet but was trapped inside when the lock jammed.

Meanwhile, passengers on the 15.13 Hereford to London service were forced to sit waiting because their train couldn’t proceed without a green light from the box at Henwick, near Worcester.

Train passengers had their journeys delayed for over an hour while rail staffed helped free a signalman who got trapped in an outside toilet near Worcester Foregate Street station

The worker had dashed from his post to the nearby Victorian outhouse to answer a call of nature, but found himself stranded when the lock became stuck

A signalman uses the outside toilet at the Henwick signal box in Worcester. It is unknown if this is the man who became trapped or another man who works there

Eventually the driver – unable to make 
radio contact with the signalman – walked to the box where he heard 
cries for help.

Unable to free the man, he called in an operations 
manager and the door was forced open with a crowbar.

The Hereford to 
London train was delayed for more than an hour.

Publicly, rail bosses said the delay was caused by ‘signalling 
problems’.

The inconvenient truth was flushed out via a rail 
enthusiasts’ internet forum after one user posted the incident log 
online.

It reads: ‘Western Route Incident, Signaller issue at Henwick, update 
16:35. All trains stopped at Henwick (Worcester Foregate Street) due to 
loss of contact with the Signaller at Henwick LC. Driver of 1P65 is 
walking to the signal box to investigate. Update: Local Operations 
Manager is on site and the signaller is stuck in the toilet...’

A Network Rail spokesman apologised for the disruption.

He said: 'Much of the railway is still controlled from Victorian signal boxes, which often have outside loos.

'Our
plans to modernise the railway will see control moved to 
state-of-the-art regional control centres, where unfortunate incidents 
such as this simply wouldn’t be an issue.

'We apologise to anyone whose journey was delayed or disrupted.'

A number of website users took the opportunity to make cracks at the signalman’s expense.

One user, called tsr said: 'Where are the relief staff when you need ‘em...?'

Harbon1 added: 'Too busy filling in the signalman’s log.'

Rail bosses publicly announced the reason for the delays as 'signalling problems'. But the truth was revealed on a rail enthusiasts' internet forum
