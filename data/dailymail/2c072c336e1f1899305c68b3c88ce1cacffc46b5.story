A burger joint owner has been bombarded with death threats after he enraged the vegan community by describing them as ‘single-minded and Nazi-like’ in a Facebook comment.

Mark Clews, who has run the Tuk Tuk restaurant in the Hunter Valley, NSW, for 15 months, posted his views on vegans after he received his first anti-animal product customer on Sunday morning, News.com.au reported.

He wrote on the company’s Facebook page: ‘Well, we had our first ever vegan in yesterday, wearing a tie dyed t-shirt, I’m serious, didn’t matter that it was made in a Chinese sweat shop.’

The Tuk Tuk offers vegetarian burgers but owner Mark Clews warned they are cooked on the same grill as the more popular meat burgers 

After receiving his first vegan customer in the restaurant's 15 months since opening, Mr Clews posted on the company's Facebook page 

In the first of a string of comments, he continued: ‘She was very disappointed that we didn’t have more vegan choices in a hamburger shop? But settled on the falafel burger without yoghurt and without butter.’

Mr Clews told Daily Mail Australia that he went over to her table to warn her that the pattie would be cooked on the same grill as the beef, pork and lamb patties because they don’t have time to clean the top inbetween every order and she told him that it was fine.

‘I said “I’m very sorry, it may contain traces of slaughtered animals” and she happily ate it anyway,’ he said. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Guess she wasn’t that vegan after all, it’s a funny world.’

Mr Clews explained that he then ‘put a very flippant, Australian, larrikin comment on our Facebook paged and it didn’t go well.’

A woman posted on the Tuk Tuk page: ‘Do not mess with the Vegans, EVER!!!!’

Mr Clews said he won't apologise for not being 'politically correct'

One commentator wrote 'do not mess with the Vegans. Ever!!!' Mr Clews replied saying they are 'Nazi like in their conviction'

Angry commentators bombarded Mr Clews Facebook page but he did not back down

To which he replied: ‘But they are so easy to mess with. They lack physical strength because of zero red meat in their diet! They are single-minded and Nazi-like in there conviction!

‘Their "veganism" was inspired by some tragic childhood event, or a divorce, or a car accident or some crap.

‘And the worst thing, from a chef’s point of view is they cannot cook a vegetable to save their life, they are sh*t cooks, end of story, over and out.’

He said the vegan moment has now adopted him as the latest business to ‘attack with their vitriol, with their threats of violence’.

He explained that angry vegans had found his personal phone number online and rang him at 11pm on Sunday night.

Mr Clews was told that his family would be 'slaughtered' in one alarming phone call

Despite the controversy, Mr Clews said on Monday he had the best day's trade since the restaurant opened

‘They said “I’m going to come and slaughter you like you slaughter animals”,’ he revealed.

‘I’m worried for the safety of my family and workmates… there are a lot of comments on Facebook saying there is going to be a delegation on Tuesday who are going to “flog the f*** out of me”.’

Mr Clews said he won’t apologise for not being ‘politically correct’ but if the vegan woman walked into the shop again he would apologise if he had caused her any offence.

He described how he loves animals, is anti-horse racing and only uses free-range eggs at the restaurant and locally and ethically sourced meat.

‘The idiotic thing is I let every possum and kangaroo live on my land. I feed the chooks our scraps from the restaurant, I have two pet pigs that are like my babies, I’ve got my dog I spent $600 at the vet on recently.

'I have a pet parrot that lives inside my home, the whole home is her aviary, I have a pet snake with a permit for, I have a horse who I refuse to ride as I think its animal cruelty…. I am someone who loves and cares for animals,’ he reasoned.

Despite the controversy, Mr Clews said on Monday he had the best day's trade since the restaurant opened.
