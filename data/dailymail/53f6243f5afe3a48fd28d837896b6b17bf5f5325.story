Thousands of Walmart workers have descended on stores across the country to protest against low wages and part-time schedules in massive coordinated Black Friday strikes.

Swarms of protesters gathered at 1,600 Walmarts in 49 states on Friday morning to picket the stores or stage sit-ins, while other workers started walking out on their shifts as early as Wednesday.

The employees are protesting poor wages, which are often so low that they put workers below the poverty line - even though the company makes $16 billion a year in profit.

While some are paid $8 or $9 an hour, Walmart's largest stockholders - Christy, Jim, Alice and S. Robson Walton - enjoy the title of America's richest family. Together they are worth $145 billion.

The company also routinely gives workers part-time hours so that they are not entitled to benefits such as health insurance, Mother Jones pointed out.

Walmart pays many of its workers less than $25,000 a year, Bloomberg reported, with some full-time employees averaging $15,500. The 2014 federal poverty line for a family of four is $23,850.

A recent report commissioned by Congressional Democrats found that each Walmart costs taxpayers between 900,000 and $1.75 million per year as so many workers have to rely on government aid. 

The protests on Friday were organized by the union-backed Organization for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart), which was founded in 2011.

Workers took part in the protests, but they were also joined by other members of their communities. 

The group is getting louder; just two years ago, protesters picketed 28 stores compared to this year's 1,600. In Washington, there are protests at every one of the state's 64 stores.

In an appeal on its Facebook group on Thursday, the group wrote: 'Today we are thankful for all of us who are on strike today to protest how Walmart abuses their power and extraordinary wealth to stop Associates from speaking out.

'After years of being paid so little that many of us skip meals just to get by, we have joined OUR Walmart to challenge the richest family in America to pay us more. The right to speak freely and protest are fundamental to America and the only way will make change. Join us this Black Friday.'

This year, workers walked out of their shifts across California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, D.C, Mother Jones reported. 

In Chicago, 11 people associated with the OUR Walmart group were arrested while blocking traffic in front of a downtown store. In Washington D.C., some staged a sit-down strike.

'Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart you're no good. Treat your workers like you should,' a crowd of several dozen shouted outside the store in Chicago.

'I'm 32 and I am nowhere near where my parents were at this time in their lives,' Shomari Lewis, a worker from a Walmart in Dallas, told the publication. He makes around $9 an hour.

'I thought getting a job a the nation's largest employer would be a great way to start a career, but boy, was I wrong… I don't know how we are supposed to have families or raise them when Walmart is keeping us in poverty.'

Another worker, Richard Reynoso, from Los Angeles, said he hadn't eaten since yesterday. 

'The hunger I'm experiencing right now is all too familiar,' he said. 'Many Walmart workers experience it every day… [but] nobody who works for the richest company in America should ever experience that kind of thing.' 

Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, played down the impact of the protests. She said past protests have focused on a handful of locations with a handful of workers. 

'Perception is not reality in this case. We've seen this story before,' she said. 

She added: 'The crowds are mostly made up of paid union demonstrators, and they do not represent the views of the 1.3 million associates' who work for the company.

Support: Members of the community came out in support of Walmart workers in Lakewood, Colorado

Demands: They are calling for $15 an hour. Many employees reported earning $8 or $9 an hour

Disgruntled: Workers gathered at a staggering 1,600 stores across 49 states to protest the conditions

Buchanan also said one of the demonstrators hit a customer at the Chicago store, prompting a complaint to the police.

Last month, the company announced that, from January 1, it will no longer offer health insurance to employees who work less than an average of 30 hours a week.

The move, which would affect 30,000 employees, follows similar decisions by Target, Home Depot and others to eliminate health insurance benefits for part-time employees.

The store also recently made headlines after an employee organized a food drive for fellow workers at an Oklahoma City store.

A bake sale was also held by employees in need in Indiana along as campaigners put pressure on the company not to ignore the voices of employees who are going hungry. 

The company employs 1.4 million people, which is nearly 10 per cent of all retail workers in the U.S.
