The man questioned over the balcony death of a young New Zealand woman has denied reports he had secret cameras in his apartment and that police had seized a 'homemade porn' collection.

Gable Tostee has been spoken to by detectives but not charged over the death of Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26.

The 28 year old took to Facebook to reject claims police had taken footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests as they tried to piece together the last moments before Ms Wright fell 14 storeys off his balcony.

'I'd like to point out that this article is an outright lie,' he posted.

Mr Tostee is part of a police investigation following the death of a female tourist who fell from his apartment balcony at the Gold Coast on Friday

'I never had any cameras installed in my Avalon apartment nor did I have a "homemade porn collection". It is a shame that these "journalists" have not only twisted facts and taken my comments out of context but have now resorted to fabricating stories.

Police confirmed they had not removed the items from the Avalon Apartments property.

'The report that there were homemade pornography tapes is absolutely not true,' Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia.

'We took some discs from the apartment. There are no [sex tapes].'

Mr Hutchinson added there was no evidence the apartment was set up with cameras or surveillance equipment.

Police have told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee had refused to give an interview in relation to Ms Wright's death on Friday. He has not been charged with anything.

Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Mr Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex

Ms Wright, a tourist visiting from New Zealand, reportedly met Mr Tostee on the dating app Tinder while she was in the country for a friend's wedding.

The phone of Mr Tostee's friend Tony ­Ongart has also been confiscated by detectives after the pair reportedly made contact after the fatal fall.

Mr Ongart took to Facebook on Tuesday to joke about what may be on his phone and to inform friends not to contact him.

'Hope they (police) watch my pornos,' he posted.

Mr Tostee has been in the spotlight since police started investigating Ms Wright's death last week.

Witnesses claim to have heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from his 14th floor apartment around the time Ms Wright's body was found.

'The examination of mobile phones and other telecommunication devices is a routine part of modern investigations,' Mr Hutchinson said.

He said police have obtained statements from 'a number of women'.

Mr Tostee had sent Stephanie Angus a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they brushed paths on dating app Tinder last year

Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after receiving this message

Detectives have also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, west of the Gold Coast tourist strip.

Mr Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee,  which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab.

Asked whether Mr Tostee was a person of interest in the case, Mr Hutchinson said, 'obviously we are investigating the circumstances of the death of a young lady who fell from the balcony of his unit.

'He is going to be part of that investigation.'

It was revealed on Tuesday night that Mr Tostee had sent a young Sydney woman a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they brushed paths on dating app Tinder last year.

Stephanie Angus said she was sent the alarming message 10 months ago.

'The first message was "Roses are red, violets are blue. I have a gun. Now get in my van" and I thought looking back it was quite creepy,' Ms Angus told A Current Affair.

'It was quite a scary thing for him to have written to me. It was quite a strange thing and it insinuated violence and that's quite a worry.'

Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after.

Police were at the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments on the Gold Coast on Tuesday as part of their investigation

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, said his client would not be making a statement to police in the foreseeable future.

But Mr Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation.

'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her,' he wrote on the forum at 10.21am.

'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip.

'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you.

'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.

'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'

Police leaned over the balcony on the 14th floor on Tuesday as they continued their investigations into Ms Wright's death

Police have obtained statements from 'a number of women' as part of their investigation, but Mr Tostee has refused to give a police statement

A woman who went on a Tinder date with the bodybuilder last September said she believed Mr Tostee was just another 'cocky, arrogant' guy from the Gold Coast.

Brisbane woman Deb said she and Mr Tostee exchanged 'corny hook-up lines' and he had invited her to his apartment but she was too afraid to go alone.

'He did invite me to go down but I'm not going to put myself on the 14th floor with someone I don't know. And I have a massive fear of heights. I would never do it by myself,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Instead, Deb invited Tostee to her fifth-floor apartment for a wine night with her friends and he showed up with Jaegerbombs.

They stayed up drinking until 2am on a Thursday night and she said he seemed 'absolutely normal'.

'We drank with my friends we chatted for a while,' she said.

Ms Wright, a tourist visiting from New Zealand, reportedly met Mr Tostee on the dating app Tinder while she was in the country for a friend's wedding

The 28-year-old told her he was a builder, that he had wealthy parents and that he was named after Clark Gable from Gone With The Wind.

'I wasn't threatened or worried, it's Tinder you don't know them from a bar of soap,' she added.

However, Deb said she ensured she didn't put herself at risk. 

'The number one rule is don't put yourself in a dangerous environment as they are always going to put their best foot forward. I made sure I wasn't alone in my apartment,' she explained.

'They are all good looking, cocky and arrogant, he was one of a million down on the Gold Coast.'
