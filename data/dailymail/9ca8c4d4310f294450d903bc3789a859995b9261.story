Two conmen have been found guilty of persuading a woman to hand over £174,000 as part of a string of frauds against lonely hearts.

A three-week trial at Winchester Crown Court heard how Suzanne Hardman was persuaded into handing over the cash after she was duped when responding to a false profile of an 'attractive middle-aged man' on the match.com website.

Today, Monty Emu, 28, from Southsea in Hampshire and Adewunmi Nusi, from Berkshire were convicted of money laundering.

Suzanne Hardman, who was conned out of £174,000 after she was duped on the dating website match.com by a false profile 

The court heard how once the conmen developed a relationship with their victims, using the fake name James Richards, they then started to request cash.

At first the women were asked for a £700 legal fee by a fake solicitor but then the sums requested rose to up to £100,000.

One of the defendants, Adewunmu Nusi, who today was found guilty of money laundering following a three-week trial 

The court was told that vulnerable women were conned out of £220,000 in total.

The scam included a fictitious lawyer, Rod Thompson of ‘Quality Solicitors’, fake court documents and tax clearance certificates. 

During the trial, Ms Hardman, from Basingstoke, sobbed as she told the court how she was duped by a 'James Richards', who told her his mother had recently died.

She said: 'He was very sociable, we got on, like a friendship. I learnt a bit about his background, I told him a bit about mine.

She said that after they had been communicating for about 11 months, 'James Richards' told her that his dead father had a frozen account in India with £1.5million in it.

He also told her that he intended to sell a number of properties owned by his father.

On the first day of the trial, Emmanuel Oko, 29, Southsea, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering and Chukwuka Ugwu, 28, also of Southsea, admitted money laundering.

Brooke Boston, 28, of Southsea, was cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. 

A sixth person, Eberechi Ekpo, 26, of Southsea, was cleared of money laundering and fraud by false representation part-way through the trial.

Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told jurors that messages of love and 'overblown affection' were sent to the victims through the match.com website before moving on to emails and text messages.

Examples of the messages sent to multiple recipients included: 'You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe, most importantly you make me feel wanted.

'I knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke but neither one of us could imagine the love exploding, no thundering into our hearts.'

Another read: 'Honey, seriously I love you because I have never been loved by anyone like you loved me.

'I feel like a complete man. The thought of your hands on my body, particularly when you hold me when I am sleeping.

'I love your generous kindness to me. I love your eye and lips, your sense of self-love. I want to be with you now.'

This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash

Following the case, prosecutors now say they will now be pursuing those convicted to strip them of their ill-gotten gains.

Detective Constable Darrin Carey of Hampshire Constabulary said: 'This case centres around a web of lies constructed by a devious group of people with the sole intention of exploiting emotionally vulnerable women for financial gain.

'All members of this group played their part in these offences, which left nine women feeling used and embarrassed and has seen them lose significant amounts of money.

'The women were duped into thinking that they were talking to a man who was genuinely looking for love on the dating website match.com. Unfortunately for them, they were part of an elaborate scam.

'These verdicts should send out a clear message to people who think they can hide behind fake profiles and carry out these scams again and again, that they will be caught and dealt with by the courts.

'I would like to thank the women involved in this case for their courage in coming forward to report this and also for going through the distressing experience of giving evidence about a very personal subject.'

The men were accused of using a fake profiles set up on match.com - mainly with the name James Richards - and then gradually swindled cash from vulnerable women

While Simon Edwards of the Crown Prosecution Service added: 'We hope that with these convictions the victims in this case who lost a considerable amount of money and, understandably, could have lost confidence in themselves, will be able to move on with their lives now that the offenders have been brought before the court.

'We will now apply to the court for the ill-gotten assets to be confiscated.'

All four face sentencing on the week of October 13.
