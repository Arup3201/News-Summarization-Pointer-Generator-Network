Mario Balotelli looks set to start for Liverpool against Real Madrid, and his manager Brendan Rodgers will be hoping the striker takes in the form he's shown in training. 

The £16million striker - signed from AC Milan in the summer and who has largely disappointed - scored a deft backheel this week. 

And former Reds midfielder Didi Hamann believes the show of faith in the Italian by Rodgers could benefit him moving forward.

Balotelli was all smiles before the Champions League test against holders Real Madrid on Tuesday night

'It was always going to be hard for him,' Hamann told the Standard.

'Suarez missed 10 games and he still scored over 30 goals – you can't replace that – and Balotelli's a different player, he's never been a work horse, he's always been somebody who picked and chose when to run and where to run.

'But he's a goalscorer, so I don't see what all the fuss is about. He's not playing any different to how he did at City, the only difference is that now he's playing for a struggling team at the moment that can't score, and he doesn't get the chances – and he doesn't score.'

Balotelli appeared in relaxed mood ahead of the clash, but knows he must up his performances
