Ministry of Defence scientists secretly poisoned guinea pigs with the same deadly nerve agent sarin used by Bashar al-Assad in Syria.

Over the past two years 223 guinea pigs were given the banned gas, revered as one of the most murderous weapons in modern warfare, by scientists at the military science base Porton Down in Wiltshire.

The MoD says the 'vital' tests on the animals, who were not anaesthetised, were carried out in the battle to find an antidote for sarin, used by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in an attack against his own people last August.

Assad denied his soldiers were responsible for the attack on the outskirts of Damascus, which killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children, and prompted the threat of military action by the US unless Syria's chemical weapons were destroyed.

But news that the tests were being carried out on animals at Porton Down has angered animal rights charity Peta.

'After all the Prime Minister's tough talk about Syria, it's deplorable that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been secretly using the same chemical nerve agents that Assad has used in order to poison hundreds of animals within our own borders,' a spokesman told MailOnline.

'Not only are these tests cruel, they're also utterly useless, since even though humans and other species experience pain and fear in the same way, every species differs in its physiological responses to chemical agents and antidotes.

'The fact that the MoD, with the best technology in the world at its disposal, still chooses to torture animals in costly and agonising experiments, which cannot be extrapolated to humans, is a bloody stain on the whole country.

'These experiments, using a banned nerve gas, no less, prove that the government's claims about trying to find alternatives to live testing are entirely meaningless.'

The MoD says that after the tests the animals were humanely put down using an overdose of anaesthetic.

'This is vital research used to develop antidotes which save the lives of both troops and civilians, a spokesman told MailOnline.

'Advances in technology mean that we 
are reducing the number of procedures carried out, but some research 
simply cannot be conducted without the use of animals.

Sarin was first developed as pesticide by the Germans in 1938.

It has since been identified as one of the most potent and rapidly acting of the so-called nerve agents.

Even at very low concentrations Sarin can kill in less than ten minutes as direct inhalation leads to suffocation 
from lung muscle paralysis, unless an antidote can be administered.

Sarin in its vapor form causes symptoms within seconds and in its liquid form symptoms appear within minutes.

Sarin
 stops the off-switch enzyme of the body's glands and muscles, causing 
them to work continuously, Symptoms include: Runny nose, watery eyes, 
pinpoint pupils, eye pain, blurred vision, drooling and excessive 
sweating, cough, chest tightness, rapid breathing, diarrhea, nausea, 
vomiting, and/or abdominal pain, increased urination, confusion, 
drowsiness, weakness, headache, slow or fast heart rate, low or high 
blood pressure.

Even a small
 amount of sarin can cause serious injury and many victims will not know
 they've been exposed to the oderless, colorless, tasteless compound.

Sarin has been classified as a weapon of mass destruction and production and stockpiling of the chemical is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993.

'All
 such work complies with the Chemical Weapons Convention which allows 
research on chemical weapons for the development of antidotes.'

The spokesman added that examples of MoD research include improved treatments of trauma which have saved lives in Afghanistan, a treatment for botulism which has saved civilian lives, and safe and effective treatments and pre-treatments for biological and chemical agents.

Just a few drops of sarin, which has no taste, no smell and no colour, can be enough to kill a person in under 10 minutes.

It is usually emitted from a canister or missile, releasing a cloud of droplets fine enough to be inhaled, and can also enter the body through the eyes and skin.

Victims suffer muscle paralysis and even those who survive can be left with permanent neurological damage.

The row of guinea pigs is the latest in a line animal cruelty scandals to hit the MoD.

Last month it was revealed in a Freedom of Information request that almost 200 horses were put down by MoD vets in the last decade, including 20 that were physically healthy but were said to have 'dangerous temperaments.'

And in March it emerged that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries.

Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at Porton Down.

Animal rights groups say the exercises are ‘impossible to justify medically, ethically or educationally’, but the Ministry of Defence insists they help develop treatments that have saved lives in warfare.

It has also been revealed that more than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009.

The MoD put down 42 British dogs due to a 'dangerous temperament', while 27 developed cancer-related health problems.

The majority, 117 were put down due to 'age and welfare' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis.

Four were killed in action in Afghanistan, and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident.
