Soon after Cressida Bonas attended her first official engagement with Prince Harry, shadowy ‘royal sources’ were quick to dampen expectations that it signalled an engagement announcement.

However, I hear that the couple’s relationship has taken a more  serious turn.

‘There is a family gathering to discuss an engagement,’ claims a member of Cressida’s large extended clan. ‘The announcement will be sooner than many people think.’

While the secretive couple arrived to events separately in the past, at Wembley Arena they arrived together and were pictured cuddling in the crowd

One of the 25-year-old dancer’s close friends tells me: ‘Harry and Cressida will be married. It is all going ahead. It is just a matter of time.’

The daughter of aristocratic Sixties model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and businessman Jeffrey Bonas was photographed cuddling up to Harry last month at the WE Day UK youth event at Wembley Arena, where he gave the keynote speech.

While the couple have been secretive in the past, arriving separately at parties, this time they were happy to be photographed cuddling and displaying open signs of affection.

The next day, she accompanied him to Twickenham to watch England play rugby.

A source at Balmoral told me recently that the Prince was planning to take Cressida to the Queen’s Scottish retreat this summer.

It would be her first visit and likely to involve a meeting with Her Majesty. ‘It is the talk of the estate,’ I was told.

According to a source, Cressida was initially reluctant to marry into Royalty, but has come around to the idea

Visits to the Queen’s 49,000-acre home in the Highlands are a rite of passage for any royal bride-to-be. Kate Middleton and her parents were invited to join Prince William on a private shooting party at Balmoral in October 2010.

William and Kate’s engagement was announced the following month.

Last October, Cressida was reported to have overcome her fears about marrying into the Royal Family.

‘Cressie is going to marry Harry,’ one of her friends told a broadsheet newspaper. ‘Harry never stops talking about marriage and children, and she’s now got used to the idea. The wedding is likely to take place next year.’

Cressida is thought to be visiting Balmoral this summer with Harry, a rite of passage for any future Royal bride. Kate holidayed there with William in 2010 and the marriage was announced a month afterwards
