This video of jets landing in crosswinds at Birmingham Airport is enough to make even the most resilient rider plan their next trip by train.

As the planes near the runway, gusts of wind blow them sideways, almost stopping them in their tracks.

The videos, shot over the past month, when winds have battered the British Isles, show just how much planes can swing from side-to-side while coming in to land.

As the clip shows, at times it can be almost impossible to steer the plane in a straight line.

One can only imagine what the poor passengers trapped inside were thinking as they waited frantically for the journey to end and the seat belt sign to turn off.

Let's hope that nobody who endured this stomach-churning episode was trying to conquer their fear of flying that day. 

Crosswinds: A jet had a scary landing in Birmingham this month due to less than ideal weather conditions

In good hands: High winds at the beginning of the month meant many pilots had to perform some skilled landings across England

The video is an example of footage taken by aviation enthusiast Flugsnug, which shows captains having a difficult time navigating planes at the West Midlands airport around the start of the new year.

This is because the weather conditions were unfavorable, especially for smaller and lighter jets.

Flugsnug informs MailOnline that 'Dash-8 and ATR twin-engines have a difficult time coping with gusts and windshear.'
