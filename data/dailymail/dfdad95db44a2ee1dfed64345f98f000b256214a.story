'Invisible Woman': Methodist minister Sara Cliff (pictured) has quit her post as councillor for Lincoln East after fierce protests from residents that she lived 100 miles away from the ward

A Methodist minister who received £23,000 as a councillor for a deprived area while living more than 100 miles away has resigned in the face of fierce opposition from residents.

Months after being elected as a Tory councillor for the area of Lincoln East, Reverend Sara Cliff moved to upmarket Soham, 119 miles away in Cambridgeshire.

Mrs Cliff, 46, turned up to council sessions in Lincolnshire just 19 times in three years. She was paid an average of £1,200 in allowances per session.

With the meetings lasting two and a half hours, it means she was paid almost £500 an hour for the job.

After details of her absences and allowances emerged last week, Mrs Cliff faced angry calls to resign, with critics labelling her the ‘Invisible Woman’.

And yesterday, the Methodist minister finally confirmed she would resign – although she attacked the ‘unwarranted hostility’ she feels forced her hand.

The news was welcomed by members of the local community, who said it was ‘about time’ they could elect someone who would better represent them.

Local resident Fran Paterson, 53, said: ‘She should have resigned as soon as she moved over 100 miles away. She was never going to be able to represent our community and she knew it.

‘It’s a disgrace that it took so many people to complain for her to eventually go.’

Labour county councillor John Hough added: ‘She should have resigned a long time ago.

‘It’s a shame it took the publicity for her to make the decision.

‘But it’s the right decision and it’s about time that the people in Lincoln East had proper representation.’

Mrs Cliff was elected in May 2009 to Lincolnshire County Council as the representative for Lincoln East, one of the most deprived areas in the country.

Two months later, she moved 119 miles away to Soham to take a job as a Methodist minister but refused to quit as councillor.

As well as attending eight full county council sessions, records show she went to meetings of the Strategic Planning Scrutiny Sub Committee.

In her three years, she sat on just 11 out of a total of 37 meetings of this committee.

Council records show Mrs Cliff sat in on six of a possible eight committee meetings in 2009.

She went on to attend just four of a possible 17 in 2010 and sat in on just one meeting last year. This year she relinquished any committee responsibilities.

She did not spend a penny of her £2,000 community budget last year.

Among those calling for her resignation last week was Rob Parker, the Labour leader of the council.

He said: ‘She’s the invisible woman. She was missing at this year’s budget meeting when huge cuts were brought in which will affect the people she represents.

‘Her ward is one of the most deprived in the country but she wasn’t there to speak up for her constituents.’

Last night, Mrs Cliff said: ‘I have taken the decision to resign my position from the county council.

‘While I did feel willing and able to carry on representing the people of Lincoln East, in view of the unwarranted hostility I am clear that this action is in the best interests of the Methodist church, the county council and my own family.’
