It's that time of year when we all want to strip off, throw our inhibitions to the wind and indulge in a bit of swimming pool action -  and Australia is definitely the place to jump into the deep end.

Public pools are all well and good at the end of a sweaty coastal walk but they're often crowded, full of screaming kids, hair and the odd floaty Band Aid.

So imagine how amazing it would be to have your own luxury lagoon, to enjoy a refreshing drink and not worry that the water may turn blue if the kid pees in it?

Luckily we're renowned for sun, sea, sand and swimming pools and here are five of the best on the market at the moment:

Not for the faint-hearted, whoever buys this crib may need to invest in suitable dinner-party swimming attire

1. 23 Power Avenue, Toorak, VIC

Never mind Power Avenue, this 1930s Arnaud Wright Regency is a power-house-turn stately home with its paved and tiled 15 metre lap pool set among the powerful pungent aroma of native flowers.

With wooden floorboards and a sweeping staircase it's extremely grand - more Downton than down and out - and looks more like a traditional British country pile than city dwelling.

Set on 1,600m2 the tennis court runs the length of the property and also features two pergolas with heating, electric blinds, an outdoor spa and street lamps.

Boasting six bedrooms, or five and a study, a gym, open fireplaces and a huge walk-through cellar it's also decked out with classic furniture pieces, including chandeliers and zebra-print Ottomans.

Did anyone say Pimms? Sun-seekers can lounge on the deckchairs and glance over the pool to watch tennis

2. 24 Skyline Drive, Maribyrnong, VIC

It we're going with 'to infinity and beyond', this award-winning cracker designed by owner architect Ferras Raffoul of FGR Architects is beyond. Way beyond.

The 15 metre lap-pool is situated on the rooftop just a stone's throw away from the palatial Toorak property above, with stunning panoramic city skyline views.

The pool is an aesthetic delight, with acrylic walls on three sides can be seen from the top floor kitchen and living /dining areas and runs along the third level of the 415sqm house.

This one will set you back at least a cool $2.5 million.

3. Alkira, 3726 Cape Tribulation Road, Daintree

Alkira, which in Aboriginal means ‘bright and sunny, a happy place in the sun’ is situated in 73 lush acres of Daintree Rainforest and hopefully there are no crazy crocs lurking here.

This contemporary crib's man-made assymetrical blue swimming pool is the focus of the property, set centrally and with a series of pod-like rooms surrounding it.

The kind of log cabin-meets-futuristic-meets alien space-station house - which has a secluded private beach - is a full-on sensory delight suspended within an engineered lake.

Its funky design is the brain-child of architect Charles Wright who was named The Australian Institute of Architects 2014 House of the Year for Queensland. 

And it's the only place in the world where two World Heritage listings converge, the Great Barrier Reef and the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.
