Scotland's Richie Ramsay made a flying start to set the early pace in the first round of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai on Thursday.

Ramsay took advantage of ideal conditions to birdie the first three holes on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates, moving to three under par and into a one-shot lead over South African Thomas Aiken and England's Tyrrell Hatton.

English trio Ross Fisher, David Howell and Oliver Wilson were a shot further back, with Wilson recovering from a bogey at the first with birdies from eight and three feet at the third and fifth respectively.

With the players going out in reverse order according to their positions on the Race to Dubai, world number one Rory McIlroy and defending champion Henrik Stenson were in the final group at 12.30 local time.

McIlroy has not played since finishing second to Wilson in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in the first week of October, the 25-year-old withdrawing from scheduled appearances in the first two Final Series events in China to prepare for his upcoming court case with a former management company.

So it was perhaps no surprise that the four-time major winner had posted on Twitter: 'Just under 3 hours until I hit my first competitive golf shot in 6 weeks. To say I'm excited is an understatement. #imready.'

McIlroy wrapped up the Race to Dubai title for the second time in three years with a week to spare thanks to his four wins this season, including major titles in the Open at Royal Liverpool and US PGA Championship at Valhalla.
