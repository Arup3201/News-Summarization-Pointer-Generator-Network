A paper wrist strap similar to the bands worn at festivals can help prevent over-exposure to the sun and reduce the risk of cancer.

The device lets people know when they have been exposed to a certain amount of UV (ultra-violet) radiation by changing colour.

The monitor works by changing colour from yellow to pink as the strength of UV radiation increases.

The wristbands change colour when the sun's UV rays can start to cause damage

It operates through an acid-release agent
 which picks up ultraviolet light and a dye which responds to pH levels 
in the indicator.

The agent is decomposed by sunlight, leading to the 
rapid change in colour.

The bands will be tailored to different skin types to reflect the different tolerance levels that people have to the sun.

For example, a band for someone with fair hair and light skin will change colour quicker than a band for someone with dark hair and dark skin.

The technology will be commercialised by Swedish-based company Intellego Technologies, established by Swedish entrepreneur Claes Lindahl.

'We are very excited 
about the UV dosimeter technology and we look forward to developing it 
further and commercialising it,' said Lindahl.

'There
 is a substantial need out in the market for a functional UV dosimeter 
and we look forward to continuing the process.'

Professor Andrew Mills and Dr Michael McFarlane are both responsible for the original invention and were previously with the University’s Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry.

They will now be engaged as consultants to Intellego Technologies.

Mills said: 'The bands will have to cost less than 10p each because they are disposable and need to be thrown away at the end of the day.

Prolonged exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer, of which the most virulent form, malignant melanoma, had 200,000 new cases worldwide in 2008, according to Cancer Research UK statistics.

The new technology can alert sunbathers when UV levels are becoming harmful

'The sunburn monitor will make a significant contribution to public health as an affordable, fashionable device which enables people to enjoy the benefits of the sun while at the same time keeping them alert to the risks of over- exposure.' said Fiona Strang, Commercialisation Manager with the University of Strathclyde’s Research & Knowledge Exchange Services.

The development of the device received initial funding and support from Scottish Enterprise's Proof of Concept fund.
