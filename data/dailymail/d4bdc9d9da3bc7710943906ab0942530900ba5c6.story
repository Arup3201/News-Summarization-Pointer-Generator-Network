Dirty Tricks: A secret Conservative Party report has exposed a campaign designed to oust Anne Mcintosh from her safe seat before the next election

The Conservative Party is facing ‘its 
own Falkirk crisis’ – after a dirty tricks campaign designed to oust an 
MP from her seat before the election was exposed in a secret report.

Thirsk
 and Malton MP Anne McIntosh, who counts David Cameron among her 
supporters, has been fighting a long-running battle with senior Tories 
in her constituency who would like to see her deselected.

One
 of the only female Tory MPs in the North of England, the MP’s backers 
have claimed that her detractors resent being represented by a woman.

And a leaked report has now revealed 
that local officials broke the party’s rules before staging a ‘flawed’ 
deselection vote – with the dispute compared to the Falkirk vote-rigging
 row which tore the Labour Party apart last year.

Miss
 McIntosh, who has a majority of 11,000, first survived a deselection 
vote in 2009 when party members opted to keep her as their MP.

However,
 in January 2013 she had to face another attempted coup, after the local
 Conservative Association’s executive committee took on a significant 
number of new members shortly before holding a vote to decide the MP’s 
future.

The ‘wrongly’ expanded committee decided not to reselect Miss McIntosh, but the move sparked uproar in the rural community.

A
 petition supporting the MP was quickly handed in to officials at the 
party’s headquarters, who decided to order an inquiry into the row.

The
 inquiry’s findings were initially suppressed but the resulting report 
has now been published online by one of the MP’s disgruntled supporters.

The report rejected claims
 that she had failed to communicate with local party officials saying 
there was ‘no evidence she neglected her duties’.

It
 also hinted that, by breaking the rules on new committee members – 
which are designed to prevent ‘an unrepresentative takeover’ – local 
party officials had attempted to fix the deselection vote.

It
 singled out constituency chairman Peter Steveney – an opponent of the 
MP – saying he behaved ‘unfairly’ towards Miss McIntosh.

As
 a result of the inquiry, party chiefs ordered the deselection  decision
 to be declared null and void and the executive committee to be reformed
 in accordance with the party’s rules.

‘It is a sad fact that those principles 
and traditional values for which I stand are not so prized today by some
 as they once were by all true blue Conservatives.'

The
 deselection vote is now being held again, although this time all 560 
local party members will be balloted on whether to keep the 59-year-old 
MP, with the results due to be announced on Friday.

Describing
 the affair as ‘our very own Falkirk’ the MP’s supporters believe that 
the ‘old-fashioned’ party officials – led by 78-year-old retired army 
major Mr Steveney – were unhappy that they were being represented by a 
woman.

Miss McIntosh has 
refused to comment on the report’s findings, but earlier this month 
wrote to members to deliver a thinly-veiled attack on her critics.

She
 wrote in the letter: ‘It is a sad fact that those principles and 
traditional values for which I stand are not so prized today by some as 
they once were by all true blue Conservatives. As an MP I have to help 
the many, not just the few.’

Miss
 McIntosh has been an MP since 1997.

She speaks five languages and is 
chairman of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee.

A 
Tory Party spokesman refused to comment.
