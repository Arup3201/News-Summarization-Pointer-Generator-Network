Mugged: Jose Mourinho's wife Tami (above pictured in 2010) and daughter Tita were targeted by thieves at the five-star Wyndham Grand Hotel in Chelsea

Former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho’s wife and daughter were targeted by thieves in their luxury London hotel room, it was revealed today,

The current Real Madrid boss flew in from Spain to comfort his wife Matilde, 47, who is better known as Tami, and daughter Tita, 16, after they had a laptop stolen from the five-star Wyndham Grand Hotel in Chelsea.

The pair checked into a suite costing up to £1,044-a-night because the teenager had enrolled onto a fine art course at the capital's Camberwell College of Arts.

They decided to go into a hotel 
despite the 'special one', who is widely tipped to take over again at 
Chelsea next season, still owning a house nearby.

Today Scotland Yard confirmed that officers were investigating the burglary, which happened at 11pm on March 27.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 
‘Police were called at 11.04pm on Wednesday March 27th to a burglary at a
room in the Wyndham Grand Hotel in Chelsea.

‘Officers from Hammersmith and Fulham CID are investigating.’

The
Wyndham Grand said it could not comment on the break-in while the 
investigation was ongoing, but manager Xavier Montembault said: 'We 
take the safety and security of our guests very seriously.'

Mourinho’s 
family have been targeted by burglars before, when a Macedonian gang 
tracked his movements in a plot to raid his Italian villa in Como two 
years ago.  But police foiled them.

Chelsea are understood to have spoken to an adviser close to Malaga coach Manuel Pellegrini about taking over in the summer, although Jose Mourinho remains the favourite to return to Stamford Bridge.

The majority of the Chelsea board are still backing Mourinho’s appointment, but owner Roman Abramovich is understood to have slight doubts, particularly with regard to the Real Madrid coach's exorbitant wage demands.
