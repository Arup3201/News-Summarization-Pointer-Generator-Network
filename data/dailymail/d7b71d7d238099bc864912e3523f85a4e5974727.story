Lance Armstrong appeared at an event for his Livestrong charity on Sunday as the bullying tactics used to intimidate his opponents were exposed.

The Annual Team Livestrong Challenge opened in Austin, Texas, with some 4,000 cyclists setting out to ride 18, 65 or 100 miles in a show of support for cancer survivors.

But behind the scenes the bribery-and-doping scandal surrounding Armstrong continues.

Members of the cycling community have described the difficulty they faced in standing up to Armstrong and tell the truth in the doping scandal.

So powerful a figure was Armstrong within his sport that for years they felt too paranoid to come forward, frightened that their reputations would be damaged.

Since then many victims have broken their silence, including Betsy Andreu, the wife of a former Armstrong teammate.

She described receiving a voicemail from an Armstrong friend telling her she hoped 'somebody breaks a baseball bat over your head,' after her husband spoke out about doping allegations.

At the time, victims told the New York Daily News, the feared voicing allegations against Armstrong would lead to being accused of being jealous, unpatriotic or even drunk.

But now they are following the lead of Frankie and Betsy Andreu and Greg and Kathy LeMond, who were among the first to speak out.

'I wanted to show what kind of treatment we were getting,' Mrs Andreu told the Daily News after the series of abusive voicemails were published in 2010.

'When I got those phone calls, I was worried on one hand and disgusted on the other.'

In a separate incidents Mrs LeMond told how Armstrong offered to pay $300,000 to a former teammates to claim that he had seen LeMond using an oxygen-boosting drug.

'It shows how desperate Lance was,' she said. 'It is a huge example of what a bully Lance Armstrong is. He crosses lines no others will cross.'

Armstrong has been 
turned into an outcast in professional cycling and most of his personal 
sponsors dropped him this week after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency 
released a massive report detailing performance-enhancing drug use by 
the seven-time Tour de France winner.

USADA has ordered him banned from 
cycling for life and stripped of his Tour de France victories.

The man who led the anti-doping investigation, USADA CEO Travis Tygart, has often spoken of the same motivation and he has paid a price to come this far.

He previously said he was the target of death threats; he has been a constant target of Armstrong and his attorneys, who have called his mission a "witch hunt" and worse.

He persevered, explaining: 'I've heard the stories from the athletes. I've heard them from the clean athletes who left their sport and felt personally robbed.'

Tygart insisted he treated Armstrong the same as any other cyclist in his investigation but Armstrong sees things differently.

'This isn't about Tygart wanting to clean up cycling,' he wrote in a letter to The Associated Press. 'Rather it's just a plain ol' selective prosecution that reeks of vendetta.'

Speaking on Friday in his opening remarks at Livestrong's 15th 
anniversary celebration, Armstrong said 
he had been through a 'difficult couple of weeks' and urged supporters 
of his cancer-fighting charity to stand behind its mission.

'The
mission is bigger than me. It's bigger than any individual,' he said.

Dark Days: Lance Armstrong, seen here during a conference last August in Montreal, celebrated Livestrong's 15th anniversary Friday night as new allegations surfaced about offering $50,000 bribes to fellow cyclists.

Survivors: Armstrong is joined him are members of Livestrong's staff, many of whom are cancer survivors. Armstrong said he has been through a "difficult couple of weeks."

Meanwhile, reports surfaced that Armstrong offered bribes to a cycling opponent to throw a race back in 1993.

The Australian Broadcasting Corp. uncovered court documents indicating that Lance Armstrong offered to bribe other cyclists at a group of races back in 1993, including one in Philly.

New Zealand cyclist Steven Swart gave a sworn deposition during a 2006 lawsuit involving Armstrong where he alleged that Armstrong offered an opponent $50,000 to help fix the CoreStates U.S. Pro Cycling race in Philadelphia as well as events in Pittsburgh and West Virginia.

Armstrong,
who denies doping, didn't address the USADA report or the doping 
charges in his remarks Friday night. Instead, he focused on the mission of the 
foundation he started in 1997.

Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with 
testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain.

'I
am ... truly humbled by your support,' Armstrong said after receiving a
standing ovation from the crowd of 1,700. 'It's been an interesting 
couple of weeks. It's been a difficult couple of weeks for me and my 
family, my friends and this foundation.'

Armstrong said he's been asked many times how he is doing.

'I
say, `I've been better, but I've also been worse,'' said Armstrong, 
making his first public appearance since the USADA report was released 
last week.

Guests Arrive: Robin Williams and Norah Jones were among the guests who attended the 15th anniversary celebration gala of Livestrong, Lance Armstrong's cancer-fighting charity.

On Monday, the International Cycling Union is expected to announce whether it will appeal USADA's sanctions.

The
celebration gala came two days after Armstrong stepped down as chairman
of Livestrong to help shield the charity from the fallout of the 
controversy swirling around him. He remains on the board of directors.

Armstrong urged the crowd to continue fighting to help cancer patients and survivors.

Celebrity Cause: Actor Sean Penn arrives on the yellow carpet for the "An Evening with Livestrong" gala fundraising event in Austin, Texas.

'There's 28 million people around the world living with this disease,' Armstrong said. 'Thank you for your support.'

Livestrong
officials expected to raise $2.5 million from the event, which included
appearances by actors Sean Penn and Robin Williams and singer Norah 
Jones.

Armstrong won the Tour de France every 
year from 1999-2005 and his success on the bike helped propel the 
foundation into one of the most popular and well-known charities in the 
country. Livestrong has raised about $500 million in the fight against 
cancer.

In 2004, the foundation introduced the
yellow 'Livestrong' bracelets, selling more than 80 million and 
creating a global symbol for cancer awareness and survival.

The
silent auction included two Trek bicycles valued up to $12,000 - Trek 
was one of the companies that dropped Armstrong as a sponsor on 
Wednesday - and seven autographed yellow jerseys Armstrong wore on the 
podium during his Tour de France victories.

Gerry
Goldstein, a criminal defense attorney and friend of Armstrong for 
several years, criticized USADA's investigation and sanctions of 
Armstrong.

Drug testers never caught Armstrong when he was competing, Goldstein said.

'I'm
a big fan of what he has done. Overcoming cancer and doing what he did,
who gives a (expletive) about anything else? That's so much more 
important as a role model and a human being,' Goldstein said. 'Quit 
whining about it.'

Kansas City Royals pitcher 
Jeremy Guthrie, who donated a pair of cleats to the silent auction, said
he wants to continue supporting Livestrong.

Stepping Down: Armstrong resigned as head of the Livestrong Foundation this week. as a new report shows that he and his team used performance drugs.

'Obviously,
some things have a left a little scar, but people think it's still 
important to come out and support Livestrong,' Guthrie said.

The
charity has worked hard to separate its mission of fighting cancer from
Armstrong's troubles, said Doug Ulman, Livestrong president and chief 
executive.

Although Armstrong lost many of his
personal sponsorship contracts, Nike, Anheuser-Busch and others who 
said they were terminating their contracts or would not renew them 
because of the doping evidence, said they would keep supporting 
Livestrong.

'We're proud of our history and 
we're excited to celebrate. We've heard from so many grass-roots 
supporters, program partners, corporate partners and a lot of them are 
doubling down, saying they are going to come back even stronger in 
2013,' Ulman said.
