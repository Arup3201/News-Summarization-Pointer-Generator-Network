In a blow to potential Premier League suitors Manchester City, Diego Simeone is in talks to extend his contract at Atletico Madrid until 2022.

The Argentine manager's sister Natalia Simeone, who handles his contractual affairs, has been in the Spanish capital for the last 10 days to discuss terms of a proposed new deal.

The reigning La Liga champions, who recently sold a 20 per cent stake in the club to the Dalian Wanda group, are interested in tying down the highly sought after manager on a seven-year deal, according to Spanish daily AS.

7 - After just nine years in management Simeone has already won seven major honours — including La Liga, the Copa del Rey and Europa League.

64.3 - His win percentage in his three-and-a-half seasons as Atletico manager.

4 - The number of times Simeone’s Atletico have beaten arch-rivals Real Madrid this season. They have also had two draws.

Among the clauses being negotiated is giving Simeone complete control over player signings in a bid to offer the 44-year-old longevity.

The former Argentina international has been a revelation at the Vicente Calderon, winning the Spanish league title and reaching the Champions League final before losing to city rivals Real Madrid last season.

Premier League champions City had been linked with Simeone amid growing concern over their faltering season, which has seen them eliminated from both domestic cup competitions and trail league leaders Chelsea by seven points.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini's future at the Etihad could be decided by their progress in the Champions League where they face Barcelona in their last 16 first-leg on Tuesday after scraping through to the knockout stage.

Should Pellegrini leave, Simeone would be top of the oil rich club's wishlist since both Carlo Ancelotti and Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola are less likely to leave their clubs while Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp is having a poor season.

Despite condemning Real Madrid 4-0 recently, a 2-0 defeat to Celta Vigo in their next match has left Atletico seven points off the title race with the manager claiming that the club's priority is only to finish third ahead of the weekend's game against Almeria.

'I am convinced that this is our target. Our objective is (qualifying for) the Champions League and our rivals are Valencia and Sevilla. Possibly also Villarreal as they are playing well and have grown a lot,' he said.
