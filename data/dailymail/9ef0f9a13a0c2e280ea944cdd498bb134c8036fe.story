Fire stations across the country are in financial limbo as they wait for the IRS ruling on whether they have to provide volunteer firefighters medical insurance under Obamacare.

According to the Affordable Health Care Act, businesses with more than 50 full-time employees are required to provide health insurance for them, a full-time employee defined as someone who works over 30 hours a week.

Pennsylvania Representative Lou Barletta, a Republican, says that having to provide insuance will 'threaten public safety' by putting 'unbearable financial burdens' on already cash-strapped stations.

Rep Barletta along with Mark Warner, the Democratic Senator from Virginia, are sponsoring legislation to exempt volunteer fire, medical and rescue personnel from full-time status.

'This is just another example of how Obamacare was not well thought out,' Rep Barletta said on December 11 while introducing the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. 'So, we're left to try to pave over the potholes. And this is a big one - possibly affecting fire stations nationwide.'

Rep Barletta says the broad definition of full-time employee is hard to apply to a fire station staff.

'Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone?' Barletta asks. 'Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner? These are all legimimate questions raised since ObamaCare has been forced on Americans.'

Rep Barletta wrote to the IRS in November asking for clarifications on whether the new legislation applies to these volunteer workers but they have not given an official ruling yet.

'We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer provision, 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code,' Treasury spokeswoman Victoria Esser told The Patriot-News. 'Pending issuance of the final reulations, it would bot be appropriate for us to comment on their likely content.'

No matter what the decision, the stations won't have to provide insurance until 2015, since the 'employer mandate' part of the act was delayed to give officials more time to work out the regulations.Â
