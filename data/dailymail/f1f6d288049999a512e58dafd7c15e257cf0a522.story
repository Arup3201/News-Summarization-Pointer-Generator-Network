The family of the real-life Aunt Jemima is suing the company that made her face synonymous with breakfast for $2billion.

D.W. Hunter is the great-grandson of Anna Short Harrington, whose pancake recipe reportedly earned her the honor of becoming the Aunt Jemima mascot in 1935, and says hi family royalties that the company knowingly withheld for over 75 years.

He is suing Quaker Oats, its parent company Pepsico and other companies related to the brand on behalf of all Harrington's great grandchildren.

A real Aunt Jemima? Aunt Jemima was reportedly based on Anna Short Harrington, but her family says no one has seen a dime since her death in 1955

The Chicago Tribune reports that Hunter wants punitive damages--to be determined at trial--in addition to the $2billion in royalties not paid to the family after Harrington's death in 1955.

The suit alleges that Quaker et al have conspired to withhold information about Harrington's status as a Quaker Oats employee and that they simultaneously exploited her image and recipes for years.

The suit alleges the companies claimed to have no record of Harrington's employment or any images of her but that they, however, kept a photograph of her with the U.S. Patent Office.

The family says Quaker stole 64 original formulas and 22 menus from Harrington and accuses the company of having a 'racial element' in their exploitation of women since Aunt Jemima debuted in the 1880s.

The suit even claims that Quaker used the likeness of Harrington's youngest daughter Olivia Hunter to update Aunt Jemima in 1989.
