Loyalists in Northern Ireland celebrated the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne at midnight by lighting hundreds of bonfires across the city.

The celebration, known as Eleventh Night, prompted one call every 77 seconds at its peak to the fire brigade as crowds burned piles of wood and furniture.

Elsewhere, a member of the nationalist SDLP party claimed a death threat against him had been burned on a bonfire in County Londonderry.

Stormont Assembly member John Dallat 
said police warned him of the sinister message in Garvagh, which said 
life would not be normal until he was disposed of.

Mr Dallat said that police had been 
unable to persuade organisers of the bonfire to remove a scarf in the 
shape of a noose that was on display.

Hundreds of bonfires, including this one in the Sandy Row area of Belfast, were lit across Northern Ireland overnight to commemorate Eleventh Night

'When I visited Garvagh just before midnight, it was very clear that the number of people turning out to support this event was a mere handful compared to years ago,' he said.

'Clearly the people of Garvagh have had enough of the wanton sectarianism that has being going on in the name of loyalism and they don't find it appealing or entertaining.'

He added: 'While the death threat won't inhibit me in any way, I do take note that those involved are dangerous people who can't be ignored and should not be ignored because they have the capacity to attract the interest of loyalist paramilitaries who over the years claimed the lives of many people in East Derry.'

SDLP member John Dallat said that death threats had been made against him in the bonfires

Eleventh Night is a reference to the evening before July 12, the day when Protestants commemorate the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.

The celebration marks the defeat of 
the Catholic King James, by the Protestant William of Orange, 
which was one of the major turning points in Irish history.

The annual demonstration sees 
thousands of Orange Order members and bandsmen join parades across 
Northern Ireland, which have sparked serious rioting and violence in recent years between loyalists and nationalists.

A total of 550
parades were due to take place throughout Northern Ireland today.

Firefighters attended some blazes to 
cool down nearby homes to protect them from the fierce heat, with 42 of 
the 184 calls on the night related to the event.

One fire crew had to withdraw from a 
bonfire in Craigavon, County Armagh, after youths threw stones at them, 
though nobody was injured.

A blaze at Cluan Place, east Belfast, near where serious 
sectarian rioting has broken out in the past, caused some minor external damage to a nearby building.

The
Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said only 15 calls required 
help from its crews, who also attended 25 minor gorse and grass fires.

The victory of William of Orange, marked in the Protestant Sandy Row area of Belfast, is a significant point in Irish history

The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service received one call every 77 seconds at the height of activity last night

The 184 calls was almost double the number received on the same night last year, the service said.

More than 40 displays have been deemed to be contentious by authorities, resulting in hundreds of extra police 
officers been drafted on to the streets.

In recent years police 
officers have been battered with bricks, bottles and petrol bombs. Last year shots were also fired and a pipe bomb hurled at police lines in the Ardoyne.

Unionist
anger has intensified in recent days over a decision to ban an Orange 
Order parade past a sectarian flash point at Ardoyne.

The Parades Commission adjudication 
body banned Orangemen from taking the same route past shops in Ardoyne 
on their return journey in 
the afternoon.

The area has been the scene of intense rioting on July 12 in recent years.

The Orange Order branded the commission's decision 'ludicrous' but urged supporters not to react with violence.

The decision by the Commission was the
first time it ruled that the Orange Order cannot hold an evening 
parade past Ardoyne.

It came after intensive talks with nationalist 
residents failed to reach agreement.

At the Battle of the Boyne about
36,000 troops commanded by King William III defeated an army of 25,000 troops led by King James II along the river Boyne 
near the town of Drogheda on the Irish east coast.

The victory of William, a Protestant, over
the forces of England's Catholic king created a Protestant ascendancy 
in the Emerald Isle - most notably in the Ulster region.

William
and his wife Mary II jointly reigned over England, Scotland and 
Ireland. Their reign saw the end of fears that England would return to 
Catholicism, as James wanted. There has not been a Roman Catholic 
monarch since.

The
battle took place on July 1 in the Julian calendar, which is equivalent
to July 11 in the Gregorian calendar in use today, while the celebration is held each 
year on the 12th.

Some of the bonfires, such as this one in New Mossley, Belfast, reached as high as 100ft
