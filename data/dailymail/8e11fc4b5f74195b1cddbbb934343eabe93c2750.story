Challenges: Dr Nathalie MacDemott, pictured before she returned to Liberia to treat Ebola patients

British Ebola doctor Nathalie MacDermott made headlines when she returned to Liberia despite previously fearing she had contracted the disease.

Now the 32-year-old, who quarantined herself in her Cardiff flat for three weeks, has sent back a diary which lays bare the chaos and confusion which treating the outbreak involves.

More than 7,500 people have died of Ebola in West Africa since the disease broke out in March this year, and almost 20,000 people have been infected.

The vast majority of infections have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and Liberia has had the worst death toll at almost half the victims.

However, case rates have been declining in Liberia since the middle of last month according to the World Health Organization, which is hopeful of its demise. 

Despite the grim figures, Dr MacDermott is surprisingly optimistic - and insists the prospect of the disease being wiped out in Liberia in 2015 is a reality.

There has recently been a suspect case in Greenville, who unfortunately despite many agencies' best efforts, including our own, has disappeared and refused to be tested for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).

We arranged for his transport to the Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Bong County, but he declined to go. He then stopped answering his phone and we were no longer able to trace him as he had left the village and disappeared somewhere in Bong County. 

This makes the decision to remove the team difficult. If he was a confirmed case he may well have infected other people in the town as he also refused to fully isolate himself.

However if he was not a case then we are retaining our team in a very challenging environment for several weeks longer than needed.

We eventually manage to get hold of him and he hangs up the phone on me when I offer to arrange an ambulance to take him to get a blood test done.

We manage to determine though from community leaders that he seems much better and so it is less likely he has EVD. We make a decision to pull our team out but regularly monitor the situation.

December 15-18

Over the course of the next few days I am largely based in the office in Monrovia. I hear news of a suspect case in Lofa county. This is concerning as Lofa county has just passed 42 days clear of any cases of Ebola. The potential case lives very close to the border with Guinea and Sierra Leone and there is concern he has travelled there. Fortunately the case turns out to be a false alarm.

We are preparing to travel to Zorzor tomorrow for the official opening of our Community Care Centre (CCC) when we learn that several of our staff have been in a car accident.

They were driving to Monrovia in convoy from our base in Fish Town, River Gee County. Unfortunately one of the vehicles has been in a head-on collision with another vehicle.

We learn that four of our staff are injured, two of them severely injured. They are at a small health centre in a village in the middle of the jungle.

The nearest town is over an hour's drive on very poor roads. One of our staff members is unconscious, the other is unable to move her neck and has chest injuries. 

We are unable to get any further information. I am concerned that both of them could have injuries to their necks and that if they are not immobilised prior to transfer they could be permanently paralysed if they are moved.

We attempt to request a helicopter but we are told they are not allowed to transport Liberians.

This decision cuts deep. If this was one of my US or British colleagues, there would be no hesitation to use one of the five helicopters currently sitting on the tarmac at the airport. But somehow because they are Liberian, they are not entitled to the same treatment I would be.

To me they are my colleagues, whether they are Liberian, American or British, and I will do my best for them however I can.

With tears in my eyes I make the decision not to move them that night. It is a horrible decision to make. The health centre they are in has no facilities, but I understand they are both relatively stable. 

My concern that I could do them more damage by requesting they be moved by people inexperienced in manual handling. I go to bed that night praying it was not the wrong decision.

Waiting game: United Nations helicopters are in short supply, and getting one is far from guaranteed

It is a miracle we had a UN helicopter scheduled today to take us to Zorzor. This has enabled us to re-schedule this helicopter to take us to Tapetta to collect my colleagues instead.

We arrive in Tapetta and the pilots tell us they will wait for us for a maximum of three hours. It is an hours drive to Toe, the village where my colleagues are.

We race along the dirt track trying to save as much time as possible. We know that time will be short when we arrive to immobilise them both and get them into the back of our land cruiser.

I don't have everything I need, but I at least have two neck collars to stabilise their necks and two decent combat stretchers. It is the best I can do.

We leave Toe with only 50 minutes until the helicopter will leave and once again race along the dirt track. This time the driver tries to be even more cautious about avoiding the pot holes, after all we have two colleagues on stretchers in the back of our land cruiser with the sideways fitted seats pushed upwards out of the way.

We make it back to the helicopter 10 minutes late, but fortunately they have waited for us. 

X-rays confirm I was right to have been concerned for one of my colleagues. Fortunately both of them do well and are discharged home from hospital a few days later. 

Finally I am able to get some time off. It has been three weeks with no day off and two medical evacuations, which are pretty exhausting in the current context. On Sunday evening we go carol singing and take some baked items to the neighbouring houses on the compound.

December 22

We are taking over a transit centre that has been converted following the closure of the ETU in Foya. A transit centre is similar to a CCC but patients will only remain for a few days until we have determined if they have a positive test for Ebola or not.

I visit the facility today but unfortunately there is a lot more work to do on the lay out and the water source so we will not be opening the facility before New Year as we had hoped.

Today I spend time responding to emails and trying to resolve issues regarding staff contracts. I then attend a meeting regarding the CCCs that are being constructed by UNICEF, of which we will take over the coordination of three facilities when they are completed in January.

December 24

I spend a part of the day baking cookies to take to the medical staff at the medical facility set up by the USPHS for Liberian and International health care workers who contract EVD.

They had kindly lent us two combat stretchers last week when we evacuated my two colleagues and so we wanted to thank them and wish them a Merry Christmas.

In the evening we go out for a team meal that the charity Samaritan's Purse has kindly offered to pay for.

It is a moment of normality amidst the chaos where we all dress up and feel relatively smart for the first time in weeks.

December 25

Whilst we will continue to work we do ensure the entire team takes the day off today. The only staff working are the health care workers who are staffing our two functioning CCCs.

Our international team share brunch together. Then we do a gift exchange and go for a swim in the ocean.

The obligatory drone of Chinooks and Black Hawk helicopters throughout the day reminds us of the ongoing battle we find ourselves in.

December 26

It is back to work today but as there are not many meetings this week and many people are not working there is a limit to what can be done.

I am hoping to make these few days a little bit easier and to complete all the formal documentation I have been unable to do due to all of my other responsibilities over the last few weeks.

I remain hopeful that we will see the end of Ebola in Liberia in the next few months. Numbers continue to remain down, although there was a small increase in cases again last week.

As long as there is no peak following the Christmas period, an Ebola-free Liberia really could be a possibility in a few months' time. 

Then more attention can be focused on Sierra Leone and Guinea. Here is to a 2015 where the largest Ebola epidemic in history is brought to an end.
