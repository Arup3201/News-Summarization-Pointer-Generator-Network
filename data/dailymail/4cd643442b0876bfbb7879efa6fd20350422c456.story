This is the first picture of a woman, Nari, believed to have been murdered by fugitive Briton Stuart Green

This is the first picture of the woman believed to have been murdered by fugitive Briton Stuart Green, who is being hunted by police in Cambodia.

The photo, posted on an expatriate forum by a writer using the name Ross, said the woman was named Nari and was 'a nice girl'. Police have so far refused to formally identify the dead woman.

Other writers on the website said they recognised her face, although some questioned how 'Ross' knew she was the woman who allegedly had her throat cut by 47-year-old Green, from Manchester.

Police said a Cambodian woman aged about 20 had been found naked under the bed in a room at a Phnom Penh hotel which Green and the woman had checked into on Christmas day.

The Briton asked for the return of his passport at around 11pm on the night of December 28, telling reception staff that he needed it to go to a bank to get money to pay for the room - even though banks were not open at that time of night.

He left the hotel and never returned. The following morning a cleaner found the blood-covered body under the bed.

Since then there has been no sign of Green, with expatriates speculating that he might have been able to cross a 'loosely-guarded' border into a neighbouring country - most likely Thailand.

Others have suggested he is hiding out in a remote 'flophouse' or a village where locals do not know that police are looking for him.

One of the writers said he was certain that the woman whose photo has been posted was the local known as Nari.

He wrote: 'My information was that the police did take a girl over from Sorya Mall (a shopping area where Nari is said to have associated with Western men) and she did identify the body.'

If the dead woman is indeed Nari, she appears to have been liked by a number of expatriates.

One writer commented: 'I didn't know her and I wish she'd had a different lifestyle and life opportunities, but I do hope they capture the bastard who killed her.'

A correspondent using the name Chicorytip wrote: 'Yes, that's the girl. She was a bit crazy in a sweet and funny way. She was a good person.

'I remember her bringing her pet rabbit to the White Cobra bar. RIP.'

Despite demands from expatriates, Phnom Penh police have still failed to issue even a passport photo of Green.
