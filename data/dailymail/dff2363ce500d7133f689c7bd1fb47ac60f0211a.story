Burned, in pain, and close to death: that is how  Cinder the black bear was discovered in the aftermath of the largest forest fire ever to rip through Washington state last year.

Trapped among the flames she had somehow managed to survive, but had suffered third degree burns to all four of her paws that meant she was reduced to crawling along on her elbows.

But now thanks to the efforts of staff at Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care she is getting ready to be released back into the wild after making a full recovery.

Burned: Cinder was found crawling on her elbows after her feet were badly burned during the largest forest fire to ever hit Washington state last year

Suffering: If left on her own she would have suffered a slow an inevitable death, but was instead flown to Lake Tahoe to a rescue centre where they went about nursing her back to health

Wounded: When Cinder arrived at the centre she was under weight, badly burned and close to death. But now she is almost ready to be released back into the wild

In July 2014 three separate forest fires all caused by lightening strikes converged in the Carlton Complex area of Washington, reducing more than 250,000 acres of forest to ashes.

The flames burned for more than a week, creating the biggest forest fire the state had ever seen, taking more than 3,000 fire fighters to bring it under control.

Care: Staff at the centre are specialists in treating bears less than one year old. Cinder was aged just nine months when she was brought in 

An estimated 300 houses were burned to the ground around Pateros and Malott, and it was here that a homeowner discovered Cinder after returning to inspect the ruins of their property.

The 18-month-old cub was severely injured, badly underweight, and in so much pain she couldn't stand up. Left on her own, she would have died a slow, painful and inevitable death.

But instead rescue workers used a sedative to knock her out, before flying her more than more than 800 miles to Lake Tahoe in neighbouring California.

Once there specialist staff at the LTWC began working on nursing her back to full health. 

Tom Millham, the secretary of LTWC, said: 'Fortunately, when Cinder came to us in August everything came together.

'Dr Kevin Willetts – our voluntary veterinarian – took over as he has over 30 years' experience of dealing with our major medical emergencies.

'Cinder was already a wild bear which meant we didn't have to do too much rehabilitation. It was all about the medical care for her.

'From the day she came in we had her set up on an every other day treatment where we changed the dressings on her wounds.

'For over six weeks we changed the dressings every other day and then we increased the time between them.

'From September 30 we stopped putting dressings on her feet to let them heal on their own.'

After her wounds had healed she was transferred to the Idaho Black Bear Centre in Idaho, where she is now going through the last phase of her healing process before going back to nature.

She has been placed next to another one year old cub to get her used to other bears and is spending time outside to get her paws used to the cold weather.

On the mend: Cinder has now put on weight, regrown her scorched fur, and had almost all of the bandages removed from her feet, and is getting ready to be returned to the wild

Alone: It is believed that Cinders' mother died in the forest fire, so she has been placed with other bears at a rescue centre to get her used to their company before she is released

Mr Millham added: 'Our normal procedure means we knock out the bear to make it easier for her to move them. She was out within a few minutes and then we put her on a stretcher to weigh her.

'Her weight tripled in the time we looked after her from 39lbs - which is really light for a second year cub. We weighed her the other day she was 97lbs with a really fat stomach which is good for her.

'We're really pleased with the progress she has made. She was a perfect lady on the trip – she barely made a sound on the drive.

'Bears will normally sleep for that long, but she kept herself busy with a toy and she had her favourite grapes to feed on.

Treatment: Staff at Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care dress Cinders' wounds as they nurse her back to health

Recovery: After being treated in Tahoe, Cinders was moved to the Idaho Black Bear Centre where she is currently waiting to be released back into the Washington wild

'Once we got to Idaho it took her a matter of seconds to pop her head out and explore her new surrounds. We're so happy with the way she's healed.'

Tom and his wife Cheryl set up LTWC in 1978 after attending a wildlife seminar and have helped heal more than 20,000 animals in their 36 year history.

The animal charity is the only certified wildlife centre to rehabilitate bear cubs under one year in the state of California.
