In the three months since Celtic and Rangers were first paired in the Scottish League Cup semi finals, the increasingly frenzied debate in the divided city of Glasgow has been about whether the ‘Old Firm’ still exists.

And as Celtic brushed aside their old foes easily 2-0 at Hampden Park this afternoon - in the first meeting of the teams since April 2012 - the green and white hordes were not slow in informing their rivals in blue that their club ‘died’ when liquidation was visited upon Ibrox three years ago.

Yet while they may have been at odds over the ‘Old Firm’ issue, by full time in this embarrassingly one-sided encounter, both sets of rival supporters would surely have been united in the view that this Rangers team is indisputably infirm.

A pale shadow of great Ibrox teams of the past, despite the second biggest budget in the land, Kenny McDowall’s pedestrian and deeply unimpressive side failed to register a shot of any description until a high and wide effort by Lee Wallace on 71 minutes. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon had not a single save to make.

Celtic, frankly, were streets ahead of Rangers but settled for first half goals from Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons as Ronny Deila’s men booked their place against Dundee United in next month’s final.

After going ahead, Deila’s men largely played within themselves, to the annoyance of Celtic fans, who sensed an opportunity to outstrip their biggest-ever win in the fixture: ‘Hampden in the Sun’, Celtic 7 Rangers 1 in the League Cup Final on October 19, 1957.

It was no surprise that this was such a mismatch, though. Celtic lead the Scottish Premiership while Rangers trail Hearts by 16 points in the Championship. Off the park chaos continues to dog Rangers, who went into yesterday’s match with caretaker manager Kenny McDowall still in the dugout despite handing in his notice last month – following in the footsteps of Ally McCoist who did likewise in November.

Indeed, such is the weakened state of Rangers that cheers rang out from the Celtic dressing room when the semi final draw was made. Everything added up to a comfortable win in Ronny Deila’s first Old Firm match and that’s exactly what unfolded here at the National Stadium.

After a cagey start, Griffiths justified his place in the starting line-up over John Guidetti – the on-loan Manchester City forward who publicly stated he fancied scoring a hat-trick against Rangers.

Deila had waxed lyrical last week about Griffiths’ ‘world class’ left foot but he used his head here. Stefan Johansen floated over a cross from the right, Rangers defender Darren McGregor got caught under the ball and Griffiths stooped to silence the Rangers end.

Police Scotland visited both squads last week ahead of this powderkeg tie to urge players to be on their best behaviour but Griffiths ignored them, cupping his ears at the Rangers fans and picking up a booking.

Chants by Celtic fans of: “You’re not Rangers anymore” were immediately replaced by “Can you hear the Rangers sing?”

Rangers had not played a full 90 minutes since January 10 when they won 1-0 at Alloa Athletic, and they looked rusty and devoid of any attacking ideas. And on the rare occasion they did make it up the park, winger Fraser Aird wastefully and woefully overhit a corner kick.

At the other end, Anthony Stokes saw a fierce drive dip narrowly over the crossbar before Commons made it 2-0. Tenacious play on the edge of the Rangers box by captain Scott Brown ended with Commons lashing a fierce drive high beyond Simonsen and into the back of the net.

Rangers had referee Craig Thompson to thank when he bizarrely called back play for a foul on Brown by Ian Black when Griffiths was haring through on goal. And it took a good close-range save from Simonson to stop Johansen making it 3-0 by the break.

The second half started with the same Celtic domination, with Griffiths firing a long-range freekick wide. But as the clock ran down, Deila’s men looked increasingly content to sit on their 2-0 lead against toothless opponents.

The last whistle brought confirmation of Celtic’s place in the final as they aim for their first League Cup success since 2009. But Dundee United – who knocked out holders Aberdeen 2-1 in Saturday’s semi final – will provide a far stiffer test than Rangers offered here
