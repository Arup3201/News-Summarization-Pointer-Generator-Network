Alaska will soon begin providing free pregnancy tests to women in bar bathrooms.

The new program was birthed by Republican Senator Pete Kelly to help fight fetal alcohol syndrome, he said earlier this year – but is against the state providing contraception in a similar manner.

The University of Alaska is spearheading the effort in an attempt to lower Alaska’s highest-in-the-nation rate of the devastating affliction.

Man with a plan: Senator Pete Kelly (R-AK) first proposed the program back in March

Kelly raised more than a few eyebrows when he first proposed the idea in March, but it has received significant backing.

Lawmakers have approved a two-year, $400,000 pilot to determine how effective such a strategy is, according to the Anchorage Daily News.

Tests will be made available in 20 bars across the state as early as December, but contraception will notably be absent.

Kelly says the tests are to alert women in the early stages of pregnancy to make a more educated decision about whether to drink or not – 20 per cent of Alaskan women binge drink during their pregnancies, according to the state.

‘This assumes that if you know (you are pregnant) you’ll act responsibly,’ Kelly said during a March interview with the paper.

As many as 5,000 of the $1.50 tests will be made available during the first 12 months, according to the paper.

He purposely chose not to include birth control because he feels that would target a different crowd. 

‘Birth control is for people who don’t necessarily want to act responsibly,’ he continued. ‘I’m not going to tell them what to do. Or help them do it. That’s their business.’

Kelly argued during the wide-ranging interview that birth control is ‘social engineering that we don’t want to get into’ but expressed hope that most people will ‘make the right decision’ if properly informed.

David Driscoll, director for the University of Alaska Anchorage Institute of Circumpolar Health Studies, told the Daily News that condom dispensing machines will also be placed in bar bathrooms.

The condoms will not be paid for with state money.

Alaska is not the first state to offer such a program, bar bathroom tests are also available in Minnesota, and an advocate there said it works, but only among non-problem drinkers.

‘This is not a strategy for the chronic alcoholic who is drinking regardless of whatever message they see,’ Jody Allen Crowe, executive director of Healthy Brains for Children, told the Daily News.

‘This is really focused on the 50 percent of unexpected pregnancies, to find out they are pregnant as early as possible.’

The university will conduct a study concurrent with the pilot to see if it has an impact on the rate of FASD in the country’s northern-most state.

Posters advertising the effort will be put up around three cities and other larger towns offering $15 iTunes gift cards to women who take a telephone survey.
