The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) concluded in March that they should be made public – and this recommendation has now been formally accepted.

The NSABB took a stand over the papers last year out of concerns that details of the studies - which induced mutations in the virus that made it transmissible among mammals by air rather than by close physical contact - could be used for bioterrorism.

Green light: Papers on the H5N1 avian flu virus will be published in Nature and Science this year

However, in a statement
issued on Friday, the director of the National Institutes of Health, 
Francis Collins, said: ‘This information has clear value to national and
international public health preparedness efforts and must be shared 
with those who are poised to realize the benefits of this research.’

When the NSABB initially recommended 
the two papers should not be published in full by the journals where 
they were under consideration, Nature and Science, critics raised fears 
that important science was being censored.

The ensuing debate raised questions 
about whether the research should have been done at all, as well as 
whether current national and international rules on biosafety and 
biosecurity are sufficient to protect the public from dangerous 
microbes.

The biosecurity panel spent two days earlier this year considering the papers.

Deadly: The natural form of H5N1 has infected tens of millions of birds

Both papers describe how scientists 
altered several genes of natural, or wild-type, H5N1 in a way that 
allowed it to spread from the airways of infected ferrets to other 
ferrets caged nearby.

So far, the natural form of H5N1 has 
infected tens of millions of ducks, geese, chickens, and other birds. 
But the only people to be infected - 598, of whom 353 have died - were 
those who came into close contact with the flocks.

The board was persuaded by an 
additional benefit of publishing the research - by informing countries 
where H5N1 is endemic, it would allow scientists there to be on the 
lookout for the mutations that make the virus more transmissible.

‘We had new information, confidential
information, about benefits of this research, and we also had 
confidential information about the risks involved,’ said Paul Keim of 
Northern Arizona University, who is the acting chairman of the panel.

‘And the balance began to change.’

Ron Fouchier, who led one of the experiments, said the NSABB decision was ‘very much to our pleasure.’

Collins added: ‘The U.S. Government 
aims to preserve the benefits of vitally important life sciences 
research that holds the promise of enhancing quality of life for all of 
us, while minimizing the possibility that the knowledge, information, 
products, or technologies provided by such research could be misused for
harm.’
