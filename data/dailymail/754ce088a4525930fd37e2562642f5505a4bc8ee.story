Josie Cunningham is proud of the 36DD taxpayer-funded implants and now hopes to make a career out of showing them off

An aspiring glamour model had her breasts enlarged to size 36DD on the NHS, it emerged yesterday.

The surgery to 22-year-old Josie Cunningham, cost taxpayers £4,800.

She convinced doctors to operate by claiming her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’ and causing emotional distress.

But last night critics were appalled at the decision, branding it a waste of taxpayers’ cash. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect a person’s health’.

Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, says her new breasts have given her the ‘confidence’ she needs to pursue her dream of topless modelling.

She hopes to emulate former Page 3 girl Katie Price.

The unmarried mother, from Leeds, plans to leave her children Harley, five, and Frankie, two, with her parents while she chases her dream.

She told The Sun: ‘My new boobs have changed my life. Now I can’t wait to do topless and swimsuit photoshoots and become the new Katie Price.’

Her operation, at St James’s Hospital in Leeds, was recommended by her GP before being approved by her local Primary Care Trust.

But health bosses were unable to say yesterday why such an enormous cleavage was necessary for Miss Cunningham’s wellbeing.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an outrageous waste of NHS money 
and taxpayers will be appalled that they are having to foot the bill.

‘People expect scarce NHS resources 
to be used to help people with serious medical needs, not to subsidise 
anyone who fancies a career as a glamour model.’

It is understood Miss Cunningham, 
previously a 32A, went to her GP with a ‘congenital medical condition’ 
which left her with no breast tissue.

She said she ‘lived in terror’ of being seen in a bikini and did not feel comfortable venturing out without a padded bra.

It is understood Miss Cunningham, previously a 32A, went to her GP with a ¿congenital medical condition¿ which left her with no breast tissue.

‘I was never depressed about my flat 
chest,’ Miss Cunningham admitted. ‘I just got emotional when I was 
explaining to my GP that I felt I couldn’t live a full life the way I 
was – and he agreed to refer me.

‘They gave me a top surgeon. He said 
he’d have to give me 36DD implants just to achieve the appearance of a 
36C, because there was literally nothing there in the first place.’

The NHS usually pays for cosmetic 
surgery only when it is considered necessary for health reasons. For 
instance it will fund breast reduction if the weight of a woman’s 
breasts are causing her back problems.

However, the criteria for breast enhancement are decided by each local health trust, with no national guidelines available.

In Leeds, it can be granted if the woman suffers from developmental failure, or if she has had a mastectomy or lumpectomy.

It can also be granted for women with
 asymmetric breasts. However, it is unclear whether there is a limit on 
how big the implants should be.

NHS Airedale, Bradford and Leeds said
 it could not comment on individual cases but added: ‘We would like to 
clarify that cosmetic surgery is not routinely funded by the NHS.’

The decision in Miss Cunningham’s case would have been made by a panel including clinicians, it said.

The Department of Health said: ‘It is
 up to the local NHS to decide what treatments to provide but any NHS 
treatment needs to be clinically justified.’

Cosmetic surgery is provided by the NHS only if there is a clinical need

Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need.

This decision is taken at a local level, by the Primary Care Trust (PCT), on the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors.

PCTs set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community.

For cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the PCT must decide there is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded on the NHS.  Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason enough.

Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website.  They include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face lift).

It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria.

The criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity.

Rare cases, however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its individual merits.
