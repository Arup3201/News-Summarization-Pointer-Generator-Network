The devastated mother of a British backpacker killed in a car crash said she does not want to see her daughter's body as she does not want that to be her last memory.

Jade Fox, 22, was travelling through Fraser Island in Queensland when it is believed she fatally hit her head when the 4x4 vehicle she was in overturned at around 2pm on Friday.

She was travelling with seven other friends who all survived the crash with minor injuries.

Ms Fox, from Maidstone in Kent posted an update on Facebook on the morning of her death. She said: 'Up early doors to travel Frazer Island for three days.'

Her father Chris has travelled to Australia to arrange the repatriation of her body. 

Speaking to the BBC, her mother Melanie, 46, said before heading to Australia, she asked her daughter to be careful: 'I always told her if anything happened to her I couldn't cope or with any of them and I said you need to look after yourself, but I couldn't stop her living her dream.

'Her dad says he wants to hold her and see her, I don't think he believes it, but I don't want to see her broken, I just want to remember her how she was.

'I've rarely seen her without a smile so I don't want that to be my last memory of her not smiling.'

Ms Fox's younger sister Amy, 19, said: 'One person that was there for me was Jade, I'm just never going to be able to get over this.

'She just meant everything to me, she was like my rock and she's gone.'

Ms Fox had been working in Sydney for six months and was constantly documenting her trip on Facebook, posting pictures and excited posts about where she was heading to next.

Her vehicle was driving alongside three cars towards Hook Point on the inland route when it crashed.

Police are continuing their investigations into the incident and have said that the vehicle was in the process of taking over another car when it rolled.

Hours before the incident, the British backpacker took to Facebook to express her excitement about the trip

She marked her three months in Australia in July, and believed to have spent most of her time living in Woolloomooloo, east of Sydney.
