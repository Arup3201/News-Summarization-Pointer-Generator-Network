The early morning shooting that sent panic through New Orleans' Bourbon Street was committed by 'two cowardly men' who got into a fight, police officials said.

Nine people were injured in the shootout that happened at 2:45am on the 700 block of the popular tourist street.

The unidentified victims were taken to a hospital, where seven were listed in stable condition and a female was listed in critical condition, police spokesman Frank Robertson said in a statement.

Neither of the suspects have been caught.

Police superintendent Ronal Serpas held a press conference this afternoon and said he is confident the two men will be arrested.

He
 said the two young men were armed with firearms and 'chose to settle 
their dispute with no regard to others. We know more about them than 
they think.'

One witness told WWL-TV that the shooter appeared to target one person, and then opened fire into a crowd.

'Just turned around and he started 
shooting at the crowd. He seemed pissed off at some dude, pulled the gun
 out and started shooting at the guy then turned around on the crowd and
 started shooting at us.'

The incident happened in the heart of the French Quarter tourist district, just steps away from famed jazz venue Preservation Hall, bar Pat O'Brien's and Cafe Du Monde.

An investigation is ongoing. Robertson said no arrests have been made, and no suspects have been identified. Robertson said other details will be released when they become available.

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu on Sunday pledged a swift law-enforcement response.

'Our No. 1 priority is to keep New Orleans safe,' Landrieu said in a statement issued through City Hall spokesman Tyler Gamble. 'These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered ... I am confident that between video evidence and eyewitness accounts, we will bring the perpetrators to justice.'

Sunday morning's incident is the third major shooting on Bourbon Street in the last three years.

Last February on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, four people were treated at a hospital after a shooting. During Halloween in 2011, one person was killed and seven others were injured after gunmen opened fire on each other.
