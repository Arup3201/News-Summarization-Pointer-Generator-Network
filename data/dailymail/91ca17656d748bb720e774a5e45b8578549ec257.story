Emmanuel Adebayor has sent a message to his doubters by posting a wacky picture of himself accompanied with a statement suggesting he is not worried what people think about him.

The eccentric character lived up to his personality by posing in a pair of sunglasses with skulls on each of the lenses.

Adebayor wrote on Instagram: 'The important thing isn't what other people think you are. It's who you are. #Godfirst #aftertraining #GodisGood #faith #workhard #team228 #whynot #RR #lifesgood.'

Emmanuel Adebayor has hit out at his doubters by stating he is not worried what other people think 

Adebayor's last appearance came in the FA Cup fourth round against Leicester City 

The Togo international has not played for Tottenham since January 24 when he came off the substitutes' bench to make a late appearance in his side's FA Cup defeat against Leicester.

Adebayor will be hoping to feature against Manchester United on Sunday afternoon as Tottenham look to close the gap on their upcoming opponents.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, who gave his players a two-day break in the lead up to this weekend's showdown, has a fully fit squad available for their visit to Old Trafford.

The 31-year-old will be hoping to face Manchester United on Sunday afternoon
