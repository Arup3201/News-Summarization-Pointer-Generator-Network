Novak Djokovic sealed a semi-final spot and clinched the year-end world No 1 ranking as the Serb defeated Tomas Berdych at the ATP World Tour Finals on Friday.

Djokovic took just 68 minutes to beat Berdych 6-2, 6-2 and finish top of Group A to book a semi-final against Kei Nishikori, which will be played on Saturday afternoon.

The 27-year-old also will now finish the year at the top of the world rankings for the third time in four years.

Novak Djokovic has won the group.

1. If Stan Wawrinka beats Marin Cilic, then Wawrinka qualifies in second position.

2. If Marin Cilic beats Stan Wawrinka but loses three or more games, then Wawrinka qualifies in second place.

3. If Marin Cilic beats Stan Wawrinka and loses only one or two games, then Cilic qualifies in second place. 

Djokovic said: 'It's a great deal of happiness knowing that what I've been through the entire season in order to get to where I am and finish the year as No. 1. It's one of the ultimate challenges in this sport.'

World No 7 Berdych made a nervy start and was instantly broken before receiving a loud cheer as he finally claimed the seventh point of the match.

But Djokovic was ruthless and went 3-0 up with a double break in nine minutes before wrapping up the set to guarantee progression to the last four.

Berdych had three game points at 40-0 in the opening game of the second set but the Czech repeatedly misfired with his groundstrokes to gift Djokovic the break.

Djokovic then won five of the next seven games as he cruised to his 30th consecutive win indoors and then celebrated securing the year-end No 1 ranking with coach Boris Becker and the rest of his camp.

Stan Wawrinka will seal second spot in Group A and a semi-final against compatriot Roger Federer if he can win at least three games against US Open champion Marin Cilic on Friday night.
