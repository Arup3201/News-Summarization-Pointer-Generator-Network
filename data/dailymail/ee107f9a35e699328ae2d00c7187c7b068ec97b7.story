The verdict is in from a test of nationwide wireless carrier networks aimed at determining which is the over all best. The winner: Verizon.

The carrier took top marks in RootMetrics' Midyear Mobile Network Performance Report in the categories of reliability, speed and data performance.

Just behind Verizon in the report, which used 5.6 million samples to choose its champion, was AT&T. 

Champ: Verizon took top honors in a semi-annual survey conducted by RootMetrics that takes millions of network samples to determine the best wireless carrier in multiple categories and overall

Verizon was ranked the best in nearly all categories -- reliability, speed, data performance, call performance and text performance

RootMetrics tests wireless performance semi-annually and results are in for the first half of 2014. The rankings are as follows:

1. VERIZON

2. AT&T

3.  T-MOBILE

4. SPRINT 

'Verizon has done well with the quick deployment of their AWS network,' RootMetrics President Bill Moore told Bloomberg, referring to the carrier's infrastructure. 

This year's rankings are actually a return to the top spot for Verizon, which up until the most recent study had played second fiddle to AT&T in two studies.

'A year ago AT&T was speeding up, while Verizon was slowing down. There's always an ebb and flow as new networks eventually carry more load.' 

While T-Mobile took third place in the study, RootMetrics notes that the carrier has improved at city level with a focus on urban centers. 

CNET notes that T-Mobile, which has been aggressively building a 4G LTE network in urban areas, has vastly improved sine the second rankings of 2013.

T-Mobile took top marks in 32 urban markets out of 125.

Behind the pack, in fourth place, came Sprint. The underperforming carrier, which is in the middle of a corportate shakeup, took lowest marks nearly across the board in the study's categories.

The categories for which the carriers were rates were reliability, speed, data performance, call performance and text performance.

Second place: AT&T was also ranked highly in the survey with T-Mobile and Sprint trailing well behind
