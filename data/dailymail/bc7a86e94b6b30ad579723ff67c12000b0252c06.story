For travellers worried about getting stuck in traffic en route to the airport, this could be the perfect solution.

A Slovenian designer has come up with the perfect accessory for travellers who ride mini-scooters – one that turns into a suitcase or a backpack.

Weighing 9lbs, The Olaf Business, which can carry up to 220lbs, is a carry-on airline-approved suitcase that can also be used as a trolley and a kick-scooter. 

The OLAF is a world first as it doubles as both a kick scooter and carry-on sized airline wheeled luggage

The three-in-one hybrid was developed by 36-year-old Bostjan Zagar who wanted to create a sturdy solution for his travelling needs.

The Olaf Business, which will be priced at £200, is a carry-on case on wheels, with extractable handle, rear break and a smart folding mechanism.

And the Olaf Urban, to be sold for around £175, aimed at city commuters, has phone and headphone space, wheel pockets and a soft wooden longboard, similar to a skateboard.

Both models are ergonomically shaped and safe to use on the street due to their rear wheel brakes and reflective material.

Mr Zagar's designs proved to be so popular that he recently exceeded his $30,000 Kickstarter goal

Mr Zagar - who developed the Olaf with his father - spent three years perfecting the accessory

The resulting designs proved to be so popular that they recently exceeded their $30,000 Kickstarter goal by more than $5,000. 

Using his expertise as a machine engineer and his father's knowledge in tool making, Mr Zagar began combining suitcases with scooters with his dad in their home garage in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

The father-son team began mixing longboard designs with kick scooters and then worked the idea of adding luggage to it for the city commuter.

'We thought our two products were very good and all the test drives were great,' Mr Zagar said. 

'We then headed to the ISPO fair, where the Olaf was a big hit.

'The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and encouraging,' he continued. 'This gave us the motivation and the confidence to further our product development.' 

ISPO is an international sporting goods trade fair where designers from all over the world showcase their inventions.
