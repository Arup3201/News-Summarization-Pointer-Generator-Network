Megan Buttell can never forget the constant humiliation she felt for the way she looked.

Growing up as an obese child with red hair, she was faced with perpetual vile abuse from her peers.

The 23-year-old, of Perth in Western Australia, vividly recalls being labelled a 'whale' and a 'fat ranga'. She was once told by a man: 'you're so fat you should kill yourself'.

Her way of dealing with the criticism was by living on a diet of chocolate - her only source of comfort.

But when she reached her heaviest at 104kg, Ms Buttell decided it was finally time to make a change.

Now she feels like a whole new person, having dropped 10 dress sizes after losing 40kg.

Megan Buttell, of Perth, used to live on a diet of chocolate and never exercised. Although she was unhappy with her body, her only source of comfort was food

'I've been overweight all my life and always been bullied,' Ms Buttell told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was a fat kid with red hair and always felt uncomfortable in my own skin.'

Her unhealthy lifestyle consisted of chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

'I'd start off the day having a caramel slice then snack on some M&M's then have a block of chocolate and drink chocolate milk instead of water,' she said.

'I was so obsessed with chocolate, it's embarrassing.'

Ms Buttell has gone from a size 20 (as shown in black pants she is holding) to a size 10

The 23-year-old has lost 40kg - nearly half her original body weight - since she began exercising early last year

Exercise was not an option as she was worried it would prompt others to tease her more.

'I never played sport in my life and I didn't even want to try,' Ms Buttell said.

'I also was very lazy that I rolled around on my chair at work to get around the office - instead of walking around.

'But I was so sad about the way I looked and couldn't even go into clothing stores because I was too big for anything in the shop. It was hard to look at myself.

Ms Buttell says she used to find it difficult to look at herself in the mirror

'I didn't even want to eat in public because I was afraid people were judging me.'

Her insecurities were heightened by others who mistreated her.

'People used to call me a whale and shout out "fat ranga" as they drove past,' she said.

'Some even asked me if they could stand next to me so they could look skinnier.

'But what was really horrible was when a guy once told me: "you're so fat you should kill yourself".'  

This was the way of life for Ms Buttell - who's 169cm tall - until early last year.

'I jumped on the scales and couldn't believe that I was weighing over 100kg,' she said.

'It's at that point I decided that I need to sort myself out and lose weight.'

She eliminated junk from her diet in exchange for chicken and vegetables, exercising for two hours six times a week. 

That was about 19 months ago, when she signed up for Goodlife Health Club's 12 Week Challenge.

Since joining, Ms Buttell has done the challenge four times and has gone from 104kg to 64kg.

She was also recently crowned the state winner of the challenge.

'Now I feel like food doesn't control me,' she said.

'I never thought I could be healthy, active and feel so happy about the way I look.

'There's this confidence that I've really felt before.

'If anyone is thinking about losing weight – just do it. You don't know how amazing and life changing it is until you do it and there's really no better feeling in the world.'
