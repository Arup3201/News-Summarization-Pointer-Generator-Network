A fortune teller who tries to predict the future using asparagus today unveiled her top tips for 2013 - including another Royal wedding and yet more wet weather.

Mystic Jemima Packington, 57, is the world's only Asparamancer and claims to see the future by tossing the spears into the air and interpreting how they land.

She has made dozens of accurate predictions in recent years, including the demise of Gordon Brown, the credit crunch, and Kate Middleton's pregnancy - but there have been a few duds along the way too.

Future tips: Mystic Jemima Packington predicts the future using asparagus

Asparamancer: Jemima Packington, tosses the spears into the air and makes her predictions based on how they fall - like ancient rune castors

For example, last year she said an animal will win an Oscar, which is impossible because animals are ineligible, and the asparagus crop will fare better - which it didn't.

Today, she made her predictions for 2013 which include Greece leaving the euro and another tsunami for the Far East.

Jemima, who is originally from Pershore, Worcestershire, but now lives in Bath, Somerset, said: 'It might sound silly to some people but my readings are very accurate.

'I have been doing readings using asparagus since I was eight years old.

'My great aunt read tea leaves and I have inherited her gift.'

Jemima only uses fresh Worcestershire asparagus grown in the Vale of Evesham - the UK's main supplier of the vegetable.

Jemima Packington has made dozens of accurate predictions in recent years, including the demise of Gordon Brown, the credit crunch, and Kate Middleton's pregnancy

Last year she correctly predicted the 
Royal pregnancy for Kate and William, Olympic success for Britain and a 
dismal performance for the England football team at Euro 2012

She picks a handful of tips, tosses them into the air and 'reads' the shapes they form when they land.

One
of Jemima's most remarkable predictions was that Gordon Brown would not
only be ousted but also leave politics completely after his election 
defeat in 2010.

She said: 'I was asked to do a reading about Gordon Brown just before the general election.

'I cast the spears and they were all pointing down and several spear tips had lost their spores which indicates tears.

Jemima correctly predicted last year that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would get pregnant

'My reading of this was that he would lose the election in 2010 and would then leave politics altogether.

'I was the first person to predict this and people said I was mad at the time but it came true.

'I have a very good success rate, but because it's an interpretation you can sometimes be slightly off the mark.'

Last year she correctly predicted the 
Royal pregnancy for Kate and William, Olympic success for Britain and a 
dismal performance for the England football team at Euro 2012.

Jemima said: 'When they first announced the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy there was talk of it being twins.

'This has not been confirmed yet, though which is what I originally saw in the spears.

'We will have massive extremes in weather but on a plus side we will have a better crop of asparagus in 2013.

'Sometimes what comes to you can seem incredibly off the wall. Yet sometimes you are certain. It is a bit grim for 2013.

'I can't remember how many were correct last year but it was around six out of the 10. When a spear breaks it is the equivalent of the death card in Tarot readings.

'It is not necessarily a bad thing because it indicates a parting of ways.'
