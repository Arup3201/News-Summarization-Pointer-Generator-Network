Louis van Gaal will arrive in Manchester next week as a winner after 
heaping more misery on Brazil’s wretched World Cup campaign.

Van Gaal
 is set to be unveiled at Old Trafford on Thursday with his reputation 
enhanced from a rewarding month in South America that saw Holland 
qualify from the Group of Death and last night complete an impressive 
third-place finish.

For Brazil, while they weren’t thrashed quite as 
badly as they had been against Germany in Tuesday night’s historic 
semi-final, a second successive heavy defeat on home soil was a 
devastating end to a campaign which promised so much.

Manager Felipe Scolari, a World Cup winner in 2002, surely won’t be able to survive this.

He’s been accused by 200 million people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics. On last night’s evidence in Brasilia, they aren’t all be wrong.

Holland carried on where Germany left off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of blunders from Brazilian centre-backs Thiago Silva and David Luiz.

The South Americans huffed and puffed after that without ever suggesting
 they had the quality to launch a fightback and Georgino Wijnaldum 
completed the humiliation in injury-time.

Scolari made six changes 
from the team humiliated by Germany for a third-place play-off which for
 once carried some meaning.

Van Gaal stuck with his big guns Arjen 
Robben and Robin van Persie though Wesley Sneijder didn’t last beyond 
the warm-up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by 
Jonathan de Guzman of Swansea City.

Any hope among supporters in 
Brazil’s capital city that their team could restore national pride after
 the infamous 7-1 beating by Germany lasted less than three minutes.

Silva,
 who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension, wasn’t strong 
enough to stop van Persie from turning midway in the Brazilian half and 
releasing Robben.

As the Bayern forward sped towards the penalty 
area, Silva gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt. The 
connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but Robben 
fell inside, and referee Djamel Halmoudi awarded a penalty that van 
Persie converted high and hard.

The only consolation for Brazil was 
that Silva escaped with just a yellow card when he’d clearly denied 
Robben a goalscoring opportunity.

By 17 minutes, Brazil had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing.

Luiz
 was again the fall-guy, heading a clearance straight to Daley Blind who
 had time to take two touches to control the ball with his left foot and
 then dispatch a finish with his right into the roof of the net past 
Julio Cesar.

All together now: Daley Blind (second left) celebrates scoring Holland's second goal against Brazil

Brazil looked shellshocked but while Germany were hungry
 for more goals on Tuesday night, the Dutch were happy to sit back until
 they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the counter-attack.

Oscar
 started to see more of the ball and was unlucky that his whipped-in 
free-kick didn’t get a decisive touch off Chelsea team-mate Willian or 
Jo.

One solo run and shot by Oscar was saved by Jasper Cillessen – Brazil’s only effort on target in the entire first half.

Even
 in low gear, Holland seemed more likely to score. Van Persie had a low 
shot saved by Julio Cesar and when the Dutch broke, they met little 
resistance from a woeful Brazilian midfield.

Scolari, whose job looks
 certain end sooner rather than later, made a change at the interval 
with Manchester City’s Fernandinho replacing Luis Gustavo.

Gustavo’s 
only contribution of the opening 45 minutes had been to leave Dirk Kuyt 
with a nasty gash on the back of his head with a wayward arm.

But it 
didn’t improve much for Brazil after half-time. The harder poor Luiz 
tried, the worse it got for him as he gave the ball away with 
regularity.

The scorer of an incredible free-kick against Colombia 
couldn’t beat Cillessen with a relatively tame effort when given a 
shooting chance from 25 yards.

Jose Mourinho must be thinking he’s a genius for selling the shaggy-haired defender for £40million before the World Cup.

Clincher: Holland midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum seals victory with injury-time strike

His
 former Chelsea team-mate Oscar didn’t fare much better. He was booked 
for diving when he ran into Blind and then somersaulted in the air 
looking for a penalty.  Poor Blind had to be carried off with a hurt 
knee as a result of the coming-together and Daryl Janmaat replaced him 
for the last 20 minutes.

By the time Scolari introduced Hulk for the latter stages, you knew he and the entire nation were desperate.

It
 was no surprise when the muscular forward got himself into a good 
shooting position and then took a wild swipe at the ball to send it 
wide.

Down and out: Georginio Wijnaldum scored the 10th goal against Brazil in two games - a new low

Van Gaal was angry that Robben – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down.

But
 ultimately, it didn’t matter. In fact, Janmaat crossed for Wijaldum to 
make it 3-0 and van Gaal was able to send on third-choice goalkeeper 
Michel Vorm to ensure all 23 of his players in Brazil had tasted some 
action - a nice touch.

The contrast between the relaxed way Holland’s
 players found space and knocked the ball around compared to the 
hypertension in Brazil’s game was evident.

If van Gaal can replicate it at Old Trafford, the fallen champions will be more than happy.
