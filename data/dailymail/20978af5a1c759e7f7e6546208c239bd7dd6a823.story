'Failure to comply': Adrian Marmont appeared at court charged with failing to carry out essential improvement works at a property in the city

A building contractor who worked alongside flamboyant interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen on the TV show HomeFront has appeared in court charged with failing to carry out essential improvements to a property.

Adrian Marmont - who emphasises his links to the BBC programme on his company website - is accused of failing to take action to address damp and mould growing at a property in Brighton.

The contractor, of Worthing, West Sussex, denied the charge of failing to comply with an improvement notice during a short hearing at Brighton Magistrates Court today (Thursday).

Marmont is described on his website as having worked 'alongside various architects and designers...most recognisable being Laurence Llewelyn Bowen and Diarmuid Gavin'.

Garden designer and TV personality Gavin fronted the home makeover show along with Llewelyn-Bowen.

The charge is in relation to a house in 
Queen's Park Road, Brighton, on which work was supposed to have been 
completed by February 9 of this year.

Len Batten, prosecuting on behalf of Brighton and Hove City Council, said: 'The order was served on Mr Marmont, being the owner, and required work to be carried out on the premises on damp and mould which was growing as well as on fire precautions.

‘It had to be commenced by January 9 this year and completed by February 9.

‘The works were not carried out on the dates and we believe are still not carried out.’

The court was told Marmont's defence would be that of reasonable excuse relating to a previous lands valuation tribunal on the issue.

A description of Adrian Marmont Construction on the firm's website states: 'Our success has been built on our reputation which led us to work with Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Diarmuid Gavin as the builder and project managers on the BBC HomeFront programmes.'

HomeFront ran on the BBC from 1996 to 2000. The hearing was adjourned for a two day trial on November 19.
