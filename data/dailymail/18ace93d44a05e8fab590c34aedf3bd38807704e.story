A graffiti artist painted a memorial to Leon Bartholomew who died from a rare form of cancer

A graffiti artist has paid tribute to a two-year-old boy who died from a rare form of cancer by spray painting the toddler's face onto a 30ft memorial wall.

Scott Vincent spent two days painting the skate park mural in honour of little Leon Bartholomew, who lost a six month battle against the disease.

It shows the cartoon-mad youngster with Mickey Mouse ears and has been described as a 'shrine' by his grieving father Daniel, 25.

Family and friends have flocked to the wall in his hometown of New Milton, Hampshire, to lay flowers, light candles and add messages.

Leon was diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, which caused tumours to form his lungs and brain.

Mr Bartholomew was touched when Mr Vincent travelled from his home in Brighton, East Sussex, to commemorate Leon's life.

He described the finished work as a 'perfect picture' of his son.

The former warehouse worker, who had to quit his job when Leon fell ill, said: 'The whole family was warmed when we saw the wall for the first time.

'We were all devastated when Leon passed away after battling a rare form of cancer for six months.

'But the wall is the a great way to remember our son and people have treated it with respect - it's just like a shrine.'

The wall is on the grounds of the skate park in New Milton where neighbours have been paying their respects.

Mr Bartholomew added: 'The response from the public has been amazing.

'Even people that didn't know Leon or the family have been down to the wall to lay flowers and light candles.

'Everyone loves it and the graffiti wall is the talk of the town.

'People have been writing special messages, it's great because it's as if it's Leon's wall.'

The family heard of Mr Vincent from a friend who contacted him about doing something special for Leon.

Mr Bartholomew added: 'We gave the artist a photo of Leon and he has managed to recreate the perfect picture of our son.

Five tumours were found in Leon's brain when he was rushed to hospital after a suffering a seizure

'It only took Scott two days to spray and I couldn't believe how accurate it was, as he just used a photo we gave him.

'He wanted to create something light-hearted and fun and decided to spray it as a cartoon. I think it's perfect.

'Leon loved cartoons. We love the wall and think it's perfect. I can't thank Scott enough.

'People still go down to the skate park every day to pay their respects.'.

A Facebook page was set up so Leon's family could receive messages of support from well-wishers and update people on his progress after he was diagnosed in October 2012.

In February, Leon was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure, where he was stabilised and recovered well.

But a CT scan revealed five tumours in his brain and he passed away on March 22.

His family informed followers of his death by writing: 'Leon Bartholomew fell asleep and grew his angel wings this morning surrounded by love and kindness.

'No matter what was thrown at him, no matter what he had to go through, he always came back fighting, with a giggle and a cheeky grin.

'Not many people could go through the things he did and not complain a single time.

'He had so much fight in him, and so much strength, he truly was an inspiration to us all.

'We love him with our entire hearts, minds and souls.'

Leon's mother, Rowena Hyett, 25, set up a Just Giving website that has already raised more than Â£1,000 for children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent.
