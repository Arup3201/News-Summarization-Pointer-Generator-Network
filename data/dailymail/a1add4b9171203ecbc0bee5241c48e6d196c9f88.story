Actor Paul Rudd has denied being one of the passengers who helped take down a homophobic man who kicked a man at a Texas airport.

Video released of the altercation at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport last Thursday showed a man who looked like the 45-year-old Hollywood star - sparking internet rumors.

The Anchorman and Clueless star had been watching the Kansas City Royals win baseball's American League Conference final the night before the brawl, leading some to think he could have stopped off to catch a connecting flight.

But his publicist said it was not him, and one of the men who helped restrain the suspect is simply a lookalike.

'Show it up your a** man,' the attacker, who appeared intoxicated, yelled.

The angered man then kicks the victim in the pink skirt and also hits him in the head, reports WTSP.

Another passenger vehemently asks why the man attacked the man in the pink shirt completely unprovoked.

'We saw a very troubled man, ‘said Kennedy's brother Andrew.

'We hope that he was under the influence of some kind of substance, because if he wasn't and that's his true personality, then he's going to have a long road in front of him.'

Police have not openly identified the suspect in this case though an arrest was made on Thursday.

As the man is being put into handcuffs he can be seen smiling into the camera.
