Holidaymakers in search of the perfect break should start with a four and a half hour flight, stay for no more than 11 days and book into a hotel that has a quick ten-mile airport transfer.

Hotel pools, unlimited free films and an all-night bar were also some of the top things Brits want when their vacation, a study revealed.

Researchers polled 2,000 people to find out what made the ideal annual holiday and it emerged that a partner is the ideal travel companion, room service should be ordered four times during the stay and an in-room spa service is high on the list of desires.

Off-site activities, good weather and stunning scenery are all important luxury holiday factors 

Once arriving at the resort at the start of the perfect holiday, women would prefer to enjoy a cup of tea while men will be ready for a chilled beer.

And on the first evening away, a restaurant serving the best local cuisine will mean the holiday has got off to the perfect start.

Brits on holiday would like to stay in a hotel that is no more than a seven minute walk away from a beach; they would really enjoy time by the pool in either a black bikini or blue swimming shorts.

The Game of Thrones books and celebrity biographies would be on hand to read alongside the daily papers as well as a crossword. 

Perfect summertime tunes to listen to by the pool include Adele's Someone Like You and Will Smith's Summertime

When not resting by the pool, the perfect holiday would include four excursions away from the hotel.

Favourite songs to listen to by the pool include warbler Adele's Someone Like You, Barbadian beauty Rihanna's We Found Love and Will Smith's Summertime. 

Aqua aerobics, yoga, salsa dancing and language classes are also activities that should be available to those enjoying their dream trip away.

Time with the family, good weather and scenery were also listed as important factors for the luxurious holiday.

Avoiding leaving too much of Britain behind, Brits also want to be able to enjoy a roast dinner on their flight.

Extra leg-room, in-flight entertainment and non-reclining seats were all said to be really important when choosing the perfect holiday.

It also emerged the dream holiday will set the average adult back £602. 

The study was conducted by Monarch Airlines.
