Unrepentant: Imelda Marcos, widow of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, holds two-day-old Zian Jay Rosay during her campaign for re-election

Imelda Marcos, the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos known for her extravagant lifestyle and thousands of shoes, has been pressing the flesh with the people of the Philippines as she attempts to keep her seat on the country's congress.

The 83-year-old was pictured holding a baby and shaking hands with her electorate at the Mothering Center, one of her health projects, in the Ilocos Norte province, in the northern Philippines yesterday.

Marcos is running for re-election in the May 13 mid-term elections as congresswoman in Ilocos Norte, the home province of her late husband, where she was first elected in 2010.

During her husband's reign, known for corruption, political repression and human rights violations, Imelda's extravagant lifestyle reportedly included £3million shopping trips in New York, Rome and Copenhagen and she once sent a plane to pick up Australian white sand for a new beach resort.

She was especially notorious for her shoe collection, which was estimated to be around 2,700 pairs.

While many of her countrymen languished in poverty, she purchased a portfolio of desirable properties in Manhattan in the 1980s, which was later seized and sold, along with many of her jewels and most of her extensive art collection.

Marcos also orchestrated lavish public events using millions of dollars in public funds to laud her husband's regime and her own public image.

The Marcoses fled the Philippines at the climax of the army-backed 'people power' revolt in 1986 and left behind staggering amounts of personal belongings, clothes and art objects at their palace, including at least 1,220 pairs of the former first lady's shoes.

Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 and his widow and children returned home in 1991.

She continues to fight the government over her abandoned assets more than two decades after her husband’s reign ended.

The Marcoses, their relatives and business cronies were accused of looting up to £6billion from state coffers and faced up to 900 cases of corruption and other charges.

When she announced her shock decision to run for election in 2010, she was pictured kissing the glass coffin of her embalmed husband and said: 'He was our best ever president.

'During his time we had territorial integrity, freedom, justice and human rights. Whatever else people may say those were the best times ever for the Philippines.'

About a third of Manila’s 12 million residents live in slums, and a third of 94 million Filipinos live below the poverty line of $1.25 a day.

Marcos was born in Manila. Her paternal ancestors were wealthy, powerful landowners. She married Ferdinand Marcos in 1953 and was instrumental in his rise to power.

In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos became the 10th President of the Philippines In 1972 he declared martial law to preserve his hold on power. Together with Imelda, he would rule the Philippines until his removal in February 1986.

His wife was appointed to numerous powerful positions in the government. In December of 1972, Carlito Dimahilig tried to stab her to death with a bolo knife during an award ceremony broadcast live on television. He was gunned down by police. The wounds on Marcos' hands and arms required 75 stitches.

On February 25, 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii after his regime was toppled by the four-day revolution. The uprising was sparked in part by rumours that the couple were involved in the 1983 assassination of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., Marcos' foremost political opponent.

Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989 of a cardiac arrest.
