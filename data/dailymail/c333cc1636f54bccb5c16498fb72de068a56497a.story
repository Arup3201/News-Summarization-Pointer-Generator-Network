Like any girl of her age, Emma Cahill loves to wear heels. However, shopping for them is pretty tricky.

That's because the 19-year-old, from Worcester, has one of the biggest pairs of feet of any woman in Europe - and at size 14, she has only ever found shoes that fit her at a shop in Germany.

The 6ft 5in Oxford Brookes University student, who is double the UK women’s average size of seven, owns one pair of stilettos but finds it ‘impossible’ to find the right shoes.

She said: ‘I think I’ve got the biggest feet in Europe, which makes it impossible to find shoes that fit. I own one pair of stilettos - but they’re not very classy. I dream of owning a pair of Louboutins.’

Miss Cahill - whose feet are larger than those of 6ft 7in England footballer Peter Crouch, a size 12 - said wearing heels puts her at 7ft, and men are often too intimidated to speak to her when she is out.

She added: ‘Although I love being tall, I’ve only been approached once in a club - and that was by a man who was taller than me.

‘Besides our mutual height, we didn’t have much in common. I’d rather date a man who is taller than me, but I realise that I may be raising the bar too high.’

Problems that Miss Cahill encounters daily include fitting into cars and banging her head on door frames. She is even considering putting pipe insulator on frames in her home to prevent injury.

Meanwhile she faces wardrobe problems. Finding clothes that fit is a constant battle and she is often forced to wear leggings underneath dresses which come up too short on her.

‘The biggest issue is finding shoes that fit me,' she said. 'I love shoes and it’s so hard getting ones I like. There’s only one place I can buy them in Germany. Last time I went I spent £500 on five pairs.’

From the age of nine she wore a bigger-than-average size nine - the same size feet as her mum Jane, 49 - and up to the age of 14 she grew a shoe size every year.

She even beats Crouchy: The feet of Miss Cahill (right in left photo, pictured with her friend Miss Daly) are even bigger than those of 6ft 7in Stoke City and England footballer Peter Crouch (right, pictured on Saturday)

She said: ‘I was so relieved when my feet stopped growing. I was terrified I’d end up with boat feet.’

Miss Cahill - whose 49-year-old father Andrew is also a size 14, and 15-year-old sister 
Jenni is a 10 - added that her feet don’t look that big because they are in 
proportion with her height.

Trousers
 are out of the question for Miss Cahill, so three-quarter length jeans 
with a long top are her preferred outfit. Meanwhile the teenager is 
limited to just one pair of shoes for evenings out.

For the last six years she has sported a gold pair of pumps bought from a US website which has since gone out of business.

Miss Cahill, whose feet measure 13in, has re-heeled the shoes three times, and even has to repaint them with gold fabric paint three times a year.

'I try to keep up with the trends, but when you have to base an outfit around the same pair of shoes, it’s not easy'

She said: ‘I try to keep up with the trends, but when you have to base an outfit around the same pair of shoes, it’s not easy.

‘I don’t know what I’ll do when they finally give in - I guess I’ll have to plan another trip to the shop in Germany. Last time I went, when I was 13-years-old, I was a size 13, but my feet have grown so I’ve stretched the shoes.

‘The shop only stocks up to a size 13, but the shoemaker says he can make footwear especially for me in a size 14. He’s my only hope.’
