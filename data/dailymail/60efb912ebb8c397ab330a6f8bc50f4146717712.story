Israeli drink maker SodaStream International Ltd. will relocate a factory next year that activists criticized for being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a representative said Wednesday.

Nirit Hurwitz said that the decision to move the facility to Lehavim in Israel's southern Negev region is for 'purely commercial' reasons and is not connected to pressure from Palestinian activists who had boycotted the company because of its location.

Activists launched a campaign boycotting the company because of the factory being in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, a territory captured by Israel in 1967 that's claimed by the Palestinians.

Hurwitz said the new location received a $20 million grant from the Israeli government. The new location 'will become our flagship manufacturing site and is expected to deliver operational excellence and result in savings of 2 percent across our entire cost base.' she said.

The Palestinian boycott campaign welcomed the announced move, saying its boycott caused retailers to drop SodaStream.

The Israeli company, which signed on Scarlett Johansson as their first Global Brand Ambassador, runs three factories in the occupied West Bank and many say the company is taking advantage of the Palestinian residents who have few other employment options.

Johansson ended an eight-year role as an Oxfam goodwill ambassador early this year after causing an uproar by appearing in ads for the company. 

SodaStream says it employs hundreds of Palestinians and gives them equal benefits as Israeli workers. Most of them are from nearby West Bank towns.

The company's chief executive Daniel Birnbaum told the Independent in February:  

'We purchase special health insurance for our 500 Palestinian employees so that we can be sure they have coverage for things like emergency surgery and organ transplants,' 

Officials say there were no financial incentives to base the company on the controversial Mishor Adumim and insisted Sodastream has no political agenda. 

For Palestinian workers from Ramallah, the new facility will be 107 kilometers (66 miles) away. For those from Hebron, it will be 48 kilometers (29 miles) away.

'We are offering all employees the opportunity to join us in Lehavim, and specifically, we are working with the Israeli government to secure work permits for our Palestinian employees,' Birnbaum said.

Boycott or no, sales of SodaStream's soda machines have been weak in the United States as consumers in the company's biggest market opt for healthier drinks such as juices and teas over sodas.

'Our third quarter performance was pressured by challenging selling conditions for soda makers and flavors primarily in the U.S.,'  Birnbaum said, adding that performance outside the United States was mixed.

Birnbaum announced a 'comprehensive growth plan' meant to return SodaStream to profitable growth.

As part of that plan, the company said it would be shutting down and relocating operations from two facilities into a new plant. It would also discontinue certain beverage makers and flavors at a cost of about $20 million to the company.

The financial impact of those two moves will be spread out from the fourth quarter into 2015.

'We are fully committed to getting the company back on track,' Birnbaum said.

It was reported in July that SodaStream was in talks with an investment firm to be taken private in a deal valuing the company at $828 million.

SodaStream's shares received a boost last week when it said it would sell some PepsiCo Incbrands such as Pepsi Homemade, that are not sold in stores in a limited test.

SodaStream said third-quarter revenue was $125.9 million, down from $144.6 million a year earlier. net profit was $9.5 million versus $16.4 million a year earlier.

The company lowered its forecast for all of 2014, saying revenue was expected to decrease about 9 percent from $562.7 million in 2013, and profit was expected to drop about 42 percent from $42.0 million in 2013. Previously the company had forecast a 5 percent drop in both revenue and profit from 2013.
