Acer has unveiled a new range of products at a conference in China, including the 'industry's first 8.1-inch tablet' called the Iconia W3.

The Taiwanese company also provided details of a new 5.7-inch smartphone called the Liquid S1, and an upgrade to its Aspire S7 ultrabook.

At the launch, the group's president Jim Wang 
said the company had 'reinvented' itself over the past two 
years, following a decline in sales.

The Iconia W3 (pictured) runs on Microsoft's Windows 8 Professional software, while Acer's new Liquid S1 phablet will run on Google's Android. The Iconia W3 has an 1.8Ghz dual-core Intel Atom processor and a 1280-by-768 resolution, multi-touch LCD display

The 5.7-inch Liquid S1 smartphone has been dubbed a phablet because of its size.

Phablets are devices that are smaller than traditional tablets but larger than traditional phones.

It has a 1280-by-720 HD display and runs on the latest version of Google's operating system, Android Jelly Bean 4.2.

The Liquid S1 has a 1.5GHz processor as well as dual SIM card slots that let owners switch between using it for personal and business reasons.

It has an 8MP rear-facing 1080p camera, with a 2MP camera that can shoot 720p, on the front.

Acer's latest phablet comes with Acer Cloud Docs and Acer Remote Files built-in, which lets users save and then access documents wirelessly on the web, as well as software what the company calls Float.

Float helps users multi-task by letting them run widgets on top of apps.

Acer also claims the Liquid S1 has 'a day's worth of battery power'.

The Liquid S1 is expected to go on sale in the UK towards the end of the year and will cost around £300 for a matte black or white, 8GB model. 

The Iconia W3 tablet runs on the full version of Windows 8 Professional and Wang said it was the 'industry's first 8.1inch' device.

It comes with Microsoft Office Home or Student built-in.

Wang said the device is perfect for both home and work environments because it can be attached to a keyboard.

Acer's Chairman James Wang unveiled a new range of products at the Computex exhibition in Taipei, China on Monday. They included the Liquid S1 smartphone, the S7 ultrabook as well as a new 8-inch Windows tablet called the Iconia W3

He touted the device for 'performing like a desktop' while allowing users to fold up the keyboard
and carry the device in one hand.

The
Iconia W3 is powered by Intel's Atom Z2760 dual-core processor and will
be available in 32GB and 64GB versions when it goes on sale later this 
month.

It has a 1280-by-768 resolution multi-touch LCD display as well as built-in WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0, and weighs 540g.

Members of the press who attended Acer's conference in Taipei also got hands-on time with the widely-praised Aspire R7.

Acer said its Iconia W3 tablet is the first device to have an 8.1-inch tablet. Because it runs a full version of Microsoft Office, including Word, the tablet can be attached to a keyboard to make typing easier. The keyboard does not come with the device and is expected to cost an additional £60 when the device range launches later this month

The
R7 is a laptop-tablet hybrid which has a pad attached to a hinge that 
holds a touchscreen monitor that users can pull closer or flip over the 
keyboard, transforming it into a tablet.

Other
companies showcasing new technologies at the IT conference include Asus
and Microsoft, which claims that 65 Windows-8 based tablets and PCs 
will be exhibited.

number of tablets sold increased by 142 percent to 49 million units over
the same period last year, according to International Data Corp.

The
market is dominated by Apple and vendors selling Google's Android 
devices. Latecomer Microsoft has less than a 4 percent share.

Meanwhile, global desktop and laptop 
shipments slipped 12.7 percent year-on-year to 78 million units in the

Analyst
Vincent Chen of Taipei's Yuanta Securities says that Acer's recent 
innovations may help reverse the company's decline, but that much more 
work remains to be done before it is out of the woods.

Among the other products Acer is showcasing at Computex is a new generation of its widely praised Transformer tablet.

The Transformer series feature a detachable keyboard with a two-sided display panel that can be used for work on one side and film transmission or other entertainment on the other.

Acer's Chairman J.T Wang attends a news conference in which Acer introduced its new tablet Iconia W3 and smartphone Liquid S1 as part of a preview at the Computex exhibition in China. The company said 'it's not about computers anymore; it's about computing. When we look at smartphones, we look at perspective and what new things we can bring in a smartphone.' 'Most smartphone products are very single-tasked, so focusing on that with the S1, we said shall we make a larger smartphone or a tablet'
