A Drexel University college sophomore died of a deadly case of meningitis on Monday.

Stephanie Ross, 19, of Pittsburgh was found unresponsive in her room by her sorority sisters at the they all lived on Monday morning and was transported to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

The girls of the sorority Phi Mu-Beta Tau or all other students who came into contact with Ross were given antibiotics as a preventative measure.

Meningitis is a bacterial infection that causes symptoms such as fever, vomiting, stiff neck, headache, confusion, and sensitivity to light. It is characterized as a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

The New York Daily News reports that Ross was a popular student who majored in mechanical engineering and played for her college's softball team. She was a stand-out student in both high school and college.

'Stephanie was an outstanding young woman who exemplified the values we have for students at Upper St. Clair in terms of academics, extra-curricular activities and community involvement. At USC, Stephanie was a National Merit Scholar, softball player, and volunteer,' said her High School's Superintendent Patrick O'Toole in a statement to WTAE.

Ross was just as loved at her college as she was at her high school. Facebook shows numerous photos of her and her sorority sisters having fun at parties and college events.

Ross was a charitable girl and her last post on facebook announced that she planned to donate eight inches of her hair to a charity that provides wigs to children with cancer.

Stephanie Ross' unfortunate case of meningitis may seem like a freak incident, but meningitis at college campuses is on the rise.

Earlier this year at Princeton University, over seven students were infected with meningitis B, a rare strain of meningitis that's only prevented by one vaccine not offered in the United States.

In order to manage the outbreak, the campus ordered a vaccination called Bexsero that has not yet been approved in the United States.

The Mail Online got the chance to speak to Dr. Daryl Isaacs, an expert in preventative medicine, clinical diagnosis, and travel medicine. He is currently on staff at New York University School of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, and New York Downtown Hospital.

He was also featured as the doctor in the popular documentary, 'SuperSize Me.'

He told the Mail Online , 'All students should get vaccinated before going to college.'

'It's a disease caused by overcrowding,' he said. 'It spreads anywhere there are people such as in dormitories, cafeterias, and prisons.'

He also emphasized the dangers of the disease and called it, 'rapidly spreading and highly fatal.'

He said most college students are required to be vaccinated before arriving on campus and if students opt out of the meningitis vaccination then they must sign a waiver.

Whether or not Ross was up to date on her vaccinations is unknown.
