A bungling beautician manages to burn off a chunk of her hair as she demonstrates how, or rather how not, to use a set of curling tongs.

The hapless instructor, named Tori Locklear, who is believed to be from the United States, begins her tutorial by taking a length of her hair and wrapping it around the electric curler.

'So basically, if you want medium curls, maybe take a piece about this big,' she begins, holding the section of hair between her fingers.

Hair we go: Bungling beautician Toni Locklear begins her tutorial on how to use a set of curling tongs

Roll with it: Toni wraps a length of her hair around the iron and tells viewers to 'count to twenty or more'

After wrapping the hair around the iron she tells her viewers: 'count to twenty, or longer'.

But as she pulls the iron away from her head with the intention of showing of a bouncing curl, she pulls the entire chunk of her hair out with it, leaving just a singed stump.

There is a brief moment between her noticing the hair is still attached to the iron and the grim realisation of what has just happened sinking in.

Oops: Tori shows off the curling tongs with the length of her hair still attached

Some have suggested the video may be a spoof, although the look of sheer horror on her face would be hard to feign.

She then whispers: 'You're kidding me'.

To her credit Tori reappears on the camera to say: 'Well I just burnt my hair off!' and still went ahead and posted the video on YouTube anyway.

And she also manages to joke about the incident on her Facebook page where she has gathered quite a following.
