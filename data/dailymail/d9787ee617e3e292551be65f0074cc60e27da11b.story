Fraud is costing the NHS up to £5billion a year – the equivalent of 250,000 nurses or the entire annual budget for cancer, a report claims.

Dentists charging for patients who do not exist, or drugs being stolen and sold on eBay are just two examples of the corruption.

A further £2billion could be missing due to financial error, it is claimed.

Emergency: A fraud expert says Government figures underestimate level of loss in the NHS from corruption

The Government records the level of fraud against the NHS at £229million a year – but an expert will tell BBC's Panorama that this is a wild underestimate.

Jim Gee, a former director of NHS Counter Fraud Services, says this total does not include examples of fraud such as NHS staff being paid for hours they did not work, or private companies over-charging trusts for operations and other services.

He told Panorama that the true level of fraud could be more than 20 times the government estimate.

He said comparisons with other countries' health systems had led him to believe that healthcare fraud takes £5billion away from caring for patients in the UK.

This would be enough to pay for 68,000 new consultants or 244,000 new nurses. The total is the equivalent of the entire NHS bill for cancer services.

Professor Mark Button, of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at the University of Portsmouth, said the increase in private sector firms doing work for the NHS had played a part in the rise.

Panorama uncovered a whole array of fraud, with stolen medical products being sold on eBay and a GP using patient records to obtain prescriptions for their drug addiction. Other examples include dentists claiming for work they have not done.

Mr Gee said he had studied 15 years' worth of international fraud and error figures. If the NHS is in line with other health systems around the world, it would mean it has lost between 7 and 15 per cent of its budget each year to fraud.

'The NHS budget is around £100billion, so that would equate to around £7billion lost,' he said.

More than £5billion is down to fraud, with the rest being financial error, he said. If the figures are right, that is around £14million every day.

'If the NHS was only losing  £229million a year it would be doing 30 times better than any other healthcare organisation in the world, something I think is completely implausible,' he said.

And he pointed out that the figures only relate to pharmaceutical and dental services, and ignore the losses that might be taking place in payroll or procurement expenditure.

The Department of Health told Panorama that it 'did not recognise' Mr Gee's figures.

The frauds unveiled by Panorama included Joyce Trail, a dentist in Birmingham who visited care homes and used residents' details to claim payment from the NHS for work she had not done.

In court, it was revealed that she had defrauded the NHS out of £1.4million. She was jailed in 2012 for seven years.

The figures were the result of research by BDO LLP and the University of Portsmouth’s Centre for Counter Fraud Services
