A distraught father threw himself to his death four days after failing to save his wife from dying in a fall during a family holiday, an inquest heard yesterday.

Roger and Mathilde Lamb had been staying in a rented apartment in Morocco with their children, who were left orphaned.

First Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, slipped and fell 60ft from the apartment window during the night.

Four days later her grieving husband, who had previously suffered from depression, leapt to his death at a nearby hotel.

Mr Lamb, a structural engineer, was found at the bottom of the stairs and died from his injuries the next day.

It was his second suicide attempt following her death.

He had previously walked into the sea wearing a rucksack full of rocks, 
but was rescued and taken to hospital.

An inquest into both deaths heard
that Mr Lamb, 47, committed suicide after seeing his wife fall.

In a statement from one of the couple’s children, the hearing was told 
that Mrs Lamb, 43, had slipped from the window sill in the middle of the
night.

The child, who cannot be named, woke to find the apartment 
filled with police.

They said: ‘I asked my dad what happened and he said that mum had fallen out of the window to her death.

Mr Lamb had taken a job in New Zealand, although his wife had visited friends said that she had been reluctant to join them

‘He said there was a lot of banging going on downstairs and mum had gone to the window in the living room to see what it was.

‘She had stood on the sofa and put her foot on the wooden railing across the window, and had then fallen.

‘Dad said he had rushed to stop her but hadn’t managed to catch her feet and she had fallen.’

After the couple’s death last August,
in the Moroccan coastal town of Essaouira,  the Lambs’ family denied 
reports the couple had been arguing.

But the inquest was told their 19-year marriage was ‘on a knife-edge’ amid financial concerns and a 
disagreement over whether to move from their £850,000 country home in 
Pensham, Worcestershire, to start a new life in New Zealand, where Mr 
Lamb had been working.

His sister, Zara Bird, told the inquest in a statement: ‘Divorce had been spoken of but neither could decide.’

Mr Lamb was described as ‘suicidally 
low’ before the holiday and it was said that he had a history of mental 
health issues and had been prescribed antidepressants in New Zealand.

After Mrs Lamb’s death her sister, 
Charlotte Sebag-Montefiore, flew to Morocco. She described Mr Lamb as 
being very tearful and in ‘a state of shock’.

Tilly told friends that Roger had become 'obsessed' with Gypsy life, and wanted the couple to become new age travellers

Mrs Sebag-Montefiore’s husband Rupert
is chairman of the estate agent Savills and brother of the historian 
Simon Sebag-Montefiore.

His wife, Santa, and her sister, Tara 
Palmer-Tomkinson, are friends of the Prince of Wales.

Mrs Sebag-Montefiore said that he had
been getting progressively better before his death. She told the 
inquest: ‘At breakfast he was unbelievably well. He had three or four 
courses, pancakes, chocolate, cake.

‘He went upstairs to go to get his 
swimming stuff. He just seemed a lot more positive. I stayed downstairs 
to have a cappuccino when a receptionist screamed “Madam”.

‘We ran out and he was lying at the bottom of the stairs.’

Undamaged: The balustraded window from which 
Tilly Lamb fell to her death (right) and the view from outside the third
floor apartment in Essaouira. Local police believe the wooden 
balustrade gave way - but the Mail found no sign of damage to the window
nor any sign of recent repairs being carried out

Spacious: The £30-per-night flat is still being let out to holidaymakers despite the criminal inquiry

Coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, 
David Ridley, ruled that the names, ages, gender and number of the 
Lambs’ children could not be reported.

He recorded a verdict of accidental death for Mrs Lamb on August 17 last year and a verdict of suicide for her husband.
