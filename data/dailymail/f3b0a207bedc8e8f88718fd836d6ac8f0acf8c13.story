Manny Pacquiao says Floyd Mayweather has nowhere left to hide and has no option but to fight him.

Speculation that the richest fight in boxing history is close to being made has been rife since the Pacman put on an impressive performance to defeat Chris Algieri in Macau last month.

Speaking in Las Vegas last week, Mayweather was asked about the fight – which could be the most lucrative in the sport's history – and said:  'Will I fight Pacquiao? Absolutely.'

And now the Filipino has tweeted: 'Don't be a boxing humbug. Let's give the fans the fight they want. They have waited long enough.'

He (Mayweather) has reached a dead end,' Pacquiao told Sky Sports. 'He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep.'

'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.'

While the fight could gross around $300million (£190.4m) Pacquiao says the money is not important and he would take on the fight for free.

'Mayweather can get the amount he wants,' Pacquiao added. 'I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing.'
