She has refused all attempts to move her and continues to live alone in the Siberian wilderness as she has done all her life.

Although Agafya Lykova wants to stay in the wooden shack she was born in, the hermit has asked for a small gift from officials during her latest contact with the outside world - a new goat and some boots.

Agafya, 68, is the last surviving member of the Old Believer Lykov family who fled from Stalin's religious persecution into the Siberian taiga in 1936.

Rehomed: Agafya gave two kittens in exchange for supplies. Bagira, pictured, has been given to new family

They did not see another human being until 1978 when a team of geologists stumbled across their self-built home.

Her family, father Karp Iosifovich, mother Akulina, brothers Savvin and Dmitry and sister Natalya have all since died but Agafya refuses to move.

Rangers visited her last month and she asked for a new cockerel, a goat and some boots.

She also asked that they take two kittens - a male and female - back with them. The animals are descendants of cats taken by the family when they fled into the forest.

Agafya, who was born in the forest, asked for the gifts in exchange for the cats and instead of a medal 'For Belief and Kindness' that Aman Tuleyev, Governor of the Kemerovo region wanted to give her. 

She was quoted in the Siberian Times 
as saying: 'My old cock stopped crowing, please can I have a new one? 
Also my old goat died and I need another one.

Survivor: Agafya, pictured with her sister Natalia, is the only member of her family still alive

Home: The Lykov family lived in this hand-built log cabin in the depths of the Siberian taiga

'And another thing please can I have new boots. I am feeling well thank you. Do say hello to governor Aman Tuleyev.'

The rangers said she is well but is struggling more than ever to manage in her home. They helped with repairs during the visit by helicopter and chopped some firewood.

One of the cats - a black female called Bagira - has been rehomed and it is hoped the male cat will be found a home soon.

Agafya has lived alone since 1988 when her father died.

Savvin, 45, Dmitry, 36, and Natalya, 42, all died in 1981 and her mother died in 1961.

Family: Karp Lykov, second left, with Dmitry and Agafya, and a Soviet geologist in the 1970s

Wilderness: The family fled Stalinist persecution and set up home in the remote Siberia taiga (file picture)

They fled after the Stalinist regime began persecuting Christians, including Old Believers - a fundamentalist Russian orthodox sect which had been persecuted since the days of Peter the Great in the early 18th century.

When they were discovered by the geologists, the family - apart from Karp - had never seen bread and they spoke in a blurred and distorted language.

Their clothes were repaired using hemp cloth and one harsh winter had been reduced to eating leather shoes.

But despite the hardship, Agafya has continued to live at the family home and now has two nanny goats, a male goat, eight cats, a rooster, hens and a dog called Taiga.
