Abu Hamza is accused of using London¿s notorious Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting base for his creed of violent jihad

Abu Hamza claims he secretly ‘kept the streets of London  safe’ as a go-between for MI5 and Scotland Yard, a US court heard.

The extraordinary image of the hook-handed Muslim firebrand as a force for religious peace in Britain was laid out in a Manhattan courtroom by his defence lawyer.

Some 50 pages of documents passed on by Britain would prove the police and security services turned to Hamza to help combat Islamic extremism between May 1997 and August 2000, defence lawyer Joshua Dratel said.

‘They take in every conflict we are talking about in this case. Algeria, Bosnia, Yemen, Afghanistan, the Finsbury Park mosque are all central to this case,’ he said.

‘He takes a certain position publicly but his intent is to de-escalate, to avoid a greater war, to keep the streets of London safe.

‘He is an intermediary, he has done this for Scotland Yard and MI5. They have asked him multiple times to act in hostile situations and return some order in the community.’

Mr Dratel said Hamza had helped repeatedly when British nationals had been involved or arrested in conflicts abroad.

The claims contrast starkly with prosecutors’ claims that the 56-year-old former nightclub bouncer posed as a community leader while actually engaging in a ‘global campaign to spread terror’.

Hamza, who is accused of using London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting base for his creed of violent jihad, stared across the court today at one of his alleged victims.

New Zealander Mary Quin escaped a 1998 kidnapping of 16 mostly British tourists in the Yemen.

Three Britons and an Australian were killed in the subsequent gun battle with Yemeni soldiers, and Hamza is accused of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone and offering to be their go-between.

Miss Quin described how she flew to London in 2000 and confronted Hamza outside the mosque, demanding to find out more about the hostage-taking.

She said he eventually took her to his office, where, as children played under his desk, he told her he was ‘surprised, very surprised’ she had come.

The radical cleric, who lost both his hands in Afghanistan and has had his hooks removed during the trial, is accused of 11 counts including trying to set up a terror training camp in Oregon

In the conversation, a recording of which was played in court, he freely told her that the kidnappers’ leader had rung him during the kidnapping, which had been carried out to secure the release of Muslim hostages held by the Yemenis.

They included five British men, one of whom was Hamza’s son and another was his stepson.

Hamza even claimed that the leader of the kidnappers, Abu Hassan of the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, was a ‘very soft-hearted person’, the court heard.

He then baldly informed Miss Quin that the alternative to taking them hostage would have been to blow up their cars with a rocket launcher.

He refused to say if he had known about the kidnapping in advance but claimed the hostage takers had never expected anyone would get hurt.

Today in court he came face-to-face with one of his alleged victims, Mary Quin, who escaped a 1998 kidnapping after wrestling a rifle from one of her captors

The jury was also played a Channel 4 News interview with Hamza, in which he admitted he would ‘love’ for the Yemeni regime to be overthrown.

Hamza, wearing a blue smock and track suit bottoms, peered intently at his accuser as he sat with a female lawyer on either side of him. He has had his hooks removed for safety reasons but he is allowed a pen-holding prosthetic on his right arm.

The Egyptian-born imam, who was extradited to the US in 2012, denies 11 charges, including planning to set up a terror training camp in Oregon and being involved in the Yemen kidnapping.

If found guilty, he faces a life sentence.

The trial continues.
