Wayne Rooney claims England’s players are 100 per cent behind Roy Hodgson, as the manager prepares to hand Fabian Delph a shock start in Monday night’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Hodgson has lost the support of the country following the disastrous World Cup campaign and is under pressure to secure a result against an emerging Swiss side at St Jakob-Park.

The England boss is set to give Delph his full debut in a 4-3-3 formation. The Aston Villa midfielder has played just 21 minutes of senior international football, after replacing Jack Wilshere against Norway at Wembley last Wednesday.

Doubt: Jordan Henderson could miss the Three Lions' Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on Monday night

Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Delph are expected to be the three in England’s midfield as Hodgson attempts to add some more muscle in that area, while Danny Welbeck is in for injured Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge.

Henderson was taken off in training on Sunday night with an injury to his right leg, but Hodgson is hopeful the Liverpool man will be fit. James Milner would be the likely replacement if Henderson fails to recover.

Captain Rooney said: ‘Us as a team, not just myself, we back Roy 100 per cent.

‘We made that clear after we went out of the World Cup — he brings ideas to us.

‘We know that the World Cup was a disappointment, but I still feel we can move forward as a team

'We're progressing all the time. I think that will show in the next two years. The lads are working hard to get the best out of the ideas Roy is showing us.'

This is the most turbulent period of Hodgson's two-year spell in charge of the national team and his new-look team will face a big test against Vladimir Petkovic's side.

Hodgson insisted on Sunday he wasn't interested in taking part in a popularity contest with the nation and that's just as well given the criticism following Wednesday's 1-0 victory over Norway.

England's head coach claimed he wanted respect from his players when he spoke ahead of their final training session before this Euro 2016 qualifier.

Hodgson added: 'Popularity doesn't really mean much to me. I've never been interested with being popular with players. Am I seeing the nasty side of the job? No. There is no nasty side.

'I love this job. It's a magnificent job. It's the pinnacle of any coaching career.

'After the World Cup and the enormous disappointment that followed, there may have been a slight swing in popularity and I'd have been surprised had there not been.

'I want to be respected by the players for the job I do. That's all that bothers me.' 

England's head coach also claimed he has never been a calm figure and admitted he is prone to moments of anger in the dressing room and out on the training pitch.

Hodgson claims he was surprised by the reaction after he claimed a statistic that England only had two shots on target against Norway was 'absolute f****** bollocks'. They also had six shots blocked.

He added: 'First of all, I'm not a calm person, never have been a calm person. Secondly, as any player who has worked with me would attest, there are always moments of extreme anger and viciousness in my coaching session.

'What astounds me is you're trying to tell me this having not seen it. I don't understand how anything I did in that training session (on Friday) could be seen as 'anger'. I'd rather be accused of being a bit over robust in response to questions I didn't agree with.

'But is Roy Hodgson an angry person, has he got a nasty streak? You wouldn't have to go too far to prove it. The players would come out of the woodwork in no time. I've never sought popularity. I like to consider myself a good professional, a good coach and someone who believes in his players. 

'It's unusual for me to get angry with my players because I protect them. If I'm guilty of anything the other night, it was of protecting players from unfair criticism and standing up for them.

'But be careful of stereo-typing me too much as a calm, collected person.'
