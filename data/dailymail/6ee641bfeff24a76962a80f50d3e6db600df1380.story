Arsene Wenger admitted Arsenal paid for their first-leg collapse as they crashed out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage for the fifth successive season.

Their 3-1 first-leg defeat by Monaco at the Emirates came back to haunt them as they clinched a 2-0 win last night that sent them out on away goals.

Wenger said: ‘Football is not a fairytale. It’s just a matter of being realistic and clinical and Monaco were clinical in front of goal and maybe a bit lucky as well.

‘The performance was enough today and it could have been over at half time with the chances we had.

‘We knew before the game we had a 98 per chance to go out. We did fight but I felt some players were jaded offsnsively as they gave a lot on Saturday and lacked bit of freshness.

‘Overall we paid for the first game when we didn’t produce the game we wanted. But when Monaco played at home they had zero shots on target.’

Olivier Giroud’s 36th minute goal and Aaron Ramsey’s strike in 79th minute gave Arsenal hope in a night on which they attacked throughout and did their utmost – but ultimately the damage had been done at The Emirates.

Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny said: ‘We say the same thing every year. Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right... play well in two games’

Wenger added: ‘It’s difficult to compare to the previous years because before we played against Bayern and Barcelona. We’re very disappointed to be out tonight but overall we’re on positive trend and this game on line with what we did recently

‘I would separate it from other years in which we have gone out. We’re very disappointed to be out of course bu there were a lot of positives in the games. But overall situation is very disappointing

Captain Per Mertesacker said: ``The best team went through. They deserved it because they played much better in the first leg. We had to come back from a massive deficit. We played well today but it wasn’t enough.

‘You come here and try absolutely everything. You look at the game and we could have scored more than two. We don’t look back to the first game - that was already over - and we tried to do our best today but it wasn’t enough.’
