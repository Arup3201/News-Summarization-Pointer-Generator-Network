Boost: Germany appears to have backed David Cameron's idea for a 'two-speed' Europe

David Cameron’s bid to cut a new deal for Britain with Brussels received a major boost yesterday when Germany publicly backed the idea of a ‘two-speed Europe’.

In a significant step, the powerful German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said he accepted British demands that EU countries outside the Eurozone would need special protections in future.

‘As long as the UK will not join the Eurozone, maybe we can find a two-state solution,’ he said.

In a joint article with the Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Schauble spelled out Germany’s vision of how Eurozone countries could pursue deeper political and monetary union, while ensuring ‘fairness’ for EU countries like Britain that remain outside.

Downing Street welcomed his intervention, saying it showed Germany had accepted that the UK and other states outside the euro needed special protections written into the EU treaties rather than fighting their corner on a case-by-case basis.

Germany is pushing for closer union within the Eurozone to prevent a repeat of the crisis that nearly destroyed the single currency.

But British ministers warn they are already engaged in hand to hand combat in Brussels to protect key British interests in areas like regulation of the City. They fear that strengthening the Eurozone would create a powerful voting bloc that would leave the UK at a permanent disadvantage.

Ministers now hope that Mr Schauble’s words could eventually lead to a wider change to qualified majority voting, in which changes would have to be agreed by a majority of non-euro states, as well as by those in the euro.

But the plan still faces major hurdles, with France resistant to a major shake-up in the EU’s treaties, particularly if it would benefit Britain.

In their article in the Financial Times yesterday, Mr Schauble and Mr Osborne said any changes to EU treaties must ‘guarantee fairness’ for member states outside the euro.

They wrote: ‘The UK fully recognises 
the progress made so far in responding to the crisis, and it supports 
the case for further steps forward. But as the euro area continues to 
integrate, it is important that countries outside the euro area are not 
at a systematic disadvantage in the EU,” they wrote.

‘So
 future EU reform and treaty change must include reform of the 
governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal 
basis, and guarantee fairness for those EU countries inside the single 
market but outside the single currency.’

Downing Street welcomed the shift from Berlin. A spokesman said: What we see is Germany, one of the leading players in the eurozone, accepting that there needs to be these proper safeguards put in place as further changes are made for the eurozone.

'That is one of the important reforms we want to see to the European Union.’

Asked whether the development meant it would be easier for Mr Cameron to achieve his plans for a renegotiation followed by a referendum by 2017, the spokesman said: ‘There are a number of reforms we would like to see to the EU, but making sure that the UK and other countries outside the eurozone remain on a level playing field is vitally important.’

But some Tory MPs - and many members of the public - remain sceptical about Mr Cameron’s chances of achieving major reform before holding a promised In/Out referendum in 2017.

A major poll conducted for the former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft yesterday revealed that only one in five voters is confident the Prime Minister can secure a good deal.

Tory MP Mark Reckless welcomed the close-co-operation between Mr Osborne and his German counterpart, but warned: ‘The Germans aren’t going to remake the EU to suit the UK and even the prospect of treaty change seems to be receding.’

Fellow Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell said it was ‘just like the 1990s all over again’, when Brussels paid lip service to British demands for more powers to be handed back to national parliaments.
