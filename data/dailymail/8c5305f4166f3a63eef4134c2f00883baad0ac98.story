Re-examination of a 100,000-year-old human skull found 35 years ago in Northern China suggests they were closer than thought in physiology to Neanderthals.

A study has revealed the surprising presence of an inner-ear formation long thought to occur only in Neanderthals.

And it lends further credence to the theory that Neanderthals were wiped out through interbreeding with other humans.

A skull in China has been found with a trait once thought unique to Neanderthals. The Xujiayao 15 temporal bone is shown here with the extracted temporal labyrinth, an inner-ear formation thought long gone by 100,000 years ago. It is also shown with its position in the temporal bone

They
 are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals 
were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a previous study by the University of Colorado Museum and Leiden University suggests.

Instead,
 it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of 
interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, 
scientists believe.

An
 analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years stripped 
away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and revealed they were 
more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought.

The
 differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their 
own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals, said the US and Dutch
 researchers.

Interbreeding
 could be one reason why Neanderthals vanished, according to the 
scientists. They were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated.

Evidence
 of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record. Some human-like 
characteristics have been found in late Neanderthal fossils, and 
conversely, Neanderthal features have been seen in early specimens of 
modern humans in Europe.

Study co-author Erik Trinkaus, PhD, a physical anthropology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the discovery 'places into question' how humans from the Pleistocene period (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) dispersed.

'It suggests, instead, that the later phases of human evolution were more of a labyrinth of biology and peoples than simple lines on maps would suggest,' he said.

The study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is based on recent micro-CT scans of a fossilised human skull found during 1970s excavations at the Xujiayao site in China’s Nihewan Basin.

'We were completely surprised,' Trinkaus contiued.

'We fully expected the scan to reveal a temporal labyrinth that looked much like a modern human one, but what we saw was clearly typical of a Neanderthal.'

Instead the researchers found an arrangement of semicircular canals in the ear that places into question whether this was unique to Neanderthals.

The 
presence of this particular arrangement of the semicircular canals in 
the temporal labyrinth had previously been considered enough to securely
 identify fossilised skull fragments as being from a Neanderthal.

This
 pattern is present in almost all of the known Neanderthal labyrinths. 
It has been widely used as a marker to set them apart from both earlier 
and modern humans.

The
 discovery the later humans have the same trait, however, could now call
 into question whether other fossilised remains truly belonged to 
Neanderthals.

And it also raises more questions about where Neanderthals lived, as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in Europe

The skull at the centre of this study, known as Xujiayao 15, was found along with an assortment of other human teeth and bone fragments, all of which seemed to have characteristics typical of an early non-Neanderthal form of late archaic humans.

Trinkaus, who has studied Neanderthal and early human fossils from around the globe, said this discovery only adds to the rich confusion of theories that attempt to explain human origins, migrations patterns and possible interbreedings.

'The study of human evolution has always been messy, and these findings just make it all the messier,' Trinkaus said.

'It shows that human populations in the real world don’t act in nice simple patterns.'

Trinkaus also explains how migration patterns between Eastern Asia and Western Europe took thousands of years to play out, further complicating matters.

'This study shows that you can’t rely on one anatomical feature or one piece of DNA as the basis for sweeping assumptions about the migrations of hominid species from one place to another,' he concluded.

The discovery of this skull in Asia, rather than Europe, also raises more questions about where Neanderthals lived, as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in Europe. Shown is a map of their distribution in the times they were believed to inhabit Earth
