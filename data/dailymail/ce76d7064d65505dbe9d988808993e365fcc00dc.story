First published in 1923, it’s a magazine that has adorned many coffee tables for decades since - and given us a fascinating insight into broadcasting over the past nine decades.

Now an exhibition at the Museum of London will soon showcase 90 years of the Radio Times, with memorable covers including the 1966 World Cup, EastEnders launch in 1985 and George VI’s coronation in 1937.

Also included in the set is the magazine’s first issue from September 28 1923, the first Christmas issue from the same year - and the award-winning Doctor Who ‘Vote Dalek’ cover from 2005.

Famous dates: This front-cover through a window was for George VI's coronation on 7 April 1937 (left). The other for 9 August 1940 (right) is 'Bombers over Germany'

Other highlights include a 1941 Luftwaffe map, which plots the magazine’s printing plant in Park Royal, north-west London, as a Nazi air-raid target along with transport hubs, factories and landmarks.  

Radio Times staff had been moved there from central London when the Second World War began - and the plant became a strategically-important target as part of the war on propaganda.

The map - showing the plant which also printed fellow BBC magazine The Listener - was found by U.S. air force intelligence officer Captain Andrew Wilson at the Fritzlar airbase in Germany in 1944.

The exhibition also features a Doctor Who display - a Radio Times regular since 1964 - and visitors will be able to put themselves into a photograph of the ‘Vote Dalek’ cover against a backdrop of Westminster Bridge.

Iconic: The Charlie Chaplin cover from 10 October 1952 (left) is joined in the exhibition by the World Cup cover from 7 July 1966 - the year England won the competition

Sports and comedy: The Wimbledon cover from 29 June 1967 (left) marked the summer which saw the first colour broadcast to air on British TV - the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The Morecambe & Wise cover from 3 January 1976 (right) is also seen

The front-page was voted most iconic cover ever by the Periodical Publishers Association in 2008.

'To flick through the covers of Radio Times over the past 90 years is to watch a popular history of Britain unfold'

Ben Preston, Radio Times editor

Radio Times editor Ben Preston said: ‘To flick through the covers of Radio Times over the past 90 years is to watch a popular history of Britain unfold.

‘Royal weddings, coronations, the outbreak of war and peace, moon landings and even a victorious World Cup, household names created and stars born - all have graced the cover of Radio Times.

‘No other magazine can rival Radio Times for showcasing the work of some of the nation’s finest artists and photographers, creating unforgettable magazine covers that resonate today.’

Historic: London street map printed for use by Luftwaffe pilots. Colour-coded bombing targets - including the Radio Times print works in Park Royal, north-west London, have been printed on the map in red and purple. It covers an area from Ealing in the West to Islington in the East, Hampstead in the North and Westminster in the South

Museum of London director Sharon Ament added: ‘Some of the most momentous moments from Radio Times’ considerable cannon will be on our walls.

'No sitting room was without this magazine - it was a weekly ritual to pore over its pages'

Sharon Ament, Museum of London director

‘That’s not only rather splendid but totally apt as this publication has its roots in London and has been a large part of much of our culture for the past 90 years. 

‘No sitting room was without this magazine - it was a weekly ritual to pore over its pages.’

The magazine, which has been owned by Immediate Media since 2011, now sells almost 900,000 copies a week.
