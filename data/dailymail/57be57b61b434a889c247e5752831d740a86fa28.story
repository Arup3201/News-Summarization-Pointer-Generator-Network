A record £161m worth of assets, including watches, diamonds, sports cars and other luxury goods was seized by criminals in Britain last year, it has been revealed.

The Home Office revealed the record recovery of stolen goods after announcing plans for a new strategy to tackle organised crime, which is said to cost the UK up to £40bn a year.

Diamond earrings, designer clothing and fine china were also among the items recovered in Britain last year in the biggest recovery since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

Officials say there are an estimated 38,000 organised criminals active in Britain today, working in 6,000 groups involved in the drugs trade, human trafficking, child exploitation and cybercrime.

Many are also involved in more conventional areas of crime such as organised vehicle theft and armed robbery.

As part of the figures for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in 2010/11, the Home Office said law enforcement agencies recovered, froze or returned over £1bn worth of criminal assets.

A further £49m was returned to victims, while around £831m in assets were denied to criminals in the same period.

Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Organised crime has a local impact, but a global reach.

'The reality is, it seems as if it's very distant, but actually it's very real.'

The
organised crime strategy, to be published today, promises to make a 
difference by 'ensuring a co-ordinated national approach across 
government, law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies'.

Mr Brokenshire said the impact of 
criminal activity can be seen on the streets through drug dealing and 
affects people by online fraud.

He told the BBC: 'Part of the 
challenge I think, is to ensure that we follow the cash, follow the 
proceeds of those who are involved in organised crime in whatever form 
it may take, and ensuring those who are involved don't gain from the 
benefit of being involved in criminality.

'There
are issues of money laundering, and then whether it be buying property,
buying fancy cars and actually denying those criminals those assets and
ensuring that they realise the police and other agencies will really 
follow through on this.

'There are freezing orders that can be obtained. Actually ensuring that the criminals, whilst we may not be able to realise the cash from the immediately, part of what we're doing is how we can speed up that process from having identified that assets are linked to say an organised crime group to ensure that they don't have the benefit of it.'

He said the Organised Crime Strategy was looking into assets kept abroad and police are looking into 'sophisticated elements' like the front companies, and working with the tax authorities and insolvency authorities.
