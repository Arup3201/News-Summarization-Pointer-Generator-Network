She made her name with We Need To Take About Kevin, a book about a mass-murderer's mother's struggle to accept her son's killings.

The novel that was turned down by 30 publishers before Serpent's Tail launched it to cult status was adapted to a hit film starring Tilda Swinton.

And now edgy writer Lionel Shriver is back with another shocking book, but this one is a lot closer to home.

Big Brother tells the story of Pandora, a middle-aged woman who moves in with her obese older brother, Edison, to help him lose weight on an extreme liquid diet.

Her very own older sibling Greg was obese, weighing 24 stone at his heaviest. He suffered from diabetes, was reliant on a portable oxygen tank, and died of cardiac arrest in 2002.

Despite the apparent similarities Shriver professes the family in Big Brother bears no resemblance to her own.

Unsurprisingly for someone who has experienced such tragedy, Shriver is in unbelievably good shape for her 55 years - the same age her brother was when he died.

She admits to embarking on a torturous diet and exercise regime in an interview with Grazia, and reveals some eccentric views on life and health.

'We are meant to be hungry,' she says.

'It's more exciting and enjoyable to be striving for something than to actually get it.'

She cycles everywhere and has a meticulous daily exercise regime consisting of 130 press-ups, 200 side crunches, 500 sit-ups and 3,000 star jumps.

Even with all this exercise to consider Shriver still doesn't eat anywhere near enough food to actually put weight on, skipping lunch entirely in favour of a bowl of popcorn.

Somewhat haunted by obesity, Shriver wards the disease away from herself while indulging in voyeuristic television on the topic.

'Over the years I've watched an appalling number of TV shows like half Ton Man and Embarrassing Bodies - I'm a real sucker for all that.'

While she puts pressure on herself to stay slim, she doesn't believe women should be pushed to extremes by the media.

'I would rather see models weigh a little more,' she tells Grazia.

I'm especially antagonistic to computer-fiddling.

'So not only do you take women who are improbably thin to begin with but then you start shaving away bits of them until there's not even room for their intestines anymore.'
