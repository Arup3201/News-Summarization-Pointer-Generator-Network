A former champion kickboxer has drowned in mysterious circumstances after apparently falling off his boat on a day trip with his two young children.

Mark Selbee, 45, went overboard and didn't resurface after taking his brand new boat out onto Hillsdale Lake in Miami County, Kansas.

His wife Amy first learned of the tragedy when their eldest daughter rang from the boat to say that her father had gone under the water.

'Solid muscle': Former champion kickboxer Mark Selbee drowned after apparently falling off his motorboat in front of his two young children

Tragedy: Mr Selbee's three children Easton, Ellie Brooke and Hudson. He had taken two of them out on the boat when he drowned. It has not been reported which two, although it is thought to be the eldest

A fisherman later found the unmanned motorboat with the two children on board.

Mr Selbee, who won four championships with the International Kickboxing Federation before retiring in 2006, was found around 27 hours later after searchers used sonar to locate his body 20ft under the water.

It is not clear whether he fell off the boat or went for a swim and got into difficulty.

David Oblas, an Atlanta kickboxing promoter who has known Mr Selbee for 15 years, told The Kansas City Star: 'I think everyone is shocked because no-one has found out exactly what happened.

Mystery: It is not clear whether the he fell off the boat or went for a swim and got into difficulty, although a friend said it was unlikely he would have intentionally left the children alone in the boat

'Mark was solid muscle. Not only was he a great athlete, he had an extreme determination.'

Another friend, Jarrod Townsend, told Fox News: 'Mark had been swimming for exercise in the mornings.

'He was the kind of superman that could take anything.'

Mr Selbee was raised in Topeka but moved with his wife and three children - Easton, Ellie Brooke and Hudson - to Leawood about five months ago to be closer to family.

Autopsy results are expected to be revealed today.
