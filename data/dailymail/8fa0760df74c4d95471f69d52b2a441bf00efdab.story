Police in Florida are on the hunt for a suspect in a hit-and-ran crash involving a pregnant woman who was left injured.

Sheriff’s deputies in Holiday say Crystal Lynn Noordhuizen, 32, who is seven months pregnant, was struck by a car Monday afternoon.

According to investigators, the driver of the vehicle has been identified as 33-year-old Justin Lee Colby, who is believed to be her half-brother.

Deputies say Colby mowed down the woman, who is seven months pregnant, with his white 2006 Dodge Charger, which he then slammed into a pole 

Deputies told the station WFLA Noordhuizen was walking east on Westwood Drive’s south shoulder at around 1pm when Colby 'traveled off the roadway' and hit her.

After striking the mother-to-be, Colby crashed his white 2006 Dodge Charger into a pole.

He then walked to his home located on the same street, hopped on a white motorcycle and took off from the scene.

Crystal Noordhuizen was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for minor injuries.

As of Monday night, police have not apprehended Justin Colby, who has a long criminal history dating back to at least 2006.

The 33-year-old man has been arrested at least eight times over the past nine years on a wide variety of charges, including aggravated assault; domestic violence; sex battery of a minor; possession and sale of controlled substances, and multiple probation violations.

According to her Facebook page, Miss Noordhuizen and her alleged attacker appears to be related: both the 32-year-old woman and Justin Colby list a man by the name Dave Colby as their father, suggesting that they are siblings.

In 2007, then-25-year-old Justin Colby made headlines when he was arrested for repeatedly having sex with a 15-year-old girl and plying her with drugs.

Five years later, the troubled Holiday man landed behind bars again following a violent family feud reminiscent of Monday's incident involving his pregnant sister.

In April 2012, Tampa Bay Times reported that Colby was arrested for hitting his brother, Daniel Colby, with his car following a brawl during which the siblings hurled a variety of household items at one another, including cutlery, a toaster and a crowbar.

According to a police report, then-27-year-old Daniel Colby told officers he thought his big brother just wanted to scare him by pretending to run him over with a car and was going to swerve at the last second.

But Justin Colby did not stop the car to miss his brother, who suffered a broken knee after being thrown over the car's hood.

At the time, Justin Colby denied striking his sibling on purpose and claimed that Daniel jumped onto the hood of his car.
