A family watched in horror as a ‘bull terrier’ mauled their Chihuahua puppy to death during one of her first walks off the lead.

Elvi Richardson, 21, was devastated after her puppy Lexi was attacked by a ‘bull terrier-type’ dog in woods near her home.

Her younger brother Conor, 14, and grandmother Nicky Richardson, 62, were taking Lexi for one of her first walks off the lead when she was set upon.

Nicky Richardson told yesterday of the horrific moment when the terrier clamped its jaws on Lexi.

She said: ‘It just charged from about 15 yards away and went for her.

‘It just picked her up and bit her in its mouth, I was thumping it on the head with my hand and I was just screaming saying “no, no, no”. I was just so angry, it wouldn’t let go.

‘It was horrible. It got hold of her and she was screeching, I’ve still got that picture in my mind. It has broken Elvi’s heart.’

By the time the dog finally let go, the puppy was fatally injured and died in Miss Richardson’s arms after she arrived at the park by car.

Amazingly, after the incident, the owner of the black and white terrier said it was their fault as Lexi was not on a lead and refused to apologise.

Police are now investigating the incident which happened on a field at Colwick Woods, Nottingham, at around 6.15pm on August 31.

The RSPCA is also looking into the incident.

Miss Richardson, from Bakersfield, Nottingham, said: ‘I could not believe it. It was horrible, I would not wish the whole thing on my worst enemy.

‘All I ever wanted was a little Chihuahua and then this happens. This was one of her first proper walks.’

A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: ‘This incident must have been deeply distressing for the owner of the puppy.

‘An inspector visited the owner of the dog and gave advice to them on controlling their dog at all times and how to prevent any incident like this happening in the future.

‘At this stage we have no further information on what exactly happened so are unable to comment further.’

A Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said the force was investigating the attack to determine whether any crime had been committed under dangerous dog laws. 

She said: ‘Obviously the owner of the dog was very distressed by this incident.’

Last Saturday, a cat known as the ‘honorary mayor’ of an Alaskan town was attacked by a loose dog which left the cat called Stubbs with a punctured lung, bruised hips, a long deep gash on his side and a sternum fractured to the point it might need to be repaired with a plate.

Stubbs underwent three hours of surgery after the attack and his treatment has cost US$2,000.

In August a 37-year-old woman from Doncaster, South Yorkshire needed 72 stitches in her face after a neighbour's dog attacked her.

Colleen Hutchinson admitted she was lucky to be alive after the Staffordshire bull terrier clamped its jaws around her face in the Wheatley area.

She is now looking at taking legal action against the owners of the dog, Leyland, which was put down after the incident.
