Stamp of approval: The Royal Mail have decided to commemorate Anthony Trollope with a set of stamps ahead of the bicentenary of his birth in December following calls from The Mail on Sunday

A commemorative set of stamps will honour Anthony Trollope – the Victorian novelist who introduced the pillar box to Britain – after an intervention by The Mail on Sunday.

The Royal Mail is to produce the stamps as part of celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the author’s birth in 2015.

The decision comes just days after it said it had no ‘current’ plans to produce a stamp in response to a freedom of information request from this newspaper.

Last night a Royal Mail spokesman said the organisation had decided to look again at the issue in the light of The Mail on Sunday’s original request and subsequent enquiries.

Trollope is best known for his Palliser and Barchester series of novels – and his stories of political and  ecclesiastical intrigue have made  him essential bedtime reading for politicians, peers and members of  the clergy.

His fans include Tory former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, P D James and Ruth Rendell.

Any failure by the Royal Mail to honour the writer – who was also a leading figure with the Victorian postal service – would have been a public relations disaster.

Lord Fellowes said: ‘I am so glad to hear that the Post Office now intends to mark his double centenary. It would have been odd if they had not.

‘I can think of no other instance 
where a world-famous, front-rank novelist has introduced a British icon 
in an entirely different area of our national life.’

He
added: ‘The first pillar boxes were tried in Britain – after he had 
seen them used in France – in 1852, at the urging of Anthony Trollope, 
who was then a Post Office employee.

‘The red pillar box is still with us  
and has long since moved into the company of other British icons,  like 
the double-decker bus and Nelson’s Column.’

Trollope was 19 when he joined the Post Office as a clerk and he wrote as he rose through its ranks to surveyor.

Michael Williamson, chairman of the Trollope Society, welcomed the U-turn and said: ‘The society feels very strongly the bicentenary  of his birth in 2015 would be an appropriate time to remedy this serious omission.’

A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘Royal Mail receives hundreds of requests each year for subjects  of stamps.

‘Clearly, we can’t satisfy all of these. But we have given further consideration to Anthony Trollope, a notable British author, but also a former employee of ours.’
