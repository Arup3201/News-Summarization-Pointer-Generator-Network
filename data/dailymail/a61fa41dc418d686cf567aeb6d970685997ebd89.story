David Cameron could face a vote of no confidence from furious Tory MPs if he fails to defeat UKIP in the Rochester by-election, it emerged today.

Cabinet ministers believe the Prime Minister will face a challenge to his leadership if Tory defector Mark Reckless wins the seat for UKIP.

Mr Cameron has urged Tory activists to join the fight to kick Mr Reckless' 'fat arse' off the Commons benches, but one opinion poll put UKIP nine points ahead in the by-election, expected in late November.

David Cameron has been warned he would face a vote of no confidence in his leadership if the Tories lose the second by-election triggered by Tory defections to UKIP

The Prime Minister is personally furious at Mr Reckless's decision to leave the Tory party, announcing it on the eve of the Tory conference to cause maximum damage.

While Mr Cameron was resigned to the fact that Douglas Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, would win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless' 'betrayal'.

But the PM has vowed to personally lead the fight in Rochester, and will make his first visit to the seat this week.

But he faces warnings that if the Tories lose the seat, his leadership will be called into question.

One Cabinet Minister warns that that 'if Reckless wins Rochester, there'll be 46 names' of Tory MPs forcing a leadership contest, the Mail On Sunday reported..

It would mean Mr Cameron would face a vote of no confidence by his MPs. 'Cameron would win. But it would be very damaging,' the minister added.

The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, but Mr Carswell predicts UKIP will score a second stunning victory.

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'I was down there supporting our excellent candidate Mark Reckless who chose to do the honourable thing and ask voters for their permission. 

'It actually felt a little bit like Clacton - I had lots of people saying to me they don't normally vote, or they normally vote Conservative or Labour, but they look at this guy Reckless… and I think things are going okay there.

'The fact is that Rochester is the 271st most UKIP-y seat in the country, and if we can win there, it looks like we're nine points ahead – it's a tough fight and I think we can do it then it means things are going to look significantly different.'

He added: 'Let's keep a sense of perspective. We have won a single seat. There are 300-and-something to go to get a majority.' 

Douglas Carswell, who last week become UKIP's first elected MP after defecting from the Tories, today predicted his new party would win in Rochester

At an event at the Tory conference, Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'. 

The Tory leader argues that committed volunteers have 'knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them'.

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017.

Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest.

Mr Carswell comfortably won the Clacton by-election on Thursday with a 12,404 majority - a result which the Tories admitted left Ed Miliband in pole position to be the next Prime Minister.

Within hours of the result emerging, Mr Camern said: 'What last night demonstrates is that if you see a big Ukip vote, you will end up with Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, Ed Balls as Chancellor and Labour in power.'

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps added: 'Let me be blunt. What we have seen is a simple truth. This just puts Miliband closer to victory. This has just made his job of getting into Number 10 easier.'

Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP

A new nationwide poll shows support for UKIP has soared to an all-time high 25 per cent – in theory enough for the party to take 128 seats in the Commons. 

The Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday had Labour and the Tories tied on 31 per cent, and the Lib Dems languishing on 8 per cent.

According to John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, the poll would give Labour 253 MPs, Conservatives 187, UKIP 128, Lib Dems 11, and others, including Scots Nats and Ulster MPs, 71.

Prof Curtice said: 'If UKIP are to turn votes into Commons seats in Britain's first-past-the-post system, they need to build up bastions of local strength. Today's poll suggests they may have begun to do that.

'The 25 per cent level represents a 22-point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010. If that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency, they could still fail to pick up a single seat.

'But today's poll suggests UKIP's support has increased much more in the South of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points.

'If that level was recorded throughout the South, UKIP could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points. 

'In that event, Cameron would be left with just 187 seats, almost as weak a position as the Conservatives were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997.
