Jose Enrique shared images on social media of his bike ride and dinner with girlfriend Amy Jaine.

The 28-year-old took time out from pre-season training to spend some quality time with his partner after returning from the US.

The Liverpool defender is working his way back to full fitness ahead of the new season after a knee injury ruined his 2013-14 campaign.

Enrique joined Brendan Rodgers' team on their pre-season tour of the United States and will be looking to win his place in the starting XI back.

Return: The Spaniard enjoyed a lot of playing time during Liverpool's tour of the US

In Enrique's absence last season, Liverpool used loanee Aly Cissokho and Jon Flanagan at left back.

But the Spanish defender is likely to face even further competition for his spot this season, should he stay.

Liverpool are in advanced negotiations with Sevilla over a £16million deal for Alberto Moreno, while Jack Robinson is also developing and has enjoyed a large chunk of playing time in pre-season.

Rodgers' side play their final friendly against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Sunday before they begin their Premier League campaign at home to Southampton a week later on August 17.
