Racing pundit John McCririck was sacked by Channel 4 because bosses didn’t want their own version of ‘unpopular’ Simon Cowell, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Jamie Aitchison, the commissioning editor for sport at Channel 4, said the veteran broadcaster was seen as an irritating ‘comic act’ who brought a ‘farcical tone’ to shows – and insisted the decision to fire him was nothing to do with his age.

Mr Aitchison told the employment tribunal that several viewer surveys found a large section of the audience disliked the 73-year-old, with some describing him as ‘cocky’, ‘a bully,’ ‘arrogant’ and ‘obnoxious’.

Jennifer Eady QC, representing 
McCririck, put it to Mr Aitchison that ‘unpopular’ personalities like 
Simon Cowell boosted ratings.

Mr
Aitchison admitted that using this tactic could work well, but said it 
wasn’t his chosen route to success, adding: ‘I don’t find Simon Cowell 
entertaining.’

Fashion 
presenter Gok Wan was considered for a role covering horse racing by 
Channel 4 bosses in the same revamp that saw pundit John McCririck axed,
an employment tribunal heard today.

The
How To Look Good Naked presenter was under consideration to front a 
fashion segment for the newly revamped Channel 4 racing coverage, the 
hearing into Mr McCririck's ageism claim was told.

Station
executives considered the move while they were deciding how to make 
Channel 4's racing coverage more 'serious' after it was awarded the 
exclusive terrestrial rights to broadcast horse racing - including the 
'Crown Jewels' of Ascot and the Grand National, the tribunal heard.

However, executives from the broadcaster insisted Wan would not have been commentating on races and would only have been used to front fashion segments as part of the racing coverage.

Jamie Aitchison, the channel's commissioning editor for sport, told the hearing: 'Gok Wan is in fashion, that is what he would have been doing.'

Asked if Wan would been commentating on the betting, he said: 'He would be nowhere near that. He was going to do fashion and that was it.'

Earlier in the hearing, Mr Aitchison claimed Mr Cririck was
ditched after 29 years because his 'pantomime' style had compromised 
his credibility, and not because of his age.

McCririck - known for his bling, sideburns and deerstalker - has appeared Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap in recent years.

Tribunal fight: John McCririck, seen here arriving at the employment tribunal hearing with his wife Jenny today, had become a 'comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist', the hearing was told

He is seeking £3million compensation from Channel 4 and production company IMG Media after he was dismissed earlier this year.

Conservative MP Philip Davies today backed McCririck's fight for compensation and branded his sacking a 'catastrophic mistake'.

Mr Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport, told the Central London Employment Tribunal that McCririck was no longer regarded as a serious journalist.

'John McCririck's reputation within the general public, and therefore many potential viewers, had been affected by a number of notorious appearances on a variety of television shows,' he said.

'As a result, he was seen by many as a comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist.'

He said McCririck's persona did not fit in with the programme's new 'serious' image.

'No discrimination': Channel 4 head of sport Jamie Aitchison told the tribunal McCririck was sacked because his persona did not fit with the new serious image of Channel 4's racing coverage

He said: 'John McCririck was considered to have a pantomime style of exaggerated delivery that was incongruous with the more serious, measured style proposed for the programme for 2013.

'It was felt that John McCririck's presenting style would not help Channel 4 Racing appeal to a wider audience, which was critical following the acquisition of extended television rights.'

He said McCririck's style was 'out of step with the vision of the programme, and also unappealing to many potential viewers.'

He
also accused the eccentric pundit - known as 'big Mac' to his fans - of
hogging the limelight from his fellow presenters because he 'loved the 
camera'.

However, Mr Aitchison insisted this had nothing to do with the pundit's age.

He
said: 'None of the decisions taken in respect of who to invite and who 
not to invite to be in the onscreen team for Channel 4 racing from 2013 
were taken on the grounds of their age, or, indeed, for any reason other
than merit, including the decision not to invite back John McCririck.'

Mr
Aitchison phoned McCririck on October 26 last year to tell him he was 
being ditched from the show allegedly just half an hour before an 
official press release was sent out announcing the news.

Support: Philip Davies MP told the hearing that Channel 4's decision to axe McCririck was a 'catastrophic mistake'

However, he revealed televison bosses 'only decided definitely not to include McCririck late on in the planning process'.

He said that the station wanted to bring in younger viewers, not necessarily younger presenters.

Jennifer Eady QC, representing McCririck, said: 'IMG (Media) pitch on the basis that they will attract younger viewers through younger presenters.

'You are scratching around for an explanation for what is plainly the case, which is the majority of people at Channel 4 who attended this presentation said it was given on the basis they were going to bring in younger on-screen talent.'

Mr Aitchison said the reference to 'young and upmarket' was a 'reference to viewers'.

He said they were worried the press would launch a campaign to reinstate the controversial 'love him or loath him' pundit. 

He added that horse racing press officer Hannah Walker, said 'she felt John McCririck would be likely to use the "ageism card" as this was a possibility I had mentioned.

'Another potential consequence Hannah pointed out is that the Racing Post might support any "campaign" John McCririck might embark upon once he had heard the news.

'This was because, as Hannah pointed out, John McCririck is "very much a love or loath person" so it was possible he might garner some support from the press.'

But while the station admit the flamboyant presenter was a hit with some fans, they branded his presenting style as 'pantomime' and outmoded.

And according to some audience surveys, McCririck was least popular presenter with viewers describing him as 'cocky', 'irritating' and a 'bully', the tribunal heard. He added: 'John was also known for using controversial nicknames for his co-presenters and others while on screen.

'For example, John referred to Clare Balding as "ravishing", would call Tanya Stevenson "the female", called Nick Luck 'Lord Snooty' and frequently referred to his own wife as "the Booby".

'John's nicknames for women contributed to a wider reputation he had for making sexist comments and other bizarre behaviour through his appearances on reality television programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap and Ultimate Big Brother.'

His reality TV stints had meant his 'standing in the public eye had suffered', the TV executive said.

And McCririck had a 'propensity to irritate and offend viewers' which meant he was seen as a 'celebrity entertainer and a comedic figure', Mr Aitchison said.

Meanwhile, Mr Davies, MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, threw his support behind McCririck's ageism legal battle.

The MP, a lifelong horse racing fan who used to work in his mother's betting shop, has appeared as a guest on Channel 4's The Morning Line racing preview programme alongside McCririck and is now joint chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on betting and gambling.

He said in a statement to the Central London Employment Tribunal: 'I hold John in the highest regard and believe that he is an expert in his field and an excellent television broadcaster.

'He is probably the only person, apart from Clare Balding, who has reached out to audiences beyond horse racing.

'I'm also of the view that it was a catastrophic mistake when he was dismissed from presenting Channel 4 racing.'

Mr Davies, who is parliamentary spokesman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness, told the tribunal that he 'can't think of anyone who is more on top of the game, nor more suitable to the role' than McCririck.

Channel 4 and IMG Media deny age discrimination.

The hearing continues.
