The four-year-old daughter of NFL Cincinnati Bengals tackle Devon Still, 25, walked the runway on Thursday for New York Fashion Week.

Devon posted a message for his fans on Instagram in June revealing the news that Leah was battling cancer.

Now looking healthier and sporting a cool short hairstyle, Leah made her way down the runway for the Levi's Kids fashion show with Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off' playing in the background.

Fox reports that Devon has been keeping people up to date on Leah's progress via his social media accounts.

On February 7, just days before the fashion show, Devon announced that Leah was released from the hospital after eight days of receiving cancer treatment.

Despite being in and out of the hospital, Leah is doing her best to live her life like any other kid.

Leah watched her dad play against the Browns during the 2014-2015 seasons which was a big highlight of the year but she also got a very special gift.

The Bengals presented a $1.3 million check in her name to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

Devon Still revealed last month that despite his expectations, his 4-year-old daughter's battle with cancer continues.

Leah, who has neuroblastoma, underwent testing last month to measure her progress.

Still was expecting the doctor to declare Leah cancer-free, but that was not the case.

'I wanted to hear so bad that my daughter's cancer was gone and when I didn't it hurt me bad,' Still wrote in the post.

He continued in the post writing that he and his family would 'keep faith and keep fighting no matter what.'

In September, the Bengals cut Still from the team - though they then resigned him to the practice squad so that he would have health insurance - and a $6,300-a-week salary from the team.

Days before Still delivered the sad news, he posted a photo of Leah writing that he was 'praying [doctors] come back and tell me my daughter has no more cancer cells in her body.'

Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in June and has since undergone a series of surgeries.

In September, Leah underwent surgery to remove a tumor, she went through rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, and in November she had stem cell replacement therapy.

Leah's battle with the disease gained national attention early in 2014 when the Bengals cut Still from the roster only to sign him again once they learned of Leah's illness, ABC reports.

Since Leah's battle with cancer began, Still has documented her journey with the disease on social networks. He created the hashtag #LeahStrong, enlisting the support of the public.

When chemotherapy caused the 4-year-old to lose her hair, Still cut off his own hair in an act of support for Leah.

The 25-year-old has raised more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research through appearances and jersey sales, according to WCPO.
