A London-based property agency is promising to find those seeking a house-share the perfect flatmate, with just two small conditions woven into their contracts; they must be young...and they must be rich.

The owner of Capital Living, based in the city's South-West, Adam Goff, describes his unique flat-sharing process as 'a selective living community for people who want to meet new people' which might translate as 'hooking you up with posh flatmates, but only if you're posh yourself'.

Indeed Goff, 30, offers more than just a room in one of his 22 properties, mostly Victorian terraces in places such as Clapham, Balham and Fulham.  

A room to rent with 'cool friends' as part of the package: Adam Goff, 30, founder of Capital Living aims to hook up 'young and rich' professionals in his flatshares across South West London 

Do you come here often? All of the Capital Living properties come with open-plan kitchens to encourage flatmates to chat more freely 

For an average flat-fee of £1,050 a month, tenants can rest assured that their fellow flat-sharers will be somewhere between the ages of 21 to 39 with a flourishing career, often in the City, and a definite predisposition for partying.

Those who have seen the lives of London's richest youngsters in hit television show Made in Chelsea are looking for something similar but don't always know how to get it, says Goff. He told the Times newspaper: 'I don’t think you have to be posh to deal with us, but young and rich is probably a fair assessment.'  

The owner describes the set-up as a 'social experience' and says young professionals in London often need 'someone to sit and watch TV with, go for a beer with, have a takeaway with' when they get home from a hard day at the office. Each property comes with a gas barbecue and a communal kitchen space. 

The company treats potential tenants - or 'members' as they call them - as if they were looking for a membership at an exclusive club such as Soho House with couples banned for fear of killing a flat's sociable atmosphere. They face an interview process at the company's Clapham offices to see whether they 'would fit with our community'.

A cartoon on the company's website tells the story of how Mr Goff was inspired to start his flat-share company by a miserable, friendless experience when he first moved to London from Birmingham

Parties, often a landlord's worst nightmare, are actively encouraged with new tenants, often who've never lived in London before, invited to the get-togethers. A recent night out saw Goff, his three-strong team of employees and a raft of their tenants enjoying the charms of West End nightclub Mahiki, a favourite with Prince Harry. 

Does he not worry about the potential for damage? He tells FEMAIL: 'We take a security deposit from our members, in much the same way a letting agent would. 

'The reality is that our members are earning their own money and therefore understand the value of money and respect our property and importantly each other.

Chloe Smith has lived in Capital Living properties for two years and says they are good value

Chloe Smith, 25, works in publishing and has lived in Capital Living properties for two years.

Originally from Poole in Dorset, Chloe   says that she was cynical about the 'flat-fee rent' at first but was soon won over.

Currently sharing a flat with three others in Balham, she says she loves the fact that the company houses like-minded people together. 

'I spotted the ad on the website Spareroom.co.uk and thought it might be a scam at first...it sounded too good to be true. 

'Flat-hunting in London is a nightmare so I went for it and actually it's been brilliant. I actually think the rent is great value because lots of things are included that you'd probably pay extra for elsewhere.

'I've met some really good friends, a couple who will probably be friends for life and I even introduced my flatmate to a friend and they're now dating.

'Every house-share has annoying people but so far, bar one guy who left pretty quickly, I've liked everyone that I've lived with.' 

'In fact, this is a large reason why people choose to live in our community. Of course there is the occasional house party but there is little chance of things getting out of hand because everyone has work on Monday morning and if there is a bit of mess the house goes back to normal after a good clean from our cleaning team!' 

Goff says that a lonely experience when he first moved to the city following a university course in Birmingham prompted him to start the company with £16,000 in savings. 

Although the flat-fee service is around £300 more expensive than your average room rental in, say, Clapham, it's a room that comes with a built-in social life plus a weekly cleaner and boring domestic essentials such as dishwasher tablets. 

One such tenant who says the agency is a perfect fit is Robert Hart. Living in leafy Balham with three flatmates, the investment banker totally buys into the 'social living' idea and used the company to find not just a place to live but an instant social circle. 'I moved to London from Worcestershire,' he says '...and I wanted to broaden my social circle.'

He describes the experience so far as having a 'built-in social life'.

Although Goff's tenants are almost all at the beginning or mid-way through what promises to be a glittering career, he's less accepting of 'trust-funders'.

'Young people need to earn an honest crust,' he says, although he's not averse to fretful parents paying the rent while their offspring find their way in the big smoke.

Goff says they've had no real problems with unruly tenants to date with expectations at the interview process 'high'. 

He says: 'In six years we have never had to evict anyone, have we asked people to leave or not allowed them to renew? Sure, but not for anything to write home about. 

'Our members are professionals and have too much going for them to do anything that would risk their careers.'
