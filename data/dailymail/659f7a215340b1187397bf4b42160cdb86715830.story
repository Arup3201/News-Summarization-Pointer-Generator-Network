Singer Charlotte Church has attacked fellow pop stars Rihanna and Miley Cyrus for acting as ‘submissive sex objects’ in their videos.

The 27-year-old – dubbed the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she first shot to fame aged 11 – admitted she now regrets wearing revealing outfits as a teenage star.

And she called for BBC radio chiefs to put a ‘decency barrier’ on what they play on their stations and avoid promoting tracks that are accompanied by offensive online pop videos.

Miss Church was speaking a week after Miss Cyrus’ highly sexualised appearances were criticised by fellow artists Sinead O’Connor and Annie Lennox.

Giving the annual John Peel lecture at the Radio Academy Radio Festival in Manchester, the mother-of-two said she worried explicit music videos are aimed at increasingly younger viewers.

In a thinly veiled attack on Miss Cyrus – who first found fame as Hannah Montana on Disney – she said: ‘The women generally filling these roles are very young, often previous child stars or Disney tweens who are simply interested in getting along in an industry glamourised to be the most desirable career for young women. 

Pressure: Miss Church has revealed she was pressured into wearing revealing outfits by middle aged men

'You look great': The men would spin lines such as 'You've got a great body' and 'It'll look classy', said the star

‘They are encouraged to present themselves as hypersexualised, unrealistic, cartoonish, as objects. Reducing female sexuality to a prize that can be won.’

Miss Church reserved her most stinging attacks for Rihanna, whose recent YouTube video Pour It Up provoked outrage when she was seen writing on a chair in a jewel-encrusted bikini.

She said: ‘[It] may have over 40 million hits on YouTube but you only have to look at the online response to see it is only a matter of time before the public turn on an artist for pushing it too far.

'But the single, like all of Rihanna’s other provocative hits, will make her male writers and producers and record label guys a ton of money. There is no easier way to sell something than to get some chick to get her t*** out, right?’

But Miss Church admitted her own past was not blemish-free, and said she now regrets appearing in fishnet tights and a corset in the video to her single Call My Name as a 19-year-old.

She said: ‘When I was 19 or 20 I found myself in this position, being pressured into wearing more and more revealing outfits.

'And the lines I was spun again and again, generally by middle aged men, were "You look great, you’ve got a great body, why not show it off?" or "Don’t worry, it’ll look classy, it’ll look artistic".

'I felt deeply uncomfortable about the whole thing but I was often reminded by record executives just whose money was being spent. 

‘The consequence of this betrayal of me is that I am being constantly abused on social media, being called slut and a whore and a catalogue of other indignities. Now I find it difficult to promote my music in the places where it would be best suited, because of my history.’

Miss Church named a host of other female stars in her lecture, criticising Jennifer Lopez raunchy performance on Britain’s Got Talent earlier this year and blaming Madonna for ‘putting her sexuality at the heart of her image and her performance.’

She called for websites such as YouTube to exercise greater control over what music videos can be viewed by children, saying: ‘It is interesting to note that anyone of any age has been able to watch Christina Aguilera’s simulated masturbation in her “Dirrty” video on YouTube since the website began, and yet you must sign in to the site to prove your age if you wanted to watch Bjork’s stunning video for “Pagan Poetry”.’

The singer also called for radio programmers to take a musician’s pop videos into account when deciding to give them airtime.

She said: ‘BBC radio is notorious for misreading sexual metaphor and innuendo as innocent, most famously with Lou Reed’s Walk On The Wild Side, but more recently there doesn’t seem to be a decency barrier at all.

‘If there are no sanctions put on music that is written so zealously about genitalia or uses soft porn in its promotion online what is to stop artists from making their videos and live performances more sexy to drive up online views and subsequently more radio play.’

At the height of her fame, Miss Church sang for the Queen and Pope John Paul II and her 2005 pop album spawned four hits.

However, in recent years she has moved away from the pop world and seen her musical fortunes wane.

After taking a five-year break from writing, she released Back To Scratch in 2010. The album flop in the charts and sold just 16,000 copies in its first month.
