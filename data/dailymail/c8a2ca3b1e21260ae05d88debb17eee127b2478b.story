‘We started the World Cup in our shorts and that’s how we’re ending it.’

Adrian Chiles had a different take on how to present football on television and those words delivered in his opening to ITV’s coverage of last year’s World Cup final in Rio summed it up.

He and his beach-side ITV pundits, all shorts and smiles, navigated a minority of viewers through Germany v Argentina. The vast majority had chosen the BBC, their studio and sensible suits.

But at the end of the evening, when Chiles told us it had been an ‘absolute privilege’ to present a World Cup from Brazil, you knew he meant it. He is a genuine fan.

Don’t let Chiles’ taciturn style kid you — he is a very capable live TV presenter but he has looked an uncomfortable match for ITV’s portfolio of broadcast rights. Chiles is a non-conformist and he can’t ‘sell’ a big TV match as hard as others can. That’s an issue for a commercial channel.

The great Tony Hancock had a lovely phrase to accentuate his ‘me against the world’ standpoint and I half-expected Chiles to borrow it and open a programme with a morose look accompanied by: ‘Stone me, what a life!’

And, of course, when it came to those dreaded head-to-heads with the BBC, he had a World Cup Golden Boot winner in Gary Lineker to compete with on the other channel.

What Chiles did bring were refreshingly different questions, many that could have come straight off the terraces. It made for interesting responses. And throw him an unusual camera shot and he could conjure up a quirky line.

He was also thrown pitch-side presentation and Roy Keane’s moods — not easy to handle.

Sadly, he hadn’t done a deal with the weather gods. A downpour in Poland saw a World Cup qualifier postponed, giving Chiles two hours to fill. Then an electric storm in Miami last summer halted England’s friendly against Honduras and left Chiles and his colleagues sweltering. ‘I’m off to the dry cleaners!’ said a sweat-sodden Chiles as the match resumed.

Chiles is to be replaced by broadcast journalist Mark Pougatch. This is a big break for a polished radio performer who now has the chance to forge a more substantial TV career.
