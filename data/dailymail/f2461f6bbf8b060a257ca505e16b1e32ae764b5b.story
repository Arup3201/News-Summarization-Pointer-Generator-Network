Support for Ed Miliband is plummeting even among his party's supporters, an opinion poll reveals.

YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago.

The poll – for The Sunday Times – found that 42 per cent no longer think he could do the job at all, against 28 per cent last month.

The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader.

Labour are also now behind the Conservatives when Ed Miliband's name is mentioned to voters – but would move back into the lead under either former home secretary Alan Johnson or David Miliband, the poll revealed.

The two main parties both recorded 33 per cent support, with Ukip on 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 7 per cent. 

But when Ed Miliband's name was mentioned in association with Labour, the Tories took a two-point lead, on 33 per cent to 31.

Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock last night warned the party is committing ‘political suicide’ by questioning Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Lord Kinnock, putting on a bizarre Indian accent, quoted his newsagent as having said to him of the plotters: ‘What are all these crazy people doing to our party?’

He told BBC Radio that the threat to Mr Miliband’s leadership was ‘not substantial’ but was causing ‘a degree of damage’.

‘As far as I can see, their tendency is towards political suicide,’ he said.

‘There’s no real substance in what they are saying. And the claims that they’re making, so far as you can identify them, are totally unjustifiable. 

'Because after four years, Ed Miliband is a leader of proven courage, high intelligence, he’s got a great quality of leadership, of great leadership, which is being resilient, calm and defiant.’ 

Lord Kinnock admitted Mr Miliband was portrayed as ‘remote, cerebral, weird if you like’ but this was ‘in total contrast with the man he really is’.

Ex-leader Neil Kinnock warned ousting Mr Miliband would be 'suicide' but shadow cabinet minister Caroline Flint admitted some of her colleagues have 'jitters' about the leadership

If Mr Miliband's brother David returned to the Commons and became Labour leader, the YouGov poll suggested the party would have a six-point lead over the Tories.

But neither Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper nor her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, would do anything to improve Labour's prospects as leader, it found. 

Of all voters, only 7 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband has been a strong leader, with 59 per cent viewing him as weak.

A separate poll, by Survation for The Mail on Sunday, showed that if Mr Miliband were replaced by Mr Johnson or suave business spokesman Chuka Umunna, Labour's four-point lead over the Tories would double. 

That extra support could gain Labour an extra 50 seats, pollsters say.

When asked to choose between Mr Miliband, Mr Umunna, Miss Cooper, Mr Balls or Mr Johnson in 15 categories, Mr Miliband came last in eight of them. Mr Johnson won six categories and Mr Umunna five.

Today Mr Umunna leapt to his leader's defence, insisting general election victory in May was still possible.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'You get noises every now and then, but on the whole, these are anonymous and off-the-record.

'If you speak to the overwhelming majority of our MPs, of our supporters, people recognise this is going to be a tough for election but are absolutely up for it. I

'f we look at our progress, during this parliament, there's been a lot of talk about polls. Those go up and down, but under Ed's leadership we are now in touching distance of a general election victory.'

Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint insisted those calling for Mr Miliband to quit were 'a few' against the 'many' who want him to stay.

She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'These things happen, they are a few voices against the many in our party who are very focused on winning the election under his leadership.

'I think Ed is very focused on what we need to do to win. He focuses on what he has to do for the British people.'

Mr Miliband's critics in the Labour party were urged to put up or shut up yesterday in a high risk attempt to end the plotting against him.

Lucy Powell, the Labour leader's new general election enforcer, ordered plotters to 'show us your colours' or move on, as it emerged one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbench team is ready to call on him to go.

The Labour leadership has sought to play down the threat to Mr Miliband, publicly blaming the media for fuelling attacks on him in retaliation for his calls for press regulation.

But after a terrible party conference speech, in which he forgot the deficit, a series of botched photo opportunities and the erosion of Labour's poll lead over the Tories, behind the scenes there is a growing sense of dismay about the prospect of Mr Miliband leading the party to defeat.

Ms Powell, who Mr Miliband made vice-chairman of the general election campaign in the reshuffle earlier this week, issued a direct challenge to his opponents in the Labour ranks to end the anonymous briefings.  

She told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live: 'Well what I would say to those people is be careful what you wish for because if your analysis is right, that there are people that are concerned about Ed but yet don't want a leadership contest then what they are doing in briefing anonymously and, in my view, cowardly briefing newspapers, they are bringing about the worst of all worlds. They need to decide what their plan is and get on with it either way.'

She added: 'Either show us your colours and put names to quotes or let's just move on and have a different conversation.'
