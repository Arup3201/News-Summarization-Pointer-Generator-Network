Curtis Elton is a perfectly normal nine-year-old boy. He loves football. His favourite band is One Direction. And his favourite cartoon is Phineas And Ferb on the Disney Channel.

But he has an exceptional talent. When he sits down at the enormous white grand piano in the sitting room of his parents’ home, you realise Curtis is a little bit different.

For a brief moment, he is perfectly still, fingers hovering over the keys. Then, suddenly, he’s off like a rocket, launching into a Bach prelude and fugue in D minor.

Piano player Curtis Elton, nine, is releasing an album after becoming the youngest person in the world to pass a university-level piano diploma

Curtis' ATCL Diploma took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice. His mother Haley, pictured with him left, is also a pianist

There’s a look of intense concentration on his face. His fingers whizz up and down the keys as he switches into a Chopin etude in E major.

The entire piece of music – lasting around 10 minutes – is done from memory. There’s not a sheet of music in sight.

From the other side of the room, his mum Hayley, 40, looks on with pride.

Curtis - all 4ft 3in of him - is a musical prodigy, a mini Mozart, a budding Beethoven.

He plays to concert halls and has just become the youngest person in the world to be given an Associate of Trinity College London (ATCL) diploma.

The diploma – which took nearly two years of study and involved two hours of daily practice – is the equivalent of passing the first-year of a university music degree.Curtis had to play for more than half an hour in a church hall in St Albans, not far from their home in

Curtis began playing when he was just three

Whetstone, north London, in front of an examiner. The other two piano students sitting the exam that day were much older - 19 and 38.

‘I was nervous before I went in,’ he giggles now. ‘But when I sit down at the piano, I feel calm and relaxed. I think: “I’m just going to sit here for a few seconds and start.”’

He also had to write 700 words of ‘programme notes’ explaining his choice of pieces – the Bach he plays today, as well as a Mozart sonata in D major and a Schubert impromptu in G flat major. He says he did these himself at the computer in the upstairs study without help from his mum Hayley or his dad, Jonathan, 45, a graphic designer.

This remarkable achievement is the culmination of six years of hard work.

Curtis started playing at the age of three after begging Hayley, herself a professional concert pianist and piano teacher, for a go while she was playing.

‘I used to play him lullabies before bed,’ she says. ‘Because I was doing it, he wanted to. So I taught him his scales.’

The first song he learned in full was Yankee Doodle Went To Town – rapidly followed by the Pink Panther theme and then Beethoven’s Ode To Joy.

‘I realised he was talented almost immediately. He picked things up very quickly,’ says Hayley.

At the age of four, Curtis could read music by sight and took his Royal School of Music Grade One exam. 

‘When we turned up at the exam centre, they thought it was me taking the exam,’ laughs his mum.

‘He was so little that he had to helped up onto the piano stool.’

He passed and has since has whizzed through the grades. He passed the final one, Grade Eight, last year, becoming the youngest pianist ever to do so.

His first concert performance was three years ago, when a friend of his mum asked if he would play at a show to raise money for the homeless. He chose a piece by Schumann.

Now he gives several performances a year - playing three times at the Chopin museum in Mallorca and performing in front of an audience of more than 2,000 people at Birmingham’s International Convention Centre.

‘I was a teensy bit nervous,’ says Curtis. ‘But it was exciting.’

In 2011, piano manufacturers Yamaha invited him to the firm’s HQ in Milton Keynes headquarters and offered to sponsor Curtis, loaning him keyboards for performances.

Not that it has all been plain sailing.

Two years ago, Curtis was hugely disappointed when he entered ITV’s Britain’s Got Talent contest.

After receiving a standing ovation from the judges at the audition stage, he was told to prepare to return for the televised announcement of the semi-finalists two months later.

But two days before filming, he received a call saying that, in fact, he hadn’t made it through. No reason was given.

‘We were all set to go – we had a hotel booked in central London and everything,’ says Hayley.

‘Curtis had his suitcase packed – we were very disappointed.’

‘I was looking forward to playing for the Queen,’ adds Curtis, wistfully.

He was heartbroken. Perhaps, Simon Cowell’s low-brow musical tastes don’t stretch to Chopin and Schumann.

Bouncing back from that setback, Curtis had the challenge of juggling piano practice with his Year Five school work at the £16,000-a-year Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ School in Hertfordshire.

Though an average week involves six hours of piano practice, his mum says school work is his priority.

‘We only ever practice piano if he’s finished his homework, and though he receives a couple of invitations to perform each month, he can only do concerts on weekends or in the school holidays.’

Even once his homework’s done, piano isn’t the only after-school activity. Curtis is a keen ice skater and footballer. He and his eight-year-old sister Sophia – who plays the piano and the harp - take lessons at the local Lee Valley Ice Rink. Curtis also plays defence for the school football team.

Despite his musical talent, his mother says homework always comes first

And it all has to be fitted in before bed at 8pm.

It’s an awful lot for one little boy, but his mum insists she is no Tiger Mother.

‘It’s important he has other interests. I’d never dream of sending him to a stage school. He’s intelligent and needs a proper education and normal friends.’

She says that had he not been so eager to learn in the first place, she wouldn’t have forced him to take up piano.

‘I don’t want to push him but he loves performing. He loves music – I can’t imagine him not wanting to do it. ‘

Does she ever worry about the effect of so much success so young? There’s no shortage of cautionary tales about child prodigies collapsing under the weight of expectation.

‘I think within classical music there are child prodigies – such as the Chinese pianist Lang Lang – who go on to do well,’ says Hayley. ‘And Curtis has balance. He has a normal school life and normal friends.’

What if he were to lose interest and pack it all in?

‘I wouldn’t mind if he really didn’t want to do it. But he’s got a talent and to be able to play and make people happy is a rare thing. It makes him happy, so it would be a shame.’

Listening to Curtis reeling off his favourite composers - Bach and Schubert and Chopin and Mozart (‘because he’s fast and fun’) and pianists (‘Lang Lang and Elton John’) - it’s hard to disagree.

He’s bubbly and confident and bursting with energy, bustling around showing me YouTube videos of Elton John playing Circle of Life on Hayley’s iPad and talking excitedly about his football heroes, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie.

I can’t imagine him being forced into anything. He’s clearly mad about playing.

Happily, Curtis says he’s ‘definitely not’ tempted to quit piano – not even if he got the chance to join One Direction.

In November, he plans to release a CD and wants to take the next qualification – equivalent to a full three-year undergraduate degree.

He also wants to learn how to compose and conduct. When he leaves school, he wants to go to university to study politics and maths. And then what – can he see himself becoming a professional pianist?

‘Well, if my piano gets very good, I’d like to be a piano player with an orchestra,’ he says, thoughtfully. ‘But I’d like to be Prime Minister as well - and maybe a doctor.’

Blimey. A concert-giving, piano-playing, doctor Prime Minister? David Cameron had better watch out.
