Police are hunting a teenage girl who slapped a supermarket worker across the face with a large wet bream in what may have been a childish dare.

The 52-year-old woman was working on an Asda fish counter in Accrington town centre, Lancashire, when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale.

Without warning the girl picked up a bream which was on ice and used it to assault the shocked worker before running out of the store.

Assault and vinegar: Police want to speak to these two people, seen in CCTV images, after a 52-year-old Asda fish counter employee was slapped in the face with a large wet bream in Accrington, Lancashire

Battering: Police are classing the incident at this branch of Asda in Accrington, Lancashire, as an assault

It is believed a teenage boy was filming the incident on his phone and also fled the shop when he was challenged.

Police described the prank as 'completely unacceptable' and have issued CCTV images of two suspects.

The incident happened at about 3pm on Tuesday, February 4 and officers have asked for anyone who knows those in the images to come forward.

The girl is described as having an Irish accent 
and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde, shoulder-length untidy hair.

She
 was wearing dark jeans and a blue coat with white cuffs, white on the
 front and a red collar with â€˜I love PBâ€™ on the left breast pocket.

The man is described as being around the same age, 5ft 8in and wearing a dark coat and dark grey trousers and boots.

PC Graham Hartley said: 'This behaviour is completely unacceptable and I would appeal to anybody that witnessed this incident or recognises either the man or the woman pictured in the CCTV images to come forward and contact me, PC 1183 Hartley on 101.'

The incident is an odd echo of sketches by Monty Python's Flying Circus - one of which featured a man in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another man with a fish.

His fun is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head, knocking him into the water.

No laughing matter: The incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by Monty Python

The incident also has more serious echoes of 'happy slapping', a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras.

Mostly performed by teenagers, the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet.

Some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15-year-old girl, who was too young to be named, was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29-year-old victim Gavin Waterhouse, who later died.
