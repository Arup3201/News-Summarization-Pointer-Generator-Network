The father of James Bulger today revealed how the boy’s murder ‘ripped’ him apart from his wife.

Ralph Bulger, 46, said he split from his wife Denise Fergus, 45, because they had so much grief that they could not comfort each other after their two-year-old son was killed 20 years ago today in Liverpool.

Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, who were just 10 years old at the time, abducted James from the Bootle Strand shopping centre before carrying out the murder which shocked the nation.

‘We've got a big family,’ Mr Bulger told BBC Radio 4. ‘We just saw to each other. I don't think it's a pain you can heal. It's been with me for life. She (Denise) was devastated. It just ripped us apart.’

‘You just try your best. We had the best thing taken away from us. It always comes back. You still feel the same, but you learn to live with the pain. I just feel like I should have had him at the time.

‘I thought it would be alright - it was just kids who took him. It felt like I was in a dream. I couldn't believe it. They didn't just kill James. They tortured him. They mutilated him.’

He added: ‘I was just killing myself. Sometimes I was drinking a bottle of whisky and couldn't get drunk. Two bottles of whisky. I tried to kill the pain. It didn't work for me. For years and years.’

Venables and Thompson were jailed for life but released on licence with new identities in 2001.

Ralph Bulger

Venables, 30, had his parole revoked in 2010 and was jailed for two years after admitting downloading and distributing indecent images of children. Now he has made a fresh application for release and the hearing is expected soon.

But Mr Bulger told BBC Radio 4: ‘For them to be like that at such a young age - they're older now, imagine what they could do now. What's going to stop them trying to take one of our kids again?

‘I know exactly what happened to James. The public doesn't. I think people should know what they're capable of. They were treated good. The powers that be had the last say. I've got no say.’

Mr Bulger, who is releasing a book called
My James, said last week that in his darkest moments, he blamed Denise 
for letting their son out of her sight - a reaction which now makes him 
feel ashamed.

'Stop protecting people like this and start protecting people like us, because we're the ones that need protecting. They're getting everything they can anyway'

Denise Fergus

Mrs
Fergus said she hopes to personally address the Venables parole 
hearing, adding: ‘My message to them (the parole panel) is don't release
him, I think Venables is still a danger to the public.’

She
believes there are indications of Venables being an ‘undiagnosed 
psychopath’ who should be in a hospital unit and added that she has ‘very serious concerns’ about the parole board’s approach.

Mrs
Fergus wed electrician Stuart in 1998 after the end of her marriage to 
James's father, Ralph. Now she aims to mark the anniversary by going 
with her family to place flowers on the boy’s grave.

She told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I'd never let James down. If I stop fighting I'd be letting him down. I don't want to go back because they were the darkest days of my life. I'm trying to move forward now.'

'You just try your best. We had the best thing taken away from us. It always comes back. You still feel the same, but you learn to live with the pain'

Ralph Bulger

Mrs Fergus also called for more protection of victims rather than criminals, saying: 'Stop protecting people like this and start protecting people like us, because we're the ones that need protecting.

'They're getting everything they can anyway. Everything they can be given, everything they can ask for they've been given. Why is it always so one-sided? Why is it all for them and never the victim?’

The Rt Rev James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool, said of today's memorial: ‘The whole community join the family and friends of James to remember his tragically short life and to share in their grief.’
