Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino reminds me of Brian Clough. The kind of guy who says what he likes, and likes what he says.

Don Revie didn’t like Clough, and I’m not convinced the greatest manager in Leeds’ history would have appreciated Cellino.

Yet most Leeds fans seem to adore the Italian.

Absurd as it sounds, having a beer with fans in The Old Peacock close to the stadium, and sitting in the away end at Brentford on Saturday, has led to a situation where the Leeds fans will worship the ground Cellino walks on, and accept some of the bizarre decisions he has made in the short time he has been in charge.

Cellino might turn out to be the best owner Leeds have ever had – I hope so because the city needs a thriving, healthy club to serve its huge fanbase. I lived and worked in Leeds when they last won the title in the top flight – I’m aware what the club means and how important it is in the city.

On the face of it, it’s shocking that Leeds fans are so welcoming of this guy: he only turned his attention to Leeds after failing to buy West Ham. This doesn’t mean he has bad intentions, but the any club will do' approach naturally invites scepticism.

Cellino asked for a huge fee from Fulham for Ross McCormack, and he got it. Fair play to him for that. So why tell the press the player refused to train, when on that day McCormack claims he was having his medical in London? No need for that from the owner, unless he’s desperate to win favour with fans. I’ve heard Leeds supporters declare openly that Cellino’s version is what 'REALLY' happened, dismissing McCormack’s version for no real reason other than he’s no longer connected to Leeds. How can they be so sure?

Brian McDermott was sacked and then reinstated and then sacked again. David Hockaday was hired from non-league - Cellino admitted he told Hockaday to 'shut the f***k up' and didn’t want his opinion. As most had predicted, Hocakday didn’t last long. If you include caretaker Neil Redfearn, there have been four managers at Leeds since Cellino took over in April. When asked why he has hired the new one, Darko Milanic, Cellino replied: 'He’s good-looking.'

Throw in an ongoing troublesome yacht taxation issue back in Italy, which the Football League describes as a 'cloud hanging over Cellino' and which could still give the League cause to re-assess his qualification as a fit and proper person to own a club in this country, and it all makes you wonder why the Leeds fans have fallen for this guy.

Surely a beer with the fans in the pub and a seat in the away end at Brentford weren’t enough to seduce supporters?

Spending money on players might have persuaded a few. But don’t they remember Peter Ridsdale? He spent huge amounts of money on players, and the financial collapse as a consequence was painful.

The truth is this: Massimo Cellino is benefiting from Leeds’ recent history. Ken Bates’ regime created a massive rift between the fans and the club. Then GFH made a mess of things, leaving the fans disillusioned and desperate.

So desperate that they have seemingly taken this sacking-machine Italian with a potentially nuclear tax bomb waiting to explode, into their hearts.

I know only too well that if you say anything remotely negative about Leeds United, their fans will hammer you. So in the week he took control of the club, Cellino gave an interview and said the words that he knew would capture the love and dedication of so many long-suffering fans. He had them when he said: 'The fans of Leeds are tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths.'

Those fans fell for Cellino right then. I hope he doesn’t break their hearts.
