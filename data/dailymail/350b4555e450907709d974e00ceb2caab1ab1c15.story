Designer rental is big business - and it's all thanks to Instagram.

Social media is fuelling the rise in multiple dress hire firms opening in the UK and America; even couture hire for children, BorrowMiniCouture.

Bosses say women feel like they can't wear the same thing twice if their friends have seen it online, and that every girl deserved that 'Cinderella experience'.

The novelty of renting a designer dress 
for a special occasion is now a weekly activity for many struggling to stay stylish online.

The fairytale illusion and one-upmanship the internet promotes means fashionistas are feeling like they need to show off a new designer outfit for every big night out or day 
at the races.

But many can't afford the price tag.

So companies such as Girl Meets Dress in the UK and
 Rent The Runway in the US are offering a solution, by letting you 
rent out a top end dress for the price of a cab ride instead.

Anna Bance,
 co-founder of Girl Meets Dress, says Instagram can be blamed for the 
rising demand - whether it is for a teenager at a school prom or 
thirty-something at a summer wedding.

'We
 provide millions of women with the ability to rent designer dresses and
 accessories for a fraction of the retail price,' she tells the 
Observer.

'Our
 customers are all over the UK, in towns, and in the countryside where 
they don't have access to the shops.

'It's exactly like Asos: you shop on
 our website and the dresses get delivered in a box to your door.'

Bance got the idea for the company while working as a PR 
manager for French luxury brand Hermès, where she would lend
dresses and accessories to magazines and celebrities - and she says everybody deserves a 'Cinderella experience'.

Established
 dress rental company Rent The Runway, meanwhile, boasts more than 
65,000 dresses ready to hire and provides a seamless dry 
cleaning service available to women all over the US.

The
 number of dresses it has rented out has doubled in each of the last two
 years, putting it on course for sales of £61.3m ($100m) this 
year.

'We're 
giving our customer access to things she wouldn't have otherwise 
purchased, either because it wasn't smart to buy it or she couldn't 
afford it,' Rent The Runway's co-founder Jennifer Hyman told Forbes 
magazine.

The ability to recycle favourite dresses is being curtailed by sites 
such as Facebook and Instagram, which is fuelling the rental boom. 'It 
creates pressure for women,' says Hyman.

'Now
 you can't repeat outfits because your friends have seen that outfit on 
social media. As ridiculous as that sounds, that is what drives our 
business.'
