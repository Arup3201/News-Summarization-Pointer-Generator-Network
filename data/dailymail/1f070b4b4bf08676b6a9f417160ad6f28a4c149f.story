A man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his ex-girlfriend because he was upset that she broke up with him. 

Murderer: Andrew Kugler from Maryland flew into a rage and murdered his girlfriend Amber Schinault

Andrew Kugler, 39, from Maryland flew into a rage and murdered his ex-girlfriend Amber Schinault, 36, by cutting her throat during a violent dispute in June 2012.  

Police found her body in the basement of her house in Berwyn Heights, Maryland, a month later.

Officers discovered her lifeless body with 'lacerations to her neck' while they were performing a welfare check at her home on 57th Avenue at about 3:30pm.

Prince George’s County police Sergeant Sonya Rorls told NBC 4: 'Once they got here, they had to force entry in to the home.

'They discovered the victim in the basement suffering from lacerations to her neck.' 

Less than a day after Schinault's body was found, police arrested Kugler.

They located him in the College Park Metro Station with his wrists  slit. 

He was taken to hospital where he was treated and then taken to jail.

In May 2014, he was found guilty of her murder after police discovered that he had crawled through a basement window and killed her.

Kugler was described as being Schinault’s ex-boyfriend and evidence at trial showed that he had become depressed after they broke up. 

However, they had a long history of domestic violence during their relationship.

In June 2012, Kugler was arrested for allegedly assaulting Schinault in a dispute in which she jumped on his car and severed her finger when it became caught in the wiper blades. 

She obtained a protective order.

After the judge sentenced Kugler to life with 10 years, Prince George's County State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks criticized him for his violent act.

She said: ‘The breakup of a relationship can be a difficult thing but there is absolutely no excuse for Mr. Kugler's violent response.’

Her family have also paid tribute to her memory  on a website and set up a petition on 'Care2 petitions' which hopes to 'protect her and other victims.' 

They described her as 'Our beautiful 36-year-old daughter Amber Schinault...the most loving and kind individual.'
