Two Michigan police officers have been applauded for their kindness after buying a child car seat for a hard-up couple rather than issuing them a ticket.

Officers Jason Pavlige, 32, and James Hodges, 26, of Fruitport Township, Michigan responded to a call made by a McDonald's worker who was concerned that a baby was not properly secured in a car seat when her parents picked up some food from the restaurant.

When the officers stopped the couple's car, they found the 10-month-old girl sitting in her mother's lap while her father drove the vehicle.

The couple, who have not been identified, explained that they did not have the means to buy a seat.

'They had just recently moved to the area,' Hodges told ABC News. 'We tried to have them contact family but they don't have anyone close. There were no co-workers, no one who could help them out.'

Rather than giving the couple a ticket, the officers decided on a different tact.

'We spoke with each other and made the decision to go get them a car seat so we'd know the kid was safe and that this issue wouldn't come up again,' Hodges said.

The two men pooled their money and, while Pavlige stayed with the family, Hodges went to a local Walmart to buy a new car seat for the baby.

They installed the seat and showed the shocked couple how to use it.

Quick-thinking: After learning the family could not afford a car seat for their child, the two officers pooled their money and went to this Walmart to buy a new seat before installing it for the shocked couple

'They didn't say much but were just very appreciative,' Hodges said.

The two officers didn't tell anyone about their good deed, which they carried out in February, but it came to light after a Walmart employee called the police station to let their superiors know.

But the men said they were simply doing their jobs. 

'We made the decision that was what we needed to do to solve the issue,' Hodges said. 'It's just part of what police officers do on a daily basis.'

In a letter to the officers, Public Safety Director Ken Doctor thanked the men for their actions, Mlive reported.

'This certainly goes above and beyond what is expected of you in serving our community,' his letter read. 'It reflects the care and compassion of the officers serving Fruitport Township.

Not the first time: In 2009, Pavlige (left) was given a 'life saving award' for saving a golfer who had a heart attack. He is pictured with resident David Wingate Sr., who helped him, and Police Chief Paul Smutz

'Sincere thanks for representing our department so well and providing, great service to the community. Keep up the good work.'

It is not the first time Pavlige has been recognized for his good work.

In 2009, he was awarded a 'life saving award' alongisde another officer after they successfully administered CPR on a man who had a heart attack on a gold course, Mlive reported.

Pavlige was also honored in 2007 for reviving a man who collapsed at The Lakes Mall.
