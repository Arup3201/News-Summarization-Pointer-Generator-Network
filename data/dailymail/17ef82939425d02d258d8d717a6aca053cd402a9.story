Wales prop Rhodri Jones could miss this season's RBS 6 Nations Championship due to injury.

Jones' regional team the Scarlets have confirmed that he suffered a dislocated shoulder during last Saturday's Guinness PRO12 victory over the Ospreys.

The 23-year-old, who has won 13 caps, provided bench cover throughout the recent autumn Test series for his Scarlets colleague Samson Lee.

He has become an important member of Wales head coach Warren Gatland's plans, and recently signed a national dual contract.

If Jones is confirmed as facing a lengthy lay-off - he will see a specialist on Tuesday - it could open the door for 33-year-old Adam Jones gaining a Wales squad recall after he was overlooked in November.

Rhodri Jones' Scarlets front-row colleague Kirby Myhill, meanwhile, suffered a suspected pectoral muscle tear during the Ospreys game.

'Scarlets can confirm that tighthead prop Rhodri Jones sustained a dislocated right shoulder, which was relocated while on the field, and was sent for preliminary imaging on Saturday evening,' the Scarlets said in a statement.

'Hooker Myhil has a suspected pec tear and has undergone initial imaging on his right shoulder.

'Both Jones and Myhill will meet with consultant specialists today to discuss the prognosis and to put a rehabilitation plan in place.'
