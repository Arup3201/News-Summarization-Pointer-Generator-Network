Emily Maynard was spotted sharing a lingering kiss with her fiancé Jef Holm yesterday - as the couple braved the latest media storm to hit their relationship.

The pictures - of them looking united and in love while grocery shopping - come amid claims the Bachelorette star was caught sending explicit photographs to another man.

The drama is said to have gone down on a recent vacation, which saw 26-year-old mother-of-one Maynard join Jef and his family in South Carolina.

Holm, 28, is said to have discovered 
saucy texts to and from another man on Emily's phone on August 19 - 
before 'exploding', Us Weekly reports.

It apparently resulted in a furious 
row, with Holm accusing Emily of cheating on him.

Emily - mother to seven-year-old daughter Ricki from her 
relationship to late boyfriend Ricky Hendrick - is then said to have the fled in tears after Jef told Emily to pack her bags.

But just days later, the pair put on a united front in public.

Brave face: The pair were out again today, holding hands on their way to Starbucks

Yesterday they were seen grocery 
shopping and kissing in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they were out 
again today, hand-in-hand, for a trip to Starbucks.

However Maynard has now hit back - saying the claims are unfounded.

She told People.com: 'It's one hundred percent not true.'

Holm added: 'It's funny to me. We were in a gated community in a private home with just my brothers and sisters. It's just bogus a 'source' would [say] we were fighting. None of that is true.'

Emily - who has been engaged to Holm for three months - has hit the headlines before over cheating claims.

She is said to have hooked up with 
runner-up Bachelorette suitor Arie Luyendyk just days before Jef's 
bended-knee proposal, filmed in May and aired on ABC in July.

Maynard rose to fame after getting engaged - and then splitting with - Bachelor star Brad Womack.
