Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has spoken of his sadness following the death of his brother Ibrahim and suggested that his club did not offer him sufficient support during a period which he describes as 'the hardest in my life.'

The Ivory Coast midfielder's 28-year-old brother tragically died of cancer last week, while Yaya was in Brazil representing his country at the World Cup and the City talisman has stated that he felt disappointed that he wasn't afforded greater sensitivity by his club employers.

The full squad were required for a post-season trip to Abu Dhabi, where City played a friendly game and met the club's owners.

International duty: Toure's brother Ibrahim died in Manchester while Yaya was playing at the World Cup in Brazil

Tragedy: The Ivorian FA informed confirmed that 
Ibrahim Toure, pictured here playing in Beirut in October, died in 
Manchester where he was being treated for cancer. He was aged 28.

Toure told France Football: 
'At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with 
my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, 
except that City did not want to grant me a few days.

'I went to celebrate the title championship in Abu Dhabi while my 
brother was lying in his sickbed. By fortune, Kolo was at his bedside. 
After that I blame myself for not insisting and for not making them 
respect me.

'However, 
club officials knew very well that I was suffering for a few months as 
the health of my brother declined. This is the reason I had several 
injuries at the end of the season, because my head had taken control of 
my body. These last four months have probably been the hardest in my 
life.'

Manchester City
 have been left disheartened by Toure's quotes and Sportsmail 
understands that Toure did not request compassionate leave to spend time
 with his brother.

City
 are widely acknowledged to have always adopted a caring and sensitive 
approach to personal issues affecting their players and they have an 
impeccable track record when it comes to offering welfare to their 
players, with Pablo Zabaleta, Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor all 
receiving sensitive support from the club and time off following 
upheaval in their personal lives in recent years.

A senior insider maintained that had Toure asked for those few days off, they would have been granted without hesitation.

Sportsmail also understands that City have been pro-active 
behind the scenes in supporting the midfielder, both during Ibrahim's 
battle with cancer and since his death last week.

City are believed to have pledged their unequivocal support to the 
family in the past week, with the club maintaining dialogue with former 
player Kolo Toure and brother Yaya, contributing to the arrangements for
 the funeral and even assisting with the paperwork. Before Ibrahim died, he was also invited to the club's Carrington training ground as a special guest.

A well-placed source stated: 'It is what we do for our players. They will always have our support.'

It
 should be noted that City, although a little bemused, do not view this 
latest development in their relationship with Toure as a major sticking 
point.

It is understood 
that there has been no conflict since the bizarre episode that saw Toure
 throw his future at the club into doubt when his agent Dimitri Seluk 
claimed that the club should have made more of a fuss for his 31st 
birthday, with his representative said that the midfielder was left 
'very upset'.

City did
 give Toure a birthday cake and wished him happy birthday on Twitter but
 the player's agent suggested he was ignored by the club's Abu Dhabi 
owners when the squad visited at then end of the season.

'None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It's really sick,' Seluk
 added.   Toure later backed his agent, writing on Twitter: 'Everything 
Dimitri said is true. He speaks for me. I will explain after the World 
Cup.'
