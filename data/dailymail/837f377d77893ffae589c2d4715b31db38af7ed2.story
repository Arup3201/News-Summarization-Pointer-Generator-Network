A paramedic who abandoned patients in an ambulance while he went shopping and had a hair cut has been found guilty of misconduct at a health tribunal.

Dominic Colella, who has resigned from the London Ambulance Service, twice 'held his colleagues to ransom' by forcing them to wait until his return before they could be driven to hospital.

The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) sitting at a hearing in Kennington, south London, today ruled he was guilty of misconduct relating to two incidents in March 2013 and he was struck off the medical register.

Dominic Colella, who was not present at the hearing, was found guilty of two counts of misconduct while working with the London Ambulance Service

In the first incident, an 85-year-old man who collapsed in the queue in a Marks and Spencer store from severe blood poisoning was forced to wait for 20 minutes in the back of an ambulance.

Colella, who failed to turn up at the hearing, had returned to the store and came back with two full bags of shopping before driving him to hospital on March 9, 2013.

The tribunal heard Colella's colleague, who was left to care for the elderly man alone, was questioned by the patient's 'anxious' wife about why her husband had not been taken to hospital.

Yvonne Purves said: 'After a little bit of time I wondered where [Colella] had gone.

'The wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we weren't leaving to go to hospital.

'He then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said 'do you want to go to hospital then?'.

'Obviously, I wanted to go to hospital some time ago. I waited 20 minutes for Colella while alone in the ambulance.' 

The panel heard how Colella left a patient in an ambulance with a colleague for 20 minutes while he did some shopping in a Marks and Spencer (file picture)

Just two weeks later, while responding to another potentially life-threatening 999 call, he delayed a 40-year-old patient with a head injury from being taken to hospital and left him in the care of a more junior practitioner so he could have his hair cut.

Colella admitted abandoning his colleagues and patients, but the panel said his failure to turn up to the hearing meant they could not know if he appreciated the seriousness of his actions, meaning there was a 'risk of repetition'.

Paramedic Donna Blair, who had arrived at the scene first, said she was handing over care of the patient to Colella's colleague when she noticed a nearby shopper looking 'gobsmacked'.

She told the panel: 'I looked to my left and saw Dominic sitting at the hairdresser's chair with a lady putting a cape around his neck.'

She told the hearing she had thought he was 'just having a joke' when he earlier asked her whether she fancied a haircut, and added that he could do with a trim himself.

The panel heard that he delayed the ambulance leaving for hospital by between five and ten minutes.  

Chairman of the panel, Gillian Fleming, said members of the public would be 'shocked' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his 'fitness to practise was impaired'.

Ms Fleming added that they do not know if Colella, who joined the London Ambulance Service in 1996, has since continued to work as a paramedic.

Ms Fleming said today: 'Whilst it appears no harm was caused, the potential impact of the registrant's actions could have had serious consequences for the patients.

'The registrant's actions may indicate an attitudinal problem which he appears to have taken no real steps to address.

'There's no evidence to suggest his behaviour has changed.' 

Ms Fleming said Colella would be struck off the HCPC register with immediate effect, adding: 'The registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse.

'The panel considers that a striking off order is the only appropriate and proportionate order in this case.'
