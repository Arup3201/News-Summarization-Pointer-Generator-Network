High street retailers were today braced for their most frantic day in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers make a last  dash for gifts - with this lunchtime said to be the busiest hour.

Visa Europe expected some £1.3billion to be spent using its cards today, making it the busiest day on the UK high street in the run-up to Christmas.

Some £916,667 was predicted to be spent every minute, or £15,278 every second, on Visa cards, according to the company. The peak time was in the lunch hour break from 1pm to 2pm.

Meanwhile, it has been forecast that Boxing Day sales at some retailers including Next and Currys PC World will start on Christmas Eve.

Bosses at the Manchester Arndale shopping centre said they expected about 220,000 visitors today on the back of a similar number coming through its doors yesterday, and customers were spending more money this Christmas.

Centre director David Allinson said: ‘The feedback we are getting from the retailers is that people are spending more this Christmas. The average transaction value is up.

‘Technology is always a key seller with the Playstation 4 one of the best sellers, and jewellery has again sold strongly. Now the winter weather is a bit cooler we have seen a big increase in people buying coats and capes.

‘On a lighter note the success of the Frozen film has been unbelievable with more than 5,000 Elsa and Anna dolls sold at the Disney Store.’

He continued: ‘Today is extremely busy. Yesterday we had 220,000 people visit us and we are expecting at least the same today if not better. It has been a busy week. We had 400,000 people come through this weekend.

‘Today is the day we see lots of men with anguished faces, with some taking advantage of our gift-wrapping service in which we ask for donations to our chosen charities.

‘In general terms the numbers overall have been comparable to last year. We had a very successful December last year as over five and a half million came through the doors and we are hitting those numbers again.’

Happy experience for some: Shoppers hit Oxford Street for last-minute presents before Christmas Day

Steven Madeley, director of the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff, said an estimated 200,000 people had passed through the doors today, looking for a last minute bargain.

'After a record-breaking week, we had another very busy day at St David's and lots of shoppers taking advantage of early retailer sales to snap up a bargain,' he said.

'Local schools have also finished for Christmas and we saw lots of families at St David's today.'

The New West End Company, which represents shops in London's Oxford, Bond and Regent Streets said it had been a bumper Christmas for the area's retailers.

'In the five day countdown to Christmas we projected £300 million would go through the tills across the West End, and with just one day to go we're hearing confidence from retailers that we're going to exceed this mark,' a spokesman said.

'The West End welcome for shoppers has never been better,with great promotions on offer, and our welcome ambassadors were on hand during the "golden hour" rush today to help shoppers make their last minute shopping dash go without a hitch.' 

The new retail ombudsman, who takes up his role on January 2, urged shoppers to be ‘savvy’ to avoid issues such as faulty goods, unwanted presents and delivery issues.

The ombudsman, consumer barrister Dean Dunham, said: ‘Before you complete your purchase ask the retailer what their returns policy is with Christmas presents, always ask for a gift receipt and if you are ordering online ask the retailer to confirm in writing when the goods will arrive.’

Kevin Jenkins, managing director at Visa Europe, said: ‘Black Friday kick-started Christmas on the high street and online this year but the busiest bricks and mortar day will likely remain in its traditional slot close to Christmas.

‘Retailers’ multi-channel approach should cause a surge in footfall from click-and-collect sales too, with the opportunity for further shopping in-store when consumers arrive.'

He added: 'We're seeing huge numbers of purchases on the high street as people make their last minute dash for gifts, key grocery items and other supplies with Christmas Day approaching,' he said.

'Today we are processing the highest volume of transactions per second we've ever seen on Visa debit and credit cards in the UK, peaking at around 1.30pm, and we fully expect to hit our prediction of £1.3 billion spent on the day.'

‘We are likely to see £1.3billion spent in total today. Lunch hour should prove the most popular time for a shopping trip, either for last-minute gifts or final ingredients for Christmas dinner.’ 

Some 34million transactions are expected to take place which is 7 per cent higher than in 2013, while spending is predicted to rise 6 per cent. 

Superdrug buying director Simon Comins said: ‘It’s an old cliche that still rings true, many men are utterly disorganised when it comes to gift buying. We see more men in our stores in the run up to Christmas than any other time of the year.

‘What we like to call “last minute men” often leave their shopping to the very last minute. On Christmas Eve alone we expect to sell 200,000 bottles of perfume and fragrance gifts.’

This weekend saw over 800,000 people visit Westfield centres in London and shopping hours have been extended until midnight tonight to allow more last-minute shoppers the chance to purchase presents.

Retail analysts Springboard say today should be the busiest shopping day of the year, but they expect an overall drop in footfall year-on-year on Christmas Eve.

Meanwhile, experts have forecast traditional Boxing Day sales could become extinct after a rise in pre-Christmas discounts, with Next and Currys PC World sales expected to start on Christmas Eve.

Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, PricewaterhouseCoopers said.

Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches.

John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas.

The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so. 

Amazon is expecting Christmas Day to be its busiest day ever for sales of digital books, music, television, films and video games – and said its Boxing Day sales will start at 4pm on December 25.

More than 1,600 offers will be available, with an average of 35 per cent off current Amazon UK prices. Offers will include £37 off a £170 Sony smart-watch and £15 off a £40 Philips blender.

Meanwhile, Mark Kelly, marketing manager at online retailer Appliances Direct, said: ‘TVs are a popular Boxing Day buy due to the strong deals available.

‘We also think health and fitness products such as juicers, fitness bands, smart weighing scales and food dehydrators will fly of the shelves ahead of people kick-starting their New Year diets.’
