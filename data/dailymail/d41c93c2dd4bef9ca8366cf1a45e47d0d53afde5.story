Extreme gene manipulation has been used to modify bacteria that die if they get out of human control.

Instead of using traditional genetic engineering - which moves a gene from one organism to another - scientists have rewritten the language of genetics.

The breakthrough is a potential step toward better management of genetically engineered organisms, including crops.

Extreme gene manipulation tools have been used to modify bacteria that die if they get out of human control

Genetically altered microbes are used now in industry to produce fuels, medicines and other chemicals. 

The new technique might also reduce the risk of using them outdoors, such as for cleaning up toxic spills.

Scientists from Harvard and Yale introduced the new approach in two papers released this week by the journal Nature. 

They modified the DNA of the bacterium e. coli so that it can't survive without particular amino acids - the building blocks of proteins.

Those amino acids are not found in nature, only in the lab. So if such a modified organism gets away from where humans supply the stuff, it will die.

Both teams built on a technique reported in October 2013, when scientists successfully recoded the genome by making  widespread changes to the DNA of bacteria.

That left the organisms’ ability to work intact but made them more resistant to viruses.

In the study, they began with such a recoded bacteria and decided to give it a weakness.

They made it dependent on a synthetic amino acid, not found in nature, that would have to be provided by researchers.

If scientists stop supplying a particular unnatural amino acid synthesised in the laboratory, the bacteria died. 

The group grew a total of 1 trillion E. coli cells from various experiments, and after two weeks none had escaped. 

During a press conference, Ferren Isaacs of Yale and George Church of Harvard said they believed it would be possible, although challenging, to extend their technique to genetically modified crops.

That could ease concerns about their spreading outside their designated fields.

And experts not connected with the work said they were impressed.

The papers 'point the way towards putting (genetically modified organisms) on a very tight leash, one that is meant to be unbreakable,' Richard Lenski of Michigan State University, said in an email.

Karmella Haynes, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and synthetic biology at Arizona State University, called the bacteria work 'a significant advance.' 

She said it would be difficult to make it work with the more complex genetic machinery of crop plants.

Rina Singh, senior director for policy of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation, said the work is 'extremely useful...This is some really good stuff.' 

While scientists have previously used 'suicide genes' to control microbes, the new approach might be easier, she said.
