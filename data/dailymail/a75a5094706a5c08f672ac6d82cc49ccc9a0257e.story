A devout Muslim held his ex-wife prisoner on the toilet for an hour and physically assaulted her as punishment for wearing Western clothes.

Khalique Miah has been jailed for 18 months for the attack on Zahanara Begum.

She was on the loo when her former husband  burst in dressed in black, wielding a hammer and referring to her underwear as 'Satan'.

Miah, 35, covered her mouth with a gloved hand to stop her screaming, punched her in the chest and stomach then climbed on top of her, holding her in place, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

He started haranguing her about her plucked eyebrows, shaved legs and highlighted hair, telling her she should not wear Western clothes and calling her knickers 'Satan'.

The couple’s three-year-old daughter woke up and started crying, but Miah refused to let Mrs Begum go and comfort her.

After an hour she begged for her freedom and he relented, telling her to get in the bath.

He then took her into the living room, where the father-of-two said her hair would have to go.

She agreed, not realising what he meant until he went into the kitchen, fetched a pair of scissors and started snipping it off into a carrier bag.

By this point it was nearly 3am, but Mrs Begum decided to wake the couple’s children in the hope their presence would stop Miah hurting her.

The defendant pocketed his ex-wife’s mobile phone, cut her landline and refused to let her leave the flat until 10am the next day, when she persuaded him she wanted to give the marriage another go.

He agreed to phone her family and when they arrived at the address in Whitechapel, East London, Mrs Begum asked them to call the police.

Miah admitted false imprisonment and assault causing actual bodily harm.

Passing sentence, Judge Simon Wilkinson said the victim had been through a 'terrifying ordeal' at the hands of her former husband.

He said: 'At 11pm, you arrived at her address unannounced and uninvited. You were dressed in black and carrying a hammer in the waistband of your trousers.

'You surprised her when she was sitting on the WC in her bathroom. She could not have been more vulnerable.

'You put your gloved hand over her mouth to stifle her screams then punched her and slapped her to the chest area.

'When you finally allowed her off the toilet seat you cut off her hair with a pair of scissors. You also cut her landline and took her mobile phone. Such conduct cannot and will not be tolerated.'

Miah, who works at Tesco in Bow, East London, has no previous convictions and had been on the supermarket’s fast-track management programme.

He was married to Mrs Begum for eight years and they had two children, now aged three and seven.

Mathew Dance, defending, said: 'He has indicated genuine remorse. He says he has learned his lesson.

'He wants to put all this behind him and get on with his life.'

Miah, of Whitechapel, pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and assault causing actual bodily harm.
