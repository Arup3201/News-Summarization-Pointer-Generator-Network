Relations between Downing Street and the Home Office were under growing strain last night as David Cameron responded to speculation about Theresa May’s leadership ambitions by suggesting he ignored such ‘rubbish’.

The Prime Minister used a TV broadcast to say that he was not concerned about being a ‘popular guy’, adding: ‘It’s so vital that you look to the horizon and not tomorrow’s headlines, because there is a sort of daily battle of this story and that event.

‘It’s all rubbish. What matters is: Are you taking the right long-term decisions for the good of the country?’

Death stare: Cameron has dismissed the idea that Theresa May is positioning herself as his successor

His remarks were widely seen as reference to two weeks of stories claiming Mrs May is positioning herself to succeed him.

For the second week running at Prime 
Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Ed Miliband attempted to taunt Mr 
Cameron over the swirling rumours– saying the Prime Minister had been 
‘overruled’ by the Home Secretary on the issue of a minimum price for 
alcohol.

Mrs May, who is hailed as Britain’s 
answer to Angela Merkel by her allies, responded with what is becoming a
 trademark ‘death stare’.

Unusually, she did not take her seat 
on the Government front bench for Prime Minister’s Questions, instead 
watching proceedings from a position alongside the Speaker’s Chair.

Not concerned: The Prime Minister has said he does not want to be the 'popular guy' in the eyes of the press

The Home Secretary’s allies are 
infuriated by charges of disloyalty, insisting a weekend speech ranging 
far beyond her brief which was interpreted as paving the way for a 
future leadership bid was cleared personally in advance by Mr Cameron.

They were outraged by a leak from 
Tuesday’s political Cabinet revealing that she had been admonished by 
name by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Downing Street was forced to disown a
 report claiming that Mr Cameron had ‘long nurtured doubts about Theresa
 May’s effectiveness as Home Secretary’, insisting he had always 
regarded her as ‘first class’.

‘Say what you want about how sparkly 
or otherwise she is, she has been effective and even her enemies would 
concede that. This just makes them sound on another planet’ said one 
supporter of Mrs May.

But her camp was further enraged by 
BBC political editor Nick Robinson quoting people close to the Prime 
Minister as branding the Home Secretary ‘grotesquely naïve’.

Members of the Prime Minister’s inner
 circle, meanwhile, said they suspected the Home Office had leaked the 
fact that it has killed off the Prime Minister’s plan to impose a 45p 
per unit minimum price for alcohol.

Mrs May and other ministers, 
including her Liberal Democrat deputy Jeremy Browne and Commons leader 
Andrew Lansley – had suggested the move would be politically suicidal at
 a time when the cost of living is already rising.

Some of the Home Secretary’s 
colleagues agree that she has overstepped the mark, though her allies 
have made clear she would do nothing to challenge Mr Cameron and would 
only consider a leadership run if he quit after losing the next 
election.
