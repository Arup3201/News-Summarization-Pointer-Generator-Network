Inter Milan believe they have struck a deal to sign Lukas Podolski on a six-month loan deal but not until after Arsenal have played at Southampton on New Year's Day.

Representatives of the Italian club were in London on Saturday for meetings and are confident they will soon have Podolski in their ranks, who was an unused substitute in the Gunners' 2-1 win at West Ham on Sunday. Inter will pay a loan fee of £1.5million.

The unsettled Germany forward has one year on his Arsenal contract at the end of this season and may not return if his loan is successful.

Wenger was not willing to allow Podolski out before the game against Saints because Olivier Giroud is banned after his red card on Boxing Day.

'At the moment, nobody goes out,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We have Mesut Ozil back at the beginning of January, so we have a lot of competition up front.' 

Podolski has flourished in Europe this season but has been given limited opportunities in the Premier League.

The 29-year-old has scored three goals and all have come in the Champions League.
