The internet has gone into overdrive with memes and jokes about Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella's comical fall against Belgium.

Sabella was over-zealous in his response to 
forward Gonzalo Higuain hitting the bar against Belgium - leaning back 
too far in frustration and falling over.

Higuain had already put Argentina after eight minutes with a fine turn and shot but he went on a magnificent run before smashing a shot against the woodwork in the 65th minute.
