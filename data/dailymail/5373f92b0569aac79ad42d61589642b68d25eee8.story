Grieving daughters have been left distraught after their father's wedding ring was apparently stolen from his dead body while he lay in hospital.

Police have launched an investigation into the loss of Clive Thatcher's ring from the Bristol Royal Infirmary in February.

His relatives have accepted that they are 'not going to get it back' - but say they are adamant that the same horror must never be allowed to happen to anyone else.

Theft: Clive Thatcher, pictured, apparently had his wedding ring removed from his finger after his death

Mr Thatcher died aged 78 on February 24, after a two-week spell in hospital following a fall at his home in the Bristol neighbourhood of Southville.

His daughters tried to remove his wedding ring at the time, but were unable to do so because his hands were so swollen.

However, when an undertaker went to the hospital to pick up Mr Thatcher's body, the ring had gone missing.

The family also claims that around Â£5 in cash vanished from the locker besides the pensioner's hospital bed.

'The ring was stuck on his finger because his fingers were swollen,' his daughter Gloria Bond said. 'We managed to get another ring off, but not that one.

'When I arranged the funeral they asked if he still had any jewellery on him and I said about the ring on his wedding finger. She told me that when he was brought back they would be in touch for us to pick them up straight away because they didn't like to keep anything like that.

'They rang me on March 8 and told me they had Dad there but that he didn't have the ring on his finger. My jaw just dropped and I couldn't actually speak.'

Probe: Officials at the Bristol Royal Infirmary are currently investigating the upsetting incident

Mrs Bond's husband Gerald said that after Mr Thatcher died, a nurse put some tape around the ring to stop it slipping off his finger.

He added: 'We are not worried about the cost of the ring - we know we are not going to get it back because it has probably been melted down now, we are more concerned about it happening to other people.

'It is quite distressing that someone took the ring off someone's finger after they had died and basically pinched it.'

Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they were aware of the alleged incident, adding: 'Investigations are currently ongoing and we are working to establish the whereabouts of the item concerned.'

The University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said they were taking the incident 'extremely seriously'.

Chief nurse Helen Morgan said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about the Thatcher family's distressing experience.

'We are taking this matter extremely seriously and appreciate that this is a very difficult time for them.

'We are working with the family and our staff to investigate thoroughly and will share our findings with them once the investigation is complete.'
