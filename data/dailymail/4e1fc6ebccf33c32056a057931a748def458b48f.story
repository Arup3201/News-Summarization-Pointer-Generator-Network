Car enthusiasts who can’t afford a Tesla Model S luxury car’s six-figure price tag can spend the night in one – for just $85 (£58).

Steve Sasman is renting out his electric car, which retails for $118,000 (approximately £77,000), as overnight accommodation Airbnb, but there’s a pretty big catch for anyone who plans to sleep in.

Guests must be out of bed by 8am so he can drive to work.

The luxury car retails for $118,000 (approximately £77,000) and Mr Sasman charges $85 (£58) a night

And the price does not include a test drive in the car, which can go from 0 to 60mph in four seconds and reach a top speed of 130mph.

Billed as the world’s first Tesla hotel, the five-door liftback stays in the garage at Mr Sasman’s condominium in Phoenix, Arizona, when it is rented by one or two guests.

Mr Sasman bought the car four months ago and so far no one has taken him up on his offer.

He told CBS5: ‘I’ve already slept in this thing three times so why not let other people do it?’

Guests are provided with clean sheets, pillows and a blanket or comforter, plus two battery-powered candles

It comes with clean sheets, pillows and a blanket or comforter, plus two radio-controlled, battery-powered candles to set the mood.

Pets and smoking are banned.

The car does not use petrol, meaning its air conditioning or heat can be switched on all night despite it being parked in the garage in Phoenix’s Biltmore neighbourhood.

Guests have access to the kitchen, living room, television and private bathroom and shower in the condo.

In the listing on Airbnb, Mr Sasman wrote: ‘Want to experience the amazing Tesla Model S? Now is your chance to CAMP in a Tesla for the most unique stay possible.

‘The Tesla will be your “private room” but you still get access to a kitchen, TV room & bathroom/shower.’

He added: ‘You can set the mood with your selection of any internet music you would like on the huge 17in monitor. How often do you get to sleep in a $118,000 electric car?

‘As the Tesla is of course my transportation, I would request that you are up by 8am so I can get to work. However this is very flexible and we can agree on a time the night before of course!

‘You are free to hang out in the condo and even sleep in longer on the big comfy couch if you like.’

Mr Sasman, founder of the Vacation Owner’s Rental Guide, is a part-time Uber driver and he tells his guests that they can hire him to take them on guided tours for an extra fee.

The ‘Tesla hotel’ is one of Airbnb’s most unusual listings, with others ranging from train carriages and an old bread van in Norway to a retired aeroplane in the Netherlands to a pink minibus that once belonged to a Swedish fire department.
