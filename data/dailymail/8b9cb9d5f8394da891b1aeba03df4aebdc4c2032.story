Guilty: Wayne Scott, who was employed by Cleveland Police, has been convicted of a string of sex crimes

A former police officer has been convicted of a string of sex crimes - including eight rapes and two serious sexual offences against a child.

Wayne Scott, who was previously employed by Cleveland Police, was found guilty of the rape and attempted rape of a woman today after a five-day trial.

The 37-year-old had already admitted raping a different woman seven times over a number of years, a court heard.

Now, Scott's colleagues are appealing for any more of his victims to come forward.

Detective Superintendent Peter 
McPhillips, of Cleveland Police, said: 'I am pleased with the outcome 
given today.

'Wayne Scott is a sexual predator who has been a disgrace to
the office of constable and deserves to be behind bars.

'Scott was arrested in August 2011 following on-duty allegations, and subsequently suspended and dismissed.

'Our objective since has been to 
discover whether his behaviour was more widespread and to protect the 
public from him. That objective has now been achieved.'

During the trial, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Scott had ripped off his victim’s jeans and underwear before attempting to rape her. He had then raped her in his car in a subsequent attack.

Scott had already confessed to two common assaults, one sexual assault and two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual touching, the court heard.

He had also referred to himself as 'sexed up” during a police interview 
and had made advances to some of his former colleagues.

Today, Mr McPhillips paid tribute to the strength and courage of Scott’s victims as they had gone through the court process.

'The offences for which Scott has 
been convicted of today occurred off duty but as a police officer he 
knew better than most the severity of his crimes,' he said.

'He was a disgrace to his uniform and there can be no place for people like him in the police service.'

After the jury delivered its verdict, Judge James Goss QC said he would pass sentence on December 23. Scott has been remanded in custody until then.
