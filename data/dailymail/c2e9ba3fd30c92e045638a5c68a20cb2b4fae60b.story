Neil Lennon has warned that Bolton can cause an FA Cup upset at Liverpool on Saturday after revealing that he copied his training techniques from Brendan Rodgers.

Lennon studied his Northern Ireland compatriot’s coaching at Reading in 2009 before embarking on a managerial career at Celtic.

‘His training sessions were brilliant,’ Lennon said. ‘I still use some of them now, but don’t tell him — I don’t know if he has the copyright on them.

‘It will be the first time coming up against Brendan. We did have a pre-season game in Dublin a couple of years ago, but that doesn’t count.’

Lennon believes Bolton can spring a surprise against Rodgers’ side in a game that is worth £500,000 to the cash-strapped Championship club.

‘I’ve been in this situation before, with Celtic against big teams,’ added Lennon. ‘We will set out a team to compete, we’re not going there for the day out.’
