NHS doctors are referring gay patients to psychologists to ‘cure’ them of their sexuality, ministers were warned today.

MPs lined up to call for an end to the 'voodoo psychology' and bogus claims that people can be 'cured' of their sexuality.

Health minister Norman Lamb said the practice was 'utterly abhorrent' and warned no GP funded by the NHS should be referring patients for treatment to change their sexuality but ruled out statutory regulation.

Anger: Labour MP Sandra Osborne warned that conversion therapy poses a very real and present danger in Britain

A survey of 1,300 mental health 
professionals in 2009 found that 300 admitted to having attempted to 
change the sexuality of at least one patient.

More
than a third said their patients had been referred to them by GPs and 
40 per cent were treated in an NHS practice, Mrs Osborne added.

Labour MP Sharon Osborne said so-called conversion therapy poses a ‘very real and present danger in Britain’, as she demanded the government act to ban it.

“Conversion” or “reparative” therapy is the attempt by individuals, often posing as professionals, to try and alter the sexuality of lesbian, gay or bisexual patients.

Mrs Osborne told MPs: ‘Conversion therapy is a very real and present danger in Britain.

‘More than just a problem amongst religious fundamentalists, it’s an issue for the NHS and professional sector; and that this isn’t a simplistic debate about freedom to choose: if LGBT patients are coaxed into undertaking therapy by peer pressure or referred on to conversion therapists after approaching professionals, then this is hardly a “free choice” at all.’

Conversion therapy was a systemic problem in the 1950s and 1960s with teachers, NHS staff and the courts referring gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) to medical experts to try to ‘turn’ them straight.

Mrs Osborne added: During this period, all branches of psychology – from the cognitive, to the behavioural and the psychodynamic – had their own cruel and unpalatable methods of dealing with same-sex attraction.

‘Conversion therapy persisted and psychotherapy remains an unregulated profession in Britain.

‘Anyone in the country can set themselves up as a psychotherapist without being part of a professional body.’

Debate: MPs from all the main parties attended the debate in Westminster Hall to demand the government act

She warned that because many NHS staff received their training before homosexuality ceased to be classed as a mental illness.

‘Many professionals, quite simply, receive little training in what to do when a gay person approaches them expressing uneasiness about their sexuality.

‘There is a legitimate concern that some professionals in the NHS and elsewhere are referring LGBT patients on to conversion therapists.’

She called for psychotherapy become a 
protected profession in which nobody can legally call themselves a 
‘psychotherapist’ without being accredited to a professional body, like 
the Health and Care Professions Council.

‘The government’s current plans for a voluntary register of psychotherapists just don’t cut it.’

Last
year Boris Johnson blocked Christian campaigners from using 
advertisements on London buses to promote their message on 
homosexuality.

The London 
Mayor personally vetoed the campaign, which was due to start next week, 
because he said it suggested gay people can be cured.

The posters were backed by two Christian groups, the Core Issues Trust and Anglican Mainstream.

Post-gay and ex-gay are terms used to refer to homosexuals who have undergone spiritual or pastoral therapy and, according to Anglican Mainstream, have 'now left a homosexual lifestyle'.

Mrs Osborne told a Westminster Hall debate there must also be a better complaints system so that LGBT patients can ‘achieve justice’ if they are forced to undergo conversion therapy.

‘The Government could opt to ban conversion therapy for all under 18s - or go further with an all out ban for all age groups.

‘But then would an all out ban address the much broader issue of inadequate training of professionals in how to provide LGBT friendly public service provision.’

In July a petition was presented to Parliament with 2,000 signatures which stated that ‘being lesbian, gay or bi-sexual is not a disease, disorder or illness and cannot therefore be “cured” or changed’.

It warned ‘that “conversion” or “reparative” therapy does not work and can do serious harm to patients’.

Health minister Norman Lamb said the practice was 'utterly abhorrent' but ruled out statutory regulation at this stage

Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert said: ''In the 21st century no lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender indivudal should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology.

'Instead we should be providing services which help give them confidence and support them with their sexuaility.'

Health minister Mr Lamb has faced calls to ban conversion therapy in the past, but has insisted it was up to local NHS bodies.

Today he told MPs: 'I find this practice utterly abhorrent and has no place in a modern society. That’s my personal view.'

He said many of the questions raised in the debate were questions he had asked of ministers.

‘Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an illness to be treated or cured. We are concerned about this issue of so-called gay-to-straight conversion therapy.’

He said the Department of Health was ‘not aware’ of NHS doctors commissioning conversion therapy.

‘It is completely inappropriate for any GP to be referring people for this type of therapy. It’s not something that public money should have anything to do with.’
