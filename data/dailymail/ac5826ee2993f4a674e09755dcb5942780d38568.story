A Detroit man tried to throw a football loaded with heroin, marijuana, tobacco and multiple cellphones into the yard of a state prison, Michigan authorities say.

According to state police Trooper Toby Baker, Christen Deon-Sterling Moore's throw on Sunday came up short with the football landing between two fences and not in the yard where prisoners exercise.

An officer at the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility saw the man throw the football, and he was taken into custody.

The Detroit Free Press reports the ball contained heroin, marijuana, tobacco along with three cellphones and chargers.

The suspect is facing possession of illegal drugs with intent to deliver, smuggling and trespassing on prison property charges.

'After observing the passenger exit the vehicle and throw the football, our officer ran towards the vehicle and drew his Taser and told the driver to stop, which he did,' said Russ Marlan, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections.

Moore is charged with crimes related to delivery of heroin and marijuana and smuggling cell phones to prisoners.

Each is a five-year felony.

Moore has been arraigned but it was not clear whether he is free on bond.

'We take very seriously the security of our prisons and will prosecute any violations of contraband that occur,' Jackson County Prosecutor Jerry Jarzynka told the Free Press.

According to the newspaper corrections officers have complained that stopping manning gun towers and regular perimeter patrols at state prisons has made it easier to throw contraband over prison fences.

But prison officials say random patrols are more effective when teamed with better lighting and video surveillance.

'The idea to staff these randomly came from our wardens,' Marlan said, adding that there wasn't the return on investment for continuous manning of these posts.'
