An Arkansas middle school teacher is under fire after she accidentally showed a personal sex image to her class last week.

An x-rated photo of the unnamed female teacher somehow became mixed in with classwork through the teacher's iCloud account.

While the teacher even personally called parents to apologize and sent out an apology for the embarrassing mixup, she's now been disciplined by the Little Rock school board.

Oops: An Arkansas middle school teacher accidentally showed her students a photo of her performing a 'sex act' that she'd apparently uploaded to iCloud and shared with the class

And parents like Nicholas Tolerson, whose son was in the class and exposed to the material, say that may not be enough.

'My heart goes out to not only my son, but other kids in the classroom,' Tolerson told KARK.

Tolerson was one of the parents the teacher called after school on Wednesday. His son had come home announcing he'd seen a sex video.

'(My son) says she was performing sex acts,' said Tolerson.

Parents of the kids in the classroom, like Nicholas Tolerson, have demanded answers but feared the damage was already done 'My heart goes out to not only my son, but other kids in the classroom,' he said

While there's some discrepancy between what was actually seen--Tolerson's son said it was a video while the school maintains it was a fleeting still image--it's clear that the young teens saw something highly inappropriate.

'She was apologetic,' said Tolerson of the phone call he received from the teacher.

KARK also obtained a copy of the apology the teacher sent to each parent:

'Hello my name is [redacted] and I am your child's [redacted]. Today an unfortunate and embarrassing incident occurred during class

'An inappropriate picture that was taken on my personal phone was transferred to iPads in the classroom.

Disciplined: The unnamed Forest Heights teacher has apologized to all the parents, the class iPads in question have been wiped, and she's been disciplined by the Little Rock school board, though it was unclear if the teacher was terminated

'Unfortunately some of the students were exposed to the photo by accident. I would personally like to apologize for and inappropriate and unprofessional image that your child may or may not have seen.

'Please know that the photo was never intended for view by anyone here at the school. The incident is being investigated and appopriate sanctions for my actions will occur.

'Every measure is being taken to ensure that the picture is not accessible from any source.'

Each iPad's memory was wiped after the incident.

While it remained unclear Sunday what exact disciplinary action has been taken, KARK reports that she was punished under the Arkansas Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, which covers both terminations and suspensions.
