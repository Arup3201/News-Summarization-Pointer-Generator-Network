The lights are on but no one is at home at the headquarters of three of Britain’s largest energy companies - days after they announced huge price hikes.

In pictures which will anger customers across Britain, npower, Centrica and SSE appear content to burn the midnight oil in their own offices long after most workers have gone home.

The apparently deserted npower offices in Warndon, Worcester, are seen in the photographs to boast an empty car park bathed in light from the thousands of bulbs still burning at 7pm on Monday evening.

Days after announcing energy price hikes the headquarters of three of Britain's biggest energy companies, including the offices of npower in Warndon, Worcester, were bathed in light despite many workers having left for the day

Although many staff had left for the day when this photograph of the npower building was taken, lights were still on in the building. The firm recently announced an increase including an electricity price rise of 9.3 per cent and a gas price rise of 11.1 per cent

Earlier this month the company became the third major supplier to announce price rises, with a dual-fuel bill set to go up by a whopping 10.4 per cent.

The price rise will take effect on December 1, and is the highest increase announced by any supplier so far.

The npower increase includes an electricity price rise of 9.3 per cent and a gas price rise of 11.1 per cent. The move will affect 3.1 million customers.

The change will add an extra £137 to an annual average dual-fuel bill, taking it to £1,459.

Furious customer John Sadford, 30, who lives nearby, said: 'It’s an absolute joke that they can jack up everyone’s energy bill while lighting up their own office like a Christmas tree when virtually no one is there.

The startling scene was repeated at the head office of Centrica in Windsor, Berkshire, which was still lit up at 6.45pm

Centrica, parent company to British Gas, recently announced an increase of 8.4 per cent on gas and 10.4 per cent on electricity which will come into force on November 23

'It’s a kick in the teeth for customers like me who already struggle to make ends meet.'

The startling scene was repeated at the HQ of Centrica in Windsor, Berkshire, which was still lit up at 6.45pm.

The firm, parent company to British Gas, announced an increase of 8.4 per cent on gas and 10.4 per cent on electricity which will come into force on November 23.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the offices of SSE, formerly Scottish and Southern Energy, in Perth had just a handful of cars in the car park at 7.30pm on Monday, yet every light appeared to be on in the sprawling offices. Earlier this month the company unveiled an 8.2 per cent price rise for its 4.4 million electricity customers and 2.9 million gas users, despite announcing £1.41 billion pre-tax profits in March.

Under pressure customers will see their annual dual fuel bill rise by £106 to £1,380 when the hike comes into effect on November 15.

One of those customers is Gary Waywell, 56, from Watchet, Somerset, who has been a SSE customer for eight years.

He said he was surprised by the size of the price rise and angry at the timing just before winter.

'I can hardly go to my boss and say, ‘would you mind giving me an extra £16 a week for the winter.' he said.

'I don’t think he is going to smile at that.'

All three of the energy companies photographed have been approached for comment.

The move has amplified political debate about the issue of energy bills.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election, described SSE’s price rise as a 'scandal'.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze energy prices if his party is elected, although Prime Minister David Cameron has branded the promise a 'con', saying his rival could not control the price of gas worldwide

He has accused the government of 'letting energy companies get away with this'.

However, Prime Minister David Cameron branded Mr Miliband’s price freeze plan as a 'con', saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas.

Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Right Reverend Justin Welby, himself a former oil executive, has stepped into the row when he said he understood the anger over apparently ‘inexplicable’ rises and called on the companies ‘to behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity’.

He hit out after British Gas announced a 9.2 per cent hike, despite parent company Centrica recording a £2.7 billion profit last year.
