A faithful dog is seen pushing its elderly owner's wheelchair though Russian floodwaters.

The incredible video, filmed from a passing car at an unknown location, shows the dog struggling along on its hind legs through water almost a metre deep.

A voice off camera is heard to remark in Russian: 'Good Lord he's being pushed by his dog.'

A helping paw: A faithful dog pushes his elderly owner's wheelchair through floodwater

The clip was uploaded to YouTube last week. Some users point out that no one had stopped to help the man. Others have suggested the dog may be simply hanging on to its owner rather than pushing him.

The only clue to the location is the fact that the video is Russian.

However Russia has remained largely unaffected by the recent floods which have brought chaos to large parts of central Europe, suggesting the clip may have been filmed some time ago.

Good boy: Some YouTube users have commented on the fact no one had stopped to help the man

In April, hundreds of people were forced from their homes in Russia’s Voronezh and Saratov regions after rivers flooded due to record snowfalls.

The torrential weather this spring has sent the Elbe, the Danube and other rivers such as the Vltava and the Saale overflowing their banks.

The resulting floods have caused extensive damage in central and southern Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary.

The elderly man gestures towards the car from where the incident was filmed. The only clue as to the location is a Russian voice in the background remarking: 'Good Lord he's being pulled by his dog'
