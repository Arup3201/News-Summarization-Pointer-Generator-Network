A British holidaymaker is fighting for her life after a quad bike accident in Spain.

Lisa Darlington, 45, is in a critical condition with serious head injuries after falling from the vehicle on the island of Ibiza.

Police said she was riding as a passenger on the quad, being driven by her son Danny, 21.

Crash: The accident happened on a road near Cala Llonga, a popular beach resort on the island's south east coast, at around 9pm last Thursday

A police source confirmed local reports that he had been arrested for driving the vehicle without a licence.

He is thought to have lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a stone wall.

The accident happened on a road near Cala Llonga, a popular beach resort on the island’s south east coast, at around 9pm last Thursday.

Mrs Darlington was taken by ambulance to hospital where she underwent emergency surgery.

It is understood she is being kept in a drug-induced coma in intensive care.

Her son was taken to the island’s Can Misses hospital with minor injuries but was released the same day.

The accident is being investigated by the Civil Guard’s traffic department.

A police source said: 'It appears he lost control and his mother was very seriously injured as she came off the quad bike and banged her head.

'We’re still investigating what made him lose control.'

He is said to have rented the quad bike using a provisional UK driving licence, when a full licence is required to drive the vehicle on a road.

Danny appeared before an investigating magistrate and was released on bail. He went straight from the court to be at his mother’s bedside in hospital.

He has not been charged with any offence.

It is the fourth quad bike accident on the island already this month and the sixth since June.

On September 9 a British couple, aged 64 and 52, were run down by a quad bike in the party town of San Antonio.

They were struck as they crossed a busy road at a crossing point at 3pm.

The 52-year-old woman suffered multiple injuries while both the man’s legs were injured.

And in July a French woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries after falling from a quad near Cala Jondal.
