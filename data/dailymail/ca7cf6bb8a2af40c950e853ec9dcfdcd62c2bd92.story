Some of the trophies stolen from Formula One team Red Bull's factory have been found dumped in a lake, it has been revealed.

More than 60 trophies were stolen after a gang of six men used a vehicle to ram the front entrance of the team's building in Milton Keynes at around 1.30am on December 6.

Thames Valley Police said that around 20 of the prizes were recovered from Horseshoe Lake near Sandhurst Monday after being spotted by a member of the public.

Red Bull's factory in Milton Keynes was smashed by a silver 4x4 - about 20 trophies were found in a lake

Detective Constable Chris Oakman said: 'We estimate about 20 trophies have been recovered, but we are liaising with Red Bull to establish the exact number, as some of the trophies are damaged.'

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the manner in which some trophies were found showed the disregard the criminals had for the objects stolen.  

'It's good news that some of our trophies have been found and thanks to the police for all their help so far,' he said on the Red Bull Racing website.  

'The fact that some of the trophies were discarded in a lake and damaged shows how senseless this crime was. 

'While the trophies mean an enormous amount to the team, their intrinsic value is low – and the extent of the damage that was caused to the factory by the offenders during the break-in was significant. 

'Hopefully we can get the trophies back to our factory where they belong and get replicas made of those that we can't. Thanks to everyone involved for their help so far.' 

The damage to the factory after the building was ram-raided was clear from the outside

After the robbery, Horner warned fans of the Austrian team which won the F1 constructors' championship and drivers' championship from 2010-2013 would be victims too with access to the site likely to be limited in the future.

'The break-in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time,' Horner said.

'The offenders took items that not only did not belong to them, but which represented the efforts of a group of dedicated, hard-working individuals.

'Beyond the aggressive nature of this break-in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. 

Team principal Christian Horner said the 'break-in caused significant damage' and said it could affect fans

'But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.

'The actions of these men mean it's likely that we will have to make our site less accessible in the future, which will be unfair on the hundreds of fans that travel to visit our factory each year to see our trophies and our Formula One car.'
