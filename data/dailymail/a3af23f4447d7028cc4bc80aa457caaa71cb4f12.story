Jailed: Simon Heritage, 38, of Coventry, West Midlands, was arrested within hours of the attack

A Halloween rapist kidnapped an 11-year-old boy at knifepoint as he walked home after trick-or-treating with friends, a court heard yesterday.

Simon Heritage, 38, of Coventry, West Midlands, was arrested within hours of the sex attack after giving the young victim his home address.

Heritage was jailed for 12 years at Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa yesterday, pleading guilty to two charges of raping the boy.

The boy went out trick-or-treating with friends and when they separated at 6.45pm he set off to walk home, where he was expected by 7pm.

But he felt a knife in his back as Heritage told him: ‘Don't make noise or I'll kill you’, prosecutor Aliya Rashid said.

The boy tried to get his phone to dial 999, but Heritage snatched it from him and, threatening to kill him if he moved, held the knife to his neck and ordered him to walk.

When the boy stopped, he told him to keep moving and pulled him onto the driveway of a house where he ordered the boy to take off his clothes. At that moment the boy's phone rang and Heritage handed it to him.

He told him to tell his mother he would be two hours and to hang up, which he did.

His mother called back, but he again said he would be home in two hours and hung up, after which Heritage told him to turn off his phone.

In the darkness the boy asked Heritage 'why me?' and asked what he was going to do, at which Heritage said he was going to have sex with him.

The boy pleaded with him to stop but Heritage sexually assaulted and raped him. Heritage gave the boy his home address, before letting him go and telling him to visit the next day.

The boy told his parents what happened and the police arrested Heritage at his home that night. Heritage admitted what he had done and said he was 'eight out of ten drunk' after going to a funeral.

He said he had then gone home, got a knife and went out looking for someone to sexually assault, explaining that he 'would prefer a girl, but didn't mind'. Asked why, he said it was because he felt 'left out' because everyone else was doing it.

Mrs Rashid added that as a result of 
his ordeal, the boy says he is now scared to go out in the dark, has 
flashbacks which makes it difficult for him to sleep and finds it 
difficult to concentrate at school.

Denis
Desmond, defending, said there was a psychiatric report on Heritage 
which made it clear he had 'significant learning difficulties'. He pointed out that Heritage had no 
previous convictions and, having acted 'completely out of character, had
made full admissions at the police station'.

'He had been abducted from the street and you used a knife to press home your attack. The extent of the damage to the boy is unknown, but will be lasting'

Judge Marten Coates

Heritage had also admitted kidnapping the boy, causing him to take part in sexual activity and possessing a knife.

Jailing Heritage, Judge Marten Coates, said: ‘The aggravating features are that there was premeditation and planning on your part, and the attack was sustained.

‘He had been abducted from the street and you used a knife to press home your attack. The extent of the damage to the boy is unknown, but will be lasting.’

The judge ordered him to register as a sex offender for life and imposed a sexual offences prevention order banning him from having unsupervised contact with children.

He also banned him from ever doing any paid or unpaid work which could bring him into contact with children.
