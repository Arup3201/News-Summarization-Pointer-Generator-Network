Mercedes recently teased a self-driving truck that it claims could hit the roads within the next decade.

And now, the German firm has removed the camouflage from its Future Truck 2025 prototype to reveal even more features, including how the truck's 'Highway Pilot' will scan the road ahead.

In addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track, the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control.

The German firm has taken the cover off of its Future Truck 2025 prototype (pictured) to reveal more features, including how the truck's 'Highway Pilot' scans the road ahead. In addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track, the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control

The prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a German Autobahn in July, during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck-maker Daimler.

During
 the trial, the truck was covered in a camouflage, and trucker Hans Luft was seen toying conspicuously with an iPad 
behind the wheel of the 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle.

Clad
 in mystery-enhancing adhesive foil, the Mercedes prototype is equipped 
with aerodynamic fins and radar that scans the road 250 meters ahead.

The system constantly monitors cars around it to stay in the same lane, and keep at the optimum speed set by the driver.

It
 also makes fuller use of features already found in current production 
models, by networking on-board sensors with automatic braking, stability
 control and lane-warning systems.

Once
 the system is switched on, the driver's seat can become an office chair
 or swivels to a 'rest position', Daimler said - potentially allowing 
vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for 
truckers.

However, to overtake or change lane, the driver must take manual control.

This camouflage has now been removed.

On the front of the truck is a series of LEDs, 
which illuminate the front fascia and headlights when the 
engine is started.

When the lights flash orange, it alerts fellow drivers to the fact the truck is driving itself, and these lights turn blue when a human driver is back in control.

Images of 
the Future Truck 2025 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining
 driver's seat, tablet computer controls and 'mirrors' and a chill-out 
space.

The 
driver’s seat can also be turned by 45 degrees, to make it more 
comfortable on long journeys, and the tablet can be removed and used to 
watch films, for example, when the truck is in autonomous mode.

The truck is also equipped with radar sensors and camera 
technology that helps the autonomous driving system, 
called Highway Pilot, plot the road ahead.

The 
technology is similar to how an autopilot on an aircraft works, and in 
the Future Truck 2025, the stereo camera scans the road 328ft (100 
metres) ahead; 45 degrees 
horizontally and 27 degrees vertically.

These cameras can identify single and two-lane roads, obstacles including moving and stationary objects, 
pedestrians and more.

The camera is fitted to the instrument panel behind the windscreen.

Future Truck 2025 also 
makes fuller use of features already found in current production models,
 by networking on-board sensors with automatic braking, stability 
control and lane-warning systems.

As the vehicle's name suggests, the intention is to launch a roadworthy version by 2025.

The
 vehicle is still a prototype, and is still undergoing tests, but it has
 been built to travel at speeds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph).

The
 world's biggest truckmaker is confident its technology can 
overcome regulatory and legal hurdles - even if the scale of wage and 
fuel savings on offer spells likely conflict with freight unions in the 
long run.

Following the tests in July, Daimler Trucks chief Wolfgang Bernhard said: 'Autonomous driving will revolutionise road freight transport and create major benefits,' said

'We
 aim to be the number one manufacturer in this market of the future 
which we believe will offer solid revenue and earnings potential.'

'This truck will not just remain a prototype,' Bernhard said.

The German firm demonstrated a camouflaged version of the Future Truck 2025 prototype in July. It was driven on a German Autobahn, and was a major step in an escalating race to develop self-driving vehicles

In addition to Google's self-driving cars, Sweden's 
Scania, a unit of Volkswagen, is also working on 'platooning' 
technology that allows several trucks to travel in tight convoy with a 
sole human driver in the lead vehicle.

Autonomous
 driving proponents face the twin challenges of meeting safety concerns 
while persuading lawmakers that accident liability can still be 
established.

But the potential gains may offer powerful incentives to overcome them.

Daimler
 said its truck model still requires human oversight while freeing the 
driver to perform back-office tasks such as handling bookings and 
billing, or planning future itineraries.

Fuel
 and driver wages each account for 27 per cent of current operating costs
 for a typical haulage firm, according to a study by France's CNR, a 
government agency that monitors the sector.

'Once you include travelling expenses, total driver costs rise to a full third, the biggest item,' a CNR official said.

During the trial, trucker Hans Luft was toying conspicuously with an iPad behind the wheel of his 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle

Even
 without removing the drivers, he added, 'their share of total cost will
 fall if there are other productivity gains - if you use a little less 
driver for a given distance, so to speak.'

The automated vehicles also save fuel by driving more economically, according to Daimler.

Even
 once legal and technological obstacles are cleared, however, 
self-driving trucks may face further resistance - not least from unions 
that wield serious clout in many countries.

'We would have concerns,' said Adrian Jones, a transport official at Unite, Britain's biggest union.

'We need to maintain the very high standards that we've got,' he said.

'What's the point being there if you're not paying any attention and you're not supervising in effect?'

Opposition
 is also likely in France, where the government last year scrapped an 
environmental truck tax after widespread protests brought highways to a 
halt.

Labor
 representatives will be 'extremely vigilant about the impact on jobs, 
wages and road safety' if attempts are made to introduce self-driving 
trucks, the Paris-based CFDT union said.'We
 must resist any temptation to consider that a driver is resting when 
the truck is on auto-pilot,' spokesman Fabian Tosolini.

'That's not what happens in planes, for good reason.'

How it works: The truck can scan the road ahead for vehicles and monitor them, ensuring there are no collisions. The driver's seat can become an office chair or swivels to a 'rest position', Daimler said - potentially allowing vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for truckers.

A tablet is used to control the system, and drivers can also see routes and information about the truck
