England will have to play their home games at Wembley for the next eight to nine years until the Football Association is debt free for the payment of the stadium, according to Club England managing director Adrian Bevington.

The Three Lions host Norway on Wednesday with what is expected to be the lowest attendance for an international match at the new Wembley.

The top-tier of the 90,000-capacity venue will be shut for the friendly with a crowd of 35,000-40,000 predicted to arrived to watch the clash.

Small crowd: Wembley stadium is expected have it's lowest attendance for an England match on Wednesday

The small crowd is a knock-on effect of England's disappointing World Cup campaign where they finished bottom of their group with two defeats and a draw from three matches.

In addition, the lack of high-profile opponents for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has also led to concerns about filling the 90,000-capacity venue in the future.

Bevington said on his Twitter account: 'People asking to take games around the country. Fair question, but fact is FA has contract with Wembley to play all home games there.

'Re Wembley. It has to be paid for. Reality is FA has to put events calendar on to do this.'

Bevington accepts that work was needed to 'regain support and rebuild excitement with England' after the disappointment of the World Cup, but pointed out that several England games at the old Wembley in the build-up to Euro 96 had attendances of well under 30,000.

Last week, FA general secretary Alex Horne announced England will play four prestige friendlies against world champions Germany, Spain, Italy and France over the next two years - some home and some away.

The previous lowest crowd for an international at the stadium was the 48,876 for a friendly against Sweden in 2011.
