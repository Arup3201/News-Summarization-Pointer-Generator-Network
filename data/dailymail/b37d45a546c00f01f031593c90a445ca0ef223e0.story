Security is to be stepped up around the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during an official visit to New York amid widespread demonstrations over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of local police.

Thousands of protesters have flooded the city's streets after it was revealed officers who killed father of six Eric Garner would not face criminal charges.  

The disruption comes ahead of the Royal couple's three-day tour of the US, during which Prince William will be hosted by President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, at the White House.

Tonight it was claimed the couple, who are expecting their second child, will be given extra security by the New York Police Department in light of recent turmoil. 

While an NYPD spokesman declined to comment, they confirmed the Duke and Duchess 'will be getting security.' 

Sources close to the couple, who will be joined with their own team of Scotland Yard bodyguards, however said they will be subject to extra precautions.  

‘There is no suggestion of a direct threat to the Duke and Duchess whatsoever but the way these demonstrations are spreading is being taken into account when planning their movement,’ said one.

William and Kate are due to arrive in New York on Sunday afternoon where they will be staying – like William’s late mother before him – at the Carlyle Hotel, where a suite costs £9,000.

The couple will undertake a whirlwind trip, packing seven public engagements in two days. 

On their first night, the Duke and Duchess attend a private dinner held on behalf of American Friends of the Royal Foundation in New York.

The foundation was set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 and was heavily involved in the organisation of the Invictus Games.

Tensions continue to flare in New York City following a Grand Jury decision not to bring charges against a police officer involved in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed father of six who died after being put in a chokehold by NYPD police officers. 

Mr Garner, 43, was stopped in the street on Staten Island in July on the suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. 

After an altercation with one of the police officers, the asthma-sufferer was placed in a chokehold on the ground. 

Struggling for breath, he can be heard in a video of the incident telling officers: 'I can't breathe'. 

The man later became unresponsive. A coroner ruled his death was the result of pressure on his chest while being restrained. 

Widespread pressure on the justice system to indite the police officers involved in his death came to a head this week when it was revealed they would not face prosecution. 

Thousands of protesters have clashed with authorities in New York City, with one crowd blocking off the Brooklyn Bridge. 

President Obama welcomed the city's announcement to increase police presence in protest-stricken areas, adding that the country has a sense of 'deep unfairness' over the case. 

During his visit, the Prince will be hosted by President Barack Obama in Washington DC while Kate remains in New York.  

Tonight a White House spokesman said it welcomed the Prince's devotion to the issue, describing it as 'both a national security threat and a devastating environmental problem.'  

His visit comes almost thirty years after Prince Charles and Diana were hosted by then President Ronald Regan and his wife, Nancy, in 1985. 

In New York, Duchess will carry out two solo engagements  accompanied by city's First Lady, Chirlane McCray.

The two women will visit a local child development centre and a lunch, hosted by the British Consul General, to celebrate the achievements of a successful British community in New York from the culture, arts, hospitality and business sectors.

As Patron of the University of St Andrews 600th Anniversary Campaign, the prince, accompanied by his wife, who met while students at the college, will also attend a Gala Dinner attended by stars including actor Tom Hanks. 

Time has also been set aside for a visit to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum and even an NBA Basketball game, where many are hoping they will be introduced to fans Beyonce and Jay Z.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said neither royal had been to New York before and were hugely looking forward to the visit. 

'The couple really are very much looking forward to all the special moments of the visit.

'They've been an integral part in planning it,' a spokesman said.
