A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub.

In addition to this, she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People.

She had also been drinking heavily.

A new report claims that Bobbi Kristina Brown (above) was under the influence of drugs the morning she was found face down and unresponsive in the bathtub

Sources say she used drugs as she was 'distraught' over the death of her mother three years earlier

Brown had also been 'in and out' of rehab for three years these same sources claim, and was 'distraught' still over her mother's death three years ago.

One of the sources who regularly saw the 21-year-old said Brown seemed to frequently be 'high' and was often 'slurring her words.'

She has been on life support ever since she was rushed to the hospital after being found by her possible husband Nick Gordon, and remains in critical condition. 

Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown referred to each other as husband and wife, but father Bobby Brown said they never legally married. 

Earlier this week she was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection and given a tracheotomy.

Few details about the young woman's condition have been revealed since she entered the hospital, and her father, the rapper and former member of New Edition, has asked that the media not take interviews from the numerous family members who have come forward to speak about his daughter's condition.

This as Gordon has reportedly become the main focus in a criminal investigation into what caused this incident.

Police in Roswell, Georgia, are investigating the circumstances leading to Brown's discovery in the tub on January 31.

She had been in a car crash four days earlier, according a police report. The SUV she was driving spun out of control and hit a car on January 27, causing extensive damage to both vehicles and sending her passenger and the driver of the other car to the hospital, the report said.

The other driver was listed in critical condition, police said, and one of Brown's tires was punctured by a nail and appeared to have blown out.
