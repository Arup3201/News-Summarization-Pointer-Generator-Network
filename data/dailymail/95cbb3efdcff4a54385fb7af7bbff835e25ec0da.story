Barack Obama was at the centre of a security breach today after it emerged pictures of him pumping iron in a private gym had been leaked.

US security experts are trying to find out how the unauthorised snaps of the president working out on his trip to Poland were secretly taken.

It appears Mr Obama was in his 5-star Marriot hotel gym taking time out from his busy schedule in the capital Warsaw when it happened.

US security experts are trying to find out how a Polish tabloid managed to get private pictures of President Barack Obama working out in a gym

Witnesses say the president worked out for about 30 minutes before retiring

The president has certainly taken his wife's 'Let's Move' campaign to heart

He was seen wearing a dark blue track suit over a white T-shirt as he exercised for around half an hour.

Mr Obama then retired to his luxury $1,500 per night presidential suite on the top floor of the 40-floored tower. Pictures of the session were later published in a Polish tabloid.

The suite Mr Obama is staying in also hosted Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2010. He is in the Polish capital to kick off his European tour.

Local snapper Marek Kwiatkowski said:
 'I know the gym, it isn't possible to snap these shots from outside, 
they must have had someone on the inside or maybe a hidden camera?'

Spread over 150sq m and two levels, the presidential suite is one of the most prestigious guest accommodation suites Warsaw offers.

On the ground level is a grand piano and bar and a winding staircase leading to two bedrooms on the upper level.

Obama, who arrived yesterday, will today meet the new Ukrainian President Poroshenko, and will later attend celebrations to mark the 1989 anniversary celebrations of Poland's first free elections before flying to Brussels.
