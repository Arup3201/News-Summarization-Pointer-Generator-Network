Germany forward Thomas Muller insists that he is not thinking about winning the Golden Boot for a second successive World Cup - despite netting a hat-trick against Portugal.

Joachim Low's side hammered Cristiano Ronaldo and his nation 4-0 in Salvador, putting Germany in control of Group G and Muller at the top of the goalscoring charts.

But the 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward is fully focused on helping Germany win the tournament and not the personal glory that comes with the Golden Boot, a trophy he won in South Africa in 2010 after scoring five goals and contributing more assists than his rivals.

Muller said: 'Let’s remain objective here, this was just the first match.

'We just want to be world champions and if we do that, records may or may not come, but we have other things to focus on.

'A hat-trick at the World Cup doesn’t happen every day of course, but I have had a good run at World Cups and I wanted to pick up where I left off.

'I am known for giving my utmost, but no one could have assumed that would happen and I can’t say that will happen again in the next match, but I’ll certainly try.'

And Muller's German team-mate, defender Mats Hummels, is remaining positive about his future participation in Brazil despite picking up an injury in Monday's encounter.

The Borussia Dortmund defender limped off the field and he undergo tests to reveal the extent of his thigh injury.

The 25-year-old scored Germany’s second goal against Portgual, powering in a header from a corner, and he told Sportl television: 'The injury doesn’t feel like something which would end my World Cup.

'Maybe it will cost me one game, or maybe none at all.

'It looked worse than it is. I do have my thigh heavily strapped, but it’s going to be fine. It could have been worse.'

However, the German FA are less confident that Hummels will be fit for Germany's next match against Ghana on Saturday following a magnetic resonance imaging test of the injury.

They said on their website: 'Hummels suffered a contusion in his right thigh with bleeding into the muscle.'

'It will depend on the further healing when he will be able to resume training or whether he can plan in the second Group G match against Ghana in Fortaleza on Saturday.'

Hummels's fellow defender Jerome Boateng also suffered an injury against Portugal, partially tearing ligaments in his right thumb.

'Boateng will have to wear a protective splint for six weeks with which he can play with after the approval of each respective referee,' the DFB said.
