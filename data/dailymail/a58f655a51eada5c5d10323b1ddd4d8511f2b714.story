In the clash of the corsets, Downton Abbey crushed the BBC revival of Upstairs Downstairs.

But when it comes to rival department store costume dramas, the corporation is determined not to be beaten.

It is rushing out The Paradise, a series set in a 19th-century department store, to beat ITV’s Mr Selfridge to our screens.

Battle of the period dramas: The BBC brings forward The Paradise in a bid to beat ITV's Mr Selfridge to our screens

The show, which had been expected to start next year, will now begin on Tuesday, September 25. The corporation hopes to avoid a repeat of its Upstairs Downstairs relaunch, which suffered in the shadows of ITV’s hit.

The BBC drama was cancelled after two series, while Downton returns for a third run tomorrow.

The Paradise’s launch comes amid a war of words, with the BBC accusing ITV of copying its idea. An insider said: ‘It’s peculiar that months after we announce a drama about a department store, they [ITV] saw fit to do exactly the same thing. BBC bosses weren’t best thrilled . . . so we are pleased to get it out first.’

The corporation has not even finished filming its latest eight-part drama, which is based on a novel by French author Emile Zola. The book’s Paris store has been relocated to North-East England for the TV adaptation, which features Sarah Lancashire.

An advert featuring a man choking to 
death will be shown during tomorrow’s new episode of Downton Abbey. St 
John Ambulance has taken out the expensive 60-second slot to encourage 
more people to learn first aid. The ad will depict a cancer survivor 
choking at a barbecue because no one knows how to help him. Although it 
will air after the 9pm watershed, it is likely to provoke complaints due
to its grim content.

ITV is yet to confirm the start date of Mr Selfridge, which charts the life of the American tycoon behind the shop.

The programme, based on the book Shopping, Seduction and Mr Selfridge by Lindy Woodhead, stars US actor Jeremy Piven as Harry Gordon Selfridge and has been written by Andrew Davies, whose credits include the BBC’s famous adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth. An ITV source said ‘any suggestion that we have copied another channel would be completely inaccurate and untrue’.
