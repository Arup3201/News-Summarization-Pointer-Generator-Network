He has covered most of the major sporting events in all corners of the world.

But now Andy Hooper, the Daily Mail’s leading sports photographer, has seen his work receive the official stamp of approval.

A special set of souvenir stamps featuring action shots taken by the 52-year-old photographer to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games went on sale this week.

The action shots featured on the stamps, created to celebrate the 2014 Commonwealth Games, were taken by Daily Mail photographer Andy Hooper

Andy Hooper supplied six pictures to feature on the special set of Commonwealth Games stamps. The photos were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations

Hooper, who is a four-time winner of the Sports Photographer of the Year award, has nearly 20 years' experience of photographing major sporting events for the Daily Mail all around the world.

Based at the Mail’s headquarters in London, he spoke of his delight at being given the commission to provide the photographs.

He said: ‘I was approached by  the Royal Mail and asked if I could supply six pictures to feature on the special set of stamps.

‘They were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations.

‘When I saw the end result I was naturally delighted and very honoured to be involved in this project.’

The only major sticking point in the exercise was disguising the identities of the sportsmen and woman involved in the six different sports recognised on the stamps.

The photographer explained: ‘One of the stipulations was that you are not allowed to show any living person on a stamp, so it went against the grain that the images were not sharp.

‘However, the photographs I supplied obviously were but then the illustrator got to work on them to ensure we worked within the guidelines.’

Unfortunately the Mail cameraman will not be involved when the spectacle begins next week.

He said: ‘Having just returned from the World Cup finals in Brazil, and then, the Open golf tournament, I have family holiday commitments in place.

‘But I will be there in spirit, if nothing else.’

Last year he added another prestigious award to his collection when he triumphed at The Press Photographer's Year awards.His excellent picture of rider Laura Collett jumping a Stonehedge-themed obstacle on horse Natterjack at the Barbury International Horse Trials scooped first prize in the 'Sports Features' category.

Hooper was also commended in the 'Sports Specialist folio of the Year' category for his shot of Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius face-to-face with a cheetah on a game reserve in his native South Africa.
