Jeb Bush, the newest front-runner among Republicans seeking their party's 2016 presidential nomination, smoked marijuana in high school – an activity he describes as 'pretty common' at the tony Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.

He told The Boston Globe in an interview published ahead of Sunday's edition that 'I drank alcohol and I smoked marijuana when I was at Andover.'

Both activities were strictly forbidden at the time – and still are – and could have gotten him expelled.

But 'it was pretty common,' he insisted.

Bush, once a 6-foot, 4-inch high school senior, was also seen as a bully by some of his classmates, notably one who weighed less than 100 pounds. Another said he was 'a cigarette smoker and "toker".'

Reactions to the news were varied. A spokesman for potential Republican presidential challenger Donald Trump told Daily Mail Online that 'Jeb put out the least of his substance issues today.'

News reports of Bush's past pot smoking date back to at least 1998, but his frank admission is new.

It's common for presidential hopefuls to 'dump' unflattering news about themselves early in election cycles, in the hope that it will be considered 'old news' by the time heir opponents gear up opposition-research activities.

The St. Petersburg Times in Bush's home state of Florida profiled him in October 1998 when he was the state's commerce secretary.

'The academics and the competitiveness' at Andover 'jolted him,' the Times reported. 'He nearly flunked his first year.'

'He began to experiment with drugs, smoking marijuana on more than one occasion and drinking alcohol.'

Bush all but admitted the reporting was spot-on at the time. 

'I still adhere to the belief that there should be a statute of limitations on behavior,' he said. 'There's got to be some tolerance for our imperfections. I'm imperfect. I was more imperfect when I was young.'

Five years later, when he was nearing the end of his first term as Florida's governor, the Washington Post treated Bush's marijuana-smoking days as anything but a bombshell.

'Jeb struggled with his course work' at Andover, the Post reported in February 2003. He 'missed Texas and experimented with marijuana.'

Several of the potential 2016 Republican pesidential candidates have admitted smoking pot in the past:

Aside from Jeb Bush, there are at least four.

Squeaky-clean moral crusader Rick Santorum, a former Senator from Pennsylvania, awkwardly admitted in 2011 that 'when I was in college ... I smoked pot and that was something that I did when I was in college … It was something that I’m not proud of, but I did.'

'I did and I admitted it,' Santorum added. 'I would encourage people not to do so. It was not all it’s made up to be.'

Newt Gingrich said in 1995 when he was Speaker of the House that smoking pot 'was a sign we were alive and in graduate school in that era.'

Former New York Governor George Pataki put his pot experimentation on the record during his first campaign for the office in 1994. 

And Sarah Palin, the GOP's vice presidential nominee in 2008, told the Anchorage Daily News two years earlier during her Alaska governorship that she smoked pot in her pre-politics days.

'I can't claim a Bill Clinton and say that I never inhaled,' she said.

College friends of Kentucky Senator Rand Paul have said he joined them in the occasional toke, but he hasn't admitted it.

'Randy smoked pot, [and] he made fun of Baptists,' a former cohort from Paul's Baylor University secret society, the NoZe Brotherhood, said in 2010.

Former Preident George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father, wrote in 1971 that 'Jebby is going to need some help I am sure.'

'He is a free and independent spirit and I don't want him to get totally out of touch with the family.' 

The Globe interviewed Peter Tibbetts, a Bush contemporary at Andover,who recalled that he had helped Bush bully another student before he himself was kicked out of school for doing drugs.

'Their target was a short classmate whom they taunted, and then sewed his pajama bottoms so that they were impossible to put on,' the Globe reports. 

Tibbetts said he is remorseful for participating in making 'cruel' sport of the smaller kid. 

Bush said he doesn't remember it that way.

'I don’t believe that is true,” he said, referring to others' accounts of his alleged bullying. 

'It was 44 years ago and it is not possible for me to remember.' 

But his classmates remember.

'Jeb Bush was large, physically imposing, and traveled in a crowd that was I guess somewhat threatening to an outsider like myself,' former dormmate Gregg Hamilton said. 

'I saw him as a cigarette smoker and "toker" and someone that was comfortable being in charge of a group. I was small physically, and small at an all-male boarding school [that], at that time, was a bit of a hostile environment for the kids.'

Hamilton recalled the dor, Pemberton Cottage, as a 'sort of a "Lord of the Flies" situation, at least as I saw it.' 

Bush has talked about his Andover years before, casting himself in one Miami Herald interview as 'a cynical little turd at a cynical school.'

'It was a difficult time for me,' he told the Herald. 'I was 14 when I left Houston to go to Andover and it was a very cynical time. The school for all sorts of reasons in the early 70s was cynical, not the same way it is now. It was a very Darwinian place.'

Despite the national news a politician with TNC in his history makes, it's nothing new.

President Barack Obama famously smoked weed in his youth as part of a group of friends he affectionately called the 'Choom Gang.'

Bill Clinton, asked about his pot-smoking past during the 1992 presdiential campaign, admitted that 'when I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale and never tried it again.'

The late Christopher Hitchens, who attended Oxford University with Clinton during the future president's Rhodes Scholar year, claimed later that Clinton was partial to pot brownies instead.

Obama, by contrast, made no bones about enjoying a good toke.

'When I was a kid, I inhaled, frequently,' he said in 2008. 'That was the point.'

President George W. Bush, Jeb's older brother, reportedly experimented with cocaine during his youth.

He never explicitly admitted smoking marijuana, although he hinted at it in discussions with his biographer Douglas Wead.

'I wouldn't answer the marijuana questions,' the 43rd president recalled. 'You know why? Because I don't want some little kid doing what I tried.'

President John F. Kennedy tried marijuana for chronic back pain, according to the book 'John F. Kennedy: A Biography,' which drew its account from former Washington Post executive Jim Truitt.

'On the evening of July 16, 1962, according to Jim Truitt, Kennedy and Mary Meyer smoked marijuana together.'

Meyer was reportedly one of Kennedy's mistresses.

FIELDS OF DREAMS: James Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking marijuana

'The president smoked three of the six joints Mary brought to him,' according to the book. 'At first he felt no effects. Then he closed his eyes and refused a fourth joint. "Suppose the Russians did something now," he said.'

Several of America's founding fathers smoked the drug, according to the pot-advocacy magazine High Times.

In the late eighteenth and early ninetenth centuries, the hemp plant that yields marijuana was grown widely in the New World for non-recreational purposes including fibers and oil.

George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison all cultivated hemp.

Madison, revered as the 'Father of the Constitution,' credited some of his ideas to mental clarity brought on by smoking hemp.

Presidents Zachary Taylor and Andrew Jackson both wrote letters that mentioned smoking marijuana with American troops during their time in battle.

James Monroe openly smoked hashish during his years as U.S. Ambassador to France and, according to one biographer, kept up the habit until he died at age 73.

And Thomas Jefferson, High Times claims, smuggled hemp seeds from China that were 'known for their potency.'
