Manchester United have agreed a £16million fee with Sporting Lisbon for defender Marcos Rojo.

Rojo, who touched down in Manchester on Tuesday evening and said joining United ‘feels like a dream’, is set to sign a four-year contract after passing a medical and agreeing personal terms.

Louis van Gaal made it a priority to sign a left-footed defender and stepped up his pursuit of Rojo, 24, following Saturday’s shock home defeat by Swansea.

During the World Cup semi-final, his top speed was quicker than Arjen Robben's 

In Portugal he was shown 27 yellow cards and five reds.

The deal was held up while United negotiated with Doyen Sports, the investment company that owned a percentage of Rojo’s economic rights, but on Tuesday night both clubs confirmed all parties have agreed terms.

He trained with Sporting on Tuesday but was not involved in the afternoon session as the Portuguese club and United finalised the move.

‘It feels like a dream to be a United player,’ said the Argentina international. ‘Leaving Sporting wasn’t easy but I am very proud of having the chance of working with Van Gaal.’

Rojo was so keen to force through his dream move to Manchester he upset the Sporting chairman Bruno de Carvalho, who said: 'There is no player bigger than the club. 

'I would not give up the honour, the club's history, for the attitudes of anyone.

'I give a piece of advice: don't use the press, be professional.'

Southampton also made an offer for Rojo earlier in the summer but once United's interest became apparent there was little chance of him moving to St Mary's. 

Nani, who joined United from Sporting for £17m in 2007, has returned to his old club on loan for the season as part of the deal.

He was greeted by a mob of supporters in the Portuguese capital, jubilant at his comeback.
