The patient claimed GP Peter Rubin was 'forceful and persistent' as he persuaded her to have sex

A mother broke down in tears today as she told a court of the moment she 'froze' as she was seduced by her doctor in his surgery on Christmas Eve.

The patient, in her 40s, claimed 53-year old married GP Peter Rubin was 'forceful and persistant' as he persuaded her to have sex after they were left alone together.

Afterwards he prescribed her with the morning-after pill saying: 'You should take this because it will be just my luck we will be in an anti-natal clinic.'

At a medical tribunal the woman - a mother of two - who had gone to the surgery to swap Christmas presents with Rubin ahead of a carol concert said: 'I didn’t go there for that sort of encounter. I went to exchange presents.

'He kept persisting and in the end he got his way. He had sex with me. I wasn’t participating. He was very strong and forceful.'

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the sexual encounter occurred during a five year 'improper relationship' Rubin had with the woman known as Patient A whose relationship with her partner was on the rocks.

The Manchester hearing was told he was doctor to Patient A’s family at the Woodlands Medical Centre in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

But trouble began when she began seeking treatment from him in July 2007 after suffering injuries in a horse-riding accident in which she fell out of the carriage of her pony and trap.

She said: 'I probably should have gone to A & E but I had to pick my child up from school and didn’t want any risk of going to hospital so got an appointment at the local surgery.

'I had mild concussion and severe bruises throughout my body. I saw Dr Rubin and I had time before the appointment to clean myself up.

'I purposely wore green khaki trousers
 I could lift up so I could show him my knee without having to lift 
anything up. I don’t like removing items and because it was a male 
doctor my instinct was that I would wear loose fitting clothing.

'I think my injuries were more severe than he realised. He asked to remove my trousers and I said ‘no’ and he respected that.'

Rubin later bumped into Patient A in a Tesco store and he gave her his personal mobile number 'in case she needed anything'.

The patient, in her 40s, claimed afterwards he prescribed her with the morning-after pill saying: 'You should take this because it will be just my luck we will be in an anti-natal clinic'

The next month she suffered whiplash injury in a car accident whilst she was taking an Italian girl who had been staying with her to Heathrow Airport.

The following day it was a birthday and she received a Prada phone in a parcel which was opened by her boyfriend.

She then went to see Rubin for a consultation about her injuries.

'My suspicions were the was phone was possibly from Dr Rubin,' said Patient A.

'I don’t celebrate birthdays and he had made comments about my phone that I couldn’t send photos with texts. Very few people knew it was my birthday.

'I wasn’t in a great position and felt quite rough so he gave me a hug.

'I didn’t return the hug and that’s when he made comments saying 'why doesn’t any of his patients wear nice underwear' which I found very strange.’

'I do clearly remember him getting out a bag which contained several SIM cards and he said take some of these.

'He said he was given a lot because he was a good client. I set the phone up and at some stage we must have exchanged numbers and that’s when the texts started.'

At Christmas 2007 Rubin bought her children a Wii console as a ‘reward’ for a son being brave during a blood test.

The pair had lunch together and later he told Patient A he was getting her a Christmas present.

She decided that she should buy him a present in return and she went to the surgery on Christmas Eve only to have intercourse with him.

Rubin then prescribed her with antiobiotics for a sore throat to give her an excuse for not being at the carol concert.

Patient A said: 'We went to the staff room an he said the cleaners were still cleaning then we went down to his room.

'I didn’t feel at all comfortable. We were the only two people in the surgery. There was low lighting and at that stage he made passes towards me. I froze.

'Afterwards he said he had to do something on the computer before I could go. I already had a prescription for antibiotics then he gave me the morning after pill.

'He later apologised for what happened on Xmas eve. He described himself as a bastard and said he always put himself first. ‘

'He told me he was close to leaving his wife and I was made to feel like the guilty part of it. I did in a certain way forgive him.

'He made about three of four visits to my home during the day time. I knew it was wrong. There was one time he was around the kitchen table and started fondling me and another occasion he wanted to see my bedroom and take me upstairs.

'That was when he hit his head on the beam which I had warned him about.

'Finally I was strong enough to say no. There were messages that go on to 2012. He would be silent then he would get in touch. One time was that he had a pony and trap to sell and wanted my help.

'In 2012 he passed me when I was on my horse and said something like ‘nice bum’ and I text back saying I had a problem with my knee and he gave me an appointment.

'I purposely wore loose trousers which would roll up so he could see my knee. I was with my daughter and the first thing he asked was that I got on the bed and took my trousers off which I refused to do.

'He insisted that he wanted them off so I started battling with him trying to pull them off and me keeping them on. My daughter asked if I was alright.

'I asked why he needed to take them down and he said he needed to feel my groin area. He was trying forcefully to get them down.

'In the end he stuck his hands down my trousers. I said he hadn’t even looked at my knee and he said he would give me antibiotics.'

Patient A later confided in one of her partners about what had happened and an investigation started.

It emerged Rubin altering records to say the emergency contraception had been ‘added by mistake’ to cover up his tracks.

He urged Patient A to withdraw her complaint because he feared being thrown out of his home by his wife.

Dr Rubin was suspended in November 2012.

It emerged he had admitted asking a 21-year-old female university student to kiss him and allowing her to do it during a consultation on June 17 2012 - but denies it was sexually motivated and insists it was ‘for a joke’.

The tribunal continues.
