Injured Manchester United defender Luke Shaw was spotted out for dinner with his friends on Saturday, just hours after his United team-mates failed to score against newly-promoted Burnley at Turf Moor.

The 19-year-old England international was spotted coming out of the swanky San Carlo restaurant at 11pm  - the same venue new signing Angel di Maria was seen at earlier in the week.

Shaw's fitness was questioned by new United manager Louis van Gaal on the club's pre-season tour of the USA, and he has been working hard to recover from a hamstring injury.

Van Gaal has since stuck up for the youngster though, especially after national team manager Roy Hodgson admitted he would be happy for the Dutchman to get Shaw fitter.

'Roy Hodgson cannot judge at this moment,' Van Gaal said. 'I have never seen him here at a United training session.

'In the United States I said to Luke, 'you came here and you were not fit'. I changed his programme and he did everything that he had to do to be fit.

'Now he is an example in the dressing room. He is training fantastically.'

United's start to the season has been less than impressive, with Van Gaal's side still yet to pick up a win after three matches. 

Shaw has been sidelined since picking up a training injury on 13 August, but is expected to make his competitive debut for the Red Devils after the international break.

The camera-shy Shaw, pictured below, was snapped heading from San Carlo to another bar in Manchester with a friend in tow.

Shaw, dressed similarly to his friend in a black jacket and high-top boots, held his hands in front of his face as he tried to avoid photographers.
