Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers felt his side had shown great resilience to emerge triumphant from a crazy Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough.

The third-round encounter at Anfield saw the teams level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and 2-2 after extra-time, with the Sky Bet Championship visitors, who hit the post near the end of normal time, netting their second equaliser in the dying seconds.

An epic penalty shoot-out followed - believed to be the longest in the competition's history - which the hosts eventually won 14-13.

And Rodgers said afterwards: 'It was a real good night for us.

'I was obviously pleased to get through, and that experience, even though it was a long night for everyone, was great for our young players.

'It is good to win no matter how you do it. We played okay in the game and didn't create a great deal to be honest, but we showed good perseverance to keep going.

'As it is at the moment, we made too many mistakes and got punished for that in the game.

'But the players showed great resilience and mentality to keep going and at the end, when it was needed, they showed wonderful composure - some of our young players stepping up to take the penalties.'

Brendan Rodgers praised his side's perseverance and resilience, despite the holes in his defence

In a Liverpool side showing seven changes from Saturday's 3-1 Barclays Premier League loss at West Ham, 17-year-old local lad Jordan Rossiter made a swift impact on his senior debut, the midfielder coolly slotting in the opening goal of the game in the 10th minute.

There were also notable contributions from 20-year-old forward Suso, scorer of the Reds' second, and fellow substitute Jordan Williams, a 18-year-old midfielder and another debutant, who converted in the shootout.

Rodgers said: 'Tonight was a good night for our young players.

Mario Balotelli took two penalties in the shootout, going left both times and scored each

'Young Jordan Rossiter at 17 years of age - he could walk to Anfield, he lives just around the corner, and I was delighted for him. He got the opportunity and showed a wonderful finish, and composure to get that finish.

'I was also impressed with young Jordan Williams - he came on and showed real good stature and composure in the game. He is a wonderful footballer and a young player who is developing well.

'And young Suso hasn't had a lot of game time at all, but he has kept working and I thought he was really bright for us when he came on, and took his goal really well.

Asked what the future held for Rossiter and Williams, Rodgers said: 'Opportunity - and I think that is the biggest thing a young player can want.

'I think all the young players and coaches in the academy will look at that tonight, and they know anyway through my work that I will always look to them.

'My job is to grow the top-class young talents, not just buy them in. We want to grow them, or there is no point having our youth academy.

'Tonight is a great night for them and a step towards them playing for the first-team regularly, hopefully.'

Rodgers' was also pleased with Suso's performance, the Spaniard scored Liverpool's second goal
