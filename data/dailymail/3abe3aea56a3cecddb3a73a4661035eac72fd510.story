Ebola screening begins today at Gatwick Airport, Public Health England have confirmed. 

It will start in North Terminal, then checks will begin at South Terminal from tomorrow, followed by St Pancras (Eurostar) later this week, a spokesman said.

'Screening is being undertaken to help ensure individuals arriving from high-risk areas know what to do if they start feeling ill, and can receive expert advice immediately,' he continued.

Ebola screening began at Heathrow Airport for passengers coming from West Africa last week

He added: 'This expands the screening initiated at Heathrow last week, which is going well. Manchester and Birmingham airports will follow in the coming weeks.

'We are also providing all general practices, emergency departments, and pharmacies in England with awareness posters from this week. 

'Public Health England will continue to consider other appropriate additional measures.'

Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at PHE, said: 'Anyone who is well but may have been at increased risk of contact with the Ebola virus will be given printed information and a PHE contact number to call in case they develop symptoms.

'People infected with Ebola can only spread the virus to other people once they have developed symptoms, such as a fever. 

'Even if someone has symptoms, the virus is only transmitted by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person.

'It’s important to remember this is just one part of the screening process. PHE is also working with the international community and local health authorities to ensure robust exit screening remains in place at airports in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, which will pick up anyone who is symptomatic before they leave these countries.

'Although no system can completely prevent a case of Ebola coming into the UK, enhanced screening in high volume ports of entry will ensure that individuals at risk know exactly what to do if they start feeling ill, and can receive the expert advice they need immediately.

'Overall the risk of Ebola in the UK remains low, and we have a world-class domestic health system that is ready to respond if we do see a case in the UK.'

Passengers arriving from Britain from high-risk areas are being subject to screening at Heathrow. 

They are being asked to complete a questionnaire asking about their current health and where they have come from.

As well as personal details, including name, nationality, address in UK and phone number they have been asked: 

The screening is taking place for passengers that Border Force officers identify as having travelled from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Passengers will have their temperature taken and complete a questionnaire asking about their current health, recent travel history and whether they might be at potential risk through contact with Ebola patients.

Based on the information provided and their temperature, passengers will either be given advice and allowed to continue their journey, or undergo a clinical assessment by PHE staff and if necessary be taken to hospital for further tests.

The UK and the US have both introduced screening measures in response to the threat from Ebola, which has killed more than 4,500 people in West Africa.

It is believed that new screening procedures at Gatwick airport will affect passengers on about seven flights throughout the day.

The Department of Health estimates that 85 per cent of all arrivals to the UK from affected countries will come through Heathrow airport, where testing began last week.

The testing descended into chaos on its first day however, after people flying to the UK from high risk countries revealed the checks are not compulsory.

But travellers at Terminal 1 this morning said the system is a 'complete joke' because they were either not checked at all, told it was optional or had to seek out medical staff themselves.

Avoid direct contact with sick patients as the virus is spread through contaminated body fluids

Wear goggles to protect eyes

Clothing and clinical waste should be incinerated and any medical equipment that needs to be kept should be decontaminated

People who recover from Ebola should abstain from sex or use condoms for three months 

After the complaints the Department of Health confirmed that screening travellers at major entry points into UK is not mandatory unless they 'show symptoms of the virus'.

This was despite warnings from the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said that it was essential for airline passengers from West Africa to be checked for symptoms 'to make our country safe' and warned the epidemic could be as deadly as Aids.

Mr Hunt also warned Britain should expect up to ten cases by Christmas as screening of passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where 4,000 have died from Ebola, started at Heathrow.
