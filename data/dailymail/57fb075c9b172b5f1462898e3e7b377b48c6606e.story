The U.S. Coast Guard has been forced to use ice-cutting vessels to try and keep the shipping channels open, as the big freeze has frozen over huge lanes between America and Canada.

As the nation struggles to function in spite of the plunging temperatures caused by a 'polar vortex' that has led to the coldest morning in decades, heavy ships that can break chunks of ice are working around the clock to clear major shipping routes and ensure freighters don't get stuck in the thick ice.

The ice cutters make clear paths through St. Mary’s River and the Soo Locks as blocks of ice forms in the Great Lakes, where ice can form up to a foot thick in the waterways.

Four of the gigantic vessels have been working around the clock to keep the shipping lanes open for freighters that connect the river paths to deliver goods between the Midwest and the East Coast, ABC reported.

The turbulent weather conditions have been caused by a 'polar vortex' of frigid arctic air, which is predicted to bring record-breaking cold temperatures to the East and Northeast today.

Forecasters predict that some 187 million people have now felt the effects of the ‘vortex’, with much of the country suffering a historic freeze that closed schools and businesses on Monday.

But more than 70 daily record lows are predicted to fall by the wayside today from the Deep South to the Northeast and Midwest, reports Weather.com.

Big chill: The polar vortex has wreaked havoc across the nation and grounded flights, blocked roads and even frozen up the shipping channels

Today's morning lows will  plummet into the 20s below zero over much of the Upper Mississippi Valley, teens below zero in much of the western Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, and below zero as far south as the southern Appalachians.

Particularly notable will be the cold in the Ohio Valley on Tuesday morning. For example, Toledo, Ohio may have its coldest morning in almost 20 years (Jan. 18-19, 1994), and may be within five degrees of its all-time record of -20 set on Jan. 21, 1984.

Flights, trains and bus transportation can again expect disruptions as even parts of the country used to fending off hypothermia and frostbite are having  to take extra precautions as temperatures and wind chills approach record levels.

The frigid air that virtually shut down major cities and tiny towns in the Midwest will spread to the South and East.

Subzero temperatures broke records in Chicago, while Indiana residents dealt with inches of snow and numerous power outages.

The coldest temperature in Chicago is a frigid 16 below zero with a wind chill factor of negative 50 in some parts - and the freeze shows no sign of abating

'The cold is the real killer here,'Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard says in asking schools and businesses to close for a second straight day.

The shipping lanes weren't the only form of transportation disrupted by the historic freeze.

There also were widespread delays and cancellations in ground transportation - including Amtrak, buses and commuter trains.

Officials with Chicago's commuter rail, Metra, said there were multiple accidents, including one in which 14 passengers reported injuries - and six were taken to the hospital with minor injuries - after a train hit a 'bumping post' at a downtown station.

Weather-related engine problems forced an Amtrak train carrying 200 passengers to stop for more than 8 1/2 hours in southwestern Michigan before arriving early Monday morning in Chicago.

And the Southern Illinois men's basketball team spent the night on a church floor in central Illinois after their bus got stuck in a snowdrift on Interstate 57 following Sunday's storm.

Drivers didn't fare much better. A state emergency official said nearly 400 vehicles - including six semis - were stuck for several hours overnight on Sunday along a snowy stretch of interstate in southern Illinois.
