TWO British couples saw their Spanish homes razed to the ground  after a near decade-long fight to save them.

Regional government officials ended the struggle by the OAPs to save their dream retirement villas and sent in bulldozers to flatten them.

British expats and more than a dozen local mayors protested by reading out a joint manifesto criticising the move before police cordoned off the area so the demolition workmen could go in.

Homeowners Peter and Margaret Hegarty and Frank and Janet Doel have returned to the UK and were not present to see their £140,000 investments reduced to rubble.

The dream retirement homes of Peter and Margaret Hegarty and Frank and Janet Doel were bulldozed after a decade long struggle to save them

Peter and Margaret Hegarty said their dream retirement home was 'snatched away' 

Retired car factory worker Mrs Hegarty, 71, originally from Glasgow but now living in Winchburgh, west Lothian, with her Northamptonshire-born husband said: 'We put more than 35 years' worth of savings into that house.

'I am disgusted at what's happened.'

The couple bought their three-bedroom home in good faith in 2005 with the help of former steel worker Mr Hegarty's redundancy payment - believing it had been built legally - but were duped by the then-mayor Pedro Llamas and property developer Francisco Pedrosa.

In 2012 a court found the former mayor guilty of falsifying documents and sentenced him to two years in jail, suspended because it was his first offence.

He and the developer were ordered to pay compensation to the Hegartys, the Doels and two British couples whose neighbouring homes have already been demolished - but they declared themselves bankrupt and have yet to pay a penny.

Graffiti exposing the injustice suffered by the Brits appeared overnight on the two properties near the pretty village of Cantoria, south east Spain, which were ransacked by vandals when the Hegartys and their neighbours moved out.

Graffiti was scrawled on the properties before they were demolished saying 'punish the guilty, not the victims'

The Brits' lawyer was told on Monday afternoon that the appeal to save the villas had been thrown out

One scrawl said in Spanish: 'Punish the guilty, not the victims.' Another, blaming the local Junta de Andalucia regional government for the fiasco, said in Spanish 'Junta culpable' - English for 'Junta, guilty.' The demolition followed the failure of an eleventh-hour appeal to save the properties on humanitarian grounds.

The Brits' lawyer Alejandro Navarro was told on Monday afternoon the appeal had been thrown out.

Mrs Hegarty said: 'We actually went out this morning because we didn't want to be sitting around thinking about it all.

'What's happened makes me so angry. We've had our dream retirement snatched away from us through no fault of our own and we've yet to see a penny in compensation.

'We live in hope we'll get some money back one day but I'm very doubtful it will ever happen.'

 Maura Hillen, the chairman of campaign group AUAN which is fighting to reclassify thousands of illegally-built properties around southern Spain, was among the expats who witnessed the demolition.

It was supposed to start at midday local time but began an hour late.

AUAN says there is an estimated 300,000 illegally built homes in southern Spain, including some 5,000 around the Almanzora valley which includes the small village of Cantoria.

She said: 'I came to record what was going on and show the world what the Junta de Andalucia is doing to foreign investors in the area.

'If this was my house being razed to the ground, I'd find it unbearable.

'The Hegartys and the Doels are going to be devastated when they see what's happened.

'These couples have had nearly 10 years of stress, anguish and legal fees to deal with and they've received nothing by way of compensation.

'The state machinery has proved relentless against them when it should have been concerned with the people that have done wrong, not the victims.' The Junta de Andalucia promised there would be backing down in a statement released at the weekend.

A spokesman said: 'The Cantoria houses will be demolished in compliance with a sentence passed by the Provincial Court.

'The Junta has no obligation to compensate the owners, since no right to compensation has been recognised.

'This right to compensation would be granted if the illegal buildings had had a licence which had later been declared void.

'This is not the case of the homes in Cantoria.' The British Embassy in Madrid estimates 4,000 Brits are fighting to save their homes in Spain.

The first Brits to see their home demolished where Helen and Len Prior. Their villa in Vera, Almeria, was demolished in 2008 and they are still living in a garage while they await compensation.

The Hegartys' neighbours in Cantoria, John and Jan Brooks, from Taunton, Somerset, had their property flattened last year.

Their neighbours Clive and Gillian Davies also suffered the same fate.
