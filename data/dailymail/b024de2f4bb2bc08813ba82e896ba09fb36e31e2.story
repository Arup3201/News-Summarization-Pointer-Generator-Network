Researchers say it is possible to repair a chronically diseased liver by forcing mature liver cells to 'go back in time' to a stem cell-like state.

Switching off a liver-growth pathway in mature cells generates high levels of dedifferentiation, which means the cells can revert back to an unspecialized state and regenerate a diseased liver.

The breakthrough, published in the journal Cell, could pave the way for liver cell transplants to cure genetic liver disorders.

Cell transition: Scientists say when the Hippo pathway is inactivated, mature liver cells revert back to a stem cell-like state. This picture shows a group of cells transitioning from a mature cell type (green) to a stem cell type (red). White cells are the cells where Hippo is being inactivated

Harvard Stem Cell Institute scientists at Boston Children's Hospital made the discovery while investigating whether a biochemical cascade called Hippo, which 
controls how big the liver grows, also affects cell fate.Â 

Switching off the 
Hippo-signaling pathway in mature liver cells means they become
 stem-cell like again, allowing them to give rise to functional 
progenitor cells that can regenerate a diseased liver.

'I think this study highlights the 
tremendous plasticity of mature liver cells,' research lead Fernando Camargo said, according to Science Daily.

'It's not that you have a very small population of 
cells that can be recruited to an injury; almost 80 percent of 
hepatocytes [liver cells] can undergo this cell fate change.'

Camargo's team studied mice born with a genetic liver disease. They cultured healthy liver progenitor cells and transplanted them into the diseased mice.

Over about four months, the transplanted liver cells engrafted and the animals' condition improved.

'People have been trying to use liver cell transplants for metabolic diseases since the early 90s, but because of the source of cells - discarded livers-- they were unsuccessful,' Camargo said.

'With this unlimited source of cells from a patient, we think that perhaps it's time to think again about doing hepatocyte or progenitor cell transplants in the context of liver genetic disorders.'

They found that switching off the pathway in mature liver cells makes them stem cells again

A stem cell is an unspecialized cell that gives rise to specialized cells

These stem cells can quickly dedifferentiate to regenerate a diseased liver
