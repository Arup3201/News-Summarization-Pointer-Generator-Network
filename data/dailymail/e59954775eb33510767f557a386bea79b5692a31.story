Identical triplets born to a Canadian couple three months ago have been diagnosed with the same, extremely rare form of eye cancer.

Thomas, Mason and Luke Low are all suffering from retinoblastoma, a cancer so rare there are only about 20 cases diagnosed in Canada every year.

Their parents, Richard and Leslie Low, noticed that one of the babies had an odd-shaped pupil, and following testing, were told that each of their tiny sons had retinoblastoma.

The Lows had moved Edmonton for Richard Low's medical residency with their two-year-old son Benson when they were given the news that Leslie was carrying not one but three babies.

The chance of conceiving identical triplets naturally is about one in a million, and Richard and Leslie Low were surprised but excited about the prospect of being parents to triplets.

A few months after the triplets were born, Richard noticed a strange change in Mason's eye.

'I noticed Mason had an odd pupil like a tear drop, I thought it was a little odd,' he told the Global News.

'I thought about it and talked to my friend who is an eye doctor, and he told me to take a picture with the flash and look for red reflex, and there was no red reflex, it was white.'

The Lows took Mason to a specialist who diagnosed retinoblastoma, a rare cancer that's most common in young children.

The doctor then examined Luke and Thomas and gave the Lows the devastating news that they, too, had the condition.

It turns out that the shape of Mason's pupil had nothing to do with the retinoblastoma, but were it not for Richard Low's curiosity, the cancer may have advanced to a much more dangerous stage before the boys were diagnosed.

'We obviously are devastated,' one of the Lows wrote on the family blog. 'My heart nearly shattered to pieces when I heard the news, but I am trying to put myself back together. There's no time to be brokenhearted when you have four beautiful boys to care for.'

The family realizes their uniquely unlucky situation.

On their blog they wrote: 'Chances of marrying while at BYU [Brigham Young University], 1/3. Chances of having a boy, 1/2. Chances of having four boys in a row, 1/16. Chances of spontaneous identical triplets (no in vitro), 1/1,000,000. Chances of triplets having retinoblastoma, unheard of [sic]."

The condition is the result of a gene mutation that occurred before the egg split into three, resulting in all three boys having retinoblastoma.

The family flew to Toronto for treatment, where they were given individual diagnoses for each baby.

The Lows were told that Luke had 10 tumors scattered in both eyes, but located in the peripheral areas, not causing any central visual impairment. The tumors were treated with a laser.

Mason had one main tumor in his left eye, along with smaller cancer cells that could develop into a tumor.

He has been treated with localized chemotherapy and laser treatment to diminish the large tumor and prevent it growing any further.

Recovering: Tiny Thomas Low after surgery to remove his eye

Doctors are hoping to save his left eye with systemic chemotherapy, which will be performed when he is slightly older.

Thomas, who had the most serious case of the three, had a large central tumor that was too big to treat with laser or chemotherapy injection.

The Lows had to make a quick decision to either try systemic chemotherapy, a risky treatment for a baby who weighs barely nine pounds, or to remove Thomas's right eye.

Systemic chemo gave them only a 50 per cent chance of saving the eye, but could have resulted in hearing loss, kidney failure or brain cancer.

'All to save an eye that wouldnâ€™t see,' Richard Lows said. 'We decided to just focus on his good eye.'

The Lows opted to have Thomas's right eye removed, which will help to strengthen his left into a 'super-eye.'

Since his surgery last Friday, Thomas has recovered well. He has been fitted with a temporary prosthetic eye that will be exchanged for a more permanent one when he's older.

'You know, we have prayed for a miracle, and a miracle did happen,' Leslie Low wrote on the family blog.

'All babies have at least one really good eye. Prayers truly are being answered.'

All three babies will need to be constantly monitored - every two weeks - for new tumors until the retina stops growing at around age two.
