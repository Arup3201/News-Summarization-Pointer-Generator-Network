Jessica Harper at court today. The former head of online security has admitted stealing £2.4m

A former Lloyds boss who was in charge of the bank's online security has admitted stealing £2.4million from under her bosses' noses.

Jessica Harper abused her position at Lloyds Banking Group over a four-year period between 2007 and 2011.

The former head of fraud and security for online digital banking submitted false invoices to claim £2,463,750.88 before laundering part of the proceeds buying property for her family.

It is thought cash was also spent on improvements to a property in the south of France. 

Harper was arrested by the Met’s economic and specialist crime unit following a tip-off

Dressed in a black dress and cream 
cardigan, 50-year-old, from Croydon, south London, spoke only to confirm her name and plead guilty to 
charges of fraud and money laundering in a 10 minute hearing at 
Southwark Crown Court.

She admitted a single charge of fraud by abuse of position by submitting false invoices to claim payments totalling £2,463,750.

She also admitted a single charge of transferring criminal property, the money, which she had defrauded from her employers.

Harper is no longer an employee of the bank, which is 41 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

Antony Swift, prosecuting, described Harper's crime as 'a very simple fraud' and said she 
had already repaid £300,000 and was in the process of selling her house 
for around £700,000.

He added: 'That will be some £1 million out of £2.5 million that's gone missing.'

Carol Hawley, defending, said as well as selling her home, Harper had also sold shares and cashed in her pension to repay 
‘significant sums of money’.

She told the court: 'She 
appreciates the seriousness and has made full admissions in interview. 
She understands perfectly well on the next occasion she will be facing 
imprisonment of some length.

'There are some matters to attend to,
not least she is in the process of taking steps to repay significant 
sums of the money that has been taken and has already cashed in her 
pension and various other shares.

'More
significant is her property, on the market - exchange in relation to 
that property is due to take place today. Completion will be in the 
period of seven to 10 days.

'As a result of that she will be able to offer something in the order of £700,000.'

Prosecutor David Levy said at an 
earlier hearing: ‘This lady was head of fraud and security for digital 
banking for Lloyds Banking Group.

‘The Crown say she abused her position to the extent of over £2.4m obtained by her.

‘Part
of the proceeds were paid by her to her family to enable them to 
purchase property, and other monies were dissipated in a variety of ways
for personal costs and use.’

‘This is a serious and complex fraud, the amount of money involved is over £2m, and there is breach of trust as well.’

Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith bailed Harper, with conditions, ahead of sentence on September 21.

He said: 'The Crown tell me she has 
co-operated and is unlikely to flee. In those circumstances I can grant 
her bail on condition of residence at her present home address.

'And there will be a curfew of 9pm to seven in the morning.'

The former £70,000 a year digital banking security chief is also banned from applying for international travel documents, having previously handed her passport over to police.

Harper, a keen charity worker and Rotarian, is separated from her husband John and lives with her brother Gareth Tyrrell at her £700,000 semi-detached Edwardian house in South Croydon.

She also owns a second home in France where her mother Helen lives.

Mr Swift, prosecuting, said he had previously raised concerns over Harper being bailed following her arrest: ‘There was some concern, as she has a mother in France and some of the money had gone to her mother and a property over there, that she may leave the jurisdiction.’

He added: ‘The Crown’s view is that she has been on bail throughout. She admitted her guilt within about ten minutes of her first interview.

‘When she was re-interviewed she admitted her guilt. She did not admit her guilt at the Magistrates’ court but an indication was given that she would plead guilty.’

Sue Patten, head of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, Central Fraud Division, said: 'Jessica Harper has 
today been convicted of the type of crime the bank employed her to 
combat.

'The evidence in the case was clear 
and left Harper with little choice but to plead guilty. In doing so, she
has admitted to a huge breach of trust against her former employer.

'Harper was expected to safeguard the
financial interests of the bank. Instead, she submitted false invoices 
totalling more that £2.4 million over a period of four years.

'She has also pleaded guilty to laundering the funds of the fraud.'

Harper admitted fraud by abuse of 
position between December 2007 and December 2011 and one count of 
concealing, disguising, converting, transferring, or removing criminal 
property between February 2008 and April 2011.
