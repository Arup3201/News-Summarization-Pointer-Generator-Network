Britain is becoming a more religious country, historian Simon Schama, pictured has said

Britain is becoming a more religious country, historian Simon Schama has said.

After years being relegated to the sidelines, religion has once again become part of mainstream life, he told Radio Times.

The 69-year-old whose most recent documentary was The Story Of The Jews, said: ‘My generation grew up thinking that religion was completely marginal to British life, which, as for the rest of the world, has been proved more and more wrong.

‘We were arrogantly isolated from that, thinking religion was just an ornamental part of Britishness.

‘Now
 look at the success of the Alpha Evangelicals, how important 
Christianity has been to the community of West Indians, the huge place 
of Islam. Britain is becoming a more religious place, not less.’

Schama
 said that throughout his career he had been amazed at the important 
role faith played. Without it, he said, ‘there would have been no wars 
in Scotland and massacres in Ireland’.
