The number of ‘super-commuter’ Britons who take 90 minutes to get to work has soared by 50 per cent in the last five years, according to a new report.

The study shows the average UK worker spends 41 minutes commuting every day.

But the number spending a total of three hours or more travelling has risen to 1.84million - or nine per cent of the workforce.

According to the results, accountants have the longest average daily commute – 75.6 minutes – followed by IT workers at 65.6 minutes.

The number of Britons spending at least three hours a day on their work commute has risen by 50 per cent

By contrast, people working in the car industry only travel for an average of 22 minutes.

They are followed by retailers (31.8 minutes), leisure workers (32.3 minutes), estate agents (36.4 minutes) and teachers (36.9 minutes).

Employees working in the leisure industry have the shortest distance to travel, an average of 12.6 miles, compared to IT workers with a 38.5-mile journey.

The report, by recruitment firm Randstad, found that the car is Britain’s most popular method of transport to and from the office – accounting for more than half of work-related journeys.

And around one in ten people will take the train, but only one in 40 cycles to work.

Mark Bull, the UK chief executive of 
Randstad, said : ‘The central tenet of the commuting life is that you 
travel away from the workplace.

‘You
 do this until you reach an area where you can afford to buy a house 
that meets your standards. In this equation you’re essentially trading 
miles for square feet.

The car is still the most popular method of getting to work, accounting for half of all journeys

‘Three hours is no longer extraordinary. Commuters travel across counties the way that they used to travel across neighbourhoods.’

And despite the tough economic conditions, British commuters are only spending marginally less time (2.3%) on the move than they were before the downturn began to take hold. For back in 2008, the average British commute took a total of 42 minutes each day.

The average total daily commuting distance has dropped from 18.5 miles in 2008 to 16.7 miles - a fall of 10 per cent - as people live slightly closer to their workplaces.

But the report notes: ‘The fact commuting times have remained broadly the same suggests commuters are managing their commutes and using slower - possibly cheaper - modes of transport than they were before the downturn.’
