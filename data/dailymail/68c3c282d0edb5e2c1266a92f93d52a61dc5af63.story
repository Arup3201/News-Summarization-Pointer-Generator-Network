A famous Thai temple has apologised after finding itself at the centre of an international row for reportedly banning Chinese tourists from its new toilet.

The tourists were said to have disgusted other visitors to Wat Rong Khun – The White Temple – by urinating on walls and defecating on the floor.

The complaints were believed to have prompted a decision by the temple’s owner that new toilet facilities due to open would be made unavailable for Chinese tourists, according to People’s Daily.

But, responding to online criticism, owner Chalermchai Kositpipat – who stressed he is ‘three quarters Chinese but cannot speak the language’ – said everyone would be allowed to use the new facilities.

Wat Rong Khun, one of the most popular tourist spots for Chinese tourists in Thailand, is situated in Chiang Rai.

It is better known as The White Temple due to its stunning all-white exteriors.

And, keen to remain whiter-than-white, the temple had become concerned with reports that foul messes left behind by a minority of guests had made it difficult for others to use the toilets.

Chalermchai Kositpipat said the temple originally had two bathrooms and had recently built a third one about 200 metres away from its popular 'golden toilet', reported China Daily.

All tourists are now free to use any of the bathrooms, continued the report.

Embarrassed Chalermchai Kositpipat attempted to deflect criticism by pointing out he has three-quarters Chinese blood.

His father originally comes from Guangdong and his mother is Thai-Chinese. Although he can’t speak Chinese, he remembers the Chinese name his father has given him, which reads Qi Longcai.

'I don’t have any intention to look down upon Chinese,' said the owner. ‘As Chinese, I hope we can all strive to ensure that we travel with manners.'

The temple's owner has invested huge sums of his money into renovations but does not charge entry fees

The temple was nearly demolished when it was affected by an earthquake in May 2014 

Chalermchai Kositpipat designs the temple himself - and the state-of-the-art bathrooms are a tourist attraction in their own right.

While the temple closed its bathrooms temporarily to Chinese tourists on February 3, it has been opened since.

The ‘White Temple incident’, as it was dubbed by Chinese media, caught the attention of government officials as well as the press in both China and Thailand.

Governmental functions such as The Ministry of Tourism and Sports have stressed repetitively that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. 

Chinese-language pamphlets and guidebooks are available in many tourist attractions, such as The Grand Palace.

The news also sparked debate within Thailand. According to People’s Daily, some Thai netizens expressed anger towards the rude behaviour of Chinese tourists, while others thought they should keep a tolerant mind.

Li Liangcheng, the Minister of Thailand-China Tourism Association, said the arrival of Chinese tourists has brought considerable income and that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. Mr Li also encouraged Chinese tourists to understand the local customs and laws.
