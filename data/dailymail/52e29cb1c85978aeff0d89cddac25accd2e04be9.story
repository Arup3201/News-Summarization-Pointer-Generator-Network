A retired teacher died from massive internal injuries after being crushed between two horses as she was getting ready for a hunt, an inquest heard.

Mother-of-two Rosemary Turnbull, from Marden, Kent, suffered multiple injuries to her chest and heart as she led the animals ahead of a hunting pack in November last year.

A coroner heard the horses often became 'spooked' by the dogs and may have tried to escape from the 62-year-old.

Her friend of 20 years, Jane Tipples, said she heard a squeal and turned to see Mrs Turnbull clutching her stomach.

The retired primary school teacher then collapsed at the farm in Tonbridge, Kent, before witnesses called 999.

Paramedics and an air ambulance crew spent 40 minutes trying to save her, but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her devastated husband John, 62, said the family would never know exactly what happened but paid tribute to his late wife.

Mr Turnbull, from Marden, Kent, said: 'It has been extremely difficult to come to terms with such a sudden loss of someone I have spent 36 years with.

'Rosemary was exceptionally loved by myself and our children Oliver and Joanna.'

Mrs Turnbull retired in 2013, and her husband added she was loved by her pupils.

He added: 'She was hugely popular and more than 200 people attended her funeral.'

Coroner Patricia Harding adjourned the inquest in Maidstone to a later date to get further information from emergency services.
