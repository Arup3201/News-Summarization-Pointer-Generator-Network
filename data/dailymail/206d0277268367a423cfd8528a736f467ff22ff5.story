Craning your neck up to admire the ornate roofs of churches and cathedrals can be back-breaking work.

But one photographer has made the experience a whole lot easier by creating panoramic shots that showcase the rich religious architecture across the world.

Richard Silver, from Brooklyn, New York, travels around the world taking stunning photos since he gave up his job as a stockbroker and pursued the hobby full-time.

He has become an expert creating the awe-inspiring photos which features houses of worship including place such as New York, Mexico City, Budapest, Krakow, Cape Town and Goa.

Mr Silver told MailOnline that he first came up with the idea after being inspired by buildings in his home city.

'The first time I photographed a church using my Vertical Panorama technique was in New York City,' he says.

'New York is filled with a number of iconic buildings to photograph but I decided to walk into and look at its local churches. When traveling the world I always walk into and seek out the churches when I am there, why not do it at home?

To create them he ensures that he finds the right spot to capture the building in all its glory for the 180 degree shot. Right: Augustiner Church Vienna

'Being fascinated with the 
amount of work taken to decorate the ceilings of a church I came up with
 the notion to try and capture the ceiling photographically. It took me a
 few tries to figure out mechanically how to take the shots but now I 
have it down to a science.'

To create them Mr Silver ensures that he finds the right spot to capture the building in all its glory for the 180 degree shot.

It takes between six and 10 photographs to complete the masterpiece, which he expertly blends together in his studio using Photoshop.

A programme called Lightroom allows him to bring out the vivid colours and detail of the stained glass windows. 

Mr Silver, who is not religious, often
 has to battle churchgoers and tourists in his quest to make sure the 
photos are not packed full of people.

He says his favourite place to photograph was the Serbian Orthodox church in New York.

'I pass by this amazing church almost every day and it is only open on Sunday's for worship,' he explained.

'The
 friar actually opened up the church just for me to photograph during 
the week. I felt honored to be able to photograph such a wonderful piece
 of architecture. I ended up printing the photos out for him to keep in 
his office.'

Mr Silver 
views the project as ongoing saying: 'There are cities I have been to 
already that I wish I would have figured this method of photographing 
out before I went. I am looking to go back to Rome and London and shoot 
there as the churches are so colorful and exquisitely decorated. My goal
 is to do a book of my work.'
