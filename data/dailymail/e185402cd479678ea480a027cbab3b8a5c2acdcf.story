A seven foot alligator has been confiscated and its owner faces animal cruelty charges after it was found caged in a plastic box in an Ohio basement.

Vets say that the gator is severely undernourished, has damaged teeth and bone disease from a lack of sunlight after being kept locked away in the basement of the house for 15 years.

The reptile was discovered after a video emerged on Facebook of it being taunted by teenagers.

Freed: The alligator is believed to have been kept in a plastic tub in the basement for around 15 years

Poor condition: Vets say that the alligator is missing several teeth and is severely malnourished

The footage showed a young man laughing as he throws beer on the alligator which reacts by biting the plastic box it was kept in.

According to the Humane Society of Greater Dayton which seized the animal, the youngsters filmed taunting the gator may also face cruelty charges.

Tim Harrison, director of Outreach For Animals, a group which rescues exotic animals in Ohio, said that rumours that there was an alligator in the basement of the house had been circulating for more than two years.

But authorities could not enter the property without any evidence. That evidence came in the form of the Facebook clip.

It is believed that the owner of the alligator would leave the door to his basement open and allow pupils from a local high school to come in and see the alligator even when he wasn't there. It is believed that he was out when the Facebook video was shot.

According to Mr Harrison, the reptile has weakened and missing teeth and there were bite marks all over the concrete wall next to the alligator's tub indicating that it had repeateadly jerked its head from previous taunts.

As well as its damaged teeth, the alligator is severely undernourished - it should be around 10 ft long instead of seven.

Because it has been kept in the basement for so long, it is also severely lacking in vitamin D.

Mr Harrison told SFGate: 'When we brought him out in to the sun, he actually just closed his eyes for a long time. It was really sad.'

The alligator will be moved to a refuge in Florida and kept in a specially made outdoor area.

President of the Humane Society of Greater Dayton warned others against keeping exotic animals as pets.

He told WDTN.com: 'These are not pets you would take on a walk like you would a dog.'
