Thousands of JetBlue passengers faced lengthy delays following 'a widespread system outage' on Monday.

Lines snaked around airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Logan International in Boston and airports in Tampa and Orlando, following the early-morning outage.

The issue meant passengers were unable to check in their bags and some had to wait for  handwritten boarding passes, NBC News reported.

The company says it has now resolved the problem but that there will be residual delays throughout the morning.

Frustrating: JetBlue customers shared photos of the massive queues at airports across the East Coast on Monday morning after the company suffered a massive system outage

Anger: One passenger tweeted her annoyance at the delays at LaGuardia Airport in New York City

Apologies: The airline told passengers about the problem over Twitter but has now resolved the issue

It had revealed the issue on Twitter after customers complained about the delayed flights.

'We apologize,' JetBlue tweeted. 'There is a system outage. We're working to get everything up and running as quickly as we can.'

The issue was resolved around 6.15am, the company said. 

'It looks like our system is coming back,' it tweeted to one customer shortly before 6.30am. 'We should have you on your way shortly.'

It said that no flights would be canceled but that some would be held so that passengers would make their planes. WBZ reported that some people had reported missing their flights because of long security lines.

Matt Cleinman, who was supposed to take off from Boston at 6.20am for Pittsburgh, was still waiting to check in at 7am.

Stuck: Another customer traveling from Boston shared his ordeal online before the system was fixed

Bad start to the week: Customers waited in lines for as long as 90 minutes to get boarding passes

Delays: The system has now been fixed but delays remain at airports, including in Boston and New York

'I'd expect major delays to ripple through their day,' he told NBC, saying lines were 'crazy'.

Others took to Twitter to share images of the lines and to express their annoyance.

'#JetBlue manually checking in passengers at DCA,' said Ryan Ludick, who was waiting at Reagan National Airport in Virginia. 'Over an hour standing on line with no progress.'

'All @JetBlue systems down. No check in possible. at kiosk, on phone, or at desk. Not boarding any flights systemwide, either. Ouch,' another traveler in Boston tweeted. 

'Lines wrap around Logan airport due to Jet Blues computer problems,' Susie Steimle of WBZ in Boston tweeted at 7am. 'Most of these people have been waiting 1.5 hrs.' 

Charlie Field, also in Boston, said the terminal was 'jammed' but noted that the airline's employees were 'keeping people calm and informed'.
