Smokers' advocates have railed against graphic new public health warnings showing a father lighting a hand-rolled cigarette full of rotting flesh.

Public Health England (PHE) today launches its new shock campaign alongside an expert review of the role of smoking in the progressive decline of the body's major systems.

Proclaiming loudly that 'every cigarette rots you from the inside out', the adverts will begin to appear on digital and print billboards across the country, and also on video.

So rotten: Public Health England (PHE) today launches its new shock anti-smoking campaign alongside an expert review of the role of smoking in the progressive decline of the body's major systems

But smokers' rights group Forest called the campaign 'poisonous' and accused PHE of making 'exaggerated claims'.

Urging officials to 'engage directly with consumers' rather than use shock tactics, Forest chief executive Simon Clark said 'there can't be a sane adult in the United Kingdom who isn't well aware of the health risks of smoking.'

PHE's campaign comes as the Government's Chief Medical Officer warned the idea some people have that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong.

Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘rot’ the body from the inside.

She said that contrary to popular belief that roll-ups are natural and less dangerous, the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals.

Health officials are concerned that roll-ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes.

Smoking: Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years

Figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them, up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990.

But 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful, according to a survey of 627 individuals.

Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘While many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs, they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘rotting’ it from the inside out, and roll-ups are no exception.

Smokers who use e-cigarettes are likely to stop or reduce their smoking, claims an independent review of trial data.

Almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later, and around one-third had cut down.

The review of two trials is published today in The Cochrane Library, the world’s leading producer of systematic reviews.

Controversy continues over whether e-cigarettes have net benefits, amid fears that using them in public places will ‘re-normalise’ smoking, especially among young people, and reverse declining smoking rates. 

‘January is a time when many people make New Year’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking.

‘Millions of people have used Smokefree support (the NHS’s stop smoking programme) and we are hoping that this year, even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer.’

Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years.

Health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas.

Forest described the campaign as ‘rotten’, ‘poisonous’ and an ‘abuse of public money’.

Mr Clark said: ‘There can't be a sane adult in the United Kingdom who isn't well aware of the health risks of smoking.

‘What's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics.

‘Campaigns like this are an abuse of public money. Education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it's human nature to switch off when you're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis.

‘This is real life, not a Hammer Horror film.’
