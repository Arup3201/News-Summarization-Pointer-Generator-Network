Emre Can lasted just 21 minutes of his Liverpool debut as the post-Luis Suarez era in England started with a whimper.

Can, a £10million signing from Bayer Leverkusen this summer limped down the tunnel after appearing to tweak a muscle in his right leg.

Preston (first half): Jones, Woods, Clarke, Wright, Buchanan, KilKenny, Brownhill, Browne, Hayhurst, Gallagher, Garner.

Second half: Stuckmann, Wiseman, King, Huntington, Davies, Humphrey, Welsh, Keane, Laird, Davies, Little.

Liverpool: B Jones, Kelly, Flanagan (Coates), Skrtel (Stewart), Wisdom (Coady), Lucas (Peterson), Allen (L Jones) , Can, Coutinho (Rossiter), Lambert, Borini (Adojan).

It was a big disappointment for the 20-year-old who is tipped as Steve Gerrard's long-term successor as a holding midfielder and fellow debutant Rickie Lambert fared little better, missing two chances before wholesale changes were made at half-time.

League One Preston provided what little intensity existed and after Joe Garner had been foiled by Brad Jones, the home side went ahead on the stroke of half-time through Josh Brownhill.

The highly-rated youngster, who was watched by Arsenal, converted from close range.

Despite the game being shown live on BT Sport, it descended into a farce with so many substitutions that 47 players (23 from Liverpool and 24 from Preston) were eventually involved.

One of them, Suso, levelled for Liverpool midway through the second half before Kristoph Peterson put them ahead 14 minutes from time.
