A helicopter that crashed in northeastern Pennsylvania was found Sunday along with the bodies of all five passengers, including one child.

The helicopter plunged into a remote ravine near a wind farm in Noxen Township on Saturday night after the pilot told air traffic controllers he was losing altitude.

Wyoming County coroner Thomas Kukuchka said the pilot contacted a nearby tower around 10:30 p.m. saying he would attempt to return to another airfield nearby.

‘That's when he went off radar,’ Kukuchka said.

Although the names of those on board have not been released, Kukuchka said three men, a woman and a child were on board the Robinson 66 helicopter.

‘It appears to be a father and son, a father and daughter and the pilot,’ he said.

Kukuchka did not release the ages of the victims. He said his office was trying to reach family members of the deceased in Leesburg, Virginia, Ellicot City, Maryland, and Kitnersville, Pennsylvania.

Search: Major William Schlosser of the Civil Air Patrol explained that search and rescue teams located the crash site using the helicopters emergency beacon and handheld radio devices

Route: The Robinson 66 helicopter took off Saturday from a small New York state airport en route to Lehighton, Pennsylvania. It went down sometime Saturday night in a ravine in Noxen Township, Pennsylvania

The Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter took off from Greater Binghamton Airport in New York but officials there said it had actually originated at a smaller airfield nearby, Tri Cities Airport in Endicott. A phone message left at Tri Cities Airport was not immediately returned Sunday night.

Search and rescue teams searched along the helicopter’s route through rugged Wyoming County using portable receivers to locate the helicopter using its emergency beacon, according to WNEP.

‘When an aircraft is in distress there is a beacon that gets set off, and we have receivers that can say it is to our left or to our right,’ Incident commander Major William Schlosser of the Civil Air Patrol told WNEP.

Cause? The helicopter went down in a Noxen Township, Pennsylvania ravine on Saturday near this wind farm. Bad weather and poor visibility may have contributed to the crash

It was not clear if weather played a role in the crash, but Kukuchka said there were severe thunderstorms in the area Saturday night. The coroner and police said rough weather contributed to the difficulty of the search; the wreckage was located shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday.

The FAA said the helicopter was bound for Jake Arner Memorial Airport in Lehighton.

The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation, the FAA said.

Vehicle: The passengers were flying in a Robinson 66 like the one pictured when it went down outside Scranton, Pennsylvania, killing all five of them
