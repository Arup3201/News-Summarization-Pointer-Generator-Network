Even at this level, this is a fixture that nobody wants to lose, where neither side will give an inch. This encounter was no exception, the two teams eventually sharing the spoils.

Manchester United against Liverpool always brings up the mercury, raising the tension in the dugout and on the pitch.

In this sense, it was a little odd to see one of English football's most famous clashes diluted into a rather timid affair. As Nicky Butt watched on, now a coach with his former club, he may have secretly pined for a return to the visceral intensity that we are accustomed to when Manchester United meet Liverpool.

Youth coaches continue to agonise over the absence of a competitive edge in the Under-21 leagues and with a smallish crowd in attendance, the usual aggro and needle was absent.

Some will welcome the more cerebral and tactical approach and it was certainly pleasant to see English talent comfortable in fluid formations.

United, in particular, are a curious watch these days, at any age group. The Louis van Gaal philosophy is filtering down into Warren Joyce's reserve side and United played for the second consecutive league game with the 3-5-2 system that the Dutchman is attempting to instill into his senior players. The thinking is that it will prepare players for the step up as Van Gaal looks to unearth the latest young gems from the United academy.

For an hour or so, both sides appeared to lacked the wit or know-how to force a breakthrough. A steady United performance yearned for the inspiration of James Wilson, the club's most exciting talent who scored four against Manchester City just a few weeks ago. He has been training with the first-team, his performances a cut above at this level.

Several other rising stars, such as Tyler Blackett and Reece James, are also in line to be heavily involved when Louis van Gaal's first team travel to Sunderland this weekend. On another night, this team could also have included the mercurial talents of Wilfried Zaha and Nick Powell. Liverpool were missing Jordan Ibe, who took his place in the smart seats.

As it was, this was a United performance of measured control, exuding a calm authority in possession and discipline without the ball. Tom Thorpe was a commanding force at centre-half, taking any encroachment into the penalty area as a personal affront. It is a surprise Van Gaal is yet to involve him in the first-team set-up.

It is clear United are still learning in this system and the coach Joyce was guiding his players throughout, urging young Joe Rothwell to fill the pockets of space in the Juan Mata role and gesticulating at Ben Pearson, a holding midfielder, to get tighter to Liverpool's bright young talent Jordan Rossiter.

Equaliser: Tom Lawrence levels things up from close range despite the close attention of Reds defenders

Initially, this was a slow burner, devoid of vibrancy and imagination. Liverpool tried the harder to build some momentum, underpinned by the movement of Sheyi Ojo, who harried United's defenders at every opportunity. When goalkeeper Joel Perreira received the ball, Ojo was there in a flash, closing down a clearance that very nearly rebounded into the goal.

United's attacking forays were notable only for a whippped delivery across the goalmouth, when Paddy McNair timed his run, caught it with the instep, but somehow diverted wide with the goal gaping.

The breakthrough, when it came just past the hour mark, was worth the wait. Jordan Lussey had already given United advance notice of his potency from range, crafting one curling effort inches wide of Perreira's goal in the first-half. It was his free-kick from 25 yards that opened the scoring, drilled hard and low into the right-hand corner of the goal. 

Not settling for a point: Lawrence headed for the centre circle after scoring the equaliser

United's response was instant, as if they suddenly remembered that defeat at Liverpool resounds through this club, whether it be a youth game or European Cup final.

Substitute James Weir tiptoed his way through the Liverpool defence, reaching the byline and calmly squaring for Tom Lawrence to side-foot into the roof of the net.

Moments later, Lawrence galloped forward again, driving a swerving effort that brought a smart stop from Danny Ward.

The tempo rose as Liverpool pushed on with greater urgency. A quick free-kick released Sergi Canos, who was thwarted by the sprawling frame of Pereira.

Liverpool continued to press, swinging dangerous set-pieces but United continued to stand tall. This, as ever, was simply a game they were not prepared to lose.
