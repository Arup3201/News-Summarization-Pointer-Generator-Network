Death: Daniel Jones, who ingested a small but lethal amount of heroin at his home in Wolverhampton

A toddler killed when he took a fatal heroin overdose in
the house where he lived with his drug-addicted parents was failed by social services, according to a report.

In May last year, 23-month-old Daniel Jones ingested a tiny but
lethal amount of heroin at the family’s home in Wolverhampton.

A serious case review published today concluded those
tasked with looking out for the toddler failed to properly assess the risk
of harm presented to him by his parent’s habitual drug use.

If care workers, doctors and health professionals had been
more ‘professionally curious’, had more ‘respectful uncertainty’ and been ‘more
assertive’ in their approach to the family, Daniel’s death may have been
avoidable, it concluded.

The report stated there had been ‘a number of missed
opportunities’ to intervene in the boy’s care by the different agencies
involved.

However, it also acknowledged there had been ‘examples of good inter-agency
working’.

The report’s authors also said despite the
parents’ long-standing drug addiction, none of the care workers involved in the
case foresaw the risk that Daniel might be exposed to heroin, or other
substances.

Earlier this year, Daniel’s father Simon Jones, 30, was
jailed for six years after admitting the boy’s manslaughter.

His mother
Emma Bradburn, 34, received four years after pleading guilty to allowing the
toddler’s death.

Jones fully accepted culpability for his son’s death, admitting he had been taking heroin when his son fell ill.

Bradburn was drug-tested following her arrest and found to be clear of the
drug.

At their sentencing hearing in July this year, judge Mrs
Justice Thirlwall told the couple it was beyond doubt they had loved their
little boy but, she added: ‘You failed woefully to protect him from the very
obvious dangers you exposed him to.

‘The danger was mortal danger, as you should have realised,’
she said.

Following the death, Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children
Board immediately launched a serious case review - carried out whenever a child
has died and abuse or neglect is suspected to have been a factor.

The board’s chairman Alan Coe said: ‘What comes across very
strongly from this serious case review is that practitioners who worked with
Daniel and his family should have looked beyond his apparent well-being and
understood what life was like from his perspective.

‘That they failed to do this is clearly unacceptable, and we
have a duty to Daniel to ensure that, as far as is possible, the same thing
doesn’t happen again.’

He added many parents, who had drug addictions, coped with
being parents.

The report has put forward 44 recommendations, which have
now either been acted upon or are being implemented, relating to better support
for frontline staff, improvement to working practices and particularly
assessments of the risk harm to a child, and also better inter-agency
communication.

Addiction: Daniel's father Simon Jones, 30 and Emma Bradburn, 34,  pictured with their son at their Wolverhampton home. They both used drugs in the house

Both Jones - who had served time in jail for
robbery  and Bradburn, 34, were known to
the addiction services team which at the time was run by the Black Country
Partnership NHS Foundation Trust prior to Daniel’s birth.

There was a history of domestic trouble between the couple,
with Bradburn, a heavy drinker, on a prescription for methadone, having been a
heroin addict for 12 years.

When she became pregnant with Daniel, they were referred to
Wolverhampton City Council’s children’s services, and following his birth his
development was monitored by health visitors from The Royal Wolverhampton NHS
Trust.

The report found that 'Daniel died as a result of an event
that had not been foreseen by any of the professionals involved with the
family' but concluded a more assertive approach by care workers might have made
all the difference.

Findings: Had social services been more 'professionally curious' and 
been 'more assertive' in their approach to the family, Daniel's death 
may have been avoidable, a report today concluded

It acknowledged the parents had not always been
co-operative, but concluded this had made follow-up work all the more
important.

However, the report set out the frequent examples where it
found those checks were simply not carried out, or followed through on.

There were 11 multi-agency Child in Need meetings between
the parents and care and health workers.

But the report’s authors said the
action plans developing out of these meetings were 'not robust and did not
sufficiently address the risks to Daniel of his parents’ substance use.'

‘There do not appear to have been any significant changes
effected by the Child in Need plan over the almost two years that it had been
in place.’

Bradburn, suffering constant pain and disability from a
severe accident prior to the birth of her son, was getting medication from her
GP but also topped up the methadone she was prescribed by taking heroin, she
said, to cope with her on-going discomfort.

The report said: ‘Unfortunately there was no collaborative
working between the GP practice and the addiction service, which may have
better addressed her pain and reduced her need for illicit drugs.’

Board chairman Mr Coe said the parents’ drug-use meant their ‘capacity to
meet his needs was compromised’, adding different care and health workers had ‘failed
to fully understand the potential impact of their drug use on Daniel’.

‘Their focus was too much on the parents, and not enough on
their son and the family unit as a whole.

‘Their assessments depended on the parents’ co-operation and
candour, and this was not always forthcoming.

‘Had the practitioners challenged them properly, they may
have appreciated the full extent of the potential risks that Daniel faced.’

Mr Coe added: ‘It is important to stress that things do
change as a result of tragedies like this. Already, we’ve seen a number of
improvements.’

He said the board would be monitoring the implementation of
its recommendations.

Aware: Both Jones, who had served time in jail for robbery and Bradburn,

 Daniel's birth

A spokesman for the Black Country NHS trust said: ‘Although
the trust does not provide these addiction services any more, during the 10
months following Daniel’s death, we took action to improve the way the service
supported the whole family and took into account the impact that substance
misuse has upon a child.

‘These improvements were transferred over to the new
provider when the service was decommissioned in April 2013.’

The Royal Wolverhampton Trust, in a statement, said: ‘Patient
safety is of paramount importance to us so we will take the review’s findings
on board and learn any lessons we can in terms of safeguarding children.’

John Welsby, Wolverhampton council assistant children’s services
director, said it was ‘very clear that more could and should have been done by
the agencies who worked with Daniel and his family, including the council’.

He added: ‘If the parents are deemed capable of looking
after their child, they must be given, and be seen to act upon, clear advice
about ensuring their children remain safe.This didn’t happen in this instance.’

He added the council had fully accepted all the
recommendations, had implemented changes, and was ‘determined to do all we can
to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening again’.

‘Once again, I’d like to offer our sympathies to Daniel’s
family and reassure them that, through the changes we and our partner agencies
are making, we will be doing all we can to keep our children and young people
safer in the future.’
