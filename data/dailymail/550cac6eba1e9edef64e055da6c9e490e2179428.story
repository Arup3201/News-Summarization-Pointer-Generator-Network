James Anderson and Joe Root combined to break a number of records as England took the lead on day four of the first Test against India at Trent Bridge.

England had begun the day trailing India by 105 runs with Anderson and Root putting on an unbeaten 54 for the last wicket on Friday.

But instead of going the same way as their colleagues Sam Robson, Gary Ballance and Ian Bell, who were quickly bowled out in the middle session on day three, the pair united to break the record for the highest last wicket stand in Test cricket.

Leading the way: James Anderson was in imperious form for England on day four of the first Test

Anderson also took his first ever half century and recorded the highest score by an England No 11, breaking John Snow's 59 against the West Indies at The Oval in 1966.

The partnership also produced the longest innings by a No 11 in Test match cricket and England's biggest ever last wicket partnership.

As if that wasn't enough the match went into the record books as the first where both No 11s have scored 50 runs.

Root also recorded his fourth Test century as the 23-year-old combined with Anderson to notch a joint score of well over 200.

The run eventually came to  an end after lunch when Shikhar Dhawan caught Anderson out on 81 leaving England 496 all out with a lead of 39.

Anderson will continue to wait for his first Test century but he has more pressing matters at hand, as Alec Steward reminded him on Twitter.

Steward said: 'Superb effort from Root and Anderson. Now back to your real day job Jimmy of taking wickets on this minefield!'
