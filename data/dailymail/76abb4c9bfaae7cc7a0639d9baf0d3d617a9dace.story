Kirstie Alley's daughter Lillie is in mourning over the death of her fiancé Nick Trela.

Lillie, 20, is so distraught that she has refused to leave her home except to attend a memorial service for 23-year-old Nick Trela at the Hollywood Scientology Center.

Fellow Scientologist Trela was killed in a motorcycle accident in Los Angeles last month. He died instantly after being sideswiped by a car.

He and Lillie, who he dated for four years, had been planning their wedding.

Soul mates: 'Nick was her first love,' says a friend of the family. 'They have been dating since she was 16, even living under the same roof. She worries that she will never fall in love again, get married or have children.'

Instead Dancing with the Stars contender Alley led mourners, including Hollywood and Scientology John Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston, in a heartbreaking outdoor ceremony just before Thanksgiving. 

Both are close friends of Alley and have been there for her during this troubling time, say friends.

Scientology leaders even made a rare exception by allowing Lillie's actor father Parker Stevenson to attend the memorial.

He left the church after divorcing Alley. Their 15-year marriage ended in 1997.

Trela grew up near the Church of Scientology's headquarters in Clearwater, Florida.

He worked at the Scientology-owned Delphian School in rural Oregon and was best friends with Lillie's 22-year-old brother True.

The siblings, who were adopted by Alley and Stevenson as babies, are devastated over Trela's death.

Friends fear Lillie will never return to Los Angeles because she is haunted by the tragedy.

She has spent the last weeks in seclusion at Alley's Clearwater compound.

'Everyone is very concerned about Lillie,' a friend of the family tells MailOnline.

'Nick was her first love. They have been dating since she was 16, even living under the same roof.

'She worries that she will never fall in love again, get married or have children.'

Kirstie was married to actor Parker Stevenson, who starred in The Hardy Boys, from 1983 to 1997

Trela's friends are also devastated by the tragedy. And one, Kylor Melton, posted a five-minute video online to celebrate his life.

Featuring film and photographs of Trela with Lillie, Alley and countless friends, the tribute depicts a handsome young man snorkeling, swimming, messing around in the snow and riding his beloved motorbike.

There are also childhood pictures, shots of his college graduation and vacations around the world.

'One of the best friends I've ever had and one of the brightest lights in our universe,' Melton wrote in a posting to accompany the video tribute.

'One of the only people I've ever known who could take my energy and play, truly play, with all his heart. I will always love you brother.

'Here's a little tribute to you. Keep being a rock star. Catch you in the next life.'

Stacey Goncalves, who works for Alley at her home in Oregon, added a tribute online, saying: 'Nick was that "spark" in a room.

'It's so unfair how short some are here. He's going to be missed,' said friend Stacey Goncalves

'It's so unfair how short some are here. He's going to be missed.'

Stacey, 51, got to know Nick when he visited the Alley family home in Jacksonville two summers ago with Lillie.

'He was a good kid,' she told Mail Online.

'I don't know the specifics of the accident but he was making a left turn on his motorcycle and some lady hit him.

'I haven't spoken to Lillie personally but I called up to make sure she was doing ok.

'It is so sad. He came up here a couple of summers ago with Lillie and they had a great time.'

Lillie and Nick fell in love with rural Oregon after meeting at Scientology's Delphian School when she was 16 and he was three years her senior.

The private boarding school, which costs $42,000 a year, is set in 800 acres near the tiny town of Sheridan.

Tom Cruise sent his daughter Isabella to the secretive establishment, which was once a Jesuit monastery, and other famous allumni include Crash director Paul Haggis's daughter Lauren.
