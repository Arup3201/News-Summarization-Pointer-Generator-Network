A man who sued Sotheby's for £11million after claiming they sold an Old Master by Caravaggio for just £42,000 yesterday lost his High Court damages claim.

Lancelot William Thwaytes, who inherited the work known as The Cardsharps from a cousin, now faces paying a huge chunk of a £6million legal bill.

Mrs Justice Rose cleared Sotheby's of any negligence over its assessment of the painting and said the firm was entitled to rely on its Old Masters specialists in deciding its quality was 'not sufficiently high to indicate that it might be by Caravaggio'.

Old Master: The Cardsharps by Caravaggio, who was born in Milan in 1571 was at the centre of the legal fight

Mr Thwaytes had argued that if Sotheby's had done its job properly he could have got much more for the painting.

Mrs Justice Rose ordered Mr Thwaytes to pay £1.8m of Sotheby's £3.75m bill within 14 days.

Although he has insurance worth £2.4m he must also pay his own legal costs put at over £2m.

The firm's lawyers said his claim was never worth millions and was 'bonkers'. Mr Thwaytes is considering an appeal.

Sotheby's said in a statement: 'Sotheby's is delighted that today's ruling dismisses all claims brought against the company and confirms that Sotheby's expertise is of the highest standards.

'After a four-week trial in which five witnesses for Sotheby's and three independent experts gave testimony, the judge concluded that Sotheby's was not negligent and that the Sotheby's Old Master Painting specialists who assessed the work were 'highly qualified,' examined the painting 'thoroughly,' and reasonably came to the view that the quality of the painting was 'not sufficiently high' to merit further investigation.'
