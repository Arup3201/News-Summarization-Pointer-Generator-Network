Taco Bell customers who may have been wondering about the ingredients in the fast-food chain's beef now have their answer.

The national chain of Mexican-inspired restaurants, owned by Yum! Brands, has launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12 per cent of Taco Bell's beef that is not actually beef.

The company concedes that the ingredients in the 12 per cent 'signature recipe' have weird names - perfect for tongue twisters.'

The meat of the matter: Taco Bell recently launched a new page on its official website explaining the contents of the 12per cent of its beef that is not really beef (pictured, the Doritos Locos tacos)

Coming clean: The fast-food giant has admitted a few years ago that only 88 per cent of its beef is beef, leaving 12 per cent made up of flavoring and coloring agents

But the page goes on to say that all the items, many of which sound like they belong in a chemistry kit, 'are completely safe and approved by the FDA.'

‘They're common ingredients also found in food items at your grocery store,’ the company states.

‘Each ingredient helps make our Seasoned Beef taste great. Many of them are items you might use at home such as salt, peppers, and spices. Ingredients like oats and sodium phosphates help make sure the texture is right.’

According to Taco Bell, they start each of the 2billion tacos served up every year with USDA-inspected quality beef, then add water to keep it moist, toss in 'Mexican spies and flavors,' plus oats, yeast, citric acid and 'other ingredients' to ensure the consistency of their 'seasoned beef.'

The company, however, insists on the site that the Taco Bell beef does not contain any fillers.

In response to speculations that Taco Bell uses low-quality beef in its menu items, the explainer page indicates that the fast-food giant purchases 300million pounds of '100 per cent premium real beef, period.' 

So what is in Taco Bell's signature recipe, you ask?

One of the components is torula yeast - a type of yeast that infuses plain beef a more savory falvor, according to the restaurant chain.

Another ingredient is a naturally occurring sugar that goes by the not overly appetising name 'trehalose.'

No serving of Taco Bell beef is complete without an artificial 'black pepper flavor,' a winning combination of caramel color and cocoa powder to make the meat appear more beefy, and modified corn starch.

The online explainer helpfully points out that corn is a food staple in Mexican culture, adding that Taco Bell cooks add only a small amount of the starch as thickener.

Also on the menu is maltodextrin - a 'mildly sweet sugar' added to balance the flavor - and sodium phosphates, which the company states are also found in cheeses, coffee drinks and desserts to make sure the foods 'the right texture.'

‘We believe it’s important that consumers make informed decisions about what they eat, and so for many years have provided details of our ingredients on our website,’ Taco Bell spokesman Rob Poetsch told ABCNews.com.

Taco Bell's unexpected move toward greater transparency comes at a time when the company is trying to take on the McDonald’s juggernaut by offering its own breakfast menu.

Taco Bell was forced to change its marketing practices and come clean about the ingredients in its lineup of Mexican favorites back in 2011 in response to a class-action lawsuit claiming that the chain's seasoned beef did not contain enough beef to justify the usage of that term.
