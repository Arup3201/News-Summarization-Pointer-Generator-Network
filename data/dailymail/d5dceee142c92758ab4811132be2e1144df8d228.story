Quitting smoking in middle age or beyond still has significant health benefits, new research suggests.

Even lifelong smokers who gave up smoking later on in life still experienced a massive 40 per cent reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke within just five years.

The study followed nearly 9,000 German people aged between 50 and 74 years for ten years.

Age is no barrier to the benefits of giving up smoking

The researchers found that even those who were well into old age were able to reverse some of the damage they had inflicted on their body.

Professor Hermann Brenner and his 
colleagues from the German Cancer Research Centre  were able to show that smokers were at double the risk of 
developing heart disease compared to non-smokers, but that former 
smokers were at almost the same low rate as people of the same 
age who have never smoked.

'We also found that smokers are affected [by heart disease] at a significantly younger age than 
individuals who have never smoked or have stopped smoking,' he added.Â 

The results suggest that smoking 
cessation programs, which tend to concentrate on younger participants, should be expanded to help older people as well.

The study has reinforced news that it is never too late to give up the habit and reap very real health benefits.

A Canadian study published earlier this year demonstrated that people who give up smoking by the age of 44 can live almost as long as those who have never smoked.

Stub it out: Giving up cigarettes can have almost immediate health benefits

'Quitting smoking before age 40, and 
preferably well before 40, gives back almost all of the decade of lost life from continued smoking,' study leader Professor Prabhat Jha.

The researchers found that people who quit smoking between the ages of 35 and 44 gained about nine years and those who quit between ages 45-54 and 55-64 gained six and four years of life, respectively.

And it isn't just poor health that can be reversed when you kick the habit - it is possible to reverse the toll smoking has had on your skin, too.

'To an extent it is possible to undo the damage smoking does to your skin,' says dermatologist Prof Nick Lowe.

'As soon as you stop smoking, your body is able to function more effectively.

'Within six weeks the skin will be visibly benefiting from increased oxygen and antioxidant levels, but you must adopt a strict skin-care regime.'

Within just FIVE years of quitting the risk is same as non-smoker, say German researchers
