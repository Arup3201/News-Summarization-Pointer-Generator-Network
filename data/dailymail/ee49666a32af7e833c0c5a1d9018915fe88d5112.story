A series of blunders: Dr Samina Tahseen outside her Fitness to Practice Panel hearing in Manchester

A consultant who removed the wrong fallopian tube from a patient was 'hasty, careless, and dismissive' before, during and after the procedure, a tribunal has found.

Dr Samina Tahseen, who botched an operation to remove an ectopic pregnancy and left the woman - referred to as Patient A - unable to conceive naturally, was found to have made a series of errors over an 18-hour period at Royal Derby Hospital.

A Fitness to Practise panel, held by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, found Dr Tahseen’s fitness to practice had been impaired by the misconduct.

The finding said the doctor had acted 'against the patient’s interests' and that her actions had 'undermined public confidence in the medical profession'.

Dr Nigel Hester, chairman of the panel, said: 'You did not provide good clinical care to Patient A.

'You acted against your patient’s interests and failed to take action when this was brought to your attention.

'The panel is of the opinion that your actions have caused patient harm, have brought the profession into disrepute and have undermined public confidence in the profession.'

The panel noted that while she had an 'unblemished career' before and after the incident, Dr Tahseen had 'failed Patient A during each stage of her care and treatment'.

It said: 'You were careless in your pre-operative approach, hasty in your intra-operative approach and dismissive of the patient’s concerns in your post-operative approach.'

Dr Tahseen admitted to the panel previously that she had not checked which tube contained the ectopic pregnancy and did not correctly identify the tube during the surgery on September 21, 2010.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg begins to develop outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes. The pregnancy can cause life-threatening bleeding if left untreated.

Patient A had been trying to conceive for about two years when she fell pregnant but went to her GP when she suffered bleeding.

After
initially being told she had suffered a miscarriage and ordered to 
rest, the woman went to Royal Derby's Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit 
when the bleeding worsened.

Doctors
discovered she had an ectopic pregnancy and told her she 
would have to undergo surgery to remove the affected tube.

Patient A, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was concerned after the operation and challenged what had happened as she had pain in her right side.

The patient had previously been told that the ectopic pregnancy had been present in her left fallopian tube.

The panel heard that, when challenged, Dr Tahseen said it was obvious that the right side must have had the ectopic pregnancy.

Bernadette Baxter, prosecuting, said: 'Dr Tahseen was then told the woman had a cyst in her right fallopian tube - a separate and unrelated issue. She had looked shocked and had asked to see the patient’s notes.'

Dr Tahseen did not order further tests before telling the patient to go home, where the pregnancy ruptured.

The patient then underwent emergency surgery to have the correct fallopian tube removed, meaning she lost both tubes in three days.

The panel will now decide what sanctions will be bought against Dr Tahseen.
