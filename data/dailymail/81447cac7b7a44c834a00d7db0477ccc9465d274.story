Letty Amelia Bradford has been charged with criminal damage after allegedly keying another parent's car in apparent revenge for having been overtaken in the school parking lot

A mother allegedly caused $600 worth of damage to another parent's car  in an apparent road-rage attack on the school run.

Letty Amelia Bradford has been accused of using a key to scratch the SUV apparently in revenge for having been overtaken in the school parking lot.

She was  identified on surveillance footage at the school in Alpharetta, Georgia.

After her arrest, she apologised to the family whose car was damaged, saying she 'having a bad day'.  

She told Channel 2: 'It was a stressful time, right before the holidays, and with having to take time off work and she basically pushed my buttons.

'I did something that I've never done before and I never will do something like that again.' 

The incident happened on December 16 when parents arrived at Hillside Elementary school for a Christmas show.

But it took several weeks for police to identify Bradford on CCTV footage.

A woman, who has not been named, told police that she was trying to park, but found Bradford was not moving in front of her.

In order to get past her, she said she drove around and went into a parking space.

When she returned, she found the front passenger door of her Kia Sorrento had been scratched. 

She was charged with criminal damage to property and disrupting public school.

Bradford was released from the Fulton County jail after posting $5,000 bond, booking records showed, and has vowed to pay for the damage.

She has a court date in a few weeks.
