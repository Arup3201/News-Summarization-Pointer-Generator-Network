Hundreds of family and friends of Robin Williams today gathered for a memorial service to pay tribute to the late comedian, it has been reported. 

Comedienne Whoopi Goldberg, actor Billy Crystal and actress Bonnie Hunt were among dozens of stars to attend the two-hour ceremony at San Francisco's Curran Theatre.

They were joined by Williams's third wife Susan Schneider, 50, and children Zak, 31, Zelda, 25, and 22-year-old Cody, according to reports.

It comes six weeks after the 63-year-old Good Will Hunting star, who was battling the early stages of Parkinson's Disease, took his own life at his home near Paradise Cay in California.

Today, his relatives and friends listened to a series of emotional speeches, before attending a reception at the nearby Westin St Francis Hotel, a source told the New York Daily News.

Crystal, a longtime friend of Williams who paid tribute to the Mrs Doubtfire actor during the Emmy Awards last month, was reportedly 'in tears' as he opened the memorial.

Goldberg, Hunt and Williams's three children later gave speeches, before guests heard a musical tribute from Stevie Wonder with the Glide Memorial choir, it is said.

The venue itself was decorated with posters of Williams, while attendees were given ribbon wristbands reading, 'Love the stillness of life', according to US Weekly.

Other guests included actors Seth Green, Ben Stiller, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, cyclist Lance Armstrong, director George Lucas and Williams's 'Mork & Mindy' co-star Pam Dawber.

Comedians Eddie Izzard, Bette Midler, Joel McHale, Jeff Bridges, Josh Groban and Marlo Thomas also reportedly turned out to pay tribute to the comedic legend. 

Williams died on the morning of August 11 at his Tiburon home, with the Marin County Sheriff's Office chief deputy coroner later confirming he had hanged himself .

Just a day after his death, he was cremated following an autopsy, with his ashes scattered at San Francisco Bay.

His funeral later took place at Monte's Chapel Of The Hills, a picturesque funeral home in leafy San Anselmo, according to his death certificate. 

Following Williams's death, his grieving widow revealed he had been struggling with deep depression, anxiety and a secret diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease.

Actor Rob Schneider, a long-term friend of Williams, said he believed the comedian's suicide was brought on in part because of new medication he was taking to combat the disease.

He tweeted: ‘Now that we can talk about it #Robin Williams was on a drug treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s. One of the side effects is suicide.’

Experts say Parkinson’s Disease can make symptoms of depression worse.

Earlier this week, The Bourne Identity actor Matt Damon paid tribute to Williams, whom he said he 'owed everything' to.

Damon, who launched his career with Ben Affleck in 1997 film Good Will Hunting, told Yahoo! News: 'Ben [Affleck] and I owe everything to him. He said yes to our movie and he got it made.

'I could never thank him enough. I look around at the life I have and how blessed I feel and so much of it started with him.'

The 43-year-old actor added that he was 'shocked' when Williams committed suicide last month and hopes the tragedy will raise awareness of depression and how debilitating it can be.
