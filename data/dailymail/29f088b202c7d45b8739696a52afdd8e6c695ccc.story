Former Premier League star Jermaine Jenas must have left a lasting impression on Noel Gallagher during the duo's recent Match of the Day 2 appearance.

Former Forest player Jenas, who had spells with Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers among others, sat in the studio with the former Oasis man last month to evaluate the days' games.

And it must have been more than just football that the duo had in common as the 32-year-old took to Twitter on Friday night to give his followers a brief glimpse behind the scenes at one of Gallagher's gigs.

The former Oasis man was performing at Nottingham's Capital FM Arena, but he still had time to pose with the footballers' wife Ellie and some friends.

Jenas was obviously on camera duty as the former England international, who made 21 appearances for the Three Lions scoring one goal, was nowhere to be seen in the picture.

Two other people that were nowhere to be seen were MOTD2 duo Mark Lawrenson and Mark Chapman, but Nottingham-born Jenas did at least give the duo a shout-out on social media.
