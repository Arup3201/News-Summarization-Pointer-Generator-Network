Model Debbie Baigrie was walking to her car in down town Tampa Bay when a 13-year-old Ian Manuel approached her.

The youngster and a friend demanded change for a $20 bill, but seconds later the boy drew his gun and shot her in the mouth.

Baigrie, who was 28 at the time and had just had her second child, required years of facial reconstructive surgery while Manuel was charged with attempted murder and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences in an adult prison.

But more than 25 years after the attack the pair have struck up an unlikely friendship, and now she is campaigning for his release. 

Pictured during a court appearance in 2011, Ian Manuel (left) looks back at Debbie Baigrie (right) who he shot in Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1990. She is now campaigning for his release 

She feels sympathy for the shooter, because he was so young at the time, and is troubled by the racial discrimination in the case.  

'If he was a cute white boy at 13, with little dimples and blue eyes, there's no way this would have happened,' she told the New York Times.

'When you're 13, you do stupid stuff,' she adds before saying 'Walk a mile in his shoes.'

Their correspondence began the second Christmas of Manuel's sentence when he decided to call her. She asked him bluntly why he killed her, he said it was a 'mistake'.

He then sent her a card with a picture of a hand reaching through prison bars to offer a red rose.

Baigrie said: 'I was in such pain. I couldn't eat. I was angry. But I'd go back and forth. He was just a kid.'

The pair have sent letters back and forth for almost two decades. In one Manuel wrote: 'You are about one in a million who would write to a person that’s tried to take their life.'

The mother required years of painful  reconstructive surgeries to her face but now feels sympathy for Manuel, saying that 'When you're 13, you do stupid stuff'

Baigrie maintains that she is the only family Manuel has left - as his mother, father and brother are all dead.  

Manuel was initially given three life sentences, but a Supreme Court decision stating that juveniles could not be given life without parole for charges other than murder means his term was reduced.

He is now scheduled to be released in 2031.

His time in prison has been torrid. He was placed in solitary confinement at age 15 and would stay there until the age of 33. 

At points he would cut himself, repeatedly attempted suicide and is a diagnosed sociopath.

For 18 years Baigrie has been running Natural Muscle Magazine.
