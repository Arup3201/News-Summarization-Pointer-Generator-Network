An entertaining new book on cosplay - short for 'costume play' - collates pictures of hundreds of adults fans dressed up as their favourite fictional characters. 

Having started as a small curiosity in Japan, cosplay is now a global phenomenon, fuelled by the Internet.

One Wonder Woman outfit features chrome cuffs, sparkling spandex, and a metal belt and 'W' on the bust; an almost futuristic version of the iconic superheroine.
