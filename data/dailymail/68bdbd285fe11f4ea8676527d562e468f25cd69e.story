Ade Djajamihardja was just 42 when he suffered a debilitating brain haemorrhage stroke that saw him  hospital-bound for seven months as he tried to recover.

He underwent two major brain surgeries and spent weeks in an induced coma at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital.

Doctors told his wife Kate Stephens he would be lucky to survive and if he did he could kiss walking, talking and even eating by himself goodbye.

But that was two years ago. 

Ade Djajamihardja and his wife Kate returned to their Brighton home in Melbourne two years ago after a seven month stint in hospital 

'I chose to live and I chose a positive outcome,' Ade told Daily Mail Australia. 

While Ade is still confined to a wheelchair and has little sight and movement on his left side, he says his whole outlook on life has changed and he is healthier now than before the stroke. 

'Before the stroke I lost my way with my health because I convinced myself KFC was a food group. I was smoking four packets of cigarettes a day,' he said. 

'Now I meditate everyday, eat whole foods  and even though I'm in a wheelchair I exercise - I've lost 10 kg.

'Just until recently I was walking 500 metres a day, which takes about an hour. I believe that's just outside Olympic qualifying time,' he joked.

Doctors told his wife Kate Stephens he would be lucky to survive and if he did he could kiss walking, talking and even eating by himself goodbye

But his wife Kate, who ran a film and television production company with Ade, said it was a long road for him to be positive about his situation.

'Four months after his stroke they put him in front of a mirror for the first time. During the surgery they took a large part of his skull out - he had to wear a helmet because he had a big dent in his head,' she said. 

'When he looked in the mirror he found it quite upsetting. He asked the pathologist if he would ever drive again and when the doctor said no he started crying.'

Ade had a section of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his brain. He had to wear a helmet most days to protest the visible hole in his head

After six months, doctors operated again to put the piece of his skull back in place. A few weeks later, Kate was able to take Ade home for the first time

Ade told Kate he didn't want to be a burden on her and said he would throw himself down the hospital stairs in his wheelchair.

'But then the nurse reminded us we were on the ground floor so I couldn't even if I tried,' Ade said. 

'That's when I made the big decision and started focusing on my goal of full optimal health.'

During his gruelling six months in rehabilitation, Ade had to learn to breathe, sit up, talk and read again.

'I kept saying, "I’m not stupid, I’m just injured",' he said.

'We would have little ways of coping to make us laugh. I was feeding him like a baby and taking him to the toilet. Ade would always joke, even when he had his skull bone put back in,' Kate said. 

While Ade is still confined to a wheelchair and has little sight and movement on his left side, he says his whole outlook on life has changed and he is healthier now than before the stroke

Ade has started walking for the first time since his stroke. Up until recently he could walk 500 metres a day in one hour

After six months, doctors operated again to put the piece of his skull back in place.

'I briefed the medical team when they put the skull bone back and said if you let me die I’m going to come and haunt you all – it was my way of coping,' Ade said. 

Just a few weeks later, Ade was allowed to go back to his Brighton home for the first time.

The couple have since released a book about Ade's survival tools in hospital and how he was able to stay positive and happy throughout the rough period in his life.

During his gruelling six months in rehabilitation, Ade had to learn to breathe, sit up, talk and read again

Ade has lost 10kg from eating better, giving up smoking and exercising daily with the help of Kate

'I'm very much focused on achieving full health and I wanted to inspire others,' he said. 

'I would like to be financially independent in the next year or so.

'We also haven’t given up the idea of having a child.' 

Little Book of Hope for Stroke Survivors, Care Givers and Anyone Else Going Through a Really Shit Time is available at Ade's website: littlebookofhope.com

World Stroke Day takes place on Wednesday, October 29.
