Beloved: Six-year-old Jack Russell Ruby (left) walked Carmen Hesketh down the aisle, but has now vanished

On Carmen Hesketh’s big day, she wanted to be walked down the aisle by her best friend – her dog Ruby.

And so the Jack Russell terrier accompanied the 29-year-old and her father as he gave her away, before leading the bride and groom out of the church.

But now Miss Hesketh has been left heartbroken after her much-loved pet ran off during a walk and has been missing for ten days.

She fears the six-year-old terrier, with her since she was an eight-week-old pup, and the pet’s daughter Robyn, two, which is also missing, may have been snatched by thieves.

‘My dogs come everywhere with me and I am heartbroken they are gone,’ said Miss Hesketh, from Elmdon, Essex. ‘Ruby has been my loyal best friend for the past six years.

‘When I got married in the summer, Ruby, along with my dad, walked me down the aisle.

‘She was brilliant on our wedding day, you would have thought she had trained for months for the part. When we did the prayers and knelt down she even laid down behind us like a good girl. It was so sweet.’

A friend had taken the dogs for a walk on the farm where Miss Hesketh works on January 6 when they went off to explore and never returned. Neither dog has a collar or has been microchipped.

Miss Hesketh and her husband Stuart Thom, 41, a stud farm manager, have been searching the surrounding area, but so far without any luck.

They are offering a £2,000 reward to anyone who finds the two white and tan terriers.

Miss Hesketh said: ‘I don’t care who took them or why, I just want them back.

Man's best friend: Carmen Hesketh, her husband Stuart and their dogs. They have offered a £2,000 reward

Faithful: Ruby escorted the couple down the aisle but has gone missing with her daughter Robyn, two

Mrs Hesketh said: 'It's terrible without them. It doesn't feel like our family is our family'

‘They could be stuck in a hole as they are Jack Russells, but it is unlikely as at least one of them would probably have got out.

‘I wonder if someone picked them up thinking they were strays.

‘It’s terrible without them, it doesn’t feel like our family is our family. There are two small things missing.’
