It is the most distant cosmic magnifying glass ever found.

Astronomers using Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope have unexpectedly discovered a monster elliptical galaxy so large it has created a lens allowing researcher to see back 9.6 billion years.

The monster elliptical galaxy breaks the previous record holder by 200 million years.

These Hubble Space Telescope images reveal the most distant cosmic lens yet found. The giant elliptical is the red object in the enlarged view at left. Its red color comes from the light from older stars. In the enlarged view, the lighter-colored blobs at upper right and lower left are the distorted and magnified shapes of a more distant spiral galaxy behind the foreground elliptical.

Â  These 'lensing' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends, magnifies, and distorts light from objects behind them, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.

Team members Kenneth Wong and Sherry Suyu of Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei, Taiwan, used the gravitational lensing from the chance alignment to measure the giant galaxy's total mass, including the amount of dark matter, by gauging the intensity of its lensing effects on the background galaxy's light.

The giant foreground galaxy weighs 180 billion times more than our Sun and is a massive galaxy for its epoch.

The object behind the cosmic lens is a tiny spiral galaxy undergoing a rapid burst of star formation.

Its light has taken 10.7 billion years to arrive here.

Seeing this chance alignment at such a great distance from Earth is a rare find.

Locating more of these distant lensing galaxies will offer insight into how young galaxies in the early universe built themselves up into the massive dark-matter-dominated galaxies of today.

Dark matter cannot be seen, but it accounts for the bulk of the universe's matter.

'When you look more than 9 billion years ago in the early universe, you don't expect to find this type of galaxy-galaxy lensing at all,' explained lead researcher Kim-Vy Tran of Texas A&M University in College Station.

'It's very difficult to see an alignment between two galaxies in the early universe.

'Imagine holding a magnifying glass close to you and then moving it much farther away.

'When you look through a magnifying glass held at arm's length, the chances that you will see an enlarged object are high.

'But if you move the magnifying glass across the room, your chances of seeing the magnifying glass nearly perfectly aligned with another object beyond it diminishes.'

'There are hundreds of lens galaxies that we know about, but almost all of them are relatively nearby, in cosmic terms,' said Kenneth Wong and Sherry Suyu of Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei.

'To find a lens as far away as this one is a very special discovery because we can learn about the dark-matter content of galaxies in the distant past.

'By comparing our analysis of this lens galaxy to the more nearby lenses, we can start to understand how that dark-matter content has evolved over time.'

The 'clean' version of the image, showing the surrounding area. Although the elliptical galaxy is hefty, it is not as massive as many of today's galaxies.

Our Milky Way galaxy, for example, is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy.

Our Milky Way galaxy, for example, is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy.

Most of the Milky Way's mass is locked up in dark matter.

The lensing galaxy, however, is underweight in terms of its dark-matter content.

'The unusually small amount of dark matter in this massive, elliptical, lensing galaxy is very surprising,' Suyu said.

'Other elliptical galaxies that are closer to us have much more dark matter and have inventories of stars that appear to be different from this super-distant lensing galaxy.'

The team's results appeared in the July 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
