William Hague today dismissed 'ridiculous' criticism of his decision to spend four days with Hollywood star Angelina Jolie while war raged in Iraq.

The Foreign Secretary appeared to accuse Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys of not asking intelligent questions about his appearances with Miss Jolie and her husband Brad Pitt.

Mr Hague insisted the star-studded summit to end sexual violence against women in war did not divert his attention away from the crisis of the day, stressing the UK government was 'entirely capable of doing both'.

Mr Hague faced criticism for spending four days at the summit, while remaining almost silent on the ongoing conflict in Iraq

Miss Jolie and Mr Hague launched a joint campaign in 2012 to fight sexual violence in war.

It came after she wrote and directed a film, called In the Land of Blood and Honey, in 2011 set during the Bosnian war. Up to 50,000 women were raped during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.

Last week the pair hosted a four-day summit in London, which culminated in a new international protocol which they hope will 'shatter the culture of impunity' around sexual violence in war.

However, it meant that as Islamist jihadists swept through large areas of Iraq, Mr Hague was posing for photographs with two of the world's biggest film stars.

Miss Jolie also made a trip to Downing Street, where she was pictured smiling in the sunshine with David Cameron. 

Today Mr Hague insisted the government was capable of focussing on immediate problems while also addressing long-term issues, like sexual violence in war at the summit.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Anybody who thinks that should have been there, should have come along to it... This is about conflict prevention. 

'It brought together most of the world. We’re not going to solve conflicts of the many sorts we debate on this programme unless we address these appalling crimes. 

'The idea that you can never deal with long-term issues because there’s always something short-term, I always find rather ridiculous.'

He stressed that he had been able to hold talks about Iraq with US Secretary of State John Kerry, who had been in London for the summit. 

And in apparent swipe at Mr Humphrys for even asking the question, he added: 'With respect, I think the basis of your question has less basis than most of the highly intelligent questions.'

The summit attracted delegations from 123 countries. Organisers, hope it will pave the way for more support for survivors of rape of warzones, and a commitment to bring perpetrators to justice as well as ‘raising awareness dramatically’ of the crimes across the world.

Mr Hague added: 'We’re trying to change global attitudes all over the world, which governments alone cannot do. And foreign policy today involves working with different people outside government – NGOs, civil society, people who can reach people who never listen to governments. 

'We’re trying to effect a change in attitudes of the entire world so that the terrible violence meted out to vulnerable people, particularly women all over the world, can be brought to an end or can be greatly diminished.

'And I think we should make those alliances to do that. We don’t stop doing that work because we’re dealing also with the crisis of the day. We’re entirely capable in the British government of doing both.'

Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed Miss Jolie to Downing Street on Tuesday

At the closing ceremony of the summit on Friday, Miss Jolie said she will work with Mr Hague and others for 'as long as it takes' to prevail in the struggle of sexual violence in conflict.

She said the work begun at the summit is 'very, very much linked' with violence against women in other contexts, such as the kidnap of the schoolgirls in Nigeria or the recent rape cases in India and Pakistan. 

She added: 'One of the most heartening aspects of this summit has been to see so many male leaders prepared to confront the taboo surrounding sexual violence in conflict. Indeed I believe one of the outcomes of this summit is that this subject is now firmly on the top table of international diplomacy and we will work to ensure that it stays there…it goes to the heart of international peace and security.’

On Saturday it was announced Jolie had been made a dame by Mr Hague.
