From a four-bedroom bungalow in Atlanta all the way to a tiny studio apartment in New York City, these are examples of just some of the properties on the American market that will set you back less than $125,000.

The list, compiled by real estate website Zillow, shows that citizens can buy a spacious family home with a stylish interior for a relatively low price.

On the flipside however, in cities such as San Francisco, the confined, dinghy apartments on offer are an indication of how property prices are skyrocketing in some metropolitan areas.

The collection of budget homes is revealed as the National Realtors Association confirmed house sales across the country fell to a nine-month low in January. 

Bargain: The homes where you get more for your money includes a blue, wooden-fronted three-bedroom and one bathroom house in Richmond, Virginia, which costs just $109,000 

Cut-price: This three-bedroom bungalow on a tree-lined street in Waco, Texas, will set buyers back $110,000 

The homes where you get more for your money include a blue, wooden-fronted three-bedroom and one bathroom house in Richmond, Virginia.

According to the real estate agent. the $109,000 house is nestled in the Historic Highland Park and comes with hardwood flooring, a family room and a spacious dining room.

Another is a three-bedroom bungalow on a tree-lined street in Waco. Texas. The description says the property 'needs updating' but the space inside means there is room to experiment - all for just $110,000. 

However in San Francisco, first time buyers will have to fork out $127,000 for a dinghy studio apartment.

It is described by Realtors.com as 'luxury city living at its best' and is aimed at first time buyers. There are little luxuries in the condo, but some of the lower level apartments boast outdoor patios.

Similarly, a $109,000 studio in Harlem, New York City, boasts short walks to the nearest Subway stations and is listed as being 'small' but in 'good condition'.

The property markets in both cities, along with Los Angeles, have become virtually unstoppable. 

A budget of $130,000 in the Big Apple may only be enough to purchase a sought-after parking space, let alone a house. 

In San Francisco, if prospective buyers want to purchase a home in the richest third, they will have to spend more than $860,410.  

Landscaped community: In Colorado Springs, Colorado, this two-bedroom, two-bathroom property is just just shy of $110,000 and even has a rear deck and garden 

Even though many residents opt to rent apartments rather than buy family homes, landlords are raising rent by 12 per cent in San Francisco and 9 per cent in New York - which means many low-income buyers are priced out of both sides of the  market.

For the same price of the tiny apartment in Harlem, prospective buyers can get their hands on a two-bedroom and two-bathroom suburban property in Colorado Springs in a 'beautifully landscaped setting'.

It also boasts an rear deck overlooking a garden and ample parking to entertain visitors. It is listed at $109,900.

For $125,000 there is also an adorable 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom bungalow in  Atlanta, Georgia, described by realtors as inviting and stylish.

In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, $100,000 will land you a spacious two-bedroom and one-bathroom home where you can 'entertain guests' with ease.  

The description reads: 'Have an indoor soiree in the spacious living room or bring the fun outdoors to the private fenced backyard and covered patio.' 

A century-old, three- and 1.5-bath home in Louisville, Kentucky, costs only $120,000, while a three-bed, two-bath bungalow in Fort Wayne, Indiana - with enough room for a basketball hoop next to the garage will set buyers back just $115,000. 

Confined: This dinghy studio apartment in San Francisco, meant for first time buyers, is listed at $127,000 and is described as 'city living at its best'

It was revealed on Monday that US existing-home sales slowed to their lowest pace in nine months in January, despite very low mortgage interest rates, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. 

Total sales of used homes fell 4.9 percent from December to an annual rate of 4.82 million units, with the fall in both the single-family unit category and in condominiums.

Sales were 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier, but January 2014 was marked by a sharp downturn in economic activity when wide swaths of the eastern half of the country endured repeated severe winter storm.

'January housing data can be volatile because of seasonal influences,' said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.

'But low housing supply and the ongoing rise in home prices above the pace of inflation appeared to slow sales despite interest rates remaining near historic lows.'

Quaint: This two-bedroom and one-bath home in Fresno, California, is described as 'well-maintained' and is situated on a spacious lot 

Great outdoors: This two-bedroom and one bath home in Spokane, Washington, is said to be well-suited to nature lovers, because of its proximity to the Centennial Trail and Spokane River

Total inventory of used houses for sale increased slightly in the month, and unsold inventory equalled a 4.7-month supply at the current sales pace.

The median price for an existing home was $199,600, 6.2 percent more than in January 2014.

Jennifer Lee of BMO Capital Markets called it 'clearly a disappointing report.'

'There were fewer sales of singles (-5.1 percent) and condos (-3.5 percent) although the former is still above levels a year ago.'

The real estate brokerage Redfin recently reported that sales of properties costing more $1 million climbed 9 percent year-over-year, based on data from the July to October quarters. Overall sales slipped 1.2 percent.

This three-bed, two-bath bungalow in Fort Wayne, Indiana - with enough room for a basketball hoop next to the garage will set buyers back just $115,000. 

Historic: This century-old, three- and 1.5-bath home in Louisville, Kentucky, costs only $120,000 

'Inviting and stylish': This four-bedroom home in Atlanta, Georgia, is on the market for $125,000
