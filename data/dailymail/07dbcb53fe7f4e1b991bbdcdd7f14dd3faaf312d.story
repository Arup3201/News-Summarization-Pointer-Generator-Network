Hannah: The Robinson family who's one-year-old daughter Hannah (above) suffers many life-threatening diseases claim thieves stole their baby's story and began a phony fundraising page to raise $10,000

Sick thieves stole photos of a seriously-ill baby to set up fake fundraiser page to receive $10,000, according to the child's family. 

In May, the Robinson family created a GoFundMe page called 'Hannah's Fight' with the goal of raising $250,000 for their baby, Hannah Robinson.

Hannah was born seven weeks premature and suffers from Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, bowel disease, and other health issues involving her skin and heart, according to their GoFundMe page. 

So far, their campaign has raised more than $13,000, but took a hit when the family discovered that someone had been running a phony 'Hannah's Fight' campaign on Kickstarter -- another fundraising website -- and raised $10,000, the family reported.

The family posted the news Saturday on their GoFundMe page as well as the campaign's Facebook profile.   

The page has since been taken down. 

The family wrote that the thieves used the exact same information the family posted about Hannah and even sometimes posted the family's updates as their own.

'Im not sure what kind of person steals over $10,000 from a sick little girl's campaign,' the family wrote, 'but I guess they felt they needed it more than her. 

'We have prayed for these people and I hope they get the help they need and Hannah's Fight will move forward.'

Medication: Hannah will need lifelong medication and between seven and nine surgeries to fix her health issues, the family says

The family says that Hannah will be on medication for the rest of her life and those medications cost more than $800 per month. 

She will need between seven and nine surgeries to 'fix her issues,' according to the family, and will have to undergo plastic surgery when she is older. 

Though this is a setback for the family that missed out on the $10,000 due to the phony page, this isn't the first time their campaign has taken a hit.

Last month, the campaign was allegedly attacked after receiving support from Stephen Collins, former '7th Heaven' star and accused child molester, according toTMZ. 

Collins only retweeted a tweet on Twitter in an effort to gain support for the sick child, but many of the campaign's supporters attacked the campaign for associating with an accused child molester, TMZ reports. 

TMZ reports that Denver said that he deleted Collins' tweet after being bombarded by angry Hannah supporters who hated that Collins had any involvement in the campaign.
