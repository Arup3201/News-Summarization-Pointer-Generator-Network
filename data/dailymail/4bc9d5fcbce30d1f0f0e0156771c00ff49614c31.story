At first glance it looks like a scene from a Hollywood horror movie.

The tip of the dorsal fin breaking the water, thrashing around as it enjoys a feeding frenzy just a few feet away from a group of swimmers.

But in fact these bathers were in no danger at Porthcurno beach in Cornwall because the giant pictured circling them yesterday was a harmless basking shark.

These toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton, the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark

The 16ft fish was pictured filter feeding just yards away from swimmers who were lucky enough to have the chance close encounter.

Photographer Rachel Hosken took the pictures saying neither the shark nor the swimmers were in any danger.

'It was a very peaceful scene,' she said.

'The shark just carried on feeding and completely ignored the swimmers.'

Basking sharks are normally seen feeding
 off the coast of Devon and Cornwall and the west of the UK throughout 
the spring and summer.

Undeterred by the sheer size of the animal, the brave swimmers try to get a better look

The enormous fish, which have been 
protected since 1998, are the largest in British waters and the second 
largest in the world, after the whale shark.

The evasive fish tend to swim deep in the ocean, but from May to October they come to the surface to feed on plankton blooms.

This year, however, sightings in the south west have not been so frequent, according to Ms Hosken.

'I haven't seen many basking sharks this year. For some reason it looks like it may be a quiet year.'

Cue Jaws music: It may look like a dangerous scene from a Hollywood thriller, but this giant basking shark is in fact harmless

These toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton, the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark.

This fine specimen, while looking imposing, could in fact grow to twice its current size, to an impressive 33ft long.

While they are protected from being fished under the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981, they can often be caught as by-catch particularly in the warmer months when they swim close to the surface.

Their slow feeding at the surface also means they tend to get killed by speed boats, jet-skis and other fast boats that don't see them.Â
