Facing extradition: Julian Assange is now a step closer to being forced out of Britain after the Supreme Court decision to uphold previous rulings

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today lost his Supreme Court fight against extradition to Sweden to face sex crime allegations.

Lawyers for Assange asked Britain's highest court to block his removal, arguing that the European arrest warrant issued against him was 'invalid and unenforceable'.

The Supreme Court judges, who heard the case in February, today announced that they have rejected his challenge.

The court dismissed his appeal by a majority of five to two.

Assange, who was not present for the hearing because his lawyers said he was stuck in traffic, was given 14 days to consider today's ruling before a final decision on his next step in his legal battle. His team indicated they would reopen the case at the Supreme Court.

Today Lord Phillips, president of the court, said the point of law which had to be considered had not been simple to resolve.

The Swedish authorities want Assange, 40, to answer accusations of raping one woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in August 2010 while on a visit to give a lecture.

Assange, whose WikiLeaks website has published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses, says the sex was consensual and the allegations against him are politically motivated.

In November 2011, the High Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Howard Riddle - who sat at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south London, in February 2011 - that the Australian computer expert should be extradited to face investigation.

The High Court declared that it would not be unfair or unlawful to extradite Assange.

The case has become a cause celebre and 
has hearings have previously been attended by celebrities such as Jemima
Khan, film director Ken Loach and former Labour minister Tony Benn.

Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a U.S. air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007.

The whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks.

The U.S. Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise the profile of Assange.

Last year revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds.

The stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange.

But as the fortunes of WikiLeaks have waned - including criticism by newspapers such as the Guardian who were given initial access to the diplomatic cables - fewer high-profile people are willing to back Assange.

The only well-known face to show up today was left-wing journalist John Pilger.

During the appeal hearing in February, Assange's QC Dina Rose argued before Lord Phillips, Lord Walker, Lady Hale, Lord Brown, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson that the Swedish public prosecutor who signed the arrest warrant could not issue a valid document because she lacked impartiality and independence.

Ms Rose QC said his latest appeal 
raised the single issue of law as to whether the Swedish public 
prosecutor constituted a ‘judicial authority’ capable of issuing a valid
warrant under the provisions of the 2003 Extradition Act.

It was common ground that if she did not, there was no legal basis for extradition.

Ms
Rose suggested it was obvious that a public prosecutor whose function 
it was to investigate and prosecute an individual ‘cannot exercise 
judicial authority in relation to that individual’.

As
a matter of fundamental legal principle dating back hundreds of years, a
judicial authority had to be impartial and independent both of the 
executive and the parties in a case.

Clare
Montgomery QC, for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, argued that the 
High Court was plainly correct to accept that the term ‘judicial 
authority’ had a wide and autonomous meaning, and it was not restricted 
in the way described by Ms Rose.

Since
the start of the European arrest warrant (EAW) scheme, it had been the 
practice of a number of prominent member states to issue EAWs through 
public prosecutors.

Ms Montgomery argued: ‘There is no conceivable breach of fundamental rights involved in such a process.’

In the majority ruling today, in which Lady Hale and Lord Mance dissented, the court held that an EAW issued by a public prosecutor is a valid warrant issued by a judicial authority within the meaning of the 2003 Act.

Afterwards, Ms Rose said an application would be made to reopen the case at the Supreme Court on the basis that the court's majority decision was made on legal points not argued during the appeal.

The representative for the two women, lawyer Claes Borgström, told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that the outcome was expected, but ‘strongly criticised’ the Surpreme Court for the amount of time the extradition order has taken.

‘I find it hard to understand why it has taken so long, they’ve had it on their desks since autumn 2010. It has of course gone through all the correct departments, but it has still taken a long time.’

‘I strongly criticise it, it has had a completely unnecessary impact on my clients.’He said that he has not been able to speak to his clients yet but that he expects them to be relieved.

‘Even though a trial is a very strenuous procedure it has always been their wish that he should be forced to take responsibility for his actions. Anything else would be disgraceful.’
