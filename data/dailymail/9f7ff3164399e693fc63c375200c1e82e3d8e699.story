Pesticides are widely blamed for wiping out of bee colonies, but a new hive-friendly crop spray from an unexpected source is in development.

Scientists have discovered that the venom of the world’s deadliest spider will kill of pests but won't  harm bees.

They combined poison from the Australian funnel web spider - whose venom is strong enough to kill a man - with a protein called lectin from the snowdrop plant, to produce an pesticide that is almost harmless to the pollinating insects.

Hv1a/GNA is a pesticide made from the venom of the Australian funnel spider and the snowdrop plant protein lectin.

It is fairly harmless to honeybees as when they were fed it in a lab, it had next to no effect on survival rates.

The pesticide does not affect honeybees' learning and memories which they rely on to find food, unlike some current pesticides.

Scientists think that the chemical cocktail has enormous potential as a 'bee safe' pesticide and could be alternative to neonicotinoids which are thought to be responsible for decimating colonies.

Biologists at the University of Newcastle fed large doses of the pesticide to bees in a lab - far beyond what they would be exposed to in the wild – and found that it had a very slight effect on survival rates.

Unlike some current pesticides, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on their learning and memory, which is key to their foraging for food.

Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has enormous potential as an environmentally friendly ‘bee safe’ pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies.

‘Our findings suggest Hv1a/GNA is unlikely to cause any detrimental effects on honeybees,’ said Professor Angharad Gatehouse of the university.

‘Previous studies have already shown it is safe for higher animals which means it has real potential as a pesticide and offers us a safe alternative to some of those currently on the market.’

The researchers told MailOnline that while humans have not ingested the pesticide, 'all scientific evidence suggests that there is absolutely no danger to humans if this did indeed occur.'

The toxins in spider venom target the central nervous systems of insects, but not mammals and the scientists selected those that are in the pesticide because of the insecticidal activity and lack of toxicity towards higher.

'Even if the toxin did affect mammals it would need to be directly injected rather than ingested by the person because the toxin in combination with the snowdrop protein would not reach it’s site of action if ingested by a human,' they said.

There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim.

Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production.

Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’

The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops.

Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides.

Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years.

Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination.

In the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal B, the bees were exposed to varying amounts of the spider and snowdrop mixture for a week.

Lab member Erich Nakasu said: ‘This is an oral pesticide so unlike some that get absorbed through the exoskeleton, the spider and snowdrop recombinant protein has to be ingested by the insects.’

The new pesticide offers hope of more species-specific pesticides by targeting calcium channels that are linked to memory and learning in bees.

Dr Nakasu explained: ‘Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee, it had no effect on the insect which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee.’

The larvae were also unaffected by the pesticide, which they were able to break down in their gut.

Lab head Dr Geraldine Wright led a recent study highlighting the damaging effect of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids on bees’ ability to learn and remember and subsequently communicate to their hive mates.

She said: 
‘About 90 per cent of the world’s plants are directly reliant on 
pollinators to survive.

'If we destroy the biodiversity of pollinators 
then it will be irrelevant how effective our pesticides are because we 
will not have any crops to protect.’

‘There
 is now substantial evidence linking neonicotinoid pesticides to poor 
performance and survival in bees and what we need now is a clear 
directive from government to develop and introduce bee safe 
alternatives.’

Professor
 Gatehouse added: ‘There is not going to be one silver bullet. What we 
need is an integrated pest management strategy and insect specific 
pesticides will be just a part of that.’

One group of experts has proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop.

Research revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives.

The study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, strengthens the scientists’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die.

It found that bees in the hives exhibiting CCD had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives, most of which survived the winter.

This finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to CCD.

The researchers separated six colonies into three groups -one treated with imidacloprid, one with clothianidin and one untreated.

There was a steady decline in the size of all the bee colonies at the beginning of winter, which is typical among hives during the colder months in New England.

Beginning in January 2013, honeybee populations in the control colonies began to increase as expected, but populations in the neonicotinoid-treated hives continued to decline.

By April 2013, half of the neonicotinoid-treated colonies were lost with abandoned hives that are typical of CCD.
