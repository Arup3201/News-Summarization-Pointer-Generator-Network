Roy Hodgson will ask his players to put their passion on display at the World Cup by belting out the national anthem.

Hodgson has always encouraged his England team to sing loud and proud before the kick-off and plans to remind those players heading to their first tournament that it is a good way to stir emotions. 

The England team touched down in Miami on Sunday night and were pictured arriving at the team hotel.

Before boarding the plane to Miami, the 
England boss said: ‘You very rarely play an international match against 
opponents who haven’t got their hands on their hearts and singing their 
anthem as loud as they can. And we’ve made a decision that’s what we’re 
going to do, too.

‘We are 
proud and we are happy to be wearing that England shirt. We are proud to
 be England players and, in my case, England manager.

'So when the national anthem comes up it’s an obvious one for me that we sing it. 
Let’s do what every other team does.’

GOD SAVE THE QUEEN (first verse)

God save our gracious Queen,Long live our noble Queen,God save The Queen!Send her victorious,Happy and glorious,Long to reign over us,God save The Queen.

It
 was a rule Hodgson introduced when he took over from Fabio Capello 
ahead of Euro 2012.

He plans to reinforce the message to new players 
Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and Ross Barkley.

‘We
 made the decision very early on,’ added Hodgson. ‘They’ve been doing it
 for two years and perhaps we need to remind them, as the squad has 
changed so much. I don’t know if they all sang it against Peru but I 
hope they will.

'We’re great until the second verse comes along because we don’t really know that!’

England
 assistant manager Ray Lewington said: ‘The first time I did it, I 
surprised myself. I’m not emotional but it really got to me.’
