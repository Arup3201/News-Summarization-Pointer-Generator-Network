Mama June has insisted that her children are her top priority in a new video released today - despite damning evidence that she has allowed them to be in contact with her daughter's molester.

The 'Here Come Honey Boo Boo' star spoke out after she was pictured with Mark McDaniel, 53, who was jailed for 10 years for abusing her daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight.

But in videos obtained exclusively by MailOnline on Wednesday, Mama June smiled as she maintained that she had not recently spoken to McDaniel.

'The protection of my kids is my number one priority,' she said outside her Georgia home.

'We are handling this as a family matter,' she said. 'We are doing it behind closed doors, that's how I am. I'm very quiet. I love my family... We're handling what happens privately.'

Unapologetic: Mama June is pictured speaking outside her house on Wednesday, just days after her show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was canceled amid reports she was seeing a child molester 

Denial: As she joked outside her house, she said that she has not spoken to the man, Mark McDaniel, recently 

She added that she will grant a full interview soon - perhaps over the next few days - but would not give an exact date. It will come 'when the time is right', she said.

'I have to think about my family, my kids, I have a lot of things to think about,' she said on the video. 'My kids are my number one priority.'

It comes just days after she posted an unapologetic video to Facebook insisting that reports of her having a relationship with McDaniel were false.

'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' 

'Priorities': She said that she had recently spoken to her daughter Anna, who accused her former boyfriend of molesting her as a child. Anna has said that Mama June did not believe her when she told her

But photographs have emerged showing evidence to the contrary, including an image of them together in bed. 

Another photograph reveals Mama June sitting on a staircase with her nine-year-old daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson behind her. McDaniel sits behind Alana, with his hand on her shoulder. 

Despite Mama June's protests, TLC announced they are cancelling the series over how she has allowed contact between McDaniel and her children. 

The concerns come just months after McDaniel was released from his 10-year prison stint for aggravated child molestation - a charge relating to Mama June's oldest daughter, Anna.

A sickening police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work.

She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel, the report shared by RadarOnline reveals.

She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not.

The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002 but it took Anna months to speak out because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told,RadarOnline reported. 

'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.'

Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.'

According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Anna's younger sister Lauryn - then just three - was beside her in the bed on at least one occasion.  

Sickening: Mark McDaniel, pictured, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child molestation. Anna said he repeatedly abused her in 2002 and threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone

In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. 

He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. 

McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. 

Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her.

'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, "I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?"' she remembered.

'And I was like, "Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work".' 

Out and about: Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson was seen out with her sister Lauryn on Tuesday

Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child

McDaniel is not the only sex offender Mama June has dated.

She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon.

After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry.

According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge.

The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.
