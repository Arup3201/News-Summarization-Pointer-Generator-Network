They are often criticised for what some deem to be their over-the-top fashion sense.

But last night Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie did not put a well-shod foot wrong as they arrived for a private party at Chelsea's Crosby Hall looking catwalk ready.

The young royals both chose brightly coloured dresses that fitted their figures perfectly. For Beatrice, a screen-printed mini dress that revealed toned legs.

For Eugenie, a vivid coral dress with cap sleeves, a fitted waistline and a deep V-neckline, all of which served to enhance her petite hourglass figure.

Stylish: Often criticised for their over-the-top fashion choices, at a party in Chelsea last night the girls looked glamorous in simple dresses with classic accessories

Tracey Emin was present at the party too, arriving in a Union flag dress, thought to be designed by Vivienne Westwood, which she paired with a pair of classic Vivienne Westwood moulded toe shoes.

The party was also attended by Pippa 
Middleton and her brother James, who were forced to cut short their day in the 
royal box at Wimbledon in order to attend.

The Middletons' early exit from the 
tennis tournament meant that they missed Rafa Nadal's incredible defeat by Czech player Lukas Rosol after the game ran until almost 10pm.

Colour matching: Beatrice picked out the colours of her dress with midnight blue clutch and sandals, while Eugenie accessorised hers just as the Queen herself would - with black bag and shoes

Spectacular venue: The party took place in Crosby Hall, a Grade II -listed property on Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. It is the only surviving part of the mansion of Crosby Hall,Â  built in 1466 by wool merchant John Crosby

The simple silhouettes were a savvy 
choice for the girls, both of whom have very good figures, but who often fail to show them off to their best advantage.

Instead of wearing figure-skimming clothes like these that enhance the body, the girls often end up in too-tight pencil skirts that appear to be stretched across their thighs, making them look bigger than they are.

The warm weather was a blessing, and meant the girls left their jackets at home. Too often they wear boxy jackets that add bulk, or button up too tightly across their bodies. A touch looser is better - strained buttons or stretched fabric adds pounds that aren't there.

Royal blush: Nice dresses, but both girls could have done with a touch more make up

Beatrice's 
high hemline showed off great legs honed from running, while Eugenie's vintage-style tailoring showed 
off the fact that the royal's waist is in fact tiny - something that is 
sometimes lost when the princesses wear badly fitting clothing.

The only negative? Eugenie's hair is crying out for some volume - someone give that girl some rollers. And both, but especially Eugenie, could do with more make up. A bold pink lip, some blusher, bronzer and mascara would take Eugenie, who has beautiful bone structure, from dressed-up teen to elegant princess.

Her black shoes, too are a tad heavy for summer, and for the bright dress they accompany - but we'd take them over the dreadful standard-issue nude pumps the female royals can't get enough of any day.
