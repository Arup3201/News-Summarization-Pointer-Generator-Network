England had a really good day, chipping away on a flat pitch and taking regular wickets to keep alive hopes of a series-levelling win.

It was not the sort of surface where you could blast out the opposition, not the pitch we expected, but the one thing that has kept England interested is a bit of swing which keeps Jimmy Anderson in the game.

Just as the senior batsmen responded in this third Test with runs for Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, so the experienced bowlers in Anderson and Stuart Broad were brilliant on Tuesday. 

Bad day at the office: Chris Jordan struggled against India on day three of the third Test in Southampton

Stick with him: England selectors must keep faith in Chris Jordan or risk ruining his confidence

The way they kept going and found the right lengths was outstanding and Cook used them well. Chris Jordan had a bad day but the England selectors must not go back to the policy of ‘in-out’ with players that was such a problem in the bad old days. They then lose confidence and rhythm and don’t know if they’re coming or going.

England should have made a decision between Jordan and Ben Stokes at the start of this summer and stuck by it. What do they do at Old Trafford? Leave Jordan out and bring Stokes back?

Jordan has a few technical issues but they were there before and he needs to bowl and bowl. He has a bit of a jerky action, as well as this quirk with his thumb across the seam and three fingers on the ball.

He’s got things that can go wrong and then finds himself in trouble.

Bring on the big guns: James Anderson and Stuart Broad (R) stepped up to give England hope of levelling

If you’re out of form as a batsman you can nick it and walk off but if you’re a bowler you have to stay out there and work through it.

The fact we didn’t mention Jos Buttler much throughout the day suggests the debutant kept well, and Jordan certainly tested him with a few down the leg side. The catch on the leg side that should have been given off Moeen Ali was an impressive one, too.

Moeen, meanwhile, keeps chipping in with wickets and coach Duncan Fletcher will be fuming about the way India gifted England a wicket either side of tea. It’s as if India are not sure whether to block Moeen or try to blast him out of the attack.

Chris Woakes was OK in the Tim Bresnan role but that only works if you have a spinner who can contain and attack, and without that you have to ask whether England have picked their best seamers here. Liam Plunkett or Steven Finn could have given them more wicket-taking potential.

Cook had a good day, highlighted by him having mid-on and mid-off up to Rohit Sharma. It would have been easy to drop long-off back but he tempted Rohit into the shot which got him out and that was promising.

I would have liked to see a gully employed more often but to have India 323 for eight on a flat pitch was a fine effort from the captain and his senior bowlers.
