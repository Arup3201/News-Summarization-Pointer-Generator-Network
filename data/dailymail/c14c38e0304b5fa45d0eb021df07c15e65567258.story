Murdered: The body of Janet Gilson was in the bottom of her niece's sofa four days after she was reported missing while on holiday in Hong Kong

A murdered former Salvation Army worker was found dead inside a sofa after her family noticed drops of her blood on the floor, an inquest has heard.

Janet Gilson, 64, was strangled days after she arrived on holiday in Hong Kong after travelling there to visit relatives.

Ms Gilson, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was missing for four days before family members spotted blood on the floor close to a sofa.

They called police who found her body hidden in a hole cut out of the bottom of the piece of furniture, Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard.

Ms Gilson was reported missing on March 15 2011 having arrived in the Far East 10 days earlier.

But it wasn't until March 19 that her body was found at the home of her niece Julia in Lamma.

A post-mortem confirmed that Ms Gilson had died of suffocation, but coroner Yvonne Blake refused to read out further details of the report because it was deemed 'too distressing' for family and friends who had attended the inquest to hear.

She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, adding: 'I understand Janet Gilson was a Salvation Army worker who did a lot of good work.

'It is very tragic her life was taken in this way.'

Speaking after the inquest, Ian Payne, 55, a former Salvation Army officer from Bromley who attended with his wife Judith, paid tribute to his friend and colleague.

He said: 'Janet was one of those one in a million people.

'She had a unique ability to connect with people and had a huge impact on all our lives.

'It is difficult to put into words all her good qualities.

'She was the true embodiment of what a Christian should be.

'We went to Hong Kong for the trial - in some ways today gives us a sense of closure but she will always be a part of our lives.'

Grim discovery: The body of Major Gilson, 64, was found hidden at her niece's home in Lamma, the third largest island in Hong Kong, in March 2011

Janet set up one of Russia’s first ever Salvation Army churches after travelling alone to the outskirts of Moscow and learning the language in the early 90s.

Throughout her 40-year career with the Salvation Army she also worked with teenagers in England and Ireland.

She had retired shortly before leaving for Hong Kong.

Ahmed Fareed, reportedly the ex-husband of Ms Gilson's neice, was found guilty of the murder at the High Court in Lamma in June this year and jailed for life.

The court had heard that she had been strangled with a rope and was found with a towel stuffed in her mouth and four broken ribs.

Fareed, from the Maldives, was arrested at Hong Kong’s ferry harbour shortly after the murder.

Following the court case, Ms Gilson’s niece, Julia, told the South China Morning Post: 'To those people that are in relationships with violent partners: I strongly urge you to get away.

'I made the mistake of believing I could help change my ex-husband, giving him many chances.

'I realise the error of that judgment now and hope that others can also learn from that.'
