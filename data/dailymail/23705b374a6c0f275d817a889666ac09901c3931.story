Antonio Conte has left as Juventus manager by mutual consent after four years in charge of the club.

The 44-year-old leaves the Old Lady after guiding them to three successive Serie A titles.

The Italian, who captained the club during his playing career, also led the Turin outfit to a record points haul of 102 points as they won their 30th official league title.

The announcement was made on Juventus' website, in a shock move just as the Italian club begins preparations for next campaign.

There had been speculation toward the
 end of last season that Conte wanted to leave but then he had 
appeared to change his mind.

He had one year remaining on his contract with Juventus but announced his decision to leave via a video message on the club's website.

'I have decided to terminate my contract with Juventus,' he said.

'I have matured with time and my feelings led me to make this choice. It may be more difficult to keep winning with Juventus.

'An enormous thank you for what you have given to me as a player and as a coach. I have always been close to you. I want to say that the journey taken in recent years has been historic.

'Winning is difficult. It comes with a lot of effort, especially in a club like Juventus where there is the obligation of victory, but I showed I'm a winner.'

While the job of Italy national team coach is open after Cesare Prandelli resigned following the Azzurri's group stage exit from the World Cup, Conte wouldn't give any clues to his next move.

'Right now I'm thinking about the present and the decision taken,' he added.

Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon called it 'a serious loss' and had no explanation for the coach's move but suggested the departure will not greatly affect the squad's performance.

'We've lost a great coach but great players and a smart club remain in place,' the goalkeeper said.

'Now we need to stay together even more and show what we're worth, disregarding Conte.'

President Andrea Agnelli delivered a passionate tribute to Conte, thanking him for his time at the helm of the club.

'Dear Antonio, you have been a great leader and this news saddens me greatly,' he wrote on Juve's official site.

'Three years together have led us to write history with three consecutive titles and two Italian cups.

'You have given a group of highly talented professionals who will be at the disposal of the new coach to continue writing the future.

'You are in the history of the Bianconeri colours and whatever choice you make, a Juventus victory will always make you smile.

'Antonio, thank you for everything. Til the end.'

Captain fantastic: Conte (left) played over 500 appearances for Juventus as a player, winning five league titles

Conte, a former Italy international, joined Juve from Siena in 2011 and returned to Turin to a fanfare owing to his standing as one of the club's greatest ever players. He made over 500 appearances in black and white and won five league titles.

That Midas touch continued as he won Serie A at the first attempt with his side going unbeaten throughout the league season.

A second title duly followed but the summer of 2013 saw him embroiled in a corruption row after he was charged with failing to report attempted match-fixing during his time with Siena.

Conte pleaded innocence but was banned for 10 months - a sentence reduced to a four-month touchline suspension last August.

Conte signed a new deal through to the summer of 2015 earlier this year but now appears to be the man destined to fill Prandelli's shoes in charge of the Italian national side.

He leaves amid fevered speculation regarding the future of key players Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal.

Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini and ex-AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri are already being linked with his position at Juventus.
