An elderly zookeeper was ripped to pieces and eaten by his own tigers when he went to feed them.

Mauro Lagiard, 72, was attacked from behind as he entered the enclosure at a closed-down zoo, near Turin, in northern Italy.

In a horrific scene he was dragged 100ft while his wife watched helplessly from outside the cage.

His dismembered body was later found by the tigers' water trough, police said.

Mr Lagiard and his wife had cared for the tigers since the small animal sanctuary was closed down in 2010 at the peak of the economic crisis.

The couple lived on site near the tigers’ enclosure in a camper van.

The retired zoo keeper was ‘utterly fearless’ and devoted to the animals according to reports in the Italian media.

On Tuesday night, he went in to the cage to feed them chicken meatballs.

But this time the alpha-male, named Samir, went in for the kill quickly followed by two others in the pack.

Five recently born cubs watched hungrily from the sidelines.

The elderly keeper was dragged through the dirt to a clearing and torn to pieces.

After hearing desperate screams his wife Carla called for medics.

But the 73-year-old, who walked with the help of two sticks, was powerless to come to her husband's aid and could only watch in agony from outside the cage.

Even after the ambulance arrived it was half an hour before the medics could get close to him.

The tiger that attacked first was the one he loved the most, according to reports, even though the same animal had attacked him before two years ago causing him to spend eight months in hospital.

At the time the faithful owner blamed himself, saying he was wearing aftershave which had confused the animal. It was a miracle’ that he had survived, he said.

Even yesterday Mrs Lagiard still refused to blame the tigers, telling reporters: ‘My husband and Samir did not get on. If I had gone it would never have happened.’ 

But neighbours said the animals were malnourished and aggressive. They were fed just twice a week.

The couple had always been big cat lovers and originally kept both tigers and leopards at a villa outside Turin where they had a big garden.

After problems with neighbours they were evicted and the cats were almost put down.

But at the last minute the owner of an animal sanctuary called the Martinat Oasis came to their rescue offering them space at his park.

The tourists would be able to see the tigers but the couple had to take care of their maintenance themselves, he said.

George Martinat said that he had taken them in because he had sympathised with their plight.

He told Italian newspaper la Stampa: ’They said that the animals were their lives.

‘Even though they were elderly and physically debilitated, I did not want to be responsible for separating them from their animals.’ 

A keeper who had worked at the animal sanctuary said Mr Lagiard was ‘very sure of himself.’ 

He told the newspaper la Repubblica: ‘He never took any precautions. He went in, he gave them their food and he left. He had no fear, even though in the past he had been attacked by the same tigers.’ 

Then in 2010 mounting bills and dwindling numbers of visitors forced the closure of the zoo.

New homes were found for the animals. The only ones to stay were the tigers, as well as one old leopard, now 24 years old.

The couple had continued to care for them with love and a few families continued to trickle up the hill to see the big cats.

But local residents and animal activists were concerned by the keepers’ advancing age and the aggressive nature of the tigers, who appeared skinny and malnourished.

After the first attack on Mr Lagiard two years ago many believed the animals were dangerous.

A few months ago five tiger cubs were born bringing the total number of tigers to feed to ten.

Finally, last week Mr Lagiard was asked to meet the mayor but the council was struggling to find a suitable home for the animals.

They are currently in the care of vets while their fate is decided. Samir is likely to be put down, according to reports.
