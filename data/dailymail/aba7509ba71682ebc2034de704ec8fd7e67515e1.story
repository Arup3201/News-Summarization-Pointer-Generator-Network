Nice guy image: Jamie Oliver closed two Recipease stores without giving employees any notice

Jamie Oliver has closed two of his cooking class shops - but failed to tell staff until they were abruptly cleared out of the premises during a shift.

Customers with bookings were also not informed of the sudden decision, and many found out just days before their classes were meant to take place after ringing up to ask for directions or confirmation.  

The star chef shut down his Recipease branches in Clapham Junction and Brighton after five years of operation - with a spokesman claiming they were now 'focusing energies on their flagship Notting Hill branch'.

But one customer, who called the business to complain about a cancelled booking, says a despondent former employee  temporarily posted to customer services admitted the stores were 'making no money'.

Another former worker at the Brighton store has labelled the move 'heartless and shameful'.

The part-time employee, a student who did not want to be named, claims a woman from head office came in to the store to close the place down - and customers and staff had to leave the premises immediately.

He told MailOnline: 'They literally just came in at lunch, kicked out customers, shut the doors and hey presto. It was one lady from London head office.

'Our food champs were renowned for there incredible work and classes.

'To be just sacked off just like that. Shameful, as if he couldn't afford to keep us open a few more weeks so we could have a proper send off. 

'I was offered one week's wages, woopey do! Very heartless thing to do considering our loyalty and hard work towards the company.

'The worst part is not even being able to thank regulars for their custom face to face. Instead having a "poster in the window" job.' 

Another member of staff, from the Clapham Junction store, claimed she turned up to work last Monday to find the doors locked and said workers were appalled by the last-minute decision.

The Recipease stores were opened in 2009 to create ‘buzzing little community hubs where people can really get involved with food’.

Classes at the shop can cost up to £65 for a two-hour session, teaching a range of varying cuisines from Mexican street food to Christmas mince pies. 

The chain has been inundated with angry and disappointed messages on Twitter from customers who have seen their plans ruined by the sudden closures.

One, Nick Phipps, wrote: 'Email to say you're closed 4 days before my course isn't good enough! Hotel and time off work booked, now wasted...'

Another, Cicely Milsom, posted: 'We were so excited for class nxt wknd! Disappointed at short notice cancelation and unapologetic customer service!'

Aude Eberlin wrote: '@Recipease Brighton closed down with no notification for people who booked! Thanks for ruining 11 people's day! #fail #nothappy.'

And Becky Jacques tweeted the celebrity chef directly saying: 'Cancelled cooking lesson @jamieoliver in Brighton this weekend = hen do disaster. Help a desperate bridesmaid out pls?! Private lesson?!'

The Recipease website recently posted a message entitled ‘Goodbye Clapham and Brighton’. It reads: ‘We are sorry to say that we have decided to close our sites in both Clapham Junction and Brighton.'

A spokesman for Jamie Oliver's company today confirmed that workers had not been given advance warning of the decision, saying: 'I'm told no-one turned up to find the doors closed but yes staff did find out on the day of closure.'

'Obviously it was a very difficult decision to close the stores. A consultation process has already begun with Recipease staff affected and we have found alternative employment within the business for many of them.'

'As for the customers affected, although there is understandable disappointment, all are in the process of being reimbursed or their classes moved to the flagship Notting Hill Recipease.'

Despite the TV chef's previous successes and celebrity status, this is not the first time this year that Mr Oliver's multi-million-pound business empire has run into difficulties.

Back in January, his company announced the closure of three out of his four 'Union Jacks' restaurants - which were aimed at 'bringing back nostalgic British classics' such as fish and chips, and bangers and mash.

The firm cited the 'challenging climate' for the decision to close the restaurant branches in Holborn and Chiswick in London and Winchester in Hampshire with immediate effect.

January's announcement followed the failure of his artisan food range, Jme, which folded amid poor sales and criticism over prices at the end of 2013.

The TV chef is thought to be worth around £240million.

After leaving school at 16 years old with just two GCSEs, Jamie Oliver has built a £240million business empire and is one of the most recognised chefs in the world. Here are some of his biggest hits, along with a few of his recent failures.
