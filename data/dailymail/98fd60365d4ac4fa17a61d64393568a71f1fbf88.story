Eight days is a long time in rugby and Saracens showed on Saturday that they had put last Friday’s crushing defeat by Bath behind them with a performance which occasionally hinted at a return to their best.

Mark McCall’s men were slow out of the blocks before hitting their straps midway through the second half to ease home with something to spare.

Tom Savage’s 80th-minute try for the visitors put some gloss on the scoreboard and secured a losing bonus-point, but Saracens had this match wrapped up from the moment Chris Ashton powered over for a try midway through the second half.

‘I thought we bounced back really well,’ said Saracens director of rugby McCall. ‘When you lose like that to Bath the important thing to understand is why you were beaten and why you didn’t get the performance you wanted.

‘It’s important not to overreact or under-react and get to the nub of the problem. I think we’ve been ok at doing that over the past couple of seasons.’

The game was always engaging and, with the artificial Allianz Park pitch set to stand up to whatever the English winter throws at it, Saracens fans can expect more good-quality rugby as the season progresses. 

In the week that Wasps confirmed their intention to move to Coventry, last season’s beaten Premiership finalists attracted more than 9,000 fans to a ground they purchased just two years ago.

As the only remaining Premiership club with a London postcode, Saracens’ marketing men are already licking their lips at the prospect of luring in a tranche of disillusioned Wasps fans ready to consume regular top-flight rugby but unwilling to travel a 150-mile round trip in order to do so.

For the time being, Saracens will refrain from making overtures towards the disaffected but the intention is to move in on their rival’s former territory. ‘How long do you have to wait after someone has died until you can ask to buy the contents of their wardrobe?’ one source asked before kick-off.

But while Wasps’ London future may be terminal, there remains plenty of life in Saracens. With the deepest pockets in the league and one of the biggest squads, the men in black have reason to be optimistic as they head towards Europe with centre Brad Barritt fit and firing again and Owen Farrell also set to return against Clermont next Saturday.

Barritt was outstanding yesterday. The No12 got the better of his opposite number Billy Twelvetrees — who started strongly before fading like the rest of his team — and McCall was full of praise.

‘Brad was a real pillar with the ball and was outstanding,’ said McCall. ‘People underestimate Brad. They think he’s a one trick pony and just defends. But there’s much more to his game. Without question he’s the most competitive person I have come across. I’d have him in my international team every day of the week.’

Captain Alistair Hargreaves, one of three Saracens’ try scorers along with Ashton and Chris Wyles, also impressed, while Charlie Hodgson kicked two conversions and two penalties as the home side overturned a 13-3 deficit to win at a canter.

Greig Laidlaw kicked 11 points for Gloucester while Rob Cook scored a try before Savage’s late effort. But the visitors were off the pace in the second half and deservedly lost prop Nick Wood to the sin bin after 57 minutes.

‘Saracens showed why they’re a champion team,’ said Gloucester boss David Humphreys.
