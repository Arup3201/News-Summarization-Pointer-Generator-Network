These eerie pictures of abandoned asylums, prisons and schools give a glimpse into what life was like in these places in 20th Century America.

The images were captured by British photographer, Daniel Barter, 30, and show how these institutions had bowling alleys, theatres, and even hairdressing salons.

Mr Barter, from London, was travelling through Americaâ€™s north eastern states when he had the chance to explore the derelict public buildings left untouched since they were closed down.

He also found churches filled with junk and hotels where no-one had disturbed the dust for decades.

But his adventures weren't without an element of danger. 'Urban exploration' involves trespass which in the United States is a criminal offence and his 5,000 mile road trip with fellow photographer Dan Marbaix often left him in areas considered unsafe.

Mr Barter said: 'We visited five states and several major cities, from New York City to Pittsburgh. It got pretty wild at times, so much so that in the more destitute areas, our guide carried a Glock.'
