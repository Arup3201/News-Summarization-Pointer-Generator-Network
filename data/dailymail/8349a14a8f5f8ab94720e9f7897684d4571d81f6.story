A business owner has been sentenced to two years in jail for setting his own shop on fire in Sydney's west.

Chadi Jomaa, 38, was seen walking around outside the grocery shop before it caught alight in October 2013.

In CCTV footage aired on 9News, the father-of-six is seen wearing a black hoodie, grey shorts and white sneakers as he drops something on the ground just moments before the building in Wentworthville explodes. 

Chadi Jomaa had to be rescued by emergency services and eight police officers were injured

The materials he used to set the shop alight were petrol and a set of matches, The Daily Telegraph reported.

A blinding light fills up the frame as chunks of debris is blown across the footpath and onto the street.

Then a man - who lived in the apartment above the uninsured store - is shown crawling on his hands and knees to safety, narrowly escaping being buried beneath the rubble.

But Jomaa was not so lucky. 

Eight police officers were injured while trying to rescue him.

On Tuesday, he was sentenced to two years, non-parole prison time with the judge saying it was a 'shocking case of being caught red-handed'.

His wife, Jasmine, and children were at Parramatta District Court to hear the outcome.

As they left court, Ms Jomaa was asked by 9News how she felt when she saw the shocking footage of the explosion.

She replied: 'I am going to support my husband the whole way'.

Ms Jomaa also thanked the police and ambulance officers, firefighters, nurses, doctors and everyone else who were involved in her husband's rescue.

The court heard the father suffered from post-traumatic stress, and reported having flashbacks and headaches.

He also had a severe gambling addiction, which was a result of his time spent in the Lebanon conflict.

But the judge noted this did not excuse Jomaa's actions.

The court was told property damages from the fire amounted up to $1.3 million, News Corp reported.

Jomaa injuries from the explosion included two broken legs, injuries to his neck and pelvis, and face burns. This has resulted in him having 14 surgical procedures performed on him since the incident.
