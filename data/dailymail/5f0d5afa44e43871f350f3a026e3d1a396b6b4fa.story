Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence 
Booth's view of day two of the third Test between England and India at 
the Ageas Bowl, which saw Ian Bell score 167 to move into the top 10 England run scorers.

Ian Bell moved into the top 10 on England’s all-time run-scoring list with his sublime 167, easing out Andrew Strauss along the way. Bell now has 7,068 runs.

His 21st Test ton drew him level with Strauss, and pulled him clear of Graham Gooch and Ken Barrington.

Big hitter: Ian Bell's 167 against India took him past 7,000 Test runs

ENGLAND FINALLY CLEAR THE ROPE

Bell passed 7,000 with a straight six off Ravindra Jadeja. It was the first of six sixes England hit during the afternoon — with Bell and debutant Jos Buttler launching three each — and the first six they had managed all series. India, by contrast, managed seven sixes in the first two Tests.

ALI KNOCKED OUT BY ANOTHER BOUNCER

Fast bowlers will have taken note of Moeen Ali’s latest dismissal, caught at second slip after toe-ending an attempted pull off Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

Slowly does it! Moeen Ali has fallen to a fast bowler for the third time in this series against India

It’s the third time in the series Moeen has been undone by the bouncer, after turning his back at both Trent Bridge and Lord’s, and spooning catches off his glove.

LADY LUCK HAS SMILED ON BATSMEN

Gary Ballance was unlucky to have been given out caught behind off his hip after being beaten by an off-break from Rohit Sharma, but England have enjoyed good fortune in this Test.

Alastair Cook was dropped on 15, Bell could have been out lbw for a duck, Ballance was possibly caught behind on 10, while Buttler survived an appeal for a slip catch before he had scored.

Great escape: Gary Ballance (C) was one of several England batsmen to have decisions go their way

Ballance's innings of 156 means he has now scored 364 runs in the series at an average of 91. That is more than anyone on either side, with Indian opener Murali Vijay in second place, way behind on 328. England’s Joe Root, in third, is even further behind — on 236.

ANDERSON HOLDS INDIAN SIGN OVER DHAWANIndian opener Shikhar Dhawan was the star of the show when his team won the Champions Trophy in England last summer.

But his dismissal last night for six at the Ageas Bowl, caught at first slip by Cook off Jimmy Anderson, took his series tally to 85 runs in five knocks — and Anderson has now removed him cheaply in three first innings out of three.
