The Monarch’s favourite grocer, Fortnum & Mason, has enjoyed Royal patronage for more than 150 years.

So at first glance, the caption ‘Proud to be the queens’ grocer’ in its latest advert would appear to be proud a reference to its Royal Warrant with Buckingham Palace.

But careful readers who notice the positioning of the apostrophe will understand the slogan has a very different meaning – the store is showing its support for Britain’s  gay and lesbian community.

The notice appeared in the programme for yesterday’s Gay Pride march in London.

The cheeky play on words has received a favourable response on Twitter and other social media.

Stephen Fry, the comedian, broadcaster and gay rights campaigner, wrote: ‘See Fortnum’s advertisement for Gay Pride magazine. Note the apostrophe and that hot bit of crumpet!’

Another fan wrote: ‘Kudos to Fortnum & Mason’, and another added: ‘Brilliant Gay Pride ad from Fortnum & Mason.’

The iconic store, in London’s Piccadilly, has impeccable Royal credentials, having been founded by William Fortnum, a former footman in the Court of Queen Anne, and his landlord Hugh Mason.

The store, which opened for business in 1707, received its first Royal warrant in 1863 and has warrants with the current Queen and the Prince  of Wales dating back to 1955 and 1996 respectively.

Last night, a spokesman for Fortnum & Mason said: ‘We are proud to support Pride.’

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
