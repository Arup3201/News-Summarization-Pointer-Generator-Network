Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers put his players through an intense training session at Harvard University ahead of their second US tour match against Greek side Olympiacos on Sunday.

The Reds lost 1-0 to Roma on Thursday and the players wasted no time in getting ready for their next encounter as they were back training the following day.

Goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who spent last season on loan at Napoli, jumped over bars and trained hard despite much speculation surrounding his Anfield future.
