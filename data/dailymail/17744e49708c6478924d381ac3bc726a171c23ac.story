Married Wall Street executive Todd S. Thomson may have fathered a secret love child with classical violinist Eugenia Choi, it was revealed today.

The ex-Citigroup executive's wife Melissa is divorcing him, due in part to an incident six years ago when he famously flew CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo, on the group's private jet to an event in Asia and bankrolled $5 million to sponsor a 
Sundance special Bartiromo was supposed to host.

Court papers filed by Melissa's lawyers allege that in April of this year, her husband - now CEO of Headwaters Capital - admitted to 'a base, 
immoral and disreputable act he had committed', and that the sight of him now disgusts and traumatizes her.

The divorce papers by his wife of 25 
years demand that Choi, 36, hand over all court filings and 
correspondence about the paternity of her daughter.

Named in divorce battle: Married Wall Street executive Todd S. Thomson may have fathered a secret love child with classical violinist Eugenia Choi

Plan: Todd was served with the divorce papers in the most humiliating way possible because Melissa Thomson, second from left, wanted to cause him maximum embarrassment

According to the New York Post's Page Six, the divorce suit includes a deposition order 
for the Juilliard-educated Choi, which demands she 'produce all 
correspondence...and all court filings pertaining to the paternity, support or other 
legal issues with respect to your daughter'.

It was revealed earlier this week that 'Money Honey' Maria Bartiromo may be called as a witness in the bitter divorce battle after Melissa was granted permission by a Connecticut court to depose the 46-year-old.

'Certain facts which are in issue, or which directly assist in proving 
the Plaintiff’s case, are within the knowledge or power of [Bartiromo],' the court said.

Sources close to ­the anchor insist she has not yet been 
served with papers and has no knowledge of the battle between the estranged spouses.

Page
Six also reports that Todd was served with the divorce papers in the 
most humiliating way possible because Melissa wanted to cause him 
maximum embarrassment.

A source said: 'Todd was served with papers as he waited at the train station in 
Connecticut, with all his Wall Street peers, to make the commute into 
the city. He was furious.'

For the past six years Thomson has insisted that his relationship with Bartiromo, who is married to investor Jonathan Steinberg, was 'appropriate'.

The court has heard already that the reason for divorce is that the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably', but they have also deemed it necessary to depose classical violinist Eugenia Choi.

Incident: In 2007 Todd Thomson flew Maria Bartiromo on his corporate private jet owned by Citigroup back from a conference in Asia - a decision which was roundly criticized and was a contributing factor in his firing from Citigroup the same year

Melissa Thomson also wants to see any lists of money, gifts or even property that he may have given Choi, who is from Canada.

Indeed, Melissa Thomson wants to see receipts for dinners, hotels, travel and photographs of her estranged husband and Choi together.

In addition, she wants e-mails and itemized phone bills for their pair from 2008 to March of this year.

As part of the divorce proceedings, Melissa wants the multi-million dollar former family home in Rowayton in Connecticut and the couple have agreed to joint custody of their two youngest, Ethan, 16, and Kaela, 13.

However, Melissa wants her husband, who currently lives in Manhattan to stay away from the Connecticut home.

'The Defendant’s Todd presence causes significant stress to the Plaintiff and the minor children,' state court papers.

'The Defendant has treated and continues to treat the Plaintiff in a hostile and demeaning manner, which treatment causes the Plaintiff distress and anxiety.'
