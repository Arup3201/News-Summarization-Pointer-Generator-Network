Costa confirmed on Thursday night that the Barclays Premier League leaders had been in touch about a move to Stamford Bridge – one that the 24-year-old describes as a ‘dream’.

Chelsea are considering a double swoop for Costa and Cuadrado with Egyptian Mohamed Salah and German World Cup winner Andre Schurrle set for the Stamford Bridge exit. 

However Costa's Ukrainian employers won't allow their star player to leave on the cheap as Chelsea look to seal both transfers before the deadline on February 2.
