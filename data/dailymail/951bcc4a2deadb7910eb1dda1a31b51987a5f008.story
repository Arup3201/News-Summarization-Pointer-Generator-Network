Now he's wowing Americans as he walks through their towns and cities showing off his skills.

Augusto lives, breathes and sleeps dogs as the owner of Griffin Shepherd Kennels.

Touching on some of his trade secrets, he said: 'My dogs do this because they know me as part of the pack.

'I spend a lot of time with them. I feed them, they can sleep in my room, I exercise them. I do everything with them.

'Because of the way I train them, to them I'm the leader. In any given situation they will look at me for direction.

Fully supportive: Augusto's landlady Cynthia Dean, 55, doesn't seem to mind the abundance of animals 

Now Augusto has taken the feat to the streets of a major city - upping the stakes with six dogs on the streets of busy Boston last month.

'It's quite a different thing for the dogs because it's an environment they are not used to, with lots of noise and distractions,' he said.

'I start with the dogs on a lead so that they can get used to walking and gradually remove the leads one-by-one.

'The dogs all know they must remain in the same position and not change the formation.

'A lot of people are shocked; they can't believe that so many dogs can walk through the city in a group, off the leash.

'Some people are afraid of German Shepherds but lose that fear when they see my dogs because they can tell they are focused and well behaved.

'Overall I get a variety of different reactions from people. In general they are very impressed and it makes their day.'

Bostonian Susan Wray Danowitz, who was shopping and saw Augusto and his pack, said: 'I have two dogs that are horribly behaved and would love to have them behave like Augusto's.

On show: Augusto is seen training his six German Shepherds Griffin, Harmony, Jenna, Priscilla, Hannah and Savannah on December 19, 2014 in in Houston, Massachusetts

All in a day's work: Augusto helps train all breeds of dogs at his company, but specializes in German Shepherds

'You can tell that these dogs are amazingly well-trained.'

Augusto helps train all breeds of dogs at his company, but specializes in German Shepherds.

He said: 'We train all breed of dogs and a lot of people send them to us as puppies for training before they begin lives with their new owners.

'Some people want to get a dog that's already fully trained so the puppies live here until they're older.

'Often it's people who are afraid that they're going to fail if they get a puppy and they can't train the dog properly themselves.

'Or maybe they live in a small apartment and need their dog to have obedience training before their new family member moves in.

'Sometimes it's just people who want to enjoy a dog that is already trained.

'A lot of people like to compare me Cesar Milan, the dog whisperer from TV but I'm not. I have my own techniques.'
