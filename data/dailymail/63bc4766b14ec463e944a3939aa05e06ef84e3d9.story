 A California jury reached a mixed verdict Friday in the second round of patent infringement litigation between tech giants Apple and Samsung, awarding Apple a fraction of the amount asked of the jury while awarding an even smaller amount to Samsung's counterclaim.

The eight-person jury returned a verdict finding that Samsung had infringed on two Apple software patents, awarding the company a total of $119.6 million. The jury also found in favor of Samsung in their counterclaim, awarding them $158,400 for the infringement of one patent.

The $119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $2.2 billion in damages Apple asked of the court. It is also much less than the $930 million Apple was awarded in 2012 in the same court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Jose.

In this litigation, Apple accused Samsung of 'slavishly' lifting numerous technologies from the iPhone for use in Samsung's product line. The jury was asked to decide on five patents, deciding that all Samsung phones infringed on Apple's 'quick links' patent, while only some of Samsung's phones infringed on Apple's 'slide-to-lock' patent.

US District Judge Lucy Koh had previously ruled on a motion for summary judgment that some of Samsung's phones infringed on Apple's 'auto-correct' patent.

Two other patents, including background syncing and unified search, were not found to be infringed upon by Samsung. In addition, the jury found that Apple infringed one of Samsung's patents.

The four man, four woman jury deliberated for three days following a four week trial. At trial Apple characterized Samsung as thieves, with Apple attorney Harold McElhinny telling the court that Samsung's 'illegal strategy has been wildly successful.'

Samsung's counsel disputed this claim, arguing that Apple was simply trying to attack another nemesis, Google, by preventing the the sale of products like the Galaxy S3, which use Google's Android operating system. According to Samsung, the lawsuit was part of Apple's 'holy war' against Google, declared by the late Steve Jobs in response his belief that Android ripped off Apple's iOS.

'They want to attack Google and Android by attacking the most successful Android maker,' said attorney John Quinn in Samsung's closing arguments.

Speculation has arisen that the court's verdict proved to be favorable to both Samsung and Google. Not only did Apple again fail to obtain a court injunction preventing Samsung from selling their allegedly infringing phones in the United States, but the two patents in which Google had agreed to indemnify Samsung (the background syncing and unified search) were not found to be infringing by the jury.

Some experts claim that the jury's verdict was favorable to not only Samsung, but Google as well. Apple maintains that they are glad to prevail in the jury's verdict

The $119.6 million awarded by the jury will likely not be the final total. In a review after the verdict was returned, Apple lawyers noticed an error with the way the jury made one calculation, forgetting to assess damages for one Samsung product that was found to infringe an Apple patent.

The jury will return on Monday at 9am to assess this oversight. The additional amount the jury will add to the verdict will not change the general result of the case for Apple.

Despite the jury's award being significantly less than what they asked for, attorneys for Apple maintained satisfaction regarding winning in some capacity.

'We are grateful to the jury and the court for their service,' a representative for Apple told Re/code. 'Todayâ€™s ruling reinforces what courts around the world have already 
found: That Samsung willfully stole our ideas and copied our products. 
We are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products 
like the iPhone, which our employees devote their lives to designing and
 delivering for our customers.'

Both sides will likely file post-trial motions in the coming weeks, and may appeal the result depending on how the court rules. Samsung is still appealing the 2012 ruling in which they were ordered to pay Apple $930 million.

This litigation is the latest in an ongoing legal war the tech giants have been locked in, spanning worldwide. This verdict comes when the two have begun to experience stalling in what was unprecedented growth.

Both companies have been losing market share.  Two 
years ago, Apple and Samsung accounted for more than 55 per cent of world-wide 
smartphones shipments, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In
 the first quarter of 2104, that number has fallen to 47 per cent.

According to the study, smaller Chinese rivals upstarts such as Huawei and Lenovo have been making gains, with a Lenovo takeover of Motorola pending in several countries.
