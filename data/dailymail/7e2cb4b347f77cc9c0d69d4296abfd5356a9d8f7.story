Cat-lover Maria Harrison had no idea that her love of  furry felines would one day lead to her opening her very own cat cafe.

Ms Harrison, who owns Willows Cat Adoption Centre in South Shields, Newcastle upon Tyne, serves up coffee and cake with a side of kitten to raise much needed funds for her homeless moggies.

And her cafe is so popular that visitors have to book ahead before turning up for their 45-minute kittie catch-up.

Feline fans in the area can now pet kittens as they sip coffee and munch on homemade chocolate, sticky ginger, and cherry and walnut cake.

Ms Harrison thought of opening Willows Cat Cafe after hearing that cafes featuring cats were doing brisk business in London, New York and Tokyo.

She said: 'I knew it was popular so I thought it could definitely work.

'People may think it's unusual but for me it was a completely natural idea to bring to the shelter.

The cafe is open every Monday from 11am to 2pm. 30 to 45 minute slots are available to visitors.  

'You do need to book ahead - we have to have some sort of structure otherwise it would just be manic,' Ms Harrison said.

'We have already been open for around 12 weeks and the feedback has been brilliant. 

'Visitors have loved to see our lovely cats in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and you can see the cats enjoy it too; they love all the fuss and attention. 

'At the moment we have about 12 to 14 cats at the shelter, so the cafe is also a golden opportunity to raise funds.

'Everything we do make from the cafe goes towards vet costs and the cost of running the shelter.

'It really is unique and is a very special experience for cat lovers to just come along and see us.'

'And there has been quite an increase in adoptions, which is wonderful,' she said.

There are currently between 12 to 14 cats in the shelter. Visitors sometimes visit the centre just to have coffee with the cats 

'Me and my sister, both cat lovers just decide to come down and support the adoption centre and it's absolutely lovely,' said a visitor. 

'Even if you can't have a cat for yourself it's just nice to come down and spend a little time with the cats. It's really good fun,' she continued.  

Cat cafes first took off in Japan 10 years ago, and have since been established in areas across the UK.
