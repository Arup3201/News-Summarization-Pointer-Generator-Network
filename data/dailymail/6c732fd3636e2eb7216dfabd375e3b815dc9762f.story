Lindsey Leslie bit the victim's face and blamed the attack on 'severe PMT' 

A mother bit a woman's face in a bar in a violent vampire-like attack and blamed the horrific assault on premenstrual tension.

Lindsey Leslie attacked her boyfriend's sister in a pub in Carmarthen, Wales, when she came out of the toilet.  

The 35-year-old pushed Janey Davies's head against a jukebox before biting her on the cheek during the attack on June 21. 

She was arrested the following day after DNA swabs were taken from the victim's face. 

Pleading guilty to common assault at Llanelli Magistrates' Court, the mother-of-three said she was suffering 'severe PMT' which caused her to be 'aggressive'. 

She was given a 12-month community order with a supervision requirement, and told to attend 10 aggression management sessions. 

The court heard how Leslie threatened: 'I'm going to gouge you' as Miss Davies came out of the bathroom at the Boar's Head pub after their boyfriends had a disagreement. 

She slammed the woman's head against the a jukebox and bit her on the face. 

Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said: 'Leslie shouted “I’m going to gouge you” before biting the victim on the face. 

'Miss Davies went to the toilet and when she came back her partner said he had tried to speak to her brother and got a barrage of abuse back.

'After a quick word with her partner Leslie approached his sister. Miss Davies's head was then pushed with force against the pub jukebox.

'Miss Davies was very scared. She tried to push the defendant away and thought she was really going to hurt her. 

'Leslie was shouting in her face.

'A swab was taken of her cheek and later found to contain traces of Leslie’s DNA.'

The 35-year-old told the court she suffered severe PMT which caused her to behave aggressively 

The attack happened at the Boar's Head Pub in Carmarthen on June 21 after the women's boyfriends had a disagreement 

Leslie was given a 12-month community order and told to attend 10 aggression management courses at Llanelli Magistrates' Court 

Robyn Reed, defending, said: 'She had been diagnosed with severe PMT.

'This can cause her to be aggressive when she comes into contact with people she does not know.'

Leslie was given a 12-month community order with a supervision requirement and a requirement that she attends 10 aggression management sessions.

She was also fined £100 and ordered to pay £85 in court costs, a £60 victim surcharge and £75 in compensation to Miss Davies for the injury to her cheek.
