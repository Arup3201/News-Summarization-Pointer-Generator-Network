Worcester's fairytale FA Cup run came to an end as Scunthorpe booked their place in the third round with a nail-biting penalty shoot-out victory at Aggborough on Wednesday night.

Scunthorpe defender Miguel Llera held his nerve to seal the 14-13 shootout victory which surpassed the previous FA Cup record when Macclesfield beat Forest Green 11-10 in 2001.

Worcester's Wayne Thomas had seen his penalty saved by Sam Slocombe before Llera safely saw Scunthorpe into the third round.

Non-League Worcester earned a second-round replay against their League One opponents after a 1-1 draw at Glanford Park earlier this month.

Scunthorpe's Paddy Madden opened the scoring in first-half injury when he glanced Gary McSheffrey's corner past Nathan Vaughan to put the visitors in control.

But Worcester, who knocked out Coventry in the first round, were level again 25 minutes into the second half when Sean Geddes broke into the Scunthorpe box and poke the ball beyond Slocombe.

Neither side were able to make the breakthrough during extra-time before Scunthorpe held their nerve in an exhilarating 32-penalty shootout.

Worcester manager Carl Heeley paid tribute to his non-league stars after they were cruelly denied a place in the next round.

Heeley said: 'I'm so proud of the players - they were fantastic this evening. We took this right to the distance. I wish Scunthorpe the best of luck, but we've been outstanding.

'We've got to use this as a springboard to push us up the league and see if we can get a play-off place. We've got to produce week in, week out.

'The players have done this club proud this evening. The club has got massive potential and the sky's the limit for us. I'm a proud man tonight - the players have been superb.'

Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins siad: 'They pushed us all the way. But you're in it to win it and we ended up winning it. But I thought Worcester were magnificent, really good.

'And the penalties at the end were outstanding. We're in the next round but you've got to take your hat off to Worcester - they were magnificent. There was a lot of pressure on each penalty taker, but I'm pleased we're through.'
