Corra Connell has been living with the most devastating mystery for the last eight years.

The 30-year-old, from Geelong, Victoria, cannot move her legs, cannot use her arms and can only communicate through slow speech. Doctors are baffled and have been unable to provide a diagnosis.

But the most heartbreaking part of Corra's battle is that her illness prevents her from showing the simplest maternal instincts to her one and only child.

It all began prior to Corra's pregnancy when she began suffering from an unusually high heart rate and blurred vision, Corra's mother and carer Jen Connell said.

'It just came out of the blue and there weren't many signs leading up to it,' Ms Connell explained. 'But then five months into her pregnancy all she saw was fog and couldn't see.'

Upon visiting the eye specialist, Corra was told this was more than just her vision and was referred to a neurologist.

There were still no answers and after her daughter Kyra was born, the condition progressed to her legs.

'Corra's legs were very fatigued so she was constantly leaning on something or someone but she couldn't make it very far,' Ms Connell said.

'So I had to be with her all the time and then she had to move back in with me when Kya was about three years old.'

Just a day after her 30th birthday, Corra was taken to hospital in a critical condition

Then tremors started in Corra's hands.

'She couldn't sit up right, she lost control and just couldn't support herself,' Ms Connell said.

'So I would have to hold her up when she went to the toilet and she started using a wheel chair. But then we had to get one especially made for her because her chin would drop down.

'I'm virtually Corra's arms, legs and voice.'

While Corra still has reflexes in her body, she has been completely bedridden for the past year and feeds through a tube as she's unable to swallow.

The young mother reached a critical moment on May 31, just a day after her 30th birthday.

'She was at the edge of life or death,' Ms Connell said.

Corra was taken to hospital as she had been suffering from pneumonia.

'The doctors just told us there was nothing left for them to do,' Ms Connell said.

'They were telling us to be prepared. We even spoke with palliative care.'

Corra's condition has progressively become worse as she is now unable to use her legs, her arms and can only communicate through slow speech

Corra had to move back in with her mother Jen Connell when Kya was three-years-old

But Corra proved them wrong.

'She's always been strong and always believed that this isn't permanent,' Ms Connell said.

'We're just waiting for someone to open the door with an answer.'

While Ms Connell is a full-time carer, she tells of a mother's heartache as she's seen her second youngest daughter deteriorate each day.

'The difficulty for me is to watch her deteriorate little by little and lose her independence,' she said.

'She was a very good singer, great dancer and she was very social and outgoing. She played netball and was very active. Incredibly contrasting from her life now.'

Even the simple things in life have become part of Corra's every day struggle.

'I have to scratch her head when it's itchy or if something is in her eye I have to get it out for her,' Ms Connell said.

'But the heartbreaking thing is that she can't raise her daughter and she watches life go on. It's difficult to see that she's losing her place in life.'

Kya is waiting for the day her mum overcomes her illness and finally gets out of bed

Corra is determined to overcome her illness so she can become the mother she's always wanted to be for Kya

Incredibly, Corra remains positive despite living with the mysterious illness which has completely taken over her life.

'The doctors told us they have no answers,' Ms Connell said. 'They just hit a wall.

'But Corra is so good with dealing with it all. So she's my strength.'

And her motivation is to finally be the mother she's always wanted to be for eight-year-old daughter Kya.

'She's a beautiful girl and she's grown up very quickly,' Ms Connell said. 'But she's just hanging out for the day her mum gets out of bed. The saddest thing is that Corra can’t easily give her own daughter a hug.'

Ms Connell says they all truly believe that Corra will overcome the illness.

'Corra strongly believes that this is a journey she has to be on because there's a reason for everything and there's a purpose for what she's going through,' Ms Connell said.

'Whatever this is, it will just run its course. I don't think Corra's condition is terminal.

'So we are just waiting for a miracle.'

‘It’s often assumed that with our 
increased understanding of medicine and progress with genome sequencing, a diagnosis will simply pop up,' Alastair Kent OBE, director of Genetic Alliance UK told MailOnline.

The charity, along with its sub-section called SWAN UK - Syndromes Without A Name - offers support and information to families of children with undiagnosed conditions.

Mr Kent added: 'However it is surprisingly difficult in many cases to make a diagnosis – we estimate that in the UK alone, there are at least 5,000 families who have a child with an undiagnosed condition. 

‘It can be incredibly frustrating and stressful – these people often have a cocktail of difficult problems and their lives are hanging by a thread. They have also been through countless tests which often conclude there are ‘no abnormalities’.

‘That doesn’t mean there’s nothing wrong – it means we don’t understand the significance of these results.

Sometimes you get a lot of data but not a huge amount of information. For a diagnosis, you need a previous example to compare it with. Without that, how do you know it’s the same thing? ‘Rare diseases - often caused by
 extremely rare genetic mutation - are defined as medical 
conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people (this is the number the EU uses).

The National Institues of Health in the U.S has recently established the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) to help diagnose rare and new diseases and treat those with rare disorders.

Dr Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, told NBC News:  ‘To date, researchers have discovered the
 genomic bases of more than 5,000 rare genetic disorders, but we are 
still on the hunt for the cause of an additional 2,000-3,000 
single-gene, also called Mendelian, disorders.’
