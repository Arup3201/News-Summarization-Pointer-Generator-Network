It should be a no-brainer but then the same ought to have applied to the Liverpool Lip learning his lesson.

Surely Colombia, complete with the luxurious skills of new kid on the World Cup block James Rodriguez, will beat Uruguay, minus the penetration of bitter old Luis Suarez.

That is what pretty much everyone except Suarez’s countrymen seem to want the outcome to be on this first day of the round of the last 16.

While Suarez left the revulsion of Brazil 2014 for a warped hero’s welcome in Montevideo, the Maracana was making ready to admire the refreshing Colombians.

But there is a danger here.

A bunker mentality often wins football matches and no team is more huddled together against the outside world than Uruguay.

In fact that entire South American country is shutting out criticism of Suarez the serial biter. Even their president is rallying behind him despite it being this man himself – not the English media, a FIFA conspiracy or anything else they care to blame – who has shot his team in the foot.

How will the players he has left behind react? If they feel sorry for themselves, they will be soft pickings for Colombia. But the indications are that they are angry about their star striker being expelled from the tournament and are bristling to make a statement.

It could be ugly.

There are times when there is a sinister side to Uruguay. Their best teams – starting with the two-time World Cup winners back in the 1950s – create beautiful memories. But when it goes against them they can, as Suarez so sharply demonstrates, leave a sour taste in the mouth.

Either way, they are never easy meat.

Colombia are one of the pleasant surprises here. Their attacking football has captured the imagination. Young Rodriguez is an international legend in the making and it helps that he has Jackson Martinez to help carry the goalscoring burden.

Teofilio Gutiierrez is not too shabby, either. But they should take nothing for granted.

If ever there will be a moment for Edinson Cavani to explain to a wider audience outside France why Paris St Germain invested a fortune in him, this is it.

Cavani, with his flamboyant style, often flatters to deceive but Uruguay need him to fill the goal void now.

The  enforced absence of Suarez also gives veteran forward Diego Forlan another day in the World Cup sunshine.

The Latin Americans, as usual when the World Cup is played on this continent, have been prospering but one of them has to go out.

It is worth Colombia reminding themselves that Uruguay were deeply unimpressive in qualifying, reaching Brazil only courtesy of a ridiculously easy play off against Jordan.

Hindsight tells us, also, that the group in which they defeated both England and Italy was nothing like as strong as we fondly imagined. 

Costa Rica are living proof of that.

The grand stage of the Maracana is set for Rodriguez to give most of the world what it wants from this match. But with Uruguay in this defiant mood, the 22-year-old prodigy must not expect a gentle ride.
