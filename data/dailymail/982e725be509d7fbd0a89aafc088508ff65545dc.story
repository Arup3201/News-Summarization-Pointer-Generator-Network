On yet another victorious night for  Barcelona, Neymar did not have the best display for Luis Enrique's men after missing a penalty during his side's 3-1 victory against Villarreal in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final. 

The Barca star, however, was back in action on Thursday to front the Police eyewear campaign. The brand ambassador, who also fronted the spring/summer 2015 sunglasses campaign, was on hand to model the 'sleek, key, urban eyewear'. 

With Barca leading Villareal 3-1 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique, the Catalan giants were awarded a penalty following Mateo Musacchi's handball.

All that was left was Barca's penalty specialist Lionel Messi to step up and convert the spot-kick only for Neymar to be handed the job instead. 

The Brazilian stepped up and took the kick only to see his effort saved by Villareal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo.

The miss mattered little, however, as Barca recorded their 10th consecutive triumph in all competitions.
