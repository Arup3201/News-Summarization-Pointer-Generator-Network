David Cameron was yesterday seen in public with Andy Coulson for the first time since the former spin doctor’s arrest.

Mr Coulson, who has been charged in connection with alleged perjury, chatted to the Prime Minister at the Cornbury Music Festival in Oxfordshire – one of the summer highlights for the ‘Chipping Norton set’.

The encounter at the site at Great Tew, close to Chipping Norton was described by onlookers as ‘brief’.

Rebekah Brooks, a friend of the Prime Minister, was also seen at the second day of the annual music and arts extravaganza which has been running for nine years in the Oxfordshire countryside.

The former Sun editor, and her husband Charlie, stand accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in relation to the investigation into the phone hacking scandal. Both have denied wrong-doing in a public statement.

Mr Cameron and wife Samatha walked around the festival site at about 5pm, eventually bumping into the former tabloid editor who he had appointed and later resigned after the phone hacking scandal broke.

Headline acts at this year's event included Jools Holland, Alison Moyet, Marc Almond and Elvis Costello.

Welsh singer Charlotte Church made a brief appearance on stage on Friday evening but had to rush away from the site after her daughter Ruby, three, suddenly fell ill and developed a high temperature.

Medics at the site examined the young girl and advised Charlotte and her new boyfriend to take the child straight to hospital by car.

Andy Coulson and Mr Cameron exchanged brief words as they bumped into each other, the PM with Samantha on his arm, before they went their separate ways.

Along with fellow Chipping Norton Set members Rebekah Brooks and Jeremy Clarkson, they live within a short distance of the Cornbury Festival site.

Andy Coulson has vowed to 'vigorously contest' perjury allegations if they are ever brought to trial.

Strathclyde Police charged him over allegations he lied on oath during 
the perjury trial of disgraced Scottish socialist politician Tommy 
Sheridan in 2010.
