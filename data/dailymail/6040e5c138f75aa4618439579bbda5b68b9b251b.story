A compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of Parkinson's disease, researchers believe

A damp, mouldy house has long been known to trigger asthma and allergies - and new research has now linked it to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease.

Scientists found a compound emitted by mould can be linked to the development of the neurological condition.

The U.S. researchers found a connection between the compound given off by mould and mildew - a vapour known as 'mushroom alcohol'  – and the malfunctioning of two genes associated with the brain chemical dopamine.

This is lost in patients with Parkinson's disease.

While the condition has previously been linked to exposure to toxins, these were man-made rather than natural chemicals, said researcher Dr Arati Inamdar, from Rutgers University.

The idea for the research came from the study's co-author Dr Joan Bennett, also from Rutgers University, who became interested in the health effects of living in a damp building after her house was flooded when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005.

After her house flooded it became riddled with moulds and Dr Bennett started to collect samples wearing protective clothing.

She said: ‘I felt horrible – headaches, dizziness, nausea. I knew something about “sick building syndrome” but until then I didn’t believe in it. 

‘I didn’t think it would be possible to breathe in enough mould spores to get sick.’

As a result of this experience, Dr Bennett decided to investigate the connection between moulds and the symptoms she had experienced.

She and Dr Inamdar discovered that the volatile organic compound 1-octen-3-ol, otherwise known as mushroom alcohol, can cause movement disorders in fruit flies.

Researchers found a connection between a compound - popularly known as mushroom alcohol - and the malfunctioning of two genes involved in the packaging and transport of dopamine, the chemical released by nerve cells to send messages to other nerve cells in the brain.

They also found that it attacks the 
two genes that deal with dopamine, degenerating the neurones and causing
 Parkinson’s-like symptoms. 

Parkinson's
 disease occurs when the nerve cells in the brain that make dopamine are
 slowly destroyed. Without dopamine, the nerve cells in that part of the
 brain cannot properly send messages.

It is a progressive disease of the nervous 
system marked by tremor, muscular rigidity and slow, imprecise movement.

Many people with Parkinson's also suffer from depression, daytime sleepiness and difficulty swallowing.

There is no cure for the condition but there are some drug treatments which can be beneficial temporarily.

About one in 500 people develop Parkinson's disease and there are currently 127,000 people in the UK with the condition.

The average age for the symptoms to develop is about 60, although one in 20 cases first develop in people under the age of 50.

Men are one and a half times more likely to get Parkinson's than women.

White people are much more likely to get it than black and Asian people.

Studies
 indicate that the condition - a progressive disease of the nervous 
system marked by tremor, muscular rigidity and slow, imprecise movement -
 is increasing in rural areas, where it’s usually attributed to 
pesticide exposure.

But rural environments also have a lot of mould and mushroom exposure.

‘Our work suggests that 1-octen-3-ol might also be connected to the disease, particularly for people with a genetic susceptibility to it,’ Dr Inamdar said. ‘We’ve given the epidemiologists some new avenues to explore.’

Claire Bale, Research Communications Manager at Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘Understanding what causes Parkinson’s remains one of the big unanswered questions for researchers today.

‘We already know that exposure to some chemicals can slightly increase the risk of Parkinson's, and this is the first study to suggest that chemicals produced by fungi may play a part in what causes the condition to develop. 

‘It is important to remember this study was conducted using tiny fruit flies, so before we can really be confident about this new connection we need to see evidence from studies in people.

‘Whilst exposure to chemicals produced by fungi – and possibly other chemicals – may play a role in Parkinson's in some people, it's likely just a small part of a much bigger puzzle and we wouldn’t want people to worry unnecessarily about developing the condition if they found mold or fungi in their homes.

‘We still don't know exactly what causes Parkinson's – for most people it's likely to be a combination of natural ageing, genetic susceptibility, lifestyle and environmental factors.’

The findings, which were produced with help from researchers at Emory University, were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the study was funded by Rutgers University and the National Institutes of Health.
