The Ice Bucket Challenge has become so popular that arguably the world's greatest ever player, Diego Maradona, has had a go.

The Argentina legend, who starred for Barcelona and Napoli during his illustrious playing career, uploaded a video of himself undertaking the chilly task to his official Facebook page.

Those who have a bucket of icy water tipped over their head are required to nominate three others to do the same and Maradona was no different.

Next up: Maradona has surprisingly nominated Hollywood actress Julia Roberts

The 53-year-old opted for former Brazil rival Rivelino, famous Uruguayan football commentator Victor Hugo Morales and Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts.

Whether Hollywood star Roberts takes up Maradona's challenge, which aims to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), remains to be seen.

The former Argentina boss becomes the latest in a long line of players and managers to complete the ice bucket challenge, with Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho among those to have shown their support.
