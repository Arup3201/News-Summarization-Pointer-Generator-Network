Bank of England governor Mark Carney last night dismissed proposals to cap bankers’ bonuses as ‘crude’ measures that will fail.

He said it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high-flying executives.

His comments came amid speculation that the Royal Bank of Scotland wants to give senior staff bonuses worth twice their salaries.

Mark Carney: The Bank of England chief says a bonus cap won't cut pay packages as it would simply prompt lenders to push up basic pay as they sought to keep hold of high-flying executives

And it is an embarrassing blow to Ed Miliband after Labour yesterday called on the Government to reject any request to pay higher bonuses at RBS – which is still partly taxpayer-owned.

A new bonus cap introduced this year by Brussels restricts banks in the EU from paying more than one year’s salary as a bonus, rising to two times salary if shareholders approve.

Mr Carney, who did not mention RBS by name, told MPs yesterday that he ‘absolutely’ agreed that the ‘crude bonus cap’ proposal backed by Labour was not the best way to rein in excessive pay.

He said that after making ‘many 
mistakes’ over pay and bonuses in the years leading up to the financial 
crisis the UK now has now developed a ‘hard touch’ approach.

Giving
 evidence to the Treasury select committee, he said capping bonuses 
would push up basic pay as banks attempted to keep hold of its most 
highly prized staff.

The Governor said the move would undermine efforts to ensure that large amounts of pay in the form of bonuses were deferred for five years or longer, paid in shares rather than cash, and were able to be clawed back if things went wrong.

‘It takes back some of the advantages of the approach that we have had because it will incentivise more cash compensation today – exactly the type of problem we had before – that we can’t claw back,’ MPs were told.

‘We would rather see more deferral, more equity [share-based payout] and this ability to take it back when those risks come to light.’

Chancellor George Osborne said: ‘These European rules will not lead to bankers being paid less.

‘What they will lead to is a Fred Goodwin-style situation where you will not be able to get money back off bankers when things go wrong. This is precisely what we have been trying to get away from in Britain.’

Mr Carney’s comments come after David Cameron told the Commons that there will be a £2,000 cap on bonuses paid in cash at RBS this year, following its introduction in 2013.

He also said the Government would use its position as the bank’s main shareholder to block any increase in the overall amount paid out in salaries and bonuses.

But he refused to rule out bonuses worth up to double an executive’s pay, as long as they are paid in stock and shares designed to deter the short-term risk-taking.

Taxpayers own 80 per cent of RBS, meaning the Chancellor can prevent this from happening. RBS has not yet lodged a request for the higher bonus cap.

It is discussing the matter with investors including UKFI, the arms-length body set up by the Government to manage taxpayers’ stakes in bailed out banks.

Any request will have to be put to the vote at RBS’s annual meeting with shareholders in Edinburgh  in May. Mr Cameron said: ‘I can confirm today that just as we have had limits on cash bonuses of £2,000 at RBS this year and last year, we will do the same next year as well.

‘If there are any proposals to increase the overall pay, that is pay and bonus bill at RBS, at the investment bank, any proposals for that, we will veto it.’

A Downing Street source said the 
total package of pay and bonuses at RBS had halved under the coalition 
Government, from £3billion in 2009 to £1.4billion in 2012 – although 
this is partly because its investment banking division is far smaller.

Quarrel: David Cameron refused Ed Miliband's call  to 
cap individual bank bonuses, but said he would use the Government’s 
powers to block any rise in the overall pay pot at RBS’s investment arm

The source added that given every household had been forced to contribute £5,000 to bail out the banking giant, the top priority had to be ensuring they got the money back by returning it to the private sector. But Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, criticised the announcements.

He said: ‘David Cameron has refused to rule out approving bonuses of up to 200 per cent at RBS. It looks like he and George Osborne would approve such a request at a time when ordinary families face a cost-of-living crisis and bank lending to businesses  is falling.’

Rob MacGregor, of the trade union Unite, said: ‘The Chancellor must not rubber stamp the corporate greed at Royal Bank of Scotland. If he looks the other way as the top bankers pat each other on the back and fill their boots hard working people across the country will be appalled.’

Chairman of the Treasury committee, Andrew Tyrie MP, said there should be no political interference in RBS.

‘RBS should be run on commercial grounds. Were decision-making at RBS to be subordinated to political considerations, it would be bad for the bank, bad for the taxpayers’ stake in the bank and bad for the wider economy,’ he said.

‘The structure and scale of remuneration in banking have incentivised misconduct and excessive risk-taking.

‘Risk and reward must be much more closely aligned, as the Banking Commission recommended.

‘The Governor of the Bank of England today agreed with the Banking Commission’s conclusion that a crude bonus cap is not the answer... the structure of remuneration is more important than the absolute level and that more deferral in variable pay is required.’
