Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Newcastle by claiming they look like they are playing friendlies against other teams compared to when they face Chelsea.

The Portuguese has never won at St James’ Park in both his spells in charge at Stamford Bridge and takes his unbeaten side there for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off.

Newcastle have won their last two home matches against Chelsea and Mourinho believes they raise their game when they take on his team.

‘When they play against other teams they look like they’re playing friendlies,’ Mourinho insisted. ‘Maybe this is because Chelsea, in the last decade, became a strong team that everybody wants to beat.

‘It’s a difficult stadium to play at. There are a few stadiums in this country where, clearly, when they see the Chelsea shirts, they play the game of their lives.

‘It’s a normal challenge for us, the same as another match. A difficult opponent and stadium, and one of the opponents we really feel that Chelsea is special for them, because they don’t play every game the same way.

‘It’s not only them. There are other clubs who have different ways of playing. Something that, with Chelsea, I try not to do. With my players I try to make them have always the same focus, ambition and commitment whoever they play.

‘But clearly there are some opponents in the Premier League for whom Chelsea are special, so we know this is going to be a tough match.’

Mourinho learnt all about Newcastle from Sir Bobby Robson when the pair were at Barcelona. But he has not let his barren run at St James’ Park turn him off playing against them.

‘Newcastle is a big club,’ he added. ‘I knew that since I worked with Mr Robson. People live for football, for the club, for the moment. They have a match at home, big passion, big club, unbelievable they don’t have a trophy for so many years. But they are a big club and I like very much to play there.’

Mourinho will set a club record of 24 matches unbeaten if his team win or draw on Saturday but he insisted he is not concerned with breaking records. ‘I’m looking for points,’ he explained. ‘And, if possible, at the end of the season, titles.

‘I’m not looking for records. The only thing that matters for me in the Premier League is that I won the title twice.’
