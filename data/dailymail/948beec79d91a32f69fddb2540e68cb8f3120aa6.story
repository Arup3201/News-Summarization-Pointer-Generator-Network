A teenage girl was indecently assaulted when two police impersonators stopped and searched her while she was walking to school in Sydney.

The schoolgirl saw the man and the woman, both dressed in blue clothes, emerge from a station wagon on a road in Quakers Hill on Monday at about 10.40am. Their vehicle had the word 'police' written on the side.

The Wyndham College student was then searched separately by the pair, believed to be in their 30s, where she alleges that the woman indecently assaulted her during the process.

Police said when the man asked to search the Wyndham College student, he retrieved a German shepherd from the back of the vehicle to assist him.

However the two didn't steal any of the girl's property. Police said the girl went home and told her father, who then informed police.

Officers believe the incident could have been a one-off 'prank'.

'Every now and then do you hear of people doing these things. It's not often they got to this extent dressed in blues and with a dog,' Quaker's Hill police duty officer, Inspector Steve Gallagher told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'There's still some chance it may have been a bit of a prank. That's one possibility that lessens the risk to the public if that's all that it was.'

The man is described as 180cm tall with short dark hair and olive skin while the woman is 160cm tall with brown hair in a pony tail.

Both were wearing light blue shirts, dark blue cargo pants and black footwear.

The teenager was walking along Douglas Road at about 10.40am when she saw a man and woman, both dressed in blue, emerge from a white station wagon with 'police' written on the side

In a separate incident, two men robbed a Mount Annan house - Sydney's south west - after pretending to be detectives and showing residents a fake police badge.

Police said a 66-year-old woman was washing up in her kitchen when she heard someone bang on the front door, ring the bell and call out 'police' about 11.30pm on May 19.

She opened the door to two men who flashed a fake police badge and claimed to be police officers who said they needed to execute a search warrant.

Two men, aged 40 and 68, who were also inside the house at the time were woken as the house was searched by the intruders.

Police will allege that they stole cash and jewellery, who then said they would send a receipt for the items. The pair then searched two vehicles in the garage before walking from the home on Welling Drive and turning left into Persoonia Close.

The two men are described as being of Caucasian appearance and having a slim build. The first man was 180cm tall while the second man was 165cm tall. Both wore blue pants and blue shirts that may have had a logo.

Investigators are examining links between the incident and a similar offence that occurred in the early hours of the following morning.

However Inspector Gallagher said there are no links between these police impersonations and the indecent assault of the school girl on Monday.

Anyone with information about the man or woman or the white station wagon they were driving should contact police.

The maximum penalty for a person who impersonates a police officer and pretends to exercise a power or function as an officer is seven years imprisonment.
