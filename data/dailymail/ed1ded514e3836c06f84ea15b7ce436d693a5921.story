He may be a student again but Prince William was not going to let his sartorial standards slide as he donned a tailored suit and tie for his first day at Cambridge University.

While many students might be content to attend classes in more casual attire, the Prince cut a dashing figure in his navy suit for his 'bespoke' course in agricultural management.

Despite picking out his smart apparel, the Duke of Cambridge, 31, showed he has the common touch by travelling to university for his first day by train, arriving back at King's Cross in London yesterday evening.

Earlier in the day the smiling royal looked unruffled as he arrived to start his 10-week course,  despite criticism from fellow students that he received a 'free pass' place.

The Duke was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will prepare him for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall, one of the biggest private estates in the country, from his father.

The course is run by Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership, an institution within the university’s School of Technology and has Prince Charles as its patron.

The father-of-one commuted by train from King's Cross this morning as began his studies and was met by senior academics and university management.

William has faced some anger over the decision to allow him to be admitted with an A, B and C in his A-levels – grades described as mediocre by the university newspaper.

Fresh start: After a successful spell as a rescue pilot, it appears William is looking to take over his father's Duchy of Cornwall estate

Tour: William was shown the world famous St John's but his learning will take place elsewhere during the 10-week course

Last time around: William on his first day at St Andrews in 2001, where he was dropped off by his father, who is patron of Cambriidge's School of Technology, which his son joined today

Some students claimed William was getting a free pass and said it gave the impression that he was accepted because he was ‘posh and rich’.

Cambridge normally requires an A* and two As from would-be undergraduates.

But the university pointed out that different admission rules apply for William’s agricultural course, and that he already has a degree, from St Andrews.

The Duke is expected to make the 46-minute journey for the course several days a week but will also have access to overnight accommodation in Cambridge.

It is understood he travelled to the city in a public carriage, although it was not clear which class of ticket he bought for the journey.

William looked relaxed as he toured the college's grounds on a grey and rainy day.

The Duke was greeted at St John's College, where some of his tutorials will take place, by vice chancellor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, along with Master of St John's, Professor Christopher Dobson, and Polly Courtice, director of the Programme for Sustainability Leadership.

Student life: These are the lecture rooms for the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership in the city of Cambridge where Prince William is going to be studying agriculture for the next ten weeks

Study time: William will spend his weekdays in these rooms, with executives from firms including BP and Lloyds

William stopped to view a plaque commemorating the Queen's visit to the college in April 2011.

The course, which will end in March, has been designed to help him prepare for when he inherits the Duchy of Cornwall estate.

The course has been designed specifically for him but will see him study alongside ordinary PhD students in some classes.

Professor Ross Anderson, of the 
university's Computer Laboratory, told the Cambridge News he and his 
colleagues should be free to design courses for those prepared to pay 
for it and they should not 'be discriminated against on account of the 
circumstances of their birth'.

He added: 'Whether they have any A-levels at all is no more relevant than the price of tea in China.'

During his studies, William will have a 
university card allowing him access to shared facilities such as 
libraries, bars and refectories.

William travelled up to Cambridge in standard class from London.

Mr Hardy, chairman of the Young Barristers' Committee of the Bar Council of England & Wales, later added: 'It was certainly a surprise, but he was just like any other passenger.

'It was all very low-key, to be honest. He just seemed to be getting on with his day'.

Cambridge University students seemed less excited about the royal arrival.

Tim Squirrell, 21, debate editor at the Tab student newspaper, said the reaction from fellow students had been 'mixed at best'.

He said: 'Overall I would say students are either mildly aggravated or mildly titillated by the Prince's arrival.

'But ultimately people are starting to see it as a good thing.

'The initial reaction was pretty polarised - some students were excited while others said it was a poor showing for meritocracy in Cambridge.

'But since people have understood that he's not doing an academically selected course, the feeling is much more positive.'

Academic record: The Duke started at St Andrews studying Art History before switching to Geography for his BA, during a period where he met his future wife

The Royal will have 20 hours of teaching time
 each week, including work in small groups as well as one-to-one tuition
 and his own additional reading.

He will also go on a series of field trips.

He will be taught by academics specialising in geography, land economy and plant sciences.

Modules he is expected to study include rural and planning policy, farming and supply chains, site management, agricultural policy and conservation governance.

Following the end of his service as an RAF rescue helicopter pilot in Anglesey, William is considering a number of options for public service, Kensington Palace said.

Details will be announced when he completes the course.
