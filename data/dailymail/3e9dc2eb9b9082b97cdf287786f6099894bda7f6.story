His death could so easily have been marked with a simple service in an almost empty chapel.

Harold Jellicoe Percival, a last link to the Dambusters raid, never married and had no children. When he died last month aged 99 he had no close friends and it seemed there would be no one to mourn him except a handful of care home staff.

But yesterday, after a newspaper appeal led to an internet campaign highlighting the forgotten war veteran’s case, hundreds of people who never knew him came to pay their respects at his funeral – poignantly held at 11am on Armistice Day.

Remembrance: Hundreds of people turned out for the funeral of Harold Jellicoe Percival in Lancashire

Coffin: The former airman's casket was wrapped in a British flag and the Dambusters theme was played as it was carried in

March: Many of those who turned out to Mr Percival's funeral were apparently in the military themselves

Well-wishers: Two out of the hundreds of mourners who attended Mr Percival's funeral despite never having met him

Emotion: One mourner wept at the moving event, which came after it emerged that Mr Percival had no close family to attend the service

Veteran: Harold Jellicoe Percival, who died last month aged 99, served with Bomber Command during the Second World War

The extraordinary turnout of strangers
 included many children, alongside current and former military personnel
 in uniform, some on leave from Afghanistan. All were determined to 
honour the service Mr Percival gave his country with Bomber Command as 
ground crew on the famous May 1943 raids by 617 Squadron.

Beneath
 a grey sky they queued at the crematorium in Lytham St Annes, 
Lancashire. Around 100 filled the pews within, another 400 or so for 
whom there were not enough seats stood outside in the rain.

After
 the funeral cortege arrived a two-minute silence was observed, then Mr 
Percival’s coffin, draped in the Union and RAF flags, was carried in to 
the chapel to the strains of The Dambusters March amid spontaneous 
applause.

The Reverend Alan 
Clark told mourners: ‘You have come in numbers surpassing anything that 
was expected. You come not because you knew him, but because each of us 
are part of each other. We have a common humanity.’

He
 also told them: ‘We marvel at the power of the printed word’, referring
 to the short notice appealing for mourners which the undertakers had 
placed in the local paper.

The
 funeral organisers were contacted by veterans’ groups and other 
military supporters keen to acknowledge Mr Percival and the appeal was 
quickly picked up by others on social networking sites.

Overcrowding: So many mourners attended the funeral that they could not fit inside the crematorium

Silence: A trumpeter played the Last Post to remember the dead at 11am

Youngsters: Two of the younger mourners who turned out to pay their last respects to Mr Percival

Sermon: The vicar told those gathered that the funeral was testament to the power of the written word

Gratitude: Janet Wareing, a matron at Mr Percival's care home, spoke at his funeral

After
 the service, which ended with the Last Post, Mr Percival’s nephew 
Andrew Collyer-Worsell said of the turnout: ‘It’s staggering. It shows 
how great the British public are. He was not a hero, he was just someone
 who did his duty in World War Two. We were expecting a few people, a 
few local veterans, but it snowballed. It’s very emotional.’

Undertaker
 Eddie Jacobs said: ‘This was a man with only a couple of very distant 
relatives going to his last resting place alone. The British people 
responded like only the British can.’

Among
 the mourners were staff from Alistre Lodge care home in Lytham St 
Annes, where Mr Percival spent the last two years of his life before 
dying on October 25.

Matron 
Janet Wareing said: ‘He would talk about the war sometimes. His sort of 
role has often been forgotten. He would remove the corpses of the 
aircrew from bombers when they returned full of bullet holes. Then he 
would try to keep the plane in the air ready for the next mission. It 
was very harrowing.’

Standing still: The funeral began at 11am on Armistice Day, when Britain stops to remember those who died in war

Pride: Hundreds wanted to express support for the war hero who died last month

His final journey: Mr Percival's coffin is unloaded from its hearse at the crematorium

Honour: A line of cadets queuing up in the rain during the former RAF serviceman's funeral ceremony

Harold
 Jellicoe Percival's funeral was disrupted today when the extremist 
British National Party tried to use the event to promote itself.

Amongst
 the floral tributes was a bunch of flowers with a card reading: 'Stand 
Down Soldier... Nick Griffin MEP and the British National Party'.

An undertaker removed the flowers from display after BNP members began to draw attention to them by photographing them.

But
 a party official asked angrily: 'Who has taken the flowers? They are 
from an MEP. If it was an MP from another party they would be left 
alone.'

However, when 
they demanded the return of the flowers, they were told: 'This is not a 
funeral for politicians or politics. There is no place for that here 
today.'

Group 
Captain Bob Kemp of the RAF Benevolent Fund said: ‘Harold Percival 
served in perhaps the most famous unit of World War Two. It is fitting 
that he should be given this sort of send-off. It is remarkable.’

Mr
 Percival, a distant relative of Spencer Perceval – who in 1812 became 
the only British prime minister to be assassinated – was born in Penge, 
South-East London.

The only love of his life, Jessie Campbell, is understood to have died of tuberculosis in 1935.

After
 the war Mr Percival emigrated to Australia, working as a decorator. He 
returned to Britain and lived in hotels until he moved into the care 
home where he died.

Elsewhere in Britain, silence fell at 11am as multiple acts of remembrance were held across the country.

The
 last surviving First World War widow, Dorothy Ellis, was among the 
guests at the national Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire.

The memorial bears the names of more than 16,000 fallen service personnel.

The event took place within the walls
 of the Armed Forces Memorial, which is designed to allow a shaft of 
sunlight to dissect its walls hitting the bronze wreath sculpture when 
the two-minute silence takes place.

Services
 held in the capital included one at the Lloyd's of London market in the
 City attended by the Chelsea Pensioners, and another in Trafalgar 
Square, featuring musical performances and readings.

In
 Northern Ireland, the mayor of Belfast made history by being the first 
Sinn Fein official to attend an Armistice Day commemoration.

Mairtin
 O Muilleoir ended the long-running republican boycott of the 
remembrance event, which was prompted by its links to the British 
military.

The Archbishop of Canterbury visited 
the Ministry of Defence and the Cenotaph in Whitehall to mark the solemn
 occasion, where he also met service chaplains and was updated on 
military operations.

Justin
 Welby said: 'At this time of year it's essential that we remember and 
give thanks for all those who gave their lives for the sake of freedom 
in the two World Wars, and also remember those who still risk their 
lives as servicemen and women in our Armed Forces.

'It's a time to recommit ourselves to the cause of peace and to seek to play our own small part as agents of reconciliation.'

In Belgium, the Duke of Edinburgh attended a 'sacred soil' ceremony alongside soldiers of the Household Division, Belgian soldiers, and schoolchildren from both the United Kingdom and Belgium.

The soil, gathered from some 70 First World War battlefields and Commonwealth War Grave Cemeteries, will be brought back to the UK to form the centrepiece of a Flanders Field memorial garden at Wellington Barracks.

It will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.
