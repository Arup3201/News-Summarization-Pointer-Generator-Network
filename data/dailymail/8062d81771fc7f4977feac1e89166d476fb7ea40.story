With Valentine's Day fast approaching, loved up couples are in pursuit of the best presents that money can buy to treat their partners.

And if you're lucky enough to live in Reigate in Surrey - where couples spend nearly £200 on their loved ones for Valentine’s Day - 14 February looks set to be one romantic day.

The sleepy Surrey commuter town, which is home to David Walliams and Dame Jude Dench, has turned out to be the hotbed of romance where Romeos and their Juliets spend £197.95 on average on Valentine's Day.

Wollaston in Northamptonshire came a close second, with residents there spending on average £180.50 at Valentines, and Oxted, also in Surrey scooped third place with an average spend of £126.

Escentual.com spokesman Rakesh Aggarwal, who carried out the research, said: 'The survey showed a huge difference in attitudes to romance across the country.

'Some areas like Reigate were extremely generous at Valentines – some other areas much less so.

'Most couples tend to start shopping for their presents on 31 January and next weekend and the week after will be peak sales weeks for perfume.'
