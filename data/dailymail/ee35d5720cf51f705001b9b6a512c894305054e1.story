Francois Hollande's approval rating has fallen below 20 per cent for the first time since he was elected in 2012, a new poll has revealed.

The French President's rating has dropped three points to just 19 per cent - a new low in his popularity, according to the TNS Sofres opinion poll for Le Figaro Magazine.

Meanwhile, a staggering 78 per cent of French voters have said they do not trust him.

Love life: It comes a month after the Socialist, 59, was revealed to be having an affair with actress Julie Gayet (right) - a revelation that caused his former partner and first lady, Valerie Trierweiler (left), to end up in hospital

The figures reflect Hollande's global reputation as a 'joke' - with many voters feeling he is more interested in his high-profile love life than solving his country's economic problems.

Last month, the 59-year-old Socialist was revealed to be having an affair with actress Julie Gayet - who is almost 20 years his junior - after pictures emerged of the couple leaving a Paris love nest by moped.

The revelation made headlines around the world - while Hollande's former partner and first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, ended up in hospital for eight days. 

Meanwhile, France's unemployment rate has soared to 11.1 per cent - the highest this century, along with a 14 per cent poverty rate.

Businesses are shutting down every day, 
while the cost of living is also soaring upwards - with many blaming 
Hollande's punitive tax regime, which includes a top rate of 75 per 
cent.

During a visit to Britain last week, Hollande was asked by a journalist if he was aware of his reputation as a 'joke' - but he refused to answer. 

The President is 21 months into his period of office - a time when French heads of state are traditionally riding relatively high in the polls.

His immediate predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, boasted a 37 per cent approval rating at this time, while Jacques Chirac had a 35 per cent rating.

Hollande's embarrassing rating comes as he prepares for his first state visit to the USA next week.

The unmarried politician is set to travel to America as a 'bachelor president' - despite his affair with Ms Gayet continuing. 

He has now formally split up with Ms Trierweiler, meaning she is no longer the first lady of France. 

Aides considered that Ms Gayet's presence at the White House would just further the president's unpopularity. 

The TNS poll was carried out between January 31 and February 3 and was based on interviews with 1,000 people aged 18 and over.
