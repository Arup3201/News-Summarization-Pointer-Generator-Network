Liverpool midfielder Lazar Markovic has hit back at Jose Mourinho after the Chelsea manager had the option to sign the Serbia international but decided against it.

Markovic joined Liverpool from Benfica for £20million during the summer's transfer window but could have easily ended up at Stamford Bridge for half price had Mourinho fancied buying the 20-year-old.

The two go up against each other on Tuesday night in the Capital One Cup semi-final as Liverpool welcome Chelsea to Anfield, but Markovic insists he doesn't need any extra motivation.

'I will not play to prove a point,' Markovic told the Daily Mirror. 

'No, I will play like every other match and I don't have to prove or show anything to him.

'He said I'm not good enough? That's Mourinho's opinion.'

Life in Liverpool  got off to a mixed start for the attacking midfielder, but Markovic hopes putting in the extra yards is being recognised by the club's supporters following their Champions League exit.

'Where did I get the strength to come through it? It came from myself and the support of my family,' he added. 'I wasn't losing trust in my myself and I was working harder myself at Melwood in training.

'I chose to do it it myself because when you are not achieving what you want, you push yourself more to build yourself and improve. It took time to settle, but maybe my form is better now.

'It has come good, and I scored at Sunderland. Of course it was great for me – but I am used to trying my best and doing my best, and I am hoping the supporters will recognise that.'
