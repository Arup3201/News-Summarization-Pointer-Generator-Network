It started out as a way for freelance designer Charlie Layton to entertain himself over his morning coffee.

The Philadelphia-based artist realised his fridge freezer door was made out of the same material as a dry-erase board and was perfect for him to practice doodling.

Now every Friday he spends 25 minutes trying to come up with something clever and then posts his efforts online.

Screen wipe: The weekly hobby began when Charlie realised the surface of his fridge freezer was the same as a dry-erase board

But his artwork quickly went viral after his friend posted a link his 'Freezer Friday' blog on Reddit where it was briefly the most-read story.

The publicity drove so much traffic to Charlie's website that at one point it crashed.

'It's pretty crazy. It's hard to grasp that thousands of people have seen something so quickly,' he said of his new-found fame.

Some popular characters occasionally pop up in his sketches including Darth Vader and the Abominable Snowman.

Each drawing takes 25-30 minutes for him to produce, and Charlie says he tries to come up with something clever in each one.
