It wasn't just the Clasico — Victor Valdes always prepared for every game by imagining the worst things that could happen.

He would muscle up his psychological preparedness by spending time mentally filing through the great times in his career, the things he valued highly in his personal life.

If he had a stinker, or even if he had a blinder but still couldn't stop his opponents getting the better of Barcelona, then he would have a store of precious images and memories with which to dilute the pain of defeat or failure. He would rely on them.

This will be Barca's first Clasico at the Nou Camp without Valdes at the club since 2002 - 13 years.

Despite the million-kilowatt glare given off by the stars on the playing surface, I'll miss his presence — saturnine, deeply competitive, gently eccentric, hugely effective. Damn good at his job and one of the plethora of characters who have helped elevate this to the best, most regularly high-quality, most-watched game of football in the world.

I am still learning what Claudio Bravo's mind usually does to him before a big game, and, vice versa, what the former Real Sociedad keeper tries to do to either dominate or harness the powerful psychological alert system which should be telling him, right about now: 'Oh no! Real Madrid again.'

From the moment when David Beckham scored past him with a free-kick at the Anoeta Stadium in February 2007, where the ball squirted past Bravo like a wet, angry salmon trying to evade capture, the contest with Los Blancos has appeared to have been Bravo's Room 101.

Following that Beckham moment, Bravo has faced Madrid 10 times, losing nine, drawing one and conceding 33 goals. Like Colin Montgomerie and a major golf tournament, Brazilian Ronaldo and the Champions League, Madrid are the sharpest thorn, digging into the goalkeeper's side.

Back in October, leading 1-0, perhaps he allowed himself to dream. But by the end it was 3-1 going on 6-1. It's important to be clear, in not one of Real's goals — Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty, Pepe's thunderous header, Karim Benzema's blitzkrieg counter-attack third — did the Chilean carry any blame.

But here he is, guardian of a team expected to win — able to make a decisive statement about taking the title back, at a time when they are in the last eight of the Champions League and Copa del Rey finalists.

His mind must have wandered to ... what if? He's already admitted: 'It's true, we do talk about the Treble... it's an achievement which was in this club's recent past and it would be fantastic to repeat.

'But thinking about it and assuming it's going to happen are totally different things.'

Right now Bravo is in line to win the important Ricardo Zamora Trophy for La Liga's stingiest keeper — 16 goals conceded in 27 matches. But, even given that statistic, he's yet to give, or be asked for, a display where he can definitively say: 'Those three points belong to me.'

Chile's star of the World Cup admits it is still a learning process. 'People ask you the difference of playing at Barcelona compared to another team and it' s waiting. Waiting with total concentration, mental preparation, staying ready despite the fact that you might not be tested, not even involved for 20 or 30 minutes at a time.

'I tell myself that we are under attack, that at any second, including that one right then, something vital might be asked of me.'

The match will be Barcelona's first Clasico at the Nou Camp without Victor Valdes in 13 years

Just under 105 metres away from him for most of the night will be someone who would have nodded, with a knowing grin, at all of those sentiments.

This isn't the first time that some have reckoned that Iker Casillas is facing his final Clásico (and who knows whether the two sides might yet meet in the Champions League) — but neither Father Time nor the club's transfer market planners are on his side.

If Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez has his way, this will be David de Gea's fixture next season. But, right now, it's San Iker's.

The 4-3 loss to Schalke at the Bernabéu 12 days ago was the match which made all Barca fans say: 'Three points on March 22, for sure. Madrid have gone.'

But that's not so. Casillas was correctly blamed for at least two of those goals. But the impression that the game, and it's embarrassing defending, was definitive was false, I think.

Casillas' desire, his cat-like alacrity seem diminished. But he's a feisty, cold-minded competitor and this matters the world to him. Thirty-seven times he' s played Barca, far more than any other rival.

If this is his last, and he'd like there to be another six or seven before leaving in 2017, then he'll be determined to produce another save like the one which turned last October's clash. Losing 1-0 to Neymar's opener, Casillas made a point-blank save from Messi (who's scored 18 times past the Madrileño).

Madrid weren't 2-0 down at home, Madrid pressed the accelerator and crushed Luis Enrique's side in 'Lucho's' first Clásico as a coach.

It's an anecdote that Casillas' first Clasico at the Nou Camp, nearly 15 years ago, also saw the first goal he conceded to Barca — scored by that same Lucho.

When the world watches this contest it will be in anticipation of another of the three-plus goal games we've seen over the last 10 years.

But spare a thought for the Nou Camp Clasico debutant in one goal, and the legend in the other. Different lives, different men. Shared pressure.
