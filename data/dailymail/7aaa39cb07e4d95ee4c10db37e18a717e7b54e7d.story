I wonder if Rio Ferdinand was true to his word at 10.30 on Saturday night? In the trailer announcing the arrival of the fiftieth anniversary season of Match Of The Day, QPR’s new centre half says that as soon as he hears the show’s iconic theme tune, he drops everything and heads for the telly.

Or perhaps this weekend, after his debut for his new team that siren song actually sounded more like the theme from Jaws? And saw Peckham’s finest getting out of earshot, and sharpish!

Because prior to the inaugural weekend of the new Premier League season, we had been promised by the BBC that their old dog would show us a few new tricks. And that the pundits would be encouraged to let fly with their opinions.

Copped it: Rio Ferdinand (pictured) was heavily criticised by Alan Shearer on Match of the Day

At fault: Shearer blamed Ferdinand (second right) for failing to mark James Chester (far right) for his goal

So was Saturday night the dawn of a new Shearer? Well, for instance, they certainly took no prisoners when the boys discussed their old pal from the World Cup studio in Brazil.

Having lost his man for Hull’s winner at Loftus Road, as well as ending up kneeing a chance to cancel it out, Ferdinand’s fellow pundit in Rio, Alan Shearer, took almost too much pleasure in pointing out where he’d gone wrong. He reminded us that Rio had said out there that he was not a fan of zonal marking, then gleefully added he clearly wasn’t ‘a fan of marking either’. While of his miss, the old No 9 shook his head forlornly and said ‘all the practise we put in on Copacabana beach’.

All this though, as you’d expect, with a twinkle in the eye. But those samba days of summer clearly worked as a benchmark for the new approach to this Match Of The Day season. To underline that point, it was Ruud Gullit who was tasked with filling the chair vacated by Alan Hansen. There will be many who feel that simply removing Hansen’s overbearing personality would be enough to give Match of The Day its ‘new look’. But you can’t just have an empty chair.

TV pals: Shearer (far left) and Ferdinand (second left) were part of the BBC's World Cup punditry team

Conflicting ideas: Ruud Gullit (left) and Shearer (right) didn't always see eye-to-eye on decisions

Gullit clearly didn’t find it a big seat to fill. He became part of the team in South America, and it showed on Saturday night. First of all, he dovetailed nicely with his Geordie counterpart. And finally, FINALLY, was doing so at least in part because now both pundits shared their opinions on all the games. That abstract system of letting one man talk as the other sat mute is now hopefully a thing of the past.

But it wasn’t all a box of chocolates between them. When discussing the Kyle Naughton penalty and subsequent red card at Upton Park, it got a bit tasty. Gullit stood his ground by stating ‘it’s the rules’, but Shearer chipped away stating the ref ‘should show common sense’. They smiled benignly at each other on set, but I bet they carried on that little tete a tete after the lights had dimmed. It was certainly what the DJ’s amongst us might call the right vibe.

Seeing red: Gullit and Shearer disagreed over the dismissal of Tottenham's Kyle Naughton (second right)

Correct decision? Naughton (centre) was sent off for deliberate handball at West Ham on Saturday

And what of the guv’nor? I’ve often pointed out that Gary Lineker is one of the best sports anchors we’ve got. And the fact he was a top notch pro in his previous career is most certainly the icing on the cake.

On Saturday night, though, he reminded us he is none too shabby in the role of journalist, either. Although, granted, Crystal Palace’s co-chairman Steve Parish is a bit of a gaping net as he seems an affable, open man.

Nevertheless - in the innovation introduced last season of Gary capturing an interview post match with a figure in the headlines - the host pushed the envelope just a little further than I seem to remember him doing before.

One of the best: Gary Lineker is regarded as one of Britain's best sporting presenters

Nice touch: Lineker demonstrated his journalistic skills in his interview with Steve Parish (centre)

Questions about Tony Pulis such as ‘perhaps he thought there was a better job out there?’, ‘do you feel let down?’ and then saying ‘worth an ask’ before enquiring who would be his replacement, may seem obvious. But in the more comfortable, perhaps sterile atmosphere of Match Of The Day in, say, its thirties and forties, I don’t think they would have been asked. And luckily for us all, so honestly and interestingly answered. Which in part may just be because people don’t want to let Gary down? They want to tell  him the truth.

A good trick in our game if you can pull that off!

And so we’re off and running again and Match Of the Day is looking more than match fit at the grand old age of fifty. And perhaps this is just the right season for it to suck in its gut, trim the nose hairs and not buy its shirts from the supermarket. Al reckoned on Saturday night that ‘it’s thirteen teams that could go down’. While Ruud described the Premier League as now being ‘not weaker (but) interesting.'

Well here’s to Match Of The Day echoing those words throughout its half century.
