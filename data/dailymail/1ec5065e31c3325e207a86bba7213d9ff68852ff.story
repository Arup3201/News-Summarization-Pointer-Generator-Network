A beloved 80lb white Labrador has been killed by an alligator after it attacked him while he was swimming in a creek in Florida.

The nine-year-old dog, named Benny, was cooling off  at Shingle Creek, near Hunter's Creek, Orange County, last Thursday when the reptile pounced.

First-grader Anna Flores watched in horror as the alligator attacked her adored pet, before submerging him under the water and eating him.

She told them: 'You should be careful not to bring them to creeks or anything because then they can start swimming and get attacked by an alligator like mine did.'

Anna's father, Marcos, said Benny was a beloved pet who would accompany his daughter to the bus stop every day and meet her when she got off the school bus in the evening.

The Flores family's neighbors also paid tribute to Benny, whom they say was a 'very special' dog.

Justin Camilleri told News 13 he was 'always happy all the time to see people, never barked at anyone, or bite anyone ever, always really friendly, loved to play fetch.'

A licensed trapper with the Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program has now been assigned to capture the alligator, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said.

The agency has also warned locals across central Florida to be cautious because of recent rain and flooding, with high water levels potentially bringing alligators and other predators closer to homes.

It comes just weeks after a puppy pit-bull was killed after an alligator grabbed it from the shores of a lake at Eagles Nest Park in Orlando and drowned it. 

Owner Eric Glover, who watched the shocking incident unfold, said the attack happened while he was playing fetch with this 10-month-old puppy, King.
