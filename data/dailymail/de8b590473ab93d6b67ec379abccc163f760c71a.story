Allan Dale described in court how he saw his wife cowering under their duvet as she tried to shield herself from their grandson's frenzied knife attack

A grandfather has described how his grandson looked like Norman Bates in Psycho when he came at him and his wife with a knife in their bedroom.

Allan Dale, 80, whose wife Irene, 78, was killed in the frenzied attack, said that his wife cowered under their duvet during the brief attack at their house in Hull.

Their grandson, Lewis Dale, 17, is on trial for murder and attempted murder.

Speaking from behind a screen at Hull Crown Court he said: 'It was like that Psycho film - Norman Bates.

'He just came round. It was just like that Norman Bates with the knife. It was all over in seconds.'

The pensioner then demonstrated to the judge and jury how his grandson stabbed him in the chest and then again in the abdomen.

He said: 'It was a kitchen knife, shaped like a wedge - the strongest knife in the block.'

Mr Dale said his wife woke up and was scared.

He said she said to her grandson: 'What are you doing, Lewis?'

Mr Dale said: 'I got up. How I managed to get up I don't know. I must have gone for him. That's when he stabbed me in the side.'

He explained to the jury how his grandson left without saying a word and threw the knife at him. He said the weapon missed, sticking in the bedroom floor.

Mr Dale described how his wife pulled the duvet over her head as the defendant attacked her and was left with her head resting on a bedside table.

He said it was only a few minutes before his grandson left the house and got into the taxi. Mr Dale said: 'He sort of waved at me as if he was going on holiday.

He told the jury he had been married to Irene for 57 years and that they had raised their children in the house after moving there in 1972.

 Hull Crown Court was told there was no 
dispute that Lewis Dale (left), 17, killed Irene Dale (right), 78, and seriously 
injured her husband Allan, 80, with a kitchen knife as they lay asleep

Andrew Robertson QC, defending, asked him about his relationship with Dale, which he said was 'very good'.

He agreed that he and his wife 'both thought the world of him' and that Dale adored them too,

He said his wife played a big part in bringing up his grandson adding: 'I can remember him now in his play pen.'

Mr Dale said his grandson was a regular and keen visitor but came to live with them about 10 days before the tragedy.

He agreed this was due to some 'trouble with the police' at his father's home.

Dale
sat in the dock wiping away tears as his grandfather described his 
family life and the close relationship he and his wife had with him.

Mr Dale agreed there was no explanation for what happened in the early hours of April 27.

He
said that only hours before the attack he had spoken his grandson as he
was lying on his bed in his boxer shorts and telling him: 'I'm tired 
grandad'.

Mr Dale agreed 
that in his police statement he had used the work 'psychotic' when 
described the stabbing incident, adding that it was 'as if he was mad'.

'I know it was Lewis but I can't understand it, why it happened,' the pensioner said.

Adrian Strong, prosecuting, described how Dale attacked his grandparents as they were in bed at their home in Hull, in April

Earlier
today, prosecutor Adrian Strong described how Dale attacked his 
grandparents as they were in bed at their home in Hull, in April.

Mr Strong said Dale was a user of the drug mephedrone which he said was also known as 'meow meow or M-Cat'.

He
said: 'I anticipate that Lewis Dale will tell you that at the time of 
the attack on his grandparents he was suffering a psychotic episode as a
result of his drug use.'

Mr Strong said mephedrone used to be called a 'legal high' but was outlawed in 2010 and is now a class B controlled drug.

He said users claim it provokes euphoria and heightened energy.

But he said there were also reports it caused restlessness, anxiety, confusion and psychosis.

Mr Strong said Mr and Mrs Dale had gone to bed at about 10.30pm on Friday April 26.

They had been married for 50 years and had lived in the house where Mrs Dale died for 40 years, the jury was told.

Dale, who denies murder and attempted murder, was living with his grandparents at the time of the attack.

Dale, who denies murder and attempted murder, was living with his grandparents at the time of the attack. The jury was told one of the knife wounds suffered by Irene went through her heart and into her lung

Mr
Strong said Dale went into his grandparents' bedroom shortly after 
Allan Dale had got up to use the bathroom at around 2am and had got back
into his bed next to his wife.

The defendant was wearing a bathrobe with the hood pulled up, the prosecutor said.

The
prosecutor said: 'Before he (Allan Dale) could say or do anything, 
Lewis lunged at him and plunged a large kitchen knife into his chest.

At least one person a week dies after taking mephedrone, which until two years ago was legal.

Yet
despite the dangers the drug, Known as 'plant food' or 'mew meow', has 
been hugely popular because of its cheapness and easy availability. It is now a class B drug.

In 2010 clubbing magazine Mixmag christened mephedrone 'the UK's favourite new drug'.

Used as a replacement for ecstasy or cocaine, it is sold on hundreds of internet sites for around £10 a gram.

And unlike cocaine, it is unlikely to be cut with baking soda, paracetamol or more dangerous substances.

Buying
it online with your credit card is straightforward and avoids any 
contact with drug dealers or the danger of a run-in with the law.

A
survey for the magazine found four out of ten of those surveyed had 
tried it and a third had taken it within the previous month. One in six 
said they took it every week.

It is most often snorted in powder form but can also be obtained in pills and capsules.

Side-effects
include headaches, palpitations, nausea, high blood pressure, a burning
throat, nose bleeds and purple joints, especially the knees and hands.

'It
is the choice of weapon and the force used against Allan Dale that, the
prosecution say, mean we can be sure this was attempted murder and that
Lewis Dale intended to kill Allan.'

He said the defendant repeatedly stabbed his grandfather in the upper body.

Mr Strong said Irene Dale then woke up and shouted at her grandson: 'Lewis, what are you doing?'

'Lewis
Dale broke off the attack on his grandfather, went round the other side
of the bed and repeatedly stabbed Irene as she lay in the bed, under 
the duvet,' he said.

'Having stabbed Irene repeatedly through the duvet, he threw the knife at his grandfather and ran downstairs.'

The jury was told one of the knife wounds suffered by Irene went through her heart and into her lung.She died at the scene.

Mr Strong described how Allan Dale barricaded the room after the defendant left. He said the pensioner struggled to call 999 because the phone line had been cut but did manage to summon police and paramedics.

Allan Dale said he heard his grandson shouting 'give me some money and I'll go' from downstairs.

The jury was told that Dale left in a taxi ordered by his drug dealer, taking a TV from the house with him.

He was arrested in Hull city centre later that night by armed police.

Mr Strong said that he was taken to a police station and was mainly concerned with the whereabouts of a suitcase he had been carrying. He also questioned officers about why he was arrested on suspicion of robbery as well as the murder and attempted murder.

But he told a doctor at the police station he was there 'because I've killed my gran', adding: 'I did it.'

The prosecutor said there was telephone evidence of contact between Dale and his drug dealer after the attack and he said the defendant took the TV from the house to exchange for M-Cat. He also took the drug between the attack and his arrest, about an hour and 40 minutes later.

A blood test found mephedrone and cocaine in his body, the jury heard.

Mr Strong said: 'This wasn't psychosis. It was drug related. It was all bound up with Lewis Dale's wish and desire to obtain more drugs for himself - selfishness.'

Dale appeared to be crying at one point during the description of the attack on his grandparents.

He sat in the dock wearing a dark suit and a black, open-necked shirt, flanked by a single security guard, and sporting short, red hair.

The case continues.
