A lawyer has been suspended after admitting to an affair with a client - and billing her for time they spent having sex, it was revealed last week.

Attorney Thomas Lowe had a six-month relationship with the woman he was representing in a divorce case.

The 58-year-old, who is married, began an affair with his client after complimenting on her appearance and talking about her sex life.

The pair embarked on an affair and met up on numerous occasions to have sex.

Documents obtained from Lowe's office in Burnsville, Minnesota revealed that on the dates he was having sex he billed the women for his time and coded their liaisons as 'meetings' or 'drafting memos'.

Lowe, from Eagan, Minnesota, eventually broke off the affair after several arguments with the woman in a bid to save his own marriage.

He also withdrew as her attorney leading to the woman, who had past abuse and mental health issues, to try and kill herself. While she recovered in hospital she told authorities about the affair.

Lowe initially denied having the affair, but later 'unconditionally admitted the allegations' to the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility.

The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled on January 10 that he be suspended indefinitely and lose his license to practice law.

Documents obtained by the Pioneer Press revealed that Lowe first met with the woman in August 2011 to discuss her possibility of representing her in a divorce.

After agreeing to represent her during a phone call days later, Lowe asked about her sexual relationship with her husband, commented on her appearance and asked if she was interested in sex with him.

Their affair began the following month and lasted until March 2012 when Lowe ended the relationship.

It is not the first time Lowe has been in trouble, according to the Pioneer Press. In 1997, he was placed on probation for buying cocaine from a client.

Lowe will be able to apply for his license to practice law after a minimum of 15 months.
