A woman who says she received explicit photos and messages from a married professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island has apologized for making their alleged correspondences public.

John Schindler, a former NSA intelligence and a very public critic of whistle-blower Edward Snowden, was placed on leave on Monday after his flirtatious emails and a racy photo of his penis were posted on Twitter.

The woman, who lists her name as Lesley 
on Twitter and uses the handle @Currahee88, tweeted on Tuesday that she 
was ‘truly sorry’ and that ‘if I could go back and change this I would 
do so immediately.’

A woman, known only as Lesley, who says she received explicit photos and messages from John Schindler, pictured, a married professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island has apologized for making their alleged correspondences public

Lesley allegedly gave screenshots of Schindler's intimate messages to @T3H_ARCH3R, a self-described internet troll, who then posted the photos online. 

Naval War College has said it is investigating Schindler and he has been placed on leave.

In her tweets, Lesley also stated that the photo was not unsolicited and that her aim had been to embarrass Schindler and inform his wife. She then deactivated her Twitter account.

@T3H_ARCH3R, whose real name is Trent Jensen and who has also deleted his Twitter account, told BuzzFeed that both he and Lesley had received threats since the publication of the photos.

‘I’ve been getting a lot more than her because I’m the one who posted the photos,’ he said.

Jensen, who is confident the posts are real, said he wasn’t sure if he regretted posting the photos.

‘[Schindler] is somebody that’s supposed to be instructing our people on how to do things the right way. The information that was presented to me was that she was the victim. It was “Hey I need help.” She reached out to me for help.’

Schindler, who is Professor of National Security Affairs at the college, allegedly captioned the photo of his penis 'Got this?'

'Oh dear... :)' Lesley, the recipient of the sexual snap, allegedly replied.

Schindler then allegedly wrote 'Now ya got it...'

'Kisses, J': Schindler allegedly wrote this letter in which he writes about looking forward to meeting Lesley, who he calls a 'vixen'

The image, along with a screenshot of an email allegedly written by Schindler, were uploaded as part of a series by @T3H_ARCH3R.

In
 the email allegedly written by Schindler, he said he was looking forward to meeting Lesley, who he called a 'vixen,' while also claiming that he is in a 
non-traditional marriage.

'I am married to a very kind and understanding woman, but it's not a marriage in a 'normal' or conventional sense; I won't say more than that now, though I will add that she's...not poor,' he allegedly wrote.

Later on, the letter reads 'Suffice it to say I find you immensely engaging and enticing - you occupy my thoughts more than I easily admit, you vixen - and I have no doubt that any meeting in the flesh would be hours of deep talk and more that I would probably not be able to contain my excitement over easily, if at all.'

A blogger sent a complaint to the War College's administration - and the college's president, Rear Adm. Walter E. 'Ted' Carter Jr., quickly ordered an investigation.

A college spokeswoman said investigators would look into whether the photo could have been falsified.

Saying goodbye: Schindler's first sign-off is seen here

Updated: Schindler's goodbye was changed to include much shorter text

Schindler refused to discuss the photo by telephone on Monday, citing legal reasons. He has deleted his Twitter account.

Schindler has been critical of leaker Edward Snowden and others and has frequently engaged in heated exchanges with critics on Twitter.

On his website, he wrote on Monday that he has been subjected to 'nearly non-stop online harassment and stalking' for the past year and 'things have now taken an ugly, indeed sordid turn.'

That post was later replaced with a much shorter statement, telling supporters he is taking a break from social media because of personal issues.

Schindler had taught at the college since 2005. He is also a fellow at Boston University, according to its website. He was a senior intelligence analyst with the NSA from 1996 to 2004.

The Newport, Rhode Island, college said in a statement it could not comment further to protect the integrity of the investigation. It did not say how long the investigation would take.
