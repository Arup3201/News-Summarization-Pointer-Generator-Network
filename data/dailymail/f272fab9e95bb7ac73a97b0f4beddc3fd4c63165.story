Italy and Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini has joined the criticism of the Italian football federation (FIGC) presidential candidate Carlo Tavecchio after the 71-year-old referred to African players as 'banana eaters.'

As the row continued to fester a week after the comments were made, Chiellini said that the position needed somebody with 'decorum and personality' and that Tavecchio's rival Demetrio Albertini, a former Italy midfielder, was the only suitable candidate.

The election to replace Giancarlo Abete, who quit following Italy's group stage exit at the World Cup, is due to take place on Aug. 11.

Controversy: The 71-year-old referred to African players as 'banana eaters' last week

'I read his (Tavecchio's) words the day after and they left me disconcerted,' Chiellini said.

'I asked...how Italian football could be heading towards this election and if there was any solution.

'I have nothing personal against Tavecchio but at the moment, the only adequate person for the role is Albertini.'

The 29-year-old continued: 'We mustn't let Italian football embarrass itself again. The national team is bigger than Tavecchio but we must avoid having a certain type of figure for these roles.

'We need a person with a certain decorum and personality to perform certain roles.'

FIGC vice-president Tavecchio has received a wave of criticism for his comments, which came at the summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues (LND), and FIFA has asked for an investigation.

Preferred: Chiellini says Tavecchio's rival Demetrio Albertini is the only credible candidate for the job 

He made the comment as he suggested that Italy should replicate England's stringent requirements for non-EU players.

'In England, they identify the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play,' he said.

'Here instead we get 'Opti PobÃ ', who previously ate bananas and then suddenly becomes a first team player with Lazio.'

Tavecchio, who initially had the support of all Serie A clubs except Juventus and AS Roma, has seen his backing drop since the incident, although many clubs, including AC Milan, still back him.
