From jokes and jibes aimed at rival teams, to passionate tributes to their own clubs, football fans have long used banners as a means of getting their message across.

Now a UK academic has hailed the humble football banner as an 'art form', pointing out that supporters are becoming increasingly clever and creative when it comes to devising their slogans.

Dr Jamie Cleland said that, while the intelligence of sports fans is often 'downplayed', the messages adorning football stands are just as likely to be witty political puns as crude jokes at other teams' expense.

Witty: Irish football fans give their take on the EU bailout of their debt-stricken country at a Euro 2012 fixture

The Loughborough University professor highlighted a group of Ireland fans who turned up at the Euro 2012 tournament bearing a flag emblazoned with the phrase: 'Angela Merkel thinks we're at work'.

The cheeky banner name-checking the German Chancellor was a reference to the EU bailout of the debt-stricken country, and made headlines during the football tournament.

'Fans respond to the news agenda of the day,' said the lecturer, who has conducted research into football fan-dom.

'Sports fans get down-played as not necessarily being very intelligent, but football fans can be very creative.'

Dr Cleland also recalled seeing a sign that read 'MUFC AAA rating' in the stands at Old Trafford in the days after the UK was stripped of its prized triple A credit rating.

The professor said the rise of social media meant a clever banner could give a football fan access to a form of short-term fame, as pictures of a popular banner could quickly go viral on Twitter or Facebook.
