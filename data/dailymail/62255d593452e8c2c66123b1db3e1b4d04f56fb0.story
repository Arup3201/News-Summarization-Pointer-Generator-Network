Twitter's users have rocketed by 24 per cent to 271 million, the firm announced today as it revealed better than expected financial results.

Although still dwarfed by rival Facebook's 1.3 billion users, the online messaging service's stock soared almost 30 percent after hours.

The San Francisco-based company's stock jumped 29.6 percent to $50.01 in extended trading after the results came out.

Twitter reported a 124 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $312 million, beating Wall Street's expectation for $283.1 million.

At its peak in December, Twitter enjoyed a $46 billion market capitalization on just $665 million of revenue in 2013, making it one of the world's priciest stocks.

Twitter said the World Cup showed the firm can still extend into new areas.

'Whether the crowd was reacting to a big goal, predicting the outcome of the next match, or discussing the latest injury or controversy, fans came to Twitter to discuss the games 672 million times,' it said after the final.

'While this is the highest number we’ve announced related to an event, it’s hard to compare the 32-day, 64-match World Cup to, for example, the single-game Super Bowl, the one-night Oscars, or the 16-day Olympics.'

Timeline views, a measure of the engagement of its users, also exceeded expectations with a 15 percent increase.

Twitter reported a 124 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $312 million, beating Wall Street's expectation for $283.1 million.

Its shares rose 26 percent to $48.80 in extended trading, from a close of $38.59 on the New York Stock Exchange.

'Our strong financial and operating results for the second quarter show the continued momentum of our business,' said Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter.

'We remain focused on driving increased user growth and engagement, and by developing new product experiences, like the one we built around the World Cup, we believe we can extend Twitter's appeal to an even broader audience.'

Wall Street had been divided on whether Twitter can transform itself into a mainstream Internet platform on the same scale as Facebook.

Some investors argue its reported user numbers do not fully reflect engagement, particularly with media viewers.

Others say its inherently complex format deters wider adoption.

User growth has stagnated since Twitter went public to much fanfare in November.

Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo has said that tweaks to Twitter's product would result in better user engagement, and has asked Wall Street for time to show improvement.

Twitter posted a net loss of $144.6 million, or 24 cents per share, in the April-June period.

That compares with a loss of $42.2 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier when Twitter was still a private company.

Adjusted earnings were 2 cents per share in the latest quarter, beating analysts' expectations of a loss of 1 cent, according to FactSet.

Revenue was $312.2 million, up from $139.3 million.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting revenue of $283.3 million.

Average monthly users were 271 million as of the end of June, up 24 percent from a year earlier and up 6 percent from the end of March.

Mobile advertising revenue was $224 million, or 81 percent of the quarter's total ad revenue.

In the first quarter, mobile ad revenue amounted to about 80 percent of total ad revenue.
