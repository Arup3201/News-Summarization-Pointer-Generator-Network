Those anticipating a halt to the Alexis Sanchez One-Man Show during these winter months were again confounded by his all-action performance against Stoke.

Two goals and one assist to add to his collection this season put Mark Hughes’s side to the sword and enhanced Sanchez’s position as the most potent forward in the Premier League.

His £32million fee from Barcelona grows in value by the day. No player has been involved in more Premier League goals than Sanchez: 19. He has struck the back of the net 12 times himself, and made seven assists.

Sanchez has been a huge hit at the Emirates since arriving from Barcelona for £32m during the summer

His cross for Laurent Koscielny to open the scoring at the Emirates on Sunday was inch-perfect, requiring the application of a most straight-forward of headers.

Sanchez has played up front, in the hole and out wide – drifting in to cause mayhem. His first goal against Stoke came that path; from the left wing he had the strength to ride Steven N’Zonzi’s challenge, the silk to dribble into the box and dispatch a precise shot inside Asmir Begovic’s near post.

The Chilean’s talent has never been in doubt. He starred for his country at two World Cups, and for Barcelona over three seasons. But the sheer bloody-mindedness he has approached English football has been remarkable.

Many believed he would suffer a dip without the luxury of winter break; his body, that 5ft 7in muscular frame which allows his breathless style, would require a few weeks to rest and recuperate.

That is not the indication so far. He has played 30 games in all competitions this season, many times man-of-the-match. At 26 he has plenty more years to make good on his early promise to become a club figurehead.

Although Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is acutely aware of the dangers of overloading the team’s talisman, Oxlade-Chamberlain believes Sanchez’s natural energy can carry him through.

‘Alexis absolutely loves it. He is like a Duracell battery - he just does not give in,” the England midfielder said.

‘Whether it is a cup competition or times when you think maybe it could be a chance for him to come out and rest, he is the first one to say he wants to play and he always wants to be a part of it.

‘I am sure if the boss wants to rest him, he would respect that as well, but his attitude and the way he approaches training, you wouldn’t think he was tired and the way he is playing, you wouldn’t take him out of the side either.

‘Hopefully, he can keep his fitness and keep going, but the athlete that I see every day, I can’t see him falling short anytime soon.’

Thierry Henry watched on from the stands on Sunday, and the signs are Sanchez could become Arsenal’s first talisman since the Frenchman departed. It is not lip service to say legendary status awaits.

Take Sanchez’s impact out of Arsene Wenger’s team and they would be 19th in the division. Clearly those statistics do not allow for another player to come in and potentially bridge the gap. But the extent of his importance is clear. 

Without those 19 contributions to goals, Arsenal would be 14 points worse off. Arsenal are out of the top four because their defence is susceptible to moments of comical collapse and their midfielder lacks a general to impose order.

But, were Wenger to address these issues in the summer market, Sanchez is the player to spur a title charge. He is a player to build a team around, a dynamo whose energy and potential appears limitless.
