A grandmother had to deliver her daughter's baby in the back of a taxi as her labour progressed before they could make it to the hospital in time.

Jenny Dakin, 27, was with her mother Sharon, 51, and her partner Tyrone Allonby, 42, when she began to have contractions every five minutes in the cab.

Jenny, a mother-of-two from Bolton, knew the baby wanted to come and had no choice but to push while on the back seat of the car.

Luckily, cleaning supervisor Sharon was on hand to save the day as she delivered the baby near Burnden Retail Park.

Grandmother-of-five Sharon explains how the drama unfolded: 'We phoned for a taxi at 11.24 and it arrived around 15 minutes later but the baby was born by 11.46.

'Jenny told me she needed to push and I said, "don't be silly". I looked over at her and the next thing I could see the baby's head so I know she was going to have to give birth there and then.

'I practically threw my phone at the taxi driver and shouted at him to ring 999 for help.'

Sharon said the driver was as shocked as they were about the baby's speedy arrival.

'He jokingly said not to make a mess in the car but I could see he was absolutely terrified. He could barely speak and his face went very pale,' she recalls.

'We asked him to pull over but he said, "I have to do my job and get you to hospital".'

Meanwhile, she said her daughter tried to remain calm. 'Jenny had her legs up on the passenger window but she just seemed determined to do what was best for the baby.'

Sharon admitted that her 'basic instincts' kicked in and she successfully helped deliver her granddaughter, Natasha-Ann, who weighed 6lb 4oz and is now doing well at the Royal Bolton Hospital.

Sharon said: 'I pulled the baby out and she was completely awake and seemed ok. I said to Tyrone to take his coat off and I wrapped around the baby.

'It was all a big shock but my basic instincts kicked in and I did what I had to do. There was a huge round of applause for me when I got to the hospital and it only hit me later that I had delivered a grandchild.'

The family arrived at the Royal Bolton Hospital shortly after the delivery where medics in the maternity unit took over.

Tyrone, who also helped deliver his daughter, said: 'We are absolutely delighted and relieved that everything went well.Â I am only just coming back down to earth if I'm honest - I don't think it has fully sunk in yet. It was an amazing experience.'

Jenny, who is due to leave hospital with and  Natasha today, thanked her mother for 'heroically' stepping in.

She said: 'My mum did an amazing job. I never expected it to happen so quickly, but the main thing is that Natasha is okay.'

Owner of Metro Taxis, Nick Astley, said: 'I've been in the taxi business for 30 years and I've never seen anything like this.

'This has never happened in one of my vehicles, but I am absolutely over the moon for the family.'
