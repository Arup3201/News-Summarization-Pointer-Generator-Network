A probe into whether a controversial police and crime commissioner was properly insured during a car crash has been widened amid claims an investigating officer was obstructed.

Ann Barnes, who earns £85,000-a-year as Kent's crime tsar, was driving her Mercedes sports car when she was involved in a collision in Dartford two months ago.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is already probing whether she committed a criminal offence by not having proper insurance to cover business use of her own car.

But today the police watchdog said its team is now examining whether a police officer was 'obstructed in the execution of their duty' when initial inquiries into her insurance cover were being made by her force, Kent Police.

Mrs Barnes’s latest troubles began on September 16 when her soft-top Mercedes crashed into another car and then a tree as she drove to a meeting in Dartford. 

She suffered only minor injuries and later tweeted: ‘Not feeling too bright today, but OK.’ 

If Mrs Barnes is prosecuted on a charge of driving without insurance, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence.

An IPCC spokesman said: 'The IPCC is investigating whether the police and crime commissioner for Kent, Ann Barnes, may have committed a criminal offence by not having in place appropriate insurance to cover business use of her own car when she was involved in a road traffic accident on 16 September 2014.

'The investigation will also determine how long the relevant insurance was not in place, if that is the case, and how many miles the PCC travelled on business use while uninsured.

'The IPCC is also investigating whether a police constable was obstructed in the execution of their duty when initial inquiries into the PCC's insurance cover were being made by Kent Police.'

The office for Mrs Barnes, who was shaken but uninjured in the crash, said no comment would be made on the latest update from the IPCC until after its investigation had ended.

Ann Barnes has faced calls to resign and has at times been widely ridiculed since she took office in 2012.

Her first major gaffe came when she appointed Paris Brown, then aged 17, as Britain's first youth crime commissioner.

But Paris Brown later resigned from the £15,000-a-year job after making offensive comments on her Twitter feed.

She wrote the offensive messages on her personal Twitter account, which also included boasts about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs.

In trouble: Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes with her 'Onion' diagram explaining police priorities, but when asked to explain what it meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea' 

Repeat: The Cutting Edge documentary producer also asked her to name crimes towards the outer rings of the onion and again said, 'no idea'

Pressure: The storm over the documentary culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'.

Then later Miss Brown's replacement was temporarily suspended over allegations of a relationship with a married former councillor. 

On her documentary: 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people better understand the role of police and crime commissioner. It is very complex and there are lots of challenges. Unfortunately I don't think the programme did that and I'm deeply sorry'. 

When asked about  her job:'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not 
the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It's
 a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there 
are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job 
description.'

On
 what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell 
you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion 
(the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - 
everything's important.' 

On
 her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is 
money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's 
not my image.' Mrs Barnes was then seen driving her personal Mercedes.

On resignation of Paris Brown: 'I was not recruiting an angel. I was not recruiting a police officer. I was recruiting a young person, warts and all. It is personally sad for Paris and her family'

In June Mrs Barnes said she was 'deeply sorry' for her 'toe-curling' appearance on a fly-on-the-wall television documentary about her job - but refused to quit.

She was filmed saying she had 'no idea' what her taxpayer-funded job entailed in an hour-long Channel Four show branded a 'disaster from start to finish'.

Mrs Barnes was widely criticised for her performance on Meet The Police Commissioner where she was compared to David Brent and accused of making Kent Police a 'laughing stock'.

The storm culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'.

The documentary, aired on May 29, showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1 and bringing her dogs into the office.

In one clip Mrs Barnes was seen drawing an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises.

But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.'

She is then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that he had 'no idea'. 

The documentary, aired on May 29, showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1' and bringing her dogs into the office.

She said: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' 

Turned sour: Ann Barnes appointed Paris Brown as Britain's first youth crime commissioner but she resigned after it emerged she boasted about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs online

But later in the documentary she then pulled up at her office in her top of the range soft-top Mercedes.

In one scene she was also filmed painting her 'flaky nails'.
