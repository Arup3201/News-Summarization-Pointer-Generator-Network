The Germans are still bleary-eyed and they’ve just rolled out of bed to see the World Cup trophy knocked over on the floor, sticky with spillages from last night’s steins.

A sharp pain is spreading from temple to temple; the tongue is dry, throat coarse. There is a sick, dull feeling in the pit of the stomach from a 4am kebab. As hangovers go, World Cup ones can be the worst.

Three wins from their seven games since Mario Gotze scored in stoppage time against Argentina to lift football’s greatest prize - two of those against against Scotland and Gibraltar - and this one is proving particularly hard to shake off.

Germany have struggled for results following their 2014 World Cup victory last summer

They have not been helped by the loss of influential captain Philipp Lahm through retirement, or that his successor to the armband Bastian Schweinsteiger, another key figure in Brazil 2014, has been out injured since.

His return to the squad for their draw with Australia, through which he sat on the bench, and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia, has been welcomed by manager Joachim Low. 

‘We need him on the field and outside as well,’ Low said. ‘It's a great benefit for us to have him back.’

He could be the strong coffee they need to wake up after defeat by Poland and a draw with Ireland in their group means, on current form, they are heading towards disaster, admittedly still a long way in the distance.

Bayern Munich star Thomas Muller is one of the few Germany players to maintain his fine form

Thomas Muller has continued where he left off, their five-goal World Cup top scorer netting four times since, but he is one of the few to maintain last summer’s form. He is clearly one of those annoying people who get up after the night before and are out of the house before anyone else is awake.

The Germans have prided themselves on bringing through youngsters and Low has handed 74 players their debuts since he took over in 2006, during which time he led them to runner-up in Euro 2008, third in the 2010 World Cup and also to the semi-finals of Euro 2012. Yet in their most recent squad he named 16 of the side who featured in the World Cup and invited no newcomers.

Low has already been backed beyond France 2016 to stay in charge until after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and is adamant they can build on their achievements. 

‘It was a decision where my heart and my mind both said yes,’ Low said, on signing a new contract earlier this month.

‘We waited a long time for the success that we had in Brazil and we all want to experience that again. We have the prerequisites to achieve it once more.’

His assistant Thomas Schneider and goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke have also extended their stay with him.

The main additions Low has made to the squad are those returning from long-term injuries. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been brought back into fold following 14 months out with a back injury. Defender Holger Badstuber missed two years with consecutive knee injuries and has returned. So too midfielder Marco Reus after his ankle ligament tear ruled him out of playing in Brazil.

Low has been experimenting in recent months. Against Australia, he tried a three-man defence of Benedikt Howedes, Shkodran Mustafi and Badstuber, who had not played together before and clearly struggled.

Lahm, one of the best full backs and defensive midfielders in the game, was always going to be difficult to replace, and that will be a key test for Low.

If the World Cup last summer is still looking a little fuzzy for Germany, the future is far from clear either.
