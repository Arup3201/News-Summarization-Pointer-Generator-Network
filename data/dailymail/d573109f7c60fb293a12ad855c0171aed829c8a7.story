'Useful and funny':The cover of the new 2014 Old Farmer's Almanac publication which was released on Tuesday

Brace yourselves for a freezing winter.

At least, that is according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac.

The 222-year-old periodical, which is believed to be the oldest continuously published periodical in the US, has predicted 'colder-than-average temperatures' this winter with 'higher-than-average snowfall'.

The Dublin, New Hampshire-based Almanac, which released its 2014 edition today, says a drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns are the reasons behind the cooler temperatures.

‘This winter will bring bitter cold and heavy snow across most of the US,’ says the publication, which dubs itself as 'useful, with a pleasant degree of humour'.

It
 says the cold weather will affect every region of the US except for the
 lower Great Lakes, the upper Midwest and the northern states of the 
Northeast. 

‘Sweaters 
and snow shovels should be unpacked early and kept close by throughout 
the season,’ said Janice Stillman, editor of the annual periodical.

Shovel time: The Old Farmer's Almanac editor, Janice Stillman, says 'sweaters and shovels should be unpacked early' this year

Snowy winter: The periodical suggests people should 'gather your jackets' to brace for the extreme temperatures

Snowball fun: There will be enough of the white stuff to keep any child occupied this winter

Success rate: The publication claims its predictions are correct based on its forecast for last year's winter

Cause of chaos: A drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns will be the cause of the extreme temperatures, according to the periodical

The Old Farmer's Almanac has also predicted the country will experience a warmer, drier spring with above-average temperatures.

It warns that drought will be a ‘problem’ during summer in several areas, such as the southern tip of Florida; from New England westward through the Lower Lakes and Upper Midwest; from Texas and Oklahoma westward through the Desert Southwest; and in the upper Pacific Northwest.

The periodical also claims there will be more rainfall than normal with an ‘active hurricane season’.

It predicts a major hurricane will make landfall on the central Gulf coast in July and several hurricanes and tropical storms will threaten Florida and the Atlantic seaboard in September next year.

Same, same: The Farmers' Almanac, which is 197 years old, has predicted a winter outlook for 2014 much the same as its older cousin's

Last month, the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac, which has been published for 197 years, said much the same.

However, some scientists have refuted the two periodicals' meteorologic assessments.

Pennsylvania State University 
meteorologist Paul Knight said that the Farmers' Almanac makes forecasts, which are so 
vague that it is difficult to assess whether they are accurate or not.

In a report published on the university's news website, Mr Knight states: 'The ability to predict events that far in advance is zero. There's no proven skill, there's no technique that's agreed upon in science to be able to do that.

In its bicentennial edition, the Almanac stated, 'neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy.'

However, according to the new 2014 edition of the Old Farmer’s Almanac, their forecast for last year’s winter was ‘nearly perfect’.

‘We were correct in our forecast temperature change from the previous winter in 15 of the 16 regions – yielding an accuracy rate greater than 94 per cent.’

And therefore, Old Farmer’s Almanac leaves its advice, as a chilling reminder: ‘Gather your jackets and light up a fire! It is going to be cold outside!’
