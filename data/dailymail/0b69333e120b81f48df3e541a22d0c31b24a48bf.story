Captain Donald Malcolm Jr lived a magnificent life, so it's only fitting that his family would choose to memorialize him in a legendary way when the 60-year-old Alaska fisherman died last month.

In an obituary published in the Homer Tribune, Malcolm's daughter Megan inspires both tears and laughter by writing that her father passed away on February 28 'nestled in the bosom of his family, while smoking, drinking whiskey and telling lies.'

'He died from complications resulting from being stubborn, refusing to go to the doctor, and raising hell for six decades. Stomach cancer also played a minor role in his demise,' Megan Malcolm added.

The obituary goes on to tell the story of Malcolm's life, starting with his upbringing in Kirkland, Washington. At the age of 19, Malcolm left his home state for Dutch Harbor, Alaska in order to realize his life's calling to 'yell at deckhands on commercial fishing boats.'

For forty years, Malcolm worked as a boat cook, mechanic, deckhand, captain and boat owner catching crab, halibut, black cod and salmon - mostly out of the Bering Sea.

It was after a crab-fishing trip that he met his wife Maureen, who he found 'in his bed' and decided to keep.

Adding intrigue to the obituary, Megan writes that 'their daughter Melissa was born "early" six months later.' 

'They decided to have a boy a couple years later, and ended up with another daughter, Megan,' the younger daughter writes of her perhaps slightly disappointing entrance into the world.

While he taught his daughters everything he knew: from how to hold their liquor to changing a car tire, Megan writes that his 'greatest joy in life was the birth of his grandson Marley, a child to whom he could impart all of his wisdom that his daughters ignored'.

'Don had a life-time love affair with Patsy Cline, Rainier beer, iceberg lettuce salads and the History Channel (which allowed him to call his wife and daughters everyday in order to relay the latest WWII facts he learned),' the obituary continues. 'He excelled at attempting home improvement projects, outsmarting rabbits, annoying the women in his life and reading every book he could get his hands on.

'His life goal was to beat his wife at Scrabble, and although he never succeeded, his dream lives on in the family he left behind.' 

After the obituary was published on  Wednesday, daughter Megan posted a link on her Facebook and wrote about the emotions behind the piece.

Author: Megan Malcolm (right) posted a link to the obituary on her Facebook and wrote that it was one of the hardest things she's ever had to do. 'However, it does allow you the chance to inject a bit of humor into an otherwise entirely awful situation' 

'Writing it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and I wouldn't wish the task on anyone. However, it does allow you the chance to inject a bit of humor into an otherwise entirely awful situation,' Megan Malcolm wrote. 

'I hope reading Papa M's obituary makes you smile and remember what an incredible man he was. He was the absolute best, and he will be missed.'

Malcolm is survived by his wife, daughters, grandson, father Donald Malcolm Sr, brothers Howard and Mike Malcolm, sisters Lisa Shumaker, Nicki White, Melinda Borg and Patsi Solano.
