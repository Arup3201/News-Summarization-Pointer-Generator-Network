Astrobiologist Abel Mendez of the 
University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo has designed a software package 
that can draw real-looking worlds based on the scientific data we receive from space telescopes  - and says Nasa gets it wrong.

Mendez's software package draws planets based on their size, distance from their parent star and chemistry - and can create 3D images that correspond to the data.

The imagery sent out when missions such as Nasa's Kepler telescope find 'exoplanets' - planets outside our solar system - is still imagined by artists. Mendez claims that his approach is more scientific.

The Scientific Exoplanets Rendereris is designed to generate 'photo-real' images of other planets - and 'draws' its reconstructions using data such as chemicals detected by space telescopes and their size and surface temperature.

Unlike 'artists reconstructions', it's all done mathematically.

Mendez said of Nasa's reconstruction of Kepler 22-b, 'I think that the Nasa image got the color right but I don’t expect clouds like that. It probably will be more featureless like Uranus or Neptune and not so good for a press release.'

Mendez's software is specially designed to reconstruct Earth-like exoplanets, either rocky or ocean in nature, but it is also able to generate visuals for gas giants and stars.

It includes the reconstruction of realistic clouds and weather effects.

The software can also be used to construct 3D models of planets for research and simulations.

The software is now in an alpha 'test' version, but will be released next year.
