A mother has described the 'heartbreaking' moment her seven-year-old daughter clung to her and sobbed as she explained how she had been taped to a chair by a teacher and assistant at her primary school. 

Rachael Regan, a classroom assistant, and Deborah McDonald, a teacher, are accused of carrying out a five-month campaign of bullying against the girl which included shutting her in a store room and tying her shoes on with string at a school in Calderdale, west Yorkshire.

The girl's mother, who cannot be named, told Bradford Crown Court her daughter rushed to her in tears and told her she had been taped to the chair with Sellotape by the two women, and made to look 'like a clown' while the rest of her class laughed at her.

The woman said her daughter 'clung to her' as she explained what had happened. 

She told the jury that her 'bubbly and outgoing' daughter, who is now nine, started to make excuses to not go to school but she did not understand why. She also told her mother she wanted to change schools. 

The jury has already heard that the girl was 'singled out and bullied' by the pair, who have also been accused of calling the child a nickname and goading her with a biscuit.

McDonald, from Halifax, and Regan, of Illingworth, West Yorkshire, each deny a charge of child cruelty.

The girl's mother told the court: '(My daughter) just came rushing out and hugged me and tears were just rolling down her face.

'It was just so heartbreaking to see her like that because (she) is so bubbly and outgoing and I have never seen my daughter so upset. 

'She just clung to me for dear life.”

The woman explained how her daughter told her she had been taped to a chair by Regan.

A taped interview with the girl recorded her telling police officers she thought neither McDonald (left) or Regan (right) liked her. She said that Regan was not a very nice person and was 'always mean' to her 

The girl's mother added: 'I said "How did you feel?" and she said "Very upset."'

'She said "They all thought I was funny. I was the clown. They all laughed at me."'

The girl’s mother said she had previously spoken to the school after her daughter told her a teacher had stuck Post-it notes to her thumbs to stop her sucking them. She told the court her daughter also claimed that one of the teachers tied her pumps on with string and put her favourite doll in a storeroom.

The jury was shown a video of a police interview with the girl.

In the film she told officers that Regan, 43, and McDonald, 41, did not like her.

She said: '(Regan’s) not a very nice person. Because she likes everybody else except for me. I don’t know why she doesn’t like me.

'She’s always nice to the other children in class but she’s always mean to me.'

When the police interviewer asked the girl how she felt about Regan, she replied: 'Very, very, very angry.'

The child told a jury at Bradford Crown Court that she felt Regan did not like her and liked everyone else 

She told police that she and McDonald liked each other but said she was sometimes not nice because she would shout at her. 

The girl described having her shoes tied on by Regan with string. She said: 'She has put string around me pumps. It were horrible, just because my feet are small, size 9, and somebody has got me size 10.

'Everyone was laughing because they kept coming undone.'

She also described being shut in a store cupboard, which she called 'dirty' and 'dusty.'

Earlier in the trial the jury were told about an incident when McDonald allegedly dropped the girl’s doll into a drawer and kicked it shut, and of another occasion when Regan allegedly took a photo of the girl of the wall and ripped it up in front of her.

The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. The court has previously heard the two women were jointly to blame.

Police arrested the pair in February after the girl's mother complained to the school. 

The trial continues.
