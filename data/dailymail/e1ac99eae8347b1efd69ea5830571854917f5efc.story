Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan lost power when Sandy roared through, knocking out a full 25 percent of transmission sites, cutting out their cell phone service, and making communication with loved ones extremely difficult.

Because of the complete lack of service in many areas of New York and no power with which to charge their smartphones, the usually forlorn pay phones have been experiencing an unexpected surge in popularity in an era where wireless is king.

In an effort to ease communication hang-ups, rivals AT&T and T-Mobile have teamed together, opening up their networks to customers of the other company in New York and New Jersey where their services were hurt by power outages and flooding.

A full quarter of transmission sites in the tri-state area were knocked out by Sandy, according to the Federal Communications Commission, and it is unclear how many have since been restored since Monday night.

To alleviate some stress from the storm’s survivors, AT&T and T-Mobile said in a statement they had reached a network roaming agreement and that customers would not see any change to their current rate plans as a result of the roaming agreements.

Both operators use the same GSM wireless technology, which means that their phones can work on each other’s network. T-Mobile USA is a unit of Deutsche Telekom.

Six percent of Verizon’s service area was affected as of Tuesday and around 20 percent of Verizon’s network was down, the New York Times reported.

A spokesperson for the FCC said Tuesday that the outages could ‘get worse before they get better.’New Yorkers who were left literally and figuratively in the dark have relied on old-fashioned pay phones across the city to get in touch with family and friends. Many people from younger generations were unsure of how to use them, and payphones in certain neighborhoods, like Lower East Side and East Village, are easy targets for graffiti and misuse.  

Despite their dubious cleanliness, pay phones’ designs allow them to survive most natural disasters, the Wall Street Journal notes. They are positioned high enough to avoid flood waters and often have glass stalls to shield them from the elements.

Many city dwellers told the paper they hadn’t used the antiquated phones since the blackout of 2003, or the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Television marketer Jordan Spak, 32, was one such Manhattanite who relied on pay phones after he was cut off from his other electronic devices.

‘It’s funny what’s hiding in plain sight,’ he told the Journal. ‘It’s invisible, but when you need it,’ it’s there.
