Broadcaster Mark Pougatch was named as ITV Sport's new lead football presenter, taking over from Chiles

Not 100% true - Chiles still currently has a contract at ITV... but hilarious, nonetheless. 

Nowadays, news spreads fast. In fact, Mexico have heard all about it. 

NB: It is unclear whether this is really the reaction of England manager Roy Hodgson 

News breaks at the Isle of Wight Festival. Cue celebrations.

Even unrelated, this clip is funny. Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho didn't appear to like Chiles either 

You can see where we're going with these... Rotherham boss Steve Evans is relieved. 

That infamous Paolo di Canio reaction makes the cut... 

Alan Partridge fist-pumps at the news of Chiles' immediate departure 

A musical vine shows an American celebration at Chiles' expense. One guy particularly goes for it. 

We've had our fair share of celebrations. Here, wrestler Kurt Angle is overcome with emotion.

This picture should come with a warning, really. A whole family of Adrian Chiles'. Enough said. 

After a poor run of form, Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce needed some cheering up. 

Where would we be without a rendition of Pharrell's Happy, eh? Clap along...
