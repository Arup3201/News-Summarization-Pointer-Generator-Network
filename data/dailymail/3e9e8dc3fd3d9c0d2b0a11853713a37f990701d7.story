Manchester United defender Paddy McNair is in line to make his Northern Ireland debut this month, having been included in a 27-man squad for matches against Scotland and Finland.

Manager Michael O'Neill has convened a familiar group for the friendly at Hampden on March 25 and the Euro 2016 qualifier that follows at Windsor Park on March 29, with the 19-year-old set for his first senior appearance.

He was an unused substitute against Romania in November but with O'Neill set to rotate his squad in the first fixture, McNair can expect to add another landmark moment to his breakthrough season.

McNair's United team-mate Jonny Evans retains his place in the squad despite his stop-start season taking another turn for the worse with his six-game domestic ban for spitting at Papiss Cisse.

Doncaster's Luke McCullough is also included alongside veteran defenders Gareth McAuley, Aaron Hughes and Chris Baird, meaning Hull's Alex Bruce again misses out.

Brentford winger Stuart Dallas is another who may benefit from a run-out in Glasgow having returned to the squad.

Brentford winger Stuart Dallas (centre) is bidding to win his first Northern Ireland cap since 2011 

Dallas won his first and only cap against Wales in 2011's Carling Nations Cup and withdrew from his previous call-up due to injury.

Shane Ferguson, on loan at Rangers from Newcastle, is the only natural left-back but is expected to withdraw with a knee injury.

That could yet open the door for the absent Daniel Lafferty, who has been starved of first-team football at Burnley but has recently joined Rotherham on loan.

Kyle Lafferty, who has three goals in four Euro 2016 qualifiers so far, leads the forward unit and will travel from Turkish outfit Caykur Rizespor.

But there was no place for Martin Paterson, on loan with Major League Soccer franchise Orlando City.

Northern Ireland squad: R Carroll (Notts County), A Mannus (St Johnstone), M McGovern (Hamilton), A Hughes (Brighton), C Baird (West Brom), G McAuley (West Brom), J Evans (Man Utd), C Cathcart (Watford), S Ferguson (Rangers, loan) C McLaughlin (Fleetwood), L McCullough (Doncaster), P McNair (Man Utd), S Davis (Southampton), C Brunt (West Brom), S Clingan (Kilmarnock), C Evans (Blackburn), O Norwood (Reading), R McLaughlin (Liverpool), B Reeves (MK Dons), P McCourt (Notts County, loan), S Dallas (Brentford), K Lafferty (Rizespor, loan), N McGinn (Aberdeen), J Ward (Derby County), J Magennis (Kilmarnock), B McKay (Wigan Athletic), Will Grigg (MK Dons).
