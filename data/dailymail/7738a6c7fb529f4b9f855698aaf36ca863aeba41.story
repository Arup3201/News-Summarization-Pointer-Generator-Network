This amazing footage literally captures a birds-eye view of London after an eagle flew over the city - with a video camera on its back.

The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for over 50 years, was released from the top of the Golden Gallery of St Paul’s Cathedral.

In the clip, which lasts 20 seconds, the impressive raptor can be seen landing in front of an impressed audience, at the base of the city’s famous Tower Bridge.

An endangered eagle captured footage from a literal bird's eye view of the city of London in amazing video

The bird flew from St Paul's Cathedral to Tower Bridge with a camera fastened to its back

The eagle then flew along the Thames before gently alighting on the arm of his handler

During the flight, the bird of prey was able to capture breathtaking footage of the capital with the high-spec camera mounted on its back.

The eagle flew over the Thames before gently alighting onto the arm of his handler Jacques Olivier Travers.

As part of the incredible stunt, Sony have provided a number of cameras to FREEDOM, a charity attempting to reintroduce the rare white-tailed eagle back into the wild.

Additional videos filmed by the impressive bird of prey will be released on the bird’s Youtube channel over the coming days.

The majestic bird also completed a flight from ArcelorMittal in Mayfair

The entire project was to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the IUCN's Red List and raise awareness for critically endangered species

Perched atop City Hall, the eagle was filmed by Sony-provided cameras, donated to animal charity FREEDOM

Jacques-Olivier Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected. For many years, I have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider.'

He has had a passion for the birds since the age of 12.

'I was given small chicks from a nest and recommended feeding with milk. But they died a few days later,' he added.

Now his dream is to reintroduce the white-tailed eagle into the wild.

Part of a larger campaign for IUCN, there will also be an art installation at London's Old Sorting House 

The eagle's handler, Jacques-Olivier Travers, said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected'

Jacques-Olivier admits that one of his dreams is to reintroduce the White-Tailed Eagle back into the wild

He explained: 'For reintroduction and conservation to be successful we need the public to support it.'

The project is part of a greater campaign to raise awareness for The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List 50th Anniversary.

An international contemporary art exhibition called Here Today… will also be held in London's Old Sorting Office from November 25 in support of the cause.

The exhibition will showcase specially commissioned interactive installations and art focused around endangered species from several renowned artists. 

The project, its hoped, will help people who feel disconnected from nature to remember how important it is

It's hoped that the high-spec camera footage will allow researchers to accurately document the eagle's flight patterns to assist in their reintroduction into the wild

It is hoped the HDR-AZ1 Action Cam Mini mounted on the animal’s backs will allow researchers to accurately document their flight and prosperity as they are re-introduced into the wild.

The project also hopes to help people, who feel disconnected from nature whilst living in urban environments, and forget the impact their lives can have on the world outside.

FREEDOM will use the footage to study the behaviour of the eagles to understand what needs to be done to prepare the birds ahead the full re-introduction program.
