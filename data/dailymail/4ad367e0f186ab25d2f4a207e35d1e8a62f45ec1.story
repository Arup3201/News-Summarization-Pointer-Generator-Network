A cosy red wooden hut nestled in the middle of the Hawaiian countryside is on sale for an eye-watering $2.5million.

The property is described a 'slice of paradise' with vistas onto the pacific and the Laupahoehoe countryside.

At only 484 square feet, the dimensions may be a little cosy, but the price tag may be helped by the 20-acres of lush Hawaiian countryside that come with it.

'Slice of paradise': This Hawaiian beach-shack is on the market for $2.5million. Though it is only 484 square feet it comes with 20 acres of Laupahoehoe countryside

The property's international agent, Sotheby's, describes the tiny home as an 'exclusive hideaway'.

'Whales, dolphins, and turtles play just off shore providing 
occupants with endless entertainment,' its entry reads.

'Fish, snorkel, dive, lounge, or 
sit around a bonfire as your catch cooks, all additional options.'

'Surrounded by 20 acres currently grazed by cattle, this beach cottage 
has a wonderful island atmosphere unable to be duplicated by anything in
the state.'

Set in a 'jungle canyon' the home has its own a private access road and rocky beach.

Property on the Big Island can command high prices but this wooden home, which is described as coming with a 'full kitchen' but little 
else, is like nothing seen before.

However, beach huts are increasingly commanding bigger and better price-tags.

In the U.K. a six-foot wide hut went on sale for £245,000 (around $400,000) in South Devon in November.

Though it perhaps couldn't compete with the countryside of Laupahoehoe, it had a 'under floor heating, a marble wet room, wireless internet, and electric windows which automatically close when it rains'.

Four times as much, the Hawaii cottage also comes with two carports underneath the property and a 'large open common space'.

Laupahoehoe is currently home to only 581 people with a median age of 45 and has an average income of $30,000 per household.

The name means 'Leaf Lava' named after leaf-shaped lava formed on its beaches.

The tiny town of Laupahoehoe sits on the slopes of Mauna Kea, a volcano which is the highest point in all of Hawaii reaching 33,500 ft from its ocean base - making it more than twice the size of Everest.
