Paedophile Jimmy Savile may have stayed in a caravan on school grounds during a roadshow tour in the Seventies, it has been revealed.

Lawyers investigating sex abuse claims are now looking into Savile's activities at the unnamed school, in West Bridgford, Notts. where it is thought he stayed during the height of his TV fame.

The lawyers are also looking into allegations that Savile would often park his van off the A1 in Grantham and trawl the area looking for victims.

Lawyers are investigating claims that Savile parked a caravan on the grounds of a school in West Bridgford, Notts. while touring the UK in the 1970s

Last year a Nottingham woman claimed she was molested by Savile during a
 roadshow at Saxondale Hospital, near Radcliffe-on-Trent in 1971.

In 2012 it was also revealed that Scotland Yard investigated the pervert
 for molesting a young girl in his mobile home at BBC Television Centre.

In total seven complaints made to Notts Police about Savile have been referred to Operation Yewtree.

In 2012 a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted in the motor home (pictured) while it was parked at the BBC Television Centre in London

Emma Jones, from law firm Leigh Day which is acting on behalf of some the alleged victims, said: 'We are interested in Savile's activities in south Nottingham and his apparent interest in schools and hospitals between Grantham and Nottingham.

'Anyone with any knowledge should come forward to the police so a full picture of his crimes can be established.'

A report into the alleged abuse of 1,000 children by Savile on BBC premises is also expected to be published in the middle of the year.

Law firm Leigh Day are also looking into allegations that Savile parked his van just off of the A1 near Grantham and then prowled the area looking for victims

The NHS is carrying out its own investigation looking into Savile's activities at 32 hospitals across the country.

Savile, who presented Top Of The Pops and Jim’ll Fix It, died aged 84 in October 2011, a year before the allegations were broadcast in an  ITV documentary.

A report by Scotland Yard and the NSPCC found he used his celebrity status to ‘hide in plain sight’, with 214 criminal offences recorded against him across 28 police forces.

The report also revealed that Savile abused his victims at medical sites including hospitals, mental health units – and even a hospice.
