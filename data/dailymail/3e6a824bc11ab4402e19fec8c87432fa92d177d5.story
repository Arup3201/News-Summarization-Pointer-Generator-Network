A 17-year-old girl who was obsessed with the Columbine High School massacre wrote about 'picking off' her classmates 'one by one' and blowing up the cafeteria, police have said.

Administrators at Radnor High School in Pennsylvania alerted police after learning the senior had allegedly been scrawling the terrifying plans in her notebooks.

The girl wrote about killing a teacher and other students before injuring herself, said Radnor Township Police Superintendent William Colarulo, as he shared the journal excerpts on Monday. 

'I could be the first female shooter,' the student, who has not been named because she is a juvenile, wrote in her journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. 'I'm homicidal, and I'm fine with that.'

Terrifying: Police shared pages out of a teenager's notebook that allegedly detail how she wanted to attack the school in a Columbine massacre-like attack. She is now undergoing psychiatric evaluation

Sick: The journal described how she wanted to 'pierce kids around me' and 'flood the halls with corpses'

Colarulo said that the teenager was obsessed with serial killers and read a lot about torture, ABC6 reported. Her journal excerpts detailed her alleged plan of attack on the school.

'I want to trap them, pick them off one by one,' she wrote. 'Blow up the cafeteria, shoot everyone in classrooms.

'Imagine the power, the bullets leaving the gun with a loud bang, piercing kids around me, the way they collapse, their blood splattering the floor... the screams.'

Another page was filled with large capital letters reading: 'I am fire, I am flames. I exude danger, you should fear me, I am dangerous, you better believe me, you have no idea what I can do.'  

Concern: Radnor Township Police Superintendent William Colarulo said the girl's locker and home had been searched and no weapons had been found. He said she is 'getting the help she needs'

'Obsessed': She also wrote a letter to the parents of one of the Columbine shooters, Dylan Klebold, saying she had read his journal and 'I connected very strongly with your son emotionally'

'I could be the first female shooter... I'm homicidal, and I'm fine with that'

'I am about to get very violent... So close to exploding'

'I want to trap them, pick them off one by one. Blow up the cafeteria, maybe. Shoot everyone in classrooms, but how do I trap people. Leave survivors? Or nah? I kinda want to' 

'Imagine the power, the bullets leaving the gun with a loud bang, piercing kids around me, the way they collapse, their blood splattering the floor... the screams'

'I am fire, I am flames. I exude danger, you should fear me, I am dangerous, you better believe me, you have no idea what I can do'

Other pages showed letters she had written to the parents of one of the Columbine killers, Dylan Klebold.

Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, killed a teacher and 12 students before taking their lives during the shooting in Littleton, Colorado in April 1999. They also injured 21 people.

In the letter, the girl wrote that she had read his journal and 'connected very strongly with your son emotionally'.

'We would be remiss if we didn't take these threats seriously,' Colarulo said at the press conference. 

'There are always warning signs. If you want to go back and reference the Columbine incident, there were numerous warning signs that went ignored, that went unnoticed and nobody took the proper action and made the report.'

He added that students were not in any danger. After receiving the call from the school, police searched the student's home and her school locker and no weapons were found.

The girl has a history of treatment for 'psychological issues' and is undergoing psychiatric evaluation but will remain in custody, he said. Her parents are cooperating with police.

'She is getting the help she needs,' he said.

Debbie Singer, a parent of a junior at Radnor High, said that students were terrified about returning to school.

'It's very said and it's sad for the girl,' Singer said. 'The rumor was this was going to happen at the pep rally.'
