Maternity units are forced to shut their doors temporarily across England more than 1,000 times a year, it has been revealed.

In one instance, expectant mothers were told to travel up to 65 miles to give birth because their preferred hospital had closed its doors.

And Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust stopped accepting new patients 353 times alone in 2011 and 2012.

Closure: NHS maternity wards have been forced to close their doors more than 1,000 times a year because of soaring demand

The huge number of maternity unit closures has been put down to the high birth rate which currently stands at 688,000 a year - the highest level in more than 40 years.

The birth rate has soared by as much as 50 per cent in some areas over the last 10 years, and across England as a whole it has gone up by 22 per cent. The Royal College of Midwives called earlier this year for an extra 5,000 midwives to cope with the pressure.

Campaign groups said that being forced to travel to a neighbouring hospital - even if it is just a few miles away - can be highly stressful for mothers in labour.

NHS trusts typically close maternity units for only a few hours at a time, although in some instances closures have lasted for up to three days, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

On three occasions, women who were supposed to give birth at East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, were instead told they would have to go to Portsmouth, 65 miles away, or deliver their child at home.

Closures: Leeds General Infirmary which, along with a neighbouring hospital, was forced to close its maternity unit 353 times over a two year period

Shut: St James' Hospital, Leeds, which along with the other hospital in the city was shut 353 times. When one closed its doors, maternity patients were routinely sent to the other

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act to the Sunday Telegraph revealed 66 NHS Trusts closed their doors a total of 1,795 times in 2011 and 2012.

A number of Trusts did not respond to the request - raising the spectre that the total number of maternity unit closures could be far higher, and comfortably in excess of 1,000 a year.

Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, told the newspaper: 'It is disconcerting to hear that so many hospitals are unable to cope safely with the number of women arriving at their doors.

'For many birthing woman, being told your chosen place of birth is not available is stressful and can have worrying implications, such as travelling in labour.

'It is important that commissioners monitor these suspensions and look at ways to prevent them in order to ensure that women are as safe and stress free as possible.'

A lack of capacity and a shortage of suitably-qualified staff were the main reasons given for closing maternity units.

A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed that they closed their doors 353 times in 2011 and 2012 at St James' Hospital, Leeds, and Leeds General Infirmary.

When one unit is at full capacity mothers-to-be are often sent to the other.

However, the Trust was forced to shut both to incoming patients on four occasions over the two-year period.

A spokesperson from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Inevitably at times demand can be unpredictable and if one location gets too busy we have the ability to divert mums-to-be to our neighbouring facility to ensure safe and effective care with the minimum of disruption.'

University Hospitals Leicester NHS Trust were forced to shut their doors 142 times in 2011 and 122 times in 2012, on the back of soaring demand.

They have seen the local birth rate soar from 8,800 in 2002-03 to 10,800 in 2012-13. The NHS Trust operate three maternity units, and when one closes its doors they simply send patients to another.

Judith Foxon, matron in women’s services at Leicester’s Hospitals, said: 'Unfortunately, when demand is exceptionally high we have to divert women to other local maternity units.'

Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, who ran maternity units at three hospitals, shut their doors 166 times in total in 2011.

However, they have not had to shut their doors at all since September 2011 when all childbirth services were moved to Tunbridge Wells.

A spokesman said: 'The Trust has had no maternity ward closures in the last 23 months and as such this is not a true or accurate reflection of services provided recently or at any point in the last two years.'

Bill Kilvington, Associate Director for Women’s and Children’s Health, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'We deeply regret any time the maternity unit has to refer patients elsewhere.

'We have invested in midwives and a new birthing unit so we can now offer homely en-suite rooms, each with its own birth pool and double bed for mums expecting an uncomplicated birth; a home birth with experienced midwives who can come out to support the birth and a Delivery Suite with comfortable rooms, and a birth pool if you need to be under the supervision of a doctor during labour.'

An NHS spokesman said: 'The NHS now has 800 more midwives than it did in 2010, and there are a record 5,000 midwives in training who will qualify over the next three years.

'We realise there has been a long history of a shortage of midwives but this is a situation that NHS England is keen to address.

'As a workforce issue, it is for the GP led Clinical Commissioning Groups to look at their provision and to commission the services locally to ensure adequate cover.

'Most women already have a choice and one-to-one maternity care, and we are working closely with the Royal College of Midwives to ensure that personalised, one-to-one maternity care is available for every woman across the country.'
