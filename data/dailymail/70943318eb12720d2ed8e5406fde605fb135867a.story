Unpopular: Eating Brussels sprouts could help those who are not eating five portions of fruit or vegetables a day, dieticians say

They may not taste great, but just one Brussels sprout provides enough folic acid to last all day, say dieticians.

A daily helping of the traditional Christmas fare could boost the number of Britons eating five portions of fruit and vegetables, according to a new survey.

It shows four out of five people fail to consume the recommended daily amount, which may leave them at risk of vitamin deficiencies.

The average intake is just three portions and a third of the nation manages only one or two servings a day.

But the poll of 3,000 people found many in denial about their five-a-day intake, with one in three claiming to eat a varied and balanced diet.

Nutritionist Dr Emma Derbyshire, from the Health Supplements Information Service (HSIS) which carried out the poll, said anyone who averages only three portions of fruit or vegetables a day is at real risk of missing out on important vitamins and minerals.

The B-vitamin folic acid, for example, keeps blood healthy, preventing anaemia, and is vital for women in the early stages of pregnancy and planning to conceive.

She said ‘There is no doubt that, with the exception of vitamin D and folate, most of us should be able to get all the nutrients we need from a healthy and balanced diet.

'But all the evidence shows that very few people are actually eating the healthy, balanced diet needed to ensure the daily intake of vitamins and minerals we need to maintain good health.

'Our bodies cannot store folic acid so we need at least 0.2mg in our diet every day.

'To ensure this intake you would need to eat roughly two mugs of peas or 1.3 Brussels sprouts’ she added.

The Department of Health recommends that any woman thinking of having a baby, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and all children aged six months to five years should take a daily supplement.

Despite clear evidence that taking folic acid before conception and during the first weeks of pregnancy cuts the risk of birth defects, two out of five people questioned thought it was not safe for mums-to-be to take any kind of food supplements.

Dr Derbyshire said ‘These findings are very worrying. A healthy diet during pregnancy is essential for both mother and child.

‘There is no doubt that folic acid helping to reduce the incidence of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.

‘There is also evidence that taking a multivitamin during pregnancy reduces the odds of having a low birth weight baby.

‘This could have a life-long impact on health as low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes and heart disease as an adult.’

The findings on fruit and vegetable consumption come after European figures show on average Britons eat 258g of fruit and vegetables a day, little more than half the 400g recommended in international guidelines.

‘This research data is really very alarming’ said Dr Derbyshire.

‘It is clear, from this latest survey, that around 78 per cent of people are finding it difficult to consume at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.

‘As a result, there is a significant dietary gap which needs to be bridged to help people maintain their health’ she added.
