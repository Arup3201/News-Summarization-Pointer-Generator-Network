Angela Merkel's German government 'nearly collapsed' in a row over who should be the country's new president, it was claimed today.

Former East German rights activist Joachim Gauck was eventually backed for the presidency, despite Mrs Merkel's deep reservations.

The chancellor caved in to pressure from the Free Democrat Party (FDP) led by Philipp Roesler during tense negotiations.

Mrs Merkel warned Mr Roesler that he 
was putting the coalition at risk by backing Mr Gauck, German newspaper 
Bild reported. The German leader eventually caved in and backed the 
candidate who she publicly opposed two years ago.

But yesterday Mrs Merkel praised Mr Gauck, a rights activist who grew up in East Germany, as he was announced as the parties' choice to be the new president.

Mr Gauck told a press conference: 
'What moves me the most, is that a man who was still born during the 
gloomy, dark war, who grew up and lived 50 years in a dictatorship ... 
is now called to become the head of state.

'This is of course a very special day in my life.'

All smiles: Mrs Merkel, right, had opposed Joachim Gauck as the candidate for president but caved in to opposition from her coalition partners

The new president was chosen after Christian Wulff was 
forced to resign in disgrace after failing in a bid to gag newspapers 
who accused him of seeking political favours.

Mr Wulff, a close political ally of 
Mrs Merkel, stood down after becoming embroiled in a home loan scandal 
involving more than £430,000 received from a businessman friend’s wife.

The claims are being investigated by prosecutors.

If Merkel had not backed down and 
agreed to support Mr Gauck, she would have faced a long fight which would 
have become a major distraction as she tries to tackle the eurozone debt
 crisis.

Stood firm: Philipp Roesler, leader of the Free Democrat Party insisted that Mr Gauck must be president during tense negotiations

Mr Gauck, 72, is now almost certain to succeed Christian Wulff, Merkel's hand-picked choice for president in 2010.

She
 pushed through his election at the time despite the fact many Germans 
and the leading opposition parties wanted Gauck to become president.

He was nominated by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens for the largely-ceremonial post.

But as the row brewed over his 
appointment, Michael Kretschmer, a lawmaker from Merkel's CDU accused 
coalition partners the FDP of a 'massive breach of trust' that would 
have serious consequences for future cooperation.

Bavarian Finance Minister Markus Soeder of the Christian Social Union accused the FDP of 'extortion'.

A senior member of the FDP, who asked to remain anonymous said the talks had been 'on a knife's edge'.

The FDP has slumped to just two per cent in the opinion polls as they have been pushed around by rival parties.

Mr Gauck, a Protestant pastor, was a leading figure in the peaceful protest movement that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

He was one of a number of pastors who supported the protests that ultimately brought down the East German regime, setting the stage for the reunification of Germany in 1990.          

After the Berlin Wall fell, Mr Gauck ran the state-run archives on the Stasi, earning recognition for exposing the crimes of the dreaded East German secret police. 

While the president has no power over policy, the person in the role has been seen as a source of moral guidance and can influence the political debate by giving speeches.
