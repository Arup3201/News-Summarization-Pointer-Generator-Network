Expensive: The former prime minister was paid $250,000 (£157,000) for an hour in Dubai

Tony Blair took his earning power to astonishing new heights yesterday when he pocketed £150,000 for just an hour’s work.

The former Prime Minister, who is said to have amassed a £50 million fortune since leaving office, was paid the staggering sum for conducting two 30-minute events in Dubai.

His fee for talking about global affairs in the fabulously wealthy Gulf state worked out at £2,602 per minute.

His work as a Middle East ‘peace envoy’ is unpaid but his latest trip to the region was as guest of honour of Arabian Business magazine, which is presided over by its chairman, journalist and BBC broadcaster Andrew Neil.

Mr Blair, who was accompanied by his wife Cherie, gave a 30-minute speech on Monday on global and economic affairs to 600 of the Gulf region’s key business leaders at the newly-opened JW Marriott Marquis hotel in Dubai, the world’s tallest hotel.

His appearance was arranged to mark the magazine’s business achievement awards.

That was followed yesterday by another 30-minute engagement on stage with Mr Neil at the annual Arabian Business forum, also in the JW Marriott.

A source said he was being paid a $250,000 fee - equal to £156,124. In addition, a source said his team of eight was being put up in the finest Dubai hotels and entertained with no expense spared by their Middle Eastern hosts.

Mr Blair was offered accommodation in the £7,140-a-night penthouse suite of the JW Marriott but demanded to be moved, according to sources.

The hotel has already won accolades as a feat of engineering while its restaurants and bars have garnered regional awards. The penthouse suite features two bedrooms and a dedicated butler to cater to any whim but the offer was not taken up.

Luxury: A source said the entourage of eight have been put up in luxury Dubai hotels including JW Marriott

A source said: ‘He felt it was too 
accessible to the public, who could get to it using the common area 
lifts. He wanted something away from any public access for security 
reasons.’ He is now staying at another luxury hotel nearby.

A spokesman for Mr Blair last night refused to comment on his fee and denied he had asked to be moved for security reasons.

Host: The event is run by political broadcaster Andrew Neil who presents BBC's Daily Politics

The spokesman said: ‘He does not have an “eight-strong entourage” - he is travelling with his wife and one member of staff and his usual security team.

‘Where he is staying has nothing to do with security - he’s not at the Marriott because he’s staying with Mrs Blair, who is doing an event for her foundation in a different hotel. We don’t comment on fees.’

In his speech yesterday, Mr Blair told the audience he first visited Dubai in 1976 as a young lawyer when there was ‘nothing but sand and a few buildings. There was sand everywhere.’

He pledged his support for Dubai’s bid to host the World Expo in 2020, adding: ‘What has driven the changes here is imaginative leadership determined to open this city out to the world.

‘What’s been created here is something powerful.’

The business forum usually attracts Arab royalty. In previous years, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, and King Abdullah II of Jordan have attended.

In September, it emerged Mr Blair had been using a £30million private jet to travel around the world in his role as a public speaker and business consultant.

As Prime Minister, he was refused a presidential-style jet because it was too expensive but he now seems to be paying for his own private £7,000-an-hour plane, which comes complete with stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed.

He has been seen regularly stepping out of the Bombardier Global Express, using it to travel to Thailand, Sardinia and the US.
