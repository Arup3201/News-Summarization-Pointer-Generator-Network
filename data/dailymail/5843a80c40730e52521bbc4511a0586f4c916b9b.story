The Queen and Camilla have not always shared the best of relationships.

Over the years, the love life of the monarch's eldest son has caused her no end of trouble.

Divorce, infidelity rumours, scorchingly embarrassing phone calls made public... It is no wonder it was said before Charles married Camilla in 2005 that the Queen had agreed only 'grudgingly' to the union.

But today, the Queen and her daughter-in-law looked to have buried any hatchet as they met up at the Windsor Horse Show. Indeed, they looked genuinely delighted to see each other.

The two embraced warmly when they encountered one another at the equestrian event today, with Camilla leaning in to proffer a kiss to the monarch.

Sealed with a kiss: Camilla greets the Queen with a peck as they meet at Windsor Horse Show today

No matter that this was an air kiss that
 barely grazed the Queen's hood, the smiling faces of both belied the 
affection that is seemingly growing between the two.

Camilla, dressed in a beige trench and carrying a tan snakeskin bag, even held the same sort of transparent birdcage umbrella the Queen has favoured for years.

Whether the monarch lent Camilla the brolly, handcrafted by East End London firm Fulton, or whether it was Camilla's own is unknown - although the black-trimmed umbrella is the same one that Camilla carried on for the rainy day of the Jubilee river pageant last summer.

The Horse Show, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year, was set up in 1943 to raise money for the war effort. Still going strong now, it is a chance for breeders the world over to gather and display their horses.

CAMILLA HAS USED HER FULTON UMBRELLA BEFORE...

BUT THE QUEEN DEFINITELY GOT THERE FIRST...
