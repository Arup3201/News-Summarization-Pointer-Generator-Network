Charged: Andrew Young, 48, was arrested on Sunday for his third instance of drunken driving

Disgraced politician John Edwards' former aide who was a key witness in the federal case against the Democrat has been arrested on drunken driving and child abuse charges.

Andrew Young, best known for falsely claiming to have a sexual relationship with Edwards' mistress during the 2008 presidential campaign, was arrested on Sunday night in North Carolina.

Court records show that Young was charged with impaired driving and misdemeanor child abuse since his 13-year-old son was in the vehicle.

The 48-year-old father was released on a $2,000 secured bond early Monday morning.

Young, who lives in Chapel Hill, was pulled over about 11.45pm near Walnut Creek Amphitheatre in Raleigh after he 'was involved in a road rage incident where he punched a vehicle,' according to court records.

The arresting officer described Young as having 'red glossy eyes, slurred speech.'

Young told police he drank four large beers at a concert, according to the report.

The outdoor arena had just hosted a show by country music singer Luke Bryan.

North Carolina court records show Young has been charged with driving while impaired on two prior occasions, most recently in 2006.

Young's arrest report does not list a current employer.

In 2007, the married aide falsely claimed paternity of the baby Edwards fathered with a campaign videographer, Rielle Hunter.

Young testified at Edwards' 2012 campaign finance trial that he took secret payments from two political donors to hide his boss' pregnant mistress from the media.

Edwards was acquitted on one felony count, and the jury was unable to agree on a verdict on five other charges. Federal prosecutors elected not to seek a retrial.

Young wrote a 2010 tell-all book about his role in the Edwards scandal, titled 'The Politician.'

Trying to keep it quiet: As a married aide to Edwards, Young (left, with his wife in 2010) publicly said that he was the father of videographer Rielle Hunter's daughter Frances Quinn (right, in 2012) and not Edwards

At the subsequent trial in federal court, however, Young was forced to admit under cross-examination that several details in his book- which has been optioned for a film being written by Aaron Sorkin- were inaccurate.

Edwards' defense lawyers claimed that the presidential candidate had no direct knowledge of the roughly $1million in payments funneled into accounts controlled by Young and his wife, Cheri. Bank records entered into evidence showed much of the money went not to care for Edwards' mistress, but to help build the couple's palatial dream home.
