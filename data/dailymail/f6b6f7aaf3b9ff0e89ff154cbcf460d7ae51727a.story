Second World War fighter planes swooped overhead as Prince Charles thanked the 'remarkable' Battle of Britain veterans who helped to win the war at their spiritual home today.

The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were visiting Bentley Priory in Harrow, north-west London, the headquarters of Fighter Command during the decisive air battle.

A Spitfire and a Hurricane flew low overhead as the Prince spoke to a crowd including 10 veterans of the air and eight women who assisted them from the ground, tracking enemy movements from what was known as the 'filter room'.

The Royal told them: 'Having just 
become a grandfather, one of the great things I remember when I was very
small is having stories told to me about the war.

'I wanted to know everything in those days as I was born in 1948.'

The
Prince explained that during his youth he had been lucky enough to meet
people who had risked their lives defending Britain as part of Fighter 
Command.

He added: 'I at 
least have some idea of the remarkable nature of such people like, of 
course, the wonderful lady veterans who are here today from the filter 
room.

'At the age of 18, 19, 20 they were ensuring that this country never gave up.'

Charles, who is patron of the Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust, opened a new £9.5m museum at the mansion house.

He
also unveiled a bust of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, Fighter 
Command's leader and creator of the strategy which saw Britain defeat 
Germany's planes, averting Hitler's planned invasion of the British 
Isles.

Veteran Patricia 
Clark, 92, posed for a picture with Charles and Camilla in the restored 
filter room, which boasts a statue of her with her colleagues tracing 
the movements of Nazi aircraft.

Mrs Clark, a grandmother of eight who lives in Marsh Green, Kent, said: 'We have never been recognised, this is the first time.

'We were a secret for 30 years after the war and weren't made public until 1975.

'Of course by that time everybody was utterly fed up of war stories and there wasn't much interest anymore.

'If anyone asked what you did during the war and you said 'I was in the filter room' and no one would know what you were taking about.'

Serving in the Women's RAF from 1940 to 1945, Mrs Clark rose to the role of supervisor working from the balcony of the filter room and went on to become a writer after the war.
