A grieving mother killed herself after the Samaritans refused to reveal details of her drowned son’s calls to its helpline, a coroner has said.

The inquest into the death of 18-year-old Matthew Williams heard how a ‘lack of co-operation’ from the charity may have contributed to his mother’s suicide.

While Matthew was missing, Susan Williams, 43, had discovered that the last phonecall made by his son was to the Samaritans’ helpline.

Tragedy: Matthew Williams, right, said today his wife Susan, centre, was driven to suicide after Samaritans refused to co-operate when their son Matthew, left, went missing, an inquest heard

Bereft: Dennis and Susan Williams pictured holding a picture of son Matthew. Mr Williams told his son's inquest his wife never recovered from her son's death having believed he was in a Samaritans safe house

The court heard how she begged the charity to tell her about his state of mind.

But the charity refused in accordance with its rules, saying the information was confidential. 

Struggle: Dennis Williams said Susan, left, 'went downhill' after Matthew was discovered dead and later committed suicide

Her
 husband Dennis told the hearing how she then resorted to making a call 
to the helpline herself, claiming to be suicidal, in a bid to gauge the 
response her son might have received.

When
 a Samaritans worker told her she could stay in a ‘safe house’, it gave 
the full-time mother false hope that this is what had happened to her 
missing son, Mr Williams suggested.

But
 a month later Matthew’s body was discovered by a fisherman at sea, 
close to the village of Malltraeth, in Anglesey. The court, sitting in 
Llangefni, was told that Matthew had suffered from mental illness in the
 past and was worried about his upcoming A-levels when he disappeared 
from the family home in Bangor on April 23, 2012.

Police
 mounted a huge search and discovered the straight-A student, who hoped 
to become a doctor, had made three calls to the Samaritans on the night 
he vanished, with the final call made close to the Menai Bridge.

Mr 
Williams, 55, said: ‘My wife believed he [Matthew] was still alive. She 
thought for weeks that he was in a safe house and didn’t want to be 
contacted.

‘After we buried him she went downhill. She loved him – he was her little boy.’ 

Mr
 Williams discovered the body of his wife of 16 years hanging at their 
home in August 2012.

She had also taken a ‘toxic’ dose of 
anti-depressants.

The couple have two other children.

Coroner Dewi 
Pritchard-Jones said: ‘I am sure the uncertainty relating to the death 
of [Mrs Williams’s] son and the absence of any information and no 
co-operation from the Samaritans may well have contributed to her 
death.’

Only when the 
coroner threatened to issue a summons for the head of the charity to 
give evidence did the Samaritans eventually agree to co-operate with the
 inquest.

In the end it was 
‘of no use’ to the inquiry, the coroner added. The organisation said 
Matthew’s call had been classed as ‘category one’, which is not 
considered to pose a risk to life.

The coroner said he could not say for certain whether the teenager intended to kill himself and recorded an open verdict.

Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of Samaritans, right, said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to the Williams family.

'It's important to remember that suicide is a complex issue and is seldom the result of a single factor but likely to have several inter-related causes.

'Samaritans has the utmost respect for our callers' privacy and we take this issue very seriously. This is an essential and greatly valued feature of the service we provide.

'We believe that without our promise to keep everything confidential, people who have the greatest need might never have the courage or trust to speak to us. This confidentiality has been in place since Samaritans was founded sixty years ago. Since then we've received more than 115 million calls which clearly demonstrate the trust that the wider community has in Samaritans and the importance of maintaining our confidentiality policy.

'In order to retain the integrity of our service this policy remains in place even if we never hear from our caller again.

'There are only four circumstances in which Samaritans will release information obtained during a call, in these circumstances we will fully co-operate by sharing the information held with the relevant authorities: If a caller directly asks us to pass on information to someone else; we receive a court order requiring us to share information; we receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings; the safety of our volunteers or the delivery of our service is threatened, for example by making it difficult for other people to get hold of us.'

Mr Pritchard-Jones said the inquest into Matthew’s death had been delayed because of the attitude of the charity.

Only when he threatened Samaritans’ chief executive, Catherine Johnstone, with a witness summons did they eventually agree to disclose information.

In the end it was ‘of no use’ to the inquiry, the coroner added. The organisation said Matthew’s call had been classed as ‘category one’, which is not considered to pose a risk to life.

Mr Pritchard-Jones said: ‘They (Samaritans) were concerned that they might be disclosing confidential information or conversations relating to the deceased person and his family.

'When I explained all I wanted was to try and find out what had happened to Matthew, to know his intentions, and to try to work out how he came to be in the sea, that led to a change of attitude.’

The coroner said he couldn’t say for certain whether the teenager intended to kill himself and recorded an open verdict.

Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, offered her ‘sincere condolences’ to the Williams family.

But she stressed that the charity took a callers’ privacy ‘very seriously’ and only disclosed information

if specifically requested to do so by the caller, in the event of a terrorist act or bomb warning, if required to do so by a court order or if the safety of their staff or service was under threat.

‘We believe that without our promise to keep everything confidential, people who have the greatest need might never have the courage or trust to speak to us,’ she said.

‘In order to retain the integrity of our service this policy remains in place even if we never hear from our caller again.’
