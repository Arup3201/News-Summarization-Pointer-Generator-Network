A council leader who subjected his wife to a decade of abuse shot her dead then  killed himself when he found out she was considering leaving him, an inquest heard.

Keith Johnson, 58, was described by 44-year-old Andrea as someone who would ‘change like the devil’ when they were alone.

Details of her years of torment at his hands only emerged in a secret diary discovered after her death.

Violent: A diary kept by Mrs Johnson and found by police after the couple had died, revealed that Mr Johnson subjected his wife to a decade of abuse

The couple, who had been together for more than 20 years, had an ‘open relationship’ and each had affairs. 

But
after learning she was considering ending their marriage Johnson, the 
Tory leader of North Norfolk District Council and former mayor of 
Cromer, wrote out wills and funeral instructions, before luring her to 
her death outside their home.

He was yesterday described as a ‘monster’ by her family. 

In
one diary entry, soon after they married in 2004, shop assistant Mrs 
Johnson wrote: ‘He doesn’t seem bothered he is hurting me, said I either
like it or lump it.’ 

Later she described how he would ‘change like the devil’ and in another entry said: ‘He’s done it so often it doesn’t matter.’

Investigation: Police guard the scene at Compit Hills in Cromer, Norfolk, where Mr Johnson killed his wife and then himself in December last year

Deliberate: The inquest heard that Mr Johnson planned to kill his wife with her own shotgun after luring her back to the house telling her that he would not be violent

The
inquest in Norwich heard yesterday how she had been in ‘a close 
relationship’ with cleaning  company director Robert Jeans, 62, in the 
months before her death.

Harrowing: Police only found Mrs Johnson's diary during a search of the house following her death

Johnson threw her out of their bungalow in Compit Hills, near Cromer, and she went to stay with Mr Jeans nearby. 

The next day Mr Jeans drove her back to her marital home after Johnson invited them for a chat and promised not to harm her. 

Mr
Jeans told the inquest how he did not get out of his car and drove 
away, leaving Mrs Johnson talking to her husband on their driveway.

Mrs
Johnson called 999 at 2.28pm to report that her husband was on the 
driveway with a shotgun and the operator heard a gunshot and her 
screams.

Several minutes later Johnson went into the back garden and shot himself with one of his wife’s four licensed shotguns.

Police
found a series of notes, including details of how to dispose of the 
estate and how the couple should be buried, suggesting he had planned 
the murder on  December 2 last year. 

Post mortems found Mrs Johnson died of a single shotgun wound to the chest and her husband from a shotgun wound to his neck. 

After
the inquest, a domestic violence homicide review was published 
detailing how Johnson abused his spouse, who he saw as a ‘trophy wife’.

It contained details of the diary which referred to the times when he 
beat her while drunk and had sex with other women in front of her at 
their home.

Mrs Johnson’s 
family told of their horror at the revelations.

Outside court, her 
sister Sharon Thorpe said: ‘We wish we had known you were suffering so 
we could have helped you. Keith Johnson, the face of Cromer, was nothing
more than a monster.’ 

Coroner William Armstrong concluded that Mrs Johnson suffered an unlawful death and Mr Johnson killed himself.

No one knows what happens behind closed doors and few care enough to ask. It is very hard to be married to a 'controller' and there is the added fear of what will happen if he loses control. I am surprised he 'allowed' his wife to have affairs. RIP Andrea, Rot in hell Keith
