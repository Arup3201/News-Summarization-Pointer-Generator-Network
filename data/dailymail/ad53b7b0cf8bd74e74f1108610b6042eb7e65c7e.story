The catwalk at the Rag & Bone show at New York Fashion Week this afternoon was in the shape of a giant silver X - and that emblem could not be more fitting, as designers Marcus Wainwright and David Neville have sartorial X-factor in spades.

The jam-packed venue was expecting a lot from this A-list-adored duo, who just continue to impress season after season - and their latest offering didn't disappoint.

The spring/summer 2014 collection promises to be yet another commercial hit, with its fresh palette of crisp whites set off by watercolor-like shots of turquoises and pinks.

Overall impressions: The dungaree-style jumpsuit (left) and flatforms continue to reference the Nineties, while fisherman-style pants (right) pay tribute to backpacker days in South East Asia

Light-as-air dresses and skirts in the sheerest of contrasting layers are made for sexy summer nights, while one black knee-length dress with a split at one side will be easy day-to-night favorite for the Downtown set.

The Bangkok pant, too, with its tie waist is a luxe take on fisherman trouser - a dose of nostalgia for those who may have adopted the louche 'backpacker chic' look while traveling the beaches of South East Asia as a student.

Accessorize all areas: Almost every look was completed by one of the design duo's new handbags

Anyone for cricket? The plunging V-neck sweater promises to be a favorite in store next spring

There was a sporty feel in the form of 
buttoned-up polo shirts and cricket jumpers with the deepest of V-necks,
and the Nineties influence that has been so 
strong over the past summer looks set to continue into next: it 
certainly lent a fun, youthful edge with crop tops, sharply-tailored 
overalls and flatform sandals.

Though it was a spring/summer collection,
there was still plenty of outerwear in the form of blush leather duster
coats and a coral blazer with a to-die-for cut-out back - it makes 
sense: these boys are from England where summer doesn't necessarily mean
warm weather.

But of course it will be the release of 
Rag & Bone's latest accessories that will set the cash registers on 
fire - round white sunglasses and easy-to-walk-in booties and sandals 
are instant cool for the wearer - even if they aren't a catwalk model.

The show offered a glimpse of the label's newest handbags - the first designs that we have seen outside of the Pilot range.

Slouchy satchels and compact totes will fit fashion editors' paraphernalia nicely - and the average woman's too.

A
star-studded front row comes as little surprise at Rag & Bone, and 
before the show, the attention was largely on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna
Wintour.

Family affair: David Neville (left) and Marcus Wainwright (right) take their bows after the show. They then walked part of the runway with their sons in hand

Also in attendance were actress Lake Bell and Jessica Seinfeld, who wore her hair in pretty braids.

But the real highlight of the show was seeing Mr Neville and Mr Wainwright appear on the runway at the end of their show - each joined by a young son proudly clutching their father's hand.

It was enough to melt the frostiest fashionista's heart. . . until the next show at least.
