Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic last night scored the ‘greatest goal ever’ to round off a crushing victory over England in the first match at his national stadium.

The talented footballer's remarkable overhead kick came when he was 30 yards from goal. He sprang six feet into the air to arch the ball over the helpless goalkeeper and into the net.

The world's biggest football names are already queuing up to praise the goal, with even England's gobsmacked stars hailing his achievement as 'extraordinary' and 'world class'.

VIDEO: Watch Zlatan Ibrahimovic's incredible fourth goal...

England captain Steven Gerrard, playing his 100th match for his country, said: 'It is the best goal I have seen live.

'The best goal I’d seen before that was Wayne Rooney’s against Manchester
City.

'Everyone knows how special that was, but this one — an overhead 
kick from 30 yards when the ball is six feet in the air — only certain 
players can do that. And he is a special player.

‘This was a world-class performance from a  world-class player.'

Ibrahamivic's
goal was his fourth of the match, taking the score to 4-2 to round off 
the first game at Friends Arena in Stockholm.

Pure delight: Sweden's captain celebrates his outrageous fourth goal of the friendly, with the world praising the sheer audacity of his remarkable propeller kick

@rioferdy5 What a goal Ibra Rio Ferdinand

@therealstevenpiNo words can describe that goal Steven Pienaar

@RobbieSavage8Oh dear! One of best goals I’ve ever seen Robbie Savage

@themichaelowenThat was obscene. What a goal Michael Owen

PS... Zlatan enjoyed it too...‘When I saw the keeper was out of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it comes off it’s fantastic.’

The propeller kick came after goalkeeper Joe Hart had come out of his area to head the ball clear.

Silence
fell as those inside the arena held their breath. and watched the 
flight of the ball. Then the noise exploded as it landed in the net.

Even England
supporters stood to applaud the audacity of Sweden's captain, thrilled 
to witness such a brilliant flash of sporting beauty.

Ibrahimovic ripped off his shirt, tossed it towards the crowd and shrugged as he was shown a yellow card.

Asked to rate his international career 
out of 10, Ibrahimovic replied: ‘Ten. When I saw the goalkeeper was out 
of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it 
comes off it’s fantastic.’

Former England manager Graham Taylor said: ‘That’s the greatest goal I’ve ever seen.’

England manager Roy Hodgson, who 
suffered his first defeat over 90 minutes, said: ‘Ibrahimovic’s fourth 
goal was extraordinary and it put the tin lid on the game. It was a 
fantastic goal.

'But it was the second and third goals which killed us.

'For 60-70 minutes we played very well and deserved to be leading. There 
are lots of reasons to be optimistic.’

Opener: Ibrahmovic fires Sweden into the lead after 20 minutes - but Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker put England ahead before half-time

Hat-trick hero: Ibrahimovic curls home a free kick to put Sweden in front again in the final 14 minutes, and his fourth goal was then the icing on the cake

Sweden's star man famously once said: 'Guardiola (then
Barcelona manager) drove me like a Fiat... I am a Ferrari.'

It was a typical comment from a man who, despite his
doubters, has never been short of confidence in his own ability.

And while Ibrahimovic's performances against English clubs in
Europe have often fallen short of his high standards (before last night he had
scored just four goals in 1,556 minutes against English clubs and England) his
wider statistics mark him out as one of the best players of his generation.

He is the only player to have scored for six different clubs
in the Champions League, and up until last season he had won eight consecutive
league titles (Ajax 03/04, Juventus 04/05, 05/06, Inter 06/07, 0708, 08/09, Barcelona
09/10 and AC Milan 10/11).

And a number of managers and chairmen have recognised his
talent - he has cost a combined total of £150m in transfer fees.

But missing from his CV is a Champions League victory and
honours at international level.

Until those blanks are filled - though playing for Sweden
makes the latter unlikely - doubts about his greatness may remain. But
certainly not in his own head.

Sweden substitute Tobias Sana said: 
‘It was Zlatan against children. He has been criticised in England and 
this proves them all wrong.’

The Sweden player became the first footballer to hit four in a match against England.

No-one had even scored a hat-trick against England since Marco van Basten in 1988.

The
two England goals came after Ibrahimovic opened the scoring in the 20th
minute, with Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker taking the national side 
to a half-time lead.

The 
excitement was abruptly cut off in the last 14 minutes, however, when 
Ibrahimovic scored three more and went down in history.

Overshadowed: England captain Steven Gerrard, appearing for the national side for the 100th time, jostles with Ibrahimovic on the pitch before praising the player's skill after the match

Historic moment: The Swedish press lauded Ibrahimovic as 'incredible' as the footballer covered the front pages

The debate as to whether Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goal was the
greatest ever will rage long and hard - but it is certainly up there with the
best.

But here are a few other spectacular overhead kicks that are
vying alongside it to be recognised as the best ever.

Rivaldo, Barcelona v Valencia, La Liga, June 17, 2001

Barcelona went into the last game of the season needing a
win to qualify for the Champions League. With two minutes to go, the score was
2-2, with Brazilian legend Rivaldo having scored both Barca's goals.

Then as the home side poured forward the ball was again
chipped into Rivaldo as he stood on the edge of the box with his back to goal.
Two touches later - one with the chest, one an acrobatic swing of the right
boot - and the ball had nestled into the bottom corner and Barca's place in the
following season's Champions League was assured.

Trevor Sinclair, QPR v Barnsley, FA Cup Fourth Round,
January 25, 1997

Ask any fan of QPR - and a large number of other supporters
- and they will tell you the greatest goal that will ever be scored came from
the right foot of Trevor Sinclair back in 1997.

The flying winger met a looping cross from the right a full
20 yards from goal with an acrobatic overhead kick that flew into the back of
the net

After the game Sinclair reported: 'I try them all the time
in training but they’ve never come off like that.'

It was such a good strike that it beat David Beckham’s goal
from the halfway line against Wimbledon to be crowned Match of the Day’s Goal
of the Season.

Wayne Rooney, Manchester United v Manchester City, Premier
League, February 12, 2011

Just 13 minutes were left with a disappointing Manchester
derby poised at 1-1. Nani swung in a cross that looped up off the back of a
City defender. Waiting underneath it was Rooney, who leapt up, arched his back and
executed the perfect scissor kick into the top corner.

'I think so,' said Rooney when asked if it was the best goal
of his career. 'I saw it come into the box and thought "why not?"

'Thankfully it finished up in the top corner. I was trying
to get in a good position for when Nani crossed it. Nine time out of 10 they go
over the crossbar. Today it ended up in the top corner.’

Pele, Allied PoWs v Germany, Paris (from the film Escape to Victory)

The Allies went 4-0 down in the first half before pulling a goal back on the stroke of half time. Pele, who the Germans had succeeded in kicking off the park, roused himself for the treatment table to help the team's cause.

And it was the Brazlian superstar who completed one of the greatest sporting comebacks in cinematic history.

With the score clawed back to 4-3 and the clock ticking down Pele sprayed the ball wide to Booby Moore who took it down on his chest before standing up a cross into the box.

Pele, holding his damaged arm to his chest, leapt into the air swung up his right boot and made it 4-4. Cue celebrations and a sneaky escape thanks to the Parisian crowd. Fantasy football.
