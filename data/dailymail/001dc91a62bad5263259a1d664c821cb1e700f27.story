Clark Atlanta University says the killing of a junior chemistry major from Central Florida is a 'devastating' loss for the school.

Police in suburban Atlanta say three people have been arrested in the death of 21-year-old James Jones Jr., a Daytona Beach native.

He was looking to buy an iPhone from a seller on Craigslist.

Marietta Police spokesman David Baldwin says Jones was robbed and fatally shot Monday night after responding to an ad for an iPhone 6.

Baldwin says 18-year-old Jordan Baker, 19-year-old Jonathon Myles and 21-year-old Kaylnn Ruthenberg are jailed on felony murder, aggravated assault and armed robbery charges.

Clark Atlanta said in an email to students that it's reaching out to family and friends of Jones before finalizing any memorial tributes.

'This is a devastating loss for the Clark Atlanta University family,'' a statement read. 'Mr. Jones was a serious scholar and a kind, engaging spirit whose work and comportment spoke well of the university's core values and those instilled long ago by those contributing to his upbringing. In addition to his studies, he was a UPS scholar at Fickett Elementary School and a science mentor for the HBCU Rising Cares Mentoring program at Brown Middle School. He also was an amateur athlete.'

'It was an illegitimate ad he was responding to and he did not know the sellers,' Marietta Police officer David Baldwin told ABC News. 'The ad was posted in the hopes to lure somebody in, but obviously the victim didn't know that.'

Jones had been shot while still in his car.

Jordan Baker, 18, also allegedly acted in the plot to murder Jones with the lure of an iPhone

After he was killed, the car rolled forward into another car and a tree.

Police were dispatched to respond to a motor vehicle accident. 

'Through the course of the investigation, they discovered that he was going to that area in response to a Craigslist ad,' Baldwin said.

Craiglist has yet to respond to reporters questions.

'It was a heck of an undertaking and investigation but it helps to bring closure to the family. We hope to give them peace to know that everyone involved in this senseless murder will be held accountable, Baldwin said.
