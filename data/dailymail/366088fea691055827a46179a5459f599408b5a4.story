A philandering music teacher who murdered his fiancée following a string of affairs was also cheating with a 15-year-old pupil.

Andrew Lindo, 29, had ‘sexual activity’ with the impressionable girl who was one of his music students and fell victim to his ‘charms’.

The underage sex was revealed after Lindo was found guilty of murdering Marie Stewart, the mother of his two children, and then hiding her body in a flight bag in the couple’s garage.

As well as the relationship with the young girl, to whom he sent an 
indecent photo, he was also leading a complex ‘double life’ with two 
fiancées and other lovers.

The jury, who reached their verdict in only 55 minutes, had not been 
told the full depravity of the sex-obsessed teacher during the 
three-week trial.

Hours after the murder he texted the underage girl while his other fiancée Angela Rylance was waiting for him in his bed.

There were emotional scenes at Bradford Crown Court as the parents and 
sister of the dead woman cried and hugged each other after the verdict 
was announced. He was never charged with underage sex because it only 
emerged after he had been arrested for murder.

Lindo showed no emotion when the verdict was announced. He is due to be given a mandatory life sentence today.

He admitted unlawfully killing his fiancée, but claimed he ‘lost 
control’ because he believed she was mistreating his daughter and said 
he was not a murderer.

But the court heard how Lindo cheated on Miss Stewart, 30, with several 
women who believed his web of lies and thought he was a single parent 
living alone.

Miss Rylance, 29, suspected he was lying about his personal life and he 
went through with the terrible crime to convince her he was telling the 
truth.

On the day Miss Rylance was due to sleep the night for the first time at
 his house in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, he disposed of his fiancée with
 appalling violence, the court heard.

Lindo throttled her, then bashed her over the head with a Winnie the 
Pooh child’s chair before stabbing her 12 times and putting her body in 
the flight bag.

After cleaning the scene he woke the children and drove to pick up Miss Rylance as arranged.

For seven weeks Lindo convinced Miss Stewart’s family and friends she 
was still alive, setting up an elaborate smokescreen using Facebook and 
texts from her mobile phone to tell everyone she had left him and moved 
abroad.

He believed he could lie his way out of trouble yet again. This time he failed.

When friends and family became suspicious, the police were called.

They searched the house and found the decomposing body on February 13.

In pursuit of sexual gratification Lindo had no scruples and he left a 
trail of broken hearts in his wake. It is not known how many women he 
deceived, but there are thought to be others who did not feature in his 
trial.

Lindo betrayed anyone’s trust without a pang of guilt. An extrovert with
 a boyish smile and natural charm, Lindo discovered how to impress the 
opposite sex at university and became an outrageous womaniser.

As well as teaching music to children, Lindo was a singer and bass 
player in the band Battered Soul and knew how to ‘perform’. He pretended
 to be a devoted single parent to gain the sympathy of his would-be 
conquests.

The son of a property developer and financial adviser, Lindo was brought
 up on Teesside and devoted his energies to two interests – music and 
women.

It all started at Huddersfield University where Lindo studied music and was good friends with Martin Waldron.

Waldron married Marie Stewart, a fellow undergraduate studying health 
and community studies, in 2005. But the marriage didn’t last long 
because she fell in love with Lindo and by 2007 they were living 
together and she was pregnant.

She and Lindo became devoted parents of a little girl and in January 
2010 they had a son. One friend remarked that they seemed ‘almost the 
perfect family’.

But on Lindo’s part the domestic bliss was a charade. While his partner 
was pregnant with their second child he was simultaneously cheating with
 two women colleagues at the Take 2 stage school in Barnsley where he 
worked.

He cleverly stopped Alison Doram, 27, and Amy Wilde, 26, finding out 
they were seeing him at the same time by telling them both that the 
other fancied him and was jealous.

Miss Doram, a dance teacher, had a five-month sexual relationship with 
Lindo, believing Miss Stewart had walked out on him and the children. 
‘Andrew was really friendly and easy to talk to, a charmer,’ she said. 
‘I believed I was in a relationship with him exclusively.’

Even when she saw Miss Stewart’s Facebook page indicating she was living
 with Lindo, he convinced her it was a ‘tactic’ in their custody dispute
 over their daughter.

But she ended their relationship after reading on Facebook that Miss 
Stewart’s status had been changed to ‘engaged to Andrew’ on Valentine’s 
Day last year.

Confused and emotional, she spoke to Miss Wilde and discovered she had 
also dated Lindo the previous October. That relationship amounted to 
going out on dates and ‘kissing and cuddling’.

Far more shocking was Lindo’s relationship with one of his best pupils 
at another school where he taught music. The girl of 15, who has since 
passed more than 12 GCSEs, was lured into the illicit relationship, 
which Lindo denied after his arrest.

Miss Rylance, a mother-of-two who had separated from her partner, fell 
for Lindo when he walked into the shop where she worked. She believed he
 was a single parent and they began a passionate affair.

Eventually she became suspicious he was lying about Miss Stewart and 
told him she wouldn’t be convinced until she spent a night in his house.

They agreed to have the sleepover on December 18 last year – the day of 
the murder. He even took time during the brutal assault to text Miss 
Rylance that he would be late picking her up.

She was there on Christmas Day and saw the New Year in with the man with
 whom she planned to spend her future and they were soon looking for a 
house to share.

But before long Lindo was arrested and Miss Rylance discovered she had 
been the latest innocent young woman to be taken in by an evil cheat.
