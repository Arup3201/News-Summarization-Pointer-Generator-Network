A grieving designer has created a weighted blanket that simulates the feeling of being hugged by a loved one.

After her fiance's father passed away last summer, Mia Cinelli from Ohio designed The Weight, a 6lb poly-pellet stuffed fleece equipped with arms and hands made to help with the grieving process. 

'I carried my grief around with me; my heart was heavy for months,' she explained on her website. 'I wanted to feel his presence, so I made a hand to hold. I welcomed this weight, this semblance of company.'

Painful process: Ohio-based designer Mia Cinelli created the weighted blanket that 'hugs' its users after her fiance's father died last summer 

Miss Cinelli, who is an assistant professor of Art & Design at Defiance College, made multiple prototypes before she started researching the psychological benefits of weighted blankets.

They are traditionally used in occupational therapy to help comfort those experiencing the stress and anxiety associated with ADD/ADHD, sensory disorders and autism.

Miss Cinelli expanded on the concept by adding arms and hands for the user to wrap around themselves and hold.

'In moments of feeling the anxiety that accompanies grief, the weight provides a proprioceptive deep pressure, creating a feeling of presence and calm,' she wrote on her website. 'Its use imitates an intimate gesture, reminiscent of a hug from behind.'

She continued: 'When I feel relaxed and take the weight off, I feel lighter - both physically and in spirit.' 

Cuddle buddy: The Weight can also simulate the feeling of being held while the user is laying down 

Holding on: After researching the use of weighted blankets in occupational therapy, Miss Cinelli added hands to her design, enabling users to entwine their fingers with the product

Miss Cinelli is currently exploring the future of her handmade prototype. 

'I needed to make it for me first, and now I need to figure out who to make it for next,' she told Dezeen.  

She continued: 'Is it a custom-made cultural object kept by grieving loved ones? Does it become standard equipment of funeral home directors? Is it an elite object of comfort intertwined with high fashion, or is it sold next to heating pads in pharmacies?'

Although she has found comfort in her product, Miss Cinelli said she is aware that others may find the design unsettling. 

'I have seen it tagged as #creepy online, and the hands are a bit odd,' she said. 'When I finished it, I couldn't tell if it was too weird or just right, but I think all of my best work falls into that area.'

Multiple hugs: Miss Cinelli's product can be draped over the user's body in a variety of ways 

Intimate gesture: When wrapped over the user's shoulders, The Weight is reminiscent of a hug from behind
