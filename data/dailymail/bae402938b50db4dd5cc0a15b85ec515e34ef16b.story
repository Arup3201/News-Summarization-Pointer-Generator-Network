Michael Sam, the first openly gay football player to be drafted into the NFL received a warm welcome as he arrived in St Louis, Missouri on Monday to start training with the Rams.

The draft turned Sam into an instant celebrity across the U.S. and especially within the LGBT community.

At his first Rams press conference on Tuesday, Sam reacted to hearing a story about a son who was able to finally come out to his father after being inspired by the football player's story.

'I'm honored that I helped someone be comfortable with who they are, gave him a little courage to deal with his father. I'm honored to have that happen to his son,' Sam said.

'I guess it's great': Michael Sam spoke about being the first openly-gay man drafted into the NFL at his first press conference with the St Louis Rams on Tuesday

'But right now I'm just looking 
forward to continuing on my dream. If it inspires other people, hey, I'm
 with you. Anyone that's not OK with that, if someone disowns you, be a 
part of my family. I welcome you. Ram up!'

Sam, a graduated of the University of Missouri, was selected in the seventh round of the draft and celebrated on live TV by kissing his boyfriend Vito Cammisano.

A father posted the heartwarming tale of his son's coming out on the university's Facebook page after. The man says he was watching the draft with his son and other family members, who are mostly military veterans.

'When Michael Sam was finally drafted my 15 year old son started crying and told me he was gay. He said he didn't want to hide anymore or be embarrassed about who he was. Thank you Mizzou for embracing Mr. Sam and recruiting a young man of his caliber so that kids like my son have more positive role models to look to...'

At the press conference on Tuesday, Sam said he was thankful to have been drafted, especially just to a team located just two hours from his alma mater.

'St Louis feels just like home,' he said. 'I still [don't] really feel like I’m part of the NFL right now. I'm 
blessed.'

When asked what it felt like to be the first gay man hired in the NFL, Sam said: 'I guess it's great.'

He apperaed with five other late-round draft picks for the press conference on Tuesday.

After about 20 minutes, the other players left and Sam answered questions solo.

He says he hopes his landmark drafting will let other people know 'It's OK to be who you are.'

'Whether you're gay, straight, black or white. It's OK to be comfortable in your own skin,' he said.

Sam has a long road ahead of him if he wants to make the Rams' 53-man roster by football season.

The Rams are already pretty well-stacked for the position he used to play at Missouri, so he'll have to focus on learning another role.

But he believes the attention he's received is only going to help him play better.

'Thank God for you guys making this all a big deal, because it’s just going to make me a better player than I am now,' Sam said.

'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added.

There were fears that Sam would be the target of homophobia if drafted, and Miami Dophins player Don Jones was even fined for tweeting 'HORRIBLE' after Sam was selected. But the Rams have so far been a tolerant team for Sam.

'They came to me, actually,' he said. '"Welcome to the family, let’s get to work," and that’s what we’re going to do.'

And if he is targeted for his sexual orientation, Sam says he'll focus his energies on the game.

'I have every confidence in myself that I will make this team,' Sam said. 'So when I do make it and when I put my pads on, if someone wants to say something, then you'll see No. 96 running down the field and making big plays for this team.'

But the conference took a dark turn when one of the reporters asked if he had spoken to his father, who told the New York Times that he would be opposed to his grandchildren being raised by gay parents.

'I have not had a one-on-one conversation with my father,' Sam answered bluntly. He did not elaborate.

Sam arrived in St Louis on Monday after spending the weekend in Las Vegas celebrating the draft with his boyfriend.

At the Las Vegas airport, Sam was greeted with applause as he boarded his flight for St Louis.

'He had a nice big round of applause from everybody.  They were congratulating him and welcoming him to St. Louis.  It was really impressive to see,' passenger Jason Hall told KTVI.

According to ESPN's Darren Rovell, a Michael Sam Rams jersey went on sale just three hours after he was drafted. CBSChicago subsequently reported that an 'avalanche' of the jerseys were immediately ordered and had suppliers 'scrambling.'

'He’s
 a good football player,’ Rams coach Jeff Fisher told NFL Network just 
after the pick was announced. ‘We got a good football player… I’m 
excited about the possibility of adding him to our defensive front.

'I’m excited to get him on the practice field and get him going.'
