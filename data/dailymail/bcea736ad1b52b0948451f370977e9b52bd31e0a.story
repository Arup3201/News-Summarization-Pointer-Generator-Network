Mick Jagger’s age could help him win him an £8 million insurance payout over the death of L’Wren Scott, a legal expert has claimed.

The Rolling Stones singer, 71, is not as spritely as he was and could have become overcome with grief more easily after discovering his girlfriend killed herself.

Contracts expert Zev Eigen said that the bar that would stop Jagger performing would be ‘much lower’ than if he were a younger man.

L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand, but their insurers are battling with the band to not pay out for losses. But Jagger's age may affect the case

He described Mr Jagger’s age as an ‘interesting wrinkle’ in the case that could hand him victory.

The Stones are locked in a bitter legal battle with the 12 underwriting companies who say Scott’s death is not covered by their policy because she took her own life.

Lawsuits have been filed at the High Court in London and in New York and Utah and Miss Scott’s entire medical history could be made public if the cases go to trial.

The papers also revealed for the first time that Mr Jagger was diagnosed with acute traumatic stress disorder, an extreme mental reaction, when told Miss Scott, hanged herself on March 17.

The Stones say he was told by his doctor not to perform for at least 30 days whilst he dealt with the condition, which can cause nightmares and flashbacks, meaning they had to put off shows in Australia and New Zealand. 

Mr Eigen, a visiting professor at NYC Law School, told the New York Daily News: ‘The insurance contract is for his performance, not hers.

Jagger was 'diagnosed as suffering from acute traumatic stress disorder' after Scott's death

‘And given his advanced age, there's a greater range of things that reasonably could affect his stamina, stress-level and ability to perform. The bar is much lower than it would be for a 21-year-old.

‘This contract was about his ability to get on stage and perform demanding physical feats.

‘Sure he's spry and awesome for a 71-year-old, but there's simply a greater range of things that could prevent someone his age from performing’.

An autopsy confirmed Miss Scott’s death was ruled a suicide after she was found in her luxury Manhattan apartment.

The designer’s fashion business was £4.6 million into debt and there was speculation she and Mr Jagger had broken up, though his spokesman denied this.

The Stones’ insurance policy was for up to £15 million and the tour was expected to make £28 million.

A clause says that if they extended it by another 14 shows to include Europe, which they did, then the total revenue would rise to £61 million.

In the High Court papers, however the insurers argue that because Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ they should not pay up.

They suggest that she could have been suffering from a mental condition beforehand that played a part in her actions.

Professor Elgin told the New York Daily News that he thought the Stones would settle as the band would be ‘loath’ to hand over more personal information to the insurers’ lawyers.

Lawyers for the insurers, who are based in London, did not return calls for comment. Nobody for the Stones was available for comment.

The disclosure is the most revealing insight yet into Jagger’s feelings.

He has so far given only one brief interview about Miss Scott’s suicide. In a statement, he said he would ‘never forget her’, adding: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.’ 

The eight insurers are led by Cathedral Capital and Talbot 2002 Underwriting Capital Limited, both based in London.

They responded by claiming that Miss Scott’s death was not ‘sudden and unforeseen’ or ‘beyond her control’ and so did not qualify for a payout.

They also claimed it was ‘reasonable to infer Miss Scott had been suffering from a mental illness’ that was ‘traceable to, or accelerated by, a condition for which she had received or been recommended medical attention’.

A pre-existing condition of this kind could affect any payout.

The insurers appeared to dispute the idea that Jagger was so deeply upset, and claimed that the doctor who diagnosed him had not actually carried out an examination.

They wrote: ‘It does not appear that Sir Mick Jagger was assessed at any time by a qualified psychiatrist or anyone else suitably qualified with sufficient expertise to make a diagnosis of acute stress disorder.’

Court documents revealed that Jagger has 18 people on his insurance policy, including Ms Scott, Jerry Hall, seven children and four grandchildren

The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after  L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life

The only proof they had seen was a letter from a doctor, who was not a psychiatrist and did not actually see the patient, the papers state. 

Last month, the insurers filed a lawsuit in New York’s Federal Court, and subpoenaed Adam Glassman, the executor of Scott’s will, the New York City medical examiner, and Brittany Penebre, her British assistant, in an attempt to gain access to any emails or messages about an ‘actual or alleged attempt at self harm by Miss Scott’ as well as her general mental health, or an ‘actual or alleged suicide attempt’.

Meanwhile in Utah, where Miss Scott grew up, a judge has ruled that the insurers will be allowed to seek documents and testimony from Miss Scott’s brother, Randall Bambrough, to find out more about her mental state.

However, Mr Bambrough told a local newspaper that he had yet to receive a summons.

Miss Scott, a fashion designer and model, was 49 when her body was found in her Manhattan apartment by Miss Penebre. An autopsy confirmed her death was suicide.

Her fashion business had been £4.6million in debt and she had abruptly cancelled her show at London Fashion Week, supposedly due to technical difficulties.

There were also reports she and Jagger had split up, leaving her ‘devastated’, although Jagger’s spokesman denied this. Documents filed at the district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, reveal Miss Scott was on a long list of family on the Stones’ insurance policy.

Also on Jagger’s list were his ex-wives Jerry Hall and Bianca Jagger, former girlfriends, seven children and four grandchildren.

The documents give a fascinating insight into how the insurance policy worked. The revenue for the tour was expected to be £28million, and this could have gone up if 15 extra European dates were added. The insurers agreed to pay out up to 50 per cent in case of tragedy.

A spokesman for the Rolling Stones declined to comment.

Lawyers for the insurers did not return calls for comment.

Hell-raisers: Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards

The Rolling Stones may still be going strong, but their court documents reveal that their disgruntled insurers are well aware of the toll taken by years of the rockstar lifestyle.

Hidden among the fine print of their tour insurance policy is a long list of exceptions – health issues for which each member of the ageing band is not covered.

For example, and perhaps not surprisingly, the insurers say they will not pay out if anything happens to guitarist Keith Richards related to ‘alcohol abuse, liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis’.

More unusually, anything to do with the injury that he suffered in 2006, when he was hit on the head by a coconut, will not be covered either.

For Ronnie Wood, anything to do with ‘alcohol abuse’ is also not covered. The exemptions for drummer Charlie Watts include any conditions related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2004 or his sciatica.

The documents show the band expected to receive £28million for their tour. Just three shows in Japan were worth £9million.
