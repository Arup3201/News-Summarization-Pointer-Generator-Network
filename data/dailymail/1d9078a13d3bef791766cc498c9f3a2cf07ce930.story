Eiropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has faced growing questions about his involvement in tax policy when prime minister of Luxembourg

Senior Conservatives have called for European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to be investigated over claims he encouraged tax avoidance.

Cabinet ministers said Mr Juncker, who denies wrongdoing, should be scrutinised over allegations that he encouraged companies to avoid tax while he was finance minister and prime minister of Luxembourg.

And the Labour party warned that if more evidence emerged against Mr Juncker 'serious questions' will be asked about him continuing in his powerful Brussels role.

Mr Juncker has admitted that as prime minister he was 'politically responsible' for what happened in each and every corner of the country', but suggested he did not know the tax deals were being negotiated.

Companies such as Burberry and Dyson had their divisions in Luxembourg lend money to their operations in other countries.

The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the Grand Duchy.

Some Tory backbenchers have already called for Mr Juncker to resign.

But in a major escalation of pressure on the burecrat, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps have backed the need for an investigation into the issue.

Mr Duncan Smith said he did not know if the matters were true or false but said the European Commission needed to show it had 'no fear of investigating their own'.

He did not name or criticise Mr Juncker directly when asked about the issue on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics.

But he said: 'This is a real moment for the European Union, for the commission, to show that it has the capacity and the determination to investigate its own and so if there is an issue, if there is some serious issue about a conflict and at one time one thing is being said and at another thing is being done, then these things need to be investigated and made public.

'And as soon as they're made public decisions have to be taken.

'The trouble for the European Union historically has been that it circles the wagons around the people that are having the finger pointed at them and refuses to let any kind of change takes place.'

Questioned if he expected Mr Juncker to be thoroughly investigated by the commission, Mr Duncan Smith replied: 'I think what is required from the European Commission is complete transparency.'

When pressed if this meant Mr Juncker's case, the Cabinet minister replied: 'Yes. I would say the same by the way if it were Britain.

'You need to make sure when you're saying one thing and doing one thing that you don't then say and do another at the same time, so there has to be an absolute clear purpose and at the same time a determination of the European Commission to make sure this whole issue is not brushed under the carpet but is transparent, open and investigated and then decisions can be taken one way or another.'

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Tory party chairman Grants Shapps have said it is right for Mr Juncker to be investigated

Mr Shapps, the Tory party chairman, said it was important that those in senior roles in Europe are held to account. He  told the same programme: 'I haven't seen all this evidence.

'I think it is absolutely right that it is properly investigated and that is what I hope will happen next.

'But either way the important thing is to hold Europe to account and to do that you've got to have a credible in-out referendum so you can have these negotiations about all of this stuff.'

Last week it emerged that speeches Mr Juncker made while prime minister of Luxembourg including an announcement to parliament that AOL and Amazon were planning to move their European headquarters to the country thanks to favourable corporate tax conditions his government had created.

Labour's shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden also warned Mr Juncker's role could be put into doubt.

Asked if Mr Juncker should resign or stand aside while the claims are examined, shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I think there's little chance of that but I think if more comes out on this then really serious questions will have to be asked about his position.'

Despite being Luxembourg's prime minister for 18 years - 15 of which were also spent as finance minister - Mr Juncker last week denied being involved in shaping the tax rulings that critics say enable corporations to slash their tax bills by shifting their European operations to the country.

'There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe,' he said during a press conference, adding that he was 'not the architect of what you could call the Luxembourgish problem'.

Instead he said it was up to the current Luxembourg government to explain the situation..
