Liverpool have been handed a boost after Daniel Sturridge returned to light training at Melwood as he continues his recovery from a thigh injury.

The England striker had been expected to miss three weeks after suffering the injury while away on international duty but it seems his comeback could come sooner than expected.

Sturridge looked comfortable jogging, turning and running with the ball as he trained alone on Wednesday morning.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was furious that Sturridge had not been given enough time to recover after he played 89 minutes in England's 1-0 friendly win over Norway

But manager Brendan Rodgers will be wary of throwing Sturridge back in too soon and he is likely to sit out this Saturday's visit to West Ham in the Barclays Premier League.

Next Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough at Anfield could see him return if his recovery continues ahead of schedule.

The rest of the Liverpool squad were given the day off following their late 2-1 win over Ludogorets Razgrad in the Champions League on Tuesday night.

Brendan Rodgers must decide when to reintroduce Sturridge to the team

Sturridge's injury setback caused friction between Rodgers and the England coaches, with the Liverpool manager outspoken in his belief that his recovery after playing 89 minutes in the friendly win over Norway should have been better managed.

Rodgers was furious his star wasn't given more rest and unsurprised when he limped out of a training session two days later, ruling him out of the Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland.

'We're disappointed because we feel it's an injury which could have been prevented,' Rodgers told talkSPORT.

'Clubs work differently to international teams. It's the recovery strategy. When we look at our players here, we look at them individually, in terms of what their needs are.'
