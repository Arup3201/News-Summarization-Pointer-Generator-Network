Tottenham Hotspur are looking to get back to winning ways in the Europa League against Partizan Belgrade following a loss and a draw in the Premier League.

And Spurs may not be finding their top form on the pitch right now but Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen looked relaxed and confident on the flight out to the Serbian capital.

Eriksen posted a selfie on Instagram of himself with the Belgian defender as they travelled out to Belgrade on Wednesday ahead of the match the following evening.

England midfielder Andros Townsend and Dutch goalkeeper Michel Vorm were also snapped smiling while waiting to board the flight.

Mauricio Pochettino's men drew 2-2 at the Stadium of Light last weekend and were humbled 3-0 at Liverpool in their previous Premier League match.

They will be hoping to get the Europa League group stage off to the perfect start by coming away from FK Partizan Stadium with a victory.
