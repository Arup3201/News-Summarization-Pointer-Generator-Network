A coroner has issued a warning about the dangers of the sea after a woman died as she had a paddle in the English Channel in rough conditions on Christmas Day in 2012.

Alan Craze, the East Sussex coroner, hoped the death of Frances McKeown, 51, would act as a 'salutary reminder' that the sea needs to be treated with 'respect'.

He spoke after hearing how Ms McKeown was swept to her death amid force nine winds and waves of more than 6ft high off the coast of St Leonards.

Tragic: Frances McKeown drowned while paddling in the sea close to Hastings on Christmas Day

The inquest, at Hastings Magistrates' Court, heard she had joined an informal gathering of people for a paddle on Christmas Day morning after reading about it on Facebook.

Ms McKeown, a community development worker, lined up with up to 11 people on the beach before aÂ  countdown was shouted out.

As some who ran in turned round to come back up the shoreline, Ms McKeown stumbled and was pulled back into the surf, the inquest heard.

Her partner of 15 years, John North, had been filming her but soon noticed her in difficulty.

He said in a statement: 'I was calling her name and could still see her being taken by the waves and off where there was a groyne.'

A buoyancy aid was fetched to try to reach Ms McKeown as she was being swamped by the waves, but it could not be flung far enough.

Mr North said: 'I want to be clear that Fran didn't have any intention to swim that day. She just wanted to get her feet wet.

'She had some health problems that she was managing. This dip was her way of taking advantage of the mobility that she had.'

Describing
 her as a socialable person who loved life and cherished those close to 
her, Poole-born Ms McKeown was looking forward to a holiday to Kenya at 
the time.

Witness Jim McSweeney, a teacher, told the inquest: 'She seemed to be getting further and further out, and was still waving.

'The
 waves were just huge. Then a few minutes later an enormous wave hit her
 on the head, and when she came up she was face down and floated towards
 the pier.'

Another swimmer,
 Dean Skelton, said: 'That day has taught me a lot about the sea. I have
 never experienced anything like that before.'

He added: 'I feel it was the swell and the strength of the under-current that no-one could see.'

Mr Skelton said that six or seven people had entered the sea for about 35 seconds, and he had to be pulled out.

Bartholemew
 Long said he instantly realised his error in entering the sea as he 
waded in, describing how he became 'completely stuck' in the tide.

Hastings
 RNLI lifeboat coxswain, Steven Warne, said: 'We know that for anyone in
 the water, it would have been very difficult to get out.'

Firefighters
 spotted Ms McKeown's body about 20 metres out at sea but they were 
ordered not to enter because of the choppy conditions.

Maxwell
 Gilbert, of East Sussex Fire and Rescue, said her body was tracked 
eastwards for about 100m before she was recovered as she came close to 
the shoreline.

As chest 
compressions were administered, cuts and bruises were noticed on her 
forehead. She was taken by ambulance to the Conquest Hospital where she 
was declared dead.

Pathologist
 Dr Ian Hawley carried out a post-mortem examination on January 2 and 
gave her cause of death as 'hypoxic brain injury due to drowning'.

Recording
 a verdict of misadventure, Mr Craze said it was her decision to enter 
the sea, but issued a note of caution about its dangers.

He
 said: 'We can't bring her back but I hope that anything that appears in
 the media is a salutary reminder that the sea has got to be treated 
with respect.

'Even when you think it's safe, there are things under the visible water that are dangerous.'
