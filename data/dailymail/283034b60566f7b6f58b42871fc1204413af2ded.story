Slaven Bilic never won against Arsene Wenger as a player. His record of one draw and two defeats at West Ham and Everton included a 4-0 beating at Highbury in 1998 that secured the Frenchman’s first Premier League title.

‘One of the worst matches of my career,’ he says with a grimace. ‘Howard Kendall put me in midfield, it was only the second time I’d played there and Petit and Vieira were on to me every time, “Bam!”

‘After six minutes Tony Adams cuffed me on the back of my neck and I scored an own goal. 1-0. We never had a chance after that.’

In demand: Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic says he has been offered seven management jobs in England

Bad memories: Bilic scored an own goal against Arsenal as a player that handed the Gunners the titl

On Tuesday night, 76,000 partisan Besiktas fans will be screaming for their manager to gain his revenge in Istanbul’s Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where Liverpool memorably won the Champions League in 2005.

A lucrative Champions League spot is up for grabs and Bilic, now sporting a rugged beard, is up for the fight.

‘Arsenal were the last team we wanted,’ he says. ‘I’ve watched Wenger’s teams for nearly 20 years and they are always quick, lively and play football.

‘But it’s not my philosophy to think we have nothing to lose because they are the favourites. **** that. It’s an alibi. I am also under pressure as manager of a massive club.

‘They say Besiktas have 15 million fans in Turkey, and they expect. Our fans stop and tell me: “Arsenal finished”. I worship the pressure. We are as close to them to qualifying for the Champions League.’

Fighting talk: The Croatian is confident his Besiktas team can cause an upset in Istanbul on Tuesday night

Bilic has experience at overturning the odds. He famously led his Croatia team to a 3-2 win at rainy Wembley in 2007, a result that cost England a place at Euro 2008 and brolly-clutching England manager Steve McClaren his job.

‘England were favourites that night, they needed the result and had 80,000 fans at home.

‘But we know underdogs can win in football. If we beat Arsenal, it wouldn’t be a miracle that would get shown on CNN,’ he says. 

Wally with a brolly: Bilic was responsible for stopping England from getting to Euro 2008

The last few years have seen Bilic enjoy both success and a hard-luck story or two.

He was seconds away from the semi-final of Euro 2008 until a late Turkey equaliser. 

He qualified for Euro 2012 but drew Italy and Spain in the group stage. His first club job with Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia ended in the sack.

His reputation in England has always remained high. Asked directly if he has ever been approached to manage here, he replies quietly: ‘Seven times.’ 

He will not name the clubs but is regularly linked with a return to West Ham, where he was a popular player and forged friendships with Harry Redknapp and Rio Ferdinand that still exist today.

There is no doubt he is a confirmed Anglophile. ‘I am really connected to England, I lived a very important part of my life there and I feel they like me there,’ he says.

‘I love the English attitude to football. We played a pre-season friendly this summer against Hereford United and they showed an unbelievable spirit.’

He added: ‘If you asked me which country I’d want to work in next, there is a big gap between England and the rest of the countries. But that is for the future, not now. Istanbul suits me as a city. I love it.’

Victory against Arsenal would propel the 45-year-old Bilic back among the A-list of wanted managers. He has identified Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey as his major obstacles.

‘Arsenal were good last year but I never felt they were going to win the title because something was missing: the top quality, the leaders.

‘But when I heard during the World Cup they were signing Alexis Sanchez, I thought “perfect for Arsenal”.’

He added: ‘Mentally, Arsenal should be ready to challenge for the title after winning the FA Cup but for me the likes of Chelsea are still first. They can play football or fight, Chelsea can do whatever. They can park the bus, or can force the other team to park the bus.’

Danger man: The Besiktas coach says Sanchez is exactly the kind of player that can thrive at Arsenal

Ramsey fan: Bilic thinks Aaron Ramsey, centre, is Arsenal's best and most important player

He is a huge fan of Ramsey. ‘He is Arsenal’s best player. Their most important player.

There is a lot more fuss on a daily basis about Jack Wilshere but so far on the pitch, it’s Ramsey,’ he said. ‘Most top players have one quality that stands out. You can’t tell with Ramsey, he is not that quick, he is not Scholes for his football brain, or Roy Keane for his fight. But he is nine out of 10 in everything.

‘But overall I’d say the Arsenal team I played against was more British than this one. But most clubs are losing that kind of identity now, not just in England.’

Cheap deal: Besiktas signed one-time Arsenal target Demba Ba, left, from Chelsea this summer

Instant impact: The Senegalese forward scored a hat-trick in the last qualification round against Feyenoord

There is a financial chasm between the two clubs. While Arsenal splashed out £35million on Sanchez, Besiktas signed Demba Ba from Chelsea for less than one-seventh of the price. 

Interest in Fulham’s Costa Rica player Bryan Ruiz has so far stalled because Besiktas can’t afford the £5m asking price.

Ba, who nearly joined Arsenal a year ago, scored a hat-trick in the previous round against Feyenoord and will be the Turkish club’s main threat. 

Riling: In 2007 Arsene Wenger said Turkish clubs were not good enough for latter stages of Champions League

Bilic dismisses however the idea Arsenal will be cowed by the atmosphere in Istanbul. ‘They went to Fenerbahce last year and won 3-0 with a cigar,’ he said. ‘The reputation of Turkish fans is prejudiced. Hostile and intimidating? Yes. Do they want to eat you? No.’

Even so, Wenger might get some special stick from fans with long memories.

The Arsenal manager stirred the pot after Liverpool beat Besiktas 8-0 in 2007 by suggesting Turkish clubs weren’t good enough to be allowed into the latter stages of the Champions League.

Caring approach: While in charge of Croatia, Bilic gave Luka Modric, right, money for coffee on away trips

Bilic’s warmth towards his players is his personal trademark. In his first job as Croatia youth coach, he once gave pocket money to a young Luka Modric and Vedran Corluka because they had no spending money, not even for a cup of coffee, on away trips. 

He may be the boss, but he’s also their friend. That might be the biggest threat of all to Wenger come Tuesday night.
