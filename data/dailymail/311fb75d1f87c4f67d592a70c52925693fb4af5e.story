This is one remarkable story of the undeniable love between a man and his best friend.

It took Richie, a 12-month-old Kelpie, 13 days to be finally reunited with his beloved owner Paul Galloway after falling off the back of his ute - 45km from home. And boy, was he happy to see him.

With a broken leg, a starved Richie survived on sheep and cattle dung as he trekked it back to Mr Galloway's Adelong farm in south-western NSW.

Mr Galloway's bond with Richie began when they first met four months ago.

'I've always been a dog lover and always had them around,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was ready to adopt another one and when I went over to the animal shelter, Richie appealed to me the most.

'He was of three in the litter and had the best personality. He was excited, affectionate and just wanted someone to take him home.'

Since then, the pair have been inseparable. So taking Richie on a trip to neighbouring town Gundagai on June 20 was no exception.

But it was only when Mr Galloway, from Wagga Wagga in south-western regional NSW, arrived at his destination that he realised his dog was missing.

Mr Galloway was driving to Gundagai, south-western NSW, with his 12-month-old pup in the back of his ute on June 20

But on the way, Richie got lost and couldn't be found when his owner went back to find him

'Richie was chained to the back because I was doing sharp turns on the highway but when I arrived at the place I went around the back and saw no dog,' Mr Galloway said.

'The collar had come undone and I presumed Richie had jumped off onto the highway.'

So Mr Galloway went back to retrace his tracks several times.

'I drove up and down the highway, hoping to see a dog roaming around,' he said.

By then, Mr Galloway had feared the worst.

'I was travelling about 100km an hr so I knew it would've been a pretty tough fall for him,' he said.

'I was half expecting to see him dead on the side of the road but I just wanted to find him.'

He then received an unexpected call on Thursday afternoon.

'People on my Adelong farm asked me if I knew anything about a black dog which was just sitting on the verandah,' Mr Galloway said.

'They told me he had a flea collar and that's when I knew it was my dog.'

Richie is clearly a great addition to the Galloway family as he's been described as a loyal and affectionate pup

Mr Galloway says he was 'over the moon', jumped in the car straight away and drove to the farm.

'I couldn't believe it,' he said.

'Richie would've been hopping for most of that journey on his three good legs because he had a cut up the front left one. It nearly ripped off. The tear was pretty bad.'

A check from the local veterinary hospital revealed that Richie had survived on cattle and sheep dung while he was on the road for 13 days.

Although Richie has proved that he is one hell of a fighter, Mr Galloway revealed that this is the second time his dog has beat death.

'Three three weeks before Richie was lost he ate rat poisoning and survived,' Mr Galloway said.

Now the pup is said to be doing well and simply 'happy as Larry to be home'.

'He'll probably have a limp for awhile but he's a celebrity and going great guns,' Mr Galloway said.

When asked whether Richie will return to his post at the back of the ute, Mr Galloway said: 'oh he's progressed to first class and sits in the front seat.'

'He's getting the royal treatment now.'
