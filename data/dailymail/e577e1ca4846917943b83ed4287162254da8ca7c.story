The FA will need manager Roy Hodgson to do what he does best — talk a good game — to avoid the new Wembley attracting its lowest crowd for an England game when they face Norway on September 3.

England fans, after that abysmal World Cup showing in Brazil, unsurprisingly have little enthusiasm for the reciprocal friendly game against unglamorous Scandinavian opposition with only around 10,000 tickets so far sold.

Low point: Just 57,897 watched England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra in 2009

This means the FA have a huge selling task to get anywhere near the Wembley audience of 57,897 who watched the World Cup qualifier against Andorra in June 2009 during a Tube strike — the smallest England attendance since the stadium was rebuilt in 2007.

Hodgson has not managed to find those marginal gains from England players needed to progress in major tournaments. But he cannot be faulted for his charming demeanour off the pitch when he promotes his team to the public.

This will kick off with a big interview on Sky Sports News, his first since the World Cup, when he needs to start drumming up interest in that Norway game ahead of the critical Euro 2016 qualifier away to Switzerland. The FA are also planning a print and online marketing campaign to help sell discounted seats but Hodgson must make the most of his media rounds, squad announcement and choice of new captain.

FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission are due to produce a second report on improving coaching this autumn.

Considering Danny Mills (right) is the most enthusiastic member of Dyke’s panel, his views on clubs employing specialist coaches is illuminating — especially as the England party in Brazil was top heavy with experts in every field. 

Mills says: ‘By the time I was at Leeds, we had sports scientists and conditioning coaches — or as I used to call them, job justifiers. 

'In their world, what works for you one summer is forbidden practice a year later and as a player that is irritating. If you have experience, you know what you need.’

MK Dons shouldn’t overstock their bars or bank on selling too many programmes for Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against AFC Wimbledon. Away fans have vowed not to spend any money on their relocated club premises and plan to eat before the game in the nearby IKEA store. Wimbledon directors will also sit with their own fans rather than enter the MK boardroom.

You would imagine the FA were intending to re-empower their international committee, which used to be responsible for hiring and firing the England manager, judging by its new-look membership. 

The revamped committee, chaired by Arsenal’s Ivan Gazidis, includes Football League independent director Richard Bowker, Notts County’s Jim Rodwell, Crystal Palace’s Phil Alexander and Sunderland’s Margaret Byrne.

Yet this committee hasn’t met since March 2011 nor, say the FA, is there any chance of them doing so with their role remaining purely ambassadorial and far more suited to retired blazers rather than busy club CEOs. Even by FA standards, this is ridiculous. If you appoint club leaders, let them have a say on Hodgson and England business. 

Johnno enjoys the ride

Former England rugby captain Martin Johnson, who has seemingly taken three years to recover from being team manager during the 2011 World Cup debacle in New Zealand, is slowly returning to a public sporting profile.

Johnson was involved in the Prudential RideLondon event, opening the cycling show and being one of the celebrity riders. And he’s expected to take a part in England Rugby 2015’s World Cup build-up.

The Emirates sponsorship of Old Trafford caused problems during the fourth Test, with rival airline Etihad backing the England team. It was resolved by Etihad being allowed no perimeter advertising during the game but having exposure via the big screen.

Meanwhile, it hasn’t gone unnoticed how often the conflicted Lancashire board member Paul Allott plugs the ‘Emirates Old Trafford’ while presenting Sky’s Cricket Writers on TV but fails to mention other cricket ground sponsors so readily.
