Users of the Vine app now have to say they are over 17 after porn was uploaded to the site

Twitter's new mobile video-sharing app Vine has had its age rating increased after it was flooded with porn.

It has been raised from 12+ on Apple's store to 17+, which is the highest rating.

The software was launched last month and within days hundreds of hardcore porn videos were uploaded, leading to complaints from angry users. 

Twitter was forced to apologise just weeks after the launch when a six-second pornographic clip was promoted as an 'editor's pick'.

The new rating is used for videos with 'frequent/ intense sexual content or nudity'.

Vine users are asked to confirm they are over 17 by clicking on a window, but that is the only age verification system in place.

Videos are not vetted before being uploaded but it has been announced that users will be able to block or report items they find offensive.

Vine - dubbed the Instagram for video - is designed to encourage members to share clips recorded on their smartphones.

It extends Twitter’s 140-character ethos to video, with clips limited to just six seconds.

When the hardcore porn video appeared in January, children's charities said it was an example of how easily children can stumble on pornographic images.

Twitter blamed human error and had the video removed.

A spokesman said at the time: ‘A human error resulted in a video with adult content becoming one of the videos in Editor’s Picks, and upon realising this mistake we removed the video immediately.

'We apologise to our users for the error.’

Twitter has also restricted searchable items. Users can no longer get results by searching words such as porn, sex and naked.
