Conman: Police sources say Bunty (pictured) might have feigned mental illness to avoid arrest

Devinder Singh aka Bunty Chor, the maverick conman arrested in Bhopal last week, was brought on transit remand to Delhi on Wednesday afternoon and sent to two days police custody by a local court.

Bunty was brought back to the Capital on transit remand after the Delhi Police confirmed his involvement in a carjacking incident in New Friends Colony of south-east Delhi.

A salesman at a jeweller’s shop in Haryana had identified Bunty earlier this month, where he had gone to purchase silver jewellery after stealing the car from NFC.

However, he gave the slip to the Haryana Police as well and managed to reach Bhopal.

'He has been identified and we are questioning him about the carjacking incident as well,' additional commissioner of police (southeast) Ajay Choudhury said.

Sources in the Delhi Police said Bunty might have feigned mental illness— he claimed to be an incarnation of Jesus Christ— to avoid being arrested, but he was 'really upset after his family members, including his girlfriend, disowned him and did not come to his help to start a normal life'.

Bunty was arrested by the Delhi Police in 2007 for a spate of robberies in south Delhi.

After his release in 2008, he had vowed to lead a normal life. But sources said Bunty had reverted to his old ways for the past two months now.

'His last five cases of theft and carjacking were not professionally planned. He probably took to crime again as his dear ones didn’t help him start a new life. Had he been his former self, it would have been impossible to arrest him,' said a Delhi police official who has interrogated Bunty on several occasions.

Bunty has reportedly been involved in over 500 theft cases and managed to dodge the police on a number of occasions.

Though Bunty was not choosy about what he stole, he had a weakness for luxury cars and fancy watches. He was arrested on January 14 in Bhopal, following a tip-off that a man resembling the infamous Bunty Chor was roaming in the old city area.

Initially, he tried to fool the police by saying his name was Napolean Jesus and that he came to Bhopal from Hong Kong. He later claimed he belonged to Nepal.
