Luke Shaw has allayed fears the injury he picked up in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Everton will leave him on the sidelines.

The 19-year-old limped off after 70 minutes in Louis van Gaal's side's Old Trafford win on Sunday.

But Shaw played down fears over the incident and revealed his is looking forward to joining up with England under-21s for the international break.

Shaw has revealed that the injury was no more than a dead leg and he will report for England Under-21 duty

England young Lions face Croatia twice in the Euro 2015 play-off and Shaw is hopeful of playing.

'It's not a bad injury, it's a dead leg on my knee,' he said.

'I felt it in the first 20 minutes when I got caught but it carried on during the game so I thought it was probably best to come off before it gets any worse.

'I spoke with the doctor and obviously the manager as well and both feel it's best that I do go with the Under 21s as it's not an injury that is going to keep me out. 

'Hopefully, I should be training in the next couple of days and can get another two games of 90 minutes each.

'As I said, I've been talking to the manager and we've spoken about it and think it's a great idea for me to go to help out with the Under 21s and get some game-time as well.'

The left back revealed England manager Roy Hodgson assured him that missing out on the England team to help the Under 21s was not a punishment.

'I spoke to Roy about it and he rang me the week before it came out and said it's not a punishment or anything like that,' said Shaw. 'I'm not dropping down there because I haven't been playing so it's for me to help out the Under 21s.'

'It's not just me - Calum Chambers and Berahino might have got a call-up. We're all happy to help. It's always been a privilege to play for my country, no matter what level it is and I will do it and do my best.' 

Shaw has been unavailable for the Under 21s in the past because of injuries but is looking forward to stepping up to help Southgate's young side in the matches with Croatia.

'I've been unlucky with the Under 21s as I've had a lot of injuries but I still feel I can go and help out. I'm really looking forward to it.'

'Of course, I always want to help out my country and I know there are few other lads who can also drop down as well that summer. Who knows yet?

'Obviously, I've had a little discussion about it with Gareth Southgate but nothing too big. I'm away with them for the next couple of weeks and can get to talk about it properly then (should England qualify)'

Meanwhile, Shaw has thanked goalkeeper David de Gea for saving Leighton Baines' penalty in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Everton after the left back brought down Tony Hibbert in the area to give away a penalty.

'It was a great win. I'm not going to say the penalty was a bad decision but it was one I did not feel was right,' said Shaw. 'I thought I touched the ball and, if you look at the replay, I think you can see I do touch the ball.

'I'm devastated it was a penalty but all thanks to David De Gea. I did Tweet straight afterwards to thank him! He was world-class and made us get the three points. 

'It was a good game overall but, at times, we need to keep possession as we've been giving it away too cheaply and it's costing goals from that. We know we can do much better than today. The main thing, overall, is the three points.'
