Young stars from a number of leading Premier League clubs feature in the England under 18 squad for a double-header against Switzerland later this month.

Chelsea's Dominic Solanke, Tammy Abraham and Jake Clarke-Salter, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo, Arsenal's Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Tottenham's Joshua Onomah and Newcastle's Adam Armstrong are included in the 20-man group named by coach Neil Dewsnip.

The Young Lions first face the Swiss in a behind-closed-doors friendly in Telford on March 26 and again at Walsall's Banks's Stadium on March 28.

Chelsea's Dominic Solanke is included in the England under 18 squad to take on Switzerland next week

Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo, currently on loan at Wigan, has also received a call-up for the double-header

Dewsnip has called four players up for the first time - Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman, Sheffield United's Louis Reed, Tottenham's Luke Amos and Middlesbrough forward Harry Chapman.

'It’s important to challenge all the England teams,' said Dewsnip.

'We have played Holland twice, Italy away and then Poland away twice this season and, particularly for this group of players, they did ever so well in winning the Euros last year.

'It is important that we build on that momentum. They are a talented group and we want to give them tough challenges.

'Traditionally the Swiss youth teams are very competitive and they will be very well organised and hard to beat.

'We want to pit our wits against that and see if we can perform well and win both games – carrying on that momentum to take them into their under 19 year next season.'
