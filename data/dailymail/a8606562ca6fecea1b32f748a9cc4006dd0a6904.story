If you’ve ever wanted to name part of Mars after yourself, now is your chance.

A Colorado-based company is giving anyone the ability to give their moniker to one of the red planet’s 500,000 unnamed craters.

And, as long as you have a few pounds change in your pocket, you don’t need to be a scientist or astronaut to take part in the project.

The world's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of Mars' craters, saying the red planet is not up for sale

The opportunity has been provided as part of a mapping project run by the space-funding company, Uwingu.

The smallest craters, given on a first-come-first-served basis, will set you back around $5 (£3) with prices increasing based on the size of the crater. 

If all the craters on Mars are named, Uwingu will raise $10 million (£6 million), which it plans to use to fund grants in space exploration, research and education.

‘This is the first people's map of Mars, where anybody can play,’ Uwingu chief executive Alan Stern, told Space.com. ‘It's a very social thing’

‘We're developing this grant fund — the Uwingu fund — for people who've been hit by sequestration.

‘There's nothing like it right now. They have no place to go; it's either Nasa, NSF [the National Science Foundation] or you're out of luck.’

The company hopes to gain names for other features on Mars if it hits its target of naming all the craters by the end of 2014.

‘Only imagination limits your naming choices,’ the company writes on their website.

The IAU said the public can get involved in naming of craters when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas.

Craters less than 62 miles (100km) in diameter are named after towns on Earth with fewer than 100,000 people. 

Craters wider than this are named after late planetary scientists. Using that scheme, a large crater might someday be named after Carl Sagan or Eugene Shoemaker.

One, for instance, has been named after Hal Masursky, a geologist who spent his career at Nasa studying lunar and planetary surfaces and the best places for landing.

‘Names of Martian craters in this new Mars map can honour individuals, living or deceased, pets, places on Earth or in space, sports teams, musical groups, countries, fictional characters - its up to you.’

Mr Stern said the project could provide some interesting insights into what people are thinking about and what’s important to them.

Duplicate names are allowed in different districts and provinces on Mars just as street names in different cities on Earth can be the same.

For each crater you named, an electronic certificate is issued with the name, date and details of the crater.

The 15,000 red planet features whose names have been approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) will be added into Uwingu's base map.

However, Uwingu will not get approval from the IAU, who is the body that approves the names of space bodies and their features.

Uwingu's founders said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days

The names will be unofficial and there are no plans to have them approved by the International Astronomical Union
