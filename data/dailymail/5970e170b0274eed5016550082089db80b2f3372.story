Having X-Ray vision may sound like fantasy, but these images give a glimpse of what it would be like to see what's hidden inside people's bags, pockets, and even beneath their clothes.

For his latest work, 'X-ray voyeurism, British artist Nick Veasey used an X-ray machine to take images of people and object separately, before mashing them together to create characters and situations.

Unlike a typical photographer's studio, his involved warning sirens, flashing lights, and lead lined doors to protect against radiation.

Veasey, 51, says he never set out to be an artist but his work evolved of it’s own accord from his love for X-ray images.

What lies beneath: Artist Nick Veasey used X-rays to create these pictures. In the left image a stripper is seen leaning against her pole with a wad of notes tucked into her suspenders, while the girl on the right carries beauty accessories in her bag and what appears to be two condoms in her back pocket

All is not what it seems: The left image shows a 'geek' carrying fantasy role-playing cards and glasses, but look closer and you will see she is also wearing lacy underwear - while the man wearing glasses on the right look ordinary, until you spot drug paraphernalia such as a bong stashed in his front pocket 

A business doing pleasure with you: The X-ray of this businessman's briefcase shows a laptop, smarthpone and diary - alongside a mouth gag and kinky handcuffs

Pins and needles: This photograph shows an elderly lady out for a walk, revealing a bag full of wool and knitting needles, and also a metal hip replacement pin in her thigh

Anarchy in the UK: A punk rocker is pictured left complete with safety pin piercings and studded jacket, while in the right picture a skater grinds along a railing
