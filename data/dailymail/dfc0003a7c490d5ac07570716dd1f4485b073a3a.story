From package holidays to second homes, Britons are now returning to Benidorm in droves.

In the 1970s it was the holiday destination of choice for sun-seeking Britons.

The region is the most popular on Spain’s mainland for foreign buyers, according to land registry figures which show the proportion of villas and apartments bought by overseas buyers has almost tripled in the past four years to 11.15 per cent.

Holidaymakers enjoy the sun and the beach life of Benidorm during its 1970s heyday. The region went from a must-go holiday resort to a place to be avoided to now a place for people to buy a second home

British buyers have taken advantage of the pound’s strength against the euro. Typically, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom villa with a pool is £158,000.

The area is also popular because budget airlines fly to nearby Alicante from regional UK airports and not just London ones.

But there is also a sense of nostalgia for Britons returning to a region of Spain that became famous for being among the first destinations for mass market package tours.

Even the name Costa Blanca for the 125-mile coastline was invented by British airline BEA when it opened a route to Valencia, the capital of the region, in 1957.

In the following decade, newly launched cheap package holidays took off with Benidorm, Altea and Alicante being among the first places to attract hordes of British sunseekers.

Unfortunately the region suffered from an image of ugly high rise hotels, parades of British pubs and legions of lager louts from Britain getting drunk in nightclubs.

Kieran Byrne, the managing director of HomeEspana said: ‘The sustained weakness of the euro this year is helping to attract more British and Scandinavian buyers.

‘We don't expect a rapid turnaround in market conditions in Spain, but at least in the Costa Blanca we have seen increased buyer interest in the first quarter of 2014.

‘More second homebuyers from abroad are discovering how far their money goes here.’

Benidorm has tried to shed its image as a haven for British lager louts, although it is still portrayed as downmarket in ITV comedy Benidorm.
