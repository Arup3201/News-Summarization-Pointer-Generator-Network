Risk: The obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in Britain, with the toll set to increase in the next decade (file picture)

The obesity epidemic is being blamed for 12,000 cancer cases a year in Britain, with the toll set to increase in the next decade.

The biggest study of its kind shows that being fat is a major risk factor for the most common cancers, triggering more than one in ten cases.

The chances of developing some forms of the disease are up to 60 per cent higher, with the risk often rising in tandem with weight gain.

Researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall-bladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers in the UK.

If Britons continue to pile on the pounds, it will lead to almost 4,000 extra cancer cases a year by 2026.

Study leader Dr Krishnan Bhaskaran, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said people had made the connection with obesity being a cause of heart disease and diabetes.

But he said there was a worrying lack of awareness about the link with cancer, even though two out of three adults are overweight or obese.

‘The number of people who are overweight or obese is rapidly increasing both in the UK and worldwide,’ he said. ‘It is well recognised that this is likely to cause more diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our results show that if these trends continue, we can also expect to see substantially more cancers as a result.’

The study used data from GP records involving more than five million Britons aged 16 and older who were cancer-free and had been followed for an average of seven-and-a-half years.

The risk of developing 22 of the most common cancers was estimated according to body mass index (BMI), a measurement relating weight to height.

Higher BMI increases the risk of developing ten of the most common cancers, says the study published in The Lancet medical journal.

Over 12,000 cases of these ten cancers each year are attributable to being overweight or obese, say researchers at the School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the Farr Institute of Health Informatics.

'The higher the BMI, the higher the risk': Researchers estimate that excess weight could account for 41 per cent of womb cancers and 10 per cent or more of gall-bladder, kidney, liver, and colon cancers in the UK

They calculate that if average BMI in the population continues to increase at the same rate – about half a stone on average over the next 12 years – there could be more than 3,790 extra cancers in 2026 as a result.

Almost 167,000 people developed one of the 22 cancers studied over the follow-up period and BMI was associated with 17 of the 22 examined.

A healthy or normal weight is a BMI score of 18.5 to 24.99; above that is a sliding scale to life-threatening fatness.

Carrying an extra two stones in weight over and above the ‘healthy’ range was clearly linked with higher risk of some cancers, and the risk went up with further weight gain.

‘The higher the BMI, the higher the risk,’ said Dr Bhaskaran.

The rise in cancer of the womb was 62 per cent higher, gall-bladder 31 per cent, kidney 25 per cent, cervix 10 per cent, thyroid and leukaemia 9 per cent higher. Higher BMI also increased the risk of other cancers including liver (19 per cent), colon (10 per cent), ovarian (9 per cent), and breast cancers (5 per cent).

Even within normal or ‘healthy’ weight ranges, higher BMI was associated with increased risk of some cancers.

However, those with high BMI may be at a slightly reduced risk of prostate cancer and pre-menopausal breast cancer.

Dr Bhaskaran said: ‘This variation tells us that BMI must affect cancer risk through a number of different processes, depending on the cancer type.

‘But the take home message is that putting on weight substantially increases your risk of many of these cancers.’

Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘We are still not getting the message across about the link between excess weight and cancer. Trying to keep a healthy weight is important, but you can reduce your cancer risk even if you’re obese by becoming more physically active.’
