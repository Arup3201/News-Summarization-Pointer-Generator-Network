A 44-year-old woman who nearly caused two police officers to crash while they were on their way to an emergency call, told officers she was 'awesome' and asked if they wanted to dance.

Julie Kay Harper, who was pulled over in the early hours of Saturday after nearly driving into a car, admitted to having a few beers with a friend before driving home.

The Florida woman, who told police she thought she was in trouble, was arrested for driving under the influence after failing a roadside sobriety test.

Arrested: Julie Harper said she was too fat to walk in a straight line when asked to do a roadside sobriety test

Police were first alerted to Harper as they responded to a call about a house being burgled on Saturday, according to TC Palm.

Her driving allegedly caused two police cars to swerve out the way as she negotiated a turn in the road, police reports said.

When a Sergeant with the Indian River County's sheriff's office approached Harper in her car, and asked how she was, she replied 'awesome'.

The officer who first stopped Harper allegedly had to reach in her car and put it in 'park' after the woman let her foot off the brake of the car, causing it to lurch forwards.

When the 44-year-old was asked where she lived she told officers '53' adding that she had lived there for 'a minute'.

As the Sergeant asked her to confirm she had lived there only sixty seconds she said: 'That's it, yeah I know I'm f*****,' before adding that she felt like she was in trouble.

Matters took a turn for the worse for Harper after she was asked to complete a roadside sobriety test, which included following a light with her eyes and walking in a straight line.

When the Sergeant asked her to follow the light with her eyes she chucked and asked 'Are we gonna dance' before swaying in a small circular fashion as she continued the test, the police report showed.

And, as she attempted to walk in a straight line she complained: 'I can't, my fat, my legs are fat.'

Finally, the police asked her to stand on one leg which, after failing to do, Harper said: 'It's not gonna happen. Just f****** take me to jail.'

Harper refused a chemical breath test when she was taken to the police station. She was also charged with driving an unlicensed car on a suspended license.
