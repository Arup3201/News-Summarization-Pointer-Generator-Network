Family doctors are being told to prescribe a more active sex life to patients who need to get more exercise.

New guidelines say GPs should also recommend dancing and mowing the lawn as part of a drive to routinely prescribe activities.

Patients could then be called or texted by their doctor afterwards to make sure they are sticking to the advice, says the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges.

Family doctors are being told to prescribe a more active sex life to patients who need to get more exercise

The body says exercise is an often overlooked ‘miracle cure’ that can work far better than many drugs and could save the NHS billions a year by significantly reducing the risk of breast cancer, dementia, heart disease and even hip fractures.

But campaigners said it was no business of GPs to pry into the sex lives of their patients and warned that the advice risked causing offence. 

The College stated that regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent, dementia by 30 per cent, heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent.

Yet latest figures show that more than half of Britons, 56 per cent, fail to achieve the NHS’s recommended minimum amount of exercise of 30 minutes, five times a week.

And a Government-commissioned report last year warned that our average activity levels were the worst in the Western world and directly responsible for one in six deaths.

Lead author Scarlett McNally, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Eastbourne District General Hospital in Sussex, said even small amounts of exercise could make a ‘huge difference’. 

She said that for some illnesses, exercise was just as effective as drugs including for depression where it was often prescribed instead of Prozac.

‘It could be as simple as taking the stairs rather than a lift, kicking a ball about with your children or grandchildren.’ She added.

‘We’ve got to change what we think of as normal, because what we are seeing in our hospitals and surgeries up and down the country is that normal has become not enough exercise.’

‘Too many of my patients are paying the price for that with broken bones and years of ill-health that could have been avoided by being more active.’

The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent, dementia by 30 per cent, heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent

Although GPs are already urged to prescribe exercise for obese patients, the latest guidelines go further by routinely telling all patients to be more active.

The College, which represents 220,000 doctors, suggests patients are started off gently with daily brisk walks, using the stairs, dog-walking or having more sex. 

Its guidance states: ‘Many activities can be promoted; brisk walking, cycling, climbing stairs, dog-walking, using outdoor gyms and dancing – even sexual activity can bring some benefits.’

Professor Dame Sue Bailey, chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: ‘This is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it. 

'There really is a miracle cure staring us in the face, one which too many patients and doctors have quite simply forgotten about.’

But Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s none of GPs’ business to be talking about patients’ sex lives. I would take amiss at that and I’m sure many others would too.

‘This is particularly true as nowadays most patients don’t even know their family doctor.’
