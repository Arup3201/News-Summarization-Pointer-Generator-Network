Wombats are being buried to death during logging and it needs to stop now, the director of Wombat Protection Society said.

Marie Wynan and her husband Ray have been patrolling the Glenbog State Forest of south coast NSW but they are still discovering blocked burrows from excessive soil, logs, rocks or debris during logging.

The Nimmitabel couple, who run a wildlife sanctuary near their property, have marked over 150 wombat burrows with a GPS, reporting on damages and negotiating with the loggers so they could avoid bulldozing over burrows.

The NSW Environment Protection Authority confirmed the state government-owned Forestry Corporation of NSW had agreed to ensure entrances to the burrows were not obstructed by logging debris as it felled the southern forest, according to Sun-Herald.

But Ms Wynan told Daily Mail Australia that even restricting truck movements with planned out maps and markings had not been taken into consideration and were completely ignored by contractors.

'It's just heartbreaking when my husband and I find burrows that are compacted by machinery and logs. We can no longer reopen them because they're too deep,' she said.

'Wombats have not been able to dig themselves out and end up suffocating to death.'

'We can't interfere when they're logging but all we can do is go in after it's done and try to reopen the burrows again - that's all we can do for now.

'They are one of the most intelligent animals in the world and they are more clever than dogs.

'We really need to continue and push for legislation to give these wombats a second chance at life.'

The burrow backfilled three times and was sitting underneath an enormous pile of logs

The Wildlife Rescue South Coast members met with EPA officers from Sydney on Saturday to assure the loggers were following the agreement, as well as investigating the deaths of the wombats.

But Ms Wynan said the loggers had 'deliberately' removed the GPS markings and filled burrows in again once the EPA officers had left.

A Forestry Corporation spokesman said 'wombats use multiple burrows' and 'larger burrows generally have several entrances and wombats are able to re-excavate or remove obstacles at burrow entrances.'

With 25 years of observing bare-nosed wombats, Ms Wynan said these claims were untrue.

'Some people believe that wombats can dig themselves out but they don't have the strength to do so. When their burrows collapse or blocked from logging, they're trapped deep down, causing significant harm or drawn out deaths,' Ms Wynan said.

She told Sun-Herald that thorough searching had not uncovered a single burrow with more than one entrance and such burrows were rare for this variety of wombat.

The Australian Wildlife Society regional co-ordinator Linda Dennis said Forestry Corporation's comments were 'ridiculous.'

'The bare-nosed wombats just have one entrance in and out, so if it is ploughed over, that’s it. You are looking at a slow death with lack of food and water,' said Ms Dennis.

NSW Labor’s environment spokesman Luke Foley told Sun-Herald that Forestry Corporation should honour its agreement with the wildlife groups, which had been 'an opportunity for a positive community partnership to ameliorate the impacts of logging.'

'Wildlife carers spent many hours painstakingly marking and recording wombat burrows only to return and find callous disregard had been given to these harmless and vulnerable animals,' he said.
