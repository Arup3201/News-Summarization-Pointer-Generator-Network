Spain international Xabi Alonso has announced his retirement from international football after 114 games, two European Championships, and one World Cup.

The former Liverpool midfielder will be 33 in November and after playing in three World Cups he has decided to concentrate on his club career, following Spain's other X-man Xavi into international retirement.

In an open letter to the Spanish FA Alonso said: 'The hardest thing is to know when to say goodbye, but after it giving it a lot of thought, I believe the time has come.'   

Loyal servant: Xabi Alonso, 32, has announced his retirement from international football

'I have had a glorious time with Spain that started more than 11 years ago, including me forming part of an historic generation which realised the dream of millions of fans, achieving the unique feat of winning the World Cup and two European Championships in four years.

He paid tribute to his various international coaches, including Inaki Saez, 'the unforgettable' Luis Aragones and Vicente del Bosque. 

'[They] are people who have helped me improve in the right way both professionally and personally,' he said. 

'I can't count all the team-mates with whom I've worn this shirt, but I want to thank each and every one for all they have taught me during this unforgettable stage of my life.' 

Sad end: Alonso's international career ends after defending champions Spain's disastrous Brazil World Cup

Illustrious: After making his debut in 2003 (2003), Alonso won three major trophies with Spain

Kick in the guts: Alonso was famously kicked by Holland's Nigel De Jong during the 2010 World Cup final

And he also thanked the three clubs he has served adding: 'Real Sociedad, Liverpool and Real Madrid opened the doors to international football to me and they always helped and supported me.'

'Finally, I want to convey my sincere thanks to the fans,' he added.

'We shared the same dreams and enjoyed the glory together. I have experienced many unforgettable moments and you guys have been the protagonists.

'I want to wish luck to everybody who continues to fight for this shirt, holding the absolute conviction that we will experience glory once again.' 

Dead rubber: Alonso's last game for Spain was with nothing to play for but pride against Australia

Current Spain coach Del Bosque highlighted the importance of Alonso to the nation's recent triumphs.

He told sefutbol.com: 'It's very difficult to improve on what he has done.

'Together with his peers, he leaves behind a great legacy. He has been a great professional.

'The coaching staff and I hold him in great esteem and his behaviour has been impeccable for all this time.'

The international retirement of Xavi and Xabi coincides with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard's decision to quit the England team, though with Sergi Busquets, Thiago, Andres Iniesta, Koke, Javi Martinez and Ander Herrera they will feel slightly more protected against the loss of such international heavyweights.
