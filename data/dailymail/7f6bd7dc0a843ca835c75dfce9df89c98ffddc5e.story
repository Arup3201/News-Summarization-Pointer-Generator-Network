They were feather-light yet anchored faster than Britannia in a storm. With their vivid shades and contrasting colours they were often the most captivating aspect of their wearer’s outfit — without ever overshadowing the royal head atop which they sat.

Little wonder, then, that the hats of Philip Somerville have graced the heads of three generations of royal women: the Queen, Princess Diana and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The milliner, who died this week after a long career, was loved and trusted by the Queen — as well as countless celebrities, from Lady Thatcher to Joan Collins — for his ability to make appropriate yet fashion-forward headwear.

He could just as easily turn out a youthful feathered number for Kate as a turban or Diana in the Middle East or a diplomatic fur hat for Thatcher to meet Gorbachev in Moscow.

But it is his prodigious work for the Queen, for whom he created 40 or 50 hats a year, for which he will be best remembered.

Crucially, he had her complete confidence, which meant she trusted his judgment and was willing to explore different shapes and colours.

His hats, while elegant and deceptively simple, moved royal style away from the small, back-of-crown affairs favoured by the Queen Mother and the young Queen to something much more striking and substantial.

The son of a cobbler from Winchester, Somerville would visit the Queen at Buckingham Palace for fittings, after being sent swathes of fabric and dress designs from which to work up matching headpieces. He was far from intimidated by the experience.

‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said: “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right,” ’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s used to that.’

After agreeing the style, colour and fabric, he would then create the hat by hand on a wooden block and return to fit it again in person.

Somerville had a similar impact on Diana, encouraging her towards bigger brimmed, bright hats with contrasting bands, from under which her heavily made-up eyes would peer out.

He explained that she could get away with such huge headwear because of her statuesque figure. As he put it: ‘You could still see her underneath.’

And his love of modern design meant that well into retirement age he was still making hats that looked up-to-date on Kate, 50 years his junior.
