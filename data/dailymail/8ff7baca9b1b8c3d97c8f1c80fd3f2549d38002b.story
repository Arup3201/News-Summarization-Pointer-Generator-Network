Liverpool have submitted plans to expand Anfield by almost 15,000 after having proposals to renovate the stadium approved by local residents, businesses and fans.

If the plans are accepted by Liverpool City Council the Reds will add an extra 8,500 seats to the Main Stand and a further 4,800 to the Anfield Road stand and have tentatively scheduled a completion date for the 2016-17 season.

With an answer due later this year, Liverpool have also proposed incorporating the club's crest into the elevation of the Main Stand and a carefully designed cloister which would house the Hillsborough Memorial.

The future: Liverpool's plans for Anfield will see the capacity grow to almost 60,000

Expansion: The main stand will house an extra 8,500 seats and the Anfield Road stand will take another 4,800

Tom Doyle, an experienced project director who worked on the London 2012 Olympic programme and the SSE Hydro Arena in Glasgow, has been appointed to oversee the proposed expansion.

Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre underlined the central role that local residents and businesses had played in the club's thinking.

He said: 'When we set out on the journey to explore the feasibility of expanding the stadium, we said the process would be determined by certainty.

'Certainty that we have the support from local residents and businesses for our proposed plans, that we can acquire the land required and that we can navigate the planning landscape.

'Over the past 18 months and as part of this approach, we have worked closely with the community, local residents, Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group and we are delighted to be able to bring forward a planning application at this stage.

'A lot of good work has been done and we still have more work to achieve certainty; however, the planning application is another step in the right direction.'

Moving on up: Liverpool finished second in the Premier League and will hope to continue that success

The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, revealed that the redevelopment would see £260 million invested with hundreds of jobs created as a result.

He said: 'The proposed redevelopment of the stadium is a hugely important part of our vision for Anfield - to create a thriving community in which people want to live, work and visit.

'The overall regeneration of the area will see £260m invested and will deliver hundreds of jobs. Liverpool Football Club's proposals for the stadium are a key part of this so today is a really important milestone.'
