A high school special education teacher who is accused of sleeping with a number of male students has been seen in court for the first time since being released on bail.

Summer Hansen, 31, entered a not guilty plea and asserts that she is being set up by the boys, saying that they are all working together against her.

She faces accusations of having sex with five students and sending them naked pictures, thought it is unclear whether those pictures are a part of the stockpile of evidence that the prosecution plans to reveal during her trial.

The married mother-of-three also dyed her hair light brown which marks a clear difference from the peroxide blonde that she sported at the time of her arrest in June.

The five boys involved in the case are all under 18-years-old and none of them were her students but they did attend the school where she taught, Centennial High School in Corona, California.

She was accused of having sex with the various boys in her classroom, the school utility closet, her car, and in one of their homes.

Her attorney says that they coordinating their stories.

'Do teenagers lie? Sure they do. Do they say something and then really believe it and move forward? Yes,' defense attorney David Cohn told local station KTLA.

'These boys all know each other. If 
they didn’t know each other and had no connection to each other, then 
you would start to wonder.'

Hansen
has been suspended without pay and on Thursday she was ordered to stay 
away from any children with the exception of her own.

'We
don’t have any objection to the teaching part of it, but there are 
family friends, relatives, things of that nature,' Mr Cohn said.

The
investigation into Hansen began when a school district employee called 
the police tipping them off to possible inappropriate relationships 
between Hansen and students.

Hansen has been charged with multiple counts of engaging in unlawful sex and oral copulation of a minor.

If found guilty, she could face up to 13 years in prison.
