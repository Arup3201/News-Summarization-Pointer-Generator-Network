New York’s latest spectacular riverfront attraction looks set to be a $170 million island park and open-air performance space on the Hudson River.

The grand scheme, called Pier 55, was announced on Monday and the majority of the funding for the project will be provided by billionaire Barry Diller and his fashion designer wife Diane von Furstenberg.

The 2.7-acre park will be built on an undulating platform jutting about 180-feet into the Hudson at West 14th Street, not far from the lower end of the highly popular High Line urban park.

Pier 55 will look more like an island than a pier and will sit atop 341 concrete columns that will range in height from 70 feet above the water to 15 feet above - roughly the minimum required post-Hurricane Sandy

The undulating form is also an attempt to address environmental issues. It will allow more sunlight to come through for fish in an area that has been designated a marine sanctuary.

Two pedestrian walkways from a widened West Street esplanade will take visitors to the free-to-all park which has been designed by British firm Heatherwick Studio and landscape architect Mathews Nielsen.

The park will replace the narrow and crumbling, flat-topped structure of Pier 54. That is where the steamship Carpathia brought survivors of the sunken Titanic 102 years ago and the rusty Cunard arch that stands at the foot of the pier will be restored to maintain a link with the past.

Diller, chairman of the New York-based media company IAC/Inter-ActiveCorp, and the Hudson River Trust made the announcement on Monday.

He and von Furstenberg, have agreed to provide $140 million to build and maintain the attraction through their family foundation.

The city will provide $17 million for the project while the state will offer $18 million for an adjacent esplanade.

As well as grass and trees, the park will have three venues to play host to arts events and performances under the direction of a team headed by Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin

‘We are deeply appreciative of the generosity of great New Yorkers like Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg without whom this visionary project would not have been possible,’ said NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio.

'I have always loved public spaces,' said Diller. 'It’s entirely my fault that this has become so ambitious. We will fail in our ambition, outsized or whatever it may be, if this doesn’t feel completely like a park and completely like a performance space.' 

'New York has always reminded me of Venice, so I am happy the time has come to properly honor its waterways,' added Von Furstenberg, 67. 

The park's three venues will host arts events and performances under the direction of a team headed by Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin, whose screen credits include The Social Network and Moonrise Kingdom. Most entertainment events will be free or low cost.  

No city approval is needed for work to begin on the park and the Hudson River Park Trust will now undertake a 60-day public review and comment period.

The trust board is expected to green-light the plan in early 2015. Esplanade construction is to start in 2015 and on the pier in 2015, with completion in late 2018 or early 2019.

Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg are also the single largest private donor to the High Line, the elevated park that has spurred residential development and international interest in the meatpacking district. The couple have both also built architecturally distinctive corporate headquarters in the area.
