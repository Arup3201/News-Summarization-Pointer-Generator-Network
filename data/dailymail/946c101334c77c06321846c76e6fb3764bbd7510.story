There will be ‘no going back’ if Scotland votes for indepdenence, David Cameron warned today.

The Prime Minister said the country faces a ‘monumental battle to keep our United Kingdom together’ ahead of September’s referendum.

And he insisted it was a ‘myth’ that warnings about the impact on business, the currency and the EU were empty ‘scaremongering’.

Mr Cameron said a Yes vote would mean 'total separation' with no 'second chances'

Mr Cameron hinted at more devolved powers for Scotland if voters reject independent on September 18

In a speech to the Scottish Conservative party spring conference in Edinburgh, Mr Cameron hinted that the Scottish Parliament could gain more power over tax if voters reject independence.

He insisted that a No vote on September 18 is ‘not the end of line’ for devolution but stopped short of spelling out any detail on what those powers could be.

In his 20-minute speech, the Prime Minister insisted there will be ‘no going back’ if voters say Yes to independence.

He praised the ‘spirit’ of the party in Scotland, which has just one MP at Westminster.

And he drew on recent interventions from major businesses, such as BP and Shell, in the referendum debate.

He also vowed to tackle accusations of ‘scaremongering’ over the country's future, saying he wants to ‘take that myth apart’.

Mr Cameron warned that a Yes vote would tear apart the UK family of nations

Dire warnings of the impact on jobs and the economy could not be dismissed as scaremongering by the Yes campaign, Mr Cameron insisted

‘Six months from now the day will dawn, the polling booths will open, the voters will come out and the people of Scotland will decide - stay or go, stick with the UK or walk away,’ he said.

‘If the Scottish people vote Yes in September, then Scotland will become an independent country, there will be no going back, no second chances.’

He added: ‘We face a monumental battle to keep our United Kingdom together.’

An opinion poll this week put support for independence at its highest level for more than six months. The Survation poll suggests 39.3 per cent will vote for independence, compared with 47.6 per cent who said they want Scotland to remain part of the UK.

Mr Cameron, who praised Tory leader in Scotland Ruth Davidson, added: ‘Let me be absolutely clear: a vote for “no” is not a vote for “no change”. We are committed to making devolution work better still.

Earlier Mr Cameron had lunch with staff at Scottish Widows in Edinburgh,

‘Not because we want to give Alex Salmond a consolation prize if Scotland votes No, but because it's the right thing to do.

‘Giving the Scottish Parliament greater responsibility for raising more of the money it spends - that's what Ruth believes, and I believe it too.

‘So here's the re-cap: vote yes, that is total separation.

‘Vote no, that can mean further devolution - more power to the Scottish people and their parliament, but with the crucial insurance policy that comes with being part of the UK.’

But the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign group said the promise is a sham.

Chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘The trouble is that we have heard it all before and it is clear from what the Prime Minister said today in his speech that he cannot and will not guarantee more powers for the Scottish Parliament.

‘With Labour also hopelessly split on more powers, the message to take from all of this is very clear: that the only way the people of Scotland can be guaranteed to get the powers they want and the country needs is to vote Yes on September 18.’
