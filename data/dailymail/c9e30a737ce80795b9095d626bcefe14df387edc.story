The U.S. Senate on Friday
struggled to pass a $1.1trillion spending bill that would avert
a looming federal government shutdown, postponing a vote until
Monday when procedural hurdles begin to evaporate.

Negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to speed the
process along collapsed during late-night talks in the nearly
abandoned U.S. Capitol.

Barring any agreement to act in a more streamlined way, the
Senate is on track to hold a procedural vote at 1am eastern
time Sunday aimed at clearing the way for passage on
Monday.

Night-time troubles: Hopes of passing a bill quickly evaporated - but senators will hope they can reach an agreement on Monday

The breakdown in talks capped a week in which passage of the
massive spending bill to fund most of the government through
Sept. 30, 2015, advanced in fits and starts.

Some senators, angered over the bill's easing of a
'Dodd-Frank' bank regulation law requirement, wanted a shot at
removing the provision.

But demands from some conservative Republicans for a
separate vote on an amendment to immediately defund President
Barack Obama's implementation of a recently announced
immigration program further stymied the bill's progress on
Friday.

In order to keep federal agencies operating beyond midnight
Saturday, when existing funds expire, the Senate is expected to
pass sometime Saturday a stop-gap bill to temporarily fund the
government through the middle of next week.

The House of Representatives already passed such a measure
anticipating the Senate's inability to finish the broad spending
bill this week.

The 1,603-page spending bill, negotiated by Republican and
Democratic appropriators and leaders, narrowly passed the House
on Thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in
Obama's Democratic Party.

A revolt over financial provisions by House Democratic
leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of
tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Democrats, aware of the need for unity when Republicans take
full control of Congress next year after their midterm election
gains, tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between
Obama and Pelosi.

One leadership aide said Pelosi had fired a
warning shot to Republicans that House Democrats would fight
hard in the new year.

Reid opened Friday's debate on the bill urging quick
passage. 'Since 2011 we have lurched from crisis to crisis with
the country constantly under the threat of shutdown or financial
catastrophe,' he said.

McConnell was also anxious to avoid another unpopular
government shutdown as the Republicans head toward taking
control of the Senate after the November elections that also
gave them a larger House majority. 

In the 219-206 House vote, 67 Republicans rejected the
spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop
Obama's immigration order. But that was offset by 57 Democrats
who voted in favor.

The spending bill would fund all government agencies through
September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security,
which would get an extension only through Feb. 27. That is the
department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced
by Obama last month.
