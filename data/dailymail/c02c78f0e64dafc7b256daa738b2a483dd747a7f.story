Gremio have been banned from this year's Brazilian Cup after fans racially insulted an opposition player in a match last week.

A tribunal also fined the club around $20,000 [£12,150] and said the fans found responsible for the abuse will be banned from attending matches for two years.

Wednesday's ruling comes less than a week after a small group of fans called Santos goalkeeper Aranha a "monkey" in a Brazilian Cup match at the Arena Gremio. Some also imitated monkey noises towards the player.

Punishment: Gremio has indefinitely suspended one of its fan groups after tehe incident

Gremio said it will appeal the ruling. The return match remains suspended until a final ruling is made. Santos won the first leg 2-0 in Porto Alegre.

Gremio have won the Brazilian Cup four times and are currently managed by former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.
