The world most expensive bed has been crafted to honour the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

The £125,000 ‘Royal State Bed’ takes more than 700 hours to complete and is fashioned from Latin American horse tail, Mongolian cashmere and 1,600 miles of woven silk thread.

Mattress company Savoir is making 60 editions of ‘The Royal State Bed,’ unveiled at the British company’s New York showroom today.

Golden mark: The £125,000 bed is marked with the Savoir motto 'Dorme bene, vive bene' meaning 'Sleep well, live well'

‘We wanted to create the very best,’ 
said Alistair Hughes, managing director of Savoir Beds, explaining that 
it takes inspiration from the beds of the British Royal households of 
the 17th and 18th century.

‘At that time, the bed was the center of everything. If you wanted to see the king you had to come to the bedroom.

‘The bed was sort of like the throne. It was the only thing other than the throne you had to bow at.’

At £125,000 it is far beyond the IKEA price range, but Mr Hughes believes the ‘Royal State Bed’ is worth every penny.

‘Clearly, it’s an expensive bed, 
there’s no questioning that,” Alistair Hughes, the bedmaker’s chief 
executive officer, told The Daily Beast. 

‘But that reflects the work that goes into it, the craftsmanship, and the materials we use.’

Purchasers of a ‘Royal State Bed’ can 
chose their own décor, and when posed with a possible New York Yankees 
bed cover and a falafel sandwich crest, Mr Hughes was unflinching.

‘We’d be delighted. We make a bespoke product.’

Although the horsetail hair is imported from Latin America and the cashmere is Mongolian, the bed is truly British.

The bed is made in Britain, the silk 
thread comes from Suffolk, and the crest above the bed is made by the 
Royal School of Needlework at Hampton Court, the very same who produced 
the intricate details on the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress.
