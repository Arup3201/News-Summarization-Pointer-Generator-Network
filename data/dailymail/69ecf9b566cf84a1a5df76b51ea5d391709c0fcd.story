The founder of the controversial Ground Zero Mosque allegedly spent more than $3 million that had been donated to charity to fund a first-class lifestyle that involved 'lavish trips, luxury sports cars and personal real estate.'

Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf was slapped with a $20 million lawsuit by, Robert Leslie Deak, a major backer to his nonprofit who alleges the wild spending in the papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Rauf's charity, the Cordoba Initiative, received $3 million from the Malaysian as well as another $167,000 from private donors. That money was meant to counter anti-Islamic sentiment but instead went to Rauf's private life, the lawsuit alleges.

Deak also claims that Rauf 'falsified' the nonprofit’s 'tax returns for 2008, 2009 and 2010 by failing to report receipt of funds from foreign sources and transfers of funds.'

Rauf's lawyer adamantly denied the allegations, the New York Post reported.

'He's going to vigorously defend them and show that it has no basis,' the lawyer, Paul Knight, said of his client.Rauf served as the Imam of the Ground Zero Mosque until being ousted in January 2011.

The mosque drew criticism from family members of those who died on 9/11 because it is just two blocks from the site of the terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000.

The mosque and community center opened in September 2011 but only after its developer admitted they should have done more to calm concerns of those who lost loved ones on 9/11.

The developer, Sharif El-Gamal, said he wanted a site where he could take his daughter for swimming lessons as well as learn about Islamic culture.

But he said they're good intent should have been mixed with more of a dialogue with the opposition.

'The biggest mistake we made was not 
to include 9/11 families,' he said at the time of the site's opening, noting that the advisory board 
includes at least one 9/11 family member.

'We didn't understand that we had a responsibility to discuss our private project with family members that lost loved ones.'
