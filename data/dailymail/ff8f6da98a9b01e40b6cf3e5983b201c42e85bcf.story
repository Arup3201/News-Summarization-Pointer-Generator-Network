Military-style cadet forces are to be introduced in every secondary school in Britain, it emerged today.

Education Secretary Michael Gove believes the Combined Cadet Force could bring a major improvement in standards of classroom discipline.

Today more than 200 independent schools, but only around 60 state, have CCF units, according to the Ministry of Defence, which sponsors the organisation.

Teenagers, aged 13 to 18, learn drill and are trained to fire weapons. Among its famous former members is Prince Harry, who was the most senior cadet in Eton's 140-strong volunteer force.

Mr Gove told the Sunday Express that the CCF would 'build patriotism' in the country’s troubled youngsters, giving them skills to succeed later in life.

He recently attended a cadet awards ceremony at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, where he met a 17-year-old Afro-Caribbean who had joined the CCF.

He said:'I met this amazing guy who told me how it had transformed his life. He was just the perfect advertisement for what it can do.

More than 300,000 pupils are suspended each year for violence and bad behaviour and police are called to violent incidents more than 40 times each day.

Mr Gove's move was backed by one of his senior advisers, Schools Commissioner Dr Elizabeth Sidwell, who is leading the expansion of the Government’s academy schools programme.

She said that many extra-curricular activities like the CCF, debating societies and music tuition should no longer be the 'province of the middle classes'.

Dr Sidwell told the Sunday Telegraph: 'These wonderful extra-curriculum elements did originate in the independent sector but for a number of years they have been there in City Technology Colleges, strong comprehensives and grammars.

'Good state schools have these things. We must not say we can’t afford it, we find a way.'

In other proposals, she signalled schools could face much tougher academic targets, with 80 per cent of 
children in state primaries and secondaries expected to reach 
required scores in exams and tests.

It would mean far more 
schools being classed as inadequate and subject to intervention from the
 Department of Education.

Meanwhile, Mr Gove wants children to learn history in class and be fluent in English.

He said: 'It’s important that the sorts of activities that build the sense of togetherness, whether it be sport or the combined cadet force or orchestras and choirs, are encouraged in schools and help people feel part of one country.'

The CCF was created in 1948 but its antecedents date back to 1859 when public schools and universities were asked to form volunteer corps.

It includes wings linked to the Army, Navy and RAF, and is made 
up of 13- to 18-year-olds.

It uses military- orientated training to 
build self-reliance, resourcefulness, endurance and a sense of service 
to the community.

In 2008, the then-prime minister Gordon Brown backed a government-commissioned report which said more state schools should sign up to CCF.

Although there has been no major rise, it is increasingly offered in academies.
