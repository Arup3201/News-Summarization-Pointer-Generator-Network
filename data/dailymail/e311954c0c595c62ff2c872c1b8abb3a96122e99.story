You may be wasting your time making home-made egg-nog and mince pies this Christmas.

Researchers have found the most memorable ingredient of a good spread is the company around the table.

The study has found that inviting good guests can make even make an everyday dinner transform into a feast, even if the food is quickly thrown together.

Researchers have found that a memorable meal does not automatically require sophisticated food

Lead author Dr Betina Piqueras-Fiszman said: ‘A memorable meal is not necessarily linked with sophisticated foods or elaborate events.

‘In fact, some meals were spontaneous or the foods very simple. However, it was often reported that, regardless of the type of food, the meal was really tasty.

‘This suggests that the rest of contextual factors might have contributed to make the food ‘taste’ very good, or at least to it being remembered as such.’

The researchers from Wageningen University in the Netherlands interviewed 886 people in Britain for an online survey.

Diners were asked to recall a memorable meal and to rate each aspect on a scale of one to seven.

The research, published in the journal Food Research International, found who you are with was rated the most important factor, followed closely by what you eat and drink.

The researchers found that simple food was more than enough if the invited guests were suitably entertaining

The atmosphere came third and the mood of the diner came in fourth.

The type of meal was fifth, followed by other activities taking place and then how often these memorable occasions take place.

Meals which are memorable for the occasion, such as Christmas dinners, weddings and birthdays, were excluded from the survey.

Dr Piqueras-Fiszman added: ‘Overall, the most important aspects of memorable meals were the company - who else was present during the memorable meal.

‘We would like to emphasise that memorable meals, as occasions that are often and positively remembered by consumers, seem to include a dimension related to emotions and overall well-being.

‘In this body of evidence, this component was reflected in the expressions used by the consumers and in the high importance ratings given to how they felt emotionally during that occasion.’
