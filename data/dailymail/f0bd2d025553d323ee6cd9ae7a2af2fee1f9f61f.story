Found: Authorities searched for 10-year-old Michael Joseph DelVecchio after he was reported missing

A 10-year-old boy who ran away from home on Sunday afternoon has been found safe.

Michael Joseph DelVecchio was seen walking near a Publix on Orange Blossom Trail on Monday morning by a motorist who recognized him from TV news bulletins.

The motorist pulled over to speak to the boy and called police, who reunited the youngster with his family.

'Michael was in good health, despite having spent the night in very cool temperatures,' the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

The boy, who goes by Mickey, was found a mile from his home on Crosshair Circle. 

He had last been seen there at around 4pm on Sunday and was believed to have run away, WKMG reported. 

The sheriff's office said Mickey was wearing athletic clothing and carrying a black and blue Scooby Doo backpack when he left. 

After he was reported missing, deputies, a bloodhound and a helicopter went searching for him, and the sheriff's office and other local departments put out pleas for information across social media and local news stations.

'There is concern for his well-being due to his age,' Cynthia Chavis, of the OCSO Missing Persons Unit, had said in statement before he was found. 

Last seen: He was last seen at his family's home, pictured, in Orlando, Florida at 4pm on Sunday but was spotted by a motorist around a mile from the house on Monday morning. He has been reunited with his family
