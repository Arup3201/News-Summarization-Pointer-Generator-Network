Understanding a killer: Lee Harvey Oswald was the suspected assassin but he was killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby before he could ever be put on trial

A young journalist had the run-in of his career on the day of President Kennedy's assassination but he didn't even know it.

Pierce Allman was a rookie reporter when he accidentally ran into Lee Harvey Oswald in the moments immediately after President Kennedy was shot.

'He didn't appear stressed in any way,' Allman said of Oswald.

Allman was in the crowd when shots were fired at the President's motorcade, and he saw people leaning out the fifth-floor windows of the Texas School Book Depository and looking up to the level above.

'There were three guys in the fifth floor window. And they were literally hanging out of the window and looking up and pointing up,' Allman told CBS.

'I thought, "I need to get to a phone and call." So I ran down the sidewalk and up the steps and into the doorway of the depository building.'

As soon as he got into the building, he realized that he needed help finding a phone in the building so he could file the report.

'There was a guy standing in the doorway, and I said, "Where's the phone?" And he jerked his thumb and said, "In there!" And I said, "Thank you,"â€™ he told CBS.

The moment was so fleeting that even though Oswald's picture was splashed across the papers and television news programs in the coming days, Allman did not realize that Oswald was the man he spoke to until three weeks later.

Then: Pierce Allman was a young reporter at the time of the assassination and as soon as he heard the gunshots he ran to the nearest phone to file the report

Now: Allman, seen looking at the Texas Book Depository, ran into that building because he thought he saw someone fire from the sixth floor, not knowing he actually bumped into that man on his way in

Looking back: At the time, nothing about Oswald's behavior concerned Allman

Allman was contacted by the Secret Service as they were combing through the police interviews Oswald had given before being shot on November 24.

'They said, "Are you familiar with the testimony of Lee Oswald after his arrest?" And I said, "No." And they said, "He states as he was leaving the depository building, a young man with a crew cut rushed up, identified himself as a newsman, and asked where a phone was. So this was very obviously you,"â€™ Allman said of his interaction with the agent. 

Another journalist with incredible timing was Maurice Carroll, who was working as a stringer in Dallas for The New York Herald-Tribune in the days following Kennedy's assassination.

Carroll was one of the reporters in the crowd waiting outside the basement of the Dallas police station, waiting as Oswald was being escorted for a transfer.

Today, Carroll reveals that he likely 
was the one to say the last words that the suspected assassin ever 
heard, saying: 'How about it, Lee?'

'There
 was no answer from Oswald as he was hustled forward by Detectives Jim 
Lavell and B.H. Combest to a sedan that was backing into position to 
pick him up,' Carroll writes, according to an article on Capital New 
York.

Final words: Fellow journalist Maurice Carroll said that he shouted out to Oswald saying 'How about it, Lee?' just seconds before Jack Ruby shot Oswald in the stomach

Fatal ride: President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie were in the back of the open-top convertible during their drive through Dallas on November 22, 1963

'Suddenly, a form flashed past UPI photographer Frank Johnston in the front row, Detective Combest, a vice squad member, recognized Ruby and saw Ruby pulling the .38 caliber from a jacket pocket.

'"Jack, you son of a bitch," the detective said.

'The slight smile on Oswald's face vanished and his mouth opened. There was a "pop" kind of sound, and a cry of anguish from Oswald as his manacled hands clutched at his abdomen. He slumped, but was supported by one of his guards before he could hit the ground.'
