These Chinese quadruplet schoolchildren have a real head for figures after their clever mother got individual numbers shaved into their hair so their teacher could easily tell them apart.

The six-year-old boys were beginning their first day of school in Shenzhen city in south China's Guangdong province, earlier this week and one can only imagine how relieved their teachers felt.

The quadruplets, whose names are 
Jiang Yunlong, Jiang Yunxiao, Jiang Yunhan and Jiang Yunlin from eldest 
to youngest, are so similar even their father finds it hard to tell them apart.

Heads up: The parents of these four identical Chinese quadruplets have resorted to shaving numbers into their sons' hair to tell them apart

Their parents are not rich but are 
keen for their boys to get a full education and the brothers are 
studying traditional and ancient Chinese 
cultures and are learning Latin dance.

They certainly got a head start in mathematics.

Head start: The quadruplets, whose names are Jiang Yunlong, Jiang Yunxiao, Jiang Yunhan and Jiang Yunlin, tuck into a hearty breakfast before setting off to their first day at school

Hair we go: Mother Tan Chaoyun leads her adorable brood to school. She admitted that even their father at times felt confused when dealing with them
