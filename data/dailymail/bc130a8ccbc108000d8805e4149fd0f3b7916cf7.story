Two men who burned down a 400-year-old wedding venue causing £5million worth of damage have been jailed.

Disgruntled ex-employee Thomas Richardson, 27, and his 'vulnerable' accomplice Mark Hall, 28, torched a barn at Chilford Hall in Linton, Cambridgeshire, in June last year.

Fuelled by alcohol, the pair started a blaze in a 'cruel and calculated attack', destroying the 18th century barn and forcing the cancellation or postponement of more than 100 weddings, Cambridge Crown Court heard.

It led to members of staff being made redundant and had a knock-on effect on local businesses which relied on the venue for custom.

Prosecutor Christopher Morgan said: 'The loss of these buildings and personal items was irreplaceable. It also had a widespread impact on the local economy.'

Richardson had been sacked by the venue for stealing alcohol exactly three years before the blaze and had long held a grudge.

He had driven autistic Hall to the barn and encouraged him to take part in the arson attack, jurors were told during their trial.

Earlier in the evening Richardson told his girlfriend of his plan. She called the fire service to warn them but it was treated as a hoax call.

Police found Richardson and Hall after the blaze with bin bags containing several bottles of empty spirits and white tissues soaked in alcohol in a car.

Richardson, 27, admitted arson while Hall, 28, was found guilty by a jury after a trial.

Both of the men from Haverhill, Suffolk, were cleared of the more serious charge of being reckless as to whether life was endangered.

Widespread impact: The court heard how the closure of Chilford Hall had a major impact on the local economy

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth jailed Richardson for five years and four months and Hall for four years.

He said: 'Chilford Hall was a family business and a much loved asset within the East Anglia community.

'The
fire started in the dead of night when the venue was deserted but the 
owner, Fiona Alper, and her son were asleep a matter of yards away.

'It was only the bravery and dedication of the fire service which prevented damage to their home and danger to them.

'The fire burnt fiercely all night and it wasn't until the next morning that it was fully controlled.'

He added that Mrs Alper's husband had died in 2002. Before that he had dedicated himself to building up the business.

'One can barely grasp the trauma you have caused to Mrs Alper and her son in watching his work go up in smoke," the judge said.

'This
fire, deliberately set as it was, was a cruel and calculated attack not
only on the Alpers and their employees but the community as a whole.'

Mr
Morgan told the court that, as one of the main attractions in a small 
village, the fire had a major effect on local businesses.

The
year before the fire, the barn spent £539,000 with suppliers, with one 
butcher estimating 30% of its income came from the venue.

An extensive art collection, built up by Mrs Alper's late husband, Sam, was also destroyed.

Adam Budworth, mitigating, said Richardson offered his 'sincerest apologies for such disgraceful behaviour'.

He added: 'Whoever started the blaze, there is only one person responsible for burning down the barn and this is Mr Richardson'.

Mark Shelley, mitigating on behalf of Hall, said his client had autism and very low IQ.

Mr
Shelley added: 'He was not a main mover. He was heavily in drink and 
was led by Mr Richardson into going along to the hall and doing what he 
did.'

Trauma: Owner Mrs Alper and her son had to watch the venue burn to the ground

Damage: An extensive art collection built up by owner Mrs Alper's late husband was also destroyed in the blaze

Speaking after the sentencing, Mrs Alper told the Cambridge News: 'Nothing can change what has happened and the huge loss we have suffered.

'We have been deeply touched by the overwhelming support from the 
public. Since the fire we have been working hard to re-establish our 
core business and are now looking forward to a bright new future for 
Chilford Hall.'

Det Con Tracey Griffin, who led the police investigation, said: 'This was a revenge attack by an ex-employee and his accomplice which caused a considerable amount of damage, not to mention the heartache this caused couples who were due to get married at the wedding venue.

'When officers arrived the fire was well lit and the Alper family were still asleep in their beds. The officers woke the family and moved them to a place of safety until firefighters arrived to fight the blaze.

'The fire not only put officers and fire officers in danger but has also had a detrimental effect on the local community and local businesses.

'Thankfully no-one was hurt and I hope today's result sends out a strong message to others of the serious consequences of arson.'
