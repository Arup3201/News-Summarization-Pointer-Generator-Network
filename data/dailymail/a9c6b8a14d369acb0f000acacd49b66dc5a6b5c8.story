'Prince George' hopped up the corridor of his palatial enclosure, clambered over a rock and went straight for a bowl writhing with his favourite meal of maggots, live worms, fly eggs and chopped fruit, drizzled with sunflower oil.

'He's a good man, his lordship' said senior Australian Fauna keeper at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, Paul Davies, 'I'm very proud of him, although he is being a bit of a pig,' Davies said as 'Prince George', a mature male Australian bilby, hoed into the worms.

Davies, who is originally from Hertford, UK, and trained at London Zoo, is preparing the bilby, an endangered Australian marsupial, for the forthcoming visit to the Sydney harbourside zoo by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Paul Davies, inside the nocturnal animal enclosure with 'Prince George', the bilby 'adopted' by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's eight-month-old son, has created a special setting of sand and rocks to emulate the desert environment in which the threatened species is found in the wild

The Palace has accepted Australia's offer to name the bilby enclosure after Prince George, and the Australian government's gift of a bilby for the young prince to 'adopt'.

Taronga Zoo , which is 'incredibly proud to be part of Australia's gift to Prince George' sees the royal visit as 'a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about Australia’s unique native animals, especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild'.

Inside the nocturnal house at Taronga, where Mr Davies also works with possums, bats, gliders, rodents, owls and lizards, 'Prince George' is part of the zoo's breeding programme to increase bilby populations, which launched last year with an Australian government donation after the royal heir's birth in July.

'We tried everything with three other male bilbies, but they were too old, one of them had a bit of a limp,' said Mr Davies, who came to Australia in 1981 after working as a keeper at London Zoo and Edinburgh Zoo.

'Then we got his lordship here,' he pointed at 'Prince George', 'although there was a problem at the start.'

Sydney's famous Taronga Zoo says it is 'incredibly proud to be part of Australia's gift to Prince George' and sees the royal visit by the Duke and Duchess of Camridge next month as 'a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about Australia's unique native animals, especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild'

Prince George, the Australian bilby who has been 'adopted' by young royal heir Prince George has been introduced to a young female bilby on Taronga Zoo's breeding programme, but has 'been quite the gentleman to date' says his keeper, Paul Davies

Endangered Australian marsupial, 'Prince George' inside Sydney's Taronga Zoo nocturnal enclosure sniffs at the hand of his keeper, British born Paul Davies, who says he has high hopes of the animal producing bilbies in the future, following next month's visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son, Prince George

'Last year we put him with a female called Kirra and we tried everything, but they didn't reproduce, so we asked for a young female.

'Her name's Yajala, it means friend [in an Aboriginal language]. She's down there. That's why he keeps on taking off. She might be coming into season.

'He's sniffing at her door, although I must say 'Prince George' has been quite the gentleman to date.'

As the bilby scampered away down the corridor to linger outside the darkened enclosure where the new young female bilby is 'settling in' to life at Taronga, Mr Davies explained why he had become so passionate since emigrating to Australia about a native animal most Australians had never seen.

Mr Davies, who lives in Sydney with his French-born wife, Delphine, and their 13-year-old son, who is also mad about bilbies, said he had started working at Taronga a year after arriving in Australia.

'I got my first job working on a horse stud in Queensland and when I showed them my diploma of zoo keeping from London, they just said 'put that away you Pommie bastard, we don't need to see it' and so I just worked with the horses on the farm and it was great.

'I started at Taronga and then in the nocturnal house and I just got to love bilbies. They are the most amazing little animals.

'See those ears? They're like sophisticated  air conditioning systems to help them survive in the desert, where it's hot during the day and freezing at night.

'When it’s hot, the bilbies keep their ears erect. The ears are hairless and rapidly cool the little creatures. When it’s cold, they let their ears fall against their head, almost like a little helmet, to conserve heat.

'We’ve also found they can run very quickly and when they do, the hold their white-tipped tails forwards over their heads, like a little lamp lighting their way.

'We’re getting amazing reactions from people.'

Ordinary Australians will be allowed in to Taronga Zoo (above) on Easter Sunday, when the royal couple - and, perhaps Prince George - visit the bilby, enlcosure and see tree kangaroos, giraffes and birds of prey

Once he learned how fast the bilbies can move, Mr Davies set up what he jokingly calls 'the running of the bilbies', a display for visitors in which bilbies like 'Prince George' run up the corridor to a special setting of fake rocks, sand and tree stumps he has assembled between walls painted in Aboriginal colours and with the different tribal names for the creature.

'Bilbies once thrived across 70 per cent of Australia,' he said.

'These days most bilby populations are on Aboriginal land in the deserts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia.

'Elsewhere they've had to compete with rabbits, feral cats and populations have declined, so we have high hopes for his lordship and our breeding programme.'

It is not confirmed whether young Prince George will accompany his parents to Taronga Zoo on Easter Sunday, when the Duke and Duchess will start at the bilby enclosure, move on to feeding sessions in the tree kangaroo and giraffe enclosures, and then watch the birds of prey and other animals.

'I like the challenge of a close encounter as with animals,' Mr Davies said, 'if you get people close to an animal, you can make them aware about conservation and that is very important with our bilbies.'

Mr Davies, who still has family back in Hertfordshire, says he is very happy he moved to sunny Australia but he now spends so much time in the nocturnal enclosure he has to take Vitamin D tablets to regulate his system.

'But I love my work,' he said, 'and I love getting people excited about wildlife.'

Taronga director, Cameron Kerr said the zoo was part of 'a national breeding program across a number of Australian zoos and wildlife organisations that are involved in conservation, breeding and research to provide an insurance population to safeguard' bilbies into the future.

'We look forward to introducing Their Royal Highnesses to our bilbies in April,' he said.
