Officials in a Texas  are ordering the operator of an alleged swinger's club to shut it down.

Arlington officials sent a letter Wednesday to the owners of a North Cooper Street home demanding them to stop throwing weekly lavish, erotic parties, accusing them of illegally operating a home-based business, the Star-Telegram reports.

Since May, David Esopenko has been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood. 

The address is described online as a new and exciting 'lifestyle venue,' according to its website.

Letter: Arlington officials sent a letter Wednesday to the owners of a North Cooper Street home (photographed) demanding them to stop throwing weekly lavish, erotic parties, accusing them of illegally operating a home-based business

Parties: Since May, David Esopenko (right)  has been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood

Esopenko leases the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, according to the Telegram, and has reportedly had nearly 60 of the erotic parties -- some with themes.

The city began investigating Eutopia after receiving complaints from neighbors about noise, weekend traffic, and Esopenko paving over the property's lawn to accommodate up to 70 vehicles at a time.

'This is a sexually-oriented swingers' club in my neighborhood,' Jon Vecchio, a neighbor, told USA Today. 'We don't want it here.'

While some of the neighborhood's residents question the morality of the establishment that offers  food, drinks, and condoms, city officials say it's a zoning issue.

'This isn't a morality issue for us, though. We're looking at this specific residence,' Jay Warren, an Arlington spokesman, told FOX. 

'It is a residence. It is a home. It should be used as that and not a business to the extent we found there at that residence.'

Features: The three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area

The city holds that Eutopia is a business operating out of a single-family home because of its regular hours of operation (each weekend from 8.30pm to 3am), its promotional advertising, and its services which  include a valet for the guests and sometimes laundry service, according to the Arlington Voice. 

According to the Telegram, the three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area. 

The voice reports that police sent undercover officers to investigate the alleged 'sex club' after receiving multiple complaints last summer but the officers reported no illegal activity going on in the residence.

The home, leased to Esopenko by its owner James Self, is completely furnished, but no one lives there, according to USA Today.

Favorite: Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play'

Friends: Esopenko holds that he is simply throwing parties for his close friends

In the letter sent to Esopenko and Self, city officials spoke of the home-based business guidelines, which require the owner of the business to live in the home, the Voice reports.

The letter also claims that the parties are the primary use for the house, and not secondary to the single-family home unit.

Esopenko told WFAA that Eutopia is not a swinger's club because he does not charge guests, instead the party-goers may make donations: $80 for couples, $20 for single women, and $80 for single men.

The city holds that these donations rake in thousands of dollars a night for Eutopia, however, Esopenko says none of the money is pocketed, rather used for snacks and drink set up.

'The average person that comes is a nurse, teacher, fireman, policeman, judge, former Arlington city councilman,' Esopenko told the Telegram.

'These are people who don't like to go to normal clubs to hang out because they are too dark, too loud.'

And the 'lifestyle venue' has received positive reviews on swinger sites like Swinger Date Club.

Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play.'

Other reviewers have described Eutopia as a 'clean, beautiful home full of sexy, smart people,' the Telegram reports.

One reviewer wrote: 'The only drawback I've found is the mattresses are a little hard, but that won't stop me from having fun there.' 

An online advertisement indicates that the next party will be a Super Bowl pre-party called 'Jersey Night' held Saturday. 

Esopenko holds that he is simply throwing parties for his close friends, and the property's owner, Self, told the Telegram that he plans to sell the house to Esopenko saying his friend pays his rent on time each month.

Self said that the media coverage on Eutopia has led to phone calls from his friends, asking if he's running a sex club.

'When you rent a property, you do what you want to with it,' Self told the Telegram. 'I've been to one of his parties. It is drug-free. You don't leave drunk. He's very, very strict on everything. It was a well-run, very classy adult party.'

City officials say the magnitude of the operations, combined with complaints illustrates the negative impact Eutopia has on the neighborhood.

Eutopia has been cited twice for parking violations and the amount of vehicles parked at one time may prove to be a hazard as cars stack up on the right-hand lane of the street, the Voice reports. 

Esopenko said what the city is doing is bullying him to shut Eutopia down, according to the Telegram.

'This is intimidation by the city thinking we'll go, 'Oh, my, we're embarrassed.' We are not embarrassed about what we are doing,' Esopenko said.

The city is giving Esopenko ten days to make an action on the order. He says he plans to appeal.
