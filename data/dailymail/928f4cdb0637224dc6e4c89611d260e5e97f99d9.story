Robbery suspect: Smiling wannabe comedian Jeffrey Lluis

Aspiring stand-up comedian Jeffrey Lluis once cracked jokes about committing crimes in a YouTube video.

But it was no laughing matter when he allegedly carried out the gag in real life by robbing the same Florida bank TWICE in a week.

Lluis, 27, implied he would 'blow the bank up' unless he was given cash by the teller at the  SunTrust branch in Citrus Park, Tampa, say police

Then two days later, wearing the same hat and dark glasses, he said to startled staff: 'It's me again.'

However, police had the last laugh when he was held after two bank employees picked him out from a line up of suspects.

'They (bank staff) recognized him before he even 
announced the robbery,' Captain Andy Ross said. 'I wouldn't think he's 
thinking it's very funny right now.'

A detective quizzed Lluis about the first raid when investigators noticed a strong resemblance between him and the suspect after they reviewed a surveillance tape.

But Lluis, who was on probation for cocaine possession, robbery and two counts of uttering a forged instrument, wasn't arrested. The next day the SunTrust Bank was hit again.

Raided: The SunTrust Bank in Citrus Park, Tampa, which was hit twice in a week

But police claim a witness saw the suspect fleeing in a car and was able to provide enough information to once again lead detectives to Lluis.Â 

He was arrested on two counts of robbery and also several violations of his probation.

In a 2009 comedy show which was posted on YouTube, Lluis did not keep his convictions a secret.

'I just lost my job recently,' he told the crowd. 'As you can tell things got kind of complicated around the office after detectives came in and picked me up.'

He performed several times at Side Splitters on open mic nights. The comedy club plans to permanently draw their curtain on Lluis.

Side Splitters Manager Brian Thompson said: 'It's tough to tell if they're telling the truth or not in their jokes. Obviously we don't support anything like that.'
