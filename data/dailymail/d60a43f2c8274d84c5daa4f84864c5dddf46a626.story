Chip shop boss John Clarkson has paid an 'up-North' homage to his favourite chocolate by creating the world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter. 

Mr Clarkson, 54, made the giant 11lbs version of the hazelnut sweet made famous in the 'ambassador's party' TV advert - but gave it an extra twist using his own recipe.

It is ten times the usual size of a Ferrero Rocher and even comes complete with a giant paper Ferrero Rocher tray.

It will go on display at his Mister Eater's Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire.

Mr Clarkson came up with the idea after an initial batch of normal-sized Ferrero Rochers dipped in batter proved to be a surprise hit with customers.

Corinne Clarkson, 39, who co-owns the chip shop with Mr Clarkson said: 'They love it - it draws a bit of a chuckle but some people have tried scraps of the mixture and they have said it's delicious.

'I don't even want to know how many calories are in it but it's something I wouldn't recommend eating alone.'

Wacky: Mr Clarkson began battering normal Ferrero Rochers before he decided to make the world's biggest

Mr Clarkson added: 'We have to keep 
thinking of new things all the time to keep new people coming in. Now 
with the things we have done in the past new customers expect it. 

'Everyone wants to know what we are going to do next.

'It's
 hard for me to keep coming up with ideas but we are constantly 
thinking. We did the Ferrero Rochers at Christmas and it was absolutely 
fantastic.

'We got on the 
radio and they were talking about them on the Alan Titchmarsh show. So I
 thought I needed to go one step further.

'We like to do things no-one has ever done before. We make our own Ferrero Rochers now so we thought we would make the world's biggest. We have researched and no-one has done it. I can't tell you our chocolate recipe though, it's a secret. 

'As with everything, it's the bigger the better. I always have people coming in asking what I'm doing next. I like to surprise people so they ask how I've done it.

Fattening: John Clarkson holds up his giant Ferrero Rocher at his chip shop in Lancashire

'Nobody else in our trade does anything like this. We did a romantic meal for two for Valentine's Day.'It had a deep-fried sausage candelabra which worked and deep fried chili con carne and steak pudding with gravy.'

Mr Clarkson is known for his wacky creations after also making the world's longest battered sausage and raising money for the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer by encouraging women to bring their bras to his shop to be filled with chips. 

He joked that cup sizes A-B warrant a small chip portion, B-C are medium and D upwards are a large.Mr Clarkson, who has ran the takeaway for 25 years, started to come up with quirky ideas after the shop was visited by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal in 2012 as part of his eccentric Channel 4 cooking series Fantastical Food. 

Ferrero Rocher was first introduced in 1982 and consists of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut cream including vegetable oil and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts.

They became popular in the 1990s for their often-imitated 'ambassador's party' TV adverts where a mountain of Ferrero Rochers became synonymous with wealthy gatherings.

Before Christmas Mr Clarkson offered customers deep fried Mince Pies over the festive period.
