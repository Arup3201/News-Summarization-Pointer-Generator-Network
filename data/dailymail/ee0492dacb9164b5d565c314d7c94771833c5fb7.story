Stepping down: Richard Brasher has quit after just one year in the job

The head of Tesco’s UK business will step down later this year as he pays the price for a disastrous winter.

Richard Brasher, a long-serving director, took on the role last March but oversaw the supermarket’s worst Christmas trading performance for many years.

His position will be taken on by group chief executive Philip Clarke, who has pledged a much closer involvement in the UK business.

There were reports of tensions between the two men after its Big Price Drop campaign flopped, prompting a near £5 billion slump in its market value.

Mr Clarke told Reuters that Mr Brasher recognised 'you can’t have two captains in a team.'

He added: 'This greater focus will allow me to oversee the improvements that are so important for customers.'

Tesco said Mr Brasher will leave the business in July once he has overseen the handover of responsibilities to Mr Clarke.

He will leave behind a UK business which has very strong plans for improvement, and over the last two months these plans are beginning to show progress, in line with our expectations,' Mr Clarke added.

Mr Clarke has already revealed he plans to cram a three-year overhaul into the next 12 months, including a raft of initiatives dealing with online, price and home delivery.

Mr Brasher was appointed to the board eight years ago, having joined Tesco in 1986. He has held a number of marketing, commercial and store operations positions, before being appointed UK and Ireland boss in March 2011.

Tesco’s share of the sector has 
slipped from 30.3 per cent a year ago to 29.7 per cent in the 12 weeks to February 19, a
level last seen in May 2005.

The supermarket, Britain’s biggest 
retailer, has announced plans to open new stores and create 20,000 jobs 
over the next two years as it battles back from its first profit warning
in living memory.

It recently declared it was planning a
shake-up that would see ranges and price discounts  tailored to the 
incomes of local families.

The strategy – spearheaded by Mr 
Brasher – was designed to breathe life into UK sales after a disastrous 
fall in Christmas takings.

Mr Brasher, who is Chief Executive of UK Operations, was also the man behind Tesco’s ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for

The supermarket launched its price drop campaign on September 27, just days before announcing their worst sales figures in 20 years. They fell by almost 1 per cent as customers bought less food, switched to budget rivals and turned away from luxury purchases.

The ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which promised annual savings worth £500million, was part of an attempt by Tesco to be recast as a champion of low prices.

However customers, who continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase, were not convinced.

Tesco was also censured by advertising watchdogs over a price comparison campaign in which the supermarket giant claimed to be so confident it was cheaper than Asda and other rivals, that it would refund double the difference on any basket of groceries.

At Christmas, Tesco offered a half-price frozen turkey in an attempt to rival other supermarkets. But it was later discovered competitors were selling their own frozen turkeys for around the same price – without the supposed 50 per cent discount.

Former group chief executive Sir Terry 
Leahy led the chain for more than 13 years and oversaw its rise to 
become the UK’s leading supermarket.

During his time in charge, he took its annual pre-tax profits from £750million to more than £3billion,

But Tesco’s performance in the UK started to falter in the last years of his tenure and has continued to lag behind its main competitors in recent months.

Underlying sales in the crucial Christmas trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent, bringing warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as expected and wiping almost £5billion off the share price.

Mr Brasher was appointed to the board eight years ago, having joined Tesco in 1986. He has held a number of marketing, commercial and store operations positions, before being appointed UK and Ireland boss in March 2011.

Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said it was not a good sign for the business when the chief executive has to 'micro manage' the UK operation.

He added: 'Given the rumoured tensions between the two of them over the scale of the price cuts in the Price Drop, Mr Clarke ultimately had to back Mr Brasher or sack him, but the cracks are showing and it is hard to see how this will end happily.'

While Tesco shares were 1 per cent lower today, Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan kept his buy rating and said he believed the UK business will recover.

He added: 'Having a group chief executive and a chief executive of the UK is all very well when things are going swimmingly.

'However, with the UK 70 per cent of the business and underperforming, it becomes difficult to have two captains on the bridge. Therefore, the departure of Richard Brasher is a sad, but perhaps inevitable, consequence of the recent profit warning.'
