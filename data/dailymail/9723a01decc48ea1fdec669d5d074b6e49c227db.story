The young lover of France's under-fire Socialist finance minister has leapt to his defence as his government's tax dodging scandal intensifies.

In an often hilarious interview with her local paper, Marie-Charline Pacquot, 25, describes herself as 57-year-old Pierre Moscovici's 'lighthouse in a storm'.

She not only lashes out at his critics, but - in an attempt to prove how modest they are - describes quiet nights in 'watching westerns' with their cat, 'Hamlet'.

Miss Pacquot's words provide a fascinating insight into the influence France's notoriously amorous male politicians have with their frequently much younger girlfriends.

Many have accused Mr Moscovici's left-wing government of utter hypocrisy, especially since budget minister, Jerome Cahuzac, was charged with tax evasion last week.

Mr Moscovici is now accused of having known about Cahuzac's secret Swiss account since December - a claim he denies.

Miss Pacquot, who was a philosophy student when she first started going out with the minister around five years ago and is now a researcher, told Le Pays (The Country) that attacks on politicians like Mr Moscovici were unwarranted.

'It is hard that he becomes a victim when there is a crisis like this,' she said.

'I see how he suffers by proxy.

'I am also terribly surprised by the number of lies that are told about him, and it breaks my heart.

'But at times like this it is important to be together. He has often told me that I am a lighthouse in the storm.'

Miss Pacquot says she has 'always liked being surrounded by older people' adding that she 'pays no attention' to the age gap, unless he mentions attending a rock concert by The Who 'in 1972'.

She says the couple lead a 'normal 
life' - 'going to a restaurant or watching old westerns on DVD with our 
cat Hamlet on our knees'.

Francois
Hollande, France's president, has a live-in lover, Valerie Trierweiler,
who is more than a decade younger than him, while his predecessor, 
Nicolas Sarkozy, married his lover, former supermodel Carla Bruni, while
in office.

Both Miss Trierweiler and Miss Bruni, who still uses her maiden name in her career as a pop singer, have frequently been criticised for commenting on their partner's politics.

Mr Hollande, who wants to introduce a tax rate of income tax of 75 per cent, has pledged widescale reform following Cahuzac being placed under formal judicial investigation.

Many high-profile business leaders have left France since Mr Hollande's government came to power last year, and the economy is in crisis, with both unemployment and the cost of living spiralling.
