More than 700 inmates on Death Row in California could have their sentences converted to life in prison without parole if state voters decide to abolish the death penalty.

California will soon get the chance to decide whether to replace the death penalty with a no-parole life sentence, after it was decided a measure to abolish capital punishment now qualified for a ballot in November, Secretary of State Debra Bowen said.

If it passes, it would mean the sentence of life without parole would be the harshest penalty prosecutors could seek and all 725 inmates on Death Row could have their sentences converted.

Should California abolish the death penalty?

Backers of the measure say abolishing 
the death penalty will save the state millions of dollars through 
layoffs of prosecutors and defense attorneys who handle death penalty 
cases, as well as savings from not having to maintain the nation's 
largest death row at San Quentin State Prison.

Those savings, supporters argue, can 
be used to help unsolved crimes. If the measure passes, $100 million in 
purported savings from abolishing the death penalty would be used over 
three years to investigate unsolved murders and rapes.

The
measure is dubbed the 'Savings, Accountability, and Full Enforcement 
for California Act,' also known as the SAFE California Act. It's the 
fifth measure to qualify for the November ballot, the secretary of state
announced on Monday. Supporters collected more than the 504,760 valid 
signatures needed to place the measure on the ballot.

Jeanne Woodford, the former
warden of San Quentin who is now an anti-death penalty advocate and an 
official supporter of the measure, said: 'Our system is broken, 
expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake.'

The measure will also require most 
inmates sentenced to life without parole to find jobs within prisons. 
Most death row inmates do not hold prison jobs for security reasons.

Though
California is one of 35 states that still authorises the death penalty,
the state hasn't put anyone to death since 2006. A federal judge that 
year halted executions until prison officials built a new death chamber 
at San Quentin, developed new lethal injection protocols and made other 
improvements to delivering the lethal three-drug combination.

A separate state lawsuit is challenging the way the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation developed the new protocols. A judge in Marin County earlier this year ordered the CDCR to redraft its lethal injection protocols, further delaying executions.

Since California reinstated the death penalty in 1978, the state has executed 13 inmates. A 2009 study conducted by a senior federal judge and law school professor concluded that the state was spending about $184 million a year to maintain Death Row and the death penalty system.

The last inmates to be executed in California were at San Quentin. Clarence Ray Allen was executed in January 2006 for the murder of three people. Donald Beardslee was executed a year earlier for the murder of two people during a drug deal.

Supporters of the proposition, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, are portraying it as a cost-savings measure in a time of political austerity. They count several prominent conservatives and prosecutors - including the author of the 1978 measure adopting the death penalty - as supporters and argue that too few executions have been carried out at too great a cost.

expensive and it always will carry the grave risk of a mistake'

'My conclusion is that he law is totally ineffective,' said Gil Garcetti, a former Los Angeles County district attorney. 'Most inmates are going to die of natural causes, not executions.'

Garcetti, who served as district attorney from 1992 to 2000, said he changed his mind after publication of the 2009 study, which was published by Judge Arthur Alarcon of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and law professor Paula Mitchell.

Opponents of the measure, such as former Sacramento U.S Attorney McGregor Scott, argue that lawyers filing 'frivolous appeals' are the problem, not the death penalty law.

'On behalf of crime victims and their loved ones who have suffered at the hands of California's most violent criminals, we are disappointed that the ACLU and their allies would seek to score political points in their continued efforts to override the will of the people and repeal the death penalty,' said Scott, who is chairman of the Californians for Justice and Public Safety, a coalition of law enforcement officials, crime victims and others formed to oppose the measure.

The Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, meanwhile, remains one the biggest backers of the death penalty in the state and opposes the latest attempt to abolish it in California. The foundation and its supports argue that federal judges are gumming up the process with endless delays and reversals of state Supreme Court rulings upholding individual death sentences.

The foundation on Thursday filed a lawsuit seeking the immediate resumption of executions in California. The foundation's lawsuit, filed directly with the state Court of Appeal, argues that since the three-drug method has been the subject of so much litigation - and the source of the execution delays - a one-drug method of lethal injection like Ohio uses can be substituted immediately.
