One of Sydney’s prestigious suburbs has listed a rare property on the market, with a price tag that will set you back seven digits – but it’s completely unliveable.

Located in Sydney’s most affluent suburb of Mosman, the three bedroom home features a study room, separate living and dining rooms, one bathroom and gas kitchen.

It is one of the original homes in Mosman and an increasingly rare opportunity with many properties that are not on offer as much potential as this dilapidated freestanding cottage.

Located at 22 Calliope Street, Mosman - the property is asking from $1,000,000

The property is tucked away in a cul-de-sac street, surrounded in a child-friendly reserve with close proximity and walking distance to shops, harbour parks, schools, transport and Mosman Bay ferry.

Experts believe the property is a perfect opportunity for new home owners, renovators or developers and will require an extensive overhaul and upgrade for a tremendous scope to capitalise.

Set on a prized corner block of Royalist Road with a 13 metre frontage of a picturesque setting and perfect sunny facing the rear yard of the 368 square metre block of land.

The property is listed on the market for the very first time in 80 years and offers a blank canvas and unlimited scope to recreate.
