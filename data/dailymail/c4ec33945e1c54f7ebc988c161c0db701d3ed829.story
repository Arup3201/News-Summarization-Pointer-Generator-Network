Police had to get physical with a number of Black Friday shoppers who refused to let go of discounted Samsung televisions during a fight at a Walmart in Texas.

Cell phone footage of the brawl has gone viral after it was posted on YouTube and shows authorities having to forcibly remove shoppers who were lying on top of the giant 50 inch TVs.

On sale for $218, the televisions were part of the Stafford store's One Hour Guarantee Promotion on Thanksgiving.

Once the giveaway began customers rushed the display and started grabbing the televisions.

Several people got heated as the number of TVs began to dwindle, said police.

Witnesses said people tried to claim the items by lying on top of them and wrestling each other off. It got so rough that police had to jump in to sort things out.

Stafford police said law enforcement in the video were off-duty police and sheriff's deputies hired to provide extra security for Walmart.

In the end, no was hurt and no one was arrested.

Ironically the One Hour Guarantee Promotion ensured that even if the store ran out of the item, it would be shipped to the customer's store for them to collect before Christmas.

'It doesn't surprise me. The way people are acting to save money and you can't blame them. They are just trying to save some money,' shopper Lorranie Henderson told Click2Houston.

Early discounting, more online shopping and a mixed economy meant fewer people shopped over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Retail Federation said on Sunday.

Overall, 133.7 million people shopped in stores and online over the four-day weekend, down 5.2 percent from last year, according to a survey of 4,631 people conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics for the trade group.

Total spending for the weekend is expected to fall 11 percent to $50.9 billion from an estimated $57.4 billion last year, the trade group estimated. 

Part of the reason is that Target, J.C. Penney, Macy's, Walmart and other major retailers pushed fat discounts as early as Halloween. Some opened stores even earlier on Thanksgiving. All that stole some thunder from Black Friday and the rest of the weekend.

Crazy: Discount store shoppers were prepared to wait in long lines on Black Friday - but the decision of many retailers to open on Thanksgiving has affected the sales figures for the busiest shopping day of the year

Still, the preliminary data makes retailers worried that shoppers remain frugal despite improving employment and falling gas prices.

Matt Shay, the trade group's CEO, said he thinks people benefiting from the recovery may not feel the need to fight crowds to get the deepest discount on a TV or toaster. And those who feel like the recession never ended may not have the money and will stretch out what they spend through Christmas.

And shoppers are still feeling the effects of high food prices and stagnant wages.

'While they're more optimistic, they're very cautious,' Shay said. 'If the deals are not right for them, they're not going to spend.'

Bottom line: Expect more deep discounts, all season long.

'Every day will be Black Friday. Every minute will be Cyber Monday,' he said.
