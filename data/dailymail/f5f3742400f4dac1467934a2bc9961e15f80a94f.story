Weaker beer: AB InBev are dropping the alcohol volume in their popular lagers to combat the cost of duty

Lager drinkers are in for a shock after brewing giant AB InBev decided to cut the alcohol volume in Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's, according to The Grocer.

The shake-up of the three top brands should save millions of pounds that will offset duty hikes and cost increases, the trade magazine says.

The world's largest brewer is cutting the alcohol volume of the popular beers from 5per cent to 4.8per cent.

The company, which unveiled price hikes across its drinks portfolio last year, will shift the beers to the lower abv at the end of this month.

The Grocer said yesterday that the brewer would not give reasons for the reduction but confirmed that only beer sold in the UK was affected.

An AB InBev spokeswoman told the magazine: 'Our decision to bring Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's to the UK market at 4.8per cent abv during 2012 is in line with evolving UK category trends.'

Last October, AB InBev said that rising raw material and energy costs would force it to pass on a 7.8 per cent price increase across all its brands from 2 January - a strategy being pursued by other brewers.

But industry insiders say that some retailers had rejected demands for price increases and producers were cutting abv to offset costs, retain price points and shore up profitability.

One industry source told The Grocer: 'Some of the major multiples have denied price increases for three years and the brewers' answer is to shift into smaller bottles and move from 5per cent to 4.8per cent.'

Hannah Stoddell from The Grocer said most Stella drinkers wouldn't bat an eyelid as long as the taste doesn't change

Cutting Stella Artois' abv by 0.2per cent would save AB InBev an estimated £8.6million a year in duty based on its off-trade sales alone according to market researchers Nielsen.

But Tim Wilson, managing director of market analysts Wilson Drinks Report, said that it would need to persuade big customers that there was something in it for them too, with money being invested back into the brand.

Hannah Stodell, senior reporter of The Grocer said: 'Let's be clear. This is not about Stella's 'wifebeater' tag. With brewers struggling with duty hikes and cost increases, something had to give.

'For AB InBev, the decision to cut the strength of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's is certainly timely - coming in the week the All-Party Parliamentatry Beer Group raised a glass to lower-alcohol beers and their contribution to responsible drinking.

'But while AB InBev points to 'evolving trends' towards lower-strength beer, the £8.6 million off-trade annual saving on Stella alone is a nudge in its own right for new boss Inge Plochaet, particularly in light of the £11.6 million decline in Stella sales last year.

'The reduction might put a few punters off but the majority probably won't bat an eyelid as long as the 4.8per cent brews deliver on taste.'
