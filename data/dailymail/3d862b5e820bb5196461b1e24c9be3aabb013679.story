Finding: Being able to hear the tick-tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children, according to a new U.S. study

It is often said that women have an internal biological clock.

But it seems the mere sound of the seconds ticking away can make them focus more on their fertility.

A study found that being able to hear the tick-tock of a clock makes women quicken their desire to marry and have children. 

The subtle reminder that their 
fertility is finite may also lead to them lowering their expectations 
and settling for what they perceive to be a less successful man.

Researchers said that the idea that a woman’s urge and ability to 
have a child are controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained

As such, females may unconsciously associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away.

The U.S. researchers completed two experiments to test the influence of the ticking of a small clock on men and women’s reproductive attitudes.

In the first, 59 men and women were asked questions about the age at which they would like to marry and start a family.

In the second experiment, they were quizzed on the qualities they look for in husband or wife.

They were also asked about how financially secure their childhood was.

Those women whose parents were poor were influenced by the ticking sound.

The tick-tock led to them wanting to have children earlier and to place less emphasis on a man’s social status and earning power.

While it might seem odd that the women’s childhood had an effect, previous studies have shown that a person’s childhood affects how they act as an adult.

In particular, those from rich and poor backgrounds can react very differently.

The study, published in the journal Human
 Nature, also found that women whose parents were well-off became 
choosier about a mate when they could hear time ticking away.

'Engrained': Researchers said the idea that a woman's ability to have a child is controlled by a biological clock is deeply engrained. So, females may associate a ticking sound with their childbearing years slipping away

Interestingly, men’s attitude towards settling down and having a family wasn’t influenced by the ticking clock.

The Florida State University researchers said: ‘Women’s reproductive capacity is strongly constrained by their age.

‘Unlike men, who can produce offspring until a very old age, women lose their ability to conceive children at menopause.

‘Subtle clues that signal the passage of time – such as the perception of a ticking clock – may signal threats to a woman’s reproductive potential.’
