These terrifying, close-up images capture the moment a group of fearless divers hand-fed some of the world's most dangerous sharks.

Surrounded by hammerheads and oceanic white tips the unflappable feeders calmly offered up morsels of fish on skewers.

The divers, who wore protective chainmail suits designed to prevent sharks' teeth from piercing their skin, were photographed by Jan Phillip Morton.

Observers were placed at a safe distance with front row seats for the heart-racing show.

Though the shots may look dangerous, Morton, 46, insisted everything possible was done to make sure the feeds are carried out in a safe environment.

The snapper, who lives in Nassau, Bahamas, said: 'Sharks are the apex predators of the seas and oceans who throughout the years have taken on a fierce and unjustified reputation.

'When visited underwater these creatures are curious and remarkably gentle.

'Shark numbers are declining rapidly through human activity and overfishing and although controversial, shark feeds are an excellent way to educate people on the subject of shark conservation and ocean health.

'Shark feeding is not something anyone should try on their own without the proper training.

The sheer scale of the diving challenge is all too apparent here as at any moment things could take a dramatic turn for the worse

'It is a dangerous activity best left to professionals.'

According to renowned oceanographer Jacques Cousteau oceanic whitetips should be considered as 'the most dangerous of all sharks'.

The reason for this theory is large numbers of shark deaths have been attributed to whitetips due to their presence around the likes of shipwrecks and aircraft crashes.
