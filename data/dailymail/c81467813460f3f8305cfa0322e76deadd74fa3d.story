A couple who finally conceived after nine years of trying lost their baby because of a fatal human error by hospital staff, an inquest heard.

Karen Legg, 37, and her husband Sion, 30, were overjoyed when she became pregnant naturally with Alyssa Rose after four courses of unsuccessful fertility treatment.

But their daughter died at just seven days old last July because she had been starved of oxygen at birth.

Tragic: Alyssa Rose Legg died at just a week old after being starved of oxygen at birth. An inquest heard she would have survived had she been delivered 18 minutes earlier

An inquest heard a bungling doctor at Nottingham City Hospital missed vital signs the baby was in distress and failed to order a Caesarean section in time – a decision which could have saved her life.

As a result the otherwise healthy infant suffered multiple organ failure.

Coroner Heidi Connor ruled at the inquest last week that Alyssa Rose would have survived if the C-section operation had been carried out just 18 minutes earlier.

The hospital has admitted that poor care in the late stages of labour led to the death, and blamed human error.

Mrs Legg said: ‘It took me nine years to conceive Alyssa Rose. She was an incredibly precious baby. The post-mortem examination proved that my daughter was perfectly healthy. She was a big baby at 8lb 10oz.

‘They couldn’t find a single thing wrong with her other than the fact she was brain-dead. And that was simply because they [hospital staff] wouldn’t intervene and do a C-section. The doctor kept saying we’ll leave it another half an hour.’

Delivering a narrative verdict, the coroner said: ‘It was an individual human error … she died after the late stages of labour after her [mother’s] care was incorrectly managed. Better management would likely have meant Alyssa Legg would not have died.’

The inquest heard Mrs Legg went to the hospital on July 9 believing her waters had broken, but she was sent away and told to return the next day to be induced.

When she came back, she was attached to a CTG machine which monitors the baby’s heartbeat and the rate of contractions.

After her waters broke at 4.10pm the doctor noted activity on the CTG machine was suspicious – but took no further action.

However, when the shift changed at 9pm, another doctor checked the vital signs again and realised the seriousness of the situation, immediately calling for an emergency C-section. By then it was too late and Alyssa Rose was born not breathing and without a heartbeat. Despite the efforts of the neonatal unit to save her, she died on July 17.

No disciplinary action has been taken against the doctor responsible for the fatal error.

A spokesman for Nottingham University Hospitals Trust said: ‘The doctor’s practice has been reviewed and as this was a single incident they were not deemed to be a danger, therefore no formal disciplinary action was taken.’

Apology: The hospital has admitted that 'sub-standard care' in the late stages of Mrs Legg's labour led to the death and blamed 'human error' for the fatal mistake

After the verdict, Alyssa’s parents called for a further investigation and said the hospital had not learnt from the death.

The couple, from Hucknall in Nottinghamshire, added that they are considering legal action against the Trust.

Mrs Legg said: ‘This inquest was the opportunity to expose the failings in my case and ask the questions that nobody is answering.

‘But we feel it was a missed opportunity to learn the lessons from my case. I felt I wasn’t listened to and my concerns were ignored by staff with devastating consequences.’

Mrs Legg said she should have been identified as a high-risk pregnancy because she had been diagnosed with endometriosis, a condition affecting the lining of the womb. Her labour was also ten days overdue and her waters broke early with discolouration – a known risk factor.

But despite these warning signs, she claims hospital staff were not vigilant to possible problems.

‘Sion was so looking forward to being a father,’ she said.

‘Everything seems to have gone wrong in the last 24 hours … the medical staff need to listen to, and act on, the concerns of mothers, they need to be more alert to potential complications.’

The Trust spokesman added: ‘We appreciate that this is little consolation but apologise unreservedly that we provided poor care.’
