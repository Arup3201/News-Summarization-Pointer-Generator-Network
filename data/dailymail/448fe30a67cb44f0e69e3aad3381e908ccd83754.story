A round up of some of the more unusual happenings from the final round of the USPGA Championship at Valhalla. 

Olesen Flag day

Unluckiest shot of the early play? That surely belonged to the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, who was three under par for his round when his tee shot to the par-three eighth hit the flagstick and bounced off the green. Instead of a tap-in birdie he ran up a bogey.

Unlucky: Dane Thorbjorn Olesen saw his tee shot on the eighth rebound off the flagstick and roll off the green

Phil hits hold-up

Spare a little sympathy for Phil Mickelson. In pursuit of joining Sir Nick Faldo on six majors, he turned up at 9.30am for his 2.45pm tee-time, practised for over three hours … and then came the weather delay. Still, it showed why the 44-year-old has the greatest short game ever seen.

Game of patience: Phil Mickelson pictured leaving the practice ground before the bad weather moved in

Quick code switch

Rory McIlroy changed his phone’s passcode after being caught on American television tapping in 1256. What do the numbers stand for? Twelve majors and 56 victories by the time he’s done? Rory wasn’t too stressed, tweeting ‘Passcode changed. Now for some golf’.

Passcode problems: Rory McIlroy's phone PIN was inadvertently broadcast on American television
