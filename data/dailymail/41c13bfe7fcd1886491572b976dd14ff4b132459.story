Edinson Cavani is certainly known as a sharp shooter but the Paris Saint-Germain striker's rifle celebration has come under fire since his sending off at Lens last Friday.

The Uruguay star, who scored PSG's winner in the Champions League at Apoel Nicosia on Tuesday and again pretended to shoot, is in fact an avid hunter.

Hence, when Cavani fires in one of his many goals he performs a gun-toting gesture, similar to that of a huntsman.

The 27-year-old celebrated his goal with his customary 'rifle' celebration that hit the headlines last week

Remarkably, he was booked at Lens last Friday after converting a penalty and carrying out his celebration, which he has used for years. He was then, however, sent off after becoming embroiled in a heated argument with referee Nicolas Rainville.

His father Luis revealed before the World Cup that Cavani, on a 48-hour break from the Uruguayan training camp, returned to his home town of Salto for a nocturnal hunting session, during which he managed to haul two boars and six hares.

'It's always been football first, then hunting for Edi. He loves it and he's a good shot at both!' Luis told the Telegraph.

'We always did it when he was a kid and we still do. He came here from the camp in Montevideo and everything he hadn't done in a whole year while he's been in Paris, he has to cram in over two days,' added Luis before the World Cup.

'So we spent them fishing and hunting, getting only three hours sleep both nights. It was crazy but he did it.

'Edi's not going to stop doing it! As for fishing, he always says it calms him. This has always been a way of life for us.'

Paris Saint Germain forward Edinson Cavani cannot believe his red card during the clash with Lens

So, Cavani's hunting roots explain the background of his rifle celebration and the striker defended his actions having repeated the gesture after scoring the winner in Cyprus on Tuesday.

'The most important thing for a striker is to score. The most important thing for the team was to make a step further in the Champions League.

'That was my decision to do that, this time it will not be misinterpreted. My expulsion against Lens? We all have the right to make mistakes. We are all human beings, television pictures seem obviously in my favour. It was not bad, it just was misinterpreted. I work hard to perform well for my team to score goals.'

Cavani, seen scoring for Uruguay in the World Cup this summer, went home to hunt on a break from training

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has strongly criticised the referee's decision to send off Cavai at Lens, insisting punishments given for such celebrations are negative for French football.

'It is the media's job to speak about the referee,' he told Canal+. 'Cavani does not deserve that red card. And why has he got a yellow before? He always does the same celebration.

'This is not normal and it is not good for French football if we want to develop. It is a bad situation for everyone.'
