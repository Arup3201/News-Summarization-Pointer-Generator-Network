Smiling in front of a bear cage in Russia, three-year-old Dasha Kopylova begged her mother to take a picture so she could show off to her friends.

But moments after the image was taken Dasha was fighting for her life after the animal ripped her hand off and began eating it.

The bear lashed out after Dasha poked her hand through the cage while her mother Olga's back was turned.

The tragedy happened at a Russia holiday camp where Olga works as a cleaner. She had taken daughter Dasha along with her to keep an eye on her.

Olga, 35, said: 'I can't afford a place for her in one of the private kindergartens so when I don't have anyone to look after I just take with me.

'The bear is kept in a cage at the park and she wanted to have a picture taken to show her friends. I did warn you not to get too close but I left alone for a second because she asked for a drink of water.

'I only turned my back for a second when I suddenly heard her screaming, and I ran back to find her lying on the ground next to the bear cage.

'She had a bloody stump where a hand had been and I saw the bear holding it in his front paws, chewing away.

'I tried to provide the first aid and took her to the local hospital. But local doctors said they could not provide the necessary help.

'There was not even an ambulance to transfer my girl to the nearest city hospital in Shakhty.'

Olga says she took Dasha to work with her at a holiday camp where the bear is kept as an attraction, but the accident happened while her back was turned to get water

Dasha is now in a stable condition but faces rehabilitation work to get used to life without her right hand

After finding a car and a driver, the mother and her wounded daughter spent almost an hour on the road, before eventually reaching the nearest casualty unit.

When they finally arrived to the city hospital, doctors took her straight into the intensive care unit where she was operated on.

After the operation, the girl spent several days in intensive care, but medics say she is now stable and out of danger - although she is missing a hand and has a long round of rehabilitation and treatment ahead of her.

Dasha's father, Igor Kopylov, 37, said he is happy that his daughter is alive, but blames village authorities in Melihovo, western Russia, for not providing enough kindergarten places for children.
