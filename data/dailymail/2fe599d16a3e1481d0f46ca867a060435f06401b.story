Manchester United defender Patrice Evra is expected to proceed with his £2.5million transfer to Juventus.

The Frenchman has held talks with new Juve coach Massimo Allegri who has reassured Evra that he is still very much wanted despite Antonio Conte resigning.

United remain keen on Thomas Vermaelen of Arsenal, who has been holidaying with best friend Robin Van Persie, and Stefan de Vrij, 22, of Feyenoord.

Veteran: Evra signed a new deal in May but will be leaving United this summer and heading for Italy

World Cup standard: Evra competes with Thomas Muller at the World Cup

Lazio have had a bid rejected for 
22-year-old de Vrij and Feyenoord director of sport Martin Van Geel told
 RTV Rijnmond: 'It is logical for the player to leave, but it has to be 
for the right club and the right price. I am happy we did not accept 
Lazio’s offer, as it was too low. After that, no other proposal has been
 received.'

Ajax defender 
Daley Blind, 24, is also among United's options. Blackburn and Cardiff 
are interested in taking United defender Michael Keane on loan.

Third place: De Vrij is wanted by Van Gaal after playing under him at the World Cup for Holland

United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'There's a lot going on behind the scenes so watch this space.

'We’ve
 been working with Louis over several weeks with regards to targets and 
we’re continuing to move forward on some of those targets. We are still a
 huge attraction to top football stars around the world.'
