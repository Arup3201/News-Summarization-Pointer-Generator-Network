Silence: Jacqueline Cartner, 42, has accepted a confidential payout and signed a gagging order

A former Wren has been given a payout by the Ministry of Defence after claiming she suffered sexual discrimination in the Royal Navy.

Chief Petty Officer Jacqueline Cartner, 
42, claimed she was passed over for promotion because she refused to
go to sea after rules were changed to allow women on warships.

After two years of legal battles, CPO 
Cartner, who served at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hants,  has now accepted a confidential payout and signed a gagging 
order.

The MoD's move has killed off the threat of a legal precedent being set which may have led to dozens more lawsuits costing taxpayers millions of pounds.

CPO Cartner chose to retain non-seagoing status when the rules were changed to allow women on warships in 1993.

Around 70 per cent of Wrens opted for this status and were assured at the time that it would not harm their promotion prospects.

CPO Cartner, who was made an MBE in 2001, felt she was the best candidate for promotion to warrant officer when she went before a promotion board in 2008 as the only female candidate.

But she did not get the job and took the navy to an employment tribunal.

That ruled the navy discriminated against her on two grounds - directly because she was a woman and indirectly because she had non-seagoing status.

The navy appealed against the ruling in December 2010 but lost the part of the appeal relating to discrimination against her non-seagoing status.

It did, however, win the right for a re-hearing of evidence that CPO Cartner was directly discriminated against by members of the navy's promotions board solely because she was a woman.

Fearing a potential wave of litigation from other ex-wrens, the MoD spent £126,000 fighting the rulings, but the case has now been dropped.

A Royal Navy spokeswoman said: 'We are pleased this long-running case has now been concluded by mutual agreement.

'It has been a challenging time for both the MoD and Ms Cartner who gave many years of loyal and high quality service.

'We do wish Ms Cartner and her family well for the future.'

Ms Cartner was unable to comment because of the confidentiality order she signed.

The navy said it will now review the case to see if 'appropriate lessons' can be learned.

Former navy Wren and employment law expert Sue Ball said: 'This looks like a good result for the MoD.

'Litigation is always a risky and uncertain process and if the MoD had gone back to the tribunal again and it went against them it would have set a case law precedent that could have caused them a problem.'
