Birmingham City have rejected a third bid worth up to £3.5million from Bournemouth for teenage winger Demarai Gray.

Eddie Howe is eager to land the 18-year-old this window but has been rebuffed by Birmingham, who are determined to keep hold of their academy graduate and are under no financial pressure to sell.

Bournemouth’s latest offer, following on from bids of £1.5m and £2m, saw £3m guaranteed, with add-ons potentially pushing the final transfer value to £3.5m. Birmingham value Gray much higher.

Bournemouth have had a third bid of £3.5million for Demarai Gray rejected by Birmingham City

Gary Rowett has been consistent in his approach to Gray, who has seen increased game-time under the new Birmingham manager, insisting his current club is the right place for his development.

Gray, a quick and technically-gifted player, has attracted plenty of attention since breaking through at St Andrew’s and announced himself to the Championship with a hat-trick against Reading in early December.

Liverpool and Tottenham have maintained a watchful eye, while Crystal Palace had a £500,000 bid rejected last summer.

Gray’s contract has 18 months left to run and his he is in discussions about an extension.

Rowett has previously told Sportsmail: ‘He’s as good as any young player I’ve seen at this age. He gets the fans off the edge of their seats. I would expect if someone does want to buy him he’s not going to come cheap. There are not many young British players around who can go past people, are quick, and can score goals.’

 Gray has scored four goals in 20 games for the Blues so far this season
