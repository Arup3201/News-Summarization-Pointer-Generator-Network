From injured war veterans and young cancer survivors to a pensioner who makes 400 pots of jam a month for charity.

These are some of Britain’s most inspirational people who will help to carry the Olympic torch around the country next summer.

Yesterday, 6,800 people were told they had been selected as ‘citizen torchbearers’ at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, after they were nominated by friends, family and colleagues.

Chosen ones: Sarah Thomas, from Shrewsbury, left, has been picked to carry the torch, while 18-year-old Jess Colborn has been chosen after her amazing recovery from a stroke two years ago

Each bearer will carry the torch through their hometowns and villages during the 70-day relay across Britain.

Among them is 18-year-old Jess Colborn, who had to learn to walk and talk again when she suffered a stroke two years ago.

The A-Level student from Allenheads, Northumberland, feared she would never walk again when she was paralysed down the left side of her body and right side of her face.

But after months of physiotherapy, she has almost fully recovered and now hopes to study medicine at university.

She said: ‘Carrying the Olympic torch will be amazing. It will show just how far I have come.

‘The relay will be two years on from the stroke and will be a great way to celebrate.’

Fundraiser: Moira Starkey, 84, from Herefordshire, who has raised thousands for charity will carry the torch even though she uses two sticks to walk

She will be joined by 84-year-old Moira Starkey, who has raised thousands of pounds for a breast cancer support centre, Hereford Haven, through sales of her homemade jams and pickles.

Miss Starkey, who walks with two sticks, completed her first marathon at the age of 83 last year, by walking 2,000 times around her town hall.

She said: ‘It took me three months, but my friends kept me going by bringing in tapes of my favourite classical music.

‘It’s a great honour to be asked to be a torchbearer – I just hope I don’t drop it.’  

Miss Starkey, who has undergone two knee replacements, added: ‘After five laps of the town hall I would have a rest and a cup of tea and then carry on.’

Miss Starkey, of Storridge, Herefordshire, made so many jams for charity that she was invited to meet Prince Charles during a visit to the town.

She said: ‘This week alone I have made 23 Damson jams, 21 strawberry jams, 15 marmalades and 10 lemon curds. Prince Charles approved of the lemon curd, he likes that best.’

Matt Short, 20, of Tonbridge, Kent, was a keen rugby and tennis player until he was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer at the age of 16 and had to have his leg amputated.

The teenager, who has set up the Ewing’s Sarcoma Research Trust, says completing the torch relay will be a particularly poignant moment.

He said: ‘Hopefully it will mark an end to my period of recovery and be a new beginning.’

Holly Hamill, 17, of Glengormly, Northern Ireland, was nominated by her gymnastics coach for overcoming cystic fibrosis to win four gold medal apparatus medals at the Rhythmic British Championships.

Stunned: Rachel Nafzger said she couldn't believe she had been chosen for the relay. She will walk the course alongside her guide dog Nikita

She said: ‘It is amazing to be part of this. I just hope I don’t fall over.

‘My condition makes things harder because my chest is tight. It can be a downer but I just focus on my ability not my disability.

‘I hope I can show people that by doing the relay.’

Rachel Nafzger, 21, will walk the torch relay with her guide dog Nikita.

She was born four months premature with limited sight, but that has not stopped her living independently.

She left her home in Northamptonshire 
to study English literature at Plymouth, where she is a member of 
several voluntary groups.

She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I was told I had been chosen.

‘Nikita will love the crowds because she’s an attention-seeker.’

 The remaining 1,200 torchbearers will be announced in January.

Eight thousands people were chosen from a shortlist of 28,000 hopefuls to take part in the relay after being selected by sponsors Lloyds TSB, Samsung and Coca-Cola.

It was announced yesterday that Dublin will also be included in the relay, in a bid to include Ireland in the celebrations.

The naming of the torchbearers was somewhat overshadowed by events earlier this week, when it was revealed that more taxpayers money would be pumped into the Olympic Games.

Yesterday, Lord Sebastian Coe admitted that the Olympics organising committee would be ‘living ‘hand to mouth’ in coming months.

The admission will only fuel fears that the Government will be forced to invest in excess of the £9.3bn already pledged for the competition.

Ministers recently agreed to put £41million towards the opening and closing ceremonies, doubling its budget.

Simeon Wakely, from Bath, a wheelchair tennis and basketball player, described his nomination as 'a shinning example of what can be achieved when you set your mind to it', while Lord Coe also displayed the torch

The event was supposed to be paid for by the privately-funded organising committee Locog, but the Prime Minister himself stepped in, apparently to give the four ceremonies the ‘wow factor’.

It was also revealed this week that a further £271million will need to be invested in security after organisers wildly underestimated the number of security guards required at the Games. The total security bill is now in excess of £1bn.

Yesterday, Locog chairman Lord Coe said that keeping the Games on budget over the next six months ‘will be a challenge’, but that Locog was ‘driving down on costs’ where they could.

‘We will be living hand to mouth now until the Olympic Games. As you get towards the games, there’s a build up of pressure’, he said.

‘It will be tough. These are the hard months everyone was predicting six months ago.’
