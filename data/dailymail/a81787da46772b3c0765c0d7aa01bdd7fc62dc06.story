A woman was taken to A&E after she blinded herself by overdosing on controversial anti-malaria pills while sleepwalking.

Confused and unable to see, the 55-year-old was rushed to the emergency room where she complained of headaches and severe dizziness.

Only when her daughter reportedly found an empty packet of quinine sulphate tablets, an anti-malaria drug, on the kitchen counter was it confirmed she had taken them while sleepwalking.

Danger: Doctors were warned off giving British patients quinine sulphate, pictured, for leg cramps in 2010

The unnamed woman had been taking the anti-malaria drug once a day to treat leg cramps.

It has potentially serious side-effects, however, including hearing and sight problems, vertigo, headaches, nausea, diarrhoea and confusion.

The case was presented in British 
Medical Journal Case Reports by two doctors at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Dr Amit Sinha and ophthalmologist Dr Sahar Al Husainy, as a warning to doctors about the dangers 
of prescribing the drug.

However, the woman got away comparatively lightly - as overdoses can cause irreversible blindness or even death, according to the NHS.

The full report said the woman claimed she felt like she had taken some pills while sleepwalking, Livescience reported.

Unusual: The discovery was made by doctors at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, pictured, who reported it to the British Medical Journal. The report said the woman still had severe sight problems a year later

They ruled she had been a victim of 
quinine poisioning. Her sight improved slightly the next day but it was 
still dark and she could not make out colours, the website added.

Her
vision was reportedly still badly damaged a year later - with no peripheral vision
at all - and showed no signs of improving.

Dr Sinha and Dr Al Husainy wrote: 'Following a thorough investigation and 
assessment, a diagnosis of ocular quinine toxicity was made.

'We present 
this case and highlight the risks of quinine prescription.'

British patients were warned off taking the drug for leg cramps in 2010 by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

The agency said: 'Quinine is not a routine treatment for nocturnal leg cramps, and should only be considered when cramps cause regular disruption of sleep.

'Quinine should only be considered when cramps are very painful or frequent, when other treatable causes of cramp have been ruled out, and when non-pharmacological measures have not worked (eg, passive stretching exercises).

'After an initial trial of 4 weeks, treatment should be stopped if there is no benefit.'
