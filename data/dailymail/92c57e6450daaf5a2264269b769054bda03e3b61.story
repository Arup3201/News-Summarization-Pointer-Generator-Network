AKA Jeff Gillooly: In 1994, Jeff Stone--who then went by Jeff Gillooly--helped mastermind the attack on Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan to help improve his wife Tonya Harding's chances as winning gold

The ex-husband of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding has given a rare interview as the 20 year anniversary of the scandal approaches early next year.

Jeff Gillooly, who now goes by Jeff Stone, is the same man who went to jail for masterminding the 1994 Detroit attack on Nancy Kerrigan, but he seems more remorseful about how Harding’s life has turned out two decades later.

‘She'll never be remembered for how wonderful a figure skater she was,’ he said. ‘She'll be remembered for what I talked her into doing.’

Stone, who remains in the Oregon town
 of Clackamas, after returning there when he was released from a 
two-year stint in prison in 1995, sat for a rare interview with Amy K. 
Nelson for the blog Deadspin.

‘The
 most common question I'm ever asked, if it comes up, "Do you regret 
what you did?"’ said Stone. ‘I guess that's kind of a yes-and-a-no 
question. Yes, it was pretty darn stupid.’

But
 Stone goes on to describe a his happy life as a family man with a wife 
and kids. And he seems to believe the 1994 scandal helped him to get 
there.

‘What's there to regret,’ he wondered. ‘Not much.’

He’s
 also not totally taking the blame, though, despite Tonya Harding’s 
years of denying she had any knowledge of what Gillooly and his 
associates, Shane Stant, who carried out the attack, and 
co-conspirators, Shawn Eckhardt and Derrick Smith were planning.

'What's there to regret? Not much': Gillooly is pictured here in 1994 in a court hearing involving the case. Now on his third marriage and raising tow daughters, he says he regrets little

'We decided to do something really stupid there, and it ruined her': Gillooly was sentenced to two years in prison but says his biggest regret is helping ruin Harding's career

‘We,’ he said, ‘absolutely rode her career. She was the best figure skater—women's figure skater—that ever lived.’

And he insists Harding knew what was being planned.

‘Of course she did. I think most people know that she did,’ he said.

Though he seems to think he’s in a far better place than his ex-wife these days.

'Whack heard round the world': Here, Kerrigan wails 'Why me?' after being clubbed in the knee at a Detroit skating practice. The attack began one of the most infamous sagas in sports history

'Of course she knew': Harding (at right in 1994 and at left much more recently) maintains that she had no knowledge that the attack was happening, but Stone says she gave the okay

Kerrigan, seen here in 2004, sat for an upcoming NBC documentary on the attack that will air during the 2014 Winter Olympics in February

‘She's
 a very unhappy person, from what I can tell,’ he said. ‘I occasionally 
see her on television and I kind of see—I've read some stories in the 
paper about what her personal life has become and the trouble she's got 
there, and it's just sad to me.’

Harding
 and Stone divorced in 1993, according to the piece in Deadspin, 
reconciled prior to the Kerrigan attack and then split for good 
thereafter.

Stone and Harding sold a sex tape and stills of themselves to Penthouse for $200,000 plus residuals in June of 1994.

Now in her 40’s, married for a third time and with a two-year-old son, Harding says she’s turned to motivational speaking.

Stone
 recounts in the interview how Jeff Gillooly became a punch line on late
 night television, Far Side comics, Saturday Night Live and even on 
Family Guy.

NBC and 
ESPN are planning to air competing Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding 
documentaries during the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympics as a nod to the 
anniversary of the January 6, 1994 attack.

However, neither network even asked Stone for an interview.

NBC snagged a sit-down with Kerrigan for its documentary, while Harding agreed to appear in both the NBC and ESPN specials.

But will Stone be watching?

‘I guess,’ he said, ‘it depends on what else is on.’

Awkward: Harding, (right), will appear in both the NBC documentary and a competing ESPN special to mark the 20th anniversary. Here, the rivals are seen sharing the ice at the 1994 Winter Olympics just weeks after Gillooly had Kerrigan attacked
