Great Britain's Jordanne Whiley won her first Wimbledon title as she and wheelchair women's doubles partner Yui Kamiji closed in on a calendar Grand Slam of all four majors.

The 22-year-old from Halesowen and 20-year-old Japanese player Kamiji were 2-6 6-2 7-5 winners on Court 17 against the Dutch pairing of Jiske Griffioen and Aniek van Koot.

Closing in: Whiley says 'there's pressure now because we're three-quarters of the way to a Grand Slam'

Whiley and Kamiji have already won the Australian Open and French Open titles this year and will head to New York in September aiming to add the US Open to complete a sweep of the slams.

From 5-3 in front in the deciding set, Whiley and Kamiji dropped their next service game to put the set back on serve, but they seized a further break in going on to clinch the trophy, earning shared prize money of Â£12,000.
