Two 'perfect faces' - created from the features of glamorous actresses, singers and models - reveal the stark differences between how men and women perceive female beauty.

In a beauty survey, men and women were asked to build up a perfect face from the features of some of the most beautiful women in the world.

The research revealed that men prefer blonde hair, full lips, and strong cheekbones but also a petite nose, less prominent forehead and finer eyebrows.

Women see the epitome of beauty as raven hair, a stronger nose and forehead profile, strong brows and narrower bone structure.

The
 most popular features for men were Shakira's cascading blonde hair, 
Miranda Kerr's button nose, the forehead of Jennifer Aniston, the 
Duchess of Cambridge's pronounced eyebrows and Angelina Jolie's 
cheekbones - as well as her famously full lips.

THE PERFECT FEMALE FACE... ACCORDING TO WOMEN: Men and women were asked to choose celebrities with their preferred features. As the graphic reveals, women went for glossy hair, refined cheekbones, strong brows and nose and a sensual mouth like Scarlett Johansson's

Women's
 selections for the perfect female face included Freida Pinto's glossy 
black mane, Keira Knightley's refined cheekbones, Cara Delevingne's 
bushy bold brows, Blake Lively's strong nose and Scarlett Johansson's 
pout.

A spokesperson for escentual.com, who commissioned the survey,Â  said: 'These two pictures demonstrate the different ideals men and women have when it comes to the female face.

'It seems men are still of the opinion that blondes have all the fun and picked out Columbian singer Shakira's long platinum waves as their preferred hair style, while women favour a more exotic type of beauty, choosing Freida Pinto's raven locks.

'Interestingly, the faces are made up of a mix of different ages - 38-year-old Angelina Jolie was men's preferred choice for cheekbones and pout while 21-year-old Cara Delevingne was the women's top choice for eyebrows.

'Meanwhile, Shakira, 36, had the men's preferred hairstyle and a 44-year-old Jennifer Aniston's was their preferred forehead shape.

'The differences seen in the results from men and women are quite extreme so when it comes to female looks - perhaps men really are from Mars and women from Venus?'
