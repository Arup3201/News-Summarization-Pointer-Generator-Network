The American soldier who entered a village and murdered 16 civilians in Afghanistan may now have documents that directly link his alleged crimes to use of the antimalarial drug mefloquine.

Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month of slaughtering village people in the country’s Kandahar province in March 2012. It has since been suggested that Bales’ previous head injury, paired with use of the common drug, contributed to his homicidal actions but no direct link had previously been uncovered.

Now, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ‘adverse event’ notification has been discovered from 2012 in which the pharmacist refers to a soldier who killed over a dozen Afghani civilians after taking the mefloquine, which is known to adversely affect 5-10 percent of users and comes with a warning that those with previous brain trauma should not use the drug.

Link? An FDA 'adverse event' report has been uncovered that may link antimalarial drug mefloquine to a U.S. soldier's murder of 16 Afghani civilians in 2012

Cold blood: Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month to entering an Afghani village and murdering 16, mostly women and children

As Bales faces a potential life 
sentence, his attorney John Henry Browne has publicly brought up his 
history with the controversial malarial drug—which is linked to 
paranoia, hallucinations and psychosis—while on a previous deployment in
Iraq. However, Browne has not said if he intends cite mefloquine as a 
contributing factor to his client’s crimes.

Browne
did admit he had no indication that the pharmacist's notification was 
filed by anyone with direct knowledge of Bales' use of the drug in 
Afghanistan.

Army 
officials have not commented on whether Bales took mefloquine in 
Afghanistan leading up to the attack, citing confidentiality laws that 
protect a patient's records.

The defense has argued that Bales, 
the father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from 
post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his 
deployment to Afghanistan.

Some experts urge against blaming the drug completely, however.

'Tens of millions of people take it,' Dr. David Sullivan of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute told ABC News.
'Honestly, you cannot implicate any one thing. To put it all on 
mefloquine is not fair. [Bales] already has a predisposition because of a
traumatic brain injury and he has taken this drug in a stressful 
situation. You have to put it in context here...but you can't exclude 
it.'

The pill's fault? As Bales awaits sentencing, new documents link his behavior to the use of mefloquine, though he also admits to steroid and alcohol use

FDA spokesperson Stephanie Yao told ABC the anonymous report was authentic, though it's impossible to know who submitted it.

'These are voluntary reports,' she said. 'They are anonymous mainly because of the regulations protecting patient information, so names are not included.'

Dr. Remington Nevin, an Army major and epidemiologist called mefloquine a 'zombie drug.'

'It's dangerous and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Nevin, who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain.

He called it 'probably the worst-suited drug for the military' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat, making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult.

Bales slipped away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early on March 11, 2012, and attacked compounds in nearby villages.

Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily stopped combat operations in Afghanistan.

Previous issue: Bales had a history of brain trauma, which should have precluded his use of the controversial, yet widely used, antimalarial drug

Under questioning from the judge, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, Bales said that his use of illegal steroids, which he admitted taking to improve muscle tone and recovery time from missions, also ‘increased my irritability and anger.’

During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings.

One corporal recounted that in the hours before the rampage he, Bales and a third soldier had been drinking whiskey together while watching the Hollywood film ‘Man on Fire,’ which stars Denzel Washington as a former assassin bent on revenge.

Night-vision video footage taken from
a surveillance balloon over the camp captured Bales' arrest, showing 
him walking back to the post with a bed sheet or throw rug tied around 
his neck like a cloak as he is confronted by three soldiers who order 
him to drop his weapons and then take him into custody.

One
of them, drinking buddy Corporal David Godwin, testified that Bales 
kept repeating the words, ‘I thought I was doing the right thing,’ and, 
‘It's bad. It's bad. It's really bad.’

Army officials said some family members of the victims are expected to give statements at the sentencing hearing next month.

The
plea deal entered in June was similar to an agreement struck at 
Lewis-McChord in April, when Army Sergeant John Russell pleaded guilty 
to killing two fellow U.S. servicemen at a military counseling center in
Iraq, near Baghdad's airport, in a 2009 shooting spree.

Russell
was sentenced to life in prison without parole following an abbreviated
court-martial stemming from one of the worst cases of violence by an 
American soldier against other U.S. troops.

A jury will decide in August whether the soldier is sentenced to life with or without the possibility of parole.

Reparations? A woman with her grandchild, who was killed by Bales in 2012. The White House has since given $50,000 compensation for every victim

While use of mefloquine is relatively common in the Middle East, it is not a first-line treatment and is not indicated for use by anyone with a history of brain injury or seizure
