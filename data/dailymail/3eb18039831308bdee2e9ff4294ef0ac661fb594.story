A pensioner has appeared in court charged with manslaughter after a 64-year-old man died following a row over a disabled parking space at Asda.

Alan Watts, 65, was granted bail at Biggleswade Magistrates earlier today in his first court  appearance since he was charged following the death of Brian Holmes on Sunday.

Mr Holmes suffered serious head injuries in a fall outside the Asda store in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, following an alleged row with Mr Watts in the car park on Saturday afternoon.

He was rushed to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, but died the following day.

It later emerged that he had only been given the all-clear in a battle with cancer just days earlier.

Grandfather Mr Watts, a builder from Biggleswade, spoke only to confirm his name and address.

He asked the court clerk to 'speak up' when being questioned about his home address.

He was told he must surrender his passport and should not apply for any foreign travel documents while on bail.

Mr Watts must also sign in at Biggleswade Police Station every day.

He was ordered not to drive, nor visit 
Sandy, in Bedfordshire, where his son and Mr Holmes' family live, and told he 
cannot attend the Asda store where the alleged manslaughter took place.

Presiding Magistrate Dr Wendi Momem told Mr Watts that he must next appear at Luton Crown Court on August 28.

As he left the court Mr Watts wore a brown cap and held papers in front of his face as photographers attempted to take pictures.

Following his death, Mr Holmes's family said that he and his wife Christine 60, whom he married nine years ago, had only just started to plan their future together after his all-clear from cancer.

In a statement, they said: ‘The family are devastated by the loss of Brian in such shocking circumstances.

‘A wife has lost her husband, best friend and carer all in one go.

‘Brian was a family man who adored his grandchildren and family, and had only last week been given the all-clear following treatment for cancer.

‘Brian and his wife were only just starting to make plans for the future that they only dared to dream of.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
