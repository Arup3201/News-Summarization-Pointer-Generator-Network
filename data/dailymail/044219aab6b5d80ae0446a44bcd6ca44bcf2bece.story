Wolf of Wall Street fans with cash to burn take note: the luxury Manhattan penthouse portrayed in the film can now be yours for a cool $6.5 million.

The 3-bedroom pad that Leonardo DiCaprio’s character Jordan Belfort called home in the Hollywood hit boasts 2,500-square-feet in an East Midtown high-rise called the Milan.

And in addition to having starred in a Martin Scorsese film, the apartment even has its own celebrity realtor in Million Dollar Listings’ Ryan Serhant.

‘You certainly won't find another apartment like it in East Midtown, where everything else is just cookie cutter,’ Serhant told the New York Daily News. ‘It feels like a loft floating above the city.’

In addition to the bedroom, where DiCaprio and stunning leading lady Margot Robbie shared some steamy moments in the film, fans will surely recognize the unforgettable living room.

Its open floor plan and floor to ceiling windows were the backdrop for a scene featuring Jonah Hill where his and DiCaprio’s characters get violent with a colleague who rats out their illegal dealings to authorities.

Even more memorable are the patio with its breath-taking Manhattan views and the Wolf of Wall Street scene filmed there.

It is there where the squealing colleague is dangles over the edge, 31 stories above Manhattan’s Second Avenue.

In fact, the view is so good it might cause its next high-powered occupant a to develop a little bit of a God complex.

‘I can totally see a new master of the universe calling this place home,’ Serhant said.
