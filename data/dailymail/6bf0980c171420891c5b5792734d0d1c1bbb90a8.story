The NYPD is set to stop arresting people who are caught with small amounts of marijuana in their possession and will issue tickets instead.

The move would see those who have previously been handcuffed and taken to a police station being given court summons instead. 

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced that the official change to the city's marijuana policy will  take effect November 19.

Changes: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, pictured holding up a bag or marijuana alongside Mayor Bill de Blasio, announced that minor marijuana possession will no longer lead to arrest but court summons instead 

He said at a press conference on Monday: 'Make no mistake, marijuana is still illegal in New York City. People smoking marijuana in public will continue to be arrested. 

'But possession of small amounts, with certain exceptions, is not considered a high enough level of offense to merit the time and resources the Department spends when arresting people, or the potential associated consequences of criminal justice involvement for the arrestees.

Mayor Bill De Blasio added: 'This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations.

'Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. 

'We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.'

In the first 10 months of 2014, the NYPD has received approximately 23,000 911 or 311 calls from New Yorkers complaining about the sale or public smoking of marijuana in their neighborhoods. This is almost a 30 per cent increase over last year.

The new summons policy reflects the distinction New Yorkers make between the more significant crimes of smoking and dealing, and possession of small amounts of marijuana 

According to the New York Times, suspects caught carrying under 25 grams of the drug on their person 'may be eligible', however people caught burning or smoking it will still be arrested.   

It would be a significant step towards to addressing the department's controversial stop-and-frisk policy.

In May it was reported that minor marijuana arrests in New York City have plunged in recent years amid questions about police tactics.

However statistics showed the arrests dropped more modestly in the first three months of De Blasio's adminisration, even after pledges to reduce them. 

New guidelines: The Mayor's office tweeted as the announcement was being made 

Arrests for the lowest-level marijuana crime fell 34 percent in the first quarter of 2013 — and 9 percent in the first quarter of this year, to roughly 7,000, according to state Division of Criminal Justice Services data.

Since 1977, New York state has considered possession of less than 25 grams (about 7/8 of an ounce) a non-criminal violation akin to a traffic ticket — unless the drug is 'open to public view.' 

In those cases, it's a misdemeanor, spurring an arrest record and potentially three months in jail, though many cases get dismissed if defendants avoid rearrest. 

The arrests averaged about 2,100 a year from 1978 through 1995, but more than 36,700 per year from 1996 through 2011. Federal data show marijuana use nationwide has risen, but far less dramatically, during the last decade. 

After the arrests — and outcry — hit a high in 2011, the arrests plummeted from about 50,700 then to 28,600 last year.
