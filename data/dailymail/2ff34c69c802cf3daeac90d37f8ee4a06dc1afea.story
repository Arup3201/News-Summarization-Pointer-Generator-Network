Months of anticipation finally came to an end on Friday night as Sam Burgess made his eagerly anticipated rugby union debut in Bath’s victory over Harlequins.

The league convert looked every inch the poster boy as he was brought on as a second half replacement at the Rec.

His arrival was greeted by cheers and all cameras were focussed on the player Russell Crowe calls ‘the ‘sparkly-eyed man’.

His arrival from Australia — South Sydney Rabbitohs owner Crowe took him over there in 2010 — has been one of the most hyped-up signings of all time and it was the perfect start as his side moved to the top of the table with a convincing victory over their play-off rivals.

Afterwards, Burgess  said: ‘I just wanted to get out there to try and enjoy it. I had a few experienced guy around me and the whole squad has been great. I have a lot to learn and it was good to be part of a win.’

The Yorkshireman had to wait until the 63rd minute to get on. Among those also hoping to make their mark were England trio Danny Care, Kyle Eastmond and Semesa Rokoduguni who were all released for club duty. 

Eastmond, another league convert, was turned over early on by Kyle Sinckler, but his mistake was amended when Matt Banahan scored the first try after nine minutes. Eastmond doubled the lead inside the first quarter. Ollie Devoto missed the conversion but found his range as he went on to exchange penalties with Nick Evans.

Quins trailed by 10 points at half time but the reliable Evans opened the scoring with anther penalty early in the second half. Bath continued to dominate the set piece and their pressure in the scrum resulted in a yellow card for Sinckler in the 54th minute. 

He was joined in the sin bin by George Robson and Will Collier and, with a three-man advantage, Bath gave Burgess the orders to warm up. He came on for back Horacio Agulla and it took three defenders to bring him down on his first carry. Forwards Ross Batty and Leroy Houston then extended the lead with further tries.
