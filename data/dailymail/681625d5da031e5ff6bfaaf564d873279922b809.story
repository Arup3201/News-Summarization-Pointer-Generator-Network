A disused railway linesman's hut in Scotland has gone on sale for £10,000.

While the station it used to service has long gone, the railway line that passes within just inches of the building is still in use - with commuter trains whistling past every hour.

While owner Ian Burns, 40, says it would make the perfect retreat for a hiking or fishing enthusiast, he admits the new owners will have to be train lovers as well.  

Dream home: Ian Burns, 40, bought this railway linesman's hut two years ago after passing it while on the train as a child and joking to his brother how nice it would be to live there

Niche market: However after having his plans to renovate the building shot down by the local council he is now selling it, and admits the new owners would have to be train lovers

Mr Burns, originally from Dundee used to pass the hut in New Haven, Angus,  when he took the train on holiday as a boy around 25 years ago.

He once joked with his brother about how nice it would be to live in the hut, and when it came on the market two year ago he 'couldn't resist' buying it. 

However he has been forced into selling the property after the local council blocked his plans to renovate it. 

He said he has already received an offer for £20,000, but turned it down because the buyer planned to demolish the hut, an idea he is firmly against.

He said: 'It would be perfect for someone who liked walking or fishing to use, because there's lots of good place to go around here. It's only about ten minutes from the beach too.

'You would definitely have to like trains though, because they pass within touching distance about once every hour. 

'It's a really historic little hut, around 100 years old, and made out of old railway sleepers. Everyone knows it locally and I don't think you'll find another one like it.'

Mr Burns, who owns a landscaping company, said he bought it because he just liked the idea of owning it, but soon developed plans to bring it back to its former glory. 

However he found his plans for allotments and a green waste recycling centre were shot down by the local council.

He added: 'It is sad because if the right people don't buy it, it will just get flat-packed.

'I think the council just want it gone. They'd be happy if the land was just flattened and had a pony put on it or something, but that would be a huge waste.

Valuable: Mr Burns says he has already had an offer of £20,000 for the hut and land, but said he rejected it because the developer wanted to flatten the hut - an idea he is firmly against

Historic: Mr Burns believes the shack, which contains an original coal fireplace, is around 100 years old and used to be located on the site of East Haven railway station which was demolished in the Sixties

'Everyone knows the hut and I would like to have it kept so am looking for a buyer willing to do something with it.

'It's still got the original coal fireplace inside. The roof does need replacing, as do a couple of the sleepers, but its a perfectly usable hut as it is.

'All that would be needed is a little time and not much money to have it back to is former glory.'

The hut used to be located on the site of the East Haven railway station near to where the trains used to pull over to load up fish from the village to take to markets across the country.

According to Mr Burns, there are still sleepers set into the ground around the hut showing where the tracks used to be. 

The station was first opened in 1838 and continued operating until 1967, when it was demolished in the wake of the Beeching Report.
