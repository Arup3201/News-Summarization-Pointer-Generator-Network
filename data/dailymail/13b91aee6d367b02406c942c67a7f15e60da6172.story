A police officer has been arrested on suspicion of leaking information to the media during the 'Plebgate' affair which forced the Government's chief whip Andrew Mitchell to resign.

The Metropolitan Police said the 46-year-old PC, from the Diplomatic Protection Group unit which guards Downing Street, was arrested at his workplace in central London today on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.

A statement said he was not one of the officers present during the incident when Andrew Mitchell rowed with officers who would not open the gates of Downing Street to let him ride out on his bicycle.

But the officer is suspected of disclosing information to the media without authorisation.

He was taken to a London police station where he remains in custody.

Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe had promised that charges would be brought in the case by the end of January.

He said he hoped to hand a file to prosecutors in a matter of weeks.

Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was forced to quit his Cabinet post amid a storm of protest - fuelled by the Police Federation - over claims he called officers 'plebs' during an altercation in Downing Street.

But new evidence has since emerged raising question marks over what happened and the Federation launched an internal review.

Investigators have taken statements from all 800 officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) as part of the inquiry.

Fresh evidence, including this CCTV evidence, has emerged since the row which has raised questions about what really happened

A 52-year-old PC, also in the Diplomatic Protection Group, and a 23-year-old man are currently on bail after being arrested as part of the investigation, codenamed Operation Alice.

Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), who continue to supervise the investigation, has been informed.

In a statement issued this afternoon the force said: 'We continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service but because of on-going developments no formal submission of an interim report has been made to them at this stage.

'The allegations in relation to this matter are extremely serious and it is therefore vital that a thorough and proportionate investigation is carried out.

'The investigation continues to be progressed with urgency, determination and an open mind.'

Separate to today's arrest and the other two previous arrests, four police constables in the Diplomatic Protection Group have been issued with Regulation 15 notices. These were issued in late December and early January. Three have been placed on restricted duty.

A Regulation 15 is a notice served on an officer when there is an allegation made that their conduct may have breached the standards of professional behaviour and that there will be an investigation into the circumstances.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
