Would you trust a knife-wielding robot to come just inches away from you?

That’s exactly what one Cornell University professor did when he attempted to train a robot on a supermarket checkout.

A video released by the New York-based research team shows the knife coming dangerously close to Professor Ashutosh Saxena’s body.

Professor Saxena understandably lurches away from the naked blade as its thrashed around by the semi-autonomous machine, named Baxter.

Scroll down for video...

The researchers at Cornell attempted to teach their knife-happy robot by gentle guiding its arms into the correct position (shown in green) and highlighting incorrect positions (shown in red)

By gently guiding its arms, the robot eventually learns that stabbing is wrong and is taught how to handle the knife correctly.

The learning technique, according to Professor Saxena, could mean that robots could soon be trusted with delicate or dangerous objects such as knives.

‘I think co-robotic environments such as warehouses and grocery checkout robots will be available in few years,’ Professor Saxena said in an interview with MailOnline.

Today robots are reaching new levels of intelligence by being able to process information faster than ever before.

The researchers at Cornell attempted to teach their knife-happy robot using something called a ‘coactive learning technique’.

This means that through a process of trial and error and gentle nudging, the robot could learn exactly what it had to do.

As the robot executes its movements, researchers  intervene, manually guiding the arms to fine-tune the trajectory.

The learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally, refining its trajectory a little more each time.

But bizarrely, tasks that most humans find easy, such as balancing a plate full of food or moving a glass of water, are still difficult for robots to learn.

The researchers at Cornell attempted to teach their knife-happy robot using something called a ‘coactive learning technique’.

This means that through a process of trial and error and gentle nudging, the robot could learn exactly what it had to do.

Baxter’s arms have two elbows and a rotating wrist, so it’s not always obvious to a human operator how best to move the arms.

To deal with this, the robot displays three possible trajectories on a touch screen where the operator can select the one that looks best.

As the robot executes its movements, researchers can intervene, manually guiding the arms to fine-tune the trajectory.

The learning algorithm the researchers provided allows the robot to learn incrementally, refining its trajectory a little more each time.

Cornell University engineers have taught a robot to work in a mock-supermarket checkout line, modifying a Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics in Boston to 'coactively learn'

‘This research allows the robot to plan its motions appropriately in new circumstances,’ said Cornell University’s Professor Ashutosh Siena told MailOnline.

‘One of the challenges was incorporating user's feedback, which was not correct all the time, and developing a learning algorithm that can learn despite such weak user feedback.

‘Our new algorithm allows learning from intuitive and easy feedback given by non-expert users.

The robot learns to associate a particular trajectory with each type of object. A quick flip over might be the fastest way to move a cereal box, but that wouldn't work with a carton of eggs

As well as handling knives, the Cornell researchers taught Baxter to carry cartons full of eggs without breaking them.

The robot learns to associate a particular trajectory with each type of object.

A quick flip over might be the fastest way to move a cereal box, but that wouldn’t work with a carton of eggs.

Also, since eggs are fragile, the robot is taught that they shouldn’t be lifted far above the counter.

The researchers claim that their technique could one day turn fumbling robots into effective everyday servant.

The work, funded by the U.S. Army Research Office, Microsoft the National Science Foundation, will be presented in detail in December.
