A Champagne price war has been triggered with Tesco slashing the price of one award winning brand to just £8.

Britain’s biggest grocer and drinks retailer has reduced its Louis Delaunay champagne by some 70per cent from the official list figure of £25.99.

The champagne is now cheaper than many supposedly inferior sparkling wines such as Prosecco from Italy and Cava from Spain.

Historically, supermarkets have used bread, milk and baked beans as loss leaders to tempt shoppers through the doors, however Tesco has taken the challenge to the luxury end of the shopping list.

The £8 price tag appears to be lowest price charged for a big brand champagne, produced according to the rules a heritage of the renowned wine region, for at least 10 years.

It represents a serious challenge to the rest of the high street, particularly Aldi and Lidl, who are thriving on the back of an image of providing luxury products at affordable prices.

Currently, the cheapest champagne from Aldi is its Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut  at £9.99, while Lidl offers the Comte de Senneval champagne at £11.99.

On the face of it Tesco’s Louise Delaunay is a quality product. The drink, which comes from the town of Dizy, in the Champagne region of France, is described as having strong floral aromas and an elegant citrus flavour.

This summer it won a bronze medal in blind taste tests at International Wine & Spirit Competition – an event considered the Oscars for the wine and champagne industry.

It is produced from a combination of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay by the champagne maker Les Roches Blanches.

The move by Tesco is timed to win vital Christmas shoppers, however it also taps into the fact that a growing number of people are regularly drinking champagne at home rather than just on special occasions.

Industry figures show sales of sparkling wine rose by five per cent in terms of volume and 14.8per cent in value in the past year, as people traded up from cheap Cava to more expensive Prosecco and Champagne.

Sales of sparkling wine were up by £70million to some £541million with more than 40per cent of people saying they had bought bubbly in the past year.

Kevan Mulcahey, head of alcohol at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘Shoppers are looking for something a bit special to treat themselves, and sparkling wine is a luxury product with an affordable price tag.

‘Shoppers are trading up from Cava to Prosecco and Prosecco to Champagne, boosting sales of sparkling wine by 14.8per cent compared with the same time last year.

‘Motivations for sparkling wine occasions have become more about ‘having a laugh’.’

Tesco champagne buyer Charlie Craven said: ‘This is a quality, award winning champagne and to find something this good for £8 on British high streets you’d have to go back at least 10 years.

‘We’re delighted that we can bring this to our customers at such a fantastic price.’

While the official list price is £25.99, Tesco has been selling it recently at half price of £12.99 and it is now going even further to undercut mainstream rivals such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Currently, Asda cheapest champagne is Pierre Darcys, which the company has cut from £24.25 to £10. Sainsbury’s Henry Dumanois Champagne Brut is down by £4 to £12, while Morrisons Champagne Gartissier Brut Nv is £13.99.

A recent survey published by Which? chose Sainsbury’s Blanc de Blanc Brut Champagne at £22.50 a bottle as the best choice alongside Piper Heidsieck Brut Champagne at £33.

The best Prosecco came from a Co-op own label at £9.99 with the judges praising its balance of bitterness and fruitiness.

The price cut by Tesco appears to be a direct response to Asda cutting its Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to £10.

Asda promoted its £10 deal by recreating a magazine front cover featuring reality TV star Kim Kardashian that went viral online when she vowed to ‘break the internet’.

In the Asda mock-up a model balances a glass on her rear, while Champagne shoots over her head to fill it, as the tagline reads: ‘Don’t break the budget: Pierre Darcys’.
