The seedy Melbourne hotel that was the scene of an alleged brutal sex attack by a self-proclaimed vampire gigolo has been bought up by The Block.

Nine Network bought the Hotel Saville at South Yarra in Melbourne's south-east for $7 million for its popular reality renovation series, according to the Property Observer which claims to have seen sale documents.

A Nine Network spokesman would not confirm whether or not the network had snapped up the property for the show.

The hotel is rumoured to have been bought by popular renovation television series, The Block

But the Property Observer claims the hotel, which features eight floors with 34 apartments, was bought for $6.25 million while the nearby car park used by the hotel was purchased for $1.1 million.

The octagonal building features 360 degree views and sits on 940 square metres of land.

However, the unique building is infamous for being the scene of male prostitute Shane Chartres-Abbott's alleged attack on a former client in August 2002.

He allegedly raped the woman and bit off part of her tongue.

The victim was found unconscious in the Melbourne hotel room, bloodied and beaten, with cuts, burns and bite marks covering her body and a chunk of her tongue missing. A police officer described it as one of the most brutal rapes he had seen.

During the trial, the court heard that Chartres-Abbott had told his alleged victim that he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was older than the city of Melbourne.

He was gunned down in his front yard as his girlfriend looked on in 2003. 

Mark Adrian Perry, Warren Shea and Evangelos Goussis were acquitted of orchestrating his murder in the Victorian Supreme Court in July this year.

Built in the 70s, the Hotel Saville was mostly used, in more recent years, by family members visiting patients in the closely located Prince Alfred Hospital.

Recent reviews from January and February this year on Trip Advisor, describe the rooms as being 'cheap, dingy, dodgy' and 'dirty' with a lot of noise from the outer streets. 

The next series of The Block to air this year is being filmed in Prahran.
