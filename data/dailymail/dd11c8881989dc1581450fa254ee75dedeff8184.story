A teenager who is 'allergic to life' fears she may not be able to fulfill her dream of finishing college because she has been struck down with illness.

Brianie Copeland suffers severe reactions to dust, eggs, pets and manmade fibres.

But the 17-year-old has always battled her condition and never let it hold her back, as she aimed for a career in childcare.

Brianie Copeland suffers severe reactions to dust, eggs, pets and manmade fibres.  But the 17-year-old has always battled her condition and never let it hold her back, as she aimed for a career in childcare

She fought from a young age - with the help of her mother Pamela Donnelly, 40 - to control the conditions which cause her skin to painfully blister and her chest to tighten.

Brianie, who lives with her family in Bearpark, County Durham, completed her GCSEs before leaving for college to complete a childcare qualification.

But despite being on track to gain the grade she needs,  the teenager’s future education has been thrown into doubt after her allergies worsened over the festive period.

The time Brianie’s had to take off ill has meant she’s fallen behind with her work placement risking her placement at New College Durham where she’s been studying.

Her mother said: 'Brianie has a host of allergies which means she needs special support.

'She has tried to go to her work placement in a nursery only to be told once there that she cannot work with young children when she is ill. What is she meant to do?

On a constant concoction of tablets and creams Brianie has to check what she can and can't come into contact with in case she suffers a reaction

'She has always been so determined and given 100% so to see her knocked back like this is awful. She has extra needs to other students that should be taken seriously. The other day she told me she didn’t want children when she is older in case they are like her.

'It was just heartbreaking to hear.'

On a constant concoction of tablets and creams Brianie has to check what she can and can’t come into contact with in case she suffers a reaction.

Unlike most teenage girls she’s unable to wear makeup, can’t use hair products and has to constantly monitor what she eats.

Her family believe her condition has been heightened since she suffered an asthma attack while at college.

A spokesman for New College Durham was not available for comment.
