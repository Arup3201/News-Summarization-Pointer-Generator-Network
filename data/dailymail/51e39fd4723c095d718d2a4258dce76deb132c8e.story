Long-jumper Chris Tomlinson tore his hamstring as Great Britain and Northern Ireland lost out to Germany in the Sainsbury's Glasgow International Match.

The 33-year-old suffered a huge blow in his first jump of the season and there was more disappointment to follow for Britain as Tomlinson's fellow Teessider, world indoor champion Richard Kilty, was disqualified from the 60 metres for a false start.

Britain trailed in third place going into the final four events of 16 at the Emirates Arena and a double relay win and Jessica Judd's comfortable 1500m triumph proved insufficient to claim the prize.

But there was some late drama as France's celebrations were cut short when they were disqualified from the final event, the men's 4x400m relay, to see them edged out in the four-team tournament by Germany.

The Germans finished with 50 points, one ahead of Britain and France, with a young Scotland team trailing on 35 points.

Britain's Kelly Massey, Serita Solomon and Chris Kandu all set personal bests to record victories as Britain took six of the 16 events while Scotland captain Jamie Bowie secured the sole home triumph.

But the British disappointment in finishing second was compounded by a terrible day for Tomlinson.

The former world indoor silver medallist still managed to finish second behind leapt Germany's Julian Howard after posting a first jump of 7.61 metres. But it came at a huge cost.

'I basically tore my hamstring from my take-off leg,' he said. 'It's a great shame really because I was in decent shape but I still finished second.

'But that's the way it goes unfortunately. My indoor season is definitely over now.'
