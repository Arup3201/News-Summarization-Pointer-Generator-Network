The heroic 15-year-old lone survivor of the Texas shooting spree that wiped out her family earlier this week paid a visit to a community event in her hometown Saturday, just hours after being released from the hospital. 

Cassidy Stay, 15, was discharged from Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital Friday in good condition after being treated for minor injuries. 

The teenager survived the Wednesday shooting that claimed the lives of both her parents and all four siblings by playing dead after a bullet grazed her head.

Cassidy has been hailed a hero or having the presence of mind to call 911 and alert police that the shooter, Ronald Haskell, may be planning to kill her grandparents.

On Saturday, Cassidy and her grandfather Robert Lyon attended a celebration of life organized in Spring to remember their slain loved ones. 

After taking a deep breath, a smiling Cassidy mounted the stage to address more than 400 people who came out to pay tribute to her parents and siblings, as seen in a video of the event recorded by Click2Houston.

The 15-year-old began by thanking those people who have been praying for her and the entire Stay family, and the first responders and medical personnel who took care of her.

With her voice slightly cracking, Cassidy said: 'I'm feeling a lot better and I'm on a very straightforward path to a full recovery.'

Before continuing her prepared remarks, the brave young woman drew another deep breath and then proceeded to quote from one of her favorite books in the Harry Potter series.

'In the Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore says, “Happiness can be found even in the darkest times if one only remembers to turn on the light,”’ she told the audience, wiping away tears.

In a voice filled with emotion, Cassidy Stay then told those in attendance she is certain that she and her family will be reunited someday.

'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca, and Zach are in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day,' she said.

Cassidy then flashed a smile and exclaimed, 'Stay Strong,' which has become a rallying cry for the girl's family and the Spring community.

Before the event at Lemm Elementary School, Cassidy helped release 600 colorful balloons into the air - 100 for each slain member of her family.

Those who wish to help with the victims' final expenses and Cassidy's medical bills can do so by donating money to the Cassidy Stay Fund on GoFundMe.com. So far, more than 4,300 people have given just shy of 216,000. The goal now is to raise $300,000.

Before she addressed the crowd, Cassidy was introduced by her grandfather, Robert Lyons, who credited his courageous granddaughter with saving his life and possibly the lives of many others.

'Without her courage and quick thinking, we might be mourning the deaths of 20, yes, I said 20, people today, including myself and nearly all of our children and grandchildren,’ Mr Lyon said.

The grandfather then recalled a conversation he had with Cassidy in the hospital, where the teenager told him that she felt like the angels of whom she has learned in Sunday school were with her Wednesday, putting their hands on her mouth and whispering her to stay still. 

'I was quiet when I needed to be quiet,’ Lyon quoted her as saying. 

Katie 
Stay, 34, her husband, Stephen, 39, and four of their five children 
between the ages of 4 and 14 were shot dead in their suburban Houston 
home on Wednesday.

Ronald Haskell, 33, has been charged with capital murder in connection to the massacre.

During his first court appearance Friday, a disheveled-looking Haskell with handcuffs on his wrists collapsed in twice as a prosecutor read out details of the crime.

The heavyset man had to be lifted into a wheelchair and removed from the courtroom.

Authorities
 have said Haskell was searching for his ex-wife, Katie Stay's sister, 
Melanie, when he came to the Stays' home in Spring.

He tied up
 the family and put them face-down on the floor before shooting each in 
the back of the head, according to investigators. The family had refused
 to say where Haskell could find his ex-wife.

Investigators
 have said that Cassidy Stay suffered a skull fracture from a bullet 
graze but survived by playing dead to call 911 and warn police that 
Haskell planned to shoot other relatives.

Haskell was eventually cornered in front of the home of Cassidy's grandparents and taken into custody.

Al
 Barker, the lawyer who represented Melanie Lyon in her divorce from 
Haskell, has revealed to MailOnline that Haskell's ex-wife believes 
their split after 11 torturous years of marriage was to blame for the tragedy.

The attorney relayed a conversation he had this week with Melanie's mother, who told him that after learning the news of her sister and nephews' deaths her daughter said: 'She had to pay the ultimate price for freedom.'

Those who knew the Haskells have said that the couple had a rocky marriage, and that Melanie was desperate to get away from her husband who allegedly beat her in front of their children. 

Haskell pleaded guilty to simple assault in a domestic violence-related incident in 2008, according to Utah state court records.

Court documents show that both Hasekll's mother and sister had requested restraining orders against him following domestic violence incidents that took place in November 2013 and as recently as last week.
