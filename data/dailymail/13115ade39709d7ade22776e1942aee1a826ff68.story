Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, classmates and others paid tribute 
Monday to a slain Connecticut teenager, saying she lived a remarkable 
life and imploring others to learn from her example.

Malloy 
called Maren Sanchez a star, saying she was inclusive, kind, talented 
and giving. He said she accomplished so much in a short period of time 
and affected so many.

'She was someone who moved people,' Malloy said. 'If you look at this crowd, you might even imagine she moved mountains.'

Embrace: Friends of Maren Sanchez hug during a vigil for the popular 16-year-old student who allegedly was murdered by a classmate last week

Vigil: Fellow students and members of the community gathered at Jonathan Law High School on Monday

Students, faculty members and members of the community released balloons in honor of Sanchez

The
 16-year-old was stabbed to death Friday morning inside the high school,
 just hours before she was to attend her junior prom with her boyfriend.

Malloy
 spoke at an outdoor vigil at Jonathan Law High School Monday night that
 featured the release of purple balloons, Sanchez's favorite color, and 
songs in her memory. Other speakers implored the crowd to live like she 
did.

'It's just really heartbreaking to see something Iike this 
happen in your hometown, especially to a place you loved,' said Amanda 
Awwad, 19, of Milford, who graduated from the school two years ago and 
dropped off flowers at a memorial in front of the school Monday.

Tears: Many at Monday's vigil for Sanchez were driven to tears remembering the girl described as 'the epitome of a good kid'

Somber: Sanchez was described by a teacher as 'one of those kids you want every kid to be like her'

The
 memorial started with a large rock spray-painted purple, with her first
 name, birth date and a heart painted in white. It grew to include 
flowers, stuffed animals, balloons, candles and notes. Purple ribbons 
were tied around trees by the school. People also were dressed in purple
 as they visited the site.

Police and the suspect's defense 
attorneys have declined to identify the teen charged with murder, but 
people who saw him taken into custody said he was Sanchez's friend, 
Chris Plaskon, who also was a junior.

The case was expected to go
 before a Juvenile Court judge in New Haven on Monday, but it's not 
clear whether that happened. Ansonia-Milford State's Attorney Kevin 
Lawlor, Plaskon's lawyers, and a spokesman for the Chief State's 
Attorney's Office all said they wouldn't be releasing any information 
Monday.

Under state law, murder cases involving 16- and 
17-year-old defendants are automatically transferred from Juvenile Court
 to adult Superior Court. It's not clear when that will happen.

Heartbreaking: Maren Sanchez, 16, was fatally stabbed in the neck by a fellow Jonathan Law High School student this morning, hours before she was due to attend her junior prom (pictured wearing her prom gown)

Held: Chris Plaskon (pictured in an undated photo) is under police supervision as he undergoes a medical evaluation

Apartment: The alleged attacker lives in an apartment in this complex in Milford, Connecticut with his parents and three brothers

One of Plaskon's lawyers, Richard Meehan, said his client is being held in a hospital under psychiatric evaluation.

Sanchez
 was a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and 
other school activities. Police said they're investigating whether the 
motive was Sanchez's refusal to be the prom date of the boy who was 
arrested.

Michael Mele, the school's drama director, said Sanchez
 was enthusiastic and upbeat with an infectious smile. She was involved 
in a show 'Little Shop of Horrors' that will now open Friday dedicated 
to her memory.

New relationship: Sanchez (left) had been dating Jarrod Butts (right) for about a month and a half at the time she was killed

Connected: Tyler Curtin (left, in the white shirt), Jarrod Butts (crouching in a green shirt) and Chris Plaskon (right, showing a thumbs up sign) were all on the same football team freshman year but have since grown apart

'She was just was the epitome of a good kid,' Mele said. 'She's one of those kids you want every kid to be like her.'

Rev.
 Cynthia Knapp, of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, said Sanchez was kind 
and compassionate to everyone as well as talented and had a contagious 
laugh. She urged the crowd to honor her memory by responding with 
forgiveness and compassion.

'Chris was her friend and I'm sure she already has forgiven him,' she said. 'Give us the courage to do the same.'

Center of the group: Maren's boyfriend Jarrod Butts holds up the dress that Maren planned to wear to their junior prom when friends gathered in her honor on Friday at the beach on the night that was meant to be their prom

Different duty: Maren's junior prom date Jarrod Butts was seen bringing the dress she was so eager to wear to the beachside memorial service held Friday night (left) and he was wearing a matching vest (right)

Emotional: Butts posted this message to his Twitter account on Friday

Heartbreaking: Maren was fatally stabbed on Friday morning by a boy who reportedly asked her to prom

Too soon: Maren had been looking forward to 
going to the junior prom with her hockey star boyfriend, and another 
boy- who she reportedly knew since middle school- asked her and she said
 no

Excited: Maren's drama teacher said that she had left rehearsals early on Thursday in order to get a manicure ahead of the big prom on Friday night
