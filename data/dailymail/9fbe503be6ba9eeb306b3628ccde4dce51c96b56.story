It is one of football's most iconic images - Diego Maradona taking on the Belgians as he tried to conquer the world.

Such was the danger Maradona posed to the Belgian goal during this Group 3 match in Barcelona during the 1982 World Cup, it seems they've put six men on him.

But all is not what it seems. The photograph is wonderful - Maradona in his pomp, unafraid to take on all-comers - but it is rather misleading.

Iconic: The famous photograph of Diego Maradona appearing to take on half the Belgian team at the 1982 World Cup

JUNE 13, 1982 - FIFA WORLD CUP, GROUP 3NOU CAMP, BARCELONA (ATT: 95,000)

Argentina: Fillol, Galvan, Olguin, Passarella (c), Tarantini, Ardiles, Bertoni, Gallego, Maradona, Diaz (Valdano 63), Kempes

Belgium: Pfaff, Gerets (c), Millecamps, Baecke, De Schrijver, Vercauteren, Coeck, Ceulemans, Vandersmissen, Vandenburgh, Czerniatynski

Scorer: Vandenburgh 62

The Belgian rearguard action is not Maradona's markers, it is actually a defensive wall to an Argentinean free-kick that has splintered.

We are less than a minute into the second half at the Nou Camp, the score is still goalless and Maradona has won his team a free-kick, with Luc Millecamps earning himself a yellow card for the foul.

It's too far out to attempt a shot but Ossie Ardiles has the chance to put the ball into a dangerous area. Maradona lurks 10 yards away from the wall and the video of the moment shows them frantically gesturing for someone to pick up the dangerman.

Ardiles takes a short free-kick to Maradona and it's at this point the wall breaks up and starts to hunt down the ball.

On the attack: Diego Maradona carries the ball forward into the Belgian half as Argentina search for the breakthrough in their opening match of the 1982 World Cup

Tripped: Maradona is brought to ground by the Belgian defender Luc Millecamps, prompting referee Vojtech Christov to award a free-kick

In the book: The referee also booked Millecamps for the foul, barely a minute into the second half

Mark him! Players in the Belgian wall frantically urge one of their colleagues to mark Maradona, who is stood about 10 yards away from the wall as Ossie Ardiles prepares to take the free-kick

Rolling ball: Ardiles strokes the ball to Maradona, who has still not been picked up

The moment: As Maradona takes in the ball with his left foot, the wall splinters and looks towards him. It is at this point the famous photograph is taken

The famous photograph is taken just as Maradona cushions the ball with his left foot, the eyes of the six players in the wall all trained towards him.

It is taken in the split second before Ardiles runs through the cluster of Belgian players because no other Argentine players are in shot.

Maradona tries to return the ball to Ardiles but the danger is snuffed out by the alert Millecamps.

Nowhere to go: Maradona tries to pick a pass to Ardiles, who has run through the cluster of Belgian players

Snuffed out: But Maradona is unable to find a teammate and the swarming Belgian defence manage to clear the ball

Cleared: The danger passes as Belgium get the ball away. They go on to win the match 1-0

Tight squeeze: Lionel Messi surrounded by six South Korean players at the 2010 World Cup in an echo of the famous Maradona photo

So this spectacular photograph is a trick. The perfect angle and the perfect timing to show one of the greatest ever players at his swaggering best.

Belgium went on to win the match 1-0, Erwin Vandenbergh scoring the winner on 62 minutes. Both advanced from the group.

They are set to meet again in Brasilia in the quarter-finals of the World Cup on Saturday, with Lionel Messi playing the role of Maradona.
