Stuart Kerner is accused of having sex with a 15-year-old pupil at Bexleyheath Academy in London, and friends of the girl said they warned police about the affair who said the pupil needed to complain 

Friends of a 15-year-old girl who was allegedly having sex with her vice principal warned police about the affair but were told by officers they were powerless to act unless the girl complained herself, a court heard.

Religious studies teacher Stuart Kerner, 44, allegedly had a secret relationship with the 15-year-old girl at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London. 

The married teacher is accused of having sex with the child in broom cupboards and locked offices across the school. 

The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told her friends she had had a relationship with the married teacher.

Inner London Crown Court heard that a friend went with two others to police because they were concerned the teenager might be in danger, or that Kerner could do the same to someone else. 

Her friend told jurors: 'They said 'We can't do anything unless the actual person tells us about it'.

'We were going to go to the teachers about it, but we decided not to because we didn't think they would take it seriously because the police didn't.

'We were told by police there was nothing they could do. We thought, if they can't do anything no one else can help us.'

Officers said they were powerless to act unless the girl, who was said to be 'besotted' with Kerner, complained herself.

Police eventually intervened after the alleged affair was reported by the girl's relative. 

The court heard the pupil had a schoolgirl 'crush' on Kerner, who is said to have confided in her about his wife and children. 

Vanessa Morrison, Kerner's personal assistant at the school, said she believed the girl was obsessed with him and 'secretive', and would often follow the teacher around the school.

She told jurors: 'I think she was absolutely obsessed with him. She followed him around and wanted to find out where he was.

'There were times when you would go into his office and she would be sitting there on some pretence.'

Kerner is vice principal and a religious studies teacher at Bexleyheath Academy in south east London 

Kerner has denied the charges of having sex with a child, as well as abusing his position of trust with the girl

She said she spoke to other support staff about her concerns but did not feel it was 'her place' to tell senior teachers.

The court previously heard that Kerner and the girl allegedly had sex at his home. 

Jurors were told the affair was discovered when the girl’s mother looked at her phone and found ‘sexual material’ unrelated to the case. She challenged her daughter who revealed the relationship with her teacher, it was said.

Kerner, who always went to work in a smart three-piece suit, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child.

Kerner, from Aylesford, Kent, also denies six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.
