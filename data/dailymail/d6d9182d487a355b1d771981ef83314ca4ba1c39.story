A 19-year-old charity fundraiser hanged himself after suffering severe 'lows' which followed weekend-long cocaine and alcohol binges, an inquest heard.

A coroner called cocaine an 'evil of our society' after the mother of popular mechanic Dylan Jackson said she could think of no other reason for his death.

Bolton Coroners' Court heard Mr Jackson was a loving, upbeat teenager who ran the 12-mile Tough Mudder assault course two weeks before his death for military charity Help For Heroes.

Death: Teenage charity fundraiser Dylan Jackson hanged himself after suffering severe 'lows' from weekend-long cocaine and alcohol binges, an inquest heard. His parents said he had never showed signs of depression

He had also completed 10k runs with his stepfather Stephen Dwyer, who described him as 'my training partner and my soulmate'.

Following one weekend party in September, Mr Dwyer found his stepson's body in his garden shed in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, after phoning local hospitals in a desperate bid to find him.

Yesterday a coroner recorded an open verdict, but said cocaine and alcohol had a 'dangerous effect' on the teenager and  it would have caused 'impairment of judgement'.

The inquest heard Mr Jackson would stay out from Friday until Sunday visiting  friends' homes, pubs and nightclubs where he would drink and take cocaine.

On Monday mornings his parents said he would be a on a 'massive low' which could last for up to three days, and he would not want to go to his night shift job.

His mother Michaela Dwyer, 38, said she assumed her son was using cocaine around a year before he died.

Mr Jackson told her he was not taking drugs, despite text messages about them on his mobile phone.

'I knew it had been going on,' she told the inquest. 'He wasn't coming home all weekend, he was rough going to work on Monday.

'He would say he didn't want to go and I said "that's because you are taking drugs and it will make you feel like this".

'He did admit about two weeks before he died that he had some funny thoughts where he mentioned about one day when he stopped on a bridge and wanted to throw himself from the bridge.

'I told him how devastated we would be if he ever did anything like that.'

On the night before his death Mr Jackson was said by a friend to be 'dancing' and in 'good spirits' on a night out, and he talked of visiting Blackpool to see a DJ.

He then took a taxi back to the family home with friends, the inquest heard. His mother and stepfather were on a night away, but the noise disturbed his sister Bethany.

Mrs Dwyer said: 'I got a phone call from Bethany saying he had all his mates in.

'I asked him to get them out the house because his sister was due to get up for work the following day and didn't want to be disturbed. He said "I'm sorry" and that was the last thing he said to me.

'If he hadn't have been under the influence he wouldn't have harmed himself.'

Mr and Mrs Dwyer returned home on Saturday afternoon  to find Mr Jackson missing.

By 7pm the next day, he still was not home and the family frantically phoned local hospitals and  his friends in a bid to find him.

At around 11pm the same day, Mr Dwyer, a railway engineer, looked in his shed to find his stepson's body.

Toxicology tests showed Mr Jackson had cocaine in his system and was more than twice the drink drive limit at the time of his death.

His stepfather told the hearing: 'He would be down in himself after the weekend. It would affect him for about three days. He would be on a massive low.

'We loved him so much. He had everything to live for and I can't understand it.

Soulmates: Stephen Dwyer and his stepson. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict and said: 'Cocaine is one of the evils of our society, particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol'

'My view is that most teenagers go through periods where nothing is going right and for him to do that it had to be something else. It had to be a major comedown from some drug or something affecting his brain to make him do that.'

Coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict and said: 'Dylan's family believe, and I accept, he had everything to live for.

'He was a young man who committed himself to help others, particularly in raising money for those less fortunate than himself by going on runs for charity.

A Class A drug, cocaine is a powerful stimulant with short-lived effects.

This means it makes users feel confident, happy, hyper-alert and awake, leading some to appear arrogant or aggressive.

It raises the body’s temperature, makes the heart beat faster and reduces the appetite.

But many users experience a lengthy 'comedown' when the effects of the drug wear off. This crash can last for days after heavy use of the drug.

The effects are worse when cocaine is taken with alcohol, because the two drugs interact to product a toxic substance in the liver called cocaethylene.

This can increase the depressive effects of alcohol, making the reaction to  cocaine stronger and making the user more likely to be aggressive.

Cocaethylene also takes longer to flush out of the user's system than   alcohol or  cocaine, subjecting the heart and liver to a longer period of stress.

'It is important I pay testament to Dylan for those efforts he made largely of his own volition to raise money for those less fortunate than himself. He was a young man the family should be proud of.

'He was a young man who enjoyed socialising and going out with friends. He seemed to enjoy a drink and without knowing how or why he became involved with cocaine.

'Cocaine is one of the evils of our society, particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol. The risks and dangerous effects on the brains of young people and the judgement of young people is there to be seen in relation to the death of Dylan Jackson.

'He was already planning to go out with his friends the following week and had planned runs and was not someone who had indicated any intention to harm himself in the past when free of alcohol and drugs.

'He would have had impairment of judgement caused by alcohol and the dreadful effects of cocaine.

'Sometimes coroners are able to give stark warnings on the way it not only places lives in jeopardy and causes the deaths of young people but also the devastating effect to families and loved ones who have lost a young, vibrant and caring individual.

'Dylan was a caring young man who should remembered for his charitable intents and equally for the jeopardy he placed himself in by the use of cocaine.' 

After the hearing, Mr Dwyer said: 'It's such a tragedy losing such a wonderful person, me and his mum loved him so deeply.

'It basically shows the dangers of taking drugs and alcohol and what they can do to you. He is a massive loss to not only us but the community as a whole.

'I have lost my training partner, my best friend and my soul mate, in a way.' 

Mr Dwyer already plans to run this year's Tough Mudder and the Bupa 10k run in Manchester in his stepson's memory.
