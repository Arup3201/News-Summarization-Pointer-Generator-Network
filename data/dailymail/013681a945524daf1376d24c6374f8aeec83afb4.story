A father of two was battered to death in an unprovoked attack by a stranger 'hell bent' on looking for trouble.

Baker Andrew Boardman, 53, was visiting a friend’s flat when he was randomly confronted by Jason Brookes.

The attack lasted 20 minutes, during which Brookes, 23, stamped on the victim’s head, bludgeoned him with an iron bar and smashed a mirror over his head.

Det Chief Insp Pete Simm from Lancashire Police said: 'In all my years 
of service this was probably one of the most horrific, brutal and 
sustained assaults I have ever come across.'

Mr Boardman was taken to hospital but died later from multiple injuries.

Inquiries revealed the Mr Boardman had been in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' and that Brookes had been been involved in a string of fights while out drinking with his girlfriend in St Annes, Lancs.

Brookes was today starting a life sentence after admitting murder.

He must serve a minimum of 18 and a half years before being considered for parole.

The tragedy occurred on June 30 after Mr Boardman, described as a 'loving dad' had been asked to go to the flat to pick up property on behalf of a friend who lived there.

When Mr Boardman arrived at the flat, he found his friend was not at home but Brookes, who also knew the friend, was present with his girlfriend and a 'tussle' broke out.

Preston Crown Court was told neither Brookes nor his girlfriend knew who Mr Boardman was and the victim was set upon.

Police were called to the flat and found Mr Boardman unconscious with fatal injuries to his face and body.

DCI Pete Simm: 'On the night of Mr Boardman’s murder Jason Brookes had been out drinking with his girlfriend and had been involved in numerous confrontations with people in St Annes.

'He was intent on becoming embroiled in a fight that night and sadly Andrew was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was subjected to a violent and sustained attack in which he was beaten to death without any provocation.

'Brookes attacked Mr Boardman with three separate weapons as well as kicking, stamping on and punching him while unconscious and incapable of defending himself.

'Mr Boardman sadly died as a result of the appalling injuries inflicted upon him.

'Brookes’ horrified girlfriend witnessed this murder and her bravery in producing evidence was crucial to the case.'

Det Supt Paul Withers said: 'Brookes had been behaving in an aggressive manner through the course of the evening and was hell-bent on looking for trouble.

'He came across Mr Boardman and we know the end result. He was attacked 
in quite a brutal manner. I think it’s terrible and it could have been 
anybody.

'It was not some feud which had been going on for years, they had never come across each other before.'

Sentencing Brookes to life in jail, Judge Stuart Baker said: 'No sentence I can impose can undo the needless loss of life or minimise the distress and grief which Mr Boardman’s family have experienced.'

Mr Boardman is understood to have worked in the former Kembers bakery, on St Andrews Road South, St Annes, and lived in Lytham prior to splitting from his wife Eileen.

The couple had two children together Zoe, 25, and Sarah, 22.

In the immediate aftermath of the murder his heartbroken family released a statement which read: 'Andy spent the majority of his life in Lytham and worked as a baker in St Annes.

'He was recently divorced from Eileen and was a loving dad to Zoe, 25, and Sarah, 22. We are saddened by his sudden passing.'
