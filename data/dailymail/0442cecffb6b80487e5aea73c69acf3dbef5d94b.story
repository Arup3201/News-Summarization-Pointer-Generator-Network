Joanna Lumley has told teenagers that if they want to get ahead in life, they must not ‘be a servant’ to their mobile phone.

Addressing pupils at an exclusive £30,000-a-year girls’ school, Miss Lumley said it was essential to switch off the devices for at least an hour a day.

‘Don’t be a servant to your phone,’ she said. ‘If all you are doing is reacting to calls then you never develop. You need to have time to be free and for your heads to be free to think.’

Actress Joanna Lumley was the special guest for Speech Day at Westonbirt School in Tetbury

The 67-year-old actress also told  
the pupils at Westonbirt School, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, that 
periods of unemployment should be avoided at all costs, even if it meant
taking a job they did not want.

‘You must swear never to go on  the 
dole. Find something to do,’  she said. ‘By doing, you become 
employable. It doesn’t matter what the job is. By working, you learn new
things, meet new people and are exposed to new ideas.’

Miss Lumley also urged the 11- to 
18-year-olds not to obsess about perfect exam grades – although that 
might not go down so well with fee-paying parents at the school, whose 
former pupils include artist Anna Hornby.

The school in Gloucestershire was treated to a speech by the hilarious, no-nonsense high-achiever

‘No one has ever asked me what grades
I made,’ said the Absolutely Fabulous star, whose acting career dates 
back to the Sixties.

She did recommend making use of 
Westonbirt’s business school, however, saying: ‘[It] will help you learn
to be streetwise and savvy. That’s the best kind of clever’.

She added: ‘Be beautiful, be brave, be kind, be clever, be happy.’

Miss Lumley is becoming notorious for
her disdain for the mobile. She claims rarely to use hers, saying last 
year: ‘I cannot stand it. It’s a waste of life.’ She has also criticised
mothers who talk on mobiles instead of interacting with their babies, 
and declared letters ‘lovelier’ than a ‘crackly voicemail message’.

'The business school will help you learn to be streetwise and savvy. That's the best kind of clever'

Miss Lumley, who attended St Mary’s 
Convent School in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, as well as a 
finishing school, admitted she was not always a model pupil in her 
boarding days.

She revealed she secreted a pet mouse in the inside pocket of her blazer – and committed the cardinal sin of talking to boys.

The former model, who is due to 
appear in Martin Scorsese’s film The Wolf Of Wall Street, also advised 
pupils to stay active in adulthood. ‘Never be bored. Find something to 
do,’ she said, before adding: ‘And don’t yawn.’

Westonbirt head Natasha Dangerfield 
said of Miss Lumley’s visit for its speech day: ‘The girls loved her. 
She was gracious and entertaining, and we fully endorse her tips for the
girls.’
