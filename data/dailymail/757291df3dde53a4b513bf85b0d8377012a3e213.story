Britain’s biggest provider of laser eye surgery has been accused of using ‘hard sell’ tactics on its customers. 

The instructions for securing new patients for corrective treatment were uncovered in a confidential training booklet for staff at Optical Express. 

The guidelines, which were marked as confidential, reportedly encourage front-of-house patient advisers to ‘take control’ of possible customers when they come in.

And it urges staff to ‘look for a nugget’ from potential clients – a personal detail that can be shared with them at a later date.

‘If you can find that personal connection, you can refer to it later and share it with your optometrist. A good nugget can be the difference between a booker and a thinker,’ the instructions say, according to The Observer, which has seen the leaked document.

The guide suggests that if the potential customer is a ‘thinker’ they may need reassurance, the newspaper reports.

‘Face your patient, put the pen down, and look them in the eye,’ the instructions state, adding: ‘Use statements like: “What price can you put on your eyesight?”, “Remember you do this for the rest of your life”, ie Lifetime investment.’

Other instructions include briefing optometrists about the ‘type’ of patient they may end up operating on and to do so ‘out of sight and hearing of patient’. This briefing would include ‘things to avoid’ discussing with the patient, The Observer reports. 

It comes amid calls for tougher regulations of the industry including from the Labour MP John McDonnell.

The newspaper quotes Sasha Rodoy, a campaigner calling for tighter regulations, as saying: ‘These “hard sell” techniques may not be illegal, but they are totally inappropriate for a medical procedure and they should be illegal.’

According to nhs.uk, risks of laser eye surgery can include problems with dry eyes in the months after treatment while others can experience glare or halo effects when driving at night. But it adds that complications occur in less that five per cent of cases.  

On its website, Optical Express, founded in 1991, describes itself as ‘a world leader of selected healthcare services ranging from optical stores, laser clinics to a state-of-the-art medical hospital and cosmetic treatment centres.’

A spokesman said the manual was no longer in use and that patients seeking eye surgery must first attend a ‘highly detailed refractive consultation’ to determine if they are suitable candidates for treatment.

She told The Observer: ‘Each member of staff involved in the consultation process undergoes extensive training and development to ensure we deliver an outstanding patient experience and clinical outcome.

‘Our patient advisers help to put patients at ease and address any non-clinical concerns they may have while our qualified and highly experienced optometrists focus on clinical matters.’

The spokesman added that more than 99 per cent of patients achieved 20/20 vision or better without spectacles or contact lenses after surgery. This figure, the company says, was taken from a study of more than 293,000 patients with the most common prescription ranges the company treats.
