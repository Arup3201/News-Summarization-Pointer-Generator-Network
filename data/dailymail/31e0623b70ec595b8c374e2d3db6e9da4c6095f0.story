This is the moment a seven-year-old survivor of a deadly air strike in a dispute region of Ukraine was miraculously pulled from the rubble of an apartment block.

The boy, thought to be called Bogdan, can be seen trapped underneath layers of concrete and metal in the wreckage of a building in Snizhne, eastern Ukraine.

Rescue workers crowd round the boy and brace themselves against a huge lump of concrete before it is lifted away by a crane.

Buried: The boy, who seems to have been given a helmet for protection, was trapped beneath several tonnes of rubble for hours after the air strike

Survivor: The seven-year-old, named as Bogdan, was taken to hospital after the miraculous rescue

Bogdan is then carried away by one of the rescuers, put on a stretcher and carried away in an ambulance.

The strike was carried out against pro-Russian rebels, who accused the Ukrainian army of the bombing. Ukraine in turn seemed to blame the strike on Russia.

According to the Russian-backed news network Russia Today, the boy was discovered by rescuers in the city, who dug through the debris with shovels to clear a space for him to move.

Struggle: Reports told of rescuers and local residents working with shovels and their bare hands to shift debris left by the bombing of an apartment block

Heave: A group of emergency workers and locals brace themselves against a huge slab of concrete before it is lifted away by a crane

Ruin: This apartment block was devastated by a missile strike yesterday morning. A tax office building was also hit

Treatment: Bogdan was carried to a stretcher and taken away to hospital via ambulance

He was then given a torch so he could see, as well as water to drink, ahead of the eventual rescue. The news network said his father was there reassuring him throughout the ordeal.  

He was trapped under the debris following a bombing at around 6.30am yesterday, when a government building and a block of flats were hit by missiles from a bomber plane, killing at least 11 people.

Resident Igor Chernetsov lost his wife in the attack, and said: 'I heard an explosion, and suddenly I was thrown out of the apartment, out of the fourth floor.

'I woke up covered in dust and had no idea what had happened.'

Snizhne is in the disputed Donetsk region of Ukraine, which recently voted to secede from the rest of Ukraine by a huge margin - though the central government does not recognise the result and considers the territory its own.

Dispute: Rebel forces in Donetsk blame the Ukrainians, who in turn have cast suspicions on Russia

Tensions: The dispute comes as Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk was photographed inspecting military positions in recently-reclaimed Slaviansk

Rebels in the region have been fighting the Ukrainian army for weeks, and accused the government of launching the air strike.

Kiev denied rebel charges that the strike had been carried out by a Ukrainian warplane and said it was the work of an 'unknown' plane.

As the rebels have no aircraft of their own, response was apparently an accusation against Russia.

The rebels have been pushed back in recent weeks after losing the city of Slaviansk early in July.

They have now been forced to retreat to the main industrial city of Donetsk, though they also remain in control of the border town of Luhansk.

Donetsk, which had a pre-conflict population of about 900,000 people, has been steadily emptying as thousands, fearing a government offensive, have fled.

Once a bustling city, there are fewer and fewer people out on the streets and few cars. Most of the banks, shops and bars have closed, cash-dispensers have been switched off and street traffic lights no longer work.

Lyudmila, 35, who was leaving Donetsk, said: 'I have been forced to gather up my things and get away from this lawless, genocide, which is happening. I am simply saving my children. My husband is staying behind. I have left my home and my work. I am leaving to save my children.'

The fighting between government and rebel forces in Ukraine has claimed hundreds of lives so far. 

No reliable official death toll exists, but Ukrainian authorities have said that 258 servicemen have been killed in fighting and 922 injured.

European Union leaders are considering whether to toughen sanctions against Russia because of what they consider its destabilisation of neighbouring Ukraine.

Many of the 28 EU leaders coming into Brussels today agree that Russia is still failing to take sufficient measures to help ease the crisis in eastern Ukraine, where separatists want to break away in two regions.

Germany said Ukraine claims heavy weapons are still flowing to separatists across the Russian border and there are increasing attacks on Ukrainian forces from Russian territory.

EU diplomats are looking at new sanctions that would go beyond the current travel bans and assets freezes against individuals, but still fall short of full economic and trade sanctions.

The U.S. is considering imposing unilateral sanctions on Russia for its actions regarding Ukraine.
