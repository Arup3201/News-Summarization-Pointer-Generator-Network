Two teenage boys planning to change their identities that fled to an unknown destination in a Mercedes Benz after leaving notes for their parents saying they are 'sorry' and 'starting new lives' have been found safe in Colorado.

The parents of Jordan Webb, 16, and Levi 'David' Briggs, 15, had launched a frantic search for their sons, who they say fled from Avon, Indiana in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The boys' families told RTV6 that the teens were found at the home of a camp friend in Loma, Colorado and were safely with police.

They vanished after enjoying dinner 
on Friday night with Jordan's father, Russell, and had plans for the 
following day. But when Russell awoke, he found the boys - and his car -
 missing.

The boys - neither of whom has a driving license - were believed to have taken off in the 2006 black Mercedes C350
 at around 1 a.m. with clothes and backpacking equipment.

While their parents have not released details about what might have sparked their disappearances, Jordan's sister suggested her 'worldly' brother was frustrated in the small town.

Authorities issued a nationwide alert seeking Jordan and David, while the families set up Facebook and Twitter pages urging their sons to return.

On the pages, they said they believe the boys had taken off for Colorado or New York City with 'plans of changing their identities'.

Parents of the boys' friends agreed on Facebook that 'the word around school' was that the teenagers are going to New York.

The teenagers, who attend the same school, both got rid of their mobile phones and shut down their Facebook accounts, their parents said.

They added that, while the boys could
 be travelling in the Mercedes, there is also the possibility they were 
traveling by air, bus or train. It is not known how much money the boys 
took with them.

Jordan's mother told CNHI her son had written a letter in which he said he knew leaving 
was 'bizarre' but added that they planned to settle somewhere for a long
 time.

Jordan's sister, Jennifer, added to 
CNHI: 'We’re all very close. He stayed with me last weekend and seemed 
totally normal. Nothing seemed to be bothering him. We have a very close
 relationship.

'He’s very 
intelligent and worldly and I think Avon might not be his cup of tea. 
But we've always told him you can't pick where you go to high school, 
while you can pick any college you want.'

In a touching post on Facebook, David's father Paul appealed for his son to return home  - although neither of the families would go into detail about what sparked the boys' disappearances.

Missed: Jordan's parents said their son left without his glasses and the
 boys may change their appearances

'Intelligent': His sister, left, described him as 'wordly' and said he may have been frustrated in Avon

''Our world is upside down 
without you,' he wrote. 'We're not getting much sleep because we're always thinking 
about you. Come home. We'll get through whatever we have to, to get you 
back on track with a good future. You are worth it.

I miss your guitar playing. I look at 
the piano and can hear you playing in my pleasant memories of you. There
 are many more great memories to make. There isn't any valid reason you 
cannot come home. I love you. Dad.'

The Webbs added: 'Jordan is loved and 
missed by his family and friends. We cannot imagine life without our 
son, and we will not stop looking until he's home safe, no matter how 
long it takes.'

Authorities were following leads of possible sightings and were interviewing friends of the boys in hope of finding out their destination, Avon police chief Jack Miller told ABC News.

'One of the unique things about this is 
that these kids come from good homes, with loving parents, they mention 
in their notes that they love their parents, they were good in school, 
popular, there were no red flags,' he said.

Have you seen them? Police have sent a nationwide alert to look for the boys

'The boys each left a 
note and the notes basically said the same thing, that they were going 
to take this opportunity to strike out on their own.'

He added that the community had come together to try to locate the boys.

'We want the boys to know they are not 
in any kind of trouble. The police are involved not because of any crime
 but to facilitate their return home to their parents,' he said.

Webb is white, 6 feet
 tall, with light brown hair and blue eyes, while Briggs is described as
 white, 5 feet10 inches tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes.

The car has an Indiana license plate reading 32R14.
