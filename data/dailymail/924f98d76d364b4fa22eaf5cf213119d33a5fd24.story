A 
used-car salesman has been jailed for life for murdering his estranged wife,
their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family 
home after his marriage collapsed.

Danai
Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he 
killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching 
the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent.

Melissa’s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe 
burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 
last year and he died six days later.

Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court, told Iraqi-born Muhammadi that he will spend at least 38 years behind bars before being eligible for parole.

The court heard how Muhammadi
and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the 
letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out 
at the base of the stairs.

The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold.

As
smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Melissa 
collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters 
lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt.

Amid
the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, 
causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back 
inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape.

Her
husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following
his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But 
26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew 
the windows out.

He 
suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in 
East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in 
the intensive care unit. He died six days later.

Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts 
of murder. Muhammadi and Mahmud were both also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder.

Muhammadi’s
new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of 
murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts 
of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court.

The judge said that while she was not the principal figure, she was a 'joint perpetrator in the common venture to burn the house'.

Judge Sweeney said the actions of Muhammadi 'can truly be described as pure, selfish wickedness' - adding that Melissa Crook and Noah 's last moments, trapped by the flames, must have been 'of abject terror.

He said: 'No-one who heard the evidence in this case will ever forget Mrs Crook’s description of how, as he tried to escape, her husband became stuck in the bedroom window and how, unable to extricate himself, she had to stand and watch as his lower half was burned.

'It’s no thanks to you two that Amanda Crook and Bohdan Crook escaped the fate that you intended for them.

'Each suffered significant injuries, the effects - whether physical or mental - they are still clearly suffering from today.'

Mr Justice Sweeney acknowledged that Muhammadi was the 'principal offender', adding: 'The enterprise was all your idea and you drove it forward to its conclusion.'

He said that Mahmud’s actions were borne out of 'misguided friendship' with Muhammadi and his expectation of significant financial gain from him.

Mahmud was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years prison before being eligible for parole.

Muhammadi's girlfriend Smith showed no emotion as she was jailed for 14 years.

The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son

The judge told her: 'You joined the enterprise because you were the girlfriend of Danai Muhammadi.

'It was an on-off relationship in which, as I have already said when passing his sentence, he used you to get Melissa back.'

He added that like both Muhammadi and Mahmud, Smith had shown not 'a spark of genuine remorse' for her actions.

In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated.

Smith
had started a relationship with Mrs Crook’s estranged husband, Danai 
Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted Melissa
about their 'great life together'.

Smith also mocked Mrs Crook 
about her size, for being 'boring' in the bedroom and added: 'Enjoy your
life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.'

Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt 'sick' when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the 
fire that killed three generations of her family.

Mrs
Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her 
22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa’s brother - but both said the end of 
the court case would not bring them closure.

She said: 'We weren’t 
just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his 
wife and his own child and his father-in-law.

'He’s taken away our whole lives, just because of his greed, and that’s all it was. It was greed. There was no reason to do what he did.'
