An airline passenger was thrown off a flight after a fellow traveller reported him to cabin crew for writing the word 'terrorism' in his journal as they prepared to take off.

Oliver Buckworth was on a Gold Coast-bound Tigerair flight from Melbourne when a man in the seat behind him complained to a stewardess. About 10 minutes later Australian Federal Police officers boarded the flight and asked him to get off.

The drama was sparked when the 28-year-old scribbled a drawing of a distressed man and wrote the words 'terror is made up'.

An airline passenger was thrown off a flight after a fellow traveller reported him to cabin crew for writing the word 'terrorism' in his journal as they prepared to take off

The Melbourne interior designer, who was planning to visit family and friends in Byron Bay in northeastern NSW, had been scribbling down his thoughts in his journal on Saturday morning.

Above his drawing, he had also written: 'In a land of melting ice creams, sandy feet and fluffy bears, how can anyone be fearful of terrorism.' 

'I'm an inquisitive guy and I was just making light-hearted scribble about how everyone is getting so scared about terrorism again,' Mr Buckworth told Daily Mail Australia.

'Then I heard the guy behind me tap the stewardess and say "look what he's writing".

'So I turned around and told him that I was merely commenting on the mass fear of the Australian people.' 

Shortly after, he looked up only to be faced with three officers from the Australian Federal Police who ordered him to alight from the aircraft.

'It was an incredibly unjust situation,' Mr Buckworth said.

'I was afraid because no one was helping me and I was blamed purely from hearsay. 

'Nobody defended me on the plane as I looked around for sympathy.

'I guess they thought "there goes the baddie and pointed their finger at me".

But Mr Buckworth didn't leave without a fight.

As he was escorted off the plane, he tried to plead his innocence to the rest of the passengers on board by yelling: 'I'm not a criminal you've got the wrong guy'.

Once he was taken off the flight, police searched Mr Buckworth and agreed that he was indeed innocent.

'The police said I was free to go because I did nothing wrong but no further action was taken,' he said.

'When I asked them about a reimbursement for another flight, the police said it was matter for the airline.'

So after five hours worth of phone calls, an operator from Singapore Airlines-owned Tiger Airways informed Mr Buckworth that he had to submit an online form in order to gain a response regarding the matter.

'And to add salt to the wound, I was told that they [Tigerair] can't guarantee that I'll be able to get on another flight because I might be blacklisted,' he said.

Tigerair has confirmed it sought an AFP intervention after receiving a complaint about a disruptive passenger.

The airline had a policy of zero-tolerance in matters of safety, it also said in a statement.

'Safety and security of staff and passengers underpins the operation at all times and is never compromised,' a Tigerair spokesperson said.

'As per Tigerair's conditions of carriage, the airline may refuse passengers to travel for reasons of safety or security and this may include the enforcement of future travel bans.

'As the matter was dealt with by the AFP and is subject to further review by Tigerair, we are unable to comment further at this time.'

However a spokesman for AFP said 'no further action will be taken'.

'The AFP responded to a call for assistance from the airline and briefly spoke to the individual concerned,' the spokesman said.

'It is a matter for the airline.' 

Still, Mr Buckworth has received no word from Tigerair as concerns grow for both him and his family.

'My biggest  fear is this will cause a ripple effect with other airlines and now my family is paranoid that they'll be blacklisted too,' he said. 

'Especially because we have a particular surname – there aren't a lot of Buckworths out there.

'The pure irony of it all was that I was writing about the very subject of this fear in everyone about terror. So the whole situation is quite poignant and ridiculous.' 

The incident comes in light of the federal government's bid to step up security measures after increasing Australia's terrorism alert level to high.

On Thursday, at least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in anti-terror raids across Sydney and Brisbane, which has been declared as Australia's largest ever counter-terrorism operation.

Those who were arrested include Omarjan Azari, who was charged with a serious terrorism related offence for allegedly plotting to behead a member of the public in Martin Place, Sydney's CBD.
