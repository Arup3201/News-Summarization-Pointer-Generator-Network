It's the most prestigious tournament in ice hockey - so when you win it, there's only one way to celebrate.

Stanley Cup champions the Boston Bruins have toasted their 2011 victory with a staggering $156,679.74 bar bill at the MGM Grand in Mashantucket, Connecticut on Saturday night - and that wasn't even the full team, but just six of its apparently hardiest members.

However $56,679.74 of the tab went on the players working up the Dutch courage to make one final order that will go down in history: a $100,000 bottle of Ace of Spades Midas Champagne.

Getting my groove on: Brad Marchand shows he's got some moves off the ice also

There are just six of the 30-litre bottles in existence - well, five now.

Made by luxury brand Armand de Brignac and produced by Champagne house Cattier, it is the largest bottle of luxury Champagne in the world.

The gold metallic bottles are crafted entirely by hand, inspired by fashion designer Andre Courreges.

Debauchery: The players quickly ended up dancing on the bar Coyote Ugly-style. Right, the reason they thought that was OK - their bar tab

Each have two Ace of Spades insignias
 and four hand-applied pewter lables.

They are housed in a black wooden 
case, lined with velvet and fitted with an engraved nameplate.

Each is 
embossed with the Champagne's royal crest.

The bottle ordered by the Bruins was hand-delivered by Shrine owners Ed Kane, Joe Kane and Randy Greenstein.

And the losers: Rioters torched cars and looted shops in Vancouver after the city's Canucks lost the Stanley Cup Finals

Of course there was only one cup that was prestigious enough to drink such a drink from.

Thing of beauty: The Ace of Spades Midas Champagne bottle - one of which was ordered by the Bruins on Saturday night

His team mate Shawn Thornton, meanwhile, is pictured drinking straight from the gold bottle - which is so big that he needed assistance holding it up.

Images of the joyful, debauchery-filled celebration are in direct contrast to scenes pictured in defeated Vancouver last week.

The Canucks lost 4-0 to the Bruins in Game Seven of the tournament - sparking violent riots in the West Coast Canadian city.

Police squared off against angry youths who burned cars and destroyed store fronts in savage demonstrations last week.

A photograph of one couple lying on the ground kissing in the midst of the riots has become the iconic image of the violence after they declared they had been beaten by police.

But in Massachusetts there was nothing but joy. And despite hangovers that must have rivalled those portrayed in the Hangover II, the players still managed to make it to Fenway Park on Sunday to be honoured by the Boston Red Sox.

The MidasÂ  bottle was signed by every member of the team there - including Tim 
Thomas, Zdeno Chara, Patrice Bergeron, Milan Lucic, Brad Marchand and 
Shawn Thornton.

It will be on display at High Rollers and is set to be raffled off to benefit the Bruins foundation.

The first Midas bottle also sold for $100,000 at a casino - at the famous nightclub XS in the Encore casino in Las Vegas.

Most expensive drink purchase: Ace of Spade Midas champagne at $100,000

When they ordered the Midas: As their final act, after downing $56,679.74 of wine, liquor and beer (presumably making it seem like a very good idea at the time)

Least expensive drink purchase: Bud Light at $5 (but they ordered 136 of them... bringing the total just on Bud Lights to $680)

Proof they weren't afraid to mix their liquors: Tab included various 
different flavours of Bacardi rum, Patron tequila, Grey Goose vodka, 
Jack Daniels whiskey, Captain Morgan's Spiced rum, Hennessy, along with (of course) multiple beers and champagnes

Most popular drink: Bud Light (well, they are hockey players after all)

Least popular drink: Fiji water (just $268 of the total bar bill - but $268 wisely spent)

Service charges: An incredible $24,869.80
