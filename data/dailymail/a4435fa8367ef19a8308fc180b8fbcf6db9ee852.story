A former Virginia high school teacher who police say attacked the wife of a state legislator was indicted by a grand jury on Monday on three felony charges of entering a house armed, abduction and malicious wounding, according to court documents.

Police say Claire Ogilvie, 36, attacked Nancy Tramontin, the wife of David Toscano, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, in their Charlottesville home on Feb. 24 and struck the woman several times in the head.

Tramontin said in a statement released February 27 that she and Ogilvie were friends prior to the attack.

The legislator's wife said she met Ogilvie in 2010 at a program called Semester at Sea, which allows students to take college courses on a cruise ship, and ended the relationship in 2012.

On board, 'befriended Nancy and David's son, tutoring him during the voyage,' according to the statement.

'The Toscanos and Ms. Ogilvie became friends over the course of the voyage, and after they returned Claire moved to Charlottesville early in 2011,' her statement said. 'Nancy helped Ms. Ogilvie settle in, including her in family holidays, and community events and generally trying to welcome her to the community. She was part of the local fall 2010 Semester at Sea community.

Obsessed? Tramontin said in a statement she 'became concerned that Ms. Ogilvie had developed an unsettling interest in the Toscano family'

'In 2012, Nancy became concerned that Ms. Ogilvie had developed an unsettling interest in the Toscano family. The family reduced their contact, beginning in the early summer, and saw her for the last time in fall 2012. Before the attack, Nancy and the Toscanos had not seen Ms. Ogilvie in over a year.'

Ogilvie attended both Yale University and George Washington University Law school - and even competed on both 'Jeopardy!' and 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,' Roanoake.com reported. She also reportedly worked as a lawyer for Foley & Lardner.

Until her arrest, she was a teacher at William Monroe High School in Stanardsville, outside Charlottesville.

Ogilvie remains in jail without bond.

Ogilvie's next court date is set for Sept. 17 in Charlottesville Circuit Court.
