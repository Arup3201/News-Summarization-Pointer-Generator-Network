When it comes to capturing their big day on film, most people rely on the services of a professional wedding photographer.

But one couple from Plymouth, Devon, got a pleasant surprise when they realised their reception party had also been captured on Google Street View.

The bride, named on social media as Theresa Egan, can be seen stepping outside the Firkin Doghouse pub during her reception party, just as one of Google's street mapping cars drove past.

The wedding took place in August 2012 but may not stick around online for long, as Google says it usually updates street view images every three years.

Snapped: One couple had their wedding reception captured on Google Street View while standing outside The Firkin Doghouse in Plymouth

Big day: The bride, named on social media asÂ Theresa Egan can be seen outside the pub along with some of her guests after getting hitched

Celebration: A man pumps the air  while the new Mrs Egan enjoys the end of her special day with her guests in this August 2012 image

Mapped: Google uses cars such as this, with a camera and laser rig fitted on the top, to take panoramic views of the roads - but Mrs Egan's wedding might not be online for long as the tech company says it replaces the images roughly once every three years
