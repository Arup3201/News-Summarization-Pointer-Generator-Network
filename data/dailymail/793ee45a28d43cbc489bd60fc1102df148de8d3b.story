Police have arrested the man they believe gunned down registered nurse Gale Sikora and her Miami Dade College student son Anthony Sikora in a deadly confrontation Thursday.

Ronnie Candelaria, 21, faces two counts of first-degree murder and armed robbery.

Police say Candelaria confessed to them that he was driven to the murders by voices inside his head.

The found an AK-47 and a Glock handgun in his home.

A friend of Anthony Sikora, 23, police told the Miami Herald he attacked the Sikoras at 4:25 a.m. Monday after forcing himself into the house.

'It
 looks like he tried to shoot out the deadbolt to get in the front door,' Miami-Dade police detective Alvaro Zabaleta told reporters. 'He went to the side of the house and blew open the sliding glass door. 
Once inside, he continued shooting. He must have shot over 30 rounds.'

Candelaria lives with his parents about six blocks from the site of the murders.

Marcel de Vivo, 24, who is a close friend of Anthony Sikora, said Candelaria was a loner fascinated by guns and fond of intimidating people.

He added that months ago Sikora told his that he had a friend named Ronnie was 'freaking him out.'

'I told him that Ronnie was all talk,' deÂ Vivo said. 'This is unbelievable. It makes no sense.'

Sikora was described as a quiet student who generally kept to himself.

'He really 
didn't have that many people to talk to,' said Lance Gam, 19.

Mother Gale Sikora, 62, was a registered nurse at Baptist Hospital Miami.

The hospital's COO Randy Lee called her 'a wonderful employee.'

'Our hearts go out to Gale's family and colleagues,' he said.

The first reports Candelaria was a danger came in at roughly 4:30 a.m. when police radioed that a schizophrenic who had not taken his medication had stolen a car from the Candelaria home.

His parents had called 911 to report the theft.

Witnesses at the scene said they could hear terrifying bursts of gunfire coming from the home

Just minutes later, gunfire erupted from inside the Sikora's two-bedroom, two-floor stucco home.

One unidentified witness said she was terrified upon hearing the shots.

'I just heard the gun, then it stopped for one minute, and then I heard it again,' she said. 'I was too scared to come out.'

Police later found Candelaria in a white Toyota on Southwest 145th Ave. and 95th Street.

He was traveling with several weapons and dozens of rounds of ammunition.

Police say they do not believe the shootings were related to any domestic issue.
