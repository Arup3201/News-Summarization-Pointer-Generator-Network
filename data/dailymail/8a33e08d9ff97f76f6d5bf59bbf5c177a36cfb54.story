Veteran BBC football commentator Stuart Hall has admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls, the youngest aged nine.

Hall, 83, entered the guilty pleas last month at Preston Crown Court but they can only be revealed today after reporting restrictions were lifted. The sex offences took place between 1967 and 1986.

On BBC 5 Live he was a regular football commentator and summariser and provided colourful analysis of matches, often including literary references and allusions.

Despite previous vociferous public 
denials of any wrongdoing, Hall calmly and repeatedly answered 'guilty' 
when the charges were put to him at the hearing on April 16.

Sat in front of the dock with his 
legal representatives, he confirmed his full name of James Stuart Hall 
to the clerk in the plea hearing.

He then stood up as he uttered the single damning word which has now ruined his reputation.

The Recorder of Preston, Judge 
Anthony Russell QC, told him he would be required to sign the Sex 
Offenders Register. He was told a notice which he needed to fill in 
would be sent to his home in Cheshire within days.

An additional charge of rape and three more of indecent assault will lie on file after prosecutors decided not to pursue them following the other guilty pleas.

Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the North West, described the broadcaster as an 'opportunistic predator'.

A brief outline of the abuse suffered
by three of his victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was 
outlined at an earlier hearing at Preston Magistrates' Court.

In the 1980s Hall molested a nine-year-old girl by putting his hand up her clothing.

He also kissed a 13-year-old girl on the lips after he said to her: 'People need to show thanks in other ways.'

On another occasion in the 1970s he fondled the breast of a girl aged 16 or 17.

Hall was charged with those three offences on the same day as was arrested by Lancashire Constabulary on December 5 last year.

The BBC said at the time that the 
former It's A Knockout presenter would not work for the corporation until the matter was 
resolved.

He was subsequently charged with historic sex offences against 10 more girls and the rape of a 22-year-old woman.

Following those allegations, Hall 
read out a strident condemnation to reporters in which he labelled the 
claims as 'pernicious, callous, cruel and above all spurious'.

He said he had endured 'a living nightmare' and but for his 'very loving family' may have considered taking his own life.

BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: 'Stuart Hall pleads guilty to sex abuse ofÂ  girls as young as 9. Utterly nauseating!

'Always admired Hall as a broadcaster. Worked with him on occasions. This is just too ghastly!'

Hall has been a familiar face and 
voice in British broadcasting for half a century and was awarded an OBE 
in the 2012 New Year Honours.

As well as his work on 5 Live and It's A Knockout, he also wrote a weekly sport column for the Radio Times magazine up until his arrest.

Hall was granted bail until his sentencing date on June 17.

Judge Russell told him that all sentencing options remain open including immediate custody.

Hall's barrister, Crispin Aylett QC, said: 'The defendant is, of course, sorry for what he has done. Through me he wishes to apologise to his victims.

'He is not a man easily moved to self pity but he is only too aware his disgrace is complete.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
