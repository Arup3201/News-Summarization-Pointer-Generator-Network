A British millionaire accused of keeping a harem of lovers against their will at his Spanish mansion claims he was framed in an elaborate theft plot.

Oil tycoon Shoja Shojai, 56, was arrested after nine women claimed he used emotional abuse and threats of violence to keep them at his villa in Marbella.

The group, who are mostly aspiring models in their 20s, told police that he had fathered seven of their children and made them take it in turns to spend the night with him in an adjoining property.

Defiant: Shoja Shojai, an Iranian-born British oil millionaire, has hit out at claims he held nine women against their will

Innocence: The women at his house were fashion students who were free to come and go, he insists

Luxury: Mr Shojai rents the holiday mansion in Marbella for a cost of £6,500 per month

But in an extraordinary twist, Mr 
Shojai yesterday claimed that the women made up the ‘ludicrous’ 
allegations as part of a plot to steal from him.

He alleged that while he was in 
custody for two days they hired two 45ft trucks to take 75 Persian rugs,
 20 tapestries and jewels worth £2million from his ten-bedroom house.

Mr Shojai admitted having a sexual 
relationship with three of the women, including his wife, a 33-year-old 
Dane who he is divorcing. The Iranian-born businessman, who has a 
British passport and has spent most of his life in the UK,  also claimed
 to have only four  children, two with his wife.

He added: ‘The idea I had a harem is madness.

‘It’s impossible to keep one woman, let alone nine. I have slept with three of my female accusers including my wife.

Opulent: The lavishly decorated drawing room of Mr Shojai's house where he is accused of holding his lovers prisoner

Home: The swimming pool attached to the Marbella mansion, where Mr Shojai is now holed up with a gardener and housekeeper

‘The other women were simply friends 
of theirs who worked with them in the fashion business and had their own
 homes and came and went from my house when they wanted. The claim I was
 holding them here against their will is ludicrous.’

Mr Shojai claims his accusers 
carefully planned the theft by hiring a warehouse in Germany a month 
ahead of time to store stolen goods, and that they booked the removal 
trucks two weeks ago.

He claims that one of the women acted 
as the ringleader, accusing her of reporting him to police for physical 
assault in an attempt to solve her ‘major financial problems’.

‘She told the others I had been 
arrested by the FBI and taken to Guantanamo Bay and they needed to pack 
up and leave before the police arrived,’ he said. ‘They fell for it. My 
house was robbed while I was in the police station answering domestic 
violence allegations made against me.

Plot: Mr Shojai says he is the victim of a conspiracy to loot thousands of valuable objects from his home

Bedroom: One of the eight bedrooms installed at the Marbella mansion where nine women were allegedly imprisoned

Sun-kissed: But the mansion was hellish for the women forced to live there, according to some of them

Home: One of the alleged mistresses used to live in this terrace in the London district of Maida Vale

‘Thankfully I was released from custody in time and we managed to stop the trucks before they left Spain.’

He added: ‘I completely and absolutely deny all the allegations made against me. This was a cover-up to rob me.’

Mr Shojai, who says he set up a 
Swiss-based oil brokerage firm, Universal Resources Industries, after 
being privately educated in England, has hired three lawyers.

The women say he met most of them at a
 London fashion school and told them he was an oil tycoon with powerful 
friends who could help their careers. They say he reneged on his 
promises and used  verbal abuse and threats of violence to keep them in 
his luxurious mansion.

The women, who knew him as Sasha, come
 from a variety  of countries, including Russia, Germany, Mongolia and  
Kazakhstan. The businessman claimed one of his accusers is said to have a house in 
Chelsea.

Investigation: Mr Shojai, pictured on the steps outside his holiday mansion, is currently the subject of a judicial probe

Anger: Mr Shojai says that while he was being questioned, removal vans took his possessions away

Clearing the air: Speaking from his lavishly appointed drawing room, Mr Shojai repeated claims of his innocence

He added: ‘I had a sexual relationship
 four years ago with [one of the women] for one month and with another 
approximately two years ago. I was separated from my wife at the time 
and did not consider myself to be married and I did not keep a harem 
here.

‘They had the best of everything. I 
can’t understand why they didn’t just take the jewellery and go instead 
of making up these abuse allegations.’

One of his accusers, who asked not be named, strongly denied his claims and said the women’s story is true.

She commented: ‘We haven’t given one 
millimetre of wrong information from our side and it can all be proved 
so I’m not worried. He’s trying to ruin  our lives even more by speaking
 publicly.’
