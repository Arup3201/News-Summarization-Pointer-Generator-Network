Spoon thieves are getting a chance to redeem themselves and get a free plate of food at the same time. 

Mexican restaurant Wahaca is offering an amnesty to light-fingered diners who keep stealing their spoons by giving away tacos for the safe return of their colourful cutlery.

The street food chain is giving people until the end of January to recoup some of the 4,000 spoons stolen each year.

The restaurant chain, which has 16 outlets in London, has just opened an outlet in Cardiff

But those returning spoons on 1 February will not be eligible for free food. 

Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2005 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, has outlets in 16 London locations and one in in Cardiff.

The company is offering a free bowl of tacos to any customer willing to walk into one of their restaurants and hand back their sought after brightly coloured plastic spoons.

The amnesty was first launched in  2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons. 

Wahaca spokesperson Oli Ingham, 32, said to MailOnline: 'What we tend to find is that people are more nervous at the very beginning of the year. 

'A trickle come in the beginning and when they find that we really are forgiving them, more start coming towards the end of the month.'

Every year, Mexican restaurant Wahaca has 4,000 of its colourful spoons stolen from its restaurants

According to Mr Ingham, the first couple of years were slow. But he is expecting a better response this time round.

'We are expecting it to be a lot higher this year. People seems to be getting behind the idea each time we do it and we try to spread the word a little further around every time.'

The Mexican standoff has led to Wanted posters being put up online by the street food company.

The posters state: 'Sure, they're irresistibly bright and some say ergonomically perfect. True, there's no finer ladle for your last mouthful, but please, PLEASE can we have them back?

Cardiff assistant general manager Rebecca Jones said: 'Four thousand people a year steal our spoons because they are quite fun and different. 

The amnesty was first launched in 2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons

'We remain convinced that the good customers of Wahaca wouldn't pocket anything underhandedly, and reassure ourselves at every stockcount, that most of our spoons are simply being borrowed.

'Which is why we're giving you another chance to seek absolution, by joining the Mexican Spoon Amnesty this January.'

To receive a free plate of tacos customers  who visit the restaurant in January simply have to return any stolen spoons to their waiter before ordering. 

But those who try to return the cutlery in February will not be entertained. 

'It's a one month only  amnesty. Our love has its limits,' Mr Ingham said. 

'Those who are more honest and haven't stolen spoons can still get free food,' he continued. 

'They just have to sketch a cutlery crime fighting souperhero, snap and share their #SpoonCartoon online to enter.'
