Arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive Premier League win at Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday night as they look to chase down second-placed Manchester City.

With a nine-point gap to leaders Chelsea, the title looks to be beyond Arsene Wenger's men yet again despite their recent good form.

But would finishing as runners-up to Jose Mourinho's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name? Arsenal fan Lee Hurley of blog Daily Cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the Gunners.

Just four points from second place, Arsenal haven’t finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil-rich Manchester City comes after the Emirates-austerity period has ended.

But while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans, it can’t be the end of Arsenal’s ambitions and it won’t be seen as success in its own right.

This is a club that wins titles, 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when Chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they couldn’t win them any other way.

In a league that contains clubs who have been outspending Arsenal significantly, to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted Arsenal, again, at the start of this season, who knows how much closer to Chelsea they might have been.

But that’s how it’s been with Arsenal over the past 10 years – a severe case of the ‘might have beens’ – what might have been had they not lost so many top players to City and Barcelona and United, or if Laurent Koscielny and Wojciech Szczesny not been monumental idiots in the League Cup final, or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the Emirates or Eduardo’s leg not been snapped in 2008 when Arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same, albeit in a less dramatic fashion. Or, or, or....

If I’m honest, it's all got a little tedious for many fans, which is why the FA Cup success last season was celebrated so wildly – a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts.

I can’t speak for all Arsenal fans. Such is the divide between Gooners, nobody could do that (so don’t trust anyone who claims they do). For some fans nothing short of a trophy every year would represent success to them, regardless of how stupid that expectation is.

For others they recognise how hard it is to just get in the top four every year (don’t believe me, ask Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester United, even Chelsea who dropped out for a season) and how the footballing landscape has changed so dramatically over the past decade.

Ultimately, football is about what you can celebrate and while it’s great fun to get into the Champions League every year, at least until the group stages are over, it’s just not the same as watching your captain lift aloft that great big trophy.

After years of scrapping fourth, I’d be more than content should Arsenal grab second place.

I want more, though, and I think that is the one and only thing that unites Arsenal fans – they all want more.

How patient we all plan to be for it to arrive is another matter altogether.

The last time the Gunners finished as high as second was 10 years ago

Supporters should be happy if Arsene Wenger's men achieve that

However, the club must start challenging for the Premier League title
