Paris Saint-Germain will make a fresh move to take Petr Cech on loan as the former Chelsea No 1 weighs up his options now that he has been dropped by Jose Mourinho.

The Chelsea boss insists he wants to keep Cech at the club as it affords him the luxury of having two of the world's best goalkeepers.

But PSG will test that resolve. They want to bring in Cech - as well as Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon - and would prefer to do a loan deal as it would help them in meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions.

PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure.

PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.

Mourinho believes he can keep both Thibaut Courtois and Cech happy and plans to play his second-choice keeper in occasional Premier League and Champions League games to keep him motivated.
