Former Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic is looking forward to a new challenge in Serie A.

The Serbian defender was unveiled to the media on Friday after joining Inter Milan as a free agent this summer after eight seasons at Old Trafford.

'I should have arrived to Italy many years ago,' Vidic said to www.inter.it. 'Finally I have the opportunity to play here.

Dream come true: Vidic (centre) expressed his happiness at joining the Serie A outfit at a press conference

'I don't think this is a step backwards in my career, I believe this is a step forward for me.

'Italian football suits my game well and, as I said before, I have joined one of the big European clubs.

'English football is different to Italian but that doesn't mean that Italian is more simple.'

The
 32-year-old has signed a three-year contract with the Nerazzurri outfit
 and is ready to help Inter return to winning ways in Italy and in 
Europe.

'Inter
 is one of the top clubs in the world, with a great history and 
tradition," he said. 'There was a new project in place and I immediately
 liked it.

'When Inter made an approach, there were many other clubs interested in me but not AC Milan. I'm happy to be here.

'I know the (club) president (Erick Thohir) has a long term plan and he wants to keep Inter at a high level.'

Vidic
 joined United from Spartak Moscow in 2006 and enjoyed a trophy-laden 
eight-year spell at Old Trafford, including five Premier League titles, 
one Champions League trophy and a Club World Cup.

Reports
 in Italy claimed Vidic could be handed the captain's armband after 
Inter's long-term skipper Javier Zanetti retired from football last 
month.

However, Vidic has denied such rumours.

'First
 of all I have to earn a place on the pitch,' he said. 'I've always 
given my best regardless of whether I have the captain's armband.'

Vidic is aware he will have to adapt to the tactics of Inter coach Walter Mazzarri.

'Last
 year I was able to watch many Inter games and I've had the opportunity 
to get to know my new team," he said.

'I've never played in a three-man 
defence but the role of a defender remains the same whether you play 
with three or four in the line.'

Inter finished fifth in Serie A and will compete in next season's Europa League.

The Nerazzurri have not won the Scudetto since the 2009-10 campaign.

"Even
 if I had stayed at United I would not have played in the Champions 
League," Vidic said. "We will play in the Europa League.

'I don't regret joining Inter. A club like Inter always has important ambitions and we will just have to make this club proud.'

When
 asked if his former United team-mate Javier Hernandez would follow in 
his footsteps and join Inter this summer, Vidic said: 'I don't know 
anything. He has not asked me for information about Inter.'

Mexican
 striker Hernandez has been strongly linked with a move away from Old 
Trafford, with Inter among the clubs reportedly keen to acquire his 
services.

Going? Vidic said he is unsure if his former Mancheter United team-mate Javier Hernandez will join Inter
