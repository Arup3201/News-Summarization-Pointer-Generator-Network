Chatham Town were at the centre of a jihadi attack, after a bungling hacker targeted their club website - mistaking it for a Premier League club.   

The Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, targeted Chatham Town website on Saturday ahead of its clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63.

The website was shut down for 12 hours after an image of a machine-gun wielding man wearing a gas mask was posted with a message asking: 'Where is the security?' 

A Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, posted a message on Chatham Town FC's website saying: 'I'm not Charlie. I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be'

Supporters of the tiny Kent club in Ryman League Division One  were left baffled by the message which also said: 'I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be.

'A little respect for other religions. Allah is One.'

The hacker also declared 'I am not Charlie' in reference to the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris which claimed the lives of 11 people. 

Bosses at the club apologised to fans, saying its website had been hacked.

Steve Archer, who looks after the website for the club, said the cyber attack 'made no sense' and that the hacker was probably thinking he was 'targeting a Premier League club'.

'It makes no sense - we're a part time football club so I'm pretty sure it's just a random attack - I hope it was,' he told Kent Online.

'Someone told me about 11pm. It must have been quite late as I had been working on it that evening.

The website of the small club which is in Division One North of the Isthmian League was shut down for 12 hours ahead of a clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63

'I'm just hoping I've not lost too much information. It's taken me two years to put it together, and I've spent a lot of time on the history section. I've got results on there going back to 1990.'

The average attendance at club's home matches at The Sports Ground, a 5,000 capacity stadium in Chatham, Kent, is just 143.

Chatham FC supporter John Hendry, 38, said: 'There is no way this guy would want to waste his time attacking a website that only a handful of people look at.

'He must have thought he was targeting a Premier League team or at least a Championship team - poor old Chatham must be low on the radar when it comes to cyber terrorism.'

Another local, calling himself Kentishman, said: 'Today Chatham Town FC. Tomorrow the world. Mwahhahahaha.

'I bet MI5 are putting their best people on it right now. These people know how to strike at the very heart of society.

The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk

'I'm inconsolable now I can't get access to the Chatham Town FC website. There's no point in carrying on.'

Another, calling himself Billbo, wrote: 'Hahahahaha. Literally the worst hack I've ever seen.'

The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk. 

He is believed to be part of X-AMZ Team along with fellow hackers ViRusx.EL, Nasser Eddine, Moroccan Wolf and AlFeRox.

In a previous message he has said: 'If you are asking why your website got hacked by me, it's basically because i want to share my message .

So, The Sahara is a Moroccan, Free Palestine. Viva Quassam And Hamass & F*** Israhell.' 

Thousands of French websites were hit by cyber attacks in the wake of the Paris shootings, but hackers have also set their sights on websites in other western countries. 

The Chatham Town website is now back up and running.
