A Russian cosmonaut has taken a stand against sexism by hitting back at a reporter who asked her questions about her hair and make-up ahead of her mission into space.

Yelena Serova was swift to chastise the offending member of the press after they made the comment at a NASA conference to mark the imminent launch of the joint US-Russian mission to the International Space Station (ISS).

In the video clip of the press conference which is quickly gaining traction online, a visibly frustrated and embarrassed Yelena challenges the journalist, asking why they have not asked her fellow male astronauts similar questions.

Yelena was obviously unimpressed by the nature of questions directed at her during the press conference

The type of questions asked of Yelena were very different to those asked of her male co-astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) and Alexander Samokutyaev (centre) 

The 38-year-old, who studied at Moscow Aviation Institute, will serve as a flight engineer aboard the International Space station as well as biophysics and medical experiments about the effect of being in orbit.

She is only the fourth Russian woman ever to be launched into space, and the first ever on the ISS.  

Given the serious nature of her mission, and the extensive training Serova has undergone, it is not surprising that she became frustrated when asked inane and totally unrelated questions simply based on her gender.

‘You are the first woman cosmonaut in 17 years, so what are you expecting from that flight? Are you going to take make-up with you?

Clearly irritated by the question, Yelena first simply chooses to ignore it, instead correcting the journalist on their facts.

‘Answering the second part of your question about women cosmonauts I would like to make a correction. I will be the first Russian woman cosmonaut on the ISS.’

However when asked another question, Yelena answers back directly.

The highly qualified cosmonaut was visibly annoyed to be asked questions about her hair and make-up

A second journalist asks: ‘Can you tell us about your day-to-day life on the station? For example how are you planning to do your hair?’

‘And I have a question for you! Why don’t you ask about Alexander’s (a male cosmonaut) hair? This is my answer I’m sorry.’

Yelena was launched into space today in the Soyuz spacecraft at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, accompanied by NASA’s Barry Wilmore and Russian Alexander Samokutyaev.

The group docked safely on the International Space Station earlier today 

She is expected to remain on the ISS for six months and many of the questions asked of Yelena focused on the fact that she will be separated from her 11-year-old daughter during the trip.

Although Yelena answers the questions calmly and in detail, the nature of the questions asked of her have riled heckles in feminist circles, especially since both her fellow astronauts also have children.
