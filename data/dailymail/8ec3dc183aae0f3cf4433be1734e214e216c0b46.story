A German professor has been forced to apologise for declining an Indian student's internship because of the 'rape problem' in his country.

Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger's response to the application went viral after it was posted online and prompted a wave of indignation, forcing the intervention of Germany's ambassador to India.

Her original response to the student's application stated: 'Dear Sir, unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships.

In response German ambassador to India Michael Steiner wrote a letter (pictured) stating he 'strongly objected' to her comments

'We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in my group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.'

This was later posted online, with the professor's and student's names redacted under the title: 'What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?'

Following the outrage which erupted, she backtracked on her comments, stating in an apology posted to Germany's embassy website that she had 'made a mistake' and apologized to 'everyone whose feelings I have hurt'.

When her email came to light, ambassador Michael Steiner wrote a scathing letter rebuking her for the comments, stating: 'Let me make it clear at the outset that I strongly object to this.'

He added, in reference to a notorious 2012 Dehli gang rape in which a woman died: 'The Nirbhaya case has triggered a lively, honest, sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that wouldn't be possible in many other countries.

Germany's India ambassador Michael Steiner (pictured) condemned the professor's comments in an open letter

'Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offence to these women and men (activists) ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians.

'Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists.'

In the 2012 case he referenced, the student was savagely attacked by six men including with an iron rod after boarding a private bus on her way home from the cinema with a male friend.

The woman, who legally cannot be named, died from her injuries 13 days later.

The brutality of the assault and her determination to survive so she could report her attackers to police sparked large-scale street protests.

Four of her attackers were convicted and given the death penalty in September after the case was fast-tracked, while a juvenile was sentenced to a correctional facility.

Another died in jail after apparently committing suicide.

The case sparked soul-searching about India's treatment of women and also led to initiatives to educate men about respect and equal gender rights in the deeply patriarchal country.
