Start racing along at more than three times the speed limit and you might expect the police to come after you.

What you might not expect is to get anywhere near to three times the speed limit when pedalling through the park on two wheels.

But that’s exactly what happened to Radio 2 star Jeremy Vine, who was confronted by police armed with speed guns as he cycled in Hyde Park yesterday.

A video of the incident posted online shows a police officer approaching Mr Vine and showing him a speed gun which indicates he was travelling too fast

He was caught zipping along at 16mph – when regulations limit cyclists to just 5mph in London’s Royal Parks.

A camera on the BBC presenter’s helmet captured the moment that officers stopped him and showed him the reading on their speed gun.

Vine, 49, was apologetic – but suggested that such a low speed limit puts cyclists in danger by forcing them on to roads, where they can ride faster but are far more at risk of an accident. He also complained the rule is not clearly signposted.

The star, who also presents Eggheads and Points of View, shared his video of the incident with his 260,000 followers on Twitter. 

His Radio 2 colleague Chris Evans quickly branded him ‘Speeding Vine’ and other social media users poked fun at police, questioning whether resources were being wasted and pointing out that 5mph is not all that much faster than the average walking speed. 

One Twitter user jokingly asked: ‘Are the police radar-gunning joggers as well?’

But there was also an angry backlash from pedestrians who accused Vine of behaving in a ‘dangerous’ way, and cited examples of cyclists whizzing past at great speed and almost knocking them over.

One user wrote: ‘Why should people have to dodge cycles going at three times walking pace so cycles don’t have to dodge traffic at two times cycle pace. Hypocritical?’

On his lunchtime radio show just hours after the incident, father-of-two Vine joked he was ‘off to practice cycling at 5mph’ and added: ‘I haven’t seen a radar gun for a long time so didn’t expect one with the digit 16 on it.

‘I feel embarrassed and I apologise. I didn’t see any signs. I certainly will be cycling as slow as walking pace in future.’

Earlier this year, Vine said that each morning his wife ‘says farewell in the manner of Japanese women who waved off pilot husbands in World War II’ due to the danger associated with cycling in London.

Rose Downes of the London Cycling Campaign backed Vine, saying: ‘Clearly it’s important for cyclists to behave considerately around pedestrians in parks, just as it is for motorists to behave considerately around cyclists on the roads – but a 5mph speed limit is almost walking pace.

‘We’d urge the Royal Parks to review the speed limit and raise it to something more in line with the average cyclist’s speed.’

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the officers were in the park as part of an ‘awareness operation’, during which ‘hundreds’ of cyclists were issued with advice and leaflets explaining the law.

A spokesman for Royal Parks added: ‘This wasn’t enforcement action and no penalty notices were issued – it was a gentle reminder of the need to be considerate to others.’

The latest incident comes after Mr Vine was criticised online for posting a helmet camera video of a mother crossing the road with a pram.

In one of the many cycling films he has posted on Twitter, he put up a video of a mother with two children crossing the road in front of him, along with the angry message: 'Watch the pram'.

But his followers hit back, suggesting the woman had the right of way as she had already started to cross when he turned onto the road.

Linking to the Highway Code, one website user wrote: 'Heads up: she had right of way, rule 170.'

It was the latest tweet by the star in which he expressed anger at conditions for cyclists in the capital.

Earlier this month, he responded to criticism for plans for cycle 'superhighways', by tweeting: 'Oh sorry. Apparently allowing cyclists to move around the capital without dying will "slow drivers down".'

He also tweeted a video he made of a taxi driving in front of him and added: 'Next time a taxi driver complains about “cyclists on the pavement,” I’ll politely show him this.'

Mr Vine has also sent out messages calling for a change to 'Cyclists Stay Back' signs on the sides of lorries.
