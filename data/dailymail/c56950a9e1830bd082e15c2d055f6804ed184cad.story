Roberto Di Matteo takes over the managerial reins at Bundesliga club Schalke 04 this week. He is not in for an easy ride.

The Italian, who has spent two years in the wilderness since being fired by Chelsea in 2012, has received a three-year contract at Schalke, with the club’s chief executive calling him 'a coach with international experience, who will bring us forward'.

Di Matteo, though, has experienced the brutal nature of managership before at West Brom and Chelsea, and he should not expect to be cut any more slack at Schalke.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 44 

Clubs manged: MK Dons (2008-09), West Brom (2009-2011), Chelsea (2012), Schalke (2014-)

Major honours: 1 Champions League, 1 FA Cup (both 2012) 

Far from being the epitome of a steady German ship, the Gelsenkirchen club can be as trigger happy as Roman Abramovich, having had eight managerial changes in the last six years. If things don’t go well for Di Matteo, he could soon be the ninth casualty.

His predecessor, Jens Keller, was expected to leave at the end of this season anyway, so Di Matteo’s appointment is without doubt an emergency measure. 

Schalke, whose financial situation and wealth of coveted young stars mean that Champions League football is essential for them, are currently languishing in 11th place, with a chronic inability to beat lesser teams. Di Matteo needs to change that fast if he is to survive more than half a season in Germany.

He is highly respected in Germany, largely due to the way his Chelsea team beat Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final. He was also linked with the Eintracht Frankfurt job last summer.

But doubts remain as to whether Di Matteo will be able to change Schalke’s fortunes. A poll on the website of local paper WAZ revealed the majority of Schalke fans are entirely unsure as to whether the club have made the right decision in replacing Keller.

A major worry for the pessimists is the fact that Di Matteo shares many similarities with his predecessor.

Both Keller and Di Matteo are tactically astute, but both have had problems in the past dealing with big egos in the dressing room. Keeping the likes of Kevin Prince Boateng onside often unsettled Keller, and Di Matteo will have to prove he has learned the lessons from his time at Chelsea and can be a much more authoritative force than Keller has been. 

Should he navigate the first year unscathed, the Italian will have a chance to build something impressive at Schalke. The club has produced some impressive young players such as Julian Draxler, Max Meyer and Sead Kolasinac in recent years and there is a foundation to be built upon. Without Champions League football, however, those talents would almost certainly be heading for greener pastures.

That is why Schalke have let Keller go. That is why Schalke need Di Matteo to make an immediate impact. If he doesn’t, the German side will prove to be no more merciful than West Brom or Chelsea.
