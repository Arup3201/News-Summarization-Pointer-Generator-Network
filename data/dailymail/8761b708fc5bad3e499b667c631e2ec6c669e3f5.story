Jordan Henderson admits England let their supporters down at the World Cup as they prepare to play in front of their lowest ever crowd at the new Wembley Stadium.

Just 40,000 supporters are expected at the national stadium for the friendly against Norway on Wednesday.

Henderson said: ‘The supporters were amazing in Brazil, but we let them down in Brazil. We are putting the World Cup to bed with a lot of new faces in the squad with a lot of potential.

‘We are looking forward to the next few games and we will put the shirt on and do our best as we always do.

‘There is a lot of pressure when you play for England and when you play for Liverpool, but we want to prove the critics wrong.’ 

Just 10 outfield players, including captain Wayne Rooney, were deemed fit enough to take part in the first training session since that disappointing World Cup campaign.

Jack Colback, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Rose and Gary Cahill suffered injuries over the weekend and were  excluded from Monday's session at London Colney. 

Roy Hodgson is already without 12 senior players so he will be hoping for no more withdrawals.

Henderson, Fabian Delph, Calum Chambers, Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and Henderson all undertook light recovery sessions indoors because they played for their respective clubs on Sunday.
