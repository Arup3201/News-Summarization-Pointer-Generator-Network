Thousands of people who fled Syria's 'capital of the revolution' two years ago returned today to see the apocalyptic destruction wreaked on their city.

Snapping photographs on their phones, the displaced first began wandering nervously down paths carved from rubble yesterday in the old quarters of Homs, where thousands died in the ultimately failed battle by rebels against the troops of President Bashar al-Assad.

The scene that greeted them was devastating. Whole city blocks had been pounded into an endless scene of hollowed-out buildings, covered in dust. The streets were littered with shattered concrete bricks, toppled telephone poles and charred, crumpled skeletons of cars.

Apocalyptic: Many of the people who began streaming into the old quarters of Homs yesterday had not seen their homes for two years. They were greeted by a post-apocalyptic landscape of burnt-out buildings and charred cars, and had to traverse paths through the rubble which government forces had cleared hours earlier

Then and now: This image taken before the conflict shows how the same street in Homs used to look, until it was ravaged by three years of civil war

Devastation: Smoke rises from al-Hamdeya neighbourhood in Homs yesterday. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting between rebels and forces of President Assad

Returning home: Some were lucky to find possessions still intact after two years, but many were not. Whole tower blocks were reduced to dust and twisted metal

Steady stream: Former residents filmed the blacked-out buildings on their camera phones as they returned to claim their possessions and begin rebuilding the city

Return to normal: Some squares looked remarkably untouched and thousands of people continued today to flood back into abandoned neighbourhoods

More than 150,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad's regime began in March 2011, and Homs was the centre of much of the fighting, known by many as the 'capital of the revolution'.

Once a thriving city of more than a million people, President Bashar Assad's troops blockaded the neighborhoods of Homs for more than a year, pounding rebel bastions with his artillery and air force.

Finally, under a deal struck this week, the rebels surrendered in a major victory for the government.

The regime assumed control of the old quarters, while in return some 2,000 rebel fighters were granted safe passage to opposition areas north of Homs.

The final piece of the agreement fell into place yesterday afternoon as the last 300 or so rebels left Homs, and an aid convoy was allowed into two pro-government villages in northern Syria which had been besieged by the opposition.

The seizure of Homs is not only symbolic - the city is also a tactical and logistical linchpin which the government can use to launch further offensives on rebel-held territory in the north.

Lawless: The Syrian Civil War began as an uprising more than three years ago, as rebels took to the streets to protest against five decades of rule by the Ba'ath party

Tension: Although the peace deal was a major victory for the Syrian government, troops were still patrolling the streets and escorting residents in and out of the area

A path through the wreckage: Once a thriving city of more than a million people, Homs will now be a linchpin from which Assad's forces can launch further offensives

Bleak: Long since abandoned, shops lay in ruins with their metal shutters twisted out of shape from the fighting. Many buildings still stand, but others were flattened

Battered: The remains of buildings in  one of the worst-hit neighbourhoods. People returning were required to hand over their IDs to government troops

Even before the last rebels departed, government bulldozers were clearing paths through the heaviest rubble in Homs' battle-scarred districts yesterday.

It marked the first time that government troops have entered these neighborhoods, the last rebel bastions in the city, in more than a year.

Homs governor Talal Barazi said engineering units were combing Hamidiyeh and other parts of the old quarters in search of mines. State TV said two soldiers were killed while dismantling a bomb.

Troops reportedly discovered two field hospitals in the neighborhoods of Bab Houd and Qarabis, and network of underground tunnels linking the districts to each other and to the countryside.

In Hamadiyeh, a predominantly Christian neighborhood before the fighting caused residents to flee, people trickled back in to check on their properties.

Imad Nanaa, 52, returned to examine his home for the first time in almost three years - and found it almost intact, compared to other houses with shattered windows and crumbling walls.

Speaking nervously and hurriedly because he wanted to leave as quickly as possible, he said he was looking forward to coming back with his family as soon as the army allowed it.

'This deal has saved us from more blood and destruction,' he said.

Life resumes: Thousands of people are returning to burnt-out neighbourhoods to fetch their possessions before the army allows them to return permanently

Growing up: As people's confidence grew throughout yesterday and today, residents brought their children back to their homes, including some in pushchairs

Poignant: One man left the home he abandoned years earlier carrying a guitar, its case still caked in dust from the fighting. Another woman had a stack of photo albums

Truce: Forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad play football at al-Hamdeya neighborhood in Homs as the area's remaining 270 rebels were granted safe exit

Trinkets: People removed sentimental heirlooms from their homes. Homs Governor Talal Barazi announced that the old city has become 'safe and empty of weapons and gunmen thanks to the heroes of the Syrian Arab Army'. The rebels have been exhausted by two years of fighting and will now face a renewed assault in the north

Rubble-strewn: A man carries a religious figure yesterday through the primarily Christian neighbourhood, which has been one of the worst-hit in the two-year siege

Hundreds of men, women and children - some in pushchairs - walked through parts of the eight-mile-long old quarters, flashing victory signs and taking pictures. Some men in the first group dashed inside, passing burned-out cars and heavily damaged buildings.

People returning were required to hand over their IDs to the troops upon entering the formerly rebel-held districts. The soldiers then returned the papers as the people filed out later.

One man walked out with a guitar under his arm. A woman emerged from her home carrying a stack of photo albums.

'I have nothing left for me to remember so I brought these photos,' the woman, Fadia al-Ahmar, said. 'My house was destroyed.'

The staggering scale of destruction in the area spoke to the ferocity of the fighting.

In the Maljaa neighborhood, every building was damaged, even cars parked inside. An eight-storey building was flattened into rubble. Shop fronts were pancaked and walls of apartment blocks were blasted with holes from artillery and tank shells.

A bitter victory: Pro-government forces were cheerful, but the fighting has claimed 150,000 lives, and for some in the country anti-Assad sentiment is still strong

Troops: All the churches in one neighbourhood were damaged by the fighting, but it is not known whether they were deliberate targets of Islamist extremists among the rebels, or simply random casualties of the fighting like hundreds of other buildings. Greek Orthodox bishop George Abu Zakhm said the situation in Homs is 'catastrophic'

Contemplative: A resident talks on his phone as he looks up at the remains of a building. One woman said: 'I have nothing left for me to remember so I brought photos'

Celebration: A boy takes photos of a man and his children at Old Clock square in Homs (left) and former residents Ayman and Zinat return to their neighbourhood (right)

Untouched: This photo of the city's Old Clock square nearby, taken in December 2011 when the conflict was in its infancy, highlights the devastation wrought

Rubble: Damage to the Um al-Zinar church, one of 11 in the old quarter of Homs. The city's Greek Orthodox bishop said all 11 of the churches have been badly damaged

Protest remains: A staged photo by the anti-government activist group Aleppo Media Center (AMC) shows citizens forming the word Homs in Arabic with their bodies

Back in Hamadiyeh, the historic St Mary Church of the Holy Belt was heavily damaged, although the thick stone walls were still standing.

There were no pews and some of the icons were disfigured, while the Syriac Orthodox church's damaged bell lay on the ground in the courtyard.

The Greek Orthodox bishop in Homs, George Abu Zakhm, said the situation there is 'catastrophic'.

He added all 11 churches in Homs' old quarter have been either heavily damaged or destroyed.

He accused the rebels of lighting a fire inside the 6th century Greek Orthodox St. Elian Church, and said icons dating back hundreds of years 'are still on the walls but they were blackened.'

Islamic extremists among Syria's rebels have desecrated churches elsewhere in Syria, but there was no immediate evidence to suggest that opposition fighters were responsible for the damage to Christian sites in central Homs.

The truth is that almost every building, not just churches, bore heavy and tragic scars from the fighting.
