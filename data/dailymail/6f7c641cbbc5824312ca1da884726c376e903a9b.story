First time buyers are now forced to save for an average of eight years before they can build a deposit large enough to get on the property ladder, a new survey has revealed.

The latest figures show aspiring home owners now wait eight times longer to purchase their first home than those in the 1990s who only needed one year on average to save a deposit.

This has led to 60 per cent of Britons now asking their parents for financial help so they can get a mortgage, the research by Barclays found.

The saving trend: First time buyers in 1995 needed to save for just one year for a deposit. The figure peaked in 2009 at 10 years and now stands at eight years

And in London, first time buyers wait even longer to get on the property ladder, with most having to save for ten years before they have a deposit large enough to get a mortgage.

This compares to just 11 months for the average Londoner in 1995. 

After London, the buyers with the second longest wait to get on the property ladder are in the South West with an average nine years and 11 months of saving.

Residents in the West Midlands are third on the list, with the average first time buyer saving for nine years and 10 months.

Those in the North West and Wales have the lowest average saving period of four years and 11 months.

Analysts believe the lengthy wait is often the result of miscalculated budgeting as most first-time buyers underestimate how much they have to save, especially in London.

A long wait: The average first time buyer now has to save for eight years before they have a deposit large enough to get on the property ladder

The average deposit required to buy a home is now 20 per cent of the property price compared with five per cent in 1995, setting savers back eight years, whereas most first-time buyers wrongly think a 16 per cent deposit is required which would take them just over six years to save.

This means the average first-time buyer in London underestimates how much they need to save by £22,272, believing they need seven years to raise £47,728, when in fact they will need nearly 11 years to raise £70,000.

In contrast, the average househunter in the North West and the North East overestimates the amount they need to save by £2,000.

Although 60 per cent of Britons need help getting on the ladder, the report says only 30 per cent will get family support, of which two in five see this as a gift that they will not pay back.

The figures are more optimistic than during the 2009 crash when househunters faced a 10-year average wait, with the lowest wait in the North West at six years, five months and the highest in the West Midlands lasting up to 13 years and two months.
