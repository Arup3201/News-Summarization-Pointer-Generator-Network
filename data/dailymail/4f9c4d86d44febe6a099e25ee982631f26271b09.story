The stabbing of Ann Maguire in front of her pupils triggered a national debate over security in our schools last night.

Head teachers demanded stronger backing for schools which choose to introduce airport-style metal detectors and frisk pupils for weapons.

But they said schools must not be ‘locked down’ in the wake of the incident.

Staff have repeatedly voiced concern over the risk of violent attacks on school premises.

Vigilant: Metal detectors at a school in Leyton, east London

Latest figures show that 550 pupils a year are expelled from schools in England for assaulting a member of staff and 17,000 short-term suspensions are handed out.

Last week, police disclosed that nearly 1,000 children – 80 of them primary pupils – have been caught taking weapons into school in three years.

A survey of teachers found that more than half have been subjected to verbal abuse or threats from pupils.

Children are being instilled with a ‘blame someone else’ culture at home and also believe they can treat teachers ‘like servants’, the NASUWT report claimed.

Schools have been granted powers to frisk pupils for weapons and a range of contraband by patting down their clothing. They can also screen whole groups with security arches or wands.

But head teachers warned last night that many staff remain reluctant to conduct the searches. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘People are not necessarily comfortable with the powers. What I think is right is that this is taken on a school-by-school basis.

‘Where there are tensions in a particular school that school could take the choice, for example, to exclude a pupil or to install metal detectors. Schools need to be confident in exercising their powers and know they will be backed by the local authority.

‘A school has to set boundaries and be that place in the community where a pupil knows they will be safe.’

But he stressed: ‘We don’t want to lock down all schools where there are no problems or risks. Schools should be open to the community unless you have got particular reasons to suspect there might be issues.’

Hilary Benn, Labour MP for Leeds Central, described the incident as ‘profoundly saddening’. But he added: ‘Schools are places of learning. We want our schools to be open – we don’t want to lock pupils and staff behind high fences.’

In 2008, the Labour Government announced plans for airport-style metal detectors in hundreds of schools. The following year, the east London borough of Waltham Forest became the first to announce that detectors would be used at its 22 secondary schools.

Guidance from the Coalition says pupils can be made to pass through a metal detector even if there is no suspicion they have a weapon. If they refuse, they can be barred. Schools are also increasingly installing CCTV and drafting in police officers to patrol corridors and classrooms. Campaigners say such measures can unfairly ‘criminalise’ youngsters.

Professor Terry Haydn of  the University of East Anglia warned this month that pupils in England were among the worst-behaved in the developed world.

The Government and Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the scale of classroom indiscipline, he said.
