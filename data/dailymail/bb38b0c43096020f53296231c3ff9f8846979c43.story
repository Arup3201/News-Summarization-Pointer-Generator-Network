Madeleine McCann's parents said today their belief she could be alive has been 'reinforced' after police failed to find any clues during an eight-day search operation in Portugal.

Kate and Gerry McCann said they were 
'very pleased' forensic searches had taken place in 
Praia da Luz and it was 'gratifying' to know more will happen over the coming months.

It comes as the couple will return to Portugal on Monday to deliver statements to the libel 
trial of former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral, who the McCanns 
are suing over claims in his book The Truth Of The Lie.

New hope: Gerry and Kate McCann, pictured in the days after Madeleine disappeared, said today the lack of clues found by police in Praia da Luz 'reinforces' their belief she is still alive

Amaral claims in his book that the McCann's faked their daughter's abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment.

Spokesman
 Clarence Mitchell said: 'I can confirm that Kate and Gerry are planning
 to attend court in Lisbon on Monday when they will give their personal 
statements having successfully appealed to do so.'

Scotland
 Yard yesterday abandoned their search of land close to where Madeleine 
vanished in 2007, but said the multi-million-pound 
inquiry will soon move into a new phase after negotiations with the 
Portuguese authorities.

Mr and Mrs McCann said in a statement 
today: 'We are very pleased that significant activity has taken place in
 Praia da Luz over the last 10 days.

'We
 are further encouraged that despite the intensive searches, no trace of
 Madeleine has been found and this reinforces our belief that she could 
still be alive.

'As 
parents of a missing child, we have always wanted all reasonable lines 
of inquiry to be followed and it is gratifying to know that a 
substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months with 
the close co-operation of the British and Portuguese authorities.

'We would like to thank all those involved for their efforts and the members of the public who have come forward with information.'

Senior
 officers said the searches were the ‘first phase’ of the investigation 
into the disappearance of Madeleine, who was three when she went missing
 in Praia da Luz in May 2007, and more activity will ‘commence shortly’.

This
 could include the arrest of a handful of suspects who detectives 
suspect may be able to cast fresh light on the notorious case.

The
 announcement came just hours after graffiti was daubed in large orange 
letters on a brick wall opposite one of the search areas.

Written in Portuguese, the misspelled message translated as: ‘Maddie’s parents killed her. English police are stupid!’

The
 attack was the latest sign of anger among locals at the high-profile 
police inquiry, which is taking place as the annual tourist season takes
 off.

New phase: Police also inspected sewers under wasteland minutes from where Madeleine was last seen

Business owners have been joking that the police operation is a new tourist attraction, with many visitors asking for directions to the latest search site.

Over the past eight days, officers have undertaken the biggest search undertaken overseas by a team of British police.

They have searched to the ‘highest possible standards’ an area of scrubland equal in size to around nine football pitches.

This
 included checking water pipes, drainage channels and derelict buildings
 around the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz on the Algarve.

Police
 also searched a horseshoe-shaped piece of waste ground that was 
specifically identified as an area of interest by the latest inquiry.

A
 Met spokesman said 41 ‘ground anomalies’ – areas where the earth had 
been disturbed – were discovered by aerial surveys and 
ground-penetrating radar equipment. 

These sites, which 
included three outside the original area, were then painstakingly 
checked by search teams. The spokesman added: ‘At this time no evidence 
relating to Madeleine McCann has been identified.

‘However it has given us an essential understanding of the activity on – and people that have used – this piece of land.

‘This
 was the first phase of this major investigation, which has been agreed 
with the Portuguese following the four International Letters of Request 
submitted to date. More activity has been agreed and we expect that to 
commence shortly.

‘In addition, further requests are being compiled and will be submitted in due course.’

The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in 2011, codenamed Operation Grange.

Senior
 officers stress that the operation in Portugal mirrors what would take 
place in Britain for a murder or high-risk missing person inquiry. They 
say there is still a ‘substantial amount of work’ to be done in the 
coming weeks and months.

Police said the searches  covered ‘just the one hypothesis’ that Madeleine was killed and buried locally. There are many others.

The dawn-to-dusk searches have involved teams of officers armed with pickaxes, spades and specialist search dogs.

Accompanied by Portuguese officers, they examined three sites and removed several items for further analysis.

One
 shopkeeper was sceptical over whether the searches would bring police 
any close to finding Madeleine. ‘People keep coming in asking what’s 
going on and where,’ he said. ‘It seems to be the new tourist 
attraction.

‘It is a 
beautiful resort and shouldn’t be spoiled by searches for a girl who 
disappeared a long time ago and will probably never be found.’
