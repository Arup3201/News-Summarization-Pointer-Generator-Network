He is the kind-faced dog that stole the nation's heart after being abandoned in a railway station because of a painful eye condition.

But after undergoing an operation, Kai the Shar-Pei is in good health - and on the lookout for a new owner. 

The  animal was found tied up in Ayr train station on January 2 looking forlorn next to a suitcase of his belongings.

Kai the Shar-Pei was abandoned in Ayr rail station earlier this month. The animal has undergone eye surgery since being discovered by the SSPCA, and is now recovering in their care

He had been left there by Fin Rayner from Aberdeen, who says she was tricked into buying him after seeing an advert on Gumtree. 

Following a police appeal, thousands shared their sympathy for Kai's plight online and inundated the Scottish SPCA with offers to take him home.

Animal lovers also raised enough money to pay for the mongrel to undergo surgery to correct a condition which made his eyelashes curl inside his eyelids. 

Carers are considering a short list of applicants while Kai makes his recovery, but they are confident he will be re-homed soon. 

The operation was a success, with Kai now recovering in the care of SSPCA vets. 

'He’s had the operation on both eyes, which was very successful, and he is just going through the healing process just now.

'It’s looking really good for him. He needs to wear the collar just so he doesn’t scratch them.

'He is really coming on. He’s very friendly and he has really been an asset to the society,' said Sharon Bruce, senior animal care assistant. 

Carers were inundated with requests to re-home the dog after he was discovered with a suitcase of his belongings in the train station

Kai had been listed as for sale on Gumtree, and left with an owner who did not want to look after him

The animal was discovered in Ayr rail station earlier this month after being tied up by Ms Rayner, a mother-of-three. 

The 39-year-old had travelled from Aberdeen after seeing an advert of a dog on Gumtree, but claims Kai was not the animal listed for sale. 

After telling his seller she wanted to take him for a walk to test his temperament, Ms Rayner claims to have suddenly found herself responsible for him when the seller drove away.

Unsure what to do, she decided to leave him at the rail station where she was boarding a train back to Aberdeen. 

The mother-of-three previously said she did nothing wrong. 

An investigation has been launched into how the animal came to be bought and sold online and he will star in a PETA campaign warning against such transactions.
