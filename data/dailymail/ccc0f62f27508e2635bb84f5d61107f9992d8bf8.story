As my grandson raced up the drive towards us and hurled himself into Michael’s waiting arms, I looked at my husband’s face and had to catch my breath.

As he threw Jasper into the air, the look of utter love and adoration was magical.

Why? Well, my husband is notoriously formidable and high-achieving. Michael is a former leader of the Conservative Party — and is remembered for his uncompromising stance on crime and prison reform.

Yet these days, he receives the most profound joy from the simple pleasure of lifting a squealing three-year-old into the air (complete with jet engine noises).

Michael has locked horns with the BBC’s chief rottweiler Jeremy Paxman and earned the respect of Margaret Thatcher — no mean feat.

But today, give him a jigsaw, a stretch of lawn and a football, or a great cupboard for a game of hide-and-seek, and he shines with a brilliance quite removed from anything seen in his professional life.

Little children bring great men down to size. But they also bring out the softest, gentlest — dare I say, the best — side in even the most powerful, formidable males.

That’s why, when I saw the photos of Sir Alex Ferguson surrounded by his brood of grandchildren, on the week he announced his retirement from Manchester United, I had to smile. There is something completely entrancing about seeing a powerful man — an Alpha Male, if you will — transformed into a cuddly grandad.

But a life as a cuddly grandad is what Michael — and Sir Alex — have worked their whole lives for. This is the down-time they deserve. The football plaudits, the political accolades, the entry in Who’s Who — none of them compare with the satisfaction of being surrounded by people who love you simply for being ‘grandpa’.

We have four grandchildren — two from my son (Michael’s stepson) Sholto: Louis, 14, and Tallula, 12, and two from our daughter Larissa: Jasper, three, and Theo, five months. He’s been a terrific grandpa to them all.

And — while I adore them all to bits — when it comes to being a doting and devoted  grandparent, my husband has me beaten hands down.

Try as I might, I’m far too impatient to get involved in all the games they want to play or answer the endless stream of questions that come from nowhere and go round in circles. 

Maybe Michael’s better prepared than me: he did study Law at Cambridge, after all, and has sat through endless rounds of debate in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Who would have thought they would provide such good training for grandparenting?

As anyone who knows him well will tell you, Michael is one of the most impatient men on Earth.

If there’s a book he wants to read, he can’t wait to get his hands on it straight away, often before he’s even sat down. And if he has an appointment to get to, there’s no way he will be late. It’s the one characteristic he deplores in me — I’m the worst timekeeper in the world.

But when it comes to his grandchildren, his patience is infinite. While I itch for a distraction, Michael will sit on the floor and fit the same piece of jigsaw into the puzzle over and over again.

He has spent endless hours patiently teaching Jasper to throw and catch a ball. When we’re out for a pizza and Jasper’s getting fractious, he knows exactly how to distract him — with a game of pyramids where he’ll put one hand on top of Jasper’s and so on, seeing who can pull their hand out first.

If only Jeremy Paxman had been so easy to deal with.

We get the most bemused looks from other diners — fascinated that this man they recognise from weighty debates on Newsnight should be such an old softie.

Being a grandpa brings out the little boy that lurks in most men. Take the first time Jasper came for a sleepover at our house. He was just two and was beside himself with excitement when Michael promised him a trip on the little steam train that chugs through the Romney Marshes near our home.

He was so excited the waiting was torture — for me at least. ‘When are we going on the train?’ Jasper asked at five-minute intervals. ‘Soon,’ I replied with increasing levels of frustration.

Michael, however, didn’t turn a hair and cheerfully fielded the same question over and over again. A politician is used to such relentless grilling.

I don’t know which of them was more excited as the train finally set off. ‘All aboard,’ Jasper yelled.

It took me a few seconds to work out where Jasper had picked up that particular phrase. Then the penny dropped.

He’d heard it in the Thomas The Tank Engine stories, which Michael loves to read to him. Another grandfatherly job he fulfils with great aplomb — down to doing all the voices.

When Jasper wasn’t yelling ‘all aboard’, he was excitedly pointing out all the sheep in the fields. And, believe me, there were hundreds.

‘Sheep. Sheep,’ he squealed. I was exhausted just listening to it all. But not Michael.

Michael revels in being teased. Like most grandparents we have made a habit of telling Jasper that he is a good boy. ‘Very good Jasper,’ we’ll tell him when a job has been well done. Now he loves turning the tables. ‘Very good, Grandpa,’ he will announce when he manages to beat Michael at football. And, yes, my highly competitive husband does allow his three-year-old grandson to beat him sometimes.

But that doesn’t mean he’s a total pushover. Jasper adores playing hide-and-seek. Sadly, he’s yet to grasp the concept of hiding. When he stands in the middle of our garden, ‘hiding’ in full view, Michael explains, patiently: ‘No Jasper, that really isn’t hiding you know.’

As a former barrister, even his worst enemy couldn’t accuse Michael of being an intellectual slouch. Yet, despite his powerful intellect, he finds it very easy to get into the mindset of a very small child.

When Jasper’s baby brother Theo was born at Christmas, Michael was acutely aware that Jasper might feel jealous. His solution? To give Jasper an extra-special role as a big brother.

One of the loveliest things is watching the pair of them plotting how they are going to get the baby up to scratch.

A few evenings ago I caught them deep in conversation. ‘Do you think you’ll be able to help me to teach Theo how to throw a ball?’ Michael was asking solemnly. Nodding his head, Jasper looked so proud. But the truth is that Michael has always been a family man. It’s one of the things I love most about him.

He took his share of nappy-changing when our two children were babies and I have an image of him winding them over his shoulder while reading government papers, before going off to Parliament with baby sick on the shoulder of his suit.

But now he’s semi-retired, like Sir Alex Ferguson, he at last has time to devote to his family. I know his unbounded adoration of his grandchildren causes some raised eyebrows.

For example, as a member of the House of Lords, he was offered two tickets to watch the flotilla for the Queen’s Jubilee last summer: one for a guest, one for a child under five. He was desperate to bring Jasper and was frustrated on being told that, as his grandchild rather than his child, Jasper couldn’t attend.

‘But surely the invitation should apply to grandchildren,’ he argued. ‘After all, how many members of the House of Lords have children under five?’ He won his point and both Larissa and Jasper accompanied him.

Jasper spent the entire time on Michael’s shoulders yelling: ‘Come on boats.’ If Michael was proud to be part of the procession that wet and so very British day, he was even prouder to share it with his grandson.

I’ve no doubt Lady Ferguson will have plenty of plans for Sir Alex on his retirement. And, as they will discover, the joys of retirement are many. Their hours will be theirs again, and theirs to enjoy, as grandparents. I can’t think of a nicer way to reward a job well done.
