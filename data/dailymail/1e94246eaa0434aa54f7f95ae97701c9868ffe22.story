A magazine supporting the homeless population in Sweden is embarking on a pioneering initiative to allow customers to pay by card.

The Scandinavian country's answer to the Big Issue, Situation Sthlm, has launched the new scheme with payment company iZettle.

In a month-long trial five magazine sellers were sent on to the streets of Stockholm with a smartphone and special card reader, provided by iZettle, to sell issues of the £5 publication.

The card reader is plugged into the phone allowing cards to be swiped and payments taken in the street.

The customer is then asked to write their signature on the screen or enter their pin number in the reader.

iZettle chief executive Jacob de Geer told the Guardian people living in Sweden, which is fast becoming a 'cashless society', are happy to trust their card details to homeless people due to their faith in the credit card chip system.

He said: 'The banks have done a great job with the
 card infrastructure so that it is so robust, secure and trusted, that 
people don’t really mind where they use their cards these days with the 
chip.

'It was extremely well received. All the phones 
were returned safely and are still in use.'

The phones and card readers are kept securely at Situation Sthlm's main offices, and are picked up each day when the sellers arrive to collect their magazines.

The magazine, which is similar to the UK's Big Issue, features professional writing by people who are homeless or disadvantaged. It is the first publication of its kind to offer card payments.

Chip and PIN technology was introduced in the UK in 2004 following a trial in Northampton in 2003.

It replaced the magnetic swipe and signature authorisation previously used, requiring card holders to use their PIN number to allow payments to be processed.

iZettle launched in the UK last year, and is a market leader for mobile payments with a Bluetooth chip and PIN card machine.

The firm launched in the UK last year after meeting the 'tough' regulatory requirements.

'Simplify, simplify, simplify is our core ethos,' Mr de Geer added. 'Regulation is the biggest challenge to mobile payments in most countries – we spend a lot of time and effort meeting criteria and gaining certification. We’re regulated almost like banks.'
