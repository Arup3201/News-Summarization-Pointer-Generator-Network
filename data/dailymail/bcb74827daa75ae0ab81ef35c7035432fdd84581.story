Victim: A murder investigation has been launched after a mother, believed to be Krishnamaya Mabo (above), was strangled and dumped in a field in Arborfield, near Reading, on Sunday

A soldier's wife was ambushed, dragged into a field and murdered by a stranger as she walked down a country lane just 500 yards from her home, it emerged today.

The 39-year-old's body was found lying next to a copse at the edge of a field after apparently being choked to death.

It is thought she could have been dead for up to 18 hours before she was discovered.

The victim, believed to be Nepalese national Krishnamaya Mabo, lived in Army married quarters on a garrison estate in Arborfield a quarter of a mile away.

A letter issued by Garrison Commander 
Colonel Ian Gibson warned residents not to 'venture out alone, 
especially at night' in the wake of the killing.

Sources believe Krishnamaya was attacked by a stranger as she made the most of the sunny weather at around 6pm on Sunday evening.

Her killer is thought to have followed her up a country lane and pounced when they were out of sight of passing traffic and walkers.

Today, detectives were continuing to question a 30-year-old man on suspicion of her murder after he was arrested in Reading, around three miles from the scene of the attack.

Magistrates this afternoon granted investigators a further 36 hours to keep him in custody.

Police were called in to help search for Krishnamaya after she was reporting missing from her family's terraced home in Arborfield Garrison in the early hours of Monday morning.

A police helicopter and uniformed officers initially failed to find any trace of her.

But during a renewed search on Monday afternoon, a police officer stumbled across the body in a field as he walked up the country lane.

A spokesman for the MOD said Krishnamaya's husband was serving with the Military Provost Guard Service (MpGS).

He said: 'It is with deep sadness that the community of Arborfield Garrison learned of the tragic loss of Krishnamaya Mabo, the wife of a Ministry of Defence employee serving within the garrison.'Naturally our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends at this difficult time.'

News of the murder has rocked the military estate where up to 30 Nepalese families live.

Jaya Gurung, 34, said: 'My wife knew 
her well and she is very upset and frightened. I often walk in that 
field and I feel safe there. Next time I might have to think about it.'

The Mabos's neighbour Kathryn Scott, 28, added: 'It's shocking. I won't go out on my own at night.
'The neighbours are friendly and will always say "hello".'

A post-mortem examination carried out
by a Home Office pathologist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, 
yesterday concluded that the cause of death was asphyxiation.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police 
said: 'A woman's body was found in a field off Robin Hood Copse, between
Castle Hill and Eversley Road, at about 1pm (on Monday).

'Although
the formal identification procedure has not yet been carried out, the 
body is believed to be that of 39-year-old Krishnamaya Mabo.

'Krishnamaya, who is a Nepalese 
national, was reported as missing to Thames Valley Police in the early 
hours of Monday and an extensive search of the Arborfield area was 
carried out, involving police dog units and the police helicopter.'

Detective Chief Inspector Gill Wootton said officers were providing support to Krishnamaya's family during the investigation.

She
added: 'We are now working to establish Krishnamaya's movements on the 
evening of Sunday, June 2 and I would like to appeal to anyone who was 
walking in fields or woodland between Castle Hill and Eversley Road on 
Sunday afternoon or evening, to come forward if they have not already 
spoken to us.'
