Call of duty: San Marino, California, Mayor Dennis Kneier has admitted to throwing a bag filled with canine excrement onto a walkway belonging to a local resident

In political disputes mud-slinging is not uncommon, but the mayor of a small California town may have crossed the line by flinging feces into a rival’s yard.  

San Marino Mayor Dennis Kneier was caught on a surveillance camera Saturday hurling a small plastic bag filled with dog excrement onto a resident's walkway.

Kneier has since admitted to his foul transgression and apologized, saying he should have disposed of the animal waste properly.

Speaking to the Whittier Daily News, the mayor said he was walking home from a local park with his wife at around 6pm Saturday when they stumbled upon a bag of feces on Charlton Road.

Instead of throwing it in a garbage bin, the head of the municipality picked it up and flicked it onto a pathway belonging to Philip Lao.

The homeowner told NBC Los Angeles he recognized the mayor on surveillance video and called police, who responded to the home and photographed the sack of pungent evidence.

Mea culpa: After police became involved in the case, the mayor issued the homeowner an apology

Lao and Kneier have been at odds over a proposed dog park in San Marino - a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles with median household income of nearly $200,000, which more than 13,000 people call home.

The provenance of the bag of waste at the center of the controversy remains unknown as neither Kneier nor Lao own a dog. 

Mr Kneier said he delivered an apology letter cited by Pasadena Star-News to Lao, which read: ‘Dear Phil, Late in the day this past Saturday, June 7, Liz and I were returning from a walk in Lacy Park when we noticed a bag of dog waste in your west parkway near the lamp post. Rather than leave it or dispose of it properly, I placed it on your side walkway. This was a mistake, for which I apologize. It won’t happen again. Sincerely, Dennis Kneier.’

Lao turned the surveillance footage to police but declined to file charges against the mayor.

Sign of trouble: Lao and Kneier have been locked in a dispute over a proposed dog park backed by the mayor, who was also upset over 'no poop zone' signs posted on his opponent's front lawn

Philip Lao suspected that Kneier flung the bag as payback for opposing his plan to create a dog park in Lacy Park near his home, saying that pets tend to get into scraps when left unattended for hours by their owners.

Lao also has run afoul of the mayor by posting signs on his front lawn that read 'no poop zone.'
