UKIP leader Nigel Farage’s son has been given a conditional caution for being drunk and disorderly.

City trader Thomas Farage, 21, was arrested at 3am in the Square Mile in April.

He appeared at City of London Magistrate's Court today to hear he will be given a police caution for his behaviour.

Father and son: Thomas Farage appeared at City of London Magistrates Court today for being drunk and disorderly. His father, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, has refused to comment on the case

Details of the late night incident first emerged days before the local elections in which UKIP made big gains.

CPS guidelines state that low-level crimes by first-time offenders can be dealt with out of court using cautions, fines or community service if it is deemed appropriate.

Nigel Farage refused to discuss the case, telling reporters: ‘‘I have nothing to say, I have nothing to say, you’re ****ing in the wind with me.’

Mr Farage will receive a conditional caution after the incident near St Paul's Cathedral

The UKIP leader has two adult sons 
from his first marriage and two young daughters with second wife Kirsten
Mehr, a German broker.

Thomas Farage was arrested in the early hours of April 12 in St Martin's Le Grand, a street near St Paul's Cathedral.

Today he appeared in the dock at City of London Magistrates' Court wearing a smart grey suite, red tie and blue shirt.

He looked relaxed and spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.

Mrs Angela Williams, prosecuting, said: ‘Things have been carefully considered, I understand it has been agreed that Mr Farage can receive a conditional caution.

‘The appointment has been made for next Tuesday, 28 of May. I'm asking the court to adjourn this matter for two weeks.

‘If the conditional caution is satisfactorily completed then the case will be discontinued.’

It was the third time the case had been before the court after hearings in April and early May were adjourned at the request of the defence in April and early May.

Farage did not appear at his first hearing last month and his lawyers had asked prosecutors to deal with the case away from court.

Addressing Farage in the dock, Annie Allum, chair of the bench, said: ‘In the interests of justice we are going to adjourn this case until Friday May 31, if the caution process is not successful on the 28 May then you will be required to come back to court on May 31.

‘You will be on unconditional bail, you must be back in court at 9.30am on May 31 unless you are informed otherwise.

‘If you commit any offences whilst on bail they will be treated more seriously.’

Thomas Farage, who lives with his mother in Rochester, Kent was granted unconditional bail.
