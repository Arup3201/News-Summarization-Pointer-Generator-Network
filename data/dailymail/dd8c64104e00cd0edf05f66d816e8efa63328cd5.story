As the memorial to the victims of the Sydney siege continues to grow, a Muslim bride has made a pilgrimage on her wedding day to lay flowers at Martin Place.

Adorned in a white wedding dress, which included a traditional white hijab and veil, newlywed Manal Kassem arrived at the memorial with her husband, Mahmod Homaisi, to place her wedding bouquet among the tens of thousands of other floral tributes in the square.

The 23-year-old bride had planned for her wedding photos to be taken in the city, but had been hesitant to continue after the tragic events of Tuesday morning which claimed the lives of three people.

'She was going to cancel [the photoshoot] because she didn't want to be judged...celebrating her wedding in a scarf while people were terrorised,' said the couple's wedding planner Dina Kheir.

'But she made is a priority to visit the memorial site as the first pit stop,' Ms Kheir said.

A witness said that as the couple approached, clad in their wedding gear, the crowd that had gathered to lay their own floral tributes stared in surprise.

When Ms Kassem, from Punchbowl, placed her bouquet of white roses held together with ribbon at the memorial, the crowd erupted in applause.  

'She did it out of respect for her country, that will one day be the country of her children and grandchildren,' said Ms Kheir.

Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard also joined the steady stream of visitors to pay her respects to mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, who lost their lives in the hostage crisis.

'Deeply moving to pay tribute to Katrina and Tori in Martin Place in Sydney today,' she tweeted on Sunday.

Ms Gillard recently joined the board of mental health organisation beyondblue, the same charity that Mr Johnson's family has asked funds raised in his name to be directed. 

The family of Ms Dawson also confirmed on Saturday that  the Katrina Dawson Foundation had been registered, to honour her achievements.

Ms Dawson was described as one of the 'best and brightest barristers' at the NSW Bar before her untimely death.

Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege on Tuesday would not prevent her legacy from living on.   

NSW Premier Mike Baird said that the Australian government had been in contact with London and Boston, cities which have both housed large-scale floral memorial sites, for advice on how to transport and reconstitute the flowers being laid at the Martin Place memorial site.

The Premier confirmed that the flowers would be preserved and 'clean composted' for a future site to preserve the memory of public compassion and support.

'The NSW Government is in contact with authorities in London and Boston regarding flowers, tributes notes and condolence books to ensure we are operating on prior international best practice.' 

Condolence books will be moved from the city centre to the Opera House and state parliament on Monday. 

They will stay there until the end of January.
