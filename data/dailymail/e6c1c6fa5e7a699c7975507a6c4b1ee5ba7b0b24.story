One of football's great novelties will take place on Thursday afternoon as Mali and Guinea draw lots to decide which will advance from Group D at the Africa Cup of Nations.

The two nations finished joint second behind the Ivory Coast with identical records - they both drew all three of their matches, scored three times and conceded three times.

And so, at 3pm UK time during a Confederation of African Football meeting at the Malabo Hilton hotel, a ball will be picked out of a pot to determine which of the pair will take on Ghana in the quarter-final on Sunday.

Mali and Guinea will learn their Africa Cup of Nations fate when lots are drawn on Thursday afternoon

Guinea coach Michel Dussuyer has been outspoken in his criticism of the drawn lots system 

His Mali counterpart Henryk Kasperczak was in agreement at the harshness of the drawn lots method

A statement on the official tournament website explained the procedure: 

'In pursuant to Article 74 of the regulations of the Orange Africa Cup of Nations, a random draw will be conducted to determine the second place team in Group B, between Mali and Guinea.

'The draw will take place during the meeting of the Organising Committee of the Africa Cup of Nations on Thursday, 29 January 2015 at 16H00 local time at the Hilton Malabo.

'There will be two balls with position two (2) and position three (3), and the representative of the two teams will pick a ball from the pot. The one who picks position two (2) qualifies for the quarter final.' 

The drawing of lots is certainly a cruel way to be eliminated from any football tournament since it comes down entirely to luck rather than skill.

And that's not been lost on the two managers, who have been outspoken in their criticism of this 'last resort' of splitting teams.

'We have to solve the problems of qualification without a drawing of lots,' said the Mali coach Henryk Kasperczak after his team drew 1-1 with Guinea on Wednesday afternoon.

'We must find a more sporting way. This does not correspond to a sporting spirit.'

His Guinea counterpart Michel Dussuyer agreed: 'Mali do not deserve to be eliminated in this way, just as we do not.'

Both camps have endured an agonising wait, with the draw originally due to take place immediately after the match before being moved to Thursday.

It is not without precedent at the Africa Cup of Nations. In 1988, Algeria went through from the group at the expense of the Ivory Coast following the drawing of lots.

And this situation has also arisen at the World Cup on two occasions.

In 1954, a qualifying match between Turkey and Spain played in Rome ended in stalemate and a 14-year-old boy, the son of a stadium employee, was called onto the pitch to draw lots from a trophy.

He picked out Turkey, sending them to the World Cup finals in Switzerland and condemning Spain to a summer at home.

The drawing of lots ceremony will mean an anxious wait for fans of both nations

And at the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland were tied for second place in their group.

Both were guaranteed qualification for the second round but their ranking had to be determined and so Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's second-in-command, drew lots live on television in Rome. 

He inserted a slip of paper bearing each teams' names into each of two orange plastic balls and then marked another two yellow balls with the numbers 2 and 3 for the positions.

He then asked a World Cup hostess in a blue uniform to pull a ball from each bowl. 

The decision proved crucial - Ireland drew Romania in the last 16 and beat them, while the Dutch were paired with eventual winners West Germany and went out.
