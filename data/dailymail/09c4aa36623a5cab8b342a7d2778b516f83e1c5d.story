Arsenal are closing in on a £12million deal for Southampton right-back Calum Chambers.

The highly-rated 19-year-old has only made 23 first team appearances for Southampton but Arsenal have seen enough to recognise his potential.

The Gunners have already signed Mathieu 
Debuchy from Newcastle for £10m but want another right-back after 
allowing Bacary Sagna to join Manchester City - while Carl Jenkinson 
will also be allowed to leave with West Ham interested.
