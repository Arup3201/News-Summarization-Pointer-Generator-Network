Former AFL player Daniel Chicks has released a video from his archives showing ex-Eagles teammate Ben Cousins diving into a crocodile-infested river during a dare.

Daniel 'Chicky' Chicks posted the now-video to social media under the caption 'Here is a classic Cuzzy [Ben Cousins] & Chicky moment back in 2006/7'.

In the footage shot shortly after the West Coast Eagles premiership win in 2006, Cousins jumps into a river in Kunanarra, Western Australia,  despite at least one crocodile clearly visible in the video.

Cousins and Chicks were in the Kimberley region 'for a promotion and autograph session and our hosts took us out House boating one day,' Chicks said.

Chicks said that a 'croc kept sneaking up taking a look at us and we asked about it and our Hosts told us he is the resident fresh water croc'. 

'Cuzzy decided he wanted to wrestle a small Crocodile after we had a few beers - it was fresh water but i give him credit for his courage i must say !!' he wrote in the videos description.

Cousins, who played for the West Coast Eagles and Richmond Tigers during his AFL career, can be seen jumping into the water, and quickly gets back on the boat, before jumping back in again, while Chicks can be seen laughing with a beer in his hand.

'Cuzzy decided to dive in and have a go but as you see the Croc saw him coming and moved as he dived and made a splash which cuzzy saw no doubt,' Chicks said.

'Then without touching the water he was back on Board the House Boat,' he said.

When Cousins jumps in the second time, Chicks pushes his head back under the water as he tries to get back on the deck of the vessel, as his fellow travellers look on.

Chicks wrote under the video that 'I was really concerned my great mate was about to get eaten'.
