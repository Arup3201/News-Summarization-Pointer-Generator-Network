The burned bodies of nine people have been pulled from the wreckage of a Japanese highway tunnel after its roof fell onto moving vehicles and sparked a fire.

The concrete ceiling panels collapsed yesterday deep inside the three-mile long Sasago Tunnel, which is around 50 miles west of Tokyo.

Today, authorities confirmed the deaths but said rescue work had to be 
suspended while the roof was being reinforced to prevent more collapses.

Video footage from cameras inside the tunnel, after the fire was extinguished, showed firefighters picking their way through cement roof panels that collapsed onto vehicles.

Sasago Tunnel is in Otsuki, Yamanashi Prefecture, on a road linking Tokyo to central Japan

Two vehicles caught fire in the accident yesterday morning, and heavy smoke initially hindered rescue efforts.

The location of the accident, about a
mile inside Sasago Tunnel, in Otsuki, Yamanashi Prefecture, was also 
making the work difficult.

Jun Goto, an official at the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, said highway operators are carrying out work to support the remaining panels in the ceiling.

Mr Goto said it's not clear if there are other survivors.

Police and the highway operator 
Central Japan Expressway Co were investigating why the concrete panels 
collapsed. The size of each panel, how many fell and other details about
the collapse were not immediately released.

The nine dead were traveling in three 
vehicles in the tunnel that links the capital to central Japan. The 
tunnel opened in 1977 and is one of many in the mountainous country.

Company President and CEO Takekazu 
Kaneko said that the company was inspecting other tunnels of similar 
structure, including a parallel tunnel for traffic going in the opposite
direction. Both sections of the highway were shut down indefinitely.

Two people suffered injuries in the collapse.
