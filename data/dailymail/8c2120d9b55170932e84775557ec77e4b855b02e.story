Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah died in a house fire sparked by a model of fridge that had a long history of safety problems ignored by the manufacturer, an inquest heard today

A father died saving his children from a blaze caused by a fridge-freezer that the manufacturer knew was a potential fire risk, an inquest heard yesterday.

Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, 36, passed his baby daughter to a neighbour but was overcome as smoke filled the family home.

His wife Jennifer Benjamin, a paediatrician who was on maternity leave, was left in a coma for two weeks but survived along with their three-year-old daughter, who had been pushed out of a window on to a flat roof by her father.

Mrs Benjamin told the inquest that there had been a problem with the Beko fridge-freezer icing up days earlier but she had not had time to call the manufacturer. If Beko had sent her a recall notice about the model – linked to several house fires over the previous seven years – the tragedy would not have happened, she said.

Investigators found the fridge’s manual open at the page containing contact numbers. They discovered that the fire in November 2010 was caused by a fault with the defrost timer mechanism.

Beko, one of Europe’s largest white goods brands, had been aware of a problem with components as far back as 2003 but failed to rectify it, North London Coroner’s Court heard.

In 2007 independent testing firm Intertek recommended a product recall but its conclusions were rejected by Beko. Intertek later amended its rating of the dangers from ‘serious’ to ‘moderate’ meaning no recall was required.

London Fire Brigade had written to Beko following a number of fires on similar fridges, but the Turkish firm recalled the model only after Mr Muthiah’s death.

The Microsoft software engineer was pulled unconscious from the blaze at his home in Wealdstone, North West London but died eight days later. In a statement read to the inquest, his wife said: ‘Since Santosh’s death I am aware that Beko issued a voluntary recall of the relevant fridge-freezer models.‘Had I received notice of this recall I am adamant that I would have acted immediately and contacted the manufacturer.’

Barnet Coroner's Court heard that the fire was caused by a faulty Beko fridge freezer, which the company knew had defects

Dr Benjamin said that the fridge-freezer ‘had been playing up a bit’, adding: ‘I did not think it was anything serious.

‘I
 had got the appliance manual out ready to call up to ask about it but 
did not get round to it because I was... busy with my new baby.

‘As food was not spoiling I did not think [it] an urgent issue.’

Clayton
 Witter, Beko’s managing director between 2002 and 2010, confirmed that 
despite receiving some 15 reports of fires caused by appliances between 
2003 and 2006, the firm did not feel the fault was serious enough to 
warrant a recall.

He told the coroner that Beko did not believe lives were at risk but admitted ‘that may have been the wrong view in hindsight’.

He
 said: ‘I had no particular concern around the fires reported to us at 
that time. Some were component faults where there had been smoke or the 
smell of smoke, but nothing so dramatic.’

Last night Beko issued a 
statement saying none of its current range of appliances is affected by 
the issues surrounding this case.

The firm urged anyone with a 
pre-2007 model to check its website http://refsafety.beko.co.uk to see 
if their product is affected.

The inquest continues.
