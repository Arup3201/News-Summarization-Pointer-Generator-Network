'Glitter bombed': Tim Pawlenty and associates get covered in confetti by activists from Code Pink

Two young activists wanted to make sure Tim Pawlenty remembers what San Francisco is known for: Harvey Milk, gay rights, direct action... and glitter.

Nancy Mancias and Chelsea Byers from the anti-war and liberal group Code Pink approached the Republican presidential hopeful at a book signing in the California city yesterday, where they shouted at him and showered him with pink glitter and confetti.

Ms Mancias shouted at the former governor of Minnesota: 'Where's your courage to stand for gay rights and women's reproductive rights? Where's your courage?'

The word 'courage' is a reference to Mr Pawlenty's new book title, 'Courage to Stand'. He was at the Moscone Center yesterday to sign copies during the American Health Insurance Plans conference.

The former governor has campaigned on his opposition to Barack Obama's healthcare reform.

In January, Mr Pawlenty said that he would support reinstating the controversial 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, which had prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military, and which Congress repealed last year, in part because of pressure from the Obama administration.

In a video made of yesterday's Code Pink protest, which was posted on YouTube, the two activists can be seen effortlessly walking up to Mr Pawlenty's table, which seems essentially free.

Mr Pawlenty can be seen sitting at the table, surrounded by several other men in suits.

Mr Pawlenty can be seen standing up quickly and walking away, while his associates try to push the glitter away.

A man in a police uniform quickly approaches the two women and drives them away from the table.

Ms Mancias turns back toward the table several times, while repeating her original question.

She also shouts, 'Welcome to San Francisco, home of gay hero Harvey Milk. Where's your courage to stand?'

Ms Mancias, who is a Code Pink campaign organizer, told The Bay Citizen afterwards that their protest seemed to catch the candidate off-guard.

She said: 'He sort of looked at us and had this look of "Oh, no". I don't think anyone expected what was coming'

Ms Mancias said they got the idea for the 'glitter bomb' from another protester, Nick Espinosa, who did the same thing to Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich during a book signing in Minneapolis in May.

In the widely circulated video of that protest, Mr Espinosa told Mr Gingrich to 'stop the hate, stop the anti-gay politics'.

Ms Mancias told The Bay Citizen: 'We were inspired by Nick Espinosa and did the same to Tim Pawlenty. Some of these people are so hard to reach, we have to use this to get our message out, confronting them in this fashion'.

Showing a pragmatic side, Ms Mancias admitted that her action is unlikely to change Mr Pawlenty's stance on the issues. But she said she hopes it will focus the public's attention on where he stands.

About throwing glitter, Ms Mancias said: 'It's nonviolent and it looks great. It's just disarming. How can you be mad at anybody who throws glitter?'

Message for T-Paw: Activists play off the title of his new book, 'Courage to Stand'

Got Newt: Mr Gingrich is showered with glitter in May in Minneapolis by a gay rights activist

Code Pink: Women for Peace is an 
anti-war group that was founded in 2002 in response to U.S. military 
involvement in the Middle East. The group is run by and comprised 
primarily of women, who engage in a wide range of in-person and online 
protests, often wearing bright pink.

The group has numerous offices and chapters around the U.S., and some activities worldwide.

It
describes itself as 'a women-initiated grassroots peace and social 
justice movement working to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, stop 
new wars, and redirect our resources into healthcare, education, green 
jobs and other life-affirming activities'.

Code
Pink got a dramatic start in November 2002 by conducting a four-month 
vigil in front of the White House, calling for peace and attracting a 
who's who in the anti-war movement.

The
name Code Pink is a reference to the United States Department of 
Homeland Security's now-discontinued colour-coded terror alert system.
