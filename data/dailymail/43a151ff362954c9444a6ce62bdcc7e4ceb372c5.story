A Blond robber in dark glasses  casually points a gun at a terrified  bank manager as she claims a stack of gold bullion.

It may sound like the kind of scene you would hope to shield youngsters from – but this is actually a toy set aimed at children from four to ten.

Anti-gun campaigners have hit out at Playmobil over its Bank and Safe pack, which comes with all the pieces needed to stage a violent heist, including a safe that opens to reveal a haul of valuables and armed bank robber figurines.

The German manufacturer claims the toy, on sale for around £35, encourages children to ‘imagine, invent, create’. 

But Danny Bryan of Communities Against Gun and Knife Crime, which works 
to help youngsters avoid lives  of violence, said: ‘We don’t want to be 
encouraging young people to look at these sorts of things.

'I think it is
 horrendous that young people are given all these images to shape them. 
It is sending out the wrong message.’

Aimed at 
children aged four to 10, the set includes gold bars, cash, a big bag to
 put the loot in, a pistol and a screwdriver to wrench open the cash 
point machine.

A description of the set on The Early Learning Centre website read: ‘Watch out. The bank
 robber is after all the money in the bank and is demanding the key to 
the safe - what will the bank manager do?’

The centre writes that the set is not
 suitable for children under four-years-old - due to small parts, never 
mind the re-acting of a violent crime.

A Toys R Us spokesperson was unavailable to comment.

German company Playmobil has caused controversy before, manufacturing construction worker play sets which come complete with shovels, tools and three crates of what appears to be beer.

And this is not the first time toys have been considered controversial and inappropriate before.

Last year police swooped on a shopkeeper’s business and seized a cache of gun-shaped calculators because they feared they could be used in a robbery.

The 30 calculators were among a haul of toy guns confiscated by police in a raid on a warehouse in Sherborne, Dorset, which is owned by shopkeeper Mark Ashley Miller.

Mr Ashley-Miller, who runs the gift shop The Present Finder, was stunned when officers descended on his warehouse and confiscated £1,140 of stock.

They were seized after someone saw the toys on sale on The Present Finder’s website and made a complaint to firearms police.

Back in 2007 Lego upset fans by giving some of its play figures, including stormtroopers, robots and Batman characters, realistic-looking guns and pistols.
