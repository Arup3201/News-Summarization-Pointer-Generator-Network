An ex-CFO and Chick-fil-A protestor who lost his job after posting a video rant against one of the chain's employees  has since lost his home and lives on food stamps.

Adam Mark Smith, 37, who worked for an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, was shamed after the 2012 YouTube video was posted showing him berating employee Rachel Elizabeth.

The video which expressed his disdain over the firm's anti-gay marriage stance went viral, and left him unemployed and forced to lose his home.

Nearly three years later, the married father of four is still searching for a job and his family previously had to give away possessions before he was hired and fired again, according to ABC.

Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain's anti-gay marriage stance

Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family)

At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired.

His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. 

Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV.

But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later.

'I felt like, "yeah, I got it. I am back'',' he said.

However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video.

In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there

Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted

As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth.

While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water: Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity.

The controversy surrounding one of America's biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A's COO Dan T. Cathy.

Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage.

Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports.

In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage.

When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded 'Well, guilty as charged’.

He also stated that Chick-fil-A is runs on 'traditional Christian values' and is 'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit'.

In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country.

The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to 'true wealth'.

In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again.

In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm's support for traditional Christian marriage.

Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange.

He said: 'I don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.'

Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: 'I'm staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don't belong in the workplace.'

As he drives off he tells the worker: 'I'm a nice guy by the way, and I'm totally heterosexual. Just can't stand the hate. It's gotta stop guys, stand up.'

Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked.

Smith told 20/20: 'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, 'Adam, what did you do?', she said. 'The voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats.'' 

After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc.

They released a statement saying: 'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions.

In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace

Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled

'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.'

After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth.

'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,' said Smith in the video.

'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure.

'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.'

Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks 'Chick-fil-A's Appreciation Day' and lost his cool.

Shown Smith's apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it.

She said: 'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape. 'I feel sorry for him and his family, and for everything that has happened to him since.'
