'We believe Twitter is valuable to everybody on the planet': Twitter boss Dick Costolo has revealed his plans for global social network domination

The chief executive of Twitter has revealed he wants the microblogging site to be as big as Facebook - with one billion users.

Dick Costolo reignited the row with his company's most bitter rival by taking aim at the milestone Facebook only reached in October after nine years of operation.

Twitter only has 500million users and has been running for seven years.

Mr Costolo, 49, said: ‘I don't think about our goals in terms of other companies.

‘Where we want to get to is human scale, global scale. That's a billion users, not where we are today.

'We're the size that 99.9 per cent of the other companies would like to be, but we believe Twitter is valuable to everybody on the planet.’

Twitter and Facebook are bitter rivals and last year came to blows over photo sharing service Instagram.

Facebook eventually bought the site for $1billion but only after talks with Twitter for a $525million plus Twitter stocks deal fell through.

According to the New York Times, Instagram chief executive Kevin Systrom had agreed a verbal deal with Twitter before Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg intervened.

Mr Costolo said that once people become core users Twitter is ‘indispensable'.

But he admitted: ‘You have to invest, frankly, too much to get that "aha" moment.

‘One of the things that we're spending a great deal of time on are weekly digest emails for casual users. It's a great way for people to start realizing, "that's amazing and I need to be checking in more frequently."

On the up: Twitter only has 500million users - half as many as Facebook - and has been running for seven years

The new video-sharing service on Twitter has already been inundated with pornographic footage.

One hardcore clip appeared as the editor’s pick at the top of the home page of Vine.

Word spread and the footage soon received a ‘popular now’ ranking. The risqué video was posted by a user called NSFWVine – a reference to the ‘not safe for work’ warning some users deploy when posting sexually explicit content.

It is just one of the hundreds of short porn videos which have appeared on the site since it launched last Thursday.

The social networking service apologised for what it said had been a mistake with the editor’s pick but refused to automatically take down explicit clips – saying that would be censorship.

The Twitter boss did discuss the tit-for-tat scraps with Facebook that have made their feud bitter and very public.

In one such conflict, Instagram shut off an option that let Twitter users show Instagram pictures, prompting Twitter to introduce its own photo filters to encourage users to switch away from Instagram.

Commentators have dubbed the row ‘The Photo Wars’ as they are over photo sharing applications for smartphones and computers.

In the interview with the Wall Street Journal Mr Costolo also told of his excitement at buying video startup Vine, and said it was ‘not necessarily inevitable’ that Twitter would follow Facebook and go public.

Facebook’s stock market floatation was the most disastrous in living memory and sparked a £1.8billionn lawsuit against the company and Zuckerberg himself

Mr Costolo said: ‘There are lots of different choices companies can make now.

‘A couple of years ago (Twitter) had a large private financing, and you're seeing other companies do that now. I think that's great.

‘It affords companies a lot of different ways to think about financing growth.’
