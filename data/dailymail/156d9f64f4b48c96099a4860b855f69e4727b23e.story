Decider: The US is mobilising a coalition of allies around a potential bombing campaign in Syria.

Other potential US allies listed in the report included Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

Daily Mail Australia has approached Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office for comment.

A report published The Australian on Monday said the Abbott Government is contemplating an extended military role in Iraq.

The report also said the government has encouraged the United States to ramp up its involvement in the troubled country and possibly Syria.
