Republican Senator Marco Rubio says that despite his relative youth and claims that he's inexperienced, he is absolutely ready and qualified to be president, should he decide to run in the 2016 election.

The 43-year-old Florida senator just got back from a New Hampshire - one of several states viewed as crucial in a presidential primary - where he told crowds that Democrats are killing the American Dream as he bashed potential Democratic opponents like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

'They're threatening to nominate someone now who wants to take us to the past â€” to an era that's gone and never coming back,' Rubio told the Rockingham County Republican Committee on Friday, a reference, of course, to Clinton. 'The road we're on right now is a road that will rob us of the American dream.'

Ready: Florida Senator Marco Rubio - at 43 years old - says he's ready to be president of the United States

The appearance marks the clearest sign yet of Rubio's interest in a 2016 presidential bid as he beefs up political organization and charts an aggressive role in this fall's midterm elections.

In an interview with ABC's This Week, Rubio added even more fuel to the speculation that he's planning a run for president by telling host Jonathan Karl that he has plenty of experience to hold the country's highest office.

'But I think that's true for multiple other people that would want to 
run,' he said. 'I mean I'll be 43 
this month, but the other thing that perhaps people don't realize, I've 
served now in public office for the better part of 14 years.'

However, Rubio acknowledged that there several good Republican candidates who voters may also want to consider.

'The question is, who's vision is the one that our party wants to follow?' Rubio says, adding that 'Most importantly, I think a president has to have a clear vision of 
where the country needs to go and clear ideas about how to get it 
there.'

Rubio says that he plans to make his decision about whether to run by the end of the year, and that if he does run  he 'will not have some sort of exit strategy to run for the Senate. I believe that if you want to be president of the United States, 
you run for president.'

Is she or isn't she: Speculation continues to swirl around whether Clinton will fun for president in 2016

As for Clinton, Rubio says she failed as a secretary of state, primarily for her handling of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack that took the lives of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

'If you look at the diplomacy that was pursued in her time in the State Department, it has failed everywhere in the world,' Rubio said. 'So here's what I would say, if she is going to run on her record as secretary of state, she is also going to have to answer for its massive failures.'
