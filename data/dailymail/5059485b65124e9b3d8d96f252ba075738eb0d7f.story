The cold weather currently gripping the nation has cancelled work, scrapped flights and ruined plans for millions - but one man refuses to be cowed by Mother Nature.

Fraser Cunningham, a 56-year-old engineer, has been cycling to work every single day for the past eighteen months.

And even though the temperature in his home town of Madeira, Ohio, has plunged as low as -10°F in recent weeks the biting cold hasn't stopped him pedaling the 16 and a half miles to work and back while others shiver at home.

Taking the sub-zero way: Fraser Cunningham, 56, is pictured above on his 17-mile cycle ride to work. When he left his home in Madeira, Ohio, it was -10°F

Something on your face: Cunningham, an engineer for General Electric, wears protective gear, but can't stop icicles forming on his voluminous beard during the cycle

Wrapped in thermals, a protective coat, two pairs of gloves, a helmet - and his voluminous beard - Cunningham spends as long as two hours each way to his job at General Electric.

Nonetheless, his commute on Friday was so bitter that his eyelids froze open as he rode.

When he shows up around 7.30 each morning, shivering and sporting huge icicles in his beard, his first stop in the bathroom to melt away the damage with warm water.

And with another bout of snow predicted this week in a seemingly relentless winter, Cunningham's dedication is likely to be tested again. 

When the going gets tough: In cold weather, Cunningham's trip can take as long as two hours. To combat icy roads, he swaps to his 'fat bike', which has monster tires less likely to slip

Precarious: In Dallas, the semi truck was left dangling off the I-45 highway as icy roads coated the region

This, and more of this: Cunningham is used to the biting cold - but southern states like Arkansas, the state capitol of which is pictured, have also had unwonted blasts of snow

More to come: Through Wednesday rain and snow could still fall across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama

Getting chilly: Snow could return to the mid-Atlantic region Wednesday night, hitting Virginia, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama

Explaining his cast-iron commitment, he said: 'I’m going to characterize myself as a bit of a stubborn person.'

'Getting in the car (to go to work) is an option, but only in an absolute, dire emergency.'

The option has, rarely, been taken before - he missed his last cycle on July 22, 2013, and his continuous record is around 20 months.

He switched to cycling more than a decade ago, and says he will continue until he retires.

Cunningham's show of resilience in the cold comes as yet another snowstorm is predicted in the relentless march of bad weather that has left all but two states with snow on the ground.

Chill: Pictured above, a man uses a snow blower in La Plata County, Colorado, where two feet fell Monday

Totals: Snow could fall in all the above locations by Thursday - leaving Florida potentially the only U.S. state with no snow at all

First-timers? These kids in Tyler, Texas, were dealing with snow as well Monday when they crossed the street

Given up: Schoolbuses took kids home early in Tyler after the school district called it quits due to bad weather

Snowy: In Oxford, Mississippi, this student made his way across the state university campus in the Monday snow

Forecasters say the fourth wintry blast in quick succession could sweep into the south and move up the Atlantic coast later this week.

According to the Weather Channel, northern Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama could be snow-hit Tuesday.

By Wednesday the precipitation is expected to drift north into Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia.

According to many assessments, South Carolina could also be hit with some snowfall - which would leave Florida the only U.S. state with no snow on the ground. 

Though the fresh totals are mainly expected to be three inches at most, some areas such as Raleigh, North Carolina, could be hit by up to eight.

Coverage: According to The Weather Company, snow is on is on the ground in 48 out of 50 states - with only Florida and South Carolina currently bar

Boxing clever: Some small children take advantage of the unseasonably cold temperatures in Enid, Oklahoma, to head down the side of the north Van Buren overpass in their cardboard sled

Dangers: Dallas firefighters respond to an accident on Central Expressway on Monday as freezing rain affected travel in nearly half of Texas and winter storm warnings were issued in the northern part of the state

Fort frigid: Downtown Fort Worth, Texas, was quiet as sleet and freezing temperatures hit the area on Monday
