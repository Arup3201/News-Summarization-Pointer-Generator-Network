It is a job that would move the most mild-mannered soul to explode in a Malcolm Tucker-esque burst of coarse cussing a dozen times a day. 

If you can’t deal with a steady stream of frustrations, don’t ever move into coaching - it’ll break your heart *and* send you halfway round the twist.

Take Vern Cotter’s experiences yesterday. He’s picked his XV to take on England at Twickenham, the toughest test of this exasperating Six Nations campaign.

Vern Cotter has had a difficult time of things, with Alex Dunbar picking up a late injury before Saturday's game

Coach Cotter said the 24-year-old centre Dunbar had played a key role in the Scotland XV

He’s watching the boys run through their paces in the final training session before catching a lunchtime flight to London, when Alex Dunbar – without another player within touching distance – changes direction and crumples to the turf.

Suddenly one of his key men, a wrecking ball in attack and a bear in defence, is out not just of tomorrow’s Calcutta Cup clash, but the rest of this season – possibly including the World Cup.

Stern Vern has to move from barking orders to comforting a young man facing up to a potential six months in rehab. If he didn’t believe in voodoo, hoodoos, juju and jinxes before he took the Scotland gig …

‘We’re a team who don’t get things easy,’ said Cotter, looking more than a little shaken by the turn of events. ‘It’s another example of it.

‘It’s the kind of thing that can happen any time, of course. I will give you an example. Thursday training when I was in charge at Clermont, we had finished, I’d blown my whistle. Wesley Fofana and Jason White were running, laughing, Wesley tackles Jason and breaks his leg. These are just the things that happen, unfortunately.’

Cotter’s declaration that the squad may be brought closer together by the sudden loss of Dunbar - his team-mates moved to win one for the Gipper, so to speak - is understandable. It does no-one any good to start tearing cloth and weeping over the absence of one player, however influential.

Matt Scott has ability and form enough to deputise, definitely, while recalls for Jim Hamilton at lock and David Denton at No8 should help Scotland in their bid to do something pretty ambitious – out-England the English big men.

How England and Scotland will line up for Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash

‘England are a big physical team and they play a very percentage-orientated game, based on occupation, field position and a strong pack,’ said Cotter. ‘They also have very good finishers in their team, strong runners, line breakers. So they are a team based around their power, their line-out and their scrum.

‘We’ve been looking at trying to compete – and put them under pressure in what they consider to be their strong points. Hopefully if we can contest there and keep the game as tight as possible for as long as possible, you never know.

‘Ireland got on top of them around the rucks and I think they will be more aggressive in that area to get the go-forward they didn’t get against Ireland. Ireland shut down their passing game and got them into an arm wrestle.

‘Defensively, Ireland played very well against them and didn’t let them put in several passes. They will have worked on how to counter those tactics. First and foremost, we look at our contact zone and our set piece. We have to be able to adapt.

‘We also need to be better in the air. We have known that since the start of the six Nations. We know that they use the ball in the air a fair bit.

‘Jim Hamilton is there for his experience. He knows their players very well and I think he may be able to unsettle them with his individual knowledge. He is there to give us that solid base at scrum and lineout.’

Dougie Fife wins just his fifth cap on the right wing, given the chance partly due to a Sean Maitland injury but also because Cotter likes ‘his energy, enthusiasm, his kick-chase,’ adding: ‘He is a young player who is strong, creates line breaks and is a finisher as well. It was tight, but we think his energy, especially in the aerial game, will be important.’

Alex Dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after injuring his knee at training

Cotter spoke in the aftermath of the home defeat to Italy about the brutal honesty required in order to fix the problems so obviously exposed, although he plays down any notion that he’s been tearing his players limb from metaphorical limb this week.

Instead, he says that suffering that late loss might even be of long-term benefit to his squad, pointing out: ‘We were two minutes away from lauding the character of a young team for getting out of a tough situation with a scrum penalty.

‘In a lot of ways it has been a bit of a blessing because we can really look in depth at things that may have been ignored or smoothed over. We have had a good look at ourselves. Everybody. The coaches, the players, everybody.’

Addressing those promises of a bloody inquest into the worst performance of the campaign, he added: ‘Those things are always a little exaggerated. We were just very clear on what we want to see and what we expect. We need to learn from certain things. That was the theme behind this week’s training.

‘This weekend, there is the Calcutta Cup and the result two weeks ago. That means there has been more of an edge to training. It is always nice to have an objective.

‘We are two days away from playing for something that we could bring home. It has been a few years since Scotland won at Twickenham. No one is giving us much of a chance. I can understand that. But we will be measuring our improvements from two weeks ago and those things will help us develop our game and become more competitive.’

Hardly a rousing cri de coeur aimed at whipping his men into a frenzy. But, then, maybe he’s saving all his fired-up frustrations for the pre-match address. As the Six Nations rolls on to the penultimate weekend of the campaign, Cotter may have enough fuel left to strip the paint from the walls of Twickenham.
