A beauty queen has undergone a radical and unusual change of direction, by becoming champion 'banger' racer

Jemma Kerr spends her days working in a Blackpool hospital but in her spare time she has a strange hobby - she’s a top racing driver.

The Miss Blackpool finalist competes in dangerous 'banger racing', in which drivers take to the track in battered old cars which have failed their MOTs, and try to crash each other out of the race.

Jemma used to compete in beauty pageants, even being crowned Miss Blackpool, before starting racing

The 21-year-old student says racing is just something the family has always done

Jemma has only been racing for eight years but has an impressive record of more than 50 victories and countless medals under her belt.

This year alone she has won 10 races and taken home two trophies.

The student says the need for speed is in her blood and blames her dad,John, 61, and big brother, Anthony, 27, who have also raced all of their lives.

The 21 year-old, from Thornton, Lancashire, said: 'I love the adrenaline rush I get from racing.

'It’s so much fun and I have made so many friends through it. I race against men and women, but I prefer racing against the male drivers.

A far cry from the glamour of pageants, banger racing leaves competitors covered in mud splatter

Unlike most of her competitors, Jemma wears a custom pink helmet when she drives

'It is much more competitive. They probably don’t like losing to a woman though - but I think they have a lot of respect for me on the track.

'My dream is to make it to the National Bangers. It’s a lot more brutal, there’s a lot more contact - it’s more like a Demolition Derby.'

Jemma races against both men and women at around 15 meets a year, driving in a gruelling three races per meet.

But most of her time is spent rebuilding and repairing her car for the next race and she admits she is a dab hand with a spanner and wrench.

Jemma is currently studying to be a pharmacist technician at Blackpool Victoria Hospital

She said: 'I do get some shocked reactions when I tell people about what I do.

'My friends don’t believe me and when I show them pictures they tell me I’m crazy.

'If I go out wearing my overalls after a race, covered in dirt, people just stop and stare at me.'

She said: 'I will have to work weekends when I’m fully qualified but I will make sure I can keep racing.

'I will find a way to work around it. I have no plans to stop any time soon.'
