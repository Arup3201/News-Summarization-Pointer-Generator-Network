Positive early buzz surrounding the much anticipated Bible epic 'Noah' starring Russell Crowe could mean huge crowds — and box office receipts — once the film opens to wide release on Friday.

Although artistic liberties are taken, the movie, which had a reported budget of $130 million, tells the story of Noah, made famous in the Bible after God commanded him to build an ark prior to a giant flood that would destroy the earth. The film also stars Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson.

With 11 reviews posted, 'Noah' has a 73% fresh rating on the popular film reviews site rottentomatoes.com, with 8 reviews being positive.

In his review for the Hollywood Reporter, Jeff McCarthy calls the film 'an arresting piece of filmmaking that has a shot at capturing a large international audience both for its fantasy-style spectacle and its fresh look at an elemental Bible story most often presented as a kiddie yarn. He also mentions that the word 'God' is never mentioned in any of the dialogue.

Although he found 'Noah' uneven, Variety chief film critic Scott Foundas nonetheless gave a generally favorable review.

'Counterintuitive, perhaps, but by no means sacrilegious, [director Darren] Aronofsky’s uneven but undeniably bold, personal, visually extravagant take on the Old Testament tale will surely polarize critics and audiences while riding a high sea of curiosity to strong initial worldwide B.O.,' Foundas wrote. 'Only time — and word of mouth — will tell if it can stay the course for anywhere near 40 days and nights.'

Foundas added that Crowe's acting was 'superbly played.'

Perhaps the most glowing review came from Pete Hammond at Movieline as he called 'Noah' 'magnificent.'

'Truly epic in its scope and ambition,' Hammond said in his video review. 'It stays with you long after you leave the theatre. This 'Noah' is unlike any other film of its kind — an intimate and stirring new take on a biblical story we only thought we knew.'

Even the National Catholic Register liked the film. It reviewer, Steven D. Greydanus, wrote, 'For a lifelong Bible geek and lover of movie-making and storytelling like me, Noah is a rare gift: a blend of epic spectacle, startling character drama and creative reworking of Scripture and other ancient Jewish and rabbinic writings.'

He added that 'Noah' 'presents biblical characters facing challenges, dilemmas and uncertainties as knotty as those we face today.'

Some critics, however, didn't find the film pleasing. Alonso Duralde, chief critic for The Wrap.com, compared Noah to Kevin Kostner's 1995 sci-fi adventure dud Waterworld.

'The film winds up feeling like a bit of a soggy slog, both overblown and underwritten,' Duralde wrote.

Director Aronofsky, who reportedly was working on getting 'Noah' to the big screen for 15 years, made a name for himself in late 2010 following the release of 'Black Swan,' starting Natalie Portman. The movie ended up as box office gold, grossing more than $329 million worldwide. The take is even more astounding given the film's budget was $13 million, a pittance in Hollywood.

The story of Noah was brought to the silver screen before, back in 1928 as the disaster film 'Noah's Ark,' which was written by Daryl F. Zanuck, who later became a famed Hollywood studio executive. During the filming of the climactic flood scene, three extras drowned.
