A female High Court Judge in Bosnia who was sacked after she stripped off naked and laid down on her office desk to sunbathe has been given her job back.

Enisa Bilajac, 35, had been spotted exercising in the nude while in her office before courts began.  Later she was seen naked on her desk.

The judge was photographed from the council offices across the road in the capital city of Sarajevo.

A Bosnian High Court judge has been given her job back after she was sacked when she was pictured naked in her office

The judge was fired following an internal enquiry when an image of her was published in local media

The picture was then published in local media, sparking an internal enquiry at the court building.

The matter ended up with the disciplinary commission of the Supreme Court, and she was fired after it ruled her behaviour had 'damaged the image of the Supreme Court'.

The report said:  'Her behaviour as a senior judge was not acceptable.'

She said she had not expected any staff to be in the building opposite at that time

The Supreme Court Council ultimately decided she had not acted incorrectly and had not intended to harm her professional credibility, and she has been reinstated

The woman said however that her office door had been locked, and she was entitled to exercise as a way of warming up for the day ahead.

She said she had not expected any staff to be in the building opposite at that time.

The Supreme Court Council ultimately decided she had not acted incorrectly and had not intended to harm her professional credibility, and she has been reinstated.
