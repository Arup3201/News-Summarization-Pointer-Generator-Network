The Obama administration took steps Wednesday to cut levels of smog-forming pollution linked to asthma, lung damage and other health problems, bringing jeers from business leaders who warn of trillions in compliance costs and millions of lost jobs.

And evidence shows that a shifting regulatory environment could drive hundreds of U.S. counties over the new limit – for no reason other than their proximity to China's out-of-control smokestack society.

Energy and industry trade groups painted the government's move as a roadblock that threatens to jeopardize manufacturing's comeback in the U.S. And Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe, who will take over the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in January, is vowing 'vigorous oversight' of the plan.

Louisiana Sen. David Vitter said Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency's planned move 'will shut down job-creating projects in every state.'

Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, warned that 'tightening these standards could be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the American public, with potentially enormous costs to the economy, jobs, and consumers.'

Gerard and other business leaders accused the Obama administration of moving the goalposts, since states are still working to implement the previous standard put in place in 2008 by President George W. Bush.

But green groups say it's all just spin.

'We've heard the sky-is-falling rhetoric before,' Environmental Defense Fund senior scientist Elena Craft told Politico.

'And in every case, American ingenuity and creativity have allowed us to move on and to do the things that we need to do to get those control measures in place and to bring cleaner and healthier air to all Americans.'

“We know that the science and the law is clear,' she said. 'So we expect EPA to do their job and protect public health.'

The nuts and bolts of the Environmental Protection Agency's new plan seem modest on the surface: The agency will move to a new, lower threshold for ozone pollution of between 65 and 70 parts per billion, lowering it from 75.

The EPA could, however, push the legal level down as far as 60 parts per billion, a level sought by environmental activists.

Dropping the limbo bar even 5 points could draw new legal challenges from western U.S. states where studies show Chinese factories are dumping enough ozone and other pollution to push them over the new limit. 

A 2012 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research found that pollution wafting across the Pacific Ocean from East Asia can contribute up to 20 percent of the ground-level ozone measured in California and elsewhere.

The Princeton University-led research team determined that in the springtime, Asia's dirty air adds between 8 and 15 parts per billion of ozone to atmospheric measurements in the U.S. 

If nothing else, an industry analyst told MailOnline on Wednesday, lowering permissible ozone levels across the country could put west-coast states at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new businesses.

The six U.S. cities and towns with the highest ground-level ozone levels are all in California, according to the American Lung Association.

In July Chinese officials recorded the worst smog days in Hong Kong's history.

South Dakota Sen. John Thune has introduced a bill that would tie the EPA's hands and force it to postpone its plan.

'I expect there to be strong, bipartisan opposition to what will be the most expensive EPA regulation in history,' Thune said Monday in a statement. 

Legislation co-sponsor Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican senator, complained Wednesday that 'as Americans prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving with their friends and families, the Obama Administration has taken the opportunity to roll out what some experts estimate could be the most expensive regulation ever.'

'Almost 9 million people are still looking for good-paying jobs nationwide. The last thing workers and families in Missouri need is yet another burdensome regulation that will further stifle jobs and economic opportunity.'

In 2010 the EPA proposed setting the permissible ozone levels in the air to somewhere between 60 to 70 parts per billion. That level would have doubled the number of U.S. counties who violate the rule. 

In addition to America's smog capitals like Los Angeles and Dallas, smaller regions including a county in Kansas with a population of just 3,000 would find themselves facing fines – and passing costs on to businesses.

There's broad disagreement about how much the EPA's new plan will cost industry, and whether all those costs will ultimately be borne by consumers. 

Business groups say it would be nearly impossible for oil refineries and large manufacturers to comply without going bankrupt.

A study commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers determined that America's Gross Domestic Product will shrink by $270 billion per year and carry a compliance price tag of $2.2 trillion, while wiping out $3.4 trillion in economic output and 2.9 million jobs by the end of 2040.

'This would be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the American public,' the NAM said in July. Its main concern is the difficulty a new clean-air standard would pose for companies looking to open new manufacturing plants. 

By federal law, the EPA is required to make its recommendations and set policy without considering the costs.

The agency claims industry will only have to spend about $3.9 billion in 2025, the first year the new regulation would take effect, if the standard of 70 parts per billion holds. That cost, the EPA says, would grow to $15 billion if the final rule sets the limit at 65 parts per billion.

EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Associated Press that lower ozone standards would actually spur more businesses, investment and jobs by making communities healthier, repeating the administration's long-held view that government-nudged green investment is a net economic gain.

'Critics play a dangerous game when they denounce the science and law EPA has used to defend clean air for more than 40 years,' she wrote in an op-ed for CNN's website. 'The American people know better.'

In a statement Wednesday, she insisted that 'bringing ozone pollution standards in line with the latest science will clean up our air, improve access to crucial air quality information, and protect those most at-risk.' 

'It empowers the American people with updated air quality information to protect our loved ones – because whether we work or play outdoors – we deserve to know the air we breathe is safe.' 

McCarthy's EPA is under a court-ordered Dec. 1 deadline to issue its new smog standard. 

The proposal will also fulfill a pledge President Obama made during his first White House campaign – one that he reneged on during a contentious 2012 re-election campaign.
