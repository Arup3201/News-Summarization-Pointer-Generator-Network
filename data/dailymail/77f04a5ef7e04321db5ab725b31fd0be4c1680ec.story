The inquiry into Establishment child abuse could take up to four years to complete, its new chairman has revealed. 

Lowell Goddard, a High Court judge in New Zealand, said leading the probe was the 'biggest challenge' she has ever faced as she set out plans to start in April.  

The inquiry has already lost two potential heads, Baroness Butler-Sloss and Dame Fiona Woolf, who stood aside amid concerns over their establishment links.

Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to scour the globe to find a chairman for the inquiry, after fears leading figures in the UK would be seen as too close to the Establishment.

Giving evidence to MPs, Judge Goddard, the third chair-designate of the Statutory Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, told the Home Affairs Select Committee she was reluctant to set a timescale for the inquiry as this stage.

But she said it had been indicated when she took the job that it could take 'three years, possibly into a fourth'.

She added: 'Given the breadth of the subject matter and the timespan involved, that does not seem inordinate.

'It is a long time but what will be important, in my view, is to carefully scope the inquiry to see how it should be managed and to inform along the way of the progress of the inquiry and perhaps to set milestones for interim reports.' 

Mrs May has insisted she is confident that thorough checks have been carried out to ensure there are no conflicts of interest that could undermine her appointment.

Mrs Goddard, arriving at Parliament to give evidence to MPs, said the inquiry was her biggest ever challenger

Labour MP Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, asked Judge Goddard: 'Would you regard yourself as being part of the establishment?'

She replied: 'We don't have such a thing in my country and I did have to ask carefully what is meant by it so that I did understand what I was being asked to disclose.

'My understanding is do I have any links into any institution or any person relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry? And no, I don't.'

Judge Goddard said she arrived in the UK yesterday and had already met the Home Secretary and sex abuse survivor groups.

She told the committee she will step down from her full-time job as a judge in New Zealand and relocate to the UK for the duration of the inquiry, although she has yet to be awarded a work permit.

Her husband will join her in the UK as often as he can, but her grown up children will remain in New Zealand.

'It is the biggest challenge I have faced yet,' she told MPs.   

The Home Office received more than 150 nominations from survivors, their representatives, MPs and members of the public, Mrs May said.

The Foreign Office was also tasked with combing the Commonwealth to identify any suitable candidates from abroad.

It will be a new statutory inquiry, and not a Royal Commission as some victims had hoped. With a legal status set out under the 2005 Inquiries Act, it will have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence.

Ministers scoured the globe in search of a suitable chairman for the child abuse inquiry, after two previous appointees resigned over links to the British Establishment.

The Foreign Office approached all Commonwealth countries, and the decision was made to appoint Justice Lowell Goddard, a serving High Court judge in New Zealand.

The 66-year-old helped to establish the HELP Clinic for sexual abuse victims, and helped to change the way New Zealand police dealt with abuse cases.

In 2007 she was appointed chairman of the Independent Police Conduct Authority.

During her tenure the authority released a report on the outcome of its inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases, which had begun in August 2009.

She has also served as an independent expert to the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'She is an outstanding candidate with experience in challenging authority in this field, having led with distinction an inquiry into police handling of child abuse cases in New Zealand.'

Married to QC John Hodson, Miss Goddard has three step-children, and one daughter from her first marriage. She breeds and races horses. 

Last week Mrs May announced the original inquiry would be axed and replaced with a new panel.

She conceded that not every victim would be happy with what she announced today.

But she told MPs: 'Let me be clear. I am now more determined than ever to expose the people behind these despicable crimes and the people in institutions that knew about abuse but didn't act, that failed to help when it was their duty, sometimes their very purpose to do so.

'And the people and institutions that in some cases positively covered up evidence of abuse. 

'What we have seen so far in Rotherham, Oxford, Greater Manchester and elsewhere is only the tip of the iceberg.

'With every passing day, with every new revelation, it is clear that sexual abuse of child has taken and is taking place on a scale that we still cannot fully comprehend.' 

She said the authorities had 'let down too many' victims over many years, telling MPs: 'I cannot stand here and say there has been no cover-up.'

At the time she said the inquiry will take longer than 12 months, but must not be allow to 'go on endlessly', Mrs May added.

She will urge Miss Goddard to set a date to publish a report, to prevent a repeat of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war which has not been published after six years.

The inquiry has been dogged with problems since it was first announced by Mrs May last summer.

The panel of experts was created to examine evidence that successive governments, charities, political parties, the NHS, the BBC and the Church failed to protect children from paedophiles. 

But it has failed to make any significant progress after losing not one but two chairman.  

The first person appointed to lead the inquiry was Baroness Butler-Sloss, who stood down in July last year amid questions over the role played by her late brother, Lord Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s.

Her replacement Dame Fiona Woolf then resigned following a barrage of criticism over her 'Establishment links', most notably in relation to former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died last month.

Before his death, Lord Brittan had been seen as a key witness to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring.  

The Government's inquiry into historical child abuse has been plagued with controversy since it was established last year. Here are the key events:

Monday July 7: Home Secretary Theresa May announces she will establish an independent inquiry under an expert panel to examine the handling of allegations of paedophilia by state institutions as well as bodies such as the BBC, churches and political parties. It will be chaired by 'an appropriately senior and experienced figure', she tells the House of Commons.

Tuesday July 8: Baroness Butler-Sloss is named as the chairwoman but questions are raised about the choice as her brother, Sir Michael Havers, was in the Cabinet in the 1980s as attorney general.

Leon Brittan, who died last month, had been seen as a key witness likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry

Saturday July 12: Claims emerge that Baroness Butler-Sloss once refused to go public about a bishop implicated in a scandal. She is reported to have told a victim of alleged abuse she did not want to include their claims in a review of how the Church of England dealt with two paedophile priests because she 'cared about the Church' and 'the press would love a bishop'. 

Monday July 14: Downing Street announces that Baroness Butler-Sloss has decided to quit. 

Friday September 5: The Lord Mayor of the City of London, Fiona Woolf, a former president of the Law Society of England and Wales, is named as the new chairman. 

Sunday September 7: The Mail on Sunday reveals links between Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan, who was likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry over a dossier he received from Mr Dickens in 1983, documenting the alleged involvement of VIP figures in a child sex ring. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has led the campaign for an inquiry, says Mrs Woolf's position would be 'untenable' if she was close to the Brittans.

Monday September 8: Downing Street says Prime Minister David Cameron continues to have 'strong support' for the appointment.

Tuesday October 21: Mrs May insists she has confidence in the inquiry chairwoman after Mrs Woolf gives details of her links to Lord Brittan. Mrs Woolf insists there is nothing in the encounters that would stop her chairing the wide-ranging probe.

Giving evidence later to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mrs Woolf insists she has 'gone the extra distance' to declare every possible issue to reassure victims and does not have a 'close association' with the former Cabinet minister.

Wednesday October 22: As pressure mounts on Mrs Woolf to stand down, a photograph surfaces showing her chatting to Lady Brittan at a prize-giving in October 2013 - she had previously stated that she had had 'no social contact with Lord and Lady Brittan since April 23 2013'.

Friday October 31: Mrs Woolf quits down as head of the inquiry, after victims' representatives issued a unanimous call for her to be replaced.

Monday November 3: Mrs May apologies to survivors during a Commons statement and says she will meet survivors before appointing a new chair.

Tuesday November 11: A key review into the Home Office's handling of allegations finds there is no evidence of organised attempts to conceal child abuse. It came after it emerged the department 'lost or destroyed' 114 files between 1979 and 1999.

Thursday December 4: A number of alleged victims write to Mrs May saying they will withdraw from the inquiry unless the Government makes major changes to it.

Sunday December 21: Survivors say they welcome an indication from the Home Secretary that the inquiry will be given statutory powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence.

Wednesday January 21:  Leon Brittan dies as the age of 75.

Wednesday February 4: Mrs May is expected to announce the new chair and her possible plans for a new format of the inquiry, which could potentially involve scrapping the existing panel and replacing it with a more powerful body.
