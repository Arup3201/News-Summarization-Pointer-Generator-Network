When it comes to living a life of solitude, it doesn't get much more self-sufficient than this.

A 4,200-square-foot compound in Yellow Jacket, a desert town in Montezuma County, Colorado, has been built with disaster-ready architecture, essentially allowing it to withstand anything the world can throw at it.

The walls are made of reinforced concrete and lined with steel.

The structure is so strong it has been deemed 'nuclear rated', according to Curbed.

Just your average house ... with a 100-foot radio tower: This Colorado bunker, which has been deemed disaster-proof, is on the market for $11.5 million

The compound, in Yellow Jacket, Colorado, is on the market for $11.5 million or can be rented for $19,500 a month per person

Cosy: The interior has a homely feel, save for the metal air ducts on the roof, which are designed to close in the event of any air contamination, such as a nuclear meltdown

The bunker has four different power sources and has never experienced a drop in the 10 years since it was built

The house is far from any other properties, allowing for uninterrupted privacy

The bunker comes with a 100-foot radio tower and a helicopter pad.

Built into it is a seven-stage water filtration system and four separate power systems.

Among
 the latter is an array of solar and wind turbine set-ups, as well as 
propane and gas generators that are used as a last resort.

According to the sales listing, in the 10 years the house has been there, it has never experienced a power drop.

However it's surprisingly easy to forget the military-like features of the bunker because the interior is so friendly.

In the absence of a nuclear disaster, the well-manicured grounds seem a nice place to relax

We could think of worse ways to see out the end of the world ...

Dinner will be served in the dining room

The compound has no windows and relies on artificial light

Inside the only giveaways to the house's power are the metal air ducts that can be seen overhead.

These are designed to close off in the case of extremities, such as contaminated air from a biological hit, gas leak, etc.

The home can also be rented for 19.5K a month - but that is per head.

So in the case of any future, pre-planned natural or nuclear disasters, you and your kin can book in and be totally safe.

The compound, believed to have been built in 2003, is on the market for the first time with an asking price of $11.5 million

The interior features were fashioned to suit the Montezuma County area

The house is located in Yellow Jacket, Colorado. It is not know what motivated the owner to build it
