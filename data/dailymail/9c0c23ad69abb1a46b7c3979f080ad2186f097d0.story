Manchester City fans might have thought that the trip to Barcelona couldn’t get much worse after watching their side lose 4-1 on aggregate to the Spanish champions at the Nou Camp. Manchester City fans were wrong.

Hundreds of Blues supporters were forced to fly to Newcastle instead of Manchester in the early hours of Thursday morning because of a blanket of thick fog over the runway at the city’s airport. 

Two Jet2 planes from Barcelona were diverted to the North East from Barcelona following City’s 2-1 defeat.

Oh dear: Manchester Evening News reporter Mike Keegan was on the flight and posted this picture

No way: So bad was the visibility that the planes (not pictured) were forced to fly further north

Agonisingly for the Blues fans on board, who had already endured watching another Champions League disappointment in Catalonia, the plane was preparing to land at Manchester before picking up speed and heading further north. 

Manchester Evening News reporter Mike Keegan was on one of the services, and told the paper: ‘The wheels were down and it looked like we were moments away from landing when it picked up speed and lifted.’

The flight circled above Bolton for half-an-hour before heading to Newcastle airport to finally land. The planes were due to touch down in Manchester at around 2am, but coaches arrived in Newcastle to take the passengers home at 5am.

Stand-out performer: But Vincent Kompany couldn't prevent his City side losing at the Nou Camp

Too strong: Barcelona beat City 4-1 on aggregate in the round of 16 tie

City had another bad night in Europe as first-leg goalscorers Lionel Messi and Dani Alves bagged a goal apiece to seal their demise. Pablo Zabaleta was also sent off for dissent when the Blues were denied a penalty by French referee Stephane Lannoy in the second half. 

Another fan, Ian Martin, 61, was on the other flight and quipped:  ‘We had two goes at landing. We thought the ref might have had a word with the pilot!’

Keegan, who was on the coach with the supporters, tweeted at around 8.15am: ‘Almost there!’

At least the City fans won’t forget this Champions League trip in a hurry.
