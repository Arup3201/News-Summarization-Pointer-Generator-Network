Swansea defender Chico Flores is set to be reunited with Michael Laudrup at Qatari club Lekwiya.

Flores has been a key man for the Welsh club over the past couple of seasons but he now looks set to link up with Laudrup, who left the Liberty Stadium last season, once more after travelling to Qatar on Tuesday.

The  Spaniard is understood to have already said goodbye to his team-mates ahead of his move to the Middle East.

Sportsmail revealed Laudrup's interest last month and the 27-year-old is ready to sign a lucrative contract with a £3.6million fee agreed between the clubs.

Flores' performances for the Swans pushed him to the fringes of the Spain squad, but his move to Lekwiya is unlikely to help his international chances.

He joined Swansea from Genoa in 2012 for a £2million fee. Meanwhile, Swansea remain keen on Celtic's Adam Matthews. 

Jose Canas is also set to leave the Liberty Stadium as Swansea's Spanish exodus continues.

A source close to the player confirmed he has been told he can leave, with several clubs, including Elche, interested.

His wages have proved a sticking point with Spanish clubs unable to match what he is earning in Wales.

Fighter: Flores almost earned a Spain call-up last season but a move to Qatar won't likely further that
