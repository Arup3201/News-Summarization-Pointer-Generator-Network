He is famed for his I Have a Dream speech given 50 years ago, but the estate of Martin Luther King Jr is having a nightmare as the civil rights leader's children argue over his memorabilia.

The estate, run by his two sons, has sued a non-profit organization run by King's daughter, Bernice, claiming she planned to keep using her father's 'irreplaceable' memorabilia despite no longer being licensed to do so.

The lawsuit claims speeches, recordings and even the remains of King, who was assassinated in 1968, are at risk of being damaged by fire, mold and theft.

King's niece, Alveda, is also accused of trying to hamper an audit of his possessions carried out by the estate.

A lawsuit, filed in Fulton County Court last month by Martin Luther King III and Dexter King, claims the estate licensed intellectual property rights to The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in March 2009.

The center's chief executive is the youngest child of King, and his estate has been its largest donor in the past decade, according to Courthouse News Service.

Dr. King's estate claims it supports the center's mission to maintain King's legacy and has been the nonprofit's single largest individual donor for the past decade.

But, in the lawsuit it claims the center has been careless with King's intellectual property, which includes his 'name, image, recorded voice and memorabilia,' along with 'all works of authorship ... including writings, speeches, sermons, letters and copyrights,' trademark interests, and 'the remains and coffin contained within the crypt of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr'.

After an audit in April, the estate claimed 'the current manner of care and storage of the physical property by defendant is unacceptable'.

It alleged items were at risk from fire and water damage, mold, mildew and theft.

King's sons claim they have tried to work with their sister, but the relationship 'has recently become strained'.

Since then, the estate allegedly had to end the worldwide royalty-free licensing agreement by serving the King Center a 30-day notice.

The decision can be overturned, but only if the center puts Bernice King on administrative leave until the audit is complete.

The center would also need approval for the use and treatment of memorabilia from the estate and would have to remove Alveda King from its board.

An attorney for Bernice King said in a letter that the center 'is taking action to work a violation of plaintiff's intellectual property rights,' according to the estate.

It wants a court order forcing the King Center to stop using its intellectual property after the license expires in September.
