Jeweler Tiffany & Co won praise from across the globe last week for casting a same sex couple in its latest campaign.

Now the stars of that captivating photo have spoken about the 'overwhelming' response to the ad and how they are adjusting to their newfound fame.

New York City-based fashion executive Thomas Trube Bourne, 44, who married model, dancer and SoulCycle instructor Eric Trube Bourne, 29,  in May last year, says they never anticipated such a huge response when they shot the ad.

'I was a bit overwhelmed seeing our faces on every TV channel,' he told Daily Mail Online.

'We never expected this. It was just a fun thing we did. Now having details about ourselves and our relationship in the public is very exposing and freeing at the same time.'

In fact, even the timing was something of a surprise, he added: 'The ad was leaked early so the actual campaign has not been released yet.'

Eric reveals that he and his husband landed a meeting with Tiffany & Co's casting director through his agent.

'They asked us about our relationship, how we got engaged and we got the job,' he told Mlive.com.  

The ad sees the couple posing on the steps of a brownstone in Manhattan's West Village - a setting not unlike Carrie Bradshaw's famous stoop.

The black-and-white photo, taken by legendary fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh, shows the two men smiling, arms interlinked. It is positioned beside a photo of two men's wedding rings and the words: 'Will you?' 

The small print alongside the image reads: 'Will you promise to never stop completing my sentences or singing off-key, which I'm afraid you do often? And will you let today be the first sentence of one long story that never, ever ends?'

The other six ads in the series play on the 'Will You?' theme, though the focus is on women's diamond wedding and engagement rings.  

Eric says that as far as he is aware, he and Thomas were the only real couple to appear in the series of ads, the others feature top models posing as couples - Andreea Diaconu, Joséphine Le Tutour, Luca Gadjus and Cora Emmanuel among them.

And his relationship's authenticity is an aspect of the ad that he is most proud of.

'I think that's what makes this so special,' he said. 'The campaign is all about the nontraditional marriage and how love and marriage follows its own journey. To be part of that is really exciting.'     

Tiffany & Co spokeswoman Linda Buckley told CNN that the two men were chosen for the campaign because they are a real-life couple.  

'Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear,' she told the network. 'True love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms.'

For Eric and Thomas, their relationship developed in a relatively straightforward way. They met at a Christmas party in December 2011, dated and moved in together.

The wedding, in May 2014, was a whim, according to Mlive.com: 'One morning, they woke up and decided to go to City Hall and marry each other.'

The campaign was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback. But Tiffany & Co, known for its blue boxes, is far from the first to take such a step. In some regards they are a few years late.

J. Crew broke the mold in 2011 when it featured one of their designers and his partner in a catalog.

Gap erected a billboard emblazoned with a same-sex couple the following year.

Banana Republic did the same thing in 2014, and in February last year, Barney's New York used 17 transgender men and women for its ad campaign.
