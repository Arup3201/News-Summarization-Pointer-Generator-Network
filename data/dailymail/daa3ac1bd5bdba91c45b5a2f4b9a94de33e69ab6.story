A village has unveiled a new bus shelter - despite having NO bus services there for the past six years.

The smart new concrete structure was specially built for the people of Bissoe, Cornwall for free by a generous local construction firm.

However anyone who uses it faces a long wait as the last bus stopped in the village in 2008. Grateful residents hope the new shelter will be a sign that their old service could one day be restored.

Simon Lucas, the production manager at Cornish Concrete Products, said that his company was just doing its bit for the local community.

He said: ‘The old bus shelter was falling down and we thought it was starting to become a bit of a hazard.

‘We approached the council and asked if we could provide a new one for nothing.

‘They agreed but said it would have to be similar to the old one, so we made one the same size but carved the word Bissoe into the front of it.

‘There’s no real focal point to the village when people come here, so we thought this would mark it out.

‘We are aware there are no buses coming here at the moment but we’d like to hope that the new shelter might encourage them to come back.

‘It would certainly help us if they did, as it would help our employees to get to work more easily if there was a bus service.’

Villagers launched a Facebook campaign last year begging bus companies to divert the region’s services so they stop in Bissoe - but their pleas have so far gone unanswered.

Local resident Nicholas Richards said: ‘It’s nice that Cornish Concrete Products have done it out of goodwill and it’s nice the way that they have done it.

‘But it seems quite ironic that we have this new shelter but no bus services.’
