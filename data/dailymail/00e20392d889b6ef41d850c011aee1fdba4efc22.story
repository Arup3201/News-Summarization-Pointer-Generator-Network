Newcastle took a different approach to warm weather training as they gear up for the new season.

Pardew's squad were pictured dipping their toes in the cold North Tyneside sea much to the amusement of some of the players.

New signings Siem de Jong, Jack Colback and Ayoze Perez were all involved in the activity as the players mingled amongst the locals by the beach.

The St. James' Park outfit kick-started their ball-playing pre-season training on Monday after the players had underwent thorough physical testing on Friday and Saturday.

Their first taste of football ahead of the new season is a pre-season friendly at Oldham Athletic on July 15 before embarking on a short tour down under to face Sydney FC and Wellington Phoenix.

Pardew's squad first taste of competitive action is against Manchester City when they host the Premier League champions on the opening day of the season on August 16.
