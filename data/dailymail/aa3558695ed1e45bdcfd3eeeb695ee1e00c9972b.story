Doomsday is just around the corner, or so believe 10 per cent of people in the US - with almost one in four thinking the world will end in their lifetime.

Worldwide, 10 per cent believe the Mayan calendar on December 21Â  signifys the apocalypse will happen in 2012, according to a new poll.

Ipsos Global Public Affairs carried out the poll on behalf of news agency Reuters.

Doomsday prediction: Mayan calender predicts end of the world on December 21 this year and almost ten per cent of the US agree

Keren Gottfried, research manager at Ipsos said: 'Whether they think it will come to an end through the hands of God, or a natural disaster or a political event, whatever the reason, one in seven thinks the end of the world is coming.

'Perhaps it is because of the media attention coming from one interpretation of the Mayan prophecy that states the world ends in our calendar year 2012.'

Some 16,262 people in more than 20 countries were questioned and the responses varied greatly from county to country.

The French, typically, are most relaxed about it all, with only six per cent believing in Armageddon in their lifetime in contrast to 22 per cent in the US and Turkey.

In the UK, eight percent feared apocalypse during their lives.

Globally, around 10 people fear there will be no 2013, with the highest percentage in Russia and Poland and the fewest in Great Britain.

People with lower education or income, as well as those under 35, were more likely to believe in an apocalypse during their lifetime or in 2012.

'Perhaps those who are older have lived long enough to not be as concerned with what happens to their future, said Gottfried.

Citizens in China, Turkey, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, the United States, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, France, Spain, Belgium, Canada, Australia, Italy, South Africa, Great Britain, Indonesia and Germany were polled.
