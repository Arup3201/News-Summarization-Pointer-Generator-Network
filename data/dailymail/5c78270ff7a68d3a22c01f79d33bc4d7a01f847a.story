Jeh Johnson announced heightened security measures at some federal buildings

Security will be increased at various federal government buildings in Washington and other major American cities, the Homeland Security Department announced Tuesday evening in what it described as a 'precautionary step.' 

The move came one week after a gunman in Ottawa fatally shot a soldier as he stood as a ceremonial guard at Ottawa's National War Memorial, then stormed the Parliament building. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the shooting a terrorist attack.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson would not identify the buildings where there will be an increased security presence or disclose the specific security measures to be taken by the Federal Protective Service, which protects more than 9,500 federal facilities visited daily by roughly 1.4 million people. 

But he said 'prudence dictates a heightened vigilance' to protect government buildings and workers.

The specific security steps will vary from location to location and 'will be continually re-evaluated,' he said.

'The reasons for this action are self-evident: the continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere, including against law enforcement and other government officials, and the acts of violence targeted at government personnel and installations in Canada and elsewhere recently,' Johnson said in a statement.

He also called on law enforcement nationwide to be on the lookout for small-scale attacks, like the one in Canada, 'by a lone offender or a small group of individuals.'

Canadian authorities have said the accused gunman in last week's attack, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was driven by ideological and political motives and made a video before the shooting talking about Canada's foreign policy and his religious beliefs.

Secretary Jeh Johnson announced the move Tuesday, one week after a gunman in Ottawa shot a soldier ( and stormed Canada's seat of government. 

A Homeland Security official told CNN there is 'no new intelligence' suggesting that U.S. government buildings face additional threats, and emphasized that the changes are a 'precautionary measure' that only apply to buildings secured by the Federal Protective Service.

Today U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry said that the attack on the Canadian parliament
and the country's National War Memorial last week was clearly a terrorist act.

'Clearly, anybody who walks up in a premeditated way with a
loaded rifle and attacks someone in uniform then purposely goes
to a parliament, is committing, by common sense standards, a
terrorist act,' Kerry told a news briefing after talks in Ottawa
with his Canadian counterpart, Foreign Minister John Baird.

Two days before the attack in Ottawa on Oct. 22, a car
driven by a man described by police as a homegrown radical ran
down two soldiers, killing one in Quebec.

The attack has had ramifications across the world - in London armed soldiers have been deployed
at a top tourist attraction in the heart of the city's government
district as a precautionary measure after an Islamist gunman
attacked the Canadian parliament last week, a military source
said on Tuesday.

The source told Reuters that the decision to deploy the
troops at the entrance to Horse Guards Parade in London's
Whitehall was not motivated by a specific threat but was
designed to be a visible deterrent.
