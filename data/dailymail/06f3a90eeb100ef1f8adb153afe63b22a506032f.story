The Scots will effectively lose the right to play the National Lottery if they vote for independence, it has emerged.

Laws drawn up when the National Lottery was launched 20 years ago say that any decision by the Scots to opt out of the UK would also result in them opting out of the right to play the games.

The right to take part in the Lotto and the EuroMillions is restricted to those who buy a ticket in the UK or have a UK bank account. The same rules make clear the Scots would also have to give up their right to receive billions of pounds in grants to charities, sports, the arts, historic buildings and other causes.

That would be a hammer blow to Scotland, given that more than 50,000 organisations have received lottery grants totalling £2.5billion. The SNP and the Scottish Government have told organisations north of the border that there will be no change to funds received from the Lottery as a result of a Yes vote.

However, a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said last night: ‘A new Scottish state would have no automatic right to continue being part of the UK National Lottery.’

Up to 70 per cent of Scots regularly play Lotto and EuroMillions. The biggest donors to the independence campaign and the Scottish National Party in recent years have been the Scottish lottery winners, Chris and Colin Weir, who have handed over £5.5million. The couple, who are from Largs in Ayrshire, won £161million in the EuroMillions in 2011 and they have since enjoyed the hospitality of SNP leader Alex Salmond at his official residence, Bute House.

A spokesman for Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘The current Camelot contract runs to 2023. Given that Scotland already contributes to the lottery, there is absolutely no reason why it should not continue to operate as it does just now.’
