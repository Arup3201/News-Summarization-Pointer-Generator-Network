A collective sigh of relief was heard throughout the world last night as Rosetta woke from its two-and-half-year slumber.

The probe creaked into action 500 million miles from Earth at 10am yesterday, taking an agonising eight hours to let Earth know that it was ok.  

‘That last quarter of an hour was one of the toughest of my life,’ mission director, Paolo Ferri told MailOnline. ‘I never want to do it again.’

Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov/Gerasimenko. it is due to arrive at the comet in August this year

Rosetta,
 named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient
 Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the 
composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and 
evolution of our solar system. 

The
 probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five 
times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its 
final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

For
 the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out 
towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space 
hibernation.

Later
 this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting 
with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s 
surface in November.

ESA received the all-clear signal at 6.18pm, some 48 minutes behind schedule. A few seconds later, Rosetta sent the message ‘Hello World!’ out on Facebook and Twitter.

‘Having Rosetta go into hibernation was a nightmare for me,’ Dr Ferri said.

‘It’s the worst thing you can tell a mission controller that you’re not going to be in touch with your spacecraft for a while,’ said Dr Ferri.

‘But I tell you, my life has changed so much since yesterday…and I’m so happy.’

While the celebratory ribbons are being 
cleared away, mission control is hard at work to uncover any problems 
Rosetta may now be facing.

The spacecraft, which was launched in 
2004, is due to rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and land
 a probe on it this year in an unprecedented manoeuvre.

‘What we got yesterday was simple a radio frequency carrier from Rosetta saying “I’m alive!”’, said Dr Ferri

‘We still need to get all the telemetry, which it’s sending down now, and we’ll be analysing that overnight.’

The European Space Agency (ESA) received the all-clear message 'Hello World!' from its Rosetta spacecraft, 500 million miles away, shortly after 6pm

The signal was received by Nasa's Goldstone ground station in California at 18:18 GMT, during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with Earth. It was immediately confirmed in ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt (pictured)

The
 Rosetta mission will perform several historical firsts, including the 
first time a spacecraft orbits a comet rather than just whizzing by it 
to snap some fly-by pictures, and the first time a probe has landed on a
 comet's nucleus.

Rosetta
 is also the first mission to venture beyond the main asteroid belt 
relying solely on solar cells for power generation, which is also why it
 had to be put into a deep sleep for 957 days.

'It
 has been so far away from the sun that the solar rays were not able to 
generate enough energy to safely operate the spacecraft, said Rosetta 
spacecraft operations manager Andrea, who has been working on the 
Rosetta mission since 1997.

The data so far suggests that all the systems are healthy and working perfectly.

'In the worst case scenario, the instruments are exactly as they were when we entered hibernation 2.5 years ago,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘In the best cast, they are better as they’ve managed to get some rest.’

Mission control have now switched on the space probe’s mass memory, and in the coming days will reactivate the crafts four momentum wheels.

These wheels are essentially fast rotating discs that spin at a few thousand revolutions per minute - similar to a gyroscope. They are used to keep the 3-dimensional attitude of the satellite fixed direction.

By Monday, Rosetta is expected to be fully functional and will remain stable as it falls closer to the sun and its target comet.

The craft is currently around 5.6 million miles from its destination and closing on the object at more than half a mile a second.

Rosetta
 is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination, the comet 
Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and closing on the object at half a mile a 
second.

The spacecraft, 
which was launched by in French Guiana in 2004, will now spend several 
months approaching and orbiting the comet.

Once it has found for a suitable  site, it will attempt a landing in November.

Scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples from the comet's body.

It now has 644W of power from the sun, but scientists want it to gain several hundred watts more before they can switch on its scientific instruments.

They believe this will happen in early March as Rosetta heads towards closer the sun.

‘What counts for us now is the relative speed between the spacecraft and the comet,’ said Dr Ferri.

‘It’s now travelling around 1km per second faster than the comet. In May, we will need to correct that and slow it down to 0.5m per second – less than walking speed.’

By the time Rosetta reaches the comet in August, it will be travelling at only a few tens of centimetres per second.

‘What comes after that will be completely new,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘I wouldn’t describe it as a fear. But it’s a big challenge and hugely exciting to learn how to fly around a comet and then try and land a probe on its surface’.

The manoeuvre is described by Dr Ferri as a ‘gentle push’ with Rosetta releasing the probe between 5-10 km away from the comet.

Scientists have no idea whether the comet’s surface will be as soft as snow or hard as ice.

And unlike the Moon or a planet, the comet is too small, at 2.5 miles across, to have a significant gravity. So the lander will fire a harpoon into the surface to keep it anchored.

Lead scientist Jean Pierre Bibring said: ‘The risks are huge. We had to develop something to land on something that was unpredictable and unknown.’

Both Rosetta and the lander will be able to take images of the comet, as well as use their many onboard instruments to analyse samples.

Scientists hope the probe’s findings will help them understand the composition of comets and thereby discover more about the origins and evolution of our solar system.

They have speculated that comets - which are essentially giant, dirty snowballs - may be responsible for the water found on some planets.

And like asteroids, comets also pose a theoretical threat to life on Earth.

‘I’m just extremely happy, and relieved, that Rosetta has woken up,’ said Dr Ferri. ‘What comes next will be incredibly exciting.’

The spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Pictured is an artist's impression of the comet
