Sir Cliff Richard: Considering legal action

Top executives at the BBC worked frantically with police behind the scenes to spin their disastrous coverage of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home, it emerged last night.

The Corporation was plunged into a huge row over its cosy deal with police after it was allowed privileged access to a search of the singer’s £3million Berkshire home.

It can now be revealed that even as questions were asked over their apparent ‘collusion’, senior figures at the BBC were engaging in behind-the-scenes discussions with police over what should be said publicly about what had happened.

Messages between the BBC and South Yorkshire Police lay bare how – once the row had broken – the BBC bargained with police over what they would say about it.

The day after raid, the BBC’s head of newsgathering, Jonathan Munro, offered to tweet a statement exonerating the force from claims it had been the source of its story ‘as a gesture of goodwill’, boasting that the message would ‘reach every newsroom in the UK pretty much instantly.’

In turn, emails show South Yorkshire Police’s head of corporate communications, Carrie Goodwin, sending a public statement to the BBC for approval before it was published. Miss Goodwin wrote: ‘We haven’t mentioned the BBC or any suggestion of any wrongdoing. Is this OK for you?’

Emails also show how staff at both organisations stressed that they were ‘keen’ to maintain their relationship, and wanted to let the ‘dust settle’ as the controversy over their treatment of the pop icon raged.

Copies of texts, emails and notes passed to a Parliamentary committee show how the BBC was given the inside track before, during and after the raid.

The new evidence emerged as it was claimed Sir Cliff, 74, is preparing to sue the broadcaster over its live TV coverage of the search of his home.

The singer is expected to seek damages for breach of privacy if, as he expects, he does not face charges over an allegation of historical sex abuse.

He is also said to be considering legal action against the force after it tipped off the broadcaster about the timing and location of the raid.

The police investigation began when a man claimed Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him during a Christian rally in Sheffield organised by Billy Graham, the American evangelist, in 1985.

Police struck a deal with the BBC giving it privileged access after it learned, a month before the August raid, that reporter Dan Johnson knew Sir Cliff was under investigation. The BBC faced a wave of criticism from the public, stars and MPs over its handling of the sensitive police operation. 

It posted reporters at the gates before police arrived and dispatched a helicopter to hover overhead, allowing officers to be filmed through the windows.

Sir Cliff, who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested, was in Portugal and learned of the raid via the TV coverage. Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, described the police inquiry as a ‘witch-hunt’ and attacked the BBC for an ‘error of judgment’.

Sir Cliff’s lawyer, Gideon Benaim, who denounced the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting, was not available to comment yesterday. Neither was Sir Cliff’s spokesman.

A report by the Commons home affairs select committee found the BBC acted ‘perfectly properly’ in its dealings with police, but said the coverage caused Sir Cliff ‘enormous, irreparable damage’.

South Yorkshire Police said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well-intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety caused to Sir Cliff Richard.'

July 17 Police press chief Carrie Goodwin notes a deal struck with reporter Dan Johnson after he reveals he knows that police are investigating Sir Cliff. She writes in her notes: ‘Consider... notify of search date + location to prevent broadcast.’

August 13 The day before the raid, a member of the police press team emails Johnson an aerial photo of Sir Cliff’s home.

August 14 The day of the raid. Johnson is given a running commentary of police progress. At 5.12pm Miss Goodwin texts Johnson, asking: ‘Good day?’ He replies: ‘Bonkers, but brilliant…’

But things turn sour when the story appears on the BBC website, suggesting police tipped off the broadcaster to maximise coverage.

Miss Goodwin then texts Johnson at 7.22pm: ‘Not happy about this at all. This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’

August 15 In an email, Jonathan Munro, BBC head of newsgathering, offers to post a tweet saying that the force ‘was not the original source’ as a ‘gesture of good faith’.

Miss Goodwin replies an hour later, asking for his approval for a police statement explaining why the police acted the way they did. In the 3.11pm email, Miss Goodwin says: ‘We haven’t mentioned the BBC or any suggestion of any wrongdoing. Is this OK for you?’

August 17 Chief Constable David Crompton formally complains to the BBC, saying police worked with the corporation to ‘protect the integrity of the investigation’.

August 18 Chief Constable Crompton phones BBC company secretary Phil Harrold. Miss Goodwin notes: ‘[He] acknowledged … like to let the dust settle. Keen to continue to work with the BBC.’

She also wrote that Munro wanted to avoid a ‘war of press releases’.
