League One side Leyton Orient have pulled off a major coup by agreeing a deal to sign former Liverpool and Sunderland left back Andrea Dossena until the end of the season.

Dossena, 33, was a free agent after being released by Gus Poyet's side at the end of last season.

The experienced defender made 11 appearances in all competitions for the Mackems last term, but was part of a mass player clear-out conducted by Poyet in the summer.

The Italian's first spell in England was with Liverpool, spending 18 months with the Reds following a £7million move from Udinese in 2008.

Despite having a bit-part role at the club, he remains fondly remembered by the Kop faithful for his goals against both Manchester United and Real Madrid.

After leaving the Reds Dossena then spent time at Serie A trio Napoli, Palermo and Torino, before making the move to Wearside last September.

Dossena has now linked up with the O's on a short-term deal, and his signing will provide a huge boost to the club, as they find themselves struggling towards the bottom of League One after a disappointing start to the season.
