A Queensland grandmother, banned from any contact with children after being charged with the attempted murder of her two step-grandchildren, has moved into an apartment across the road from two schools after being released on bail this week. 

The woman, 58, allegedly tried to kill the two boys, aged nine and 11, by setting fire to their bedroom with an accelerant and 'intentionally impeding' their escape route.

She has been been charged with four counts of attempted murder of children, attempted arson and interfering with a corpse in a Morayfield home, north of Brisbane, between April 2013 and September 2014.  

The Courier-Mail has now revealed the grandmother has moved within metres of Ipswich West Primary School and a special school, after her release from Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre on bail this week.

'The last photo of me and my grandson': The grandmother of the youngest child who died in Queensland's 'house of horrors' claimed he was murdered

The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, when the grandmother was present

In January, the Queensland Magistrates court granted the woman bail on the condition she find somewhere to live where she would have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. 

According to the the Courier Mail, angry parents outside the Queensland schools yesterday were demanding to know why they hadn't been informed and for the grandmother to be moved.

The woman's laywer, Michael Bosscher, said one of the conditions of his client’s bail was that she had no direct contact with children but said the court didn't consider the move a risk. 

'The court, when hearing her bail application, was aware of the proximity of the primary school and, given the nature of the charges, doesn’t consider her to be any particular risk to children,'  Mr Bosscher said.  

Horror scene: Queensland police recreated the moment the children, aged nine and 11, were nearly murdered in their beds by a deliberately lit fire

Firefighters remove the bed from the makeshift home. Police believe the children were deliberately blocked from exiting their bedroom 

Detectives allege the grandmother tried to kill her two step grandsons, aged 9 and 11, by using an accelerant to set fire to a bed and holding their bedroom door closed. 

The children survived the fire with burns to their lower limbs, but a forensic recreation of the arson attack led detectives to believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape route from the bedroom.

Police say the woman had twice before tried to suffocate the 11-year-old with a pillow and a tea towel as he slept.  

'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mind-boggling,' said Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen of the crimes. 

Police have also accused the grandmother of killing a three-year-old boy in 2013, and a seven-month old baby, her grandson, in the same 'house of horrors' in 2014.

At the time, the younger children's deaths were explain as SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] but police say the grandmother, who was present at the Morayfield home when both children died, had moved the baby from her own bedroom to make it look like he had died in a cot. 

The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother, pleaded in 2013 for anyone with information to come forward and help police. 

'(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said at the time. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. 

'How did my little buddy die?’ 

Asked previously by Seven News  if she had killed her grandchildren, the woman replied: 'Absolutely not. I’m not a heartless person. Someone with no heart would do that.

Father and son: The father of the three-year-old boy police believe was murdered by his step grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler

The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son.

All four boys are  children of the same mother, but her most recent partner was father to the seven-month-old boy who died in September 2014. 

The two boys who survived the fire remain in the care of their mother and stepfather under supervision. Police say the pair are not suspected of being involved.

But the father of the boys, who sees them sporadically, said he 'feared for their lives' every day they are in the house. 

'Just mindboggling': Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific

The incidents, described by police as 'mind-boggling' each occurred on the 27th day of different months. 

Investigations into the younger children's deaths are ongoing and police are seeking legal advice on an appeal of the  Court's decision of bail for the grandmother involved.
