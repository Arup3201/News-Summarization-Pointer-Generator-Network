Water companies unveiled an 11-point diktat last night to stop 20million people from beating a hosepipe ban.

As the drought-hit South and East of the country faced drastic restrictions on consumption, bosses issued an extensive checklist to prevent households from exploiting loopholes.

It includes a ban on using a hose or sprinkler to water plants, wash a car or boat, fill fountains, swimming or paddling pools, or to clean patios, driveways or windows.

Even spraying your children to keep 
them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed, and those caught breaking 
the rules face a £1,000 fine.

Seven water companies announced that 
they would enforce Temporary Use Bans – affecting one in three UK homes –
from April 5 after the plans were revealed in the Daily Mail yesterday.

The strict rules are an attempt to 
close any loopholes after the last hosepipe ban in 2006 led to 
widespread accusations of cheating, with thousands reported to water 
companies by their neighbours or served with 'yellow card' letters 
warning them to obey the law.

Yesterday water companies stressed 
that they hoped the ban would be enforced through goodwill and educating
people about the need to save water.

The restrictions were brought in 
following two years of chronically low rainfall which has left rivers 
dry and reservoirs down to record low levels.

Customers of Anglian Water, Southern, 
Southeast, Thames, Veolia Southeast and Veolia  Central – which cover 
parts of London and the Home Counties – and Sutton and East Surrey Water
will be affected.

Water companies said that without persistent above-average 
rainfall for several weeks, the unpopular measures could last until the 
end of the summer in the 14 counties which are already officially in 
drought.

Otherwise they face 'severe drought' 
by the summer, the Environment Agency warned yesterday, which could 
result in extending restrictions to businesses.

Hosepipe bans may also be enforced in 
East Yorkshire and Wiltshire which are at 'high risk' of drought 
conditions this summer, the agency's Drought Prospects report said.

Its chairman Lord Smith urged 
businesses to cut down on use, as electricity companies which use water 
for cooling and water-intensive industries such as concrete 
manufacturing could be affected.

Predictions of continuing dry weather 
have raised fears that restrictions could be extended to car washes, 
road cleaning and public pools.

The Met Office's long-range forecast, 
which is given to Government and businesses, revealed that the chances 
of heavy rain are as low as 10 per cent between March and May, compared 
with a long-term average of 20 per cent.

The average person uses 150 litres of 
water a day. Water company infrastructure across England and Wales 
leaked 3.4billion litres a day in 2010/11 – a third of the UK's usage – 
according to the regulator Ofwat.

The latest figures revealed that 
groundwater levels across the affected region are even lower than during
the 1976 drought when taps were switched off in some cities, and 
residents had to use standpipes in the street.

Drought conditions are already 
affecting fruit and cereal crops, as well as destroying wildlife 
habitats and causing fish to die in low rivers.

Justin Taberham of the Chartered 
Institution of Water and Environmental Management said that if consumers
do not start curbing their water use at home, the economy will be 
affected.

'If water levels in drought-stricken 
areas don't improve, hosepipe bans could be just the beginning and 
industry will start to be affected,' he said.

'The first companies to face bans will
be those who waste water unnecessarily and aren't seen as particularly 
important, like car wash firms.

'If things continue to get worse, 
that's when agriculture will be affected and public parks will struggle 
with maintaining their gardens.

'As industries pay per volume of water
used, they are not as wasteful of water as homeowners who may leave the
tap running or not use watering cans. Simply put, if people want to 
stop facing these bans, they need to think more about what they are 
doing.'

This is one of the largest hosepipe 
bans ever implemented. The last in the South was in 2006 affecting 
12million people, and 7million in the North East were hit in 2010. 
Ciaran Nelson of Anglian Water said: 'Although it is a hosepipe ban, it 
is really symbolic of urging people to do everything they can to save 
water at home.

'We don't have sprinkler patrols and 
helicopters in the air watching people, but we are confident they will 
do the right thing at a very difficult time because of the exceptionally
dry two years we have had.'

Martin Baggs, chief executive of 
Thames Water, said water levels in the underground aquifers were some of
the lowest ever recorded.

He said: 'We know these restrictions 
will be unpopular, but they will save a lot of water. A garden sprinkler
uses as much water in an hour as a family of four uses in a day.'
