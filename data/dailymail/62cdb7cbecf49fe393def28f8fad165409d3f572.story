The British and Irish Lions have started their preparations for the daunting trip to New Zealand in 2017 early by naming ex-England captain John Spencer as tour manager.

Former Ireland winger Tom Grace was also appointed as chairman of the Lions board on Wednesday, succeeding Welshman Gerald Davies.

Spencer follows in the footsteps of Fran Cotton, for the successful 1997 South Africa tour, and Bill Beaumont, for the 3-0 series whitewash the last team the Lions visited New Zealand, as an English tour manager.

Glory: The Lions beat Australia 2-1 Down Under in 2013 to claim their first series victory since 1997

He has been promoted from his position as RFU representative on the Lions board, and he has also served on the IRB and Six Nations Council. 

The Yorkshireman, who won 14 caps for England between 1969 and 1971, as well as touring New Zealand with the Lions in 1971, said: 'It is a huge privilege and honour to represent the Lions as tour manager, 46 years after I did so as a player.

'My predecessor Andy Irvine did a fantastic job in Australia (2013), and I am looking forward to following in his footsteps.'

The Lions' 2-1 Test series triumph in Australia a year ago was their first since that victory over South Africa in 1997.

And their last trip to New Zealand nine years ago was not a pleasant experience for the tourists, with Sir Clive Woodward overseeing a 3-0 defeat to the All Blacks.

Grace, who toured South Africa with the 1974 Lions and won 25 Ireland caps for Ireland,said: 'It is an honour to be appointed chairman of the British and Irish Lions,' he said.

'The Lions represent the core values of our sport, and I am grateful for the opportunity to represent them as chairman.

'It is a privilege to take over from Gerald Davies, who has been a wonderful ambassador for the Lions as a player, tour manager and more recently as chairman.' 

Humiliation: Sir Clive Woodward oversaw the Lions' 3-0 whitewash last time they visited New Zealand in 2005
