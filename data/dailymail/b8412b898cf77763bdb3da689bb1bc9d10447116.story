The car ferry that caught fire in the Adriatic Sea killing ten people and injuring dozens more was found to have serious safety flaws during an inspection just 10 days ago.

The Norman Atlantic was examined by the international maritime authority Paris MoU earlier this month and found to have faulty fire doors, too few life rafts and poor emergency lighting.

The vessel, which was operated by Greek shipping company Anek Lines, was also criticized for its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency - raising serious questions over whether the tragedy could have been prevented.

The news comes as Italian officials launch an investigation to establish whether the fire started in one of the many lorries transporting olive oil from Greece to Italy, or if the highly flammable cargo simply added fuel the flames and made the deadly blaze even more intense.

Details of the Norman Atlantic's 'grave failings' in regard to fire safety were published on Greek and Italian websites this morning, citing a inspection by Paris MoU officials on December 19. 

Six 'deficiencies' are understood to have been identified relating to emergency lighting, fire doors and  'life saving appliances' that were deemed not to meet international safety standards. 

Officials are believed to have given Anek Lines 15 days to amend the problems but there is not yet any indication as to whether they had been addressed by the time the ferry left Patros in western Greece on its doomed voyage to Ancona in eastern Italy.

Trade unions have been quick to attack Greek shipping operator Anek Lines and Italian shipowner, Visemar Navigation Ltd, claiming corners were cut to increase profits.

A statement from four trade unions representing Greek shipping crews read: 'Once again, it is proven that shipowners' hunt for profit overrides the necessary measures for the protection of human life at sea.'

'As has been revealed behind the tragic shipwreck and fire there are serious failures in sea worthiness of vessels with painful consequences for passengers and ship workers,' it added.

'With the fire that broke out in the car decks of the Norman Atlantic the lives of 478 passengers was put at risk,' the four unions went on to say. 

Carlo Visentini, owner of Visemar, fought back however, saying his company had worked alongside the rescue operation and helped save the lives of several hundred people.

In the southern Italian city of Bari, where many of those rescued from the Norman Atlantic were taken for treatment, Judge Giuseppe Volpe this morning opened an investigation into how the disaster occured, raising the possibility that individuals could be charged with 'culpable shipwreck.'

The probe also aims to establish whether the fire could have started in one of the many lorries on board carrying a cargo of olive oil.

Such claims are bound to raise questions over whether the correct procedures were followed to prevent the highly flammable liquid coming in to contact with naked flames, and if there was sufficient equipment was on hand that could have prevented a small fire becoming a deadly blaze. 

Trade unions have also raised the suggestion that the vessel may have been overcrowded, and there remains much confusion over exactly how many people were on board the car ferry.

This afternoon the Italian authorities said the total death toll for the disaster had risen to ten, adding that they they are checking to see if anyone else might still be missing.

Italy's transport minister, Maurizio Lupi, said the total of 427 rescued included all 56 crew members. The original manifest listed 478 passengers and crew, with officials earlier saying they are unable to immediately explain why only 435 individuals had been accounted for.

Lupi said it was premature to speculate on whether people were still missing, but suggested that there might have been some people who reserved a spot on the ferry but did not board.

An official said that among the survivors, there were also people not listed on the manifest, indicating the possibility that some on board were traveling illegally.

Specialist Italian coast guard are continuing to search the interior of the ferry amid flames and heavy rain, and five Greek helicopters, a Greek frigate and another ship are still in the area.
