Big Brother isn't tracking only your phone calls and internet habits, the government also keep tabs on snail mail.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation teamed up with the US
Postal Service to track down ricin mailing suspect Shannon Guess Richardson using
a system that snaps pictures of ‘every
mail piece that is processed,’ according to a complaint.

Filed Friday in
Texas, the complaint details how federal investigators narrowed down the origin
of the letters by reviewing the pieces of mail scanned before and after the
ricin containing letters sent to President Barack Obama, New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg and a gun control lobby sponsored by the mayor.

Postmarked in
Shreveport, La, the letters were processed at a regional distribution facility
in the city, according to the complaint. Though in Louisiana, the plant also
processes mail for parts of Arkansas and Texas, where Richardson resides, the
complaint explains.

By referencing
two separate batches of mail processed by the postal service’s Automated Facer
Canceller System (ACFS) on May 20, as well as the Mail Isolation Control and
Tracking program, which takes the actual pictures of the mail, agents determined
the mail came from the area around New Boston, Texas, the complaint states.

The first of the three
letters, addressed to mayor Bloomberg, was opened four days later at a mail
center in Lower Manhattan. The second was opened two days later in Washington,
D.C., by a staffer at The Raben Group, the Bloomberg-sponsored gun control
lobbying firm. The third was intercepted on May 30 before reaching President
Obama, having been opened at the White House mail facility, the complaint detailed.

Richardson met in
Shreveport with investigators later that day, accused her husband of sending
the letters and turned over a book of stamps, which investigators determined on
June 3 to be the same book of stamps the ricin letters postage came from, said
the complaint posted on the Smoking Gun.

Further
investigation led to warrant-less searches of the couple’s New Boston home,
turning up castor beans – which contain the toxic ricin poison, saved letters
matching those mailed and other physical evidence, according to the report.

The nail in
Richardson’s accusatory coffin was that her husband was found to have been
working a 10-hour shift starting 6:30am, which was corroborated by coworkers,
the day the letters were postmarked, the complaint states.
