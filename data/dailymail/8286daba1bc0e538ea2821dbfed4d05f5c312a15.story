These pictures show the moment the organiser of a hairdressing awards apparently headbutted a guest after the event descended into chaos.

The images, taken at the INAA Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards at a luxury Thistle hotel in Glasgow, appear to show Ruthanne Reid strike the guest's face with her forehead - moments after another guest had exposed her rear.

But Mrs Reid, 57, strenuously denies the assault, which came after she also appeared march down a catwalk set up on the stage towards the 
audience and seemingly hit someone with her handbag.

Impact: This picture shows the moment a woman is apparently on the receiving end of a headbutt at an awards ceremony in Glasagow

Ruthanne Reid (in blue dress), 57, was caught on camera at a hairdressing awards ceremony apparently headbutting one guest

The woman reels backward as a group of women behind react with shock at the incident

She said: 'There was all this pushing and shoving and people were all around about me. I don't know.

'They said I head-butted somebody but I wouldn't.

'I was swaying, because I was being held from behind and I was pushed into her.

'It was never a head-butt. The woman is a good friend of my daughter, why on earth would I try and do that to her?'

The awards ceremony, which had billed itself as a 'showcase' for the beauty industry, and included guests such as actress Michelle Keegan and Miss Scotland Ellie McKeating, began to unravel when presenter Nimrod Kamer announced the wrong name for an award. 

Ruthanne Reid said: 'It was never a head-butt. The woman is a good friend of my daughter, why on earth would I try and do that to her?'

Peacemaker? The woman in red appears to be trying to calm down the event organiser

Mrs Reid said: 'We
 had Nimrod from Russia Today and he picked up the award cards from 
earlier that had been left on the podium rather than taking the card 
that came with the award.

'He called out the wrong name, and on the 
projector screen was the Esteem Beauty and instead he called out Cruz, 
who had already received their award earlier.'

Not willing to allow the award to be 
given unjustly, Ms Reid said she took to the stage to point out the 
mistake and make amends.

'I shouldn't have done it, I don't know why I did it but I just 
felt it was unfair as the right person hadn't been called out,' she said. 

Ms Reid said the unfortunate incident scuffle was down to a presenter calling out the wrong winner

Glammed up: 26-year-old Ms Campbell (pictured left and right) exposed her rear at Ms Reid during the event

'So I 
went on stage and said "I'm really really sorry, there's been a mistake,
 could Cruz go off as you have not won, the rightful winners are Esteem 
Beauty".

'There was a bit of booing, as the audience by that 
point were a bit rankled, to say the least, but the girl from Esteem 
came up and took the award so it was fine.'

However, female guest Kerry Campbell, 26, then ran up on stage, swore and exposed her rear.

Farce: Guests at the event said that Ms Reid had been drunk, and that the ceremony had descended into farce

Ms Reid said: 'I went on stage again to say that we hadn't completed the raffle
 but the mics went dead, and just at that moment a girl from Dundee came 
up on stage and put her fingers in my face.

'Then she did a moonie directed at me and I said "well that's very lady like", to which she ran back and tried to attack me.

'I
 tried to signal to the team to put the mics back on so I could complete
 the raffle, but people in the audience thought that I was going after 
the girl.

'They all came on stage and tried to hold me, they were all my friends, they misinterpreted the situation.'

Ms Reid said the crowd then became rowdy.

In the video clip Ms Reid is seen being restrained by a security guard.

She said: 'I started to resist as they were all
 pulling and shoving at me, and the next thing I know I'm being carried 
by security guards outside.

'To this moment I still haven't got any idea why that happened, and it must have looked so bad to everybody.'

She denied she had been drunk, and explained she was not wearing shoes because she had broken her toes.

'I was running about in my bare feet all night 
because I'd broken my toes while moving boxes at home, and I couldn't 
get my shoes on,' she said.

'When I went up and did my speech I actually 
apologised and said to everyone why I was barefoot, as the only shoes I 
could get into were tennis shoes.

Overshadowed: Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne, only for the evening to be overshadowed by allegations of assault

'I did have a drink that 
night. I'd had two half glasses of wine at most, that was all.

'I 
certainly wasn't drunk like they're making out. I didn't have the time 
to get drunk.

'The next day I felt as though I'd had a nervous 
breakdown. I have been on stress medication for some time and I feel 
that the night was just the final tip for it.'

Ms
 Reid today sent an apology to those who attended the event for her 
behaviour, which she put down to the wrong name being called out by 
presenters, and announced that she had resigned from the INAA.

'I am writing to express my sincerest apologies for my insensitive actions and behaviour on Sunday evening,' she wrote.

'Having
 spent four months on the planning and preparation it was highly 
embarrassing for the wrong name to be called out on stage.

'I
 can only imagine the distress caused to Cruz for which I apologise most
 profusely. I will of course accept that I have caused irreparable 
damage and have therefore resigned from INAA.'

Police were eventually called to the event, although no arrests were made.

More than 800
 guests had attended the £105-a-ticket event on Sunday evening, among 
them former Coronation Street actress Keegan and her fiance, ex-The Only
 Way Is Essex star Mark Wright, Miss McKeating and the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Sadie Docherty.

Another attendee, Ashley Hutton, 37, who 
owns a salon in Dundee, claimed Ms Reid appeared to be drunk and as the 
event neared its close had come on stage, taken hold of the microphone 
and yelled at the audience.

Mrs Hutton told Stv:
 'Ruthanne was very drunk and ended up screaming at everyone in the 
crowd for no reason. Before that even happened you would tell people 
were getting annoyed and agitated.

She added: 'Then all of a
 sudden she stormed off stage and started swinging her bag at people and
 then ended up headbutting a guest. Security got involved, it was just a
 farce.'

Venue: Around 800 guests attended the £105-a-ticket awards ceremony at the Thistle hotel

Exposed: While Ms Reid, who organised the event with daughter Joanne, was on stage, female guest Kerry Campbell was filmed swearing at her, before pulling up her dress (left) and exposing her bottom (right)

Chaos: Ms Reid, pictured on stage, claimed Ms Campbell 'did a moonie' before allegedly trying to attack her

Apology: Ms Reid sent this apology to attendees of the event, saying she had resigned from sponsors INAA

Guests: Former Coronation Street star Michell Keegan was in the audience for the prestigious awards ceremony

Mrs Hutton said 
Miss Scotland's crown had been knocked off in the fracas, and said she 
was embarrassed to have attended the event.

'People put a lot of time and effort into the awards and paid over £100 for a tickets, but it was just a disaster,' she said.

Gayle Leggatt, 30, who owns Cruz Hair and Beauty in Glasgow, winners of the hair salon of the year at the awards, said that when her salon was announced as the winner, Ms Reid stormed the stage.

'Just as I was about to speak, Ruthanne snatched the mic away,' she told the Daily Record.

'She started bawling about how it wasn’t the right salon that had won.'

Ms Reid, who lives in Paisley, said 
she had spent four months planning the event with her daughter Joanne and 
that she was left in tears as security guards dragged her from the 
venue.

She added: 'I was really looking forward to the night, like I do every year,
 and people had paid good money to go and enjoy themselves, but it just 
turned out ridiculous.

'When that awards started everything seemed to be going well, but during one of the sessions things started to go pear-shaped.'

A spokesman from Police Scotland told 
MailOnline: 'We were called at around 11.45pm on Sunday June 1 to a 
report of a disturbance but on arrival there was no evidence that any 
crime had been committed and no allegations of assault were made.'

A spokesman from the Thistle hotel group said the chain was unable to comment on the incident.
