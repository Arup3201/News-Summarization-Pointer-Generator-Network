He still would have worn red as he led an attacking line in England, but life could have been much different for Arsenal marksman Olivier Giroud had he chosen Teeside over the south of France. 

The Gunners striker revealed Arsenal's FA Cup fifth round opponents Middlesbrough were a genuine option for him as his next move from his first senior club Tours - he eventually decided on Montpellier as his last club before going to the Emirates. 

'Yes, that's true,' Giroud told Arsenal.com.

'Middlesbrough and Celtic (also wanted to sign me). It was a great team… today they are close to coming back into the English Premier League.'

Giroud spent January 2009 until May 2010 at Tours, before choosing Ligue 1's  Montpellier that summer. But the Riverside Stadium did play on his mind before making the decision. 

'It will be nice to play against them and it will remind me of my previous years in Tours,' he said.  

Had he gone to Boro, then in their second year back in the Championship following relegation under Gareth Southgate, he would have been working for Tony Mowbray and challenging Australian Scott McDonald to be the club's leading scorer. 

In retrospect, it's hard to argue with the call he made even with Boro now knocking on the door to return to the Premier League at the top of the Championship after 30 matches.

Giroud joined the Gunners on a £13million deal in the summer of 2012 as the Ligue 1's top scorer having found the net 21 times as he led Montpellier to the club's first top-flight title. 

The Frenchman was on the bench against Leicester on Tuesday but is expected to lead the line on Sunday as Arsenal take on Boro for a place in the sixth round. 

Boro earned their chance to reach the Cup's last eight against the knockout's defending champions by knocking over the Premier League title holders Manchester City 2-0 in round four.
