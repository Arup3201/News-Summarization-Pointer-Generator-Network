A mistake by an NYPD employee was to blame for the sensational DNA connection between the murder of Sarah Fox and the Occupy Wall Street movement, dashing hopes that after eight years her killer might finally be brought to justice.

It was originally thought that DNA found on a padlock chain dropped during an OWS protest this year matched that discovered at the 2004 murder scene of the aspiring Julliard actress.

However it is now believed that a worker at either the police crime lab or Medical Examiner's office, who handled evidence in both cases, botched the job.

False connection: Botched DNA evidence on a chain used in a protest by Occupy Wall Street activists this year had been linked to that found at the murder scene of a young actress in 2004

Sarah Fox, 21, was dragged from a running path in a Manhattan park in broad daylight on May 19, 2004 and strangled.

Several days later, her naked body was discovered in woodland with tulip petals arranged around it.

Although there was DNA found on her pink CD player nearby, Miss Fox's killer has never been found.

On March 28 this year, Occupy Wall Street protesters poured into the Beverly Road subway station in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.

They chained open emergency gates, taped up turnstiles and posted fliers, encouraging passengers to ride for free.

The chain was left behind when the activists fled the station following the demonstration. Police made no arrests following the incidents.

The subway stop protest was made up of mainly OWS supporters along with workers from the Transport Workers Union Local 100 and the Amalgated Transit Union.

NYPD investigators announced earlier this week that crime scene DNA from Miss Fox's murder matched that found in the New York subway station only months ago.

However it has now been revealed that the potential clue was tainted evidence - embarrassing the NYPD and enraging the OWS movement who took the opportunity to say the police should have made better use of their resources than collecting their DNA.

The only suspect in the Fox murder case was Dimitry Sheinman, 47, who has since moved to South Africa. He was never charged in connection with the murder of the young actress.

Sheinman returned to the U.S. last month, to share information he had received from a psychic as to who really killed the young woman. He remains a suspect but has penned a book about his experiences.

Miss Fox was a promising student studying at the prestigious Julliard School of performing arts at the time of her death.
