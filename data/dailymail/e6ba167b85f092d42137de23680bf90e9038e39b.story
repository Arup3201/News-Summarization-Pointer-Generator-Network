As shark sightings and beach closures continue across the country, swimmers have found another way to keep themselves entertained on the sand.

Selfies have emerged on social media of the fearless and brave beachgoers posing in front of a shark warning sign looking seemingly happy as they smile for the cameras.

It comes after hundreds of swimmers were forced to dash for the shores at Manly and North Steyne beaches on the Northern Beaches of Sydney after a shark was spotted in the water on Sunday.

Instagram photographs show beachgoers and local residents posing alongside the ‘Shark sighted today – Enter the water at your own risk’ signs as they strike a pose.

One woman was spotted looking afraid and screaming for help in front of the warning sign. She captions: 'Hanging with the sharks of oz. #sharksighting #manlybeach #straya #aintskeerd'

Despite the warning, a young boy posted a selfie with a caption saying that he still entered while other swimmers were spotted in the background casually enjoying their day in the water.

One woman shared a cheeky photograph of herself with the warning sign in the back, as she appears to look afraid and it seems she was screaming, presumably for help.

Others smiled happily as they pointed at the sign to capture the moment while others said the shark scare didn't stop them from entering the water.

The selfie craze follows as a procession of sharks alerted swimmers and surfers out of the water at the weekend as beachgoers continue to upload their selfies of the sign as a keepsake.

Not even a shark sighting deterred one man from entering the water. He captioned: 'Needless to say, I still entered #nofear #manlybeach #sharkscare'

While Newcastle beaches have reopened on Monday after being closed for a record of 10 consecutive days following the sighting of a great white shark off the coast.

A five metre shark was first spotted off Merewether beach on January 10, prompting the closure of all six beaches across the coastline of NSW as several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water.

Several other sharks, including tiger sharks feeding on dolphins were seen along the coast but authorities have reopened the beaches after jetski patrols found no sign of the sea creatures.

Last Friday, a 17-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark after he went spearfishing off Mollymook beach on the South Coast of NSW.

Sam Smith was taken to Milton Ulladulla hospital where he is in a stable condition, and later flown to Sydney for specialist treatment.
