Bundle of joy: Mother Sonia Banks with baby Phoebe who was born on the train to Maidstone last night

You can just imagine the collective eye-roll when the guard announced the packed 18.18 from London Victoria was going to be delayed.

No doubt those eyes stood out on stalks when they heard it was because a woman had gone into labour.

Fifteen minutes later, Sonia Banks, 22, had given birth a baby girl on the carriage floor – to the cheers (and perhaps a few tears)of fellow passengers.

Miss Banks's waters broke on Thursday afternoon but she was told by hospital staff in Tunbridge Wells to go home because her baby was 'not going to be born for a long time'.

To get home to Cuxton in Kent, she boarded the commuter train to Ashford International at Borough Green, with her boyfriend Allan Stanley, 21, and his mother Mari-Anne.

But less than five minutes later, as the train approached West Malling, Miss Banks turned to them and said: 'I've just felt a contraction and I'm going into labour.'

The family feared the worst because Miss Banks had a traumatic birth when she had her first child four years ago.

Luckily, an off-duty midwife, off-duty police officer and a nurse happened to be on board and sprang into action as the train came to a halt.

The policeman ushered passengers into another carriage as the midwife, nurse and Mrs Stanley helped Miss Banks on to the floor – while Southeastern train guard Colin Brooker kept the passengers informed of progress.

Phoebe Stanley was delivered within 15 minutes, weighing 6lbs 13oz.

And remarkably, the train was delayed for just 37 minutes. Mother and daughter were taken to hospital but were released yesterday.

Happy family: Father Allan Stanley spoke of his amazement that his daughter was born on board a train

Miss Banks said: 'I was petrified. 
One minute I was sitting in the seat talking to my mum on the phone, the
next I started contractions and then it all happened so quickly.

'I just thought "I don't want to give birth on a train – it's not very dignified".

'When Phoebe arrived I was shell-shocked. It's still sinking in. She was a week early so we weren't really expecting her.

'Overwhelmed': Father Allan Stanley described the birth of his daughter on the train as 'surreal'

'Apparently everyone was cheering us 
when we were taken off the train to an ambulance but like any new mum 
all I could concentrate on was my baby.'

Mr Stanley, a chef, said: 'I can't 
believe my daughter was born on a train. It still seems so surreal. I 
was so worried when we knew the baby was coming.

'But to be there when she was born was just amazing. We're just so grateful to everyone who helped.'

Drama: Passengers waited here on the train and on the platform as Phoebe came into the world, and clapped and cheered as they were taken to hospital

Florist Mrs Stanley, 40, said: 'I want to say a really big thank you to all the passengers who were so patient.

'None of the passengers in our 
carriage complained when they were asked to move to another carriage or 
get off the train. They were all so nice and concerned. I think they 
just wanted to make sure there was a happy outcome.

'When the driver announced the baby 
had been born everyone was clapping and cheering, it was so lovely. I 
had tears in my eyes.'

Mr Brooker said: 'We had everyone we needed right there on the train. We were only missing a vicar to baptise the baby!

'In all my 41 years working on the railway I've never experienced anything like this. It was amazing.'

Many passengers took to Twitter to detail their unusual train journey home.

One wrote: 'O Lordy. Woman on my 
train just gave birth to a daughter. Eventful journey. Nice to hear 
train driver making such lovely announcements.' Southeastern announced 
that the carriage would be named after Phoebe.
