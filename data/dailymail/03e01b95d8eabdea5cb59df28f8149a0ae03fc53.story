A homeowner was left stunned when she spotted the face of a witch starring back at her when she looked into her garden - only to discover it was just an eerie-looking bush.

June Brady, 65, glanced out of her back window and saw what looked like a witch peering back at her.

But on closer inspection Mrs Brady, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, discovered the witch's face had been formed from the leaves of a bush.

Witchy wonder: June Brady, 65, spotted this creepy face staring back at her when she looked out her garden window

Eerie: Mrs Brady took photos of the green witch which even appears to have a hooked nose

The mother-of-one said: 'I looked out at the garden and I saw a witch's face - my heart flipped. It was a dark night which made it very spooky.'

Mrs Brady quickly took a picture of the creepy sight so she could prove to friends and family what she had seen.

And with its green face and large hooked nose, it's easy to see why Mrs Brady thought the green bush looked like something far more sinister.

The picture even bears the a striking resemblance to the TV witch Grotbags.

Played Carol Lee Scott, the vivid green witch was a popular children's character on ITV throughout the 80s and the early 90s.

But when Mrs Brady went to inspect the witch she discovered it was just a bunch of leaves on a garden bush
