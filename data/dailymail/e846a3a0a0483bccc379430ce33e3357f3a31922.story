A woman found her fiancé on a Facebook selling page after he jokingly offered himself up for sale.

Beckie Bennett, 43, was browsing her local buy and sell Facebook group when an unusual offer caught her eye - a local man had advertised himself as 'house trained' and up for sale.

Richard Yardley, 38, had written the post as a joke. But when Beckie commented to check out the goods on offer, he asked her on a date.

Beckie Bennett and Richard Yardley met after Richard jokingly advertised himself on a buy and sell Facebook page and Beckie commented on his picture. The pair are now engaged

Following their unusual introduction, the couple are now engaged after Richard proposed, and mother-of-three Beckie says she has bagged herself the best bargain ever - the man of her dreams.

She said: 'We're going to tie the knot next August, and it's all thanks to that Facebook page. Richard is the best thing I've ever won on the buy, sell and swap page.'

In May 2013, Beckie, of Harbury, near Leamington Spa, logged on to Facebook to search for furniture for her son's new flat.

Cheeky blonde Richard had jokingly posted a picture of himself on to the page with the caption: 'man for sale - free to a good home.'

Beckie said: 'I saw the picture of Richard with his glasses on and I decided to play along.

'I commented to check out Richard's credentials. It's the first rule of Facebook shopping - make sure what you're buying is up to scratch.

''Do you clean, wash and drive?' I asked. Within seconds he'd replied, 'all of the above.''

From the moment they met Beckie says she and Richard were inseparable, he has now proposed and they plan to get married later this year

After the exchange Beckie was surprised to see that Richard had deleted the post from the Facebook page.

Beckie, who is mother to Ashley, 23, Daniel, 15, and Phoebe, seven, said: 'At first I thought I might have offended him, I was only trying to tease him.'

Moments later her notification panel pinged and Richard had sent her her a message.

The message read: 'How about this for spontaneity - lets meet for a drink.' The pair met up at a pub the next night and immediately hit it off.

Beckie said: 'When I met him I thought he seemed really sweet. It was a brilliant first date. I arrived and like a gentleman he was already waiting outside with a drink for me.

'We laughed all night long. It was a whirlwind. From that moment on we were inseparable.' 

Richard proposed to Beckie with a ring which he hid in the glove compartment of his car

Beckie posted on the buy and sell wall to tell the rest of the users that she and Richard were engaged 

Two months into the relationship another visitor to the site asked what had happened to the man who had advertised himself.

Beckie replied, announcing: 'Sorry girls, you know the rules.. I commented first, so first dibs!'

Richard popped the question by hiding the ring in his car and asking Beckie to fetch something out of his glove compartment.

She said: 'He asked me to go fetch something from the car.. I went out thinking it would be some shopping.

'I ran back inside with the ring shouting 'yes' over and over again. He didn't even have time to ask the question.'

The couple plan on getting married in August this year. Beckie wrote on the Facebook page recently to let everyone know that they were getting married.

She said: 'I never in a million years thought I would bag a husband from a Facebook page. He is such a romantic but he's a joker as well. The way we got together makes everyone laugh.'
