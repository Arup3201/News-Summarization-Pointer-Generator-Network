With recent research revealing that 65 per cent of women are unhappy with their engagement ring, the pressure is most certainly on for men about to propose to find the perfect design.

With so many styles on the market, it can be an overwhelming experience for the clueless men out there; but one entrepreneur thinks he may have the answer.

Manu Bhardwaj, a former Ministry of Defence Mechanical Engineer has launched Hot Pink, a bespoke jewellery design service which allows customers to design their rings from scratch, using the latest in 3D technology.

Job made easy: An entrepreneur has launched 3D technology which aims to make buying the perfect engagement ring easy for men- because they can design it themselves from scratch

Going completely against the high street
‘cookie cutter’ model, the Hot Pink appointment service involves the customer working with jewellery experts to design a bespoke ring for their partner, choosing everything from the cut, colour, stones and style.

Using software the ring is built in realistic 3D, and to enable shoppers to see and touch an example of the ring as it will look when finished they hold a large number of prototype rings in-store, made from low cost alloys and are finished with imitation stones.

The groom-to-be is given a design pack to take away and present to their partner upon proposing, or a low-cost replica version of the ring made with Swarovski crystals instead of precious stones can be ordered.

Manu, 30, from Coventry, was inspired to create the company 
when he wanted to design an engagement ring for his now wife, and found 
the High Street options didn’t offer enough value for money and lacked 
creative vision.

Speaking about the technology he uses, Manu said: 'Most of our customers want to choose a ring based on a central stone type. We have a live database of actual gemstones that are available from our suppliers.

'Once you have selected your stone, our ring design experts will start designing your perfect ring. We will use the actual dimensions of the stone that you have selected.

'Throughout the design process you can see how the design decisions you make will affect the total cost so you can budget for what you want, with no nasty surprises at the end.

'Once you have selected your gemstones for your ring, you have the freedom to customise every detail of the ring.

'Once you have created your final design, a full HD 3D photorealistic model will be shown to you as it would look on a hand.'

Manu promises that if customers aren't satisfied after the consultation, they are under no obligation to buy the ring.

He also warns that due to daily prices fluctuations in the value of precious metals and gem stone costs, the cost of a shopper's design may vary over time until they commit to purchase.

Speaking about the innovative software, Manu said: 'The
designer is essentially the translator between the customer and the 
software. It’s our job to translate the client’s vision of their perfect
ring into reality.

'When I was searching for my wife’s engagement ring, 
the lack of control in the design process frustrated me, and I didn’t 
want to sacrifice quality or design freedom which can be the case with 
traditional design methods.'

Manu set up the bespoke jewellery company in 2011, and this month he will be pitching his idea on BBC Two's Dragons’ Den.

'Dragons’ Den has helped to kick start great businesses such as Mydish.co.uk and Thermo Logistics.

'Appearing on the show was a once in a lifetime opportunity to follow in the footsteps of some admirable British Businesses. I was eager to meet The Dragons’, and show them how Hot Pink goes and above and beyond a traditional jewellers with its innovative business model.'
