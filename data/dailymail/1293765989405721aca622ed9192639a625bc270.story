A woman in New Mexico is accused of pulling a gun on a Comcast engineer after he informed her about additional installation fees that she claims she didn't know about.

Gloria Baca-Lucero, 48, of Albuquerque was arrested on Monday following the altercation at her home and has been charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Cable guy Clifton Ratliff had arrived at Baca-Lucero’s home earlier that day to install Comcast services.

Before getting started, he informed her that there would be a fee. Baca-Lucero said she thought the work would be free and refused to sign for the charges. Upset, she then called customer services who confirmed the fee.

Baca-Lucero still refused to pay and so Ratliff started putting his tools away, reports the Albuquerque Journal.

He told cops that his customers then grabbed one of his tool bags and took it into her home.

When he went to get it back, she pulled out a black handgun and pointed it at his torso, the complaint states.

Ratliff says he then called 911 and left because he 'didn't want to get shot.'

The argument started after Baca-Lucero was informed that she would have to pay additional fees to receive Comcast services

When police arrived, they searched Baca-Lucero's home and found a black Glock, along with a Glock magazine and 11 rounds. They also found the tool bag - with a value of $400 - according to the court document.

Baca-Lucero was arrested and charged on Monday, but released later the same day.

She confirmed to officers that she told Ratliff that he couldn’t have his tools, but claimed to have told him that his supervisor would need to come pick them up.
