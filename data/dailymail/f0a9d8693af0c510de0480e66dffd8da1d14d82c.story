Guilty: 21-year-old Jeremy Johnson admitted in court Monday that he was guilty of accidentally killing two of his football teammates in a car crash in 2011

A former Missouri Southern State University football player admitted in court today to accidentally killing two of his friends in a car crash.

21-year-old Jeremy Johnson was behind the wheel in December 2011 when the car crashed into a tractor trailer on an interstate between Joplin and Springfield.

At about 2:30am on Dec. 2 Johnson drove off the road and into the median. The SVU overturned and landed on the other side of the freeway. 

One of the passengers, Diondre Johnson, was thrown from the vehicle.

Shortly after the car was hit by a tractor trailer, which killed another passenger, Michael McCrimmons.

Both Johnson and McCrimmons were teammates of Johnson's on the football team.

According to UPI, the men, who were all 19 at the time, had been driving home from a nightclub in Joplin.

Another passenger, Missouri Southern golfer Patrick Holt, was injured but survived. 

Last July, Johnson had plead not-guilty,
but changed that statement on Monday saying he was guilty of two counts
of involuntary manslaughter.

Police say 
that Johnson had been drinking at the time, and that his blood-alcohol 
content was .11 per cent, above the legal limit of  .08.

Johnson will be sentenced on Aug. 19.

The wreckage: Johnson drove over the median and crashed the car on the other side of the freeway where a tractor trailer ploughed through the SUV
