Throughout his short life, young Cody Green had admired the bravery of the U.S. Marines.

But after years spent battling leukaemia, it was the youngster's courage fighting cancer which inspired his heroes to honour his bravery.

The 12-year-old from Indiana had suffered from the disease throughout his life. First diagnosed just before his 
second birthday, he had beaten leukaemia three times - but the 
chemotherapy had reduced his immune system and, last weekend, he died from a
 fungus which attacked his brain.

And standing guard outside his hospital room that night was a local Marine named Mark Dolfini who was so moved by Cody's continued cancer battle that he decreed the 12-year-old to be a honorary member of the elite military unit.

Sick: The 12-year-old had been seriously ill for much of his short life, but his courage impressed the Marines

Honour guard: Mark Dolfini, 39, a local Marine, was so moved by Cody's story that he helped make the 12-year-old an honorary Marine before he passed on Saturday due to an infection related to cancer

Close family friend Keristen Ford told MailOnline that Cody was a 'witty' and determined child who never let his continued battles with cancer hurt his spirits.

'He was very aware of his illness he knew exactly what medications he was on and what time he should have them,' Ms Ford said.

'He knew that by him knowing when he had to take his medications and what they were, his mom had to worry less. He was very worried about anyone leaving sleep over him.

His mother Tracy Green certainly had a lot on her mind over the past few months, as Cody had two younger brothers and two older stepbrothers.

On top of that, Ms Green was seriously injured at the Indiana State Fair as the country band Sugarland's stage fell. Seven people were killed, and Ms Green was one of the 58 injured. She had to have 30 staples in her skull and had steel rods and pins placed in her leg.

As she recovered, Cody was characteristically caring, helping his mother wash her hair when she had trouble moving in the months following the August 2011 stage collapse.

Fighting the long fight: Cody had leukaemia three times, and at the time of his death he was technically cancer-free but died due to an infection

'When I started walking again after 
the incident, he was so worried about me, saying "you need to keep your 
feet up Mom! You have to watch your step,"' Mrs Green told MailOnline.

'He never complained, he never said "why me?" or "I don't want to do this".

'If he got sick, he would finish and 
say "I'm sorry" because you were holding the bucket for him. I always 
told him that he had nothing to be sorry about.'

Cody's repeat cancer battle inspired 
the local Marines, who thought 'he’s fought as hard as any marine has 
and because of that we’re going to honour him'.

They planned to give him a complete 
colour guard spectacle, but because Cody's condition was less stable 
following a stem cell procedure on March 12, they had to suspend those 
plans for fear of infecting Cody's sensitive immune system.

'He had a passion for our country and
 our military and it was more the marines got sparked in Cody and they 
heard of his battle,' Ms Ford told MailOnline.

The youngster's father David Snowberger told local station WLFI: 'They decided Cody, with the strength and honour and courage he showed through the whole thing, he should be a Marine.'

When Cody's condition took a turn for
 the worse on Friday night, his family got in touch with a local Marine 
who said that he would rush to the hospital to be with the boy during 
his final hours.

Former Marine Mark Dolfini, 39, who was introduced to Cody through Mr Snowberger, presented the boy with a flag and Marine navigator wings.

'Unfortunately, Cody was not awake, 
he was on a ventilator, but we believe he knew,' Ms Ford said, having 
been at the hospital at the time of the ceremony.

Courage: Cody may have admired the strength of the marines - but they 
admired him as he bravely fought cancer and his father David Snowberger,
 right, said the Marines decided Cody should be an honorary member

Long disease: Cody was first diagnosed with leukemia when he was 22 months old

In keeping with the Corps motto of Semper
 Fidelis, latin for always faithful, the Marine stood post outside of 
Cody's door all night, saluting Mrs Green as she went in and out of the 
room, right up until Cody passed on Saturday.

'The night before Cody passed, he stood guard at Cody's door at the 
hospital all night long for eight hours straight,' Mr Snowberger said. 

Mr Dolfini, who was initially 
hesitant to go public for fear it would take away from Cody's story, 
spoke with MailIOnline, telling how he knew he had to spend the night 
guarding Cody's door because it was what he deserved.

'There was no question that was my calling that night,' he said.

'I didn’t give myself a time constraint and I knew I was going to be there as long as I could be.'

The Marine Corp's website states that
 the title of 'Honorary Marine' reinforces the special bond between the 
American people and the Corps by 'recognising individuals in the 
civilian community who have made extraordinary contributions to the 
Marine Corps.

Support: Cody's friends at Carroll Consolidated School made him signs during his repeated hospital stays

Plea: Cody's mother issued a heartfelt plea from a 'worried and scared momma' on Facebook in the days before he died

Turn for the worse: Cody, seen here with Dave Snowberger, went in for chemotherapy and an stem cell transplant on March 2 and stayed in the hospital for the almost two month until his death

'The title Marine is a revered designation that affords a special distinction to those who earn it.

'Therefore, only the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) can officially designate an individual as an "Honorary Marine".'

Cody - described by his father as 'a 
comedian' - was a fifth grade student at Carroll Elementary School in 
Flora, and his friends spent the first day back at school after his 
death honouring his memory.

Balloons in his favourite colour of 
green were released, carrying messages into the sky; green ribbons were 
tied round the trees and friends hugged each other while wearing green 
T-shirts and chanting his name.

'He was very witty,' Ms Ford told MailOnline.

Memorial: All of the children at Cody's school had off on Monday and the school held a ceremony where they traded memories about their 'witty' friend

Tribute: Cody's school friends release green balloons in his memory

'He was very comical. He always made 
you laugh, and he would always one up you because you couldn’t come up 
with good comeback quick enough for him! It was as if he had a whole 
book of them or something!'

His obituary on Jconline reads: 'He 
never asked "Why Me," and fought the illness with grace and humility, 
never complaining about his treatment or care, saying "Thank you" to the
 many health care professionals that cared for him.

'Cody had a great sense of humor and 
he was always worried about everybody else and their well-being, he 
dearly loved his family.'

A memorial service for the 12-year-old will be held at Carroll Elementary School this weekend and the Marines will be giving Cody a full military funeral, full with a color guard, tap, and 21-gun salute.

All contributions will be donated to the cancer unit at Riley Children's Hospital.
