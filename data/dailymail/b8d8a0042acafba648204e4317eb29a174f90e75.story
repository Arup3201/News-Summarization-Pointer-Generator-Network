Most meat-eaters would physically cringe at the phrase 'plant-based' diet, but one woman has made it her aim to educate the world about the benefits of going vegan.

Cookbook author Dreena Burton, 44, stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years and during that time, has written five best-selling cookbooks.

The Vancouver-based author's most recent, Plant-Powered Families, includes more than 100 whole-food, vegan recipes  to help families that want to transition to a meat-free diet.

Cookbook author, Dreena Burton stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years ago and in that period has written five best-selling cookbooks

Dreena's recipe for Cinnamon French Toast omits eggs and instead uses white chia seeds, cashews and unsweetened dairy-free milk

Dreena, who writes a blog as well, has raised her three young children (ages 6, 14 and 10) as vegans, and the recipes supposedly cater to everyone from fussy eaters to packing school launches.

The 'delicious, creative, fun and nutritious' book also includes guides to healthy and balanced meal plans for all ages, including a morning snack, an afternoon snack and even a dessert after dinner.

Burton highlights key superfoods such as quinoa and kale, and flags easy ways to incorporate them into an everyday diet.

She also underlines more unconventional food alternatives, such as using vegetables like artichoke in place of meat in a burger patty and use sunflower seeds to change up the texture.

The mother-of-three also recreates iconic American meals with vegan alternatives, such as the 'sloppy joe', which is usually comprised of beef. onions and ketchup in a bun.

Burton instead, utilises oats, green lentils and red bell peppers. 

When it comes to desserts, the recipes become truly inventive, with brownies that omit eggs and instead use kidney beans, dates and a potato.

Dreena became a vegan in her twenties and at first made subtle dietary changes.

'I wanted to improve my health. I began learning about the health benefits of a plant-based diet (and the health risks associated with consumption of animal products).

Dreena's three daughters (pictured left to right - ages 6, 14 and 10) are also vegans. Dreena has said: 'I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself!'

'After making some changes over a period of weeks, I first became vegetarian, and then vegan a few months after. 

'I felt so much better, and all beneficial aspects of the diet (health, environment, animal welfare) connected for me.' 

Her cookbook also includes healthy drinks options such as the pumpkin pie smoothie.

As well as a variety of seasonings, she also incorporates pumpkin purée, mango chunks, pitted dates and banana slices - all blended up. 

Her breakfast options include  delicious cinnamon french toast, which omits the use of eggs for ingredients such as white chia seeds, cashews and unsweetened dairy milk.

In the recipe book Plant-Powered Families, Dreena makes meat-less alternatives to burger patties by substituting beef or chicken for artichokes

Dreena believes that all the beneficial aspects of being a vegan, including health, environment and animal welfare added up for her

As for her three children, raising them as vegan was ever the only option.

Dreena says: 'It was very natural for me. I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself! 

'As a new parent, I was of course cautious and did my research. 

'But ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods, and protect them from the health risks of meat and dairy consumption.'

Dreena only uses simple and natural ingredients such as pumpkin to create her whole-food, vegan recipes

Dreena cooks delicious vegan dishes with her 6-year-old daughter. She says: 'Ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods.'

It turns out Dreena's strong belief and extensive list of recipes have attracted attention from high-reaching places. 

Dreena says: 'Several years ago an article was written in the Chicago-Sun Times about Barack Obama's fitness trainer (Cornell McClellan). 

'He was interviewed and referenced my third title, Eat, Drink & Be Began, as "delicious way to learn how to become a responsible, and healthful, vegan." Almost a White House shout-out!' 

Dreena's biggest reason for going vegan? 'It's just a beautiful way to eat. The foods are full of vibrant colors, textures, flavours, and nutrients, there is no animal suffering, and it's gentler to our planet as a whole.' 

Makes 16 brownies

Ingredients 

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line an 8" × 8" brownie pan with parchment paper.

Using a small or mini food processor, puree the beans, dates, potato, tahini, and coconut butter until smooth, and then add the maple syrup and milk and puree again.

Add the cocoa powder, sugar, arrowroot, vanilla bean powder, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt to the processor and puree until combined. (If your processor is too small, transfer the date mixture to a bowl, and use a spatula to incorporate the dry ingredients.) Stir in the chocolate chips.

Transfer the mixture to the brownie pan, and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake for 22–24 minutes (brownies will firm with cooling and are more fudgy with less baking, so don’t overbake).

Remove, let cool completely, frost if desired, and cut into squares. 

Makes 5 patties

Ingredients

In a food processor, add and the artichoke hearts, rice, nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds, parsley, miso, Dijon mustard, sea salt, garlic, black pepper, and vinegar and puree.

Once the mixture is coming together and a little sticky, add the oats and pulse through several times. Refrigerate for an hour if possible (it will make it easier to shape the patties).

After chilling, take out scoops of the mixture and form burgers in your hands. I scoop generously with an ice cream scoop, roughly 1/3-½ cup for each.

To cook, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for 5–7 minutes on the first side, and then another 3–5 minutes on the second side until a little golden. Serve with the fixings of your choice.
