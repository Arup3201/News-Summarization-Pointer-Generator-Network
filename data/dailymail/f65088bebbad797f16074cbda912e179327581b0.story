Former Manchester United trainee Josh King scored a famous FA Cup hat-trick as Stoke City boss Mark Hughes suffered a nightmare return to Ewood Park.

Rovers fans mockingly chanted 'Hughesy, Hughesy, What's the score?' as their former manager watched his Premier League outfit collapse after being reduced to ten men on the stroke of half-time.

Despite going in front through Peter Crouch, Stoke couldn't handle King, a 23-year-old Norwegian-born striker who left Old Trafford after making just two first-team appearances and was only playing on Saturday because Rovers star striker Jordan Rhodes needed a rest.

He drew his side level with a header and after Rudy Gestede had put the Championship underdogs ahead with a penalty, King added two more in the second half by out-sprinting the Stoke back line.

By that time, Stoke were a man short with Geoff Cameron dismissed for the foul that led to Gestede's spot-kick.

'Kingy will get the headlines and rightly so,' said Rovers manager Gary Bowyer. 'He has had a great education at Manchester United and shown here what he is capable of.

'The challenge for him now is to produce it on a regular basis. What can I tell you about him? He lives in Manchester and drives a car that's too fast, probably the same speed he can run.'

Hughes, who was Blackburn's manager between 2004 and 2008 before leaving for Manchester City, wasn't happy that his players wilted so easily under pressure. 'Blackburn were direct but that is valid. They executed their game plan better than us. I have no complaints,' he said.

Even so, Hughes will be hurting this morning. He won the FA Cup four times as a player and fancied emulating the Stoke team that reached the final in 2011, hence he named his strongest side - save for regular cup keeper Jack Butland for Asmir Begovic.

It started well for the visitors when Peter Crouch turned in a Victor Moses corner to open the scoring after 10 minutes and they should have added a second when Mame Biram Diouf blazed over from six yards.

However, Stoke's new vulnerability at set pieces cost them after 36 minutes, Shane Duffy headed a corner goalwards and King got the final touch off his head from a couple of yards to equalise.

When referee Anthony Taylor signalled eight minutes of injury time at the end of the first half – due to a shoulder injury to Ben Marshall - Stoke were rocking badly.

Butland fluffed a cross and needed Philipp Wollscheid to clear off the line. Stoke's indecision was becoming a problem and in the next attack, Gestede was brought down by Geoff Cameron, and Mr Taylor pointed the spot and sent off the American defender.

'The letter of the law says he has to be sent off,' said Bowyer, and Hughes wasn't ready to argue. Gestede coolly sent Butland the wrong way from the spot for his 13th goal of the season.

Hughes sent on Andy Wilkinson as a half-time substitute to cover the loss of Cameron but within 10 minutes Stoke had conceded twice more and were as good as out of the cup.

Both goals, after 50 and 55 minutes, were similar. King's pace on the break taking him clear of the Stoke defence and finished off with low finishes past Butland.

He was so quick for the first that Marc Muniesa pulled a hamstring trying to catch him and after collapsing in agony, needed help as he hobbled off to be replaced by Steve Sidwell. King then outpaced Steven Nzonzi to complete his treble.

Stoke's miserable day was completed when their fans were involved in minor skirmishes with stewards who had moved into their section with a stretcher after  had fainted. Stoke will launch their own investigation after claims that punches were thrown and one person suffered injuries.
