Moscow's ambassador to Britain was summoned to the Foreign Office last night after two Russian bombers flew over the English Channel.

In scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, the diplomat was asked to account for the incursion of the military aircraft, which caused civil flights to be diverted or delayed on Wednesday.

The long-range Tu-95 'Bear' bombers flew within 25 miles of the coast – through an area busy with passenger aircraft – forcing the RAF to scramble Typhoon jets.

The fly-by is the most daring yet by the Russian military and comes amid worsening relations between Westminster and the Kremlin – highlighted this week by the opening of the inquiry into the murder of former KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko.

The Foreign Office said Wednesday's incident was part of an 'increasing pattern of out-of-area operations by Russian aircraft'. A spokesman added: 'While the Russian planes did not enter sovereign UK airspace and were escorted by RAF Typhoons throughout the time they were in the UK area of interest, the Russian planes caused disruption to civil aviation.

'That is why we summoned the Russian ambassador today to account for the incident.' Experts said Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying nuclear missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression.

They said the manoeuvre in the English Channel could have been designed to probe the RAF's speed of reaction.

But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon last month warned that Russia's aggressive incursions could accidentally down a passenger jet and accused president Vladimir Putin of playing a 'provocative and dangerous' game.

RAF jets were scrambled more than 100 times last year to escort Russian bombers away from British airspace.

In Wednesday's incursion, the Bears travelled right round the British Isles and were detected by long-range radars before being escorted away by RAF fighter jets based in Scotland and Lincolnshire.

Although the aircraft were travelling in international airspace, they were deviating from a standard route, triggering a 'quick reaction alert'.

An RAF spokesman said: 'The operations room was both calm and focused. We constantly train for these scenarios so that we are well-rehearsed and ready to maintain the integrity of our airspace.'

Russian defence officials defended the incursion as part of a 19-hour 'air patrolling mission task' through the Barents and Norwegian Seas and Atlantic Ocean.

A spokesman revealed that Norwegian and French aircraft also followed the bombers, which carried out two aerial refuelling manoeuvres.
