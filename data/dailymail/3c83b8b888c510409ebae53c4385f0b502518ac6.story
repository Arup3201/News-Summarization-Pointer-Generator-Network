Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and the upper chamber's new leader, doesn't blame the majority of Americans for having a poor opinion of the legislative branch.

Americans are 'right' to think Congress is doing a lousy job, he said in a joint interview with House Speaker John Boehner that aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes. 

'I wouldn't vote to approve this Congress,' he said. 'I can tell you the Senate has been essentially dysfunctional for four years. I mean, it's basically been shut down.' 

McConnell's own management style has come under scrutiny this week from Democrats who argue that they're being unfairly silenced. Meanwhile, Boehner is taking fire from Democrats over an invite he extended to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu behind their backs.

In power for less than a month, Republican leaders are learning just how heavy the head is that wears the crown.

During the first week of Congress, Boehner faced a revolt from 25 members of his own caucus demanding more conservative leadership.

Boehner overcame to the siege and successfully won reelection to the speakership, but bad blood between the Ohio lawmaker and the right wing of the Republican Party appeared to linger as the 60 Minutes interview commenced last week.

Defending his 'voting record is as conservative as anybody here,' Boehner went after the Tea Party's tactics. 

'Frankly, a lot is being driven by national groups here in Washington who have raised money and just beating the dickens out of me,' he told 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley, adding that they do it 'because it works.'

'They raise money, put it in their pocket, and pay themselves big salaries,' he said, calling the effort to keep the Republican Party unified 'a work in progress.'

Boehner made himself the target of Democratic scorn this week after he invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress without consulting his colleagues across the aisle or the White House, which typically coordinates visits from foreign heads of state.

The gesture, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said, was 'inappropriate.'

Pelosi, who is Boehner's predecessor, warned that the power of the House Speaker is 'not to be squandered.'

President Barack Obama's spokesman called the end-run a breach of 'protocol,' and the White House said Obama would not meet with Netanyahu during the visit, now scheduled for March 3, due to the proximity of Israel's elections.

Confronted by Pelley over the blindside, Boehner stated: 'I gave 'em a heads up that morning.'

'But there's nobody in the world who can talk about the threat of radical terrorism, nobody can talk about the threat that the Iranians pose, not just to the Middle East and to and to Israel, our longest ally but to the entire world, but Bibi Netanyahu,' he added.

Boehner affirmed his support for new sanctions on Iran, which Netanyahu backs but the White House doesn't, and predicted that the House would approve additional punishments on the Middle Eastern country if it doesn't cease its nuclear program. 

He also confirmed that the House would pass a measure giving Obama the authority to keeping fighting ISIS.

The GOP leader defended his decision to invite Netanyahu to speak to Congress, saying Obama brushed over the terrorist threat that America faces in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.

'The president is trying to act like it's not there. But it is there. And it's going to be a threat to our homeland if we don't address it in a bigger way,' he stated.

Prodded by 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley to classify Obama's propositions as dead or alive, Boehner grimaced and said the president's tax proposal is 'dead, real dead'

McConnell has had a few run-ins of his own with Democrats since taking the helm of the Senate earlier this month.

As the Senate Minority Leader, McConnell campaigned in the last election on a promise to restore order to the deliberative body. But Senate Democrats are now accusing him of taking too heavy a hand to the legislative process. 

McConnell kept the Senate in session until midnight on Thursday debating amendments to legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline as part of a commitment to have an open debate process.

Democratic Senators say that only Republican amendments received fair consideration, though.

'Not only did Senator McConnell go back on his word, he deprived the American people of a critical debate on these important amendments. He also poisoned the well just weeks into the new Congress,' California Sen. Barbara Boxer said in a Huffington Post op-ed, turning McConnell's own words back on him.

Both McConnell and Boehner repeatedly cautioned President Obama in November not to act on immigration lest he 'poison the well' before the new, two-year session of Congress even began.

Obama acted anyway, and now he and Republicans are tangling on numerous issues from the Keystone XL pipeline - which he says he'll veto - to tax hikes on wealthy Americans - a measure Republicans say they won't even bring up for debate.

Prodded by Pelley to classify the tax proposition as dead or alive, Boehner grimaced and said, 'Dead, real dead.'

He indicated that Republicans in Congress would be willing to work with Obama on his proposal to triple the childcare tax credit for working families, however.

'We're all for helping working class families around America,' Boehner said. 'I think we'll take a look at this when he sends his budget up, something that could be looked at in the overall context of simplifying our tax code and bringing rates down for everyone.'

Obama is set to present his budget to Congress on Tuesday, Feb. 6.

McConnell asserted that trade was another issue area that Republicans and Obama could likely meet in the middle on. The Senate leader pointed out that the president's comments on trade garnered a standing ovation from Members of Congress from both political parties during the State of the Union.
