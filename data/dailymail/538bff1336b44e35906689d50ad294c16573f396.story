Five commuters were left seriously hurt after two packed rush hour trains collided head on in Vienna yesterday.

A total of 41 people were injured when the two trains collided shortly before 9am in the Penzing district in the west of the Austrian capital.

Emergency services said yesterday that two of those injured, including one of the train drivers, were in a 'life-threatening' condition in hospital.

Rescue effort: Commuters are helped from the wreckage of the train by emergency services personnel following the crash

Injured: A commuter is stretchered away from the scene of the crash which saw 41 people hurt in total

Huge operation: Firefighters and emergency medical services work at the scene in Vienna

A huge rescue operation saw 25 fire engines, a helicopter and a special 'accident train' rescue the injured, with many having to be pulled from the wreckage using special cranes.

Emergency services spokesman Ronald Packert said: 'One good thing was that the crash happened right next to an emergency services station, meaning that our people were there in seconds.'

One of the five seriously injured passengers was trapped and had to be cut free by firefighters.

It took almost two hours to evacuate the two trains.

The cause of the crash was initially thought to have been a technical fault that caused both trains to be heading towards each other on the same track.

Head on: The two trains were heading towards each other on the same stretch of track in the west of the city

Hurt: Rescuers come to the aid of one injured person, five were seriously hurt in all with two people said to be in a 'life threatening' condition

Point of impact: An injured person is carried past the front of the two wrecked S45 trains yesterday

Austrian Railways spokesman Sarah Nettel said: 'One of the trains received a signal to proceed that it shouldn't have.'

But a later statement issued by OBB, Austria's state railway, said early investigations showed that a supervisor neglected to trip a signal after manually activating a rail switch.

The switch usually works automatically and sets off the signal but was stuck due to snow and ice.

Had the switch been activated, one of the trains would have been instructed to wait on a separate track until the other had gone past.

Last September a train derailed in the same area, without causing any injuries.

An inquiry blamed human error for that incident after a rail worker switched a point the wrong way.
