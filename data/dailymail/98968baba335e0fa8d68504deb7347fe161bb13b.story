Temperatures are set to soar to double figures this week before a cold snap with bitter winds from Iceland moves in across Britain just in time for Christmas.

Forecasters predict the mercury will rise to 12C across much of England and Wales this week before the cold weather returns on Friday, bringing strong winds and wintry showers.

Bookies have now slashed the odds for a white Christmas, with many believing the cold north-westerly winds from Iceland which will sweep across the country over the weekend will bring snow in time for December 25.

After a spell of spring-like weather this week, with above average temperatures of between 11C and 12C in the day and mild night-time temperatures of 8C to 9C, forecasters expect it to become progressively colder towards the end of the week.

Cold air from polar areas, such as Iceland and Greenland, will bring a noticeable drop in temperatures on Friday, with the cold snap set to last into next week.

Mark Wilson, a forecaster at the Met Office, said today would be mainly dry with sunny spells across much of Britain, with the exception of Scotland which will continue to see heavy, wintry showers and snow on higher ground.

After a cold night tonight, with temperatures dropping to freezing in towns and cities and -3C in rural areas, the mercury will begin to rise into the middle of the week.

By Wednesday, warmer winds from the Atlantic will sweep westerly across the country, bringer milder conditions and positively balmy temperatures of 12C.

The above-average temperatures will be felt across much of England and Wales, although northern Scotland will stay cold with wintry showers.

Despite the milder conditions, rain will sweep across the country on Wednesday and winds will gradually become stronger.

By the end of the week, the milder air and warmer conditions will be replaced by cold north-westerly winds, which will see temperatures plummet once again to freezing.

Mr Wilson said the colder airflow would see daytime temperatures of about 6C on Friday and into the weekend, and night-time temperatures of freezing or just below.

He said Scotland would continue to see cold, wintry showers, with snow continuing to fall on higher ground and, at times, on lower levels.

City: Bookies have now slashed the odds for a white Christmas, with punters convinced that the cold north-westerly winds sweeping across the country over the weekend will bring snow. Towns and cities, including London (pictured) will feel milder before the cold snap returns

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite added: ‘From Monday morning it is going to be milder, although there is the risk of some rain and wintry showers to the North where it will be colder.

‘The first real push of milder conditions is expected into Wednesday. This is due to a westerly pattern, though behind that it is again looking cooler.’

Although the Met Office has not yet issued its forecast for the Christmas period, bookmakers are becoming increasingly convinced that snow will fall on Christmas Day.

One company, Coral, has cut the odds on a white Christmas to 4/7 anywhere in Britain, with Aberdeen the favourite at 3/1.

A final forecast by the Met Office is usually made about five days before Christmas, but spokesman Nicola McGeady said: ‘The Christmas spirit is alive in punters, who are queuing up to bet on a white Christmas in their local city. As December 25 nears, the odds on it actually happening continue to fall.’

While snow could still be on the cards for the festive period in Britain, thousands of families due to leave the UK for an Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the prospect of a green Christmas.

Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 to December 13 after warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy.

But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs, which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain, found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering where inches of snow would usually have fallen by now.

The resort’s daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow was 77 miles away.
