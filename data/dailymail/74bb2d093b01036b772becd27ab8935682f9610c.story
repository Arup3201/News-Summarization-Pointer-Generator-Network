The parents of a baby who died while she was under the care of a childcare worker have called on the industry to introduce written guidelines on sleep and rest.

Indianna, five months old, was found unresponsive in her cot at the home of Tracey Cross, who provided services for the Sunshine Coast Family Day Care Scheme, on the morning of July 20, 2012.

An inquest into Indianna's death, which ended on Tuesday, was told by a pathologist the baby girl had died of sudden infant death syndrome, also known as SIDS,The Courier Mail reported.

The parents of the baby, Emma and Derek Hicks, said the inquest had identified issues  surrounding 'inconsistent and non-existent' safe sleeping practices, especially those in the childcare industry.

'Nothing will bring our beautiful daughter back, however it is through a medium such as this and a tragedy like this, that changes can be made to reduce the risks and of course, of this happening again to another family,' Mr Hicks said.

Mr Hicks described the ordeal as 'traumatic' for the family.

His wife said their daughter was a 'beautiful, pink, chubby, happy baby girl' who they 'loved very much'.

Pressure from the Hicks was backed up by Department of Education and Training officials, Regulation Assessment and Service Quality executive director Catherine O'Malley saying it was 'a good idea' to put written guidelines on sleep and rest in place for the industry.

It is not required under Queensland law, but she stressed if any were brought in they had to be 'non-prescriptive'.

Counsel assisting the Coroner Emily Cooper noted in her final submissions that despite the fact it was not possible to find out if Indianna's death could have been avoided, she would recommend looking at introducing sleep and rest policies. 

It comes after a tearful apology from Tracey Cross who was responsible for Indianna at the time of her death.

Ms Cross told the inquest on Monday and the five-month-old's parents she had blamed herself for Indianna's death until she found out the baby had died of SIDS months later.

'I thought I must have wrapped her wrong or suffocated her or something and I blamed myself for a very wrong time,' she said.

The home daycare operator said she went into shock immediately after the incident and did not know how to break the news to Ms Hicks when she arrived to pick up Indianna and her son Lachlan.

Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, left the Brisbane courtroom in tears as Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble

'I apologise to no end that we didn't get to Emma in time,' a sobbing Ms Cross said.

'But you've got to remember that ... by the time the ambulance took Indi ... I was beside myself.

'I knew Emma was going to turn up and I was worried about who was going to tell her. I knew I was in no position (to).'

Ms Hicks, who was sitting with her husband Derek, had to leave the courtroom in tears when Ms Cross described the moment she realised Indianna was in trouble.

Earlier in the two-day inquest, the grieving mother had told the court she had been reluctant to leave her daughter with Ms Cross, given Indianna had recently been to the doctor with a cold and still had a runny nose.

'I did question leaving her and she insisted that she would be fine,' Ms Hicks said.

Ms Hicks also said she was upset Ms Cross started caring for other children less than a week later, and that she had smelt cigarette smoke on Ms Cross and in her home, which she was also concerned about.

But in her evidence, Ms Cross rejected both points, saying she had never smoked and she returned to work only in a reduced capacity four weeks after the incident.

The inquest looked at the circumstances before Indianna's death, best sleeping practices for children aged three to six months, and how similar deaths could be prevented. 

Emma Hicks dropped Indianna off at the home of Ms Cross, who provided services for the Sunshine Coast Family Day Care Scheme, on the morning of July 20, 2012.

That afternoon, Ms Cross checked on Indianna to find her laying face down, limp and pale.

Attempts to revive her on the kitchen floor were unsuccessful and she was pronounced dead at Caloundra Hospital.
