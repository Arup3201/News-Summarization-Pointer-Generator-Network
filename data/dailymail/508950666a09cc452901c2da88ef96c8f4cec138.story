Executed: Jerry T. Jackson was put to death via lethal injection at Greensville Correctional Center in Virginia

A prisoner who raped and murdered an 88-year-old widow has been executed despite a campaign to have his death sentence commuted.  

Jerry Terrell Jackson, 30, was sentenced to death for the 2001 rape and murder of seamstress Ruth Phillips, 88, in her apartment in the city of Williamsburg, Virginia.

He was pronounced dead at 9.14pm on Thursday at Greensville Correctional Center after his execution went ahead despite a campaign to save his life by lawyers and a reverend who spent years visiting him in jail.

Jackson was close to a reprieve last 
year when U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema allowed a two-day 
evidentiary hearing in which Jackson's brother and sister testified 
about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father and stepfather 
while growing up.

Brinkema ordered that Jackson should 
receive a new sentencing hearing, saying the testimony 'painted a 
graphic picture of an unwarranted, continuous, sadistic course of 
conduct that terrorized and dehumanized Jackson throughout his 
childhood.'

However, earlier this year a federal appeals court overturned that ruling on a technicality.

Recently, Jackson's lawyers had 
argued that jurors should get a chance to hear the graphic details of 
Jackson's horrific childhood abuse.

But that argument was not enough to 
sway Governor Bob McDonnell, who denied a request to commute Jackson's 
sentence to life in prison last week.

On the day of the execution the U.S. Supreme Court denied a further request to block the execution.

In a recent telephone interview,
Jackson talked about the abuse, which began with a broken arm when he 
was 19 months old and continued with sexual abuse and beatings with a 
fist, belt and once a two-by-four for more than a decade.

Jackson acknowledged killing 
Mrs Phillips. Although he said it wasn't an excuse for what he did, Jackson 
said he didn't think it would have happened if he could have escaped the
abuse as a child.

'I don't think I would have ended up this way,' he said.

'I don't think I would be on death row.'

Jackson also expressed regret for his actions, saying: 'I'm sorry Mrs. Phillips lost her life due to something that I done.'

Victim: Ruth Phillips, 88, was raped and murdered by Jackson in her apartment in Williamsburg in 2001

'I'm sorry to Mr. Philips (her son) that he hurt so much. I'm sorry that he lost his mother.'

The Reverend Christine 
Payden-Travers, who has written to and visited Jackson for several 
years, called him a loyal and caring friend to many people.

She was with Jackson until he was 
taken into the death chamber. She then witnessed the execution, holding 
her bible, shutting her eyes and appearing to mouth a prayer.

She had called up until the final hours for Jackson's life to be spared.

'He is not a monster,' she said.

'There is good in him as well as the bad that he's done.

'I wanted him to know there was 
somebody with him who loved him and who saw him as a beloved child of 
God. And to know that in the midst of the state taking his life that 
there were people there that cared about him.'

The execution also went ahead despite controversy over the method used.

Due to a shortage of a drug called sodium thiopental, many states have replaced it with pentobarbital, an epilepsy drug manufactured by Danish firm Lundbeck.

Lundbeck is on record as opposing the 'distressing misuse' of its product and in a recent Georgia execution there was some evidence the inmate suffered when the drug was used.

Worried: Jerry Jackson had followed the controversy over the use of pentobarbital and had concerns about its use in his execution

Lawyers in several states have contested the use of pentobarbital, but federal courts have ruled that there is not enough significant evidence to prevent its use in two dozen executions this year.

Jackson had followed news reports about the use of pentobarbital, including the Georgia case, and was said to be concerned about its use.

When asked if he had any final words, Jackson shook his head and said 'no'.

While waiting for the cocktail of three drugs to be administered Jackson tapped his foot as he lay strapped to a stainless steel gurney. 

The execution team took around 15 minutes to insert two intravenous lines, one in each of his arms. Within four minutes of the lines being inserted, he was pronounced dead. Jackson was the 31st person to be executed in the U.S. this year.

Department of Corrections spokesman Larry Traylor said the execution team had carried out the order of execution in a 'professional and constitutional manner.'

The family of Ruth Phillips, Jackson's victim, did not witness the execution, though her son Richard - who found her dead in her apartment on August 26, 2001 - said the execution was long overdue.

Mrs Phillips, a widow for 30 years, had moved to Virginia from New Hampshire in the late 1990s so that she could be near her son and be safe.

She worked as a seamstress making slip covers and draperies up until her death.

During Jackson's court case it was revealed that he had broken into her home while she was asleep.

When awoke to find him rummaging through her purse and offered him anything he wanted if he would leave. Instead, he put a pillow over her face and raped her.

Jackson fled the scene in Mrs Philips' car and used the $60 he stole from her apartment to buy marijuana.

Rev. Paden-Travers and Jackson's lawyer declined to comment after the execution, the 32nd in the U.S. this year.
