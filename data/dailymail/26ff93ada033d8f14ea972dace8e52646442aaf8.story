Mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore has been remanded in custody after he was re-arrested over his connections to Italian crime gangs.

The 65-year-old appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today, where he was described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' by Adam Harbinson, representing the Italian authorities.

Wearing a beige sweater, blue shirt and black trousers, Rancadore was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court for a bail hearing next week.

The court appearance came after the Metropolitan 
Police's extradition unit arrested Rancadore at his home in Uxbridge, west 
London, yesterday, following a new European Arrest Warrant 
request from Italy.

Mr Harbinson told the court that the latest arrest warrant is identical to the previous one, save for assurances about the prison conditions he faced with in Italy.

It
 alleges that Rancadore has an 'outstanding sentence of seven years 
imprisonment to serve for participation in Mafia association' between 
1987 and 1995 in Palermo.

Rancadore, known as The Professor, was first arrested in August last year under a European Arrest Warrant for the same allegations, police said.

He had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years, who accused him of fleeing Italy, where he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections.

However, he won a battle against extradition back to his native Italy last month after Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that prison conditions in Rancadore’s home country would breach his human rights.

He was later told at another hearing that he would not face an appeal against the judge's ruling.

The court heard prosecutors had lodged an
 appeal against the decision to refuse Rancadore’s extradition, but it 
was not served to his lawyers within the seven-day time limit.

Granting Rancadore unconditional bail, District Judge Quentin Purdy said: 'You’re free to go as far as this court is concerned.'

Mr Purdy said unconditional bail had been granted 'as a matter of caution' until the High Court sanctions the dismissal of the appeal.

Mr Riddle reversed his original decision to extradite Rancadore, who has a serious heart condition, following concerns prison conditions would breach his human rights.

Rancadore and his wife moved with their two children to Uxbridge in 1994 and lived under the name of Skinner, the maiden name of Mrs Rancadore’s British mother.

Police arrested 'Marc Skinner' under a European arrest warrant on August 7 at the upmarket semi-detached home.

At a previous hearing, Mr Rancadore said he came to the UK to give his children 'a good life', and to bring his time in Italy to an end.

He said the trial in which he was a defendant in the mid-1980s - involving 460 defendants, one of whom was his father - was a 'terrible experience'.

Asked about changing his name to Marc Skinner, he said it was to end ties with Italy, adding: 'This was the only way.'

Rancadore said he did not even contact his mother or father back home, saying: 'I wanted to end everything with Sicily.'
