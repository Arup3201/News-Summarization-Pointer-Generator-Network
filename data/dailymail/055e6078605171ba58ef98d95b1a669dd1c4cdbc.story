An unemployed man who tortured a pensioner to death for her bank card PIN was today jailed for the rest of his life.

John Mason, 55, of Llandissilio, west Wales, beat Angelika Dries-Jenkins to death at her home in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, in a 'brutal and heartless' attack on June 1 last year.

Mason then stole the quiet 66-year-old divorcee's car and took £1,000 from her savings account to fund his impending wedding.

'Brutal and heartless murder': John Mason tricked his way into the home of pensioner Angelika Dries-Jenkins before torturing her for her bank card number and bludgeoning her to death with a blunt object

A jury at Swansea Crown Court took less than two hours today to find him unanimously guilty at the end of a two-week trial.

Mason, the son of the victim’s nextdoor neighbour, wore a hi-viz vest and posed as a council workman to trick his way into Mrs Dries-Jenkins's home.

He then cruelly tortured the pensioner to force her to reveal her bank card number before grabbing her by the neck and bludgeoning her around her head with a blunt object.

The spread of the blood in the dining room where the attack took place showed the ferocity of the attack dished out to Mrs Dries-Jenkins, the prosecution said.

The court heard that on the day of Mrs Dries-Jenkins's murder and on following days Mason used her card to take money from her bank account.

He was due to marry his girlfriend Denise Evans and had moved their wedding forward to June 10th - nine days after Mrs Dries-Jenkins's savage murder.

Mason, who lived on £100 benefits a fortnight, boot himself a new pair of boots and had himself measured up for a wedding ring at Argos in preparation for the big day.

But he was traced and arrested for murder within a week and the planned wedding never took place.

Jailing Mason for life with a minimum tariff of 30 years today, Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the attack on Mrs Dries-Jenkins as a 'brutal and heartless murder'.

He said: 'You killed a kind and gentle woman in her own home, and you did it so you could steal her money.

'In the hours and days that followed, you spent her money and went about your business as if you had no care in the world.

'By any standards, this was a despicable crime.

'The consequences of your crime have been far-reaching. Mrs Dries-Jenkins is dead and her family has suffered, and will continue to suffer.'

'You must realise Mr Mason that there is a very real likelihood that you will spend the rest of your life in prison.'

Scene of the crime: Police and forensics officers at the house where Mrs Dries-Jenkins was found murdered in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, west Wales

After the verdict today, the jury heard that Mason had a long history of violence and was effectively a career criminal.

At the time of the murder he was already electronically tagged and under curfew for threatening to kill his fiancee.

A drunken Mason had also threatened to 'cut the throat' of her 11-year-old grandson during a blazing row at her home in Narberth.

Police were called to the scene in March last year to find Mason passed out and part of the house doused in petrol and a lighter nearby.

He was dealt with by an order to carry out unpaid community work and received two separate cautions.

But within months Mason had tricked his way into Mrs Dries-Jenkins's home to murder her.

The peaceful, yoga-loving pensioner suffered a merciless attack at his hands which lasted at least five minutes.

Prosecuting, Patrick Harrington QC said: 'Angelika Dries-Jenkins was tortured and murdered in her own home.

'Her killer was John Mason - his reason for killing her was for money.

'After conning his way into her house by wearing a fluorescent jacket posing as a workman, he tortured his victim so she would reveal her pin number.

'He then beat her savagely to death using a blunt item.

'Being the coward that he is, Mason attacked her in the most vulnerable part of her body - her head.

'An already bleeding victim Mrs Dries-Jenkins was then repeatedly struck and the spread of blood shows the ferocity of which she was hit.

'There is also evidence of injury to the throat where he grabbed her during this murderous attack.'

Grim discovery: The daughter of Angelika Dries-Jenkins, Eleanor, right, who found her mother dead after paying her a surprise visit

The victim’s horrified daughter discovered her mother’s disfigured body two days later when she made a surprise visit. Mr Harrington said: 'Her daughter chose to pay her mother a surprise visit.

'She had just come back from her holiday in Italy and wanted to surprise her, two days before her birthday.

'But instead of this joyous occasion, Eleanor made the grim discovery of her mother’s body having been left bludgeoned to death by John Mason.

'She suffered extensive head injuries and there was blood everywhere in the dining room of her home.'

Mason had insisted from the outset that he was innocent of murder and that overwhelming evidence pointing to him as the killer was 'just coincidence'.

The jury rejected that version of events in less than two hours today.

The verdict was immediately welcomed by Dyfed Powys Police.

Detective Superintendent Pam Kelly said: 'Angelica Dries-Jenkins was tortured for the Pin number of her bank account, she was murdered, her car stolen and her bank account emptied, but that was not enough for John Mason.

'He has put Angelica’s family through a three-week murder trial, he has lied from start to finish and shown no remorse whatsoever.

'Today’s verdict is welcomed, it reflects the strength of Angelica’s family and is a credit to the members of the community who have come forward as witnesses.

'This has been achieved through the dedication of the prosecution team, in particular a small group of local detectives from Pembrokeshire who have shown great dedication and tenacity in bringing John Mason to justice.'

Detective Sergeant Paul Callard said: 'This was a complex investigation, which included all facets of forensic and conventional policing techniques. Our small team worked diligently to bring Mason to justice and we are pleased with the verdict.'

A keen gardener, Mrs Dries-Jenkins was born in Germany and settled in Pembrokeshire after marrying a local man thirty years ago.

She had three children including a son Benedict, 32, and two daughters.

Although divorced, Mrs Dries-Jenkins’ former husband Daniel Jenkins was in the public gallery to hear the details of how she died.
