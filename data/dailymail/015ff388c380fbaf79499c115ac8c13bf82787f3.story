An incredible video shows two tiny autonomous drone quadrocopters throwing and catching a pendulum by its narrow end.

Dario Brescianini, a student at ETH Zurich’s Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, developed the complex algorithms which allow the robot quadrocopters to juggle the inverted pendulum.

The video shows one incredibly balancing the pendulum on its end as it buzzes around a lab space, then throwing it up into the air to be caught by the other.

Too cool for school: Dario Brescianini, a student at ETH 
Zurich’s Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, developed the 
complex algorithms which allow the robot quadrocopters to juggle the 
inverted pendulum

Instructing the robotic quadrocopters to perform the amazing feat required complex mathematical modelling and a learning algorithm to account for any errors in the model.

The researchers modified the quadrocopters themselves by fixing a 12cm plate that could hold the pendulum while balancing, and they also developed shock absorbers to add at the pendulum’s tips.

The video they made to showcase their work has proved a hit on YouTube, attracting around 300,000 views and nearly 5,000 'thumbs up' in the two days since Mr Brescianini uploaded it.

To achieve the aerobatic feat with the robot drones, Mr Brescianini and his colleagues first made a two-dimensional mathematical model to understand what was required for the pendulum to lift off from the quadrocopter and become airborne.

'It showed the ideal trajectory in terms of positions, speeds, and angles the quadrocopter needed to follow to throw a pendulum,' wrote Markus Waibel on the Robohub blog.

'And it offered an insight into the throwing process, including identification of its key design parameters.'

For their next step they had to work out how well this theoretical model matched real life, throwing the pendulum by hand to study its aerodynamic properties and precisely timing the quadrocopters' movements.

Then they tested the process of balancing, throwing, catching and rebalancing the pendulum between the two tiny flying machines do adapt their maths to fit.

Mr Brescianini said: 'This project was very interesting because it combined various areas of current research and many complex questions had to be answered:

'How can the pole be launched off the quadrocopter? Where should it be caught and – more importantly – when? What happens at impact?

'The biggest challenge to get the system running was the catching part. We tried various catching manoeuvres, but none of them worked until we introduced a learning algorithm, which adapts parameters of the catching trajectory to eliminate systematic errors.'

made a two-dimensional mathematical model to understand what was 
required for the pendulum to lift off from the quadrocopter and become 
airborne

A major challenge was the demonstration's highly dynamic nature: the total time between the throw and catch is just over half a second, a very short time to manoeuvre the catching quadrocopters into place.

A second serious challenge the researchers faced was the high cost of failure. Failed catches tended to result in the pendulum crashing into a rotor blade, sending the quadrocopters plummeting to the ground.

'A crashed quadrocopter not only entailed repairs, but also meant recalibration of the vehicle to re-determine its operating parameters and restarting the learning algorithms,' the Robohub blog reported.

Markus Hehn, a PhD student at ETH Zurich who supervised Mr Brescianini's project, told Robohub: 'This was a really fun project to work on.

'We started off with some back-of-the-envelope calculations, wondering whether it would even be physically possible to throw and catch a pendulum.

'This told us that achieving this manoeuvre would really push the dynamic capabilities of the system.

'As it turned out, it is probably the most challenging task we’ve had our quadrocopters do.

'With significantly less than one second to measure the pendulum flight and get the catching vehicle in place, it’s the combination of mathematical models with real-time trajectory generation, optimal control, and learning from previous iterations that allowed us to implement this.'
