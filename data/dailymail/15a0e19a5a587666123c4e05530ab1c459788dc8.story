The jobless stars of a new Channel 4 documentary claim they have been the victims of a 'manipulative' stitch-up.

Benefits Street features the lives of locals living in James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham.

90 per 
cent of residents living in the 137-house street claim one or more 
benefits ranging from £500-£900 a month in free hand-outs.

But those featured in the show, including Mark Thomas and Becky Howe, are less than impressed with the way they have been portrayed

Not impressed: Mark Thomas, 23 and Becky Howe, 23, say producers of Channel 4's Benefits Street have made residents look like 'slums'

The pair, both 23, who pick up £750-a-month in child tax credits, child benefits and job seekers allowance, say they have been disowned by their family because of the show.

They live with their two-year-old daughter Casey and son Callum, four.

Ms Howe said: 'They've just tried to make us look like slums. Everyone on the street is fuming about it.

'Our faces are everywhere. Half of my family and friends have 
already disowned me because of it - I've had to take them off Facebook. Some want me to change my name on Deed Poll.

'We
 might be on benefits but everyone has got to start somewhere. When 
people have said nasty things on Facebook, I've just said "Well how were
 you brought up?"

'We're going to be put in the same group as all benefit claimers.

Claimer: Another 'star' of the show Polish mum-of-two Anna Korzen, 28, claims £900-a-month in tax credits, says she needs the money to support her children

'There's been so much recently about people being on benefits and we don't want to be caught up in all that.

Partner Mr Thomas added: 'They've put 
smack bang in the middle of the description words like 'drugs' and 
'alcohol' - God knows where they got that from.

'I'm on benefits at the moment but that's because I'm training to be a security guard.

'They want to make us look uneducated - but they don't know what they're talking about because I went to college.'

Bragging: Self confessed alcoholic James Clarke, 44, says he is the 'star of the show'

One nurse, who refused to appear in 
the documentary, said: 'I think they went for vulnerable people, those 
that are less educated or from minority groups who don't speak English 
very well. They manipulated people.

'They
 said they wanted to speak to me. They saw that I am a big, fat black 
lady and thought that I wouldn't be very educated - but I told them no.

'We do have some problems on the street, especially with the Eastern Europeans going through the bins and things like that.

'I think there will be fighting on the street when the show comes out.'

However, other street members are less upset by the show - with one bragging about being its 'star'.

Father-of-three James Clarke, 44, brags about being the 'star of the show' even claiming the title of the series was his idea.

The self-confessed alcoholic, who has lived on the street for four-and-a-half years, openly boasts about pocketing £400-a-month in benefits which he spends on booze.

Mr Clarke, who already has three grandchildren and is known by his nickname of Fungi, said: "Ten percent of the street work and 90 percent don't on the street.

'I'm the star of the show. It was my idea to come up with the name.

'At the end of the day it's the truth, we all claim benefits and we're not ashamed to do so. What else can we do? We are all entitled to buy food and have a roof over our heads.

'We call it a family orientated street because if you go to your neighbours they will help you out.

'I get £400 a month but I have to try and pay my gas, electricity and bills. And I have to feed the dog and feed myself. And I'm a heavy drinker, I'm an alcoholic really.

'I can't work because of my health, it's getting worse so I'm waiting for my benefits to go up.

'I don't want them to make us look like d*ck heads. From what I've seen it looks okay but we haven't seen the last three episodes.'

Another of the show's 'stars' is Polish mother-of-two Anna Korzen, 28, who has lived on the street for four years.

She has rakes in £900-a-month in tax credits, child benefits and housing benefits.

She said: 'They just asked about the neighbours and many things that go on.

'There was a big fight here between the bin men and the people two months ago because we haven't got bins in the street so there's too much rubbish.

Response: Producers for the show say it is a 'sympathetic, humane and objective portrayal' of those struggling to cope with austerity

'They also asked me about my interests and my plans for the future.

'I'm looking for work. I trained as a care assistant and have applied for a job in Winson Prison but haven't heard anything back.

'Most of the people on the street live on benefits. Some of them say they are sick and can't work but most are scroungers. I'm not, I need the money to support my children.'

A spokesperson for Channel 4 said: 'The series reveals a community where residents know that, when times 
get tough, they can turn to each other for help.

'It is a sympathetic, humane and objective portrayal of how people are coping with continuing austerity and cuts in benefits.'
