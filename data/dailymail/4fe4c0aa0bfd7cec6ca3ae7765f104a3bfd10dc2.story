A teenage cat owner has been devastated to find her beloved pet brutally murdered, hanging from a tree with one eye missing.

To make matters worse, it’s believed 19-year old Amelia (who wishes not to share her surname), from Morayfield in Queensland’s Moreton Bay region, was taunted by the cat killer, who placed tufts off the cat’s fur around Amelia’s house every day as Amelia searched for her pet.

The RSPCA believe the adored cat, Zeus, was bludgeoned to death with a hammer.

It all began when the Morayfield resident made a creepy discovery when her pet was peculiarly found with a shaved back.

Amelia was distraught when her cat, Zeus, was found hanging from a tree with his eye missing

Amelia and her partner Mark had owned Zeus since he was six-week-old and adored the feline, who she describes as 'happy and playful'

It was just a day after Amelia’s sister-in-law’s cat Theo also turned up mysteriously shaved in their home.

‘We laughed it off when Theo turned up shaved and joked that our cat, Zeus would be next,’ Amelia told Daily Mail Australia.

Amelia told Daily Mail that a man across the street’s cat has also been found with its fur shaved.

The next day, Amelia, her partner Mark and her partner’s sister Lisa came home to find Zeus was gone.

Tufts of fur were found in the house in mysterious locations everyday for the five days Zeus was missing

The day before Zeus went missing, he mysteriously turned up in the family home with his back shaved

‘It was out of character for Zeus to be missing,’ Amelia said.

‘We saw him before we went out one night but came back and he was gone.’

A day after Zeus went missing, Lisa found a clump of her cat’s fur, which appeared to be carefully placed in their house.

‘While my partner’s sister was cooking dinner, she found a clump of Zeus’ fur in the window.’

‘It definitely hadn’t been there before. It just appeared.’

Everyday another large clump of ginger fur was found in a different ominous place, and the family immediately knew something was wrong.

The family found tufts of Zeus' fur around the home, which they believe were placed by the person who took Zeus before he was killed

On the second day, Lisa came out to the sinister sight of cat fur placed in her car’s windscreen wipers.

Three days after Zeus disappeared, fur was found on a toilet paper roll, which was directly under an open window – but there was still no sight of Zeus.

The next day, fur is believed to have been placed whilst Amelia was in the house.

Fur was found on the home phone, which had not been there when the phone was used moments before.

‘We think someone jumped the fence and came through the backyard,’ Amelia told Daily Mail Australia.

‘Myself and Lisa were both in tears when it happened. We didn’t understand how someone could be so disgusting to bring in our cat’s fur while he was missing.’

The RSPCA conducted an autopsy on the cat, in the hope of finding out more about the killer

They put up posters of Zeus, desperate to bring their ‘friendly, playful’ cat back home.

‘One day, we didn’t find any fur at all and I was kind of glad. But then I got a call,’ explains Amelia.

‘I received a call from someone saying they’d found a cat matching Zeus’ description.

‘I was excited and asked where he was located.’

Amelia’s worst fears were realised.

‘The person told me that Zeus was up a tree, but he is deceased.’

The RSPCA believe Amelia's beloved cat Zeus was bludgeoned to death with a hammer

Amelia’s boyfriend Mark immediately knew something was drastically wrong when he saw her face.

Mark ran out of the house first, with Lisa and Amelia behind me, to find out if the awful news was true.

‘I was last to get there but the first thing I saw my partner’s sister crying and I knew it was true.

‘I saw my cat, basically hanging in the tree and he was missing an eye.

‘It was a massive shock, I couldn’t stop crying. My partner told me to go home.’

The cat was high up in the tree and had to be cut out.

Zeus was buried by the family, and to their horror they found another tuft of ginger hair placed in their house the next day.

The family is devastated and have locked up their home, terrified more harm will come to their other pets

‘We were kind of worried that if the person watched us bury him, that they might dig him back up.’

The RSPCA conducted an autopsy on the cat and are waiting on more results, having sent more samples to America, according to Amelia.

RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the incident is disturbing, particularly the ‘game’ that tauned the cat owners, and confirmed the cat was killed from a strike to the head.

The RSPCA is looking for more information about who conducted the heinous killing.

"They could face charges of animal cruelty, whether or not they would be in the extreme end, probably not, depending on the circumstances,’ Mr Beatty told Courier Mail.

Two other cats in the street have also been found shaved, which happened to Zeus before he disappeared

Cat owners in the street have been advised to keep their animals in doors.

‘We shouldn’t have to keep our cats inside but you kind of have to,’ Amelia said.

‘We also have two dogs and they are stuck inside now. We’ve locked the back door.’

Amelia says she also feels like her own safety and wellbeing in compromised.

‘Everytime we hear something in the middle of the night, we get scared.’

'It was heartbreaking to see him hanging from that tree.' 

Amelia and her family are having trouble sleeping and feel their own safety is compromised
