It's the word that no-one wants to hear - and a diagnosis which changes your life in seconds. But the reality is that half of all Australian men and a third of women will be affected by cancer by the age of 84.

In 2014, more than 128,000 Australians are expected to be diagnosed with cancer. For every one of those people, there is a network of partners, friends and family who hope to support the patient as best as they can.

At what is a confusing and overwhelming time, medical oncologist Dr RANJANA SRIVASTAVA's new book So It's Cancer: Now What? is designed to guide people through the battle of their lives.

She uses the experiences of those who have gone through cancer to give tips and advice that may not have even occurred to the sufferer, but could make all the difference.

Here, she offers advice to patients, family and friends who are dealing with the shock of a cancer diagnosis.

Dr Ranjana Srivastava has written a book to help assist cancer patients and their loved ones, right from the moment of diagnosis

If you are the patient…

Avoid panicking although this is easier said than done. The very mention of cancer inspires fear but these days, many early cancers have a very good prognosis, allowing patients to lead a normal life after adequate treatment.

For example, breast cancers detected via screening mammogram are typically small and operable. There is a swirling debate about prostate cancer screening because it is thought that many patients, especially older men, die with prostate cancer rather than of it. Bowel cancer screening has led to a reduction in deaths.

In turn, many non-malignant conditions such as severe heart failure, kidney disease or end-stage emphysema have a poorer prognosis than cancer. Cancer survival rates continue to improve and a person diagnosed today has a better than ever chance of survival. Sixty-five per cent of cancer patients can expect to survive for the next five years, with the survival rate having risen by an impressive thirty per cent in the past two decades. 

Renew your relationship with your GP or find one. 

A cancer patient may meet several kinds of doctors including a GP, medical oncologist, surgeon and radiation oncologist. Of these, the relationship with the first two is often the longest for many patients.

A good GP with whom you share a rapport and understanding can be the lynchpin of your medical journey. He or she can refer you to capable and considerate specialists, organize tests and serve as a valuable sounding board.  

Your GP, another specialist or the hospital system will usually refer you to an oncologist.

The tips in the book hope to make cancer sufferers feel less overwhelmed when dealing with their diagnosis and treatment

Take time to find a suitable oncologist and take the trouble to understand your diagnosis and its implications.  

Cancer does not develop in a single day or a week – it is typically something that grows over months.

Hence, avoid the natural instinct to seek next-day treatment, knowing that in most instances, it’s okay and indeed, important, to order your thoughts, make a list of priorities, and find the right doctor for you.

It is vital that you feel able to talk to your oncologist because cancer treatment is complicated but also nuanced.

A mutual feeling of respect and understanding are important considerations as is empathy. It pays to heed word-of-mouth recommendations. It’s also a good idea to think about what kind of doctor suits your needs.

Some patients are content with an oncologist who can give them straight medical advice and they seek emotional support elsewhere.

Other patients want their oncologist to offer more holistic care. Some patients are quite comfortable with the oncologist making all the decisions while others prefer a collaborative approach.

Don’t feel disadvantaged by a perceived lack of education or sophistication to engage with a specialist. Part of a doctor’s job is to demystify medicine and bring you along. This means speaking to you in a language that you can understand.

Expect plain-language and honest explanations to your questions and ask for information in writing where possible so you can read it in your own time. The flip side of demanding honesty is that you must be prepared for bad news from time to time, but as long as this is addressed in a helpful and considered manner, you are usually better off learning the bad news.

Dr Srivastava tells cancer patients to ask their doctor to give a written version of any information, so the patient can go home and read it again in their own time

If you are the spouse or partner of a cancer patient…

Cancer doesn’t just affect the individual but also the family. Partners can suffer no less acutely as they try to help the patient while managing their own emotions.

Allow the patient some space to reconcile to the shock of the diagnosis. Even people who usually share everything can become withdrawn, leading partners to feel frustrated that they are being shut out. From the patient’s perspective there is the struggle to make sense of the upheaval and the obligation to shield loved ones from worry.

If you are feeling left out, urge yourself to practice patience and understanding. Make known that you are available but also be respectful of personal space.

Cancer patients quickly become disempowered as they enter the healthcare maze. Everyone tells them what to do and when to do it. The greatest gift you can give your partner is your quiet support and a ready ear.

Dr Srisvastava's new book is a guide to the fight of your life

When you are a friend of a cancer patient…

Even though you’re desperate to help it isn’t uncommon, especially in the early stages, to feel as if your help is not welcome or that you are being intrusive. Sadly, many friendships fall victim to cancer because of mismatched expectations and often, the sheer practicality of trying to keep relationships alive when you are in the battle of your life.

Not everyone wants to share bad or confronting news with others. Some patients don’t want to be perceived as needy while others are merely protective of their friends. People feel ready to talk at different junctures of an illness. And frankly, many patients are simply too exhausted to analyse these things too much.

Something many patients have told me is that they find it tiring, and even disheartening, to be constantly asked by good friends if there is anything they can do. Many patients prefer that their friend took stock of what they need and just did it.

Small and regular acts of kindness and consideration matter far more than a large burst of generosity followed by awkward silence. Join a roster for preparing meals, fold the laundry, pick up a patient’s children from school, mow the lawns – these routines don’t stop when someone has cancer and a good friend will rearrange commitments to take care of the boring stuff.

A potent theme for cancer patients is abandonment so don’t underestimate the value of just being there even if you feel you are not doing anything important. Offer to drive the patient to an appointment or simply sit next to the chemotherapy chair.

Cancer is typically a drawn-out experience with several ups and downs. With modern medicine, the future appears optimistic. If you are a patient take heart from this. If you are a concerned partner, your supportive presence could be the greatest gift. If you are a worried friend, recognize the value of small, seemingly insignificant acts of kindness that are anything but.
