Champagne and gin have overtaken sherry and brandy as our preferred tipples at Christmas, a study suggests.

Researchers analysed conversations of today and compared them with those of the 1990s, to reveal how our food and drink preferences have changed.

They looked at thousands of recorded exchanges from the 1990s which showed we would rather pep up our festivities with champagne, gin or vodka than sherry and liqueur.

It showed  that we are also less likely to make traditional Christmas food like Yorkshire puddings.

According to recent records, we have resorted to ordering takeout curry and pizza rather than making festive holiday dinner favourites like custard.

And it won't surprise you that compared to the 1990s, we talk about calories twice as much as we used to.

Words don't necessarily always translate to actions as our most talked about food item at Christmas - as well as the rest of the year - is cake.

Initial findings from the study revealed tea is our nation's favourite drink, spoken an average of 255 times per million words.

Yet when it comes to choosing between a cup of coffee and a glass of wine, alcohol is more important to us Brits.

The study shows we talk about family almost twice as much as we used to, as it seems that the concept of family is more noticeable in British English speech today than it was two decades ago.

Dr Claire Dembry, Senior Language Research Manager at Cambridge University Press, said: 'This analysis presents an interesting insight into how our use of language has changed over time.

'Our tastes in food and drink have certainly changed, but our interest in the family seems to be ever increasing.

'Coupled with the finding that we are also significantly less self-centred in our speech than we used to be, with a reduction in frequency of words associated with self - we say "I" or "me" 47 per cent less than we used to .

'This suggests Christmas may be even happier this year - but perhaps this can be attributed to all the talk of champagne!'

The team at the University of Lancaster are looking for people to send in their everyday conversations for a fee to aid the study further.

Professor Tony McEnery, from the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Sciences (CASS) at Lancaster University, said: 'We need to gather hundreds, if not thousands, of conversations to create a full spoken corpus, so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years.

'This is an ambitious project and we are calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday, informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help our team to delve deeper into spoken language and to shed more light on the way our spoken language changes over time.'
