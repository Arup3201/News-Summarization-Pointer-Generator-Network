The three American hikers who were imprisoned for more than a year after accidentally crossing into Iran are telling their side of a the story in new book 'A Sliver of Light'.

Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal wrote about the holiday they took to Kurdistan in 2009 that quickly turned into a nightmare when a guide led them astray.

The guide mistakenly led them into Iran, and the three college-friends were arrested. The two men spent more than two years in prison while Shourd spent most of her year behind bars in solitary confinement.

Shourd became severely depressed during her imprisonment, but there were a few periods of unexpected joy.

Like the time Bauer proposed to Shourd, his girlfriend, using strings he pulled rom a towel fastened with a staple.

In the prison yard one day, Bauer pulled her away from the surveillance cameras to pop the question.

'Baby, I didn't want to do this here,' he said. I wanted it to be somewhere beautiful, but...will you marry me?'

Following their release, Shourd and Bauer were married in May 2012. They also share another fond memory from their period of imprisonment.

One night, while being housed next to each other, Bauer snuck out of his cell to have sex with his girlfriend but Shourd initially protested.

'if you're caught they'll separate us, Shane. We'll lose everything,' she said.

'Please, Baby, let me do this. I need to see you,' Bauer responded.

The two were never caught, but in the confusion of sneaking back to his own cell, Bauer mistakenly took Shourd's pants instead of his own.

The next day, Shourd saw her boyfriend in the prison yard and laughed out loud when she noticed his mistake.

But Shourd and Bauer's romantic moments were rare exceptions in the long period of a distressing confinement.

Life got even worse when the trio were transferred to Evin, the Tehran prison notorious for holding political prisoners.

At one point, the two men were terrorized by a guard they nicknamed 'AK'.

AK initially threw Fattal, blindfolded, down a set of stairs before putting Bauer in a headlock and throwing him against the wall.

Shourd was released after a year while her friends were kept behind bars for an additional year. Above, a rally for the hikers outside the United Nations in July 2011

After a year behind bars, Shourd was released for a 'medical condition' and she joined the many on the outside championing for her friends' release.

At a dinner with Sean Penn and then-girlfriend Scartlett Johanssen, Shourd got the actor to promise to ask Hugo Chavez about her friends' wrongful imprisonment.

Chavez, the then-president of Venezuela was personal friends with Iran's then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

In the end, the hikers were convicted of illegal entry and espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison.

But Bauer and Fattal were released in September 2011 after Omani officials posted $500,000 bail.
