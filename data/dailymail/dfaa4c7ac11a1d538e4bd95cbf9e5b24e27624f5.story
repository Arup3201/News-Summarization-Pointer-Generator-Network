Newcastle boss Alan Pardew admits teams have to be pushing for the Champions League if they are to retain their best players.

The Magpies have lost France internationals Yohan Cabaye and Mathieu Debuchy to Paris St Germain and Arsenal respectively since the turn of the year with both clubs able to offer them European football.

However, Pardew is hopeful that the additions of the likes of Daryl Janmaat, Siem de Jong, Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere will allow the club to compete for a top-four finish once again.

He told BBC Radio Newcastle: ‘If you don't make the Champions League, then the big teams come for your players - look at Southampton.

‘We are pushing every year to try and build to hopefully get to a stage where we make it without losing our players.

‘We have pitched in and signed players that we think give us a chance to push for Champions League.

‘We have already shown we are much better covered offensively than we were after Yohan Cabaye's departure.

‘We have options, more options to come in and it is going to strengthen my hand to tactically change the team.’
