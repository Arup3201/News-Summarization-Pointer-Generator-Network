If you’re hoping for the halcyon days of gaming to be given a virtual reality reboot, look no further than Oculus Rift.

The headset, which continues to seemingly lead the way in the fight for the emerging VR market, has been used to take a fresh look at Sonic the Hedgehog.

And now, in this rather stomach-churning video, you can experience all the loops, jumps and speed of Sonic in glorious first-person.

Youtube user Chadtronic has unveiled his first-person Sonic the Hedgehog game that utilises the virtual reality Oculus Rift device. In the game the player can look around in the virtual world using the headset while moving with a controller, with the experience likened to riding a rollercoaster

The game uses something known as Sonic GDK.

This is a collection of source code that makes it possible for fan-created Sonic games to be designed.

The ones in this video were made using the Unreal Engine 3.

‘This is one of those games where if you kind of get woozy on those rollercoasters in theme parks I recommend you probably stay away from this one,’ YouTube user Chadtronic said in his video.

‘But besides that it’s extremely fun.’

In the video, the gamer is shown using the headset to ‘look around’ as they play.

This
 enables them to move towards obstacles, loops and jumps while using a 
controller to input commands. Sonic is known for his speed and quick 
movements, as well as his iconic look.

Using the Rift will therefore give gamers the opportunity to see life through the eyes of Sega’s mascot.

might not enjoy the experience too much. Here Sonic begins a roll into a ball before diving down a hill in a particular butterflies-in-the-stomach moment

Facebook's virtual world was given the go ahead earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

Oculus was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

The firm is developing the leading VR headset - with a developer version on sale for $350 (£210)

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate.'

But virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who have already unveiled their own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.

The video is just one of a number of innovative ways Oculus has been employed.

Swedish broadband provider Ume.net recently unveiled its intriguing experiment.

They programmed the headset to experience internet lag in real life, to give users an idea of what it would be like to live in a world where things buffer like an online video.

The experiment is called 'Living with lag' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an Oculus Rift together with a Rasperry Pi, webcam and noise-cancelling headphones.

Together, this combination can simulate different levels of lag, from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds.

The results are rather hilariously shown in their video, which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis.
