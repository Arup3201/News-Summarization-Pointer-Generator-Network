A teenage model has to be extremely careful in the sun - as she suffers from a condition that means she can burn even if she's exposed to low-energy lightbulbs.

Mia Galloway is battling lupus, an incurable autoimmune condition that makes her skin super-sensitive to light.

Mia, 15, can develop a very severe form of sunburn within minutes if she’s out in daylight.

She was a contestant in a teen beauty pageant, and was modelling and winning parts in hit television shows including Waterloo Road until she became ill last Easter.

Former beauty queen Mia Galloway was diagnosed with lupus last Easter. She says she is determined to live a normal life despite having to take a

The teenager, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was quickly diagnosed with lupus which causes the immune system to attack vital organs. She was kept in the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital for three weeks and had chemotherapy to suppress her immune system.

Mia now takes daily chemotherapy tablets and receives regular blood tests. As she has a suppressed immune system it means a common cold could develop into pneumonia. However, she believes she 
is one of the lucky ones, because her condition was diagnosed within 
days - in some cases it can take seven years to recognise the illness.

The straight-A student who hopes to become a lawyer, said: 'I want people to be aware of the condition, because it could save someone’s life.'

Her school has been fundraising for the charity Lupus UK, and a representative from the society spoke about the condition in a special assembly.

Mia and mother Tammy Galloway
who said of her daughter: 'She is an inspiration, she is so positive'

Mia, who has a sister Lucinda, aged six, and a brother Wesley, 28, said: 'I have good days and bad days.

'The aim is to be able to go to the hospital once every three months. At the moment, I am going every two weeks.'

Lupus is an autoimmune condition that affects one in 20,000 people. It most commonly affects young women.

It is a complex and poorly understood condition but occurs when the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, tissue and organs.

It causes three main symptoms - fatigue, joint pain and skin rashes. The severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person. People can experience a mild form of the condition with 'flare-ups'.

There is currently no cure but there are a number of treatments to help manage the symptoms.

She added: 'My friend said I don’t take my illness seriously, but I have not changed.

'I have not got upset by the condition, maybe because it has not sunk in yet. I am still the same person and I want to live a normal life.'

Thanks to the Little Princess Trust, Mia has a wig and uses camouflage make-up for her skin.Now the teenager wants to study hair and media make-up at Bolton College to help others who have skin conditions.

She already supports the charity Seed of Sight team, Guide Dogs for the Blind and Vision 2020, having raised money for them.

Her mother, Tammy Galloway, aged 38, first took Mia to hospital because she kept being sick.

Mia was originally told that she may be dehydrated, but one of the doctors, Dr Fiona Watson, spotted the symptoms.

Mrs Galloway, who is married to John, aged 48, said: 'Dr Watson saved Mia’s life. The condition was attacking Mia’s kidneys and she was one stage away from kidney failure.'

She added: 'She is an inspiration, she is so positive. She was asked by a friend if she had one wish what would it be, and she did not wish for the illness to go away. She said ‘it is who I am’.'

Mrs Galloway works for BOC, which is fundraising for Lupus UK.
