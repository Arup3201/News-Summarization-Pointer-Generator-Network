When a tourist approached the bars of the orangutan cage at a zoo in the Philippines to get a closer look, he didn't expect to lose his shirt.

He got more than he bargained for when the cheeky animal made a grab for his clothing, tugged it off his back and eventually worked out how to put the T-shirt on himself.

In a hilarious clip posted on YouTube, the tourist is seen involved in a desperate tug of war with the orangutan, called Carlo, as he tries to maintain his dignity and stay fully clothed.

Cheeky: Carlo the orangutan tugs at the tourist's shirt as he tries to steal it in a hilarious YouTube clip

Tug of war: The tourist attempts to fight back and keep hold of his T-shirt

Admitting defeat: The tourist realises that he is not going to overpower Carlo and surrenders his shirt to the animal

A woman is seen laughing as she attempts to bat the animal's hand away, but her attempts to help her friend are in vain.

Much to the Carlo's delight, the tourist gives up the garment and makes a hasty retreat leaving the beast to run around his cage clutching his prized T-shirt and holding it aloft for all to see.

In his attempts to mock the tourist, the clever orangutan attempts to put the T-shirt over his head, but a little confused, he only succeeds in putting it over his head and obscuring his vision.

Wearing the shirt like a headscarf, Carlo bounds around the cage before considering another attempt at putting it on properly.

Playful: Carlo tries to put the T-shirt on but ends up wearing it like a headscarf as he runs around his enclosure

Mimic: The primate holds the shirt aloft and sizes it up as he considers another attempt at dressing himself like a human

Much to the amusement of bystanders at the Davao Crocodile Park, the primate's second attempt to dress himself is more successful than the first.

Although the shirt is inside out and he only manages to put one arm into its sleeve, the ape mimics us humans and delightedly struts around his cage.Â 

It is hardly surprising that Carlo manages to work out how to put on the shirt - orangutans are regarded as the most intelligent of the primates.

They are known for being able to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools and make up elaborate nests to sleep in.

Experts have extensively studied the species for their learning capability.
