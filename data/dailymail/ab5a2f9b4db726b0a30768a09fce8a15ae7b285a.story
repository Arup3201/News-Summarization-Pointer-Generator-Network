A former Lord Chancellor has criticised police for ‘inappropriately’ misusing controversial anti-terror powers to spy on journalists.

Lord Falconer lashed out at police chiefs who defended the dubious practice of using snooping legislation to identify reporters’ sources.

He clashed with Andy Trotter, ex-chief constable of British Transport Police, who insisted there were ‘higher concerns’ than protecting whistleblowers who spoke to the media.

Mr Trotter, until recently the media lead at the Association of Chief Police Officers, said constabularies had used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) ‘entirely properly’.

The row deepened after it emerged two police forces used the powers to obtain phone records from the Sun and Mail on Sunday journalists to work out who they were speaking to, in once case sidestepping a judge’s agreement to protect a confidential source.

Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into how the powers are being used amid widespread concerns officers are bypassing legal protections.

The surveillance watchdog, Sir Paul Kennedy, is also holding a ‘full inquiry’ into officers potentially misusing Ripa by ordering telecommunications companies to hand over call logs belonging to newspapers.

The powers require only that a request be approved by a police officer of Superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants.

It is claimed officers used Ripa because other laws governing investigations require officers to go before a judge to make the case for seizing journalistic material.

Lord Falconer, a member of the Labour Government which brought the powers, said the review by Sir Paul, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, should state that when identification of journalistic sources was an issue, police must seek the permission of the courts.

It has emerged that the police secretly obtained phone records of a Mail on Sunday reporter while they were preparing a prosecution against former Liberal Democrat government minister Chris Huhne, pictured 

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘There are provisions in other legislation which say where there’s an issue about identifying a journalistic source, the application for that material should go before a judge so the judge can balance the public interest in making sure there’s a proper investigation against a need to protect journalistic sources.

‘Going and using Ripa involves no such balance - the police can authorise it themselves so nobody ever considers the balance of, for example, protecting sources.’

Lord Falconer said that neither case involved any ‘degree of urgency’ by the police and in one of the cases the judge had taken ‘great steps’ to ensure the identity of a source was concealed.

He said: ‘It does look this is not a proper use of the powers.’

He accepted proper safeguards should have been included to protect journalists and their sources when Ripa was first introduced in 2000.

But Mr Trotter said he believed police had been using the legislation ‘entirely properly when you look at the seriousness of the cases they were dealing with.’

He said: ‘It’s about dealing with serious crime that the police forces were in this particular case using the legislation properly and making sure that all the evidence available comes out for victims and for the accused to make sure that nothing is secret, nothing is kept away from the judicial process.

‘Whilst I totally respect the need for journalists to protect their sources and their informants but there are other higher needs for justice to make sure all information comes out, it shouldn’t be secret, it shouldn’t be hidden away.’

Last month it emerged the Metropolitan Police used Ripa powers to obtain telephone records from The Sun newspaper’s newsdesk and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn as part of the Plebgate inquiry.

The records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims Andrew Mitchell, the then chief whip, described officers as ‘plebs’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of Downing Street.

Then, last week, it emerged police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the Mail on Sunday – the Daily Mail’s sister paper – and one of his sources for the story, even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential.

Kent Police also used Ripa to find out who spoke to David Dillon, the Mail on Sunday news editor working on the story, and his source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who was given the story by Constance Briscoe.

Police and the security sources obtained communications records under Ripa more than 514,000 times last year, nearly 10,000 a week.
