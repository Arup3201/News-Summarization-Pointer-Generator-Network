An Alabama man has been arrested in connection with a video appearing to show a college football fan inflicting a horrifying sexual assault on a rival supporter after he passed out in a fast food restaurant following the game.

Brian Downing, 32, of Smiths Station, Alabama, was booked on charges of sexual battery and obscenity.

He was videotaped on January 9 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face. The LSU fan appears to be heavily inebriated and practically unconscious,' a police statement said.

The footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel 
BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the 
Internet.

Police said sex crimes detectives met
Downing at his attorney's office in New Orleans, where officers 
arrested him.

Downing looked at the ground as officers escorted him in 
handcuffs into the jail. Neither he nor the officers answered questions.

Police said LSU and Alabama University campus police helped them collect 
information and evidence needed to get a warrant for Downing's arrest.

Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Ala., Sheriff Heath 
Taylor who turned him in.

Taylor said that when he heard the allegation from his family that he had no choice but to 
arrest Downing or send him to New Orleans.

'I wasn't going to let 
anybody say that because he's my family I wasn't doing anything about 
it.

Mr Taylor said, he called Downing's dad 
and told him to bring him to the sheriff's office in Phenix City, Ala.

It wasn't a hard decision, he said. 'You've just got to do the right thing.'

Downing's actions were videotaped about 11:45 p.m. Jan. 9, at a restaurant on Bourbon Street, police said.

A video taken on a camera phone 
showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the 
Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed 
out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January 9.

The
footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel 
BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the 
Internet. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing 
his genitals repeatedly in his face.

The alleged sexual assault happened 
following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship 
Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0.

The clip, which lasts for five 
minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons 
on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures 
on their camera phones.

One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.'

The hazing continues with rival fans 
sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football 
chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have 
gathered.

Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.'

The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious.

It is then that a rival fan, dressed 
in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of
his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face.

Scott Myers, a spokesman for Birmingham, Ala.-based Hibbett Sports Inc.,
confirmed Thursday that the company fired Downing on Wednesday because 
of his part in the video.

He said the company had been aware of the tape but did not identify the 
person on it until Wednesday. He refused to say what the man did for 
Hibbett or how the company became aware of his alleged involvement. 
Hibbett Sports lists about 800 stores in 26 states.

'We were made aware of this situation late yesterday afternoon. We 
conducted our own investigation, and after the investigation was 
concluded, we made the determination to terminate his employment,' Myers
said.

Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen
Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the 
video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both 
have deleted their Facebook profiles.

The
recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's 
sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it 
was their director's 22-year-old son.

Remi Braden, director of public 
affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were 
alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary 
investigation. 

'No one in the restaurant where the 
incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. 
Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position
to release more information at this time.'

The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state.

However Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case.

He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify.

'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior. 

'That perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward.  Given this challenge, a prosecutor’s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case.'

Professor Simmons teaches criminal law at Ohio State. Prior to becoming a law professor, he was an assistant district attorney for New York County.
