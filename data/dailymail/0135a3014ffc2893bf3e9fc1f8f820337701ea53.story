While many gamers will be busily completing missions in Grand Theft Auto V as quickly as possible, one small group of fans has made a time-lapse video to showcase the lifelike graphics of the new game.

The three-and-a-half minute video takes viewers on a tour of fictional San Andreas state and captures some of the tiny details that make the video game world seem so realistic.

The video was created by the people behind YouTube's popular 'THE DESPICABLE CHANNEL' and took them a whole day to put together sequences of varied scenes in the game.

While many gamers will be busily completing missions in Grand Theft Auto V as quickly as possible, one small group of fans has made an time-lapse video to showcase the lifelike graphics of the new game. In this image the leaves of trees and cables move to denote a breezy landscape

In what could be seen as a homage to the game's developers, Rockstar, the time-lapse video, while obviously computer-generated, does not seem too strange or artificial thanks to the inclusion of details such as window reflections and people leaving footsteps in sand, PetaPixel said.

The video allows viewers to spot details built into the game, such as different cars stopping at traffic lights in varied positions and different people loitering in front of shops.

The wind moves trees and cables in a natural-looking way, while changes in sunlight alter the reflections on office windows.

Waves lap rocks in a rhythmic but idiosyncratic way seen in real-life and changing weather systems and believable clouds also immerse the viewers in the computerised world.

This is particularly impressive seeing as the game was shot using an XBox 360 with graphics hardware that is now around eight-years-old.

Grand Theft Auto V was released last month to huge acclaim and exceeded worldwide sales of £500 million shortly after going on sale, its published said.

The game delivered the highest first day retail sales of any 
title sold by Take-Two Interactive Software, the parent company of the 
game's developer Rockstar.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight on 18 September for the launch of the game, which reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market - more than films such as Avatar.Experts estimate it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale, with gamers predicted to snap up some 25 million copies - breaking current records.The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut.

GTA IV has reportedly sold more than 25 million copies since its 2008 release.
