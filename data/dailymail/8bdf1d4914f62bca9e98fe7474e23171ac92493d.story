A gesture-controlled system claims to be the solution to making smart homes commonplace - even if the devices in your house aren't that smart.

Called onecue, the system lets you control your TV, room temperature, lights, blinds and more with the swipe of a hand.

But while it syncs with smart technology like Nest and Philips Hue, it can also let you control standard pieces of technology like televisions and set-top boxes.

An Israeli-based firm has created a smart home system that uses gestures. Called onecue it can sync with existing smart devices like Nest, but it can also be used to control infrared devices like standard TVs. Gestures include closing the palm of your hand to 'air click' and change a TV channel

Developed by Israeli-based company eyeSight, onecue can sync up with many existing smart devices in your home.

For now these include Apple TV, Nest Learning Thermostat and Philips Hue, but more are promised in future.

Infrared (IR) controlled devices such as TVs, cable and satellite boxes, DVD players and games consoles are supported by onecue.

Similar to a universal remote, onecue can ‘learn’ to control most IR remote-controlled devices.

For instance, IR-controlled blinds, power switches or power outlets can be controlled with gestures.

It also supports Wi-Fi controlled devices such as the Nest thermostat and Philips Hue light bulbs.

For best results, the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera’s line of sight. The ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft (1.2 and 4.9 metres).

Once a gesture is detected, onecue communicates with configured devices, and it  communicates directly with IR-controlled devices that are in the same room and in the line of sight.

And, it can also control Wi-Fi and infrared-enabled devices such as standard TVs, set-top boxes, games consoles and more.

The device looks similar to Microsoft's Kinect and works best when it is in the line of sight of the user, so the company suggests using it on a flat surface like a TV.

Using hand tracking and gesture recognition technology, it then translates motions into wireless commands.

For example, closing and reopening a palm in the air - dubbed an ‘air click' - selects a channel on the TV.

Placing a finger to a user's lips mutes the system, while moving a hand up and down can open or close IR-controlled blinds.

An LCD display on the front of onecue shows what devices are currently available, and what controls are available.

Actions can also be pre-programmed, such as having it turn on multiple devices at once with the wave of a hand. 

And the device doesn’t need a TV to operate, as the LCD display can provide adequate information on the devices being operated.

The device (shown) has an adjustable stand, so it can be used on a variety of flat surfaces. For best results, the user should face onecue and position themselves within the camera’s line of sight. The ideal distance for interaction is between four and 16ft (1.2 and 4.9 metres). The £125 ($199) device will go on sale in early 2015

The onecue device looks somewhat similar to Microsoft's Kinect (shown) and also, like the device for Xbox One, uses gestures as a means of control

‘Every device in our homes, from the TV to the games console to the thermostat, has its own control system and remotes, cables or apps for operation, resulting in lots of clutter and fragmentation,’ said Gideon Shmuel, boss of eyeSight.

‘To solve this problem, we developed onecue, a control centre to bring together all of these devices through a natural, easy-to-use interface that leverages our years of experience in gesture recognition technology to let you experience your home through your fingertips.’

And he added that ‘onecue is enabling the Internet of Things right in your home by connecting your devices and making them smarter and easier to use.’

The £125 ($199) device is due to go on sale in early 2015.
