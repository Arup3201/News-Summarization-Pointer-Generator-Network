According to a recently released study, the average American household has access to nearly 200 cable television channels - and most of those households only actually watch fewer than 20 of them.

On Tuesday, Nielsen released its Advertising and Audience report, which found that the average U.S. home had access to 189 cable channels in 2013 - a big jump 2008, when the average household had about 129 channels.

According to Nielsen's study, the average American only watches about 17 of the 189 television channels that they pay for, which has technology analysts concluding that cable customers are getting much less value for their money than they have in the past.

Cable bill: The average American pays for 172 cable television channels that they don't actually watch

'Cable companies keep adding more channels to watch and keep increasing 
the price we pay month after month, yet we still only watch the same 
channels,' technology consultant Jeff Kagan tells Marketwatch.com. 'We pay roughly double this year compared to what we
 paid ten years ago.'

The national average bill for cable customers is about $90 per month - which has nearly doubled since 2003. By 2020, experts estimate that the average cable bill will be more in the neighborhood of $200 per month.

The study concludes that more content - or television channels - doesn't result in increased channel consumption. The numbers should be a sign to advertisers and content creators that quality is crucial because consumers have so many options in terms of what type of programming they view.

Streaming: Many Americans have ditched cable altogether and are replacing it with less expensive video streaming services like Netflix

'This data is significant in that it substantiates the notion that more 
content does not necessarily equate to more channel consumption,' 
Nielsen explains in its report. 'And that means quality is imperative -- for both 
content creators and advertisers. So the best way to reach consumers in a
 world with myriad options is to be the best option.'

This is a crucial time for cable providers, as many former customers have opted to 'cut the cord' and ditch cable TV altogether rather than pay for more than 100 channels they don't watch - many media consumers are now using video streaming services like Netflix and Roku rather than rely on the cable company.

Currently, a subscription to Netflix costs $7.99 per month.
