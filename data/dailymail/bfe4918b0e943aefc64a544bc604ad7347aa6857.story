Just seven months after he left his post at Good Morning America to join the NBC Sports team, Josh Elliott seems to have landed a very big promotion.

A grinning and giddy Elliott joined Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Hoda Kotb this morning as one of the four anchors on Today.

The move comes just one month after his six month non-compete clause with ABC expired.

Elliott was filling in for Natalie Morales, and assumed her news-reading duties throughout the morning.

This is a big move up for Elliott, and something that will likely anger execs over at ABC.

At the time of his departure from the rival network, it was said he would be working with NBC Sports, and would appear on Today only to do sports-related segments.

This morning however, Elliott looked very comfortable filling in, bringing in some of the banter and humor that he used to help GMA topple Today in the ratings race starting back in April of 2012, after the show's 16 year run as the most watched morning news program.

Thrilled: Elliott shared his excitement about hosting the morning news program on Twitter today

The show has continued to struggle in the ratings since then, pulling in just 4.7 million viewers the week of October 13 as opposed to Good Morning America's 5.4 million, this according to TV Newser.

And while America has kept things simple with just four anchors, Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer, George Stephanopoulos, and Amy Robach, along with meteorologist Ginger Zee, on camera during the two hour program, Today now has nine anchors spread out over four hours of television, including Carson Daly, Willie Geist, Kathie Lee Gifford, Tamron Hall and Savanna Guthrie, in addition to Lauer, Roker, Morales and Kotb.

There is no word yet if Elliott will now be a permanent fixture on the show, or will just be stopping by in the absence of Morales. 

Elliott, who is engaged to New York City's ABC news anchor Liz Cho, wanted to get out of his gig at Good Morning America so badly that he reportedly took a pay cut to head over to NBC back on March 30.

TMZ reported that Elliott felt slighted over the $14 million contract Roberts signed to stay on as anchor of the program, as he was only offered an annual salary somewhere between $4 and $5 million.

Permanent gig: It is uncertain in Elliott will now be a regular fixture on Today, or just fill in when Natalie Morales is absent, as she was this morning

He ended up signing a contract for just over $3 million a year to go to NBC, with no promise he would ever be on Today.

The move came just a few months after his good friend Sam Champion also left the program to take a job with The Weather Channel.

Elliott was replaced by Robach while Champion was replaced by Zee.
