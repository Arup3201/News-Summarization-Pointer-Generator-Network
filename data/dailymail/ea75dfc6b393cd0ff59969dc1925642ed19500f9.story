The Muslim convert who attacked four police officers with a hatchet yesterday afternoon was a 'recluse' who kept two sharp axes and a hunting knife at home.

Zale Thompson, 32, was shot dead yesterday after charging at the officers in Queens with a hatchet in his hands. He slashed at one policeman's head, seriously wounding him, and hurt another.

And it has now emerged that Thompson kept even more dangerous weapons at home, converted to radical Islam two years ago, and that even his own family describe him as a 'recluse'.

Weapons: Police searches found a sharpened axe and an ornate hunting knife in Thompson's home. The axe pictured is different to the one used in yesterday's attack

Police searches on Thompson's home in Queens turned up another 'weaponized' hatchet, and a long, wide-bladed hunting knife.

It comes as Police Commissioner William Bratton has branded the attack a 'terrorist act', but said that Thompson did not, in fact, have any clear ties to international extremists.

Following computer examinations for clues about a motive for the assault, police discovered Thompson's  browsing history included organized terror groups, beheadings and the shooting in Canada earlier this week that officials there have called a terrorist attack.

However, the suspect was not on any watch lists, and officials found no indication he sought any training or affiliation to any groups, Mr Bratton said.

Still, the commissioner said he was comfortable calling the incident a terrorist attack, saying: 'This was a terrorist attack, certainly.'

But he stopped short of including the attack in the list of terror plots against the city since September 11, 2001, adding that the investigation was continuing.

According to officers, Thompson was a 'recluse' who spent most of his time in his bedroom. He was described as a 'self-radicalized' Muslim who converted about two years ago.

He had once served in the U.S. Navy and had a history of run-ins with the law over domestic violence in California in 2003 and 2004, police said. 

Investigators believe Thompson was a loner and carried out yesterday's attack without any help - though they are probing potential links to other extremists.

Robert Boyce, the NYPD's Chief of Detectives, outlined the new findings at a conference today.

Without warning: Zale Thompson attacked officers without warning or uttering a single word

Checkpoint: The NYPD were out in force at a subway station near the scene of the attack today

It was also revealed that Thompson has a history of six arrests - in California from 2003-2004, though he has no criminal history in New York.

In the conference today, Boyce also praised the 'exceptional performance of heroic duty' by the officers who took down Thompson.

The entire incident lasted just seven seconds, he said. Surveillance footage showed Thompson charging at officers, swinging his blue-handled hatchet. He was still clinging to the weapon when he was shot dead.

Earlier today social media posts made by Thompson cane to light, in which he called on Muslim extremists to attack America and wage jihad.   

Concern: Authorities worry than more officers or public servants may be attacked in the wake of other strikes

Commenting on a video supporting the rise of an Islamic caliphate - such as ISIS claim to have established in Iraq and Syria - Thompson asked: 'Which is better, to sit around and do nothing, or to Jihad fisabeelallah [for the cause of Allah]!'

Comments from Thompson's Facebook account were also reported on Fox News, who said he posted: 'The solution is to fight. Armed struggle. Simple.'

He then reportedly advocated an armed revolution, saying: 'America's military is strong abroad, but they have never faced an internal mass revolt. … They are weaker at home. We are scattered and decentralized, we can use this as an advantage.

It continued: 'They will not be able to defeat our people if we use guerilla warfare. Attack their weak flanks... If you get wounded who cares. If you die who cares. Eventually they will surrender and then the war will be over.' 

He also spoke of a global conspiracy by 'Zionists and Christians' to suppress Islam. He wrote: 'If the Zionists and the Crusaders had never invaded and colonized the Islamic lands after WW1, then there would be no need for Jihad!'

Posting elsewhere under a music video called 'No white God', he seemed to call for extremists to overthrew European governments and enslave their people.

He wrote: 'They call black people racist for rejecting the oppression they suffered from whites. Listen, when black people have colonized the entire continent of Europe, enslaved its people, and sold them into bondage to foreign lands, then you can call them racist.'

ISIS has continually urged its supporters to launch 'lone wolf' attacks in the West.

Thompson's family, meanwhile, say they are 'shocked' by news of the attack, while neighbors say they would never have connected him with radical Islam.

Social media: Thompson's Facebook profile has a verse of the Qur'an emblazoned across the top, and pictures a man in a balaclava holding weapons

Speaking to ABC7, his grandfather, Ralph Thompson, said only: 'Very shocked, his father not well.'

Igeoma Simon, who lives nearby in Queens, said the Thompson he knew was a 'great guy'.

He said: 'He was very positive. He helped me stay physically active at the park...I don't really know what would drive him to that.' 

Police say they are investigating whether Thompson's attack on the cops was linked to Islamic terrorism. ISIS has urged fighters to launch lone wolf attacks in the United States.

Thompson's Facebook page features a photograph of a man dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a cover photo displaying Arabic writing.

Two attacks in Canada this week by radicalized converts to Islam have killed two Canadian soldiers. 

In one, a man ran down two soldiers in his car in Quebec, killing one, before being shot dead.

On Wednesday a convicted felon ambushed a soldier outside Canadian Parliament, fatally wounding him, before running the Parliament building and opening fire. 

The scene: NYPD officers shot dead a man armed with a hatchet who attacked them Thursday afternoon and critically injured a 29-year-old female bystander in the process

DNA Info reports that on Thursday afternoon a freelance photographer approached the group of rookie cops and asked to take their photograph.

As the officers were posing for the camera, Thompson charged towards them swinging an 18.5 inch hatchet without uttering a single word.

One 24-year-old officer was slashed in the arm.

Another 25-year-old officer, Kenneth Healey, was slashed in the back of head and taken to Jamaica Hospital where he remains in a critical but stabled condition.

A 29-year-old female bystander half a block away from the attack was also critically injured after being shot by an errant police round. She is currently recovering from surgery at Jamaica Hospital and is listed in 'grave' condition.  

The two remaining police shot at Thompson who dropped his hatchet then died at the scene.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he's not ruling out terrorism especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in Canada, reports CNN.

'There is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case. I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,' said Bratton.

CNN reports that Thompson has a criminal record in California and that he was discharged from the U.S. Navy for misconduct. Details of his criminal record and his misconduct are not known at this time. 

His Facebook page says that Thompson graduated from Columbia Teacher's College and that he resides in Queens.

Praise: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hold up a photo of the scene on Thursday and says that the group of recent Police Academy graduates handled the situation as best they could 

CNN reports that New York police were alerted to be on the lookout for random attacks following Thursday's incident. 

DNA Info spoke with witnesses on the scene. 

'We heard pop, pop, pop, pop,' said Rafael, 44, who works at Overseas Travel nearby where the incident occurred.

'She was screaming,"'Help me." She couldn't get up,' said Ericka Babb, a medical assistant at Priority Medical Center in Queens.

'We were way too scared,' said Rafael.

Officers say they shot the hatchet-yielding suspect but it’s not clear how many rounds were fired.

'It was a completely unprovoked attack,' said NYPD Chief Kim Royster, a department spokeswoman.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said during a news conference that all of the police involved are recent graduates of this summer's Police Academy class.

'Three rookie cops, absolutely modest about what happened today and what they did,' de Blasio said.

During the conference Bill De Blasio lauded the officers' training and their fast response to the unprovoked attack.
