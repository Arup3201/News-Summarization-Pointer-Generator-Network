Not everyone was stunned to find Phil Jagielka declared the fastest footballer in the Barclays Premier League.

Leighton Baines claims he’s always known - even before video game developer EA Sports clocked Jagielka sprinting at 35.99km per hour during a game against Leicester in August.

The recording means the 32-year-old Everton and England centre half is officially the fastest player in the Premier League this season, ahead of speed demons such as Raheem Sterling or Andre Schurrle.

Everton centre back Leighton Baines has been declared the fastest player in the Premier League this season 

Jagielka was clocked sprinting at 35.99km per hour making him quicker than Liverpool's Raheem Sterling 

Chelsea's German speedster Andre Schurrle is quick, but not as quick as Jagielka it seems 

But team-mate Baines said: ‘It’s not a surprise to us. We’ve always known that. Football people will always know that. You see it all the time, when someone renowned for being quick is not getting away from someone.

‘I’ve never seen anyone run away from him. He’s a strong and powerful lad. 

'That’s why he’s always been brilliant for Everton and never really got the credit he deserved. I don’t think he is too bothered by that. He likes to come in, do his job and is not interested in plaudits.

Morgan Schneiderlin (right) is another player who is deceptively fast, according to Southampton team-mates

‘We’ve seen him play against some quick players and never seen anyone run away from him. 

'That’s always why we’ve felt secure. Even one-v-one at the back, you feel we’ll be fine. He reads the game really well.

‘Other players will know as well. They will know not to try it. I remember hearing the Southampton lads saying something similar about Morgan Schneiderlin.’
