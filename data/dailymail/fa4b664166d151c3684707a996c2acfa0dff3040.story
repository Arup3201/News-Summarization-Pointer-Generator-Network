Large groups of bats in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are feared to be infected with the deadly white-nose syndrome

Large groups of bats in one of America's most popular national parks appear to have gone crazy after being infected with a deadly disease.

At a time of year when they should be in deep sleep, bats at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, are said to be awake, acting in an odd way and attacking people.

Officials have said it is likely the bats have been infected with white-nose syndrome, a lethal fungus wiping out a variety of bat species throughout the East Coast.

There have been reports of holidaymakers being forced to fight off the bats, while one man was even struck in the forehead in an attack.

Some biologists have even warned the disease could could in fact be a possible extinction event, according to The Washington Post.

Bill Stiver, supervisor of wildlife biologists at the park, said while it was likely to be white-nose syndrome, it should be confirmed during February when the annual census is carried out.

He said: 'Our gut feeling is the disease is starting to manifest itself in the caves.'

Steven Thomas, leader of the National Park Service regional monitoring program, made the discovery while he was in the caves, when he saw a white spot on a bat.

Tests proved it had been infected with the disease, which is thought to have killed between five million and seven million bats since it was first discovered in 2006.

It is feared the disease, which is killing bats up and down the East Coast, could be a possible extinction event

White-nose syndrome is linked to a 
cold-loving fungus known as Geomyces destructans and usually strikes 
during hibernation, which lasts between October and April.

Despite
attempts to battle the fungus by federal agencies and non-profit 
groups, it is feared the common little brown bat could disappear in the 
East and even in the Midwest if the fungus continues to spread.

There are also fears for the northern long-eared bat and the Indiana bat.

Reports
of erratic behaviour in the Great Smoky National Park, which has 275 
million visitors a year, started just before Christmas.

It is hoped bats in the U.S. will develop an immunity to the fungus, like bats in Europe have. But others fear the worst.

Mylea
Bayless, conservation programs manager for Bat Conservation 
International in Austin, said: 'Weâ€™re watching a potential extinction 
event on the order of what we experienced with bison and passenger 
pigeons for this group of mammals.'

White-nose syndrome (WNS) has been linked to the deaths of at least 5.7 million to 6.7 million North American bats. The condition was first discovered in Schoharie County, New York, USA, in February 2006.

Researchers conducted in 2011, found that the condition was caused by a fungus called Geomyces destructans, but no obvious 
treatment or means of preventing transmission is known.

It has rapidly spread and as of spring 2010, the condition had been found in over 115 caves and mines ranging mostly throughout the Northeastern US and as far south as Alabama and west to Missouri and into four Canadian provinces.

Most researchers agree that bat-to-bat transmission is the predominant factor in the spread of the disease. A recent study found that bat-to-bat contact is required for the spread of the disease.

The fungus Geomyces destructans has been found in soil samples from infected caves and suggests that it can be transported from cave to cave by soil, such as that carried by human clothing.

Precautionary decontamination methods are being encouraged to inhibit the possible spread of spores by humans.

Cave management and preservation organizations have been requesting that cave visitors limit their activities and disinfect clothing and equipment that has been used in possibly infected caves. In some cases, access to caves is being closed entirely.
