A dog who was rescued ten years ago from the flooded aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is now helping other abandoned animals at the Arizona Humane Society, as a 'nanny' in the organization's new kitten nursery. 

The Chow-Golden Retriever mix named Boots is helping the five to eight-week old kittens socialize and adjust to being around other animals, which make them better candidates for adoption. 

Calm Boots lets the little kittens snuggle up and play, without so much as a bark or growl.

Kitten's best friend: Boots, a dog who was rescued in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, is now living with his new owner in Phoenix, Arizona where he also volunteers once a week in a kitten nursery at the Arizona Humane Society

'He doesn’t care about what the kittens [do]. He doesn’t get excited. He doesn’t get in their face,' Humane Society's Liz Truitt said 

'He’s been an unofficial nanny for us. When he came into the nursery, he was the perfect dog for this role, because he’s so laid-back,' the Humane Society's Liz Truitt told NBC Today. 'He doesn’t care about what the kittens [do]. He doesn’t get excited. He doesn’t get in their face. He just basically lets them come to him on their terms. It’s the perfect first interaction with a dog for these guys.'

The reason for Boots' stoic personality may have to do with the fact that he lived through Hurricane Katrina  nearly a decade ago - which is how he got his name.

'His paws were so ripped up, he had (such) intense burns on his paws that he needed medical attention — hence, how he got the name Boots,' Bretta Nelson, a spokeswoman for the humane society, said of Boots who was just two years old at the time.

Pounce: Boots was one of 300 dogs rescued in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and unfortunately he was never reunited with his original owners. Luckily though, one volunteer with the Arizona Humane Society adopted Boots and he now lives with her in Phoenix

A cat dog: The Chow-Golden Retriever mix started volunteering in the kitten nursery because he interacts so well his his owner Susan Juergensen's cats at home

Boots got his name from his paws, which were so torn up after Hurricane Katrina that he required surgery

Boots was one of the 300 dogs found abandoned in New Orleans after the hurricane, and one of the 240 that were never reunited with their owners. 

But volunteers with the Arizona Humane Society took a shining to Boots and he was adopted by volunteer Susan Juergensen who took him to live at her home in Phoenix, along with her cats.

Because he got along so well with his new owner's cats, Boots seemed a perfect dog to help the kittens in the AHS' new kitten nursery, which opened in May. 

Now Boots visits the nursery once a week to interact with the kittens, who appear very comfortable around the much-bigger dog in pictures posted to the society's Facebook page.
