One Florida couple got more than they bargained for, in the best way possible, when a group of dolphins photobombed their wedding pictures. 

Alexis and Steve Espey, of Jacksonville, Florida, tied the in September 2012, and decided to celebrate their big day at Marineland Dolphin Adventure.

And when the couple went in for a big kiss in front of their wedding photographer, the dolphins suddenly sprung to action, performing what looked to be a perfectly choreographed routine every time.

Flipping out: Alexis and Steve Espey got the shock of a lifetime when a dolphin photobombed their wedding photos

Greatest of ease: The pair of dolphins that popped up in their photos seemed to have planned their routines perfectly

Big day: This all happened when the couple has their wedding ceremony at Marineland Dolphin Adventure in Florida

In another shot, two dolphins lean over the tank and watch closely as Steve lays a kiss on Alexis' cheek. 

'The reaction to the picture of the dolphin appearing when Steve and Alexis kissed has been incredible,' said Sarah McLachlan, the couple's photographer.

'The dolphins appearing at their wedding was a really special moment, and was perfectly timed with their first kiss at the end of the ceremony.'

Big kiss: The dolphins also seemed to be very interested when Steve went to lay a kiss on his new bride

Big monet: the couple's wedding photographer, Sarah McLachlan, called the entire day 'magical'

So happy together: The couple were married in 2012

The only problem may have been that guests at the ceremony were paying closer attention to the dolphins than the newlyweds.

'Everyone was already clapping for the couple, but when the dolphins jumped everyone went wild as though it was something from the movies,' McLachlan, who actually photographs weddings alongside her own husband, Ben, told Caters News. 

New friend: Everyone at the wedding got some time alone with the adorable mammals 

Showoffs: The couple, from Jacksonville, Florida, both seem to have a love of dolphins

Bling: McLachlan said the dolphins were also a big hit with friends and family as they watched the wedding ceremony

'It was a truly magical day.'
