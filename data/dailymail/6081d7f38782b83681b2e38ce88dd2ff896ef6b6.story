A New York City teacher got so frustrated with the rowdy students at the back of her classroom that she fantasized out loud about stabbing them.

Investigators heard that Jacqueline Baffoni, 32, kept a knife for slicing fruit in her desk drawer. When her eighth-grade children wouldn't stop talking, Ms Baffoni said: 'I feel like stabbing some of these kids - I have a knife here.'

The teacher had been warned just a day earlier that her probation period might not be extended at the Collaborative Academy of Science Technology and Language Arts on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and she was fired in June 2012.

The New York Post reported that Ms Baffoni made the comments during last school year. The incident came just after receiving written notification that the school was considering 'discontinuing' her probation.

Another teacher at the school told the Office of the Special Commissioner of Investigation (SCI) that this warning 'might have prompted' Ms Baffoni's outburst. 

It is as yet unclear why her probation was under threat - Ms Baffoni had been teaching at the school since 2009, but lost her job before the investigation could take place in mid-October last year.

A second student told the SCI that the teacher reacted to students' bad behavior by saying: 'I have a knife in this room, and I wish I could stab them!'

Ms Baffoni sent an email to the Post defending herself from what she describes as 'false allegations' and 'slanderous rumors.'

She claims she was highly dedicated to her students and that: 'I would never wish to cause harm to any of my children.'

Indeed, Ms Baffoni had used the website Donors Choose to raise over $400 worth of books for her students.

During these efforts she spoke proudly of her children, claiming: 'Many teachers may tell this tall tale, but I really do teach the best students in New York City!'

Tracy Wu, a former flatmate of Ms Baffoni, who is also a teacher, told the Post that this outburst was most likely due to her friend just venting her exasperation.

'I can understand her saying something like that in the heat of the moment while being stressed out,' said Ms Wu.

'She is incredibly dedicated to her job and to her kids - probably more than she should be,' Wu added.

'For some of the kids’ birthdays, she holds barbecues... and she spends her own money on them. She really makes them feel like family.'
