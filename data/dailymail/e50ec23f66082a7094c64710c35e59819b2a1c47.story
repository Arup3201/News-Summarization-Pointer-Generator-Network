James Ward got the British campaign at the Aegon Championships off to an excellent start with a straight sets win over Blaz Rola at The Queen’s Club.

The world No 155 overcame a 64-place ranking deficit to edge past the Slovenian 7-5, 6-4.

It was altogether more straightforward than the 12-10 decider Ward needed to beat Rola to qualify for the French Open last month.

Sharp: Ward was in impressive form as he overcame a 64-place ranking deficit to beat Rola

But he survived an early wobble when, having broken Rola’s serve in the first game, he gave up the advantage immediately.

Ward broke
 again in the 11th game of the first set, blazing a forehand pass down 
the line to force the break point after Rola rushed the net. Rola then 
netted a forehand to put Ward in front.

Ward,
 who was given a wildcard to the event, then stole the decisive 
advantage in the second set by breaking in the ninth to set up a 
second-round meeting with fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov.
