A Brazilian teenager died when a game of Russian roulette went badly wrong, the men accused of killing her have claimed.

Natalia Jeane Germano, 19, died instantly after being shot in the head whilst at the house of a friend. 

It has been claimed that Natalia dared one of her pals to pull the trigger when he was pointing a gun at her - and did not realise the chamber was loaded.

Dumped: Her friends claim she was killed when a game of Russian roulette went tragically wrong - but her mother Maria says she does not believe their version of events

She was missing for two days before her body was discovered hidden in bushes last Saturday in the city of Maringá in the southern state of Parana.

Three men have been arrested and charged with her death, but they have told police it was a tragic accident after a game of Russian roulette went tragically wrong.

But her heartbroken mother Maria José Germano told local media she did not believe that her daughter's death was an accident and claimed the house she died in was a drug den.

Mrs Germano said her  unemployed daughter had attended a job interview on the morning of the day she disappeared. 

Two days later, her body was found wrapped in a plastic bag on wasteland in the north of the city and she had a single bullet hole in her head.

She said: 'I do not believe this story that she died in this game. The house where she died was a drugs point.'

Mrs Germano added: 'She was mouthy and may have made some sort of comment and was killed. 

'My daughter was not a drug trafficker and did not use drugs. What she did wrong was get involved with this kind of friendship.

'In addition to killing my daughter, they threw her body in a bush like a dog. This hurt me too much, it will be with me forever.'

The three suspects were charged with aggravated murder, concealment of the body, drug trafficking and trafficking association.  

Police are believed to have found marijuana and cocaine in the house of Jonathan Nathaniel Francisco da Silva, where the killing happened. 

The man accused of killing Natalia was named in Brazilian media as Victor Hugo Lima Bueno and the third man arrested has been named as Jhon Weberton Alves Costa.

The Civil Police are continuing to investigate the case, even after the arrest of three suspects.
