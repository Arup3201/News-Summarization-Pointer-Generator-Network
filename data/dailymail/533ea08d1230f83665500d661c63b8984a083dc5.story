Professional cyclist and surfer Tito Tomasi, 29, ditched the skis and decided to race down a mountain in the Alps on a specially-adapted bike.

The sportsman, from Nice, France, then slalomed his way through the icy alpine trees in the picturesque forest nearby.

Photographer Alex Buisse, 29, from Chamonix, France, braved the wind and -3C temperatures to capture Tino's daredevil antics on camera.

Tomasi pedalled at breakneck speeds for four hours to descend the mountain, and as the picture on the right shows, navigating through deep snow was problematic

Some of the journey was impossible to cycle, so Tomasi was forced to haul his bike up high gradients, all by himself 

The professional cyclist and surfer  pushed his Rocky Mountain Blizzard Fat Bike to the limit on the slopes of the Aravis mountains

The pair scaled 2,624ft (800m) up the Pointe de Merdassier peak, which stands at 7,588ft (2,313m), to take the pictures at 6am.

Tito then pedalled at breakneck speeds for four hours to descend the mountain before tearing through the trees.

Alex said: 'Tito pushed it to its limits on an exposed ridge and on steep slopes.

Tomasi raced down the ridges on his specially-adapted bike as the sun rose over the Alps mountains for a spectacular experience 

Tomasi's daring ride was captured by photographer Alex Buisse, 29, from Chamonix, France, who braved the wind and and freezing cold

Tomasi was forced to slalom his way through a forest at the base of the Alps, and right, the extent of depth of snow is evident

'Climbing up the ridge by night, in deep snow at times, with the wind blowing and carrying our respective equipments was definitely a big challenge.

'But seeing the beautiful sunrise made it all okay though.'

Alex, who used a Nikon D4 in the shoot, insisted that Tito risked it all to top 20mph on the slopes.

Alex said: 'This was an experiment to see how far Tito could push the bike, as it isn't really designed for such vertical and exposed mountain terrain.

Tomasi scaled 800 metres of the Pointe de Merdassier peak, which stands at 2313 metres, with photographer Buisse following his every step

Tomasi admitted to crashing a lot, but judging by the terrain and heights he scaled, that is hardly surprising

How the French cyclist even managed to cycle through such thick snow hiding the unknown is remarkable

'And we had to stop a little because avalanche conditions were getting too dangerous.

'But even though Tito crashed quite a lot, he was fine thanks to the soft snow.'

Rocky Mountain Blizzard, who manufacture the snow-adapted Fat Bike, sponsor the cyclist as well as audio firm ION and cycling brand Urge.
