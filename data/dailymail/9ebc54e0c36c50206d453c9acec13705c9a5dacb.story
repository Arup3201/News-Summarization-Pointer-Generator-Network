Explosive: Kara Koriath, 44 (pictured), is facing charges of second-degree assault after igniting fireworks while driving her two teenage sons in November

A 44-year-old Missouri mother is being accused of trying to kill her two teenage sons in a revenge plot aimed at an ex-lover who refused to leave his wife for her.

Kara Koriath, of St Louis County, set off fireworks inside her SUV while driving sons Andrew and Matthew Dreste, 16 and 13, the morning of November 20.

The SUV caught fire, causing Koriath to lose control of the GMC Arcadia and crash - hitting a guardrail and two signs.

All three survived, but prosecutors say that wasn't Koriath's intent.

On Tuesday, the mother was charged with two counts of first-degree assault for the smoke inhalation and burns suffered by her two sons.

According to documents filed in court, Koriath planned the attack after getting into a row with her married boyfriend the night before.

Cell phone documents show she gave him an ultimatum to leave his wife, but he seemed to refuse.

She then sent a series of 'good-bye texts', including the ominous: 'it will haunt you every day of your life'.

The next morning, Koriath woke her sons up early and lied to them, saying they needed to go to the hospital because their grandmother was having a heart attack.

Setting fire: Koriath woke her two sons up the morning of November 20, saying they needed to go to the hospital to visit their grandmother. On the road, Koriath set off fireworks inside the SUV

Distracting: The ensuing explosion caused Koriath to lose control of the vehicle and crash on the side of the road - hitting a guardrail and two signs

Koriath started driving northbound on
 1-270 around 6am - the same route her ex used to drop his kids off at 
school - when a witness saw her lighting something inside the SUV.

Popping sounds were heard and then the SUV became engulfed in flames.

The choas inside the vehicle caused Koriath to lose control and crash the vehicle on the side of the road.

Koriath and her sons were transported
 to the hospital for serious injuries. All three survived but her sons 
are still recovering from burns. They are now in the care of another 
relative.

Planned: Mortars were found strapped to three of the headrests in the car

After the crash, investigators found several pieces of evidence that show the seriousness of Koriath's revenge plot.

Inside the vehicle, they found consumer-grade mortar shells strapped to three headrests along with lighter fluid and more fireworks in the glove compartment.

There were 'numerous packages of fireworks strategically placed and tied together with fuses and pipe cleaners throughout the vehicle' and gasoline soaked the floorboards.

Koriath, at least, didn't seem to think she would survive the well-organized explosion.

At her home, investigators found after-death instructions, a will left on the desk, suicide letters and a recently-purchased life-insurance policy. 

Initially, the mother was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of prescription pills, but the additional charges were added on Tuesday. Her bail has been set at $200,000.

According to KTVI, Koriath's home is now vacant and she has lost her job at Wells Fargo Advisors.
