MP Tom Watson sparked the police investigation into child abuse at a guest house after a speech into the Commons

Police investigating allegations of a child paedophile network have seized a list naming  top politicians, members of the royal household and a world-renowned pop star, it was reported today.

They were allegedly visitors to a bed and breakfast guest house which operated as a brothel where youngsters were abused at gay sex parties.

The names were recorded on a handwritten note found by police at the North London home of child protection worker Mary Moss during a raid.

She had initially declined to co-operate with the investigation. Documents and a laptop were seized and Ms Moss later handed over other 19 files she had put in a neighbour's shed.

The papers include a list of men who went to sex parties in the 80s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south west London.

Among them were two former Conservative Cabinet ministers, four other senior Tories, a Labour MP, a prominent Irish republican and a leading National Front member, according to the Sunday People.

The note also allegedly names two members of the royal household – one a former Buckingham Palace employee – plus the owner of a multinational company and two pop stars.

One of those is a best-selling musician, but like some others on the list he is not suspected of being involved in any child abuse.

Linked to child sex scandals: Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith and disgraced traitor Anthony Blunt

The list emerged at meetings in 1988 
between child protection officials and the guest house’s manager Carole 
Kasir, who died aged 47, two years later from a suspected overdose.

The paper said that 16 boys from nearby Grafton Close council home were allegedly trafficked to the guest house and abused.

Now detectives are to check social services records from Richmond, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Hounslow.

Officers will also be examining copies of cash receipts and ­the guest house’s visitor records.

Famous names linked to child sex rings include Liberal MP Cyril Smith in Rochdale and disgraced traitor Anthony Blunt, the former Keeper of the Queen’s Pictures.

A complaint by Labour MP Tom Watson during a speech in the House of Commons sparked Operation Fernbridge. He claimed a paedophile ring used high-level connections to escape justice.

Ms Moss told the People: 'They [police] were friendly enough but I thought it was heavy handed and a complete violation of my ­privacy..

The Met confirmed their statement to the Mail Online. 'The investigation will be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command.

'The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially assessed under Operation Fairbank, which was from information passed to police by Mr Tom Watson.'
