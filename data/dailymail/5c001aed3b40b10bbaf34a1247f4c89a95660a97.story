Upheaval: Lord Hall said the Corporation’s channels could soon be replaced by internet catch-up services

For decades we’ve sat down in our millions to watch the most popular TV shows go out at their scheduled time. 

But the days of the nation viewing Strictly Come Dancing or Call The Midwife together are numbered, says the BBC’s Director General.

In a warning to viewers, Lord Hall said the Corporation’s channels could soon be replaced by internet catch-up services.

The BBC already puts out some shows solely on its iPlayer service, including a series of films last month starring Meera Syal, Bob Mortimer and Frankie Boyle. 

BBC Three programmes such as Bad Education are even shown online first before being aired on TV. 

Lord Hall said: ‘I don’t know how long it will be before channels as a way of organising our viewing... are overtaken by us saying, “It’s all on demand.” 

'We’ve got to prepare for an age where it’s all on the go, it’s on demand.’

The peer made his comments at an event to celebrate the 60th anniversary of BBC News last week. 

'He said the Corporation was doing all it could to keep pace with technological change and that in his ‘gut’ he thought viewers would watch traditional TV for ‘a long way ahead into the future’. 

But when asked to clarify what he meant, he said: ‘No, because I know what’ll happen. 

Someone will say, “You said 15 years, 20 years, and it turned out to be ten.” Or, “You said five years, and it turned out to be 20.” All I know is, my iPad was not invented five years ago.’

Looking to the future: The peer, speaking at an event to mark the 60th anniversary of BBC News, said they needed to prepare for an age when all television was watched on the go, requiring it to be 'on demand'
