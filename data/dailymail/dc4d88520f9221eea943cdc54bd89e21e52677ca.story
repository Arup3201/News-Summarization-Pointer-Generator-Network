Living at zero gravity some 200 miles from the Earth's surface, Reid Wiseman has a pretty unique view of the world - and the NASA astronaut has been sharing his experience with his Twitter followers.

Expedition 41 crew member Reid has been working aboard the International Space Station and fills his spare time snapping stunning images of the Earth and cosmos before posting them online.

The NASA flight engineer intersperses the majestic shots with Tweets detailing his daily life at zero gravity.

He has revealed that he has not had a shower in more than 100 days, he drinks coffee from a bag and needs to exercise for hours a day just so his muscles do not decay.

'It's the most difficult but it's also the most enjoyable part of being up here,' Reid told NBC News. 'Your body has to learn a new way to work, to think, to eat. It's just really, really cool.'

'It's pretty tough to be homesick when you're floating around going 18,000 miles an hour in the space station,' he said. 'This is a wild, great place to work.'
