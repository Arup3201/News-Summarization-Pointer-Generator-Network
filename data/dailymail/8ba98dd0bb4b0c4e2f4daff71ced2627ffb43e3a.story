Adrian Grenier was spotted snuggling up to a mystery brunette last week but he was showcasing a whole different kind of chemistry in new photos for a denim company's ad campaign.  

The Entourage star appears in a series of romantic black and white images alongside wildlife photographer and model Amber Arbucci for his very first fashion campaign. 

The 38-year-old actor has been hired as the face of  fashion brand Buffalo David Bitton and his first job is featuring in their spring/ summer 2015 campaign.

Buffalo is also teaming up with Grenier through their 'Blank Check Series' to support the actor's upcoming documentary '52: The Search for the Loneliest Whale', where he tries to find the 52 Hertz Whale.

Buffalo David Bitton's 'Blank Check Series' presents exceptional visionaries, influencers, performers and artists with funding  to create engaging multi-dimensional content.

Adrian, who has previously dabbled in the fashion industry when he played Anne Hathaway's on-screen boyfriend in The Devil Wears Prada,  seemed eager to take part in the the stylish shoot,

The photos were shot as part of a Spring/ Summer 2015 ad campaign 

He said: 'This is my first fashion campaign, so when Buffalo approached me I was really excited to work with them.

'They valued my creative input and wanted to take this beyond just a fashion shoot to make this a campaign for a greater good to support a cause that is significant to me.'

Despite the convincing chemistry with Amber Arbucci, Adrian is rumoured to be seeing another woman after being pictured planting a kiss on a mystery brunette last week.

It is surprising that the actor has any time for romance with all of the projects he juggles.   

Earlier this month, the star ran for Team Lonely Whale at the New Year's Resolution Run in Long Beach, a trek that sees participants jog 15 kilometres.

The name of Adrian's team name was likely a nod to his upcoming marine documentary, 52: The Search For The World's Loneliest Whale In The World.

The film will explore a real-life whale who communicates at a frequency unknown to any other underwater giant.

Adrian serves as the producer of the documentary, which is due to be released in 2015.
