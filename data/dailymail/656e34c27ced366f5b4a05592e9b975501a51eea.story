A Catholic school teacher who was fired for being pregnant and unmarried has given birth to a son.

Shaela Evenson, who was dismissed from Butte Central Elementary School in Montana in January, and her partner, Marilyn Tobin, welcomed Brody Tobin Evenson on March 7.

The child - the couple's first - was born weighing 6lb 15oz, the Montana Standard reported.

The parents' joy comes after a troublesome few months for the family, after Evenson was dismissed by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena on January 10.

The diocese received an anonymous letter 
saying the teacher was pregnant, administrators decided to fire her not 
based on her merit but because her pregnancy violated their belief 
system.

They said Evenson, who has taught literature and physical education at the school for nine years, had violated her employment contract, in which she agreed to follow Catholic teachings.

Evenson, 36, is not a Catholic herself.

Her attorney, Brian Butler of Ohio, filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this month.

He argued an employer 
can't require employees to waive their rights under anti-discrimination 
laws - including a woman's right to bear children.

Both Butler and Superintendent Pat Haggarty said Evenson was not fired for being a lesbian.

'They
 told her she was fired for being pregnant and unmarried,' Butler said. 'Nobody was hiding anything. (Shaela) never denied the fact that sheâ€™s 
in a relationship with Marilyn.'

Her firing led to outcry among the community and across the country, and a GoFundMe page was set up to help her and Tobin, a former Montana Tech coach, with their family's costs. It has so far raised around $2,000.

'Besides being an outstanding educator and an inspiration to her young students, Shaela is in a long-term, committed relationship,' it explains. 'This pregnancy is hard-fought and very much wanted.'

The social justice group Faithful America and the teacher's friends, Susan Hawthorne and Margaret Rankin, also delivered a petition with 22,000 signatures to Bishop George Leo Thomas of The Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena weeks after her firing.

'Firing an unmarried teacher for becoming pregnant is cruel and hypocritical,' said the petition. 'Give Shaela Evenson her job back, and start taking Pope Francis' words about love and healing more seriously.'

Some Catholics pointed out that even Pope Francis has been signalling lately that unwed mothers should not be shunned by society.

Last month, the pontiff baptized a child born out of wedlock inside the Sistine Chapel, and in September, he offered an unmarried woman who had chosen not to have an abortion to personally baptize the baby.
