Riot police today marched on the last remaining protesters at Occupy Denver’s camp and were met with chants of ‘peaceful!' and ‘shameful!’.

Dozens of police advanced on the cluster of demonstrators supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement at the Colorado State Capitol.

The demonstrators retreated without resisting - but some were arrested as they backed away from their encampment on Friday.

Officers placed plastic ties around protesters' wrists, carried or dragged some from the encampment and took away others by the arm.

But there were no immediate signs of physical violence and an exact number of arrests has not yet been confirmed.

Stragglers were carried by police to small tractors and driven away.

Some protesters covered their faces with handmade masks or bandanas. Authorities began taking down dozens of tents at around 3:30am.

At about 6:30am, officers advanced on a line of protesters who had locked arms around the remaining tents.

Officers held their batons horizontally and nudged or pushed the protesters to break up the human chain.

By 7am, most of the group had retreated across a street that had been closed to traffic.

Some protesters moved back into the street when officers let traffic flow again, prompting police to herd them back to the sidewalk.

As in other cities, the Denver protesters said they object to Wall Street excesses and the economic power of the rich.

'This is a very disciplined action'

‘My main complaint is there is no more middle class in America. The rich control most of the money,’ said David Humphrey, 24, of Pine, Colorado.

He carried a sign with a picture of President Barack Obama and the words ‘Change God bless.’

Pavlos Stavropoulos of Littleton, Colorado, a medic for the protest, had seen no serious injuries. ‘This is a very disciplined action,’ he said.
