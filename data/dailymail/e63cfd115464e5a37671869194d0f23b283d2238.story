The West Ham footballer was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor

Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison threatened to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed, a court heard today.

Former Manchester United midfielder Morrison, 21, is also accused of threatening to blow up her house in a course of harassment against his ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor lasting four years, Manchester Magistrates’ Court heard.

The West Ham footballer was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of July 27 in Salford.

Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, sat in the dock at the court for the brief hearing as the harassment allegation was also added to the charges.

The court heard the additional charge of causing his ex-girlfriend to fear violence would be used against her spanned the period from January 1 2010 to July 20 this year.

The charge alleges he threatened to throw acid in her face, blow up her house and have her killed and other threats of violence.

David Fish QC, representing Morrison, indicated the defendant would be pleading not guilty to the charges.

District Judge Khalid Qureshi bailed Morrison to appear at Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on August 28.

Morrison, originally from Manchester, was initially remanded in custody last week before being bailed.

His bail conditions are that he lives in Canary Wharf, London, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, does not go on to the street where they live, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance, to see his lawyers or to visit for a West Ham game in the area and to return to London immediately after the match. 

Claims: The charge alleges Morrison threatened to throw acid in Reah Mansoor's face, blow up her house and have her killed, as well as other threats of violence

Miss Mansoor's mother Parveen Mansoor was also allegedly attacked in the incident

Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012

Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR.

Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under-21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October and was subject to a bid from Fulham in January - although the offer was rejected.
