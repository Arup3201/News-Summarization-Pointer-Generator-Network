He's skilled in cash-handling, customer service ... and fighting off would-be thieves.

When Texas gas station clerk Mayura Dissanyake saw his colleague being attacked by two men, the trained mixed martial arts professional unleashed his fury.

Security footage shows him running to his co-worker's defense outside Fuel Depot in Houston before laying into the alleged attackers with moves honed through years of cage fighting.

'The first guy I saw, I just kicked him in the face,' the native Sri Lankan told Click 2 Houston. 'Then I punched the other guy.'

 the floor,' he said.

'Until he stopped moving cause I wasn't sure if he
 had a knife or a gun so I wanted him to stop moving.'
