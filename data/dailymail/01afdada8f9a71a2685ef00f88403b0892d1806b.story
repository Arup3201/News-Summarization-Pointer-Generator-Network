A bride who feared she would never walk down the aisle after being diagnosed with a brain tumour has finally married her fiance.

Stephanie Parr was forced to cancel her wedding to fiance Neil after she suffered a fit last April. She was later diagnosed with a tumour the size of a tennis ball.

Doctors told her she had been living with the tumour for years - and she could either leave it be, and hope it didn't keep growing, or undergo risky surgery to have it removed.

She bravely decided to go under the knife just weeks before she was supposed to get married. 

Stephanie Parr, with husband Neil, had feared she wouldn't live to see her wedding day after doctors discovered she had a brain tumour the size of a tennis ball

The couple were forced to cancel their wedding after Stephanie suffered a fit and was diagnosed with the tumour last April

As Stephanie, 32, lay in intensive care on what should have been her wedding day, she feared she would never live to see the day she would finally marry Neil.

But this Saturday, the couple, from Littleover, Derbyshire, finally tied the knot.

Stephanie said: 'In December 2011, I was really fit and healthy. I met Neil through my brother, David, and we got on straight away.

'We have the same sense of humour and we just knew we were right for each other. Within three months, we'd moved in together and, within eight, Neil had proposed.'

But their joy was cut short when Neil, 31, woke one night and heard Stephanie making an unusual sound.

Doctors told Stephanie she had been living with the tumour for years - and was told she could either leave it be, and hope it didn't keep growing, or undergo risky surgery to have it removed. She chose the latter

She said: 'He tried to wake me up but
he couldn't. So he called an ambulance and I was taken to the Royal 
Derby Hospital. The doctors there said it looked like I'd suffered a 
seizure.'

Stephanie was taken in for tests and, in February last year, was told she needed a brain scan in April. She went to fetch the results with her mother Alison.

Stephanie said: 'I thought it might be epilepsy, that was all. I genuinely wasn't that bothered. I was in no pain.

'But, when I got in there, they asked who was with me. I said 'Mum' and I suddenly knew something was up.'

She was told she had a brain tumour 2.75 inches (7cm) across and had had it for years.

Stephanie chose to go under the knife just weeks before she was due to marry. She was in intensive care on her original wedding day

She said: 'Until you hear something like that, you'll never quite know how it feels. I thought that was it.

'I saw the fact that I just found the person I really loved, I saw the fact that we were set to be married and have children and, in one second, I knew it was all gone, finished. I was devastated.'

But doctors told her  the tumour was not an immediate threat. They classed it as level two out of a possible four - not benign, but not yet fatal.

Despite having the tumour removed, there is a chance another tumour could grow in the future.

Stephanie said: 'I'm waiting until we get back from our honeymoon in Mexico to get the latest update.

'It's not like it's gone forever now - and I do think about it.

'But, Neil and I have been lucky enough to get married and be together. I've learned so much over the past year, not the least of which is that every second of this life is precious. This wedding is even more special because of what has happened.'
