Angry Manchester United fans have bombarded a woman on Twitter with hundreds of irate messages after mistaking her for the daughter of manager David Moyes.

Sarah Moyes, 27, who uses the Twitter handle @moyesy, has received a constant flurry of abusive and hurtful messages since the beleaguered boss took over the Premier League club from Sir Alex Ferguson last year.

However, fed up of fans venting their fury at her after Man U’s 3-0 defeat to rivals Manchester City on Tuesday, the comedy club worker pointed out she was no relation and politely asked people to stop.

Sarah Moyes, who is no relation to Manchester United boss David Moyes, asked fans to stop sending the messages on Tuesday after the Premier League club's defeat to rivals Manchester City

Miss Moyes, from Falkirk, Scotland - who happens to have a brother called David – wrote: ‘I am no relation to the football manager David Moyes. Can people please stop mentioning me in tweets, I'm pretty sure he has his own account.’

But, it only seemed to make things worse and her message went viral after it was retweeted nearly 5,000 times - including by football legend Gary Lineker to his 2.25m followers.

She said: ‘It just went crazy after that. Most of the messages are jokey ones like “tell your dad he should be sacked”.

‘But there have been a couple of really horrible ones.

‘I had one that called me quite a few horrible names and told me to die, that was pretty extreme.

‘There have been quite a few messages saying “just change your name”, but I've been called Moyesy since I was a teenager.’

Confused fans have even branded Miss Moyes a ‘disgrace to MUFC’, accused her of 'ruining Man United' with her 'useless tactics' and demanded her resignation.

Other tweets were more measured - one called on the club to give her more time but questioned why she was playing Juan Mata on the wing.

Miss Moyes, who works in press and marketing for The Stand comedy club in Edinburgh, said she initially saw the funny side.

But she added: ‘It's a little bit annoying when my phone keeps constantly going.

‘I'm hoping it's going to die down a bit and people will just leave me alone.

‘I've more than doubled my followers in the last couple of days but most of them are football fans and they aren't going to be interested in anything I've got to say.

‘My tweets tends to be about comedy or music. Nobody's going to get any football commentary out of me.’

David Moyes' actual daughter Lauren, 19, quit Twitter last year amid rumours she was in a relationship with £30,000-a-week footballer Wilfried Zaha.

However, both the football manager's daughter and Zaha denied the claims and said they had never even met.

Mr Moyes, 50, who is married to Pamela and has a son called David Jnr, 22, as well as daughter Lauren, took over as Manchester United boss from Sir Alex Ferguson in July last year.
