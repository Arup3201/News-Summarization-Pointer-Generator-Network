A three-year-old girl may have tried to change her tiny brother’s nappy just moments before he suffocated to death in his cot, an inquest heard today.

The little girl was alone in the room in Witney, Oxfordshire, with six-month-old baby Feonyx Clarke before he was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head.

The coroner, who would not name the girl, recorded an open verdict on the death - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs.

'Very sad and tragic': Feonyx Clarke, of Witney, Oxfordshire, was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head

Kirsty Clarke, their mother, had earlier told the hearing that her daughter - referred to in the inquest as ‘T’ - may have tried to change Feonyx in his cot in an upstairs room without her knowledge.

Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours later at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

A pathologist told the inquest in Oxford that Feonyx’s brain was starved of oxygen, but could not explain how this happened. The unused nappy bags which were found in Feonyx’s cot had not been there when his mother checked on him 20 minutes earlier.

Dr Steve Gould, a consultant paediatric pathologist, gave a cause of death as acute cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury and sudden unexpected death in infancy - which remains unexplained.

‘There was a lack of oxygen to the tissues, including the brain,’ he said. ‘What has caused it is not something I can explain during the course of the investigation.

‘What was found could be the cause of the collapse or just as likely the result of the collapse.’

He added: ‘It is possible (nappy bag death). I can’t exclude it. It could be suffocation or it could be a naturally occurring collapse with an unknown cause, which then goes onto cause these symptoms.’

Feonyx was also found to be suffering from bronchopneumonia as he had been unwell in the days leading to his death.

Mrs Clarke, 27 - newly married to waste collector Gavin - provided a police statement following the baby’s death.

‘There were some toys at the bottom of the cot which he could not reach. He had a snuggle over him. Apart from that there was nothing in the cot,’ she said.

The full-time mother collected her oldest child ‘N’ from school with her father watching over Feonyx. She came back after 4pm.

'I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn’t appear to breathing'

Kirsty Clarke

‘At about 5pm ‘T’ went upstairs. She was three years old at this time and ‘N’ seven,’ her statement said. 'I went up after her to see what she was doing.

‘She got back into my bed and went straight to sleep. I checked on Feonyx. He was warm so I removed his blanket and then went back downstairs.

‘Between about 5.20pm or 5.30pm I went back up to check on him. He was lying face down on some nappy bags. Also in the cot was a clean nappy with a bag of baby wipes.

‘They had not been in the cot at 5pm when I had changed him. T was still in my bed. She was under my duvet, so I do not know whether she was asleep or not. I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp.

'I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn’t appear to breathing. I started CPR and called 999. I did CPR until paramedics arrived. They then took him to hospital.’

She said that Feonyx, born on November 8, 2012, was a ‘bubbly and playful’ child, who had only seen his health visitor and doctor for routine baby check-ups and eight-week injections.

During evidence, brunette Kirsty told the hearing: ‘He was teething and had a cold the days before and was a bit more sleepy (than normal). I remember nappy bags in the cot.

‘I don’t remember if his face was on 
them. They were at the top of the cot. There were four or five loose 
nappy bags. At 5pm there were no nappy bags, no wipes and no nappies (in
his cot). There was no bed in his room. T was in another room.’

'It was a very sad and tragic death'

Darren Salter, Oxfordshire Coroner

Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter asked her: ‘It is possible that T may have tried perhaps to change Feonyx? That would be an explanation wouldn’t it?'

Mrs Clarke replied: ‘Yes.’ She said nappy bags would normally be kept on a window sill. Feonyx died at 1.18pm on May 25, 2013.

Coroner Mr Salter said: ‘All I can say is repeat what Dr Gould said. The suffocation on nappy bags is possible and can’t be fully excluded, but there is no direct evidence at the post-mortem of it.

‘The best thing for me to do is return what is called an open verdict where the evidence at the inquest doesn’t fully show what the cause of death is.

‘I think the most likely aspect of this was that it was a natural cause, but it is hard to determine what that natural cause was. It was a very sad and tragic death.’
