Eric Slighton, 53, has had high powered jobs at banks in Hong Kong. Now he has allegedly groped women while drunk and posing as TSA

A drunk man allegedly posed as a TSA officer at San Francisco airport before pulling two women into a private screening area to give them a pat down, police have said.

The 53-year-old, identified Thursday afternoon as financial executive Eric McLean Slighton, had already passed through security at the airport on Tuesday morning before drinking for a few hours in the airport lounge, according to the police report.

Slighton has been managing director of Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong, and according to his father he was due to fly to Hong Kong from San Francisco this week.

He was carrying business cards at the time of his arrest listing him as a 'director' at Aktis Capital Singapore, a high powered private equity company that lists him as one of four partners.

After passing through, he returned to the A-side
 security checkpoint of the airport's International Terminal and 
allegedly took a pair of plastic blue gloves so he would look the part.

He was wearing khakis, a blue polo shirt and blue rubber gloves - which is similar to the uniform worn by screeners for security company Covenant, who man the checkpoint and he may have stolen the gloves.

The financial powerhouse convinced an Asian woman, a foreigner who had already passed the screening, that he was a TSA agent and led her to a private screening area for a pat down, police said.

Authorities do not know what happened between Slighton and woman because she left for her flight afterwards and could not be tracked down.

The man then led another woman, who was also not a U.S. citizen, into the booth - but this time he was stopped by fellow agents who had become suspicious.

They noted that he was heading to the screening area alone with the woman - whereas male officers are only allowed to screen a woman if a female agent is with them.

Agents detained until police arrived and he was charged with public drunkenness.

Reached on the phone by the San Francisco Chronicle in New York, his father professed shock at his son's alleged actions

He said that while his son used to have a drinking problem, he has been sober for 10 year.

Authorities were unable to track down the two women who he allegedly groped, but if they come forward, Slighton could face more charges, such as false imprisonment, authorities said.

TSA have now taken over the investigation and has not returned MailOnline's request for comment about how the man was able to pose as an officer.

A law enforcement source suggested to the
 Chronicle that '[s]omeone has to pay for this'.
