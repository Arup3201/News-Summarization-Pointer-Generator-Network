Bookmakers predict a £10million betting avalanche on AP McCoy for his final five Cheltenham Festival rides on Friday afternoon.

The soon-to-retire 19-time champion struck for the first time at this meeting on Uxizandre in Thursday's Ryanair Chase and will be on board Irish-trained 10-1 shot Carlingford Lough on Friday as he tries to win the £550,000 Gold Cup for a third time.

He also has fancied rides on Hargam in the Triumph Hurdle opener and Ned Buntline in the concluding Grand Annual Chase, which has been named in his honour.

McCoy’s wife, Chanelle, had admitted that two unsuccessful days had left her soon-to-retire husband in a downbeat mood.

But after joining him on the winner’s podium, she said: ‘Inside he will be feeling elated. He is not the most animated at the best of times and he was slightly melancholy leaving the house this morning. This will absolutely mean the world to him. I’ll have a happy husband.’

McCoy’s 31st Festival success sets him up for his 20th and final ride in the £550,000 Gold Cup today on Carlingford Lough, owned, like Uxizandre, by his boss JP McManus. 

He has four other rides, including favourite Ned Buntline in the concluding AP McCoy Grand Annual Chase.
