File the following under the category of you simply would not have believed it possible if you had not witnessed it with your own eyes.

At the BMW Championship in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, Rory McIlroy followed up four putting from four feet at the 12th on Saturday with another four putt from inside 20 feet on the same hole on Sunday. ‘I actually holed a decent length putt as well to avoid the second five putt of my life,’ said McIlroy afterwards.

How on earth does this happen two days in a row, to the world No 1 of all people? Was the green perched on the side of a rocky mountain?

Mood: Rory McIlroy's putting was not up to scratch for the second day in a row, leaving him in a foul mood

In fact, it was just more evidence that no sport likes embarrassing its star performers quite like this one. As the Northern Irishman put it, succinctly: ‘It goes to show we are capable of doing the same things club golfers do every weekend.’

McIlroy had been playing beautifully as well. He was living up to the promise of a tweet he had dispatched earlier to seize the day and he certainly did that during a wonderfully played front nine of 30 strokes. All the momentum was with him, as he holed a 60 yard approach at the par four 7th for an eagle two.

Then came the fateful 12th. After a good tee shot to 19 feet, his first putt drifted five feet past the hole, and he pulled that one to leave himself a slippery three footer. When that one missed he leaned against his putter for the longest time.

Like the rest of us, he clearly couldn’t believe it was happening again. When he finally looked in the direction of his ball, he must have been horrified to see if further away from the hole than his previous two putts. Thankfully he knocked in the six footer, or he might still be there now. 

Two pars on that hole instead of a six and a five would have left McIlroy one shot off the lead, rather than playing out the last few holes for pride. He did that well enough, birdieing the 16th and 17th for a 66. ’There was no point dwelling on it,’ he said. ‘You can’t beat yourself up. We all know these things happen occasionally.’

The good news was that in the context of his season what happened at the 12th is meaningless, and it’s that way too concerning the FedEx Cup finale which begins in Atlanta on Thursday.

Attitude: McIlroy was philosophical when talking about his putting form on social media

Of the 30 competitors, he will start in third place and in control of his own destiny in the race for the $10million bonus. 

As for the BMW, American Billy Horschel held off a spirited challenge from Masters champion Bubba Watson and Sergio Garcia, who came to grief with a calamitous triple bogey eight at the 17th.

There was also plenty of high drama in the Swiss Alps, where little-known American David Lipsky prevailed at the first hole of a play-off against Englishman Graeme Storm in the Omega European Masters. 

European Masters: Graeme Storm enjoyed his best day since 2007 at European Masters, coming second

What a week this was for 36-year-old Storm. He went to Crans-sur-Sierre following a wretched season without a single redeeming top 20 finish, and in grave danger of losing his tour card.

On Saturday he won a £100,000 car for a hole-in-one that was more than he had earned all year. Then on Sunday he showed considerable composure to hole a stomach-churning six footer to make the play-off.

A poor drive cost him, alas, but the runner’s up prize of £178,480 still completed his best week since winning the 2007 French Open.
