Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Frenchman Stephane Rousson's 'aerosail' above the sea.

Rousson and his partners' ambition is to create an innovative, efficient, and silent maritime vehicle, only using the wind as means of propulsion.

By the end of October, the adventurer and researcher hopes to have crossed the Mediterranean, from Nice to Calvi on the island of Corsica. 

Trial: Rousson went for a practice run in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, southeastern France

Here's hoping: Rousson was in relaxed mood above the waters

Aerosail  unique principle of flight allows the user to pilot, like a sailboat, an airship linked by a cable to a stabilized keel, called the Seaglider. The cable acts as the mast and the airship as the sail.

And so Rousson went for a practice run in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, southeastern France prior to his planned crossing. 

Blown away: The French adventurer will be hoping it's life off come October and his Mediterranean challenge

The giant balloon begins to take shape, and is connected to the Seaglider

Close eye: In case Rousson gets into difficulty, the seaglider is on hand to rescue the situation

Back in 2008 Rousson was forced to abandon a scheduled crossing of the English Channel at the half-way point in his pedal-powered airship due to strong winds.

He will be hoping for calmer conditions on his Mediterranean challenge, otherwise there will only one winner in the man v the elements battle. 

Smile: Rousson gives the camera a wave as he perfects the final touches to his invention

Fingers crossed: If the wind remains mild, the airship can be guided by the pilot

Powering on: The aerosail on the landscape is a pretty sight
