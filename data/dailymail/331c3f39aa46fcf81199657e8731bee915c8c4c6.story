Last time he invaded Christmas, most of us were still figuring out our first email address, and tablets were something you took when you had a headache.

But when Furby attempts to dominate this time round, he will not only come with LED eyes, but also an iPad app in a bid to appeal to a generation growing up in the new digital landscape.

The bestselling toy from 1998 will come with a price-tag to match its new technology, with pre-orders opening in Walmart in the U.S. this week for $54 (£34).

The makers of Furby, Hasbro Toys, cited the opportunities of the digital age for the 21st century makeover.

Kenny Davis, the marking director for the company, told ABC News: ‘The original Furby was more than an animatronic toy; it was the first toy that appeared to have a brain.

‘We have been thinking about ways to give Furby a real personality.’

Among the changes are more sensors, so the new, Furby can respond better to touch. There are also apps for the iPhone and iPad that allow you to ‘feed’ the creature and translate what it says.

One thing that hasn’t changed – both versions of the furry toy speak the made-up language Furbish, a made-up language that sounds more like baby talk than anything.

The 1990s Furby could eventually be taught some English phrases, though the sentiment that most owners tried to teach it was only three words – ‘Me love you.’

The new Furby will cost nearly double the price of the original, but Hasbro thinks $60 is not too steep a price, especially for the new features.

‘People are looking at $60 video games; we thing people will play with Furby for longer than some of those video games,’ Mr Davis explained to ABC News.

When the toy was originally released in the 90s for the price of $35, people across the nation lined up for hours, sometimes camping overnight at toy stores.

Around the holidays, Furbies could sell for two to three times their sticker price.

The new Furby, available in up to ten colours, will hit shelves in the U.S. in September, according to Walmart. The toy will also be released worldwide.

Time will tell if they will be as popular as their antiquated cousins.
