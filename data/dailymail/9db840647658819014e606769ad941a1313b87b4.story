A former family home which was turned in to a nudist colony boasting a dungeon, pool and sauna has been ordered to close after a council ruled it breached planning laws.

The Kestrel Hydro Naturists Spa, in Stanwell Moor, Surrey, has seen membership soar since it opened nearly 10 years ago.

But after failing to get permission to run the spa as an adult private members' club as well as not getting approval for 'outdoor structures and hardstandings', Spelthorne Borough Council ordered it to be closed last week.

Planning breach: The Kestrel Hydro Naturists Spa, in Stanwell Moor, Surrey, has been told to close for flouting planning regulations

Flouting: The council found that the spa had not sought the right approval for its 'outdoor structures and hardstandings'

The spa boasts a string of outdoor attractions, including a sauna, hot tub, heated swimming pool and banqueting tent for members.

The council said it wanted the property to be returned to a 'family home' and for 'any structures installed by the Hydro' to be removed.

The planning committee heard how the spa had 'grown' in recent years and had 'become a full blown nudist colony....complete with dungeon'.

Couples pay £40 to attend the spa, with single women paying £15 and single men £50.

Graham Tattershall, a director of the 
spa, said the decision threatened the jobs of at least seven people and 
insisted he was still planning on holding a 'Bank Holiday Barbecue' on 
Monday August 26 and said he was fighting the decision.

He admitted that temporary planning 
permission for various outdoor attractions had lapsed, adding: 'I went 
into business nearly nine years ago with a view to running a 
hydrotherapy centre. It's grown over the years.

'The spa is run very professionally and there's no impact on the local village.

'We don't want to antagonise the council. It is all above board, we just want to carry on for our members.

'We will be appealing the decision and looking at another way of applying for permission.'

The spa's website states: 'Everyone has a first time! ...pluck-up the courage...and you will be amazed at the friendly, welcoming and fun community that you are joining.

'Our naturist spa provides a relaxed, intimate and no-pressure environment where you can relax, chat and make new friends.

'We provide a wide variety of interesting areas to explore and you may prefer to explore them on your own, as a couple, or with others.

'Both experienced and new couples are welcome at our Spa.

'The venue is naturist, hence you must remove all of your clothing in the changing area.

'You may use the towels provided, or bring your own. We also recommend that you bring your own flip flops and your own towelling robe, if you prefer.'

Row: Spelthorne Borough Council ordered the spa to be returned to a 'family home' after planning rules were found to have broken

Brian Taylor, of British Naturism, blasted the spa for claiming to be anything to do with 'Naturists', saying: 'I doubt this is a nudist colony as that term is generally understood.

'It certainly isn't a Naturist club recognised by British Naturism.

'Sadly we have no control over the use of the word 'naturism' and there are far too many adult clubs who, presumably ashamed of their true purpose, masquerade behind the respectable image of Naturism, by trying to call themselves that.

'We have no problem with the existence of adult/swingers clubs - each to their own, but we cannot forgive them muddying the image of Naturism because, time and again, this causes us problems.

'A nudist "colony", club or whatever you or they choose to call it, that has its own dungeon is not a Naturist club. We at British Naturism will not be defending this outfit'
