Officials have expressed their fears for the security of top-secret files Edward Snowden is believed to have - and how they worry he may be giving the information to countries helping him escape.

Their concerns come as it emerges that Snowden has already given encoded copies to several people in case anything happens to him as he attempts to elude the U.S. government.

While these copies of the files are heavily encoded, Snowden has arranged for them to be accessed if he is caught, according to Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who broke Snowden's story.

Authorities have said they are worried that the NSA whistleblower could also share the files with the countries - including China and Russia - they believe have helped the whistleblower escape.

Power: Officials are concerned over the security of the files Edward Snowden copied from the NSA - and are fearful that he may give them to foreign governments who help him elude the U.S.

Snowden, who fled Hong Kong on Sunday and now remains in a transit zone in a Moscow airport, gleaned the sensitive data after specifically taking a job with contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.

Three weeks ago, the Guardian and the Washington Post published details about Prism, which gives the NSA access to data on people via Facebook and Google, among other companies.

The NSA is now souring all systems they believe  the 30-year-old systems administrator could have accessed during his three months working for the company, sources told the Washington Post.

'They think he copied so much stuff - 
that almost everything that place does, he has,' said a former 
government official. 'Everyone's nervous about what the next thing will be, what will be 
exposed.'

Greenwald has indicated that these fears are justified.

'I know that he has in his possession 
thousands of documents, which, if published, would impose crippling 
damage on the United Statesâ€™ surveillance capabilities and systems 
around the world,' he told CNN.

But he added that Snowden 'has never done any of that' and that he has been selective in choosing what to expose, only wishing to shine a light on government practices, not endanger the country.

'Snowden himself was vehement from the 
start that we do engage in that journalistic process and we not 
gratuitously publish things,' Greenwald said.

'I do know he was vehement
about that, he was not trying to harm the U.S. Government, he was 
trying to shine light on it.'

A U.S. officials said publishing any more files at all could be devastating for the safety of the U.S.

'The more material that gets made 
public the more capability we lose,' he told the Post, adding that 
terrorist groups across the world have already started to change how 
they communicate based on what has already been divulged.

A spokesperson for WikiLeaks, which 
is aiding Snowden's escape and quest for political asylum, 
vehemently denied that foreign governments had made copies of the files,
the Post said.

Speaking with the Daily Beast, Greenwald added that Snowden handed over encoded files to several people that will be unlocked if anything happens to him.

He added that Snowden 'has taken extreme precautions to make 
sure many different people around the world have these archives to 
insure the stories will inevitably be published'.

He said that the people who have the files cannot yet access them, but if anything happens to Snowden 'he has has arranged for them to get access to the full archives', Greenwald said.

Greenwald added that he himself has thousands of documents from Snowden which he is continuing to look over - and added he is unsure whether the whistleblower has even more files.

'I believe he does,' he said. 'He was clear he did not want to give to journalists things he did not think should be published.'

Snowden told the South China Morning Post earlier this month that he took the job at Booz Allen Hamilton because of the access it afforded him, the paper said.

'My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked,' Snowden said, according to the article.

'That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.'

Since his leaks, it has emerged that he smuggled the highly classified files out with a humble computer thumb drive.
