Sir Rex Hunt, who was in charge of the Falkland Islands when Argentina invaded in 1982, has died aged 86.

Sir Rex was considered a hero in the Falklands for his courage in organising the resistance to the Argentine invasion.

He was taken prisoner by the Argentine invasion force and expelled to Uruguay.

But when Britain recaptured the islands following the 74-day war he returned as Governor and remained in post until 1985.

The Falkland Islands Government said it had received the news with 'great sadness'.

In a statement it added: 'He will 
forever be remembered in the islands for his years of service as 
Governor, and particularly for his courage and dignity in facing the 
Argentine invasion in 1982.

Governor Hunt and officials from the Foreign Office were forcibly evicted from the Falklands by the Argentine forces and sent to the Uruguayan capital Montevideo

'His numerous contributions to our 
home were recognised in his being granted the Freedom Of Stanley in 
1985.

'A loyal friend of the Falkland Islands, he served for many years 
as Chairman of the Falkland Islands Association and as President of the 
UK Falkland Islands Trust.

'His passion and commitment to the Falkland Islands will be sorely missed.'

The former Spitfire pilot was governor of the Falkland Islands between 1980 and 1985.

When the invasion began on April 1 1982, Sir Rex made Government House the operational headquarters for the Royal Marines, sending his wife and son away to a safe house, while all servants and domestic staff were told to leave with their most valued possessions. After a fierce battle in which outnumbered Royal Marines shot dead an Argentine navy officer, Sir Rex took the painful decision to surrender.In full gubernatorial uniform, including plumed governor's hat, he went to the town hall in Stanley to meet Admiral Carlos Busser, the Argentine general commanding the invasion.He refused to shake hands with him, and said: 'You have landed unlawfully on British territory and I order you to remove yourself and your troops forthwith.'This is British territory. You're not invited. We don't want you here. I want you to go now and take all your men with you.'Sir Rex also refused to shake hands with the new Argentine governor, General Garcia.

He was captured by invading Argentine forces during the 1982 invasion and forcibly evacuated to Montevideo in Uruguay.

Sir Rex later returned to London where he stayed during the 74 day war while his wife and son went to live in Kent.

The
islands were recaptured by British forces on June 14 that year after 
then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher deployed a naval taskforce to the 
South Atlantic ocean.

Sir Rex returned to Fort Stanley in July and was knighted by October 1982.

He also served for many years as 
chairman of the Falkland Islands Association and as president of the UK 
Falkland Islands Trust and was granted the freedom of the island 
capital, Stanley, in 1985.

Sir Rex had always been adamant that the war was worth it.

In an interview after the conflict he
said: 'The first thing I said to people, giving speeches here, was that
it was worth it and I have never had a word back from any 
of the people who went there - no matter how badly injured - who said it
wasn't worth it - not one.'

The brief but bitter war ended on 
June 14, 1982 as Argentinian commander General Mario Menendez 
surrendered to the British at Stanley. 

The British Task force reached the 
South Atlantic in May 1982 and retook South Georgia before preparing to 
retake the main Islands. 

The Argentinean Air force sank 
several British ships, and Exocet missiles sank the destroyer HMS 
Sheffield and the Atlantic Conveyor. Many other ships were damaged, some
badly with considerable loss of life, but the sinking of Argentinean 
Cruiser the General Belgrano by a British Submarine was considered a 
turning point.

The British fought their way across the island before the Argentine surrender.

The British lost 250 men and  took 
more than 10,000 prisoners of war, while the Argentines lost 746, of 
which 368 had been on the Belgrano when it sank.

The Falkland Islands, in the South Atlantic, are 7,780 miles from the UK and 1,140 miles from Buenos Aires. 

They have been under British control since 1833 - apart from the 74 days of occupation in 1982.
