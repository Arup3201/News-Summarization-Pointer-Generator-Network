A heartbroken Chinese mother claims her only son refuses to see her any more because he thinks she is 'too ugly'.

Ding Liang, 63, was found crying in the street in the city of Hangzhou in eastern China after travelling for five hours to try to meet her newborn grandchild.

She had lugged a carrying pole with bags of clothes and presents for the baby in the hope that her son might have a change of heart when she arrived.

But after he refused to answer his phone and because she did not know exactly where he lived, she was forced to leave in tears, taking the gifts back home with her.

Heartbroken: Ding Liang, 63, breaks down in tears as she tells a Chinese TV station how her son refuses to see her because he thinks she is 'too ugly'

Ding was spotted standing outside a housing complex by 53-year-old local man Hsin Pai, who was so shocked by her story that he called the local TV station, which turned up to interview her.

She told them that she was from a village outside Yuyao, a city in the same Chinese province as Hangzhou and that she had been very proud of her son and only child when he had done well at school and got a place at university.

After graduating, he had moved to Hangzhou after landing a good job at an upmarket car dealership and had married.

But he had reportedly been embarrassed by his mother's presence at his wedding because she had dressed like a peasant and after that he'd had very little to do with her.

In tears: Ding travelled for five hours to see her son and his newborn child, but he refused to answer his phone and she did not exactly where he lived

She said: 'I don't mind, I know he has his own life now, so I understand that he doesn't call and only speaks to me when I ring him.

'But when he rang me the other day to say that he had had a baby, I wanted to visit him and bring my grandchild some gifts.

'He told me not to come. He said I would embarrass him because I'm too ugly.'

She said she had decided to go anyway and had woken up at 4am to catch the bus to see her son, who she didn't name but who she said was 32 years old.

When she arrived, he had not answered the phone and she had been left out on the street unsure exactly which flat he was in.

He said: 'My husband told me not to come. I said our daughter-in-law has given birth, so I definitely must come, that I'll bring some stuff to give them.

'I got up at 4am and got here a little after 9am. But I have been waiting here all day long and my son is still not answering his phone.'

At the end of the day, she left still carrying the handmade baby clothes and gifts.

In a short TV programme about the woman's visit that ended up widely discussed in Chinese social media, the presenters acknowledged that there might be an additional reason why the son was refusing to see his mother who had clearly come bearing gifts for her grandchild.

But at the end of the day, they added: 'Whatever the additional matters might be if there are any, when it comes to a mother who gave birth to a child and raised that child, what is there that cannot ultimately be tolerated or forgiven?'
