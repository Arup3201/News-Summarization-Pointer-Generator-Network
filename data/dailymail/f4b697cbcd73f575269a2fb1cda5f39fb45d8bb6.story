A married teacher at a Catholic high school in Michigan faces life in prison after she was charged with repeatedly having sex with a 15-year-old student in her classroom.

Police say Kathryn Ronk, 29, engaged in a variety of sex acts with the student - including intercourse at Bishop Foley High School in Madison Heights, a Detroit suburb.

The Spanish teacher allegedly hooked up with the student in her classroom - sometimes after school, sometimes in between classes when Ronk had a break in her schedule, the Detroit Free Press reports.

Arrested: Kathryn Ronk, 29, faces life in prison after being charged with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for her alleged affair with a 15-year-old student

Ronk is pictured in her classroom, where she allegedly had sex with a teenage student at least five times

The trysts happened from January through April of this year. 

'According to our investigation, this was a combination of actual sexual intercourse and other sexual acts,' Madison Heights Deputy Chief Corey Haines told the Free Press.

Authorities began investigating Ronk on May 16, when the student's parents and the principal of the school,  the Reverend Gerry LeBoeuf, filed a complaint with police.

Ronk was promptly fired from her job, which she had started at the beginning of the school year last August.

She was charged on Wednesday with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. She faces life in prison if convicted.

Ronk goes by the title 'Señora Ronk' in her Spanish classes as Bishop Foley High School. She has been married since 2011, according to her Facebook profile

Ronk could face additional charges. Police are investigating whether sexual contact also took place outside of school grounds in Macomb County. 

Ronk's bail was set at $500,000. She was released Wednesday after posting $50,000 cash on the condition that she wear a GPS tether on her ankle.

Ronk has been married since 2011, but has no children, according to her husband's Facebook profile.

A Facebook page she set up for her Spanish class, Español con Señora Ronk, shows her celebrating Día de los Muertos (The Day of the Dead) in her classroom.

The Archdioceses of Detroit, which runs Bishop Foley High School, sent a letter home to parents informing them of the allegations against the teacher, though the school did not name her.

In a statement, the Archdioceses said: 'Whatever the details or outcome, such allegations are disconcerting and are treated with the utmost seriousness.'
