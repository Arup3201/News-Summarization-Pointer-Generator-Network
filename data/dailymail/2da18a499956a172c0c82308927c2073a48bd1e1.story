The method behind the madness of Hitler's
infamous rousing speeches has been revealed in an album of extraordinary
photographs.

The incredible pictures show the dictator
rehearsing for his hate-filled monologues using a range of bizarre expressions
and hand gestures.

The nine photos were taken by his personal
photographer Heinrich Hoffmann to give the 'showman' Fuhrer an insight into how
he looked to the German public.

Once he saw them, he would vet the
pictures and decide whether to incorporate the various animated movements in
his engagements.

The pictures, taken in the late 1920s,
show Hitler pointing at a pretend audience, raising a clenched fist, opening
his palms as if imploring a crowd to stand up and frowning angrily.

A separate photo shows him in an absurdly
camp pose, wearing lederhosen and leaning against a tree.

The Nazi monster later banned it from
being published for being 'beneath one's dignity'.

Another image has him staring seriously at
the camera wearing an SA cap - which he never wore again upon seeing the
ridiculous pictures.

The SA - or Sturmabteilung - were Hitler's storm troopers, also known as brownshirts, which later became overshadowed by the SS.

The photos, which were never intended to
be seen, survived the war and have now been published alongside a range of portraits
of Hitler, from the chilling to the comical.

The vetoed photos were stored in
Hoffmann's studio until his arrest at the end of the war, whereupon they
disappeared into various archives.

They were later published in his
little-known memoir, Hitler Was My Friend, in the 1950s and have now been
released in English to be seen by the general public.

They capture the meticulous training
Hitler undertook to perfect his famous speeches, and give a rare insight into
his vanity and controlling personality.

Photographer Heinrich Hoffmann (above), who introduced Hitler to his then-studio assistant Eva Braun, survived the war and spent four years in prison for Nazi profiteering. He died in 1957, aged 72

Roger Moorhouse, a historian who wrote the
introduction to the new book, said: 'It makes perfect sense that he would be
doing this.

'We have this image now of Hitler almost
as a buffoon, but he had a lot of charisma and his speeches made people
sincerely believe he would lead them back to greatness.

'He was an absolutely spellbinding public
speaker and these pictures show that it was something he worked very hard on.

'When you listen to his speeches now, he
sounds like a ranting, raving maniac, but we know that it came across in a very
persuasive way.

'These pictures give an important insight
into how he practised. He was a showman and rehearsed his gestures to get a
particular reaction from his audiences.

'He experimented with his own image and
asked Hoffmann to take photographs for him to review. Then he'd look at them
and say "no, that looks silly" or "I'm never doing that again".

'He used Hoffmann as a sounding board, but
never intended the images to be published.

'He was a very modern politician in that way.
He was concerned about how he looked and his public persona.'

Hoffmann, who introduced Hitler to his
then-studio assistant Eva Braun, survived the war and spent four years in
prison for Nazi profiteering. He died in 1957, aged 72.

The book, Hitler Was My Friend by Heinrich
Hoffmann, can now be purchased from Pen & Sword Books and costs Â£19.99.

The Fuhrer and the power of oratory

Standing on a podium before thousands of Nazi party members, Hitler crossed his arms... and waited a full minute before starting to speak.

The audience had already been kept waiting over an hour for his arrival into the hall.

When it came to making speeches, the Fuhrer was a master of manipulation and presentation.

In the early years of his rise to power, he often spoke in Beer Halls - and tailored his style of talking accordingly as the crowds became more inebriated.

He would begin precisely, logically and in a restrained manner.

But as his audience warmed to him - and had drunk more - he would launch into a ranting, raving, almost hypnotic speech style.

Hitler was fascinated by mesmerism and even hired a voice trainer to hone this talent.

By 1932, German production had fallen by half, with 6million unemployed during the depression.

So in order to sway the masses, Hitler would speak of his vision of a 'great national revival'.

And his largest asset was his oratory.

Egon Hanfstaengl, the son of Hitler's foreign press officer, said during a recent documentary, Fatal Attraction Of Hitler: 'He had that ability which is needed to make people stop thinking critically and just emote.

'The ability derived from his readiness to throw himself totally open - to appear bare and naked before his audience, to tear open his heart and display it.'

And he displayed well. In his carefully orchestrated public addresses, with its grand ritual and sense of unity, Hitler gave the people what they wanted.
