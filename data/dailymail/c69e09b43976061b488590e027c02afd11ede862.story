One of the men expelled from Tanzania with Jihadi John is a close associate of ‘the Goebbels of Islamic State’, responsible for horrific videos of beheadings.

Mohammed Emwazi was with German national Marcel Schrodl when they were stopped at the airport in Dar es Salaam in 2009.

Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that German intelligence has linked Schrodl to Denis Cuspert – the rapper whose role making videos for IS has been likened to that of Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels.

Cuspert, who was a rapper under the name Deso Dogg, has appeared in an IS beheading video, holding up the severed head of a victim. 

It is believed he may also have produced the sickening footage of Emwazi murdering British and US prisoners with a knife.

German authorities have linked him to Schrodl, one of the most dangerous Islamists on their radar, who they classify as ‘prone to violence’.

Although he claims to have turned his back on fanaticism, Schrodl is believed to have forged links with Somali terror group Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda affiliate.

When a Mail on Sunday reporter spoke to Schrodl at his home in Dusseldorf about his links to jihadism, he said: ‘I don’t have anything to do with that any more.’ 

Some time later, outside the door of his seedy fourth-floor flat, he appeared flanked by two heavies, who made it plain that it was time for our reporter to leave.

But his denials conflict with information from German intelligence agencies which regard him as a ‘person of interest’ in the ongoing fight against IS.

Emwazi, Islamic convert Schrodl and Londoner Ali Adorus were stopped by the Tanzanian authorities at Dar es Salaam airport as they arrived for what they had claimed was an innocent safari holiday.

Emwazi’s apologists have claimed the men’s detention – ‘on orders from MI6’ – as the first step on his road to radicalisation.

Yet The Mail on Sunday has established that the supposedly strict Muslims were held not because of their political affiliations, but due to their drunken and violent behaviour on a Dutch KLM flight from Amsterdam to Dar es Salaam, according to the Tanzanian government.

Schrodl is connected with some of the vilest figures in the radical Islamic network, most notably fellow convert Cuspert. German intelligence sources say both men were radicalised by Mohammed Mahmoud, the Austrian-born leader of banned Islamist group Millatu Ibrahim.

In September 2013, Schrodl was stopped returning to Germany after a flight from Cairo. A search revealed a secret compartment in his jacket containing a false French driving licence and identity card. In October last year, he was sentenced to a five-month suspended jail sentence.

Adorus, 33, a father-of-one from East London, is in an Ethiopian jail on terrorism offences.
