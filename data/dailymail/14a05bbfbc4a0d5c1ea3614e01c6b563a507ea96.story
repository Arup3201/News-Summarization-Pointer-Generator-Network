A dog which fell down a 30ft mine shaft was pulled out uninjured by rescuers - after being stuck there for nine days.

Collie-cross Peppa slipped down the hole while chasing a scent during a morning walk with owner Audrey Binding.

She returned to the spot every day for a week to look for Peppa and eventually called in a search team from the Four Paws Animal Rescue charity as a 'last-ditch attempt'.

Amazingly, rescuer Simon Wall, 47, managed to find Peppa on a ledge 8ft down the shaft after just two hours of searching - and pulled her out.

It is believed that Peppa - who lost almost 5lbs during her ordeal - survived by drinking water at the bottom of the mine shaft.

Delighted Audrey, of Winscombe, Somerset, said she was 'over the moon' Peppa was found.

She said: 'There had been no sightings for nine days so it was tough to keep my hopes up. I honestly thought the search party would find her dead.

'When I stopped crying, I was just so so pleased to see her I couldn’t stop hugging her. It’s more than a miracle in my books.'

Simon, of Blackwood, Wales, said: 'It looks like Peppa fell right to the bottom of the shaft, but then managed to scramble her way up.

'She was hungry and thirsty, but must have found subterranean water at the bottom, otherwise she would have been dead after nine days.'

Peppa first went missing on the morning of March 2 as she was walked on the Strawberry Line disused train route in North Somerset.

Audrey combed the woods with locals and other dog owners for a week before enlisting the help of Four Paws Animal Rescue.

A group of 13 dog owners and their pets arrived at Banwell Woods, near Sandford, on March 11, splitting off into groups to cover the area.

Property manager Simon, 47, began calling out to his four border collies as he walked them around the woods - and was stunned to hear another dog barking back.

He followed the noise to a 30ft deep and 25ft wide disused mine shaft and spotted Peppa balancing on a ledge 8ft below the surface.

Simon said: 'I tried to reach her, but couldn’t so I tied three dog leads together and secured them to a strong root before lowering myself down.

'I was able to lean out to her and she reached towards me and I pulled her out by her harness. She was wagging her tail like mad.'

Simon called other rescuers with the happy news and walked to Audrey with Peppa and his own dogs, Milo, Ben, Chico and Chipp.

Peppa - who was completely uninjured by her ordeal - wolfed down a meal and water before being reunited with the rest of the search party.

Simon added: 'It was like a lottery win, a £1 million win. Everyone was crying with joy because it was so unexpected.'
