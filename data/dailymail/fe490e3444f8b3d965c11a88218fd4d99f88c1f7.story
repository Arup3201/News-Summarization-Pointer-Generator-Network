Arsene Wenger may have raised an inquisitive eyebrow at this Brighton performance; he will know Arsenal are in for a proper game when they arrive here in the FA Cup on Sunday.

It was a night not befitting a team who had won only three Championship games before the end of December and are still trying to haul themselves away from the relegation zone.

But then again, in Chris Hughton the Seagulls have a manager who is already turning the tide on the south coast. With Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira they have a diminutive figure who is able to unlock at will, and it was he who scored two stunning goals for which Ipswich had no answer.

‘I’m delighted with the performance,’ said Hughton, who sees his side now six points clear of the drop.

‘Joao was excellent. He has quality and somebody who is prepared to work hard. You need to get him on the ball. He’s still young - today would’ve done him the world of good.’

Sam Baldock had given Brighton a lead - unstoppably lashing across Bartosz Bialkowski - before Daryl Murphy’s deft volley levelled for Mick McCarthy’s side three minutes later, his 18th of the campaign. It seemed the visitors, who could’ve gone top with a win, would then turn the screw but Teixeira had other ideas.

Firstly he picked up possession from the impressive Rohan Ince 40 yards from goal, driving purposefully at five defenders, before jinking inside and smashing into the top corner via a deflection.

And if that wasn’t enough, the Portuguese added a third in first-half stoppage time, arriving late to a clever Joe Bennett cut-back and leathering home. It is his first sustained spell away from Anfield, and Brendan Rodgers will like what he is seeing.

McCarthy, meanwhile, did not.

‘I'm not happy about the goals - that isn't like us,’ he said. ‘Our first-half performance wasn’t what I’d expect. Maybe one or two of them are knackered.

‘They're all off until Monday. Go on holiday, have a beer with their mates, whatever.’

Chris O’Grady had chances to pile further misery on McCarthy but fluffed his lines on a number of occasions as Brighton quite rightly looked towards the flamboyant Teixeira for inspiration. They would be advised to do similar when Wenger and Arsenal come to town.

‘He’s just too good for you,’ they sang inside the Amex Stadium and that was no exaggeration.

Ince had a header cleared off the line while Aaron Hughes saw his looping effort tipped over. And they could have been made to pay for those close calls after Freddie Sears slipped underneath David Stockdale in the 78th minute and Murphy almost squeezed in a late equaliser but the eventual difference was a little playmaker from Melwood.
