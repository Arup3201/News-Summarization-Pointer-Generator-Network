Many hotels, especially the most luxurious, now come with free Wi-Fi as standard, but many of us assume that when we connect to these networks, our data is secure.

Security experts have uncovered a threat that specifically targets such networks to steal information and even delete confidential data from visitors.

The so-called Darkhotel campaign is believed to have been active for the past four years and works with ‘surgical precision’ to target even the most secure, and private, networks.

Darkhotel was uncovered by experts from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis team.

The cybercriminals begin by infiltrating hotel web networks, through a variety of methods. They typically target the networks in luxury hotels, and can handpick their victims.

Once it has access to a network, the Darkhotel attackers select a high-powered victim and wait until they connect to the Wi-Fi network, ultimately entering their room number and surname at the login.

When travelling, any network, even semi-private ones in hotels, should be viewed as potentially dangerous, said Kaspersky.

To prevent this, the experts warn that travellers should avoid updating software or clicking files when not on trusted networks.

They should also keep their antivirus software up-to-date, before they leave their home. 

The attackers then trick the person into downloading and installing a so-called backdoor file, which pretends to be an update for legitimate software, such as the Google Toolbar, Adobe Flash or Windows Messenger.

The unsuspecting victim downloads this hotel ‘welcome package’, only to infect his machine with Darkhotel’s spying software.

Once on a system, the backdoor has been, and may be used, to further download more advanced stealing tools such as an advanced keylogger or the Trojan ‘Karba’.

These tools collect data about the system and the anti-malware software installed on it, steals all keystrokes, and hunts for cached passwords in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer.

It also looks for Gmail Notifier, Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo, and Google login credentials, as well as other private information.

The attacks are particularly targetted at successful businessmen and women. 

Attackers are able to acquire sensitive and confidential information, such as intellectual property of businesses that the people represent.

After the operation, the attackers delete their tools from the hotel network and go back into hiding, explained Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.

‘For the past few years, Darkhotel has performed a number of successful attacks against high-profile individuals, employing methods and techniques that go well beyond typical cybercriminal behaviour.

David Riches, technical Director at Airangel, which provides WiFi to hotels including The Ritz London, Malmaison, Radisson BLU and Holiday Inn told MailOnline: 'This story is yet another example of scare-mongery around personal cyber security, that could actually do more harm good.

'Our platform contains customers' guest data within HTTPS secured pages so it cannot be intercepted as it is fully encrypted point to point. 

'Added to this guests can install a mobile Internet Security app that allows them set their own privacy levels and have complete peace of mind that their personal data is safe wherever and whenever they access the web.'

‘This threat actor has operational competence, mathematical and crypto-analytical offensive capabilities, and other resources that are sufficient to abuse trusted commercial networks and target specific victim categories with strategic precision.’

The most recent travelling targets include top executives from the US and Asia including chief executives, senior vice presidents, sales and marketing directors.

Kaspersky did not reveal the names of those affected, however, or the specific hotels. 

‘The mix of both targeted and indiscriminate attacks is becoming more and more common, where targeted attacks are used to compromise high-profile victims, and botnet-style operations are used for mass surveillance,’ added Mr Baumgartner.
