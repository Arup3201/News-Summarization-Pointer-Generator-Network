Her name is Wounda, but her name says it all. In the Congo it means 'close to dying' - and that is exactly how she was found when she was taken in by the Jane Goodall Institute's Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center in the Republic of Congo.

And when she was finally released after being nursed back to health, she repaid the kindness by hugging the well-known animal activist as realised she was free again. 

In the time since Wounda was found, it has taken years of care and dedication to nurse her back to health, until finally she was strong enough to be released into the outdoors once again.

So long! Dr Jane Goodall watches as Wounda begins to explore the island sanctuary and take in her new found freedom

Suffering from a number of illnesses and losing weight fast, it was a race against time to help save her life.

Each morning, Wounda received a liter of milk. The caregivers at the center saw that she was recovering and making good progress.

Eventually, the day came when it was time for her to live her life free from human interference.

She was put into a crate and driven to her new home - a sanctuary site on Tchindzoulou Island in the nearby Kouilou River, the country’s second biggest river after the enormous Congo. 

The waters were calm and dark.  Dr. Rebeca Atencia, head of the Jane Goodall Institute-Congo, kept a careful eye on Wounda inside her box.

It has been 20 years since the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center opened in the Republic of Congo.

Dr.
 Jane Goodall founded the sanctuary to provide care and hope to the 
chimpanzee victims of the illegal commercial bushmeat and pet trades. 

Today,
 many of the chimpanzee residents are adults who need to explore and 
expand their horizons beyond the boundaries of the existing facility. 

Recognizing
 this need, the Jane Goodall Institute put a great deal of effort into 
creating a more natural environment for the Tchimpounga chimpanzees.

It is to this new island sanctuary that Wounda was taken.

New home: Through dense, lush vegetation, Wounda is carried onto the island

River wild: The sanctuary is on an island on Tchindzoulou Island in the nearby Kouilou River

The Jane Goodall Institute was provided the use of Tchindzoulou island by the Congolese government to help create new space for chimpanzees.

The island is more wild than the enclosures at the sanctuary proper and the chimpanzees still have access to the care of staff.

They even have facilities such as a dormitory that gives them a safe place to spend the night.

The journey involved traveling by road on the back of a pick-up and then after 20 minutes of sailing down the river, the group reach a magical wild place: an island composed of hundreds of hectares of pristine and mysterious tropical forest surrounded by river water.

During her journey, Wounda reaches in through the wooden slits in her box.

Dr. Goodall places her hand on top of Wounda. Soon, it is time to let the chimp go.

'This is a really exciting moment for me,' Ms Goodall says to the camera. 'Wounda nearly died but thanks to Dr. Rebeca Atencia she came back from the dead.

Now she has a will to live and is about to come into paradise and became the 15th chimp to be released here.'

The dense forest of Tchindzoulou Island is now home to 15 chimpanzees transferred from the original Tchimpounga sanctuary site over the last eighteen months.

Life has changed dramatically for these chimps. Today, they can roam freely, feeling the wet earth under their feet, smelling the scents from the lush vegetation and listen to the island’s mysterious sounds while they explore their new surroundings.

On the island, there are a variety of trees that offer the chimpanzees large quantities of fresh, ripe fruit. 

To get to the fruit, the chimps often have to climb to great heights, which is a perfect workout for their muscles and brains as they balance on unstable branches.  

One day, the aim is for some of the chimpanzees to be released in Conkouati-Douli National Park in northern Congo.

We've come a long long way togetherL In 2012 Wounda was gravely ill. She was nursed back to health at the JGI Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center

Lazy Days: Wounda relaxes with friends on Tchindzoulou Island a month after her release

As the door to Wounda's box is opened, she scampers around but stays close to her human caregivers.

She stands on top of her box and sits down to take in her new surroundings.

Then, without thinking, she turns and hugs Dr. Goodall in a moving moment of tenderness between human and chimpanzee.

The embrace between the two appears to last for several minutes.

No words are spoken but it seems clear what both are feeling.

Slowly and cautiously, Wounda wonders into the new undergrowth that lays before her.

Dr. Goodall follows her a little way as she watched Wounda munch on the fresh green grass.

The delight on her face is clear to see.

Then, without so much of a look back, Wounda heads off into her new life on Tchindzoulou Island.
