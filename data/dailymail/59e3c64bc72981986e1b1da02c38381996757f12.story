After three 'reem' years of vajazzles, make-ups and break-ups on TOWIE, Sam Faiers dramatically confirmed she is leaving the ITV2 show in an emotional series finale last night.

The blonde star - who was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease - told sister Billie and friends James 'Arg' Argent and Jess Wright that she needed to take some time away from the show to concentrate on her rekindled relationship with former TOWIE star Joey Essex.

But that doesn't mean Sam's success outside of the show is going to be slowing down anytime soon - the 23-year-old has just been snapped up by Fake Bake to be the ambassador of its Beyond Bronze range.

FEMAIL caught up with Sam to find out 
her beauty secrets, summer style tips and plans for the future - which 
is most certainly looking bright.

Glam Sam: Samantha Faiers, who last night announced her departure from TOWIE, has just been unveiled as the face of Fake Bake's Beyond Bronze range so FEMAIL caught up with her to chat all things beauty

The blonde reality TV star is using her fake tan expertise to act as a brand ambassador and educate young girls about the dangers of sun beds.

'I've always used Fake Bake, it's my number one tan and my mum would buy it me for Christmas every year,' she said.

'This range is targetted at a younger audience to steer them away from sunbeds.

'I will be going around some schools in the UK and teaching youngsters to look after their skin by using fake tan.

Pastures new: Sam Faiers confirmed Wednesday night's episode will be her last on TOWIE

'We're thinking of going away and having some spray tan and spray champagne parties. Instead of being a face of it, I'm more like an ambassador and I've always used fake tan so it's a nice job for me to talk about.'

While Sam sports a golden glow as we meet her in the May Fair Hotel, she admits she hasn't always got it right.

'When I first started TOWIE I was rather dark, I used to OTT it! I always think you have to prep your skin, I used to whack it on and wake up streaky,' she said.

Beauty aficionado: Sam, pictured with the new range, says she is a real 'girl's girl' and is obsessed with buying make-up

After much trial and error, Sam says she's finally got it right and crams her make-up bag with plenty of products to keep her looking red carpet-ready.

Opening up her make-up bag, she said: 'I am such a girl's girl, my make-up bag 
is endless. Everytime I'm at the airport, I'm at the MAC counter stocking up, it's ridiculous really.

'My mum
 always asks if I've got enough but there's never enough!'

Sam's hero products include HD brows, MAC eyeshadow and lipsticks, NARS blusher and its Laguna bronzer, which she says is be a summer must-have.

She also loves a good budget buy and swears by Maybelline's Eye Studio Master Precise Ink Pen Eyeliner. 'I used this all throughout Celebrity Big Brother, everyone was using it in the end,' she laughed.

Despite having her make-up routine down to a T, she struggles when styling her hair. 'I'm not very good at my own hair, I usually go to a salon before an event.

'I can do my make-up in an hour, I'm a pro now,' she said.

In an attempt to emulate her all-time beauty and style icon, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Sam has incorporated rosehip oil into her beauty regime.

'I researched Rosie and she swears by it so I bought some and I love it. I put it on my face and eyes before bed and wake up and my skin feels so soft.'

While she's keen to copy Rosie's beauty regime, you won't catch Sam slurping on a green juice like the supermodel anytime soon.

'Rosie loves juices and supplements. In LA it's so easy to grab gluten-free food and smoothies at every corner but in Essex it's not really like that, you've got nice restaurants to indulge in and I do try but I don't drive myself mad.

Good taste: Sam cites Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (right) as her all-time idol and has even been using the supermodel's beloved rosehip oil in an attempt to emulate her

'I like my food but I do eat healthy as well. I love fish and I eat seafood over meat, which helps me.I love a treat day and tea and biscuits has been my downfall ever since I was a little girl and it will never stop, you've got to enjoy it haven't you?'.

As well as her dramatic exit from TOWIE, trim new figure and relationship with Joey Essex, Sam's sophisticated new style has been making headlines, too.

Sam, who describes her style as 'current and girly', said: 'It's really nice to be recognised for my style because when I started TOWIE it was all about the diamonds and the glittery dresses.

'I've been working with a lovely stylist 
called Laurie Hadleigh and it's working out so well. I am so busy so it's 
great that she can put an outfit together for me based on what I like 
and help me accessorise, something I am bad at!

'I love keeping it high street. My fans love affordable fast fashion and I do as well. Don't get me wrong, I love my statement designer pieces like bags and shoes but I love brands like Missguided, too.'

Sam may have been the fashionista of the show but she still rates her former co-stars' style.

'Lauren Pope dresses really well and even though my sister Billie is seven months pregnant, she always looks amazing.

'Over the last year, a lot of the girls have really pushed it in the fashion stakes and everyone's on top of it.

Exfoliate

Don't apply deodorant

Leave skin totally
 fresh

Moisturise hands and feet

Apply it 
in natural light

If you make a mistake, put moisturiser on a cotton pad and 
buff it in

'The girls definitely make more effort than the boys who sometimes turn up to filming scruffy and hungover and I'm like "Come on, this is Essex, we all need to look glamorous and on point"

'Dan dresses like a dancer, he's casual. Charlie is going for that cool Kanye West vibe; they're getting there!,' she said.

Speaking about her fitness regime, Sam revealed that she isn't following in her best friend Lucy Mecklenburgh's footsteps.

'Lucy is doing amazingly well with her fitness company but with me, when it comes to fitness, I don't do it every single day, it's not part of my daily routine.

'I will do it when I'm working towards something and with summer coming, I am getting back into it.

'For me, it's not really about weight loss, it's more about toning so I've been doing squats and sit-ups with my trainer to tone.'

Young love: Sam revealed on last night's TOWIE that she's leaving the show to focus on her relationship with Joey Essex

As she waves goodbye to the bright lights of Romford, nights at Sugar Hut and girly chats with Gemma Collins, Sam says she is excited about the year to come.

'There's so many bits and bobs going on. I've got holidays, some travelling and other fashion and beauty stuff. I am really looking forward to this year.

'In five years time, I'd like Minnie's to be an empire of her own, expand it and make it the next ASOS.

'I'll be an auntie then, maybe I'll have a family of my own. Five years is a long way off, I don't know where I'll be, hopefully on a yacht in LA.'
