One of Britain's most
prolific egg thieves who scoured the country to steal almost 700 eggs from seriously endangered birds was jailed for six months today. 

Despite being
jailed three times previously for identical offences, Matthew Gonshaw, 49, from Bow, east London, donned
climbing equipment to steal entire nests - including
those of ospreys, golden eagles and peregrine falcons. 

Some of the stolen
eggs are believed to have had chicks in them nearly ready to hatch, which would
have been killed as he prepared the shells for display.

Gonshaw targeted more than 170 nests - some repeatedly. He now faces being the first person to also be slapped with an Asbo for the offence

The trophy hunter, who travelled widely around the UK for his hobby, was found with his collection of 697 eggs
stored in specially adapted homemade cabinets.

He also now faces being the first person
to be slapped with an Asbo for the offence. 

Jailing him for the maximum
term, District Judge William Ashworth said: 'This was an ongoing venture that
wasn't going to stop.

'The offence is serious that only a
custodial sentence can be justified because this represented a methodically and
meticulously planned venture targeting rare British birds and placing them in
peril and causing substantial losses to the local community.

Among the eggs found in Matthew Gonshaw's haul:

'It is made
worse by your previous convictions.'

Like many of his 'underground community',
he would make small holes in the shell and blow the eggs to get rid of the contents.

However, many of the eggs were close to hatching and he had to remove chicks - killing the young and damaging the collection.

Gonshaw targeted more than 170 nests, some repeatedly, and his theft of golden eagle and osprey eggs was 'unprecedented'.

Becky Owen, prosecuting, said: 'A
significant number of the eggs had large and untidy holes in them which suggest
that the eggs were taken too late in the incubation and therefore he removed
developing chicks... including from the golden eagles' eggs.

'The egg
thieves will watch a nest over a considerable period to attempt to identify
when they are being laid and it is in fact a lack of skill on the part of the
egg thief that he has got this entirely wrong.'

The eggs will now have to be
destroyed rather than passed on to a Natural History Museum as this would be
seen as an 'achievement' for the egg thief.  

Speaking outside court ,RSPB officer
Mark Thomas said: 'He is one of the most prolific collectors of wild bird eggs
in the UK and he has got a disregard for wild birds, particularly rare ones,
and the people who spend thousands of hours looking after them.

'With the golden eagle eggs in particular,
it was incredibly cruel. He took them about a week from hatching - he basically
removed a live chick... and all he could do was put [the eggs] in a wooden tray and hide them in his home.

'He is obsessive, he can't stop collecting
eggs and he is putting some of the most endangered birds in the UK in peril.'

The balding defendant, who would steal entire clutches, had 45 eggs from Schedule One birds, which are particularly
rare.  

Officers noted how the eggs had been stored and categorised in a professional and organised way. 

Gonshaw admitted six offences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981
at Thames Magistrates Court today.

This
included possession of 652 'ordinary' wild bird eggs, possession of 18 
wild bird eggs from peregrine falcons, dotterels, and merlins, red kites
(a bird of prey that had been
persecuted to extinction in England and has only recently returned as 
the
result of a reintroduction programme) and redwings.

Gonshaw also had
possession of eight osprey eggs - a rare bird. 

He also admitted taking
five golden eagle eggs from Lewis, Scotland, possessing seven golden eagle
eggs, taking 12 avocet eggs (the bird used for the RSPB emblem) from a nesting
site in Two Tree Island, Essex and possessing them at his home, and two charges
of going equipped to take eggs.

His tools to steal the wild birds eggs
included wooden trays, storage containers, books, notebooks, maps, climbing equipment,
clothing, egg blowing tools and photographs.

This is his fifth conviction relating to
his collection.

In April 2001, he was caught raiding a golden eagle's nest in
the outer Hebrides and fined £500.

In 2002, he received a three-month sentence
for stealing rare British species of eggs, but officers were unable to find his
collection.

In 2004, he was jailed for four months and fined £5,000 in Scotland for taking eggs and he was jailed again
for six months in 2005 after being caught with more than 700 eggs.

Benefits claimer Gonshaw - who complained 'It's
a free country, isn't it' - said he funded his excursions by hitch-hiking and
living wild.

Matthew Hood, defending, said: 'He has
been collecting eggs as a hobby since childhood. It is an interest he has never
been able to lose but he has told me today that he wants help.'
