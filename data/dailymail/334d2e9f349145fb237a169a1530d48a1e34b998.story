Flames ripped through a small Wyoming town Tuesday night destroying four buildings containing more than 12 businesses, officials say.

The small, picturesque town of Dubois in Wyoming was ravaged by a fire that ripped through a line of businesses as firefighters fought below-zero temperatures that froze their hoses and other equipment. 

'It was horrendous for them. They were, as usual, heroes,' Mayor Twila Blakeman said, crediting the firefighters with keeping the fire from spreading.

Temperatures plunged to 25 degrees below zero, NBC reports, and residents of the historic town of 1,000 came together, helping business owners salvage what they could from the buildings.

One destroyed building reportedly contained about 10 businesses. A fly fishing shop and a gallery were also burned.

'It was a struggle for firefighters because their equipment was freezing up,' she said.
