Businessman Alan Bond's wife Diana Bliss left a heart-breaking suicide note of apology to her husband and family before taking her life in her luxury home, it was revealed today.

Miss Bliss, 57, told of her sorrow for the stress and pain her struggle with mental illness had caused Mr Bond and her family.

The former London-based theatre producer, who had returned to Australia with her British-born husband three years ago, has fought against years of depression.

She was found dead in the swimming pool at the couple's beach side mansion in Perth at the weekend.

Her
younger brother, 55-year-old Peter Bliss, who revealed details of the 
suicide note today, said that after battling months of depression she 
wrote that she 'just couldn't keep going on as she had'.

Mr Bliss said his sister had tried to take her life twice in the past and had undergone electric shock treatment late last year.

'Sometimes it seemed to be working and other times it didn't,' he said.

'It was as if she was sabotaging herself - as if she didn't want to get better.

It was distressing to see. She was in an extremely fragile state.'

He
also revealed that Miss Bliss had left notes in the past with a similar
tone to the one found at the couple's £3 million home in the Perth 
suburb of Cottesloe.

The note was in his sister's handwriting, he said, and was 'loving and apologetic.'

He
told PerthNow that while he had not seen the note personally 'I know 
she said how wonderful Al (Mr Bond) was and what a beautiful, 
unbelievable husband he had been to her.'

'She just said she couldn't keep going on as she had, especially with all that stress and pain on the family,' he added.

Mr Bond and his wife divided their time between London - where the businessman was born before his parents emigrated with him - and Perth.

Mr Bliss said he had flown to London twice during the past 18 months in a desperate attempt to help his sister and see if he, along with Mr Bond, could bring her 'back from a place no-one wanted her to be.'

The hardest decision he had to make, he said, was to commit his sister to care on one of the occasions he was in London.

It reached the stage where he and Mr Bond had to have her committed to care for a month.

'It was a very difficult time for all of us, but at least we knew she was getting the best care.'

On her release from care, he said, his sister had 'good and bad days'but in general she remained 'very depressed and anxious up to the point when she was 'acutely depressed.'

Last year, said Mr Bliss, his sister had started voluntary electric shock treatment and while it was supposed to have a 70 per cent success rate, he wasn't sure about that.

His daughter Jody Fewster made a brief statement to the media saying her father was too distraught to say anything more on the tragic death of his wife.

'The family is devastated, her (Di’s) friends are devastated and dad just can’t talk at the moment' she said.

'I just really appreciate your interest because she was beautiful but that’s all about we can say at the moment' she added.

Mr Bond is believed to battled desperately to revive his wife, a former air stewardess, and called an ambulance at around 11.30 am.

Ms Bliss, who had worked as a Qantas flight attendant, in public relations and later as a successful theatre producer, married Bond in 1995 after he had been discharged as a bankrupt.

He was divorced from his first wife, Eileen, three years earlier.

Bond, 73, who emigrated with his parents from London to Australia in 1950, began as a signwriter but went on to become a multi-millionaire whose investments in airships, property, breweries and diamond mines enabled him to bankroll challenges for the America’s Cup, the premier international yacht race.

In 1983, his Australia II Syndicate won the trophy, which had been  held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851.

In 1987, Bond controversially bought Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for £36 million – at the time the highest price paid for a single painting.

But the purchase was subsidised by a substantial loan from auctioneer Sotheby’s, which Bond failed to repay. Art experts suggested it may have been a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate the value.

After his empire collapsed, Bond was declared bankrupt in 1992 with personal debts of £1.2 billion.

He was jailed for seven years in 1997 after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in the Bell Resources company to siphon off more than £800 million into the coffers of his Bond Corporation.

He served four years in jail and since then he has worked with his son, Craig, to build up a new fortune in oil and diamonds.

By 2008, Bond was said to be worth about £170 million.
