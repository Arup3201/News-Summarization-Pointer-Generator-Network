Bacary Sagna has hit back at critics who labelled him greedy when he quit Arsenal for Manchester City by saying: 'It's not about money – I wanted to boost my career.'

The French full-back has finally joined City after months of wrangling, having turned down offers from Arsenal to renew his contract, which ends this month.

And after helping France through to the last 16 of the World Cup in Wednesday night's goalless draw with Ecuador in Rio, Sagna hit back at the rumours he had been trying to simply hike up his wages at Arsenal, pointing out that he had been on the same deal at the Emirates for the past six years.

All smiles: Sagna has ended a seven-year spell with Arsenal to sign a three-year £150k-per-week deal at City

Sagna is free to join City when his contract runs out on June 30 and he said: 'I am a City player.'

But he was keen to clarify why he turned down Arsene Wenger's offers to stay at Arsenal.

'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said.

'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money.

'For people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time.

'It was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a lot of respect for Arsenal.

'It’s not easy to read every day things which are wrong most of the time. I told my family to keep away from speculation and I stayed focused.'

Tearful exit: Sagna's last game for Arsenal was in their 3-2 FA Cup final victory against Hull City in May

High note: The FA Cup victory was the only trophy Sagna won during his seven-year spell at Arsenal

And although he finally won his first trophy with Arsenal when they beat Hull in the FA Cup final last month, he admits going to join Manuel Pellegrini will give him the chance of Premier League and Champions League glory.

'It is an exciting time for me and my career. I think we have a good team with City and we can do great things.

'Arsenal made me grow up as a player and as a man as well. We finally won a trophy, but it’s not even about that because Arsenal have a quality.

'It’s just that, personally, I wanted a boost. I needed to start again.'

And Sagna is not worried about competing with Argentinian star Pablo Zabaletta for the right-back position. 'I know they have a very good right-back in Zabaleta and I will have to fight to find some time on the pitch. But I’m looking forward to it.'

Before joining up with his new team-mates, Sagna believes he can help France win the World Cup, with the experience of manager Didier Deschamps a decisive factor.

The French crashed out of the past two tournaments after internal rows between players and staff, but Sagna says Deschamps has brought harmony to the camp – and has the experience of winning the World Cup in 1998.

He said: 'We have started very well, so we have to be ambitious.

'In the past we were maybe too arrogant, too confident. Sometimes it’s good to start from the bottom. We’ve worked hard as a team for a few years and today we are here. We have managed a good start to the World Cup and we want to go to the end.

'The coach has been a player himself, he's been a world champion so he knows how to manage and lead a team with feeling.

'At the moment I’m not thinking about anything else, I’m giving my maximum to go to the World Cup final.'
