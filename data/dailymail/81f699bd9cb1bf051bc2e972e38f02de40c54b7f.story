A wannabe glamour model who received a free NHS breast enlargement has hit out at a decision to stop her taxpayer-funded taxi trips to take her children to school.

Josie Cunningham, 23, who is heavily pregnant with her third child, started receiving the £6,000-a-year state-funded transport after complaining about the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport.

However, Leeds City Council has now decided to axe the daily luxury – much to the annoyance of the expectant mother who once said: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’

She said today: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.'

Ms Cunningham, 23, shot to notoriety last year when she had an NHS-funded operation - worth £4,800 - to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest

Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest.

She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for a sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother.

Despite the controversy, she continued to soak up public funds by making the most of the state-funded taxis which drove her and her two children, aged three and six, the two-and-a-half mile journey to and from the local school, twice a day.

She received the free transport on health grounds, after claiming the stress of unwanted ‘negative attention’ was giving her anxiety attacks.

The journey, which she has been doing since May at a cost of £150-a-week, would only cost around £30-a-week by bus.

It could be part of the reason why Leeds City Council has now decided to put an end to the twice-daily trips.

Ms Cunningham, from Leeds, said the council initially tried to halve the bill by taking her children to school with a chaperone – but pulled it altogether when she complained.

She told The Sun: ‘They told me that if I wasn’t on the journey, the cost would be reduced.

‘I refused to let my kids get into a car with someone I’ve never met. I kicked off and they said the taxis would stop.’

Ms Cunningham said she would be appealing the decision and would even consider moving her children to a different school.

It comes while she is heavily pregnant with her third child, who she fell pregnant with while working as a £1,000-a-night escort.

She has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is and has also admitted to considering having the unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother.

She said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy.

It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which she has become infamously known for.

The operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk.

After the enlargement, Ms Cunningham claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and enraged the nation further by claiming the NHS should pay for a reduction.

She then tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant.
