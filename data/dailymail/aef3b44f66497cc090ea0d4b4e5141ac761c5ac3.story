Is it a car? Is it a plane? No it's a 'future cycle'. 

Michigan-based design team Rachael and Cameron Van Dyke have created futuristic bikes that don't require a scrap of Lycra. That's because in the Zeppelin, riders can relax and let the electric motor do some of the work.

While comfortably sat on mahogany and leather seats, protected from the elements,  the Cyclone appears to be closer to a car than a bicycle.

But you won't find any horse power under its bonnet  which is pedal power only. 

 From the outside they appear to be mini cars, but underneath reveals there is no big engine, just a small electric motor and two sets of pedals

Design team The Future People - married couple Rachael and Cameron Van Dyke - also created the beetle-like Zeppelin (pictured)

Both are part of The Future Cycle project- blurring the lines between bicycles and cars.

'We wanted to see just how far we could push the legal definition of bicycle to provide a car-like experience with very low energy input,' says designer Cameron Van Dyke of The Future People.

Their project 'Future Cycles', unveiled at this month's Detroit Auto Show, consists of human-powered vehicles that blur the lines between bicycles and cars - creating a hybrid alternative.

The first was the three-wheeled Zeppelin-  is a hybrid powered by two riders in combination with a 750w electric rear motor. Made from polycarbonate and aluminium it weighs just 270lbs and is able to achieve a cruising speed of 25mph on flat ground, but is still considered a 'bicycle'.

The second has been created as a luxury vehicle. The Cyclone is four-seated human-powered vehicle, able to carry cargo. 

Like the Zeppelin it combines boat building techniques with the latest bike technology, but it also aims to create a luxury feel with an interior of fine leather, mahogany and brushed aluminium.

The team, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, are hoping the concept vehicles will begin a discussion about American car culture.  

The Zepplin is powered by two riders in combination with a 750w electric rear motor and achieves a cruising speed of 25 mph on flat ground, yet is still completely, legally considered a 'bicycle'. It weighs just 270lbs, thanks to being made from polycarbonate and aluminum

Rachael and Cameron Van Dyke said they had wanted to see just how far we could push the legal definition of bicycle to provide a car-like experience with very low energy input

Like the Zeppelin, the Cyclone was constructed with boat building techniques, and combined with modern bicycle technology 

The Cyclone is a 4-seat  luxury vehicle with an interior of fine leather and mahogany, powered by two riders and can also carry cargo

The pedal-drive SUV features brushed aluminum details and is claimed to be an 'indispensable' part of a sustainable luxury lifestyle

 The design team said they had wanted to explore and test alternative value systems related to transportation
