Andres Iniesta wants Manchester City to ‘suffer’ in tomorrow’s Champions League tie in the Nou Camp.

Barcelona lead 2-1 from the first leg at the Etihad and are expected to progress to the quarter-final of the competition.

Iniesta said: ‘We play in a comprehensive manner, we want ball possession so that they suffer. We need to find our superior skills and minimise their potential. We want to control what goes on at every moment.

‘In a season there are different moments, I am not there in Manchester City with the team and this players but from a distance, as an opposition player, my perception is that they are a sound team.

‘They are a team with top quality players, it is difficult opposition.’

Iniesta also admitted Barcelona will have to pay special attention to their former midfielder Yaya Toure after he returns from suspension.

Iniesta said: ‘He is very important for them, he is very powerful physically, he has important qualities because of all his skills. We will try to minimise his potential.’ 

Iniesta's team-mates seemed to be enjoying themselves ahead of City's visit with a lively training session on Tuesday with Neymar in particular acting the joker.

The Brazil star was seen laughing with team-mates throughout, and gave fellow striker Luis Suarez a kick up the backside after the Uruguayan had taken a tumble during one exercise.

But Iniesta insisted that his team-mates are taking Wednesday's game very seriously, and are not letting next week's Clasico, or talk of a potential treble, cloud their mines.

'It is true that after tomorrow we have a very important match on Sunday against our main opponents in La Liga in Real Madrid, but we don't think beyond tomorrow,' he added.

'It's very important we are totally concentrated on tomorrow.'
