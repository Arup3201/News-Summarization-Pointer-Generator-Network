Demba Ba has been given the No 9 shirt by his new club Besiktas after completing a move from Chelsea for a fee of around £8million. 

The striker flew to Istanbul on Wednesday morning, before being unveiled by the Turkish giants in the afternoon.

The 29-year-old tweeted a message in Turkish saying, 'I'm here @Besiktas!', and shortly after he was unveiled with the club's No 9 shirt.

'The interest shown by the fans and the new stadium project won me over,' said the Senegalese striker.

'I'm very happy to be here, all that is left is a few formalities, I will undergo a medical and sign the contract.

'I am excited to be here and can't wait to start playing.

'I want to showcase my talent to the fans as soon as possible, this is a huge club and I want to become a part of it.

'I want to thank the fans for their warm welcome and I am sure we are going to establish a great relationship.'

Besiktas president Fikret Orman gave Ba a tour of Besiktas' new stadium project.

'Ba
 is a player we all believe in, we put in a lot of time and effort to 
complete the transfer to the best of our interests,' Orman said.

'The transfer is within our budget and we are delighted to have completed the move.'

Orman confirmed on Monday that the club had negotiated a deal for Ba for 
slightly lower than Chelsea's £10million asking price.

Ba looked destined to leave
 Stamford Bridge after a season spent as third-choice striker behind Samuel 
Eto'o and Fernando Torres, and with Diego Costa's £32million arrival 
imminent.

Ba spent 
much of last season as Chelsea's third choice option up front but had a 
decent end to the season, scoring game-winning goals against Paris St 
Germain, Swansea and Liverpool.

Chelsea
 signed Ba from Newcastle for £7million in January 2013. He also spent 
time at West Ham and Hoffenheim before moving to Stamford Bridge.
