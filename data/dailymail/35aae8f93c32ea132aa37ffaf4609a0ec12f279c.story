An elaborate planning application for a £5.5m seven-bedroom mansion is expected to be given the go-ahead by council officials, even though the owners spend most of their time abroad.

The plans for the 'Iceberg Home' underneath the property in Wimbledon include a gym, home cinema, games room and sauna, as well as an adjoining glass tunnel which will lead to a swimming pool pavilion at the bottom of the garden.

The controversial application has been 'highly recommended' by planning officials at Merton Council, despite the fact the owners only spend part of the year in the house, splitting their time between the UK and Switzerland.

A residents association in Wimbledon Village have condemned the plans fearing the construction would cause constant noise and could encourage others in the area to take on similar projects.

The Parkside Residents Association said 
with basement conversions becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to 
so-called 'Iceberg Homes', the borough council must be vigilant and ensure there 
is 'robust supervision' of all the submitted applications.

Sue Cooke, chairwoman of the association, said: 'This has been happening in Kensington and Chelsea for some time now. There are now limits to how deep you can build.

'It is just that suburban authorities have not seen it so much.

'We
don't object to the principle of the basement under the garden, but if 
this is allowed without adequate supervision it will set a precedent to 
others.

'Most of these houses are more than 100 years old and construction could impact on neighbours' houses.

'There are conditions in the application which normally have to be met for permission to go ahead, but no recommendations have been made.

'For example, the document says permission will be granted if noise from the ventilation is kept to a minimum, but it does not say how it can be done.

'The system should not work like that.

Plans: The tunnel, drawn at the bottom of the sketch, would be 88ft long and would require the whole rear garden of the property to be excavated

The owners of the property are 
attempting to excavate almost their entire garden and build an enormous 
extension underneath.

They 
were granted planning permission to build a swimming pool in February 
2012, but have now upgraded their plans to include the enormous underground 
structure.

Even though 
they currently spend part of their lives abroad, they are expected to 
move back into the property permanently when the building work is finished.

The glass-covered link between the existing house and the pool pavilion would be 88ft long and 11ft wide.

A
path leading from the house to the pool pavilion would be constructed 
above the underground tunnel and grass would be re-seeded on the surface.

The proposals are set to be accepted despite planning permission being refused for a similar swimming pool pavilion to be built in February 2011.

The plans were rejected on the grounds the structure would be 'detrimental to the character and appearance of the locally listed building and that the pool building was of excessive height.'

The application concluded by saying: 'The proposed pool pavilion and associated basement link and provision of a basement beneath the existing house is considered to be acceptable in design terms and the proposal would preserve the character and appearance.'

Merton Council were approached for comment but said they would not comment before the decision is made.

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich was 
famously granted permission to link three adjoining grade II-listed 
buildings in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, through a vast network of underground
tunnels at a cost of £10m.
