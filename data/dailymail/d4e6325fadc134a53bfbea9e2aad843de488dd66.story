Rescue workers have begun searching for bodies in the burnt-out remains of homes devastated by wildfires in the Australian state of Tasmania.

Many of the 100 people who were declared missing as the fires raged have now been accounted for, but authorities still fear that search teams could find casualties in the areas affected.

And while the Tasmanian fires appear to have largely died down, other areas of the country are bracing themselves for the possibility of new blazes - with the conditions in New South Wales described as the most dangerous in the state's history.

Tasmanian police commissioner Scott Tilyard said no casualties had yet been reported, but it would take time before officials were certain that no one had died in the blazes that have razed 50,000 acres of forests and farmland across southern Tasmania since Friday.

On that day, the island state saw its highest temperatures since records began as the thermometer hit 107F (42C).

Mr Tilyard added that 11 teams were searching ruins in places including the small town of Dunalley, east of the state capital of Hobart, where around 70 homes were destroyed.

'Until we've had the opportunity to do all the screening that we need to do at each of those premises, we can't say for certain that there hasn't been a human life or more than one human life lost as a result of these fires,' he said.

Three fires continued to burn out of control in southern Tasmania and in the north west today.

Video footage broadcast on Channel Seven showed the horrific moment a volunteer firefighter stood and watch a wildfire consume his own brother's home in the town of Murdunna.

Knowing there was nothing he could do to help, Aaron Millar filmed the house burn to the ground and recorded a message to his brother Luke.

'I'm really sorry Luke but I couldn't get into it mate,' he said. 'There was fire going everywhere and I just couldn't get down the road, I'm really sorry cobber.'

Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who flew to Tasmania today, warned that New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, was about to move into a period of extreme heat tomorrow when the wildfire risk would be high.

'We live in a country that is hot and dry and where we sustain very destructive fire periodically,' she said.

'Whilst you would not put any one event down to climate change... we do know over time that as a result of climate change we are going to see more extreme weather events and conditions.'

New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said more than 90 wildfires were blazing across the state today and warned that conditions would worsen.

'It is going to be very hot and very dry. Couple that with the dryness of the vegetation, the grassland fuels, the forest fuels and those strong winds that are expected tomorrow,' he said.

The temperature across much the state was expected to reach 113F (45C) while winds were expected as high as 50mph.

Wildfires are common during the Australian summer. In February 2009, hundreds of fires across Victoria killed 173 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes.
