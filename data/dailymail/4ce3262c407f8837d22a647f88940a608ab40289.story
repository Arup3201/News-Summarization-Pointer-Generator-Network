What started as a childhood obsession with trains has led to a 49-year-old man spending nearly a third of his life in jail for habitually pretending to be a subway driver.

Darius McCollum has been arrested 29 times for driving trains on the subway, stealing buses and pretending to be a conductor and railway worker.

'I've always loved trains, ever since I can remember. I had the whole subway map memorized by the time I was 8,' McCollum said.

McCollum, who has spent 18 years in prison, has been at Rikers Island jail since his last arrest in 2010 for stealing a Trailways bus which he used to drive a unwitting airline crew to JFK Airport on.

While the case may be familiar to him, McCollum and his family hope the outcome at the trial will be different this time.

Attorney Sally Butler believes McCollum's actions are the result of uncontrolled impulses, a byproduct of what was, until recently, called Asperger's syndrome but is now considered an autism spectrum disorder.

Obsession: Darius McCollum has spent 18 years in jail because of his love of trains

With the driving force behind his obsession pinpointed, the district attorney's office has taken a different approach.

McCollum pleaded guilty to stealing the bus on Thursday, but instead of being sentenced to 15 years as a habitual offender, he will get two and a half to 5 years, and voluntarily undergo cognitive behavioral therapy.

'I really do want to change. I have motivation and people behind me - I think I can do it this time,' he told the Associated Press from jail.

McCollum presents a confusing challenge 
for the criminal justice system. He is not violent. He just drives the 
routes, fixes broken tracks and works alongside other transit employees 
without an official job.

But, as prosecutors have said, he could cause 
an accident or injure someone.

'I just love everything about [the subway].' he told the Wall Street Journal.

'I love the atmosphere, I love the lights, I love the signals. I love the fact that it's moving all the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There's nothing negative I can say about the transit system.'

The possibility that McCollum may have Asperger's was raised by a previous lawyer about ten years ago. However, before he could be evaluated he was sentenced by a judge, who dismissed he had the disorder after reading about it online, according to AP. 

Since that sentence, the disorder has been diagnosed.

'I knew I was different from people, but I didn't realize what was making me different,' he said.

His arrests sound vaguely like tall tales where he plays the well-meaning hero. In the most recent case, he claimed to have been hired by Trailways to pick up flight attendants after a driver failed to show up.

McCollum's mother has blamed the attention he receives for his crimes as further encouraging him.

In 1981, when he was 15, he took over the controls of a subway train, allegedly after the driver became sick.

Alternative transport: The Asperger's sufferer also loves buses and has been arrested several times for driving off in them

He drove the E train for six stops from 34th Street Penn Station before being caught. 

His 87-year-old mother, Elizabeth, said 
her son relished the publicity surrounding his first case and came away 
believing he had done the right thing, according to the Wall Street 
Journal.

1981: Arrested after driving an E train filled with passengers from 34th Street to the World Trade Center, aged 15.

1983: Impersonated a subway worker.

1985: Arrested for unauthorized use of a subway repair truck and for driving a city bus in Queens.

1986: Caught stealing a MTA vehicle.

1990: Admits stealing 13 buses over six months and driving them around the city.

1996: Caught sneaking on board a subway train wearing a Transit Authority vest and shirt.

2000: Arrested sneaking into the control tower of the 57th Street station in Manhattan.

2004: Caught trying to take a 60-ton Bombardier M-7 from Long Island.

2006: Parole violations for buying a MTA badge and construction helmet.

2008: Arrested for impersonating an MTA worker at the Columbus Circle subway station.

2008: Arrested at Penn Station for impersonating a federal agent.

2010: Caught driving a stolen bus on the Van Wyck Expressway.

Although the charges were dropped, it started the cycle he has been in for years. McCollum has never held a steady job. He took the civil service exam to work for the Metropolitan Transit Authority but did not pass

It would not have mattered anyway, an MTA spokesman said. 'We would not hire anyone who has previously stolen one of our trains.'

Further arrests came in 1983, for 
impersonating a subway worker; in 1985 for unauthorized use of a subway 
repair truck and for driving a city bus in Queens; and in 1986 for 
stealing another MTA vehicle.

In 1990 he admitted to stealing 13 buses in six months, despite not being caught on each occasion.

'I was just providing a service, volunteering my services and doing good deeds,' he said.

Mrs McCollum worries about the attention her son's actions attract. She moved to North Carolina more than two decades ago to try to keep her son away from the tracks - but to no avail. 

'He needs help is what he needs,' she said.

When she heard of his latest arrest for stealing a bus she told the Daily News she was not surprised.

'He
loves trains more than anything else - buses are his second choice,' 
she said. 'He loves planes, too, but he hasn't been able to get on one 
of those yet.'

Michael John Carley, who founded the nonprofit Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership where McCollum used to attend support group meetings, said no programs exist for autism-spectrum people who get in trouble with the law.

Unlike a drink-driver who can avoid jail by going to rehab, McCollum's only option has been jail.

'All of us who have been charged with helping him, we're the ones who have failed him,' Mr Carley said. 'People take one look at him, at his demeanor and his smarts, and they think he should know better. They don't understand because the disorder isn't really understood in this context.'

Stop: McCollum's last arrest came after he drove a bus load of airline crew to JFK airport. He was caught as he returned the bus to the depot

His current attorney said it was up to McCollum to get better - or be rearrested and face a longer sentence.

'If I went to a jury trial and argued mental illness, we'd win, but the problem is, they put you in the mental hospital, they keep you there until cured,' she said. 'This can't be cured. It can only managed.'

There is hope in sight however. McCollum has said he no longer wants to operate trains because they have become too computerized.
