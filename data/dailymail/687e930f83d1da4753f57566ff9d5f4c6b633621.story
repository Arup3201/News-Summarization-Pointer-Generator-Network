A Liberal Democrat councillor has been accused of holding sex parties hosted by a dominatrix at his home.

David Fuller is said to have charged guests a £15 entry fee as a contribution to soft drinks and a buffet.

The gatherings are supposedly hosted by a Mistress Sarah every month at his three-bedroom detached home in Fareham, Hampshire, and involve scantily-clad women of all ages and men in black leather.

The 12-hour parties reportedly begin at around 9pm and include sex games involving ropes, chains and electrical equipment. They are said to have been held for around a year.

Potential guests are sent invitations via a social networking site for people who enjoy an ‘alternative lifestyle’.

At one party it was claimed that a woman had bubble-wrap taped to her back before being whipped by four men, while a crowd of around 20 looked on.

Fareham council is investigating whether the parties have breached licensing or planning regulations.

Mr Fuller, the deputy chairman of Portsmouth council’s licensing committee, told the Southern Daily Echo, which carried out the undercover investigation: ‘I don’t do anything illegal, but I’d rather not carry on this conversation.’

When contacted again he said: ‘No mate, I am not talking at the moment, no comment.’

On the council website, Mr Fuller states that he is a freemason and works as the manager of a care home.

He adds: ‘I very much enjoy being on the licensing committee, meeting members of the public, and engaging in local issues.’

'Personal matter': Mr Fuller is a Liberal Democrat member of the city council in Portsmouth

Sean Woodward, the Conservative leader of Fareham, said he would ask his planning and licensing officers to investigate the councillor’s property – but admitted that there had been no complaints.

‘We do not have any such premises [for sex parties] in Fareham, so I would want to see if it is a breach of licensing or planning,’ he said. ‘I will certainly have to investigate now that I know it is out there.

‘If [a sex party venue] exists it needs to be properly licensed, and it could have its licence refused if it is in breach of planning or licensing controls.’

David Williams, Portsmouth council’s chief executive, said: ‘As this is a personal matter, it’s not for us to discuss further.

‘There is a code of conduct councillors are expected to adhere to, but this does not strictly apply to their behaviour in a private capacity.

‘If we do receive a complaint about the conduct of a councillor then it will be investigated by the governance, audit and standards committee.’
