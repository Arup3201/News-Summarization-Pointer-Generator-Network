When guests are splashing out more than $43,000 (£27,000) for a week's holiday, it seems only right hotels reward them with some amazing perks.

A night at the $5,947 (£3,697) Ritz-Carlton Suite in New Orleans, for instance, comes with its very own hangover concierge who will provide water, snacks and massages for tired guests who have partied too hard. 

From complimentary super cars from the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills - where a premier suite costs over $19,000 (£12,000) for a week - to arrival by paraglider at the $1,800- (£1,147) a-night four-star Six Senses Hideaway in Oman, there’s a world of luxe treatment on offer for those who have the cash to spend.

The treats are highlighted in a new infographic - '11 hotel perks you won't believe exist' - compiled by Hotels4u.

In at number four is the sunshine butler for those who stay in the master suite  ($345/£215-a-night) at four-star The Club & Hotel Spa, Jersey. He'll help rub in sun lotion, and even polish sunglasses.

And instead of being woken up rudely by the housekeeping crew, an in-room body sensor in the Grand Suite at $1,280- (£794) a-night Hotel 1000, Seattle lets travellers sleep peacefully as staff are alerted to their presence in the room. 

Book a $19,000- (£12,000) a-week stay in the Dream House of the Namale Resort & Spa in Fiji and they’ll throw in a ‘kidnapping service’ where staff whisk guests away to a secret waterfall for a romantic picnic.

Pet lovers should book a stay at the $481- (£299) a-night grand suite in Hotel Monaco, Portland where a pet psychic helps guests improve their relationship with their pets.

Need a good night's sleep? Book a stay at the $500- (£325) a-night Terrace Suite in The Benjamin New York where the sleep concierge reccomends NASA designed pillows. Or if it's waking up that's troublesome then Gaylord Opreyland Resort & Convention Centre in Nashville's celebrity wake up call might just do the trick.  

But nothing beats the Manta Ray Hot Phone at the $2,900- (£1,816) a-night Four Seasons Maldives where, as soon as manta rays have been spotted, guests are sped off on a private speedboat to view the graceful creatures.
