A Texas teen celebrating her birthday opened an iPad her mother purchased at Walmart only to discover that it had been replaced with a stack of notepads.

Walmart now says it's a case of 
fraud committed by a clever crook who purchased the iPad and then returned it after swapping the contents with notepads and carefully resealing the box to resemble factory packaging.

'Unfortunately it resulted in an innocent customer falling
victim to a scam artist’s greed,' a Walmart spokesperson said.

Texas mom Bonni Linden purchased this iPad (pictured) for her daughter's 15th birthday and later found the iPad had been replaced with a stack of notepads

THIS is what Linden and her daughter really wanted, not a box full of writing notepads.

Thirty minutes after the iPad purchase, the teen opened her gift and found the notepads.

“I thought they were joking,” Courtney Akers, 15, told  KHOU 11 News. “And they weren’t.”

Even though the box had been sealed in plastic, someone had replaced the iPad with a stack of notepads, giving the box the weight and feel of a real iPad.

Courtney Akers (left) and her mom were turned away from Walmart after they tried to return the bogus iPad box.

The family went back to the store, but left frustrated two hours later when the store manager failed to resolve the issue.

“I explained I wouldn’t have done that, and that we do not have an iPad,” 
mom Bonni Linden told reporters. “She was just saying she has never seen it happen before and she 
couldn’t help us.”

WalMart said the company is working with police on the investigation.

'We have reviewed our surveillance video to see if we can find out
who is responsible for this and we are sharing that information with local law
enforcement in hopes that whoever is behind this is held responsible for their
selfish acts,' the rep said.

Walmart is sending Linden a new iPad for her daughter, along with a formal apology.

A Walmart rep said they do not know if there are other bogus boxes out there.
