Looking to the future: Louise Robinson says pupils will learn via Skype and video games in the future

A new breed of ‘Star Trek school’ will allow pupils to play video games and learn from their comfort of their homes using web-based lessons and Skype, the leader of the country’s private girls’ schools predicted today.

Britain’s school system is failing to keep up with 21st century technology and must modernise to equip pupils with the skills they will need in future, according to Louise Robinson.

She said computer games such as ‘immune attack’ – where players attempt to stop the body being taken over by a virus – could be used to assess factual knowledge as well as decision-making and logical thinking.

Seeing a character killed off in a game was ‘not a failure’, she insisted. Pupils learned determination and perseverance as they tried new techniques to overcome the setback, she said.

Schools in future could also teach pupils topics such as Pythagoras’ theorem at home through internet connections and then reinforce them in class, in a reversal of the traditional approach of school-based lessons followed by homework.

Mrs Robinson, president of the Girls’ Schools Association, shared her vision of how schools could prepare children for life in the 2020s in a keynote speech.

The self-confessed Star Trek fan and ‘techie’ said many technological advances foreshadowed by the cult sci-fi series had already materialised, such as mobile phones, speaking directly to a computer and light sensors.

‘The Star Trek society is upon us – but where is the Star Trek school?’ she said.

‘We already know we are in a situation where our school-based provision lags behind the technology of the 21st century.

The way forward? Children could be learning from home via Skype in the future

‘The question we must ask ourselves, as education leaders, is what are we going to do about it?

‘We must do more to prepare our pupils for the world as it is and as it will be.’

Her call came days after Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans for a new hi-tech computer science curriculum with the same status as traditional subjects.

Pupils as young as seven could be required to learn to ‘code’ or write computer programs.

But Mrs Robinson, head of Merchant Taylor’s Girls’ School in Crosby, Liverpool, said many of Mr Gove’s other proposed reforms to public exams and the school curriculum were ‘taking us back to a bygone era’.

She insisted she was not calling for ‘immediate wholesale change’ but more ‘creative curriculum decisions’.

‘If you watch a child playing a game, whether it is a technological game or not, they learn by doing, failing, trying new pathways and techniques,’ she told the GSA’s annual conference in Liverpool.

Learning via games: Mrs Robinson says video games such as immune attack can be educational

‘Being killed off in a game is not a failure. Most children will continue with determination, and persevere for a long time; and before you think it's about ‘shoot and kill’, have you watched an 8 year old playing “build a zoo”.’

Outlining how the ‘classroom of the future’ might look, she said: ‘Will we be able to use online/remote delivery of lessons with local support via Skype or use the gaming world?’

Games involving decision-making and role-playing could help pupils develop problem-solving skills, she said.

In ‘immune attack’ for example ‘the teachers can see how well the facts are known by students as they can assess whether the game is approached with logic or by a random approach’.

But she added that, although schools in the future ‘may have to avatars or virtual teachers’, teachers will still be needed ‘in some form or other’.

‘Nothing else provides quite the same subtlety and effectiveness of communication our body language and immediate presence can provide.’

In a wide-ranging speech, Mrs Robinson also insisted that private schools should not be forced to share their facilities and expertise with their state school ‘competition’.

Fee-paying middle-class parents were already faced with ‘increasing’ charges due to the growing weight of regulation and red tape private schools are coming under.

It was ‘beyond the pale’ to expect schools to share facilities and their ‘DNA’ – such as their expertise in running Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) – with state school parents who had decided against sending their children private schools.

David Cameron and Mr Gove have both urged private schools to sponsor state-funded academies and share resources and facilities.

Mrs Robinson said private schools were prepared to help, but on their own terms.

‘Many of us happily do this already with a wide variety of schools on our own terms, but when we are squeezed between the tightening rules and regulations being imposed upon us, the rising cost of our provision and the ability of middle-class parents to pay our increasing fees, it seems a bit beyond the pale to ask if we will share aspects of our unique selling point with local competition,’ she said.

‘And competition it is; why should my school offer its expertise and experience to parents who could have sent their children to my school, but chose not to, or to a Government who criticises my morality?’
