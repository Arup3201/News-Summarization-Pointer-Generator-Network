The summer transfer window in England may be closed until the new year but there are still plenty of stars who are free to a good home.

These unattached players can be picked up at any time and plenty of Premier League clubs will have their eyes on a bargain.

Arsenal, for instance, still have room for two non-homegrown players to be added to their 25-man squad so Arsene Wenger may yet look to add to it, with experienced defender Mario Yepes potentially worth a punt. 

There are more than that, of course, and here are Sportsmail's best picks of the free agents...

Free to a good home: Ronaldinho and Victor Valdes lead the potential free transfer signing

Victor Valdes 

Despite an injury plagued couple of years, Victor Valdes remains a top-class keeper.

The Spaniard left Barcelona in the summer after 14 years, winning a host of trophies including six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues.

The 32-year-old, who earlier in the summer failed a medical at Monaco due to a serious knee injury, is being strongly linked with a move to Liverpool and could end up there on a one-year deal.

A possible spanner in the works is that he won't be fit until December.

Shot stopper: Valdes established himself as one of the top keepers in the world during his time at Barcelona

Ronaldinho

Despite his advancing years, who wouldn't want to see the magical Brazilian in the Premier League for one last hurrah?

The former Ballon d’Or winner is without a club since leaving Atletico Mineiro in July, and has been linked with a move to Benfica all summer as well as a host of other clubs from the newly-formed Indian Super League.

The 34-year-old remains a free agent though and we all still hope to see those silky skills and that toothy smile in England's top flight before he does eventually call it a day.

Silky: Ronaldinho, two-time world player of the year, still has plenty of skills in his locker

Mario Yepes

Yepes may be 38 now but he is showing no signs of slowing up just yet after playing every minute at the World Cup, where he captained Colombia to the quarter-finals.

He predictably has a wealth of experience after spells with River Plate, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan but after leaving Serie A side Atalanta at the end of last season he is now a free agent and is reportedly keen on a move to England.

With Arsenal a defender or two light, Wenger could do a lot worse than offer Yepes a short-term deal as he still seems more than capable of performing at the highest level.

Experience: Mario Yepes could be an excellent addition to Arsene Wenger's squad for the long season ahead

Hugo Almeida

The former Portugal striker left Besiktas in the summer after three years in Istanbul, scoring 25 goals in the process.

He has already attracted interest from newly-promoted Leicester this summer, as well as West Ham, Sunderland and Hull.

Almeida, still only 30, could prove to be a useful addition to a mid-table Premier League side and comes with minimal risk too.

Pedigree: Hugo Almeida is only 30 but he has amassed a lot of experience in the game at the highest level

Diego Lugano

The experienced Uruguay defender is without a club after leaving West Brom earlier this summer.

The 33-year-old joined the club from PSG last summer, but the Baggies triggered a break clause to let him go halfway through his two-year contract.

Lugano appeared for his country during the World Cup in Brazil so could prove to be a useful squad addition for a club battling against relegation. He has, however, been linked with a move to Serie A side Lazio.

Determined: Lugano is looking to get his career back on track after an indifferent spell at West Brom

Jonas

The Brazilian striker terminated his contract at Valencia on Monday after three years with the club and the 30-year-old should now have a number of interested suitors. 

Jonas scored 10 goals in all competitions last season, including an eight minute hat-trick against Osasuna in the league.

Capped 11 times by his country, Jonas still has plenty to offer at the highest level so it won't be to long before he gets a new club, with the Premier League potentially in sight for him.

Quality: Jonas would be a very shrewd acquisition for a number of Premier League sides

Nilmar

The Brazil forward has been in the Middle East playing for the last two years but is now available on a free transfer after his Al-Jaish contract was cancelled by mutual consent earlier this summer.

He was a star during his time at Villarreal alongside the likes of Santi Cazorla, proving he has what it takes to compete at the top.

Nilmar also has a decent track record on the international stage netting nine times in his 23 appearances for his country. Could be worth a go.

Reputable: Nilmar still has plenty to offer at the highest level

Anthony Reveillere

The experienced right back was with Napoli last season after joining on a free transfer in November.

The 34-year-old spent 10 years in the all-conquering Lyon side (domestically, at least), and had spells at Valencia and Rennes.

Despite his advancing years he could still do a job for a mid-table/lower Premier League side, with his five Ligue 1 title triumphs with Lyon proving he has the quality and mindset to succeed at the highest level. 

Top drawer: Anthony Reveillere has proved to be a very consistent player for club and country in his career

Florent Malouda

The experienced France winger knows the Premier League well following his time at Chelsea and was last with Trabzonspor.

The 34-year-old spent six years at Stamford Bridge making more than 150 appearances and he finished on a high in the dramatic 2012 Champions League win over Bayern Munich.

Leicester have reportedly been offered the wideman, who would bring versatility and experience to many a Premier League squad.

French fancy: Florent Malouda could still do a job for most Premier League sides

Joseph Yobo

Despite a disappointing spell on loan at Norwich last season as the Canaries were relegated, Yobo has plenty of Premier League nous.

The former Nigeria captain spent  nine years at Everton, featuring in over 200 Premier League matches, before moving to Turkish champions Fenerbahce in 2012.

The 33-year-old is now available on a free transfer after departing Turkey in the summer and newly-promoted sides could do a lot worse.

Rock at the back: Joseph Yobo was a fans' favourite during his time at Everton and still has plenty to offer

George McCartney 

At 33 McCartney is by no means a long-term option but will bring much-needed experience and leadership  to any of the struggling sides.

The left back spent five years at West Ham in two separate spells - he was released by the Hammers in the summer - and also captained Sunderland.

Any Premier League club would have to move quickly, however, as the former Northern Ireland defender is in talks with Australian side Sydney FC.

Experience: George McCartney has made around 200 Premier League appearances during his career

Matthew Etherington

Etherington is the kind of old-fashioned, chalk-on-his-boots winger who could provide attacking options for a few Premier League clubs, even at 33.

He left Stoke at the end of last season but as of yet has failed to find a new club.

After joining the Potters for £2million from West Ham in January 2009, Etherington became a firm fans favourite at the Britannia, making over 150 Premier League appearances during his five-year stint at the club, scoring in an FA Cup semi-final.

Old-fashioned winger: Matthew Etherington likes nothing more than to beat a full back and put in a cross

Jermaine Pennant

Another player who has left Stoke this year, Pennant has plenty of baggage but also lots of ability.

He has reportedly be seeing a sports psychologist in order to help get his attitude right and get his career back on track. 

Pennant was reportedly also set for a move to Italian outfit Napoli earlier this summer in a move which would have seen him link up with his former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, under whom he flourised and played in a Champions League final, but that failed to materialise.

Ability: Jermaine Pennant is still more than capable of playing in England's top flight

 Tomasz Kuszczak:

Kuszczak was an ever-present for Brighton before being released at the end of last season.

The former Manchester United stopper performed admirably down at the Amex as the Seagulls reached the Championship play-offs in successive years.

The 32-year-old would be a good No 2 for many clubs in the Premier League.

Highly rated: Tomasz Kuszczak is keen on a move to the Premier League after leaving Brighton

Park Chu-Young

Park never started a league game during his three years at Arsenal but, seeing as he is still only 29 the South Korea forward would be open to the idea of another chance to impress in the Premier League.

A newly-promoted side may take a punt on the former Celta Vigo and Watford loanee, who does have a decent goalscoring record at international level - with 24 goals in 65 appearances.

Talented: Park failed to impress at Arsenal but may want another opportunity to impress in the Premier League

 The following are also still available...

Abdoulaye Faye, Robert Earnshaw, Mikele Leigertwood, David Prutton, Anthony Gardner, Adam Drury, Sean St Ledger, Luke Young, Zat Knight, Peter Lovenkrands, Chris Eagles & Craig Fagan.
