The agent of Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes his client is capable of playing until he is 43 but does not believe he will end his career in the French capital.

Ibrahimovic, 33, has just over a year on his current contract at Parc des Princes and is said to be happy at the Ligue 1 outfit, however his representative Mino Raiola has questioned whether the Sweden international can play another eight to 10 years at PSG.

Raiola, speaking to RMC, said: 'Zlatan still has a year and a half on his contract.

'He is happy in Paris, he tries to do his best and is in good shape, though he had some problems this year. But for Zlatan the future is short.

'I don't know if he can finish his career at PSG. He worked for himself for 15 years, now he will work for me for the next eight years. I think he can play until he is 42 or 43 but I don't know if he will play another eight years at PSG.'

Ibrahimovic is eager to get his hands on the Champions League after failing to win the prestigious competition during his time at the likes of Juventus, Barcelona and AC Milan.

PSG face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday in the second leg of their last-16 clash which currently stands at 1-1, and Raiola is hopeful Ibrahimovic can lead his side to Champions League glory.

'I hope he wins the Champions League for his sake, for PSG and for French football,' added Raiola. 'It is a matter of luck too as it is not always the best team who wins.

'Zlatan told me the first-leg game against Chelsea was perfect. It was a perfectly prepared game. There is a lot of respect between Laurent Blanc and Ibra. I can tell he likes Blanc.' 

The Sweden ace has won trophies in Holland, Italy, Spain and France but is yet to win the Champions League
