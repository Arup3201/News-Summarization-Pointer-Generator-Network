A man who defied national outrage to fly an offensive Ku Klux Klan flag outside his Florida home has today relented and crumbled in the face of his livid wife.

The man, named only as Mr K. Hayes, removed the KKK and Confederate flags, a noose and 'Members Wanted' sign from his Boca Raton house this week.

His wife, Marla Curley, ordered Mr Hayes to take down the items after growing tired of the unwanted media attention.

Defiant: Mr Hayes erected the controversial display, featuring a Ku Klux Klan flag and noose, outside his Florida home several weeks ago

Refusal: But despite civil rights groups and neighbours complaining about the offensive flag, Mr Hayes refused to remove it. On Wednesday, he relented, after his angry wife stepped in, 'fed up' with all the negative media attention

She said the controversial paraphernalia will be replaced with an American flag.

While her husband refuses to say sorry for the offense he caused, Mrs Curley told WPTV News: 'I'll apologise, will that make you feel better?

'I apologise for my husband putting that up.'

Mr Hayes, who on his business card describes himself as a recruiter for the KKK, erected the display outside the couple's home several weeks ago.

Neighbours said they thought Mr Hayes was trying to recruit young people in the community to the racist group.

They raised their concerns and objected to the display, but Mr Hayes refused to budge, saying he did not care what others thought.

Apology: Marla Curley told reporters: 'I apologise for my husband putting that up.' She said the flag will be replaced with an American flag and added that the noose had been a 'bad joke'

He told Local 10 News: 'Everybody is entitled to do what they want to do. That's what this country is all about - freedom of speech. It's my patriotic duty.'

The Anti-Defamation League of south Florida has condemned Mr Hayes's actions after he claimed the flag represented his heritage.

Spokesman Yael Hershfield, said: 'What's he's displaying is hate and there's no comparison between the two.'

Mrs Curley said the couple cannot understand why the display has caused so much offense, adding that the noose had been a 'bad joke'.
