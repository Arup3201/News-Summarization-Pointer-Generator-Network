U.S. and Arab warplanes have killed 464 Islamic State militants in Syria since they began targeting the terror group with airstrikes last month.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a total of 553 people have been killed in bombing raids since September 23 - 32 of them civilians, including six children and five women.

The group said it has documented the deaths of 464 fighters with the Islamic State group, adding that the real number could be much higher. Another 57 fighters with the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front were killed in airstrikes on the northern province of Aleppo and Idlib, the Observatory said.

Blast: An American airstrike hits ISIS targets in Kobane this morning. A total of 553 people have been killed in the raids - 464 ISIS militants, 57 Al Qaeda militants and 32 civilians, including six children and five women

Many of the Islamic State fighters have been killed in or near the northern Syrian town of Kobane, the target of a massive jihadi offensive since mid-September.

ISIS fighters have captured dozens of Kurdish villages and forced more than 200,000 people to flee for safety in neighboring Turkey.

News of the deaths came as coalition warplanes targeted an ISIS-held oil field in the eastern Deir el-Zour province near Iraq this morning.

Earlier this week, The U.S. Central Command said its forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Kobane, killing hundreds of fighters.

'Combined with continued resistance to ISIL on the ground, indications are that these strikes have slowed ISIL advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions,' Central Command said in a statement.

 Journalist on the Turkish side of the border said heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the town this morning.  The Observatory meanwhile reported four coalition airstrikes on oil wells in the Jafra field in Deir el-Zour late last night.

The Local Coordination Committees, an activist group, also reported the airstrikes in areas held by the Islamic State group.

The U.S.-led coalition has aggressively targeted IS-held oil facilities in Syria, which provide a key source of income for the militants. But such strikes also endanger civilians, which could undermine long-term efforts to destroy the militant group.

The attacks on the oil industry, including refineries, have also led to a sharp rise in the price of oil products in rebel-held areas of Syria.

The chilling sight of the Islamic State's black jihadist flag is still visible in  Kobane - despite Kurdish territorial gains and  weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes.

The terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city after hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane.

But this morning the group's black jihadist flag could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) could be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex.

The image emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying ISIS-held buildings with a barrage of air-to-surface missiles.

This morning lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground.

The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.
