A man has died after plunging 656ft down a mountainside in the Lake District.

The 24-year-old was hiking with a companion on Helvellyn - the third highest peak in the country - when he lost his footing and fell to his death.

A Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter was dispatched as part of a rescue mission - but the man's body was later recovered from Nethermost Cove.

Location: Helvellyn, the scene of the death in the Lake District, is the third highest peak in the country

According to Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team, the hiker fell from Striding Edge between 3pm and 4pm yesterday.

His walking partner found him unconscious - but because there was no mobile phone signal, he could not raise the alarm.

He continued his descent into Grisedale where a local farmer gave him a lift to Patterdale so he could contact the emergency services.

Paramedics, mountain rescue teams and search and rescue dogs were dispatched to search for the man, who is yet to be named.

Scene: According to mountain rescuers, the hiker fell from Striding Edge (right) between 3pm and 4pm

However, more than four hours later, 
they discovered his body in the large cove.

Helvellyn, the third highest mountain peak in England, stands 3,117ft above sea level.

Striding Edge is one of the most popular areas of the mountain with walkers and climbers - but is a notorious accident spot on the mountain.

Mountain rescue teams say they are often called out to walkers in the area without basic equipment such as a compass or torch.

During severe conditions they recommend full winter gear, including ice axes and crampons.

A memorial is on the mountain to tourist Charles Gough, who died in 1805 while trying to cross Striding Edge to reach the summit.

The Romantic poet William Wordsworth is also strongly linked to Helvellyn, after often climbing the mountain and also writing about it.

Patterdale MRT leader Mike 
Blakey said: 'This is a tragic incident involving the loss of a young 
life.

'Our thoughts are with the young man's walking companion, friends and family at this difficult time.'

Last year, a 
63-year-old fell runner died of hypothermia after he plunged 1,000ft in 
the Lake District after race officials lost count of the entrants.

Brian Belfield disappeared while competing in the gruelling Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run on April 28, 2012.

In August, an inquest at Cockermouth Coroner's 
Court heard a total of 133 runners entered the 9.5-mile race but a 
mix-up meant organisers assumed only 132 runners had taken part.

By
the time rescue crews began searching the mountainside weather 
conditions were too bad and his body was found the next morning.

Despite
falling down the mountainside, Mr Belfield suffered no broken bones but
died from exposure after landing in a freezing puddle.

In trouble: The man's walking partner found him unconscious on Helvellyn - but because there was no mobile phone signal, he could not raise the alarm

A Patterdale MRT spokesman said: ‘In spite of low cloud the (Great North) Air Ambulance was able to drop its paramedic crew and shuttle eight team members up towards Striding Edge.

‘A search was commenced and Penrith Mountain Rescue Team and Search & Rescue Dogs were requested to mobilise and assist with locating the injured man.

‘By the time that the RAF Sea King arrived on scene, (the) cloud base had lifted sufficiently for them to assist and the helicopter crew located the casualty from the air.

‘Team members on foot made their way to his location over steep lose ground but sadly he had sustained fatal injuries. The team doctor diagnosed death and his body was lowered in a stretcher to the waiting aircraft.’
