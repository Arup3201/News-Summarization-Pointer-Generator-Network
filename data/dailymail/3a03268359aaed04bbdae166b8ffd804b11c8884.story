Five hundred British jobs are at risk after French authorities threatened to withdraw subsidies to a cross-Channel ferry route.

The Newhaven to Dieppe ferry has cost French taxpayers £190million over the past ten years. But a senior official in France has warned that the route cannot continue to depend on the massive public subsidy.

The Transmanche ferry route is currently run by DFDS Seaways but its contract expires next year.

It’s now unclear if a new operator can be found beyond 2015, which would mark the 50th anniversary of the route from Newhaven, East Sussex.

In the meantime, the General Council of Seine-Maritime (CGSM), which subsidises the link, is looking for new investors.

Nicolas Rouly, president of the CGSM, said: 'I wonder about the relevance of a link that depends solely on public funds.

'This is a potentially difficult decision to take to stop the line. But we have spent £190million pounds of public money in ten years.'

Users of the line have reacted with dismay at the threat, describing the threat of closure as a 'disaster'.

Roger Hudson, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'Our government is pouring billions into already saturated rail transport alongside private initiatives yet ignores routes like this that relieves the burden on rail and the inadequate road network.

'It would be a disaster for Sussex passengers and businesses if this line were to close.

'It is the most direct route from London and the South-East to Paris and western France for both commercial and domestic users.'
