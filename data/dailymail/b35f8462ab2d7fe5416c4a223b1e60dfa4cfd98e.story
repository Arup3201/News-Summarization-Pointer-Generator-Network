A grieving family were forced to pay nearly £1,000 for a great-grandmother to be buried next to her husband - because she moved less than a MILE down the road.

Janet Smith had bought the plot next to Terence - who was known as Terry - at Redhill Cemetery in Gedling, Nottingham, after he died from lung cancer in September 2001 aged 67. 

The mother-of-two's family were left stunned after she passed away, aged 72, and funeral directors told them it would cost £1,500 for her to be buried next to her husband as planned.

When Mr Smith died the couple - who had been married for 34 years - were living in Daybrook, which was within the Gedling Borough Council boundary.

However, Mrs Smith was unable to bear living in the house she had shared with her husband for eight years, so moved less than a mile away to Bestwood Park, Nottingham, in 2006.

Penpushers at Gedling Borough Council have said her burial fee would be £1,416 because the pensioner had become a Nottingham City Council resident.

The family  found out if she had stayed 0.9 miles away in the Gedling borough, the cost would have been just £520.

Mrs Smith's granddaughter Ammie Hemingway, 30, who lives in Arnold, Nottingham, accused the council of 'grave robbing'.

'The funeral directors told us the graveyard in Gedling Borough Council was nearly £1,500 because she didn't live there anymore.

'When she bought the grave she bought a triple plot so she could be buried next to her husband.

'We were absolutely gob-smacked when we found out. It feels like 21st-century grave robbing.

'My nan had lived in Gedling borough for eight years before she moved, but apparently that isn't long enough.

'The council are saying because she hasn't paid council taxes there for eight years we have to pay that much more.

'We just couldn't understand why a job that is being done by the same people and using the same equipment has an £896 price difference depending on where in Nottingham you live.

'My nan moved because she didn't want to live in that house on her own and she wanted a fresh start but she didn't want to move out of the area.

'She only moved just down the road and she walked to the cemetery every day to visit my grandad's grave and look after it.'

Mrs Smith passed away on December 12 after a short battle with secondary liver cancer.

Her daughter Karen McEvoy, 47, who lives in Bestwood Park, added: 'When they told us how much it was going to cost we just sat there dumb-founded.

'It was a hard enough time anyway, having just lost my mum, so to be told that we'd have to fork out all that money was a kick in the teeth.

The council said 'we 'We offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough's cemeteries'

'She moved less than a mile away, but the fact she'd moved to a different council area wasn't something she'd ever thought about.

'We've paid the extra money as that's where she wanted to be buried, but it felt like we had no choice.'

The grandmother-of-four, who also had seven great-grandchildren, had left some money to pay for her funeral but it wasn't enough to cover the extra cost of digging the grave.

The family have now had to cut back for the service, which is taking place on December 30, to ensure the widow can be buried next to her husband  who worked as a gas man. 

A spokesman for Gedling Borough Council said: 'We offer a discounted price for residents who wish to be buried in one of the borough's cemeteries.

'While we understand the family's frustration, the eight years when the person lived in the borough was not long enough to have a long-term connection to the area.'
