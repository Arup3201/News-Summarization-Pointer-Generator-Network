Stopped: Police found Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pictured here with wife Anne Sinclair, trying to 'clean-up' a Paris park notorious for transvestite prostitutes, France's Interior Minister said

Dominique Strauss-Kahn was stopped by police who were trying to 'clean up' a Paris park notorious for transvestite prostitutes, France's Interior Minister said yesterday.

Claude Gueant said the former International Monetary Fund chief was spoken to by officers patrolling the Bois du Boulogne.

The incident was recorded in a police log five years ago, before being publicly announced by Mr Gueant in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.

Asked about the matter, he said: 'Yes, I've heard of this story.

'But there was no action taken over this matter. He wasn't framed by the police.

'He was not being followed. After all, it's not the police's fault if he was there that night.'

Mr Strauss-Kahn, who claims there is a conspiracy aimed at stopping him becoming the next president of France, admitted that he had been stopped by police in the park, which is near his home.

But he said he was with his wife, the former TV presenter Anne Sinclair. His lawyer Richard Malka said: 'It was nothing more than a routine check', and added that during 15 years living near the park, the couple had been 'stopped several times'.

Last week, 62-year-old Mr Strauss-Kahn claimed that his 'uninhibited' sex life cost him his chance to become president. He denied paying prostitutes but admitted attending 'sex parties'.

He is at the centre of a judicial inquiry into a vice-girl ring operating out of a hotel in Lille, northern France.

But he said: 'I have a horror of prostitution and pimping. Can you imagine the damage caused to my wife, our children?'

Cleaning up? The Bois de Boulogne, in Paris, is one of the most infamous red light districts in the city and famous for its transvestite prostitutes

Close bond: French President Nicolas Sarkozy with multi-millionaire Sebastien Bazin

He was also investigated over the alleged attempted rape of writer Tristane Banon, now 32, in 2001.

It has been claimed that government 
agents were behind a 'plot' which saw Mr Strauss-Kahn accused of trying 
to rape a chambermaid in a New York hotel this year.

Although he was eventually cleared, 
his campaign to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy as Socialist candidate for 
president is in tatters.

And yesterday new links emerged 
between President Sarkozy and the Accor Group, which owns the Sofitel 
hotel where Mr Strauss-Kahn was accused of the attack on the 
chambermaid.

One of Accor's senior directors has 
been close to the president since Mr Sarkozy – then mayor of a Paris 
suburb – helped rescue his three-year-old daughter from a school siege.

Sebastien Bazin's daughter, Fleur, 
was one of 21 children taken hostage at their nursery in the Paris 
suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1993.

Mr Sarkozy was part of a negotiating team who helped free the girl.
