A 'beautiful shed' with an aviary-style enclosure has been voted the best home by the public at the national architecture awards.

The Oxlade Drive House at New Farm in Brisbane's inner city was designed by James Russell from James Russell Architect.

The property was shortlisted as one of 13 houses in the Australian Institute of Architects' 2014 National Architecture Awards before taking out the first People's Choice Award.

The practical design of the elevated home appealed to voters for its indoor/outdoor layout and its clever response to local inset life - a full shade cloth screen encasing the courtyard spaces.

Mr Russell said the property was a 'beautiful shed' with the courtyard being its main feature.

'We are happy for people to think of it as an aviary or a butterfly enclosure,' he told the Courier Mail.

'In Brissie we do get mozzies and flies. It becomes a very soft layer of privacy as well and moderates the heat.'

The home was designed as a series of two-storey Ironbark-clad pavilions that run the length of the block  - each pavilion is separated by a courtyard.

Mr Russell said the building's layout allowed for plenty of summer breeze or winter sun and doesn't require an air-conditioner, Architect and Design reports.

In awarding Oxlade Drive House at the Queensland Architecture Awards, the jury noted it was 'an intelligent, appropriate reinterpretation of the possibilities of inner city living'

In awarding Oxlade Drive House at the Queensland Architecture Awards, the jury noted it was 'an intelligent, appropriate reinterpretation of the possibilities of inner city living'.  

'(It is) a robust and unexpected series of devices and palette of materials engage the senses and heighten the connection between the inside and out. 

'A provocative, poetic but practical outcome, testament to James's discourse of living in the sub-tropics.'

The winners of the National Awards will be announced at a ceremony in Darwin on Thursday, November 6.
