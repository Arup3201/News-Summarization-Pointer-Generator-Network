A co-founder of Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron because he disliked his sexually-explicit tattoo also owns illegal guns, according to police.

Young Lee, 47, was arrested at Los Angeles airport last month and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. The alleged incident last June left the victim with a broken arm and cuts to the head.

Police then searched his Los Angeles home and fleet of luxury cars and found two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Para Ordnance Brand .45.

Legal problems: Pinkberry co-founder Young Lee, pictured with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen at a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, had illegal guns in his home, police claim. He is accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron

It is unclear whether the firearms were found in Lee's house or high-end vehicles including a 2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom, 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB and a 2010 Mercedes G Wagon.

A police search warrant affidavit obtained by TMZ.com states that, due to a 2001 conviction for drugs possession, Lee is not allowed to 'own, buy, receive, possess, or have custody or control of any firearms'.

He also has a conviction for possession of a firearm and could now face this same charge again.

Lee is accused of assaulting the unnamed homeless man on the off-ramp of a motorway last June.

He saw a tattoo - of a man and woman having sex - when the transient was changing his sweater and became so angry, he got out of his car and approached him, it is claimed.

Lee's attorney claims his client was threatened by the man and thought he had a weapon.

Craze: Lee co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first shop in Hollywood in 2005, immediately gaining a celebrity following

But
police believe it was the Korean-born entrepreneur who first approached
him after seeing what he deemed a disrespectful tattoo.

They
believe that Lee drove over to the man, rolled down his window and 
started arguing with him, before getting out to confront him.

Officials
say Lee demanded that the man kneel on the ground and apologise and 
even though he consented, he still attacked him with the tyre iron.

The homeless man was beaten so brutally he had to be hospitalised.

Former kickboxer Lee paints a very different picture, however.

His
attorney Philip Kent Cohen last month told the Los Angeles Times that 
'the transient made explicit threats as if he had a weapon, which he may
have had.

'As the evidence comes out, the reality will be much different than has been presented.

'All of the people in the car felt at risk and felt threatened.'

Hugely successful: The Korean-born entrepreneur already has a conviction for possession of a firearm

Lee
- who co-founded the healthy, low-calorie dessert chain - was arrested 
after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the 
Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name.

Investigators later recovered the tyre iron through the rental car agency.

Witnesses picked Lee from police photos and authorities obtained the warrant while the 47-year-old was traveling overseas.

According
to police, a federal database alerted Los Angeles detectives that Lee 
was aboard an inbound flight from Korea to Los Angeles Airport last 
month, when he was arrested.

Lee is currently free on $60,000 bail.

Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang, CBS Los Angeles reports.

They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze.
