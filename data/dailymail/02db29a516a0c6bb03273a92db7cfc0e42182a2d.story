A classic Ferrari once involved in a fatal accident has become the most expensive car ever sold publicly after being snapped up for an incredible $38.1million (£22.85million).

The 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO was the first model of its type to be sold at an auction in almost 25 years.

Bonhams' auction house in Monterey, California, was packed for the sale while interested parties from around the world watched the most hotly anticipated car event in years online.

Hot wheels: This classic Ferrari 250GTO has become the most expensive car ever sold after fetching a staggering $38.1 million at auction

The car in question, known as 3851 GT, is the only 250 GTO to be involved in a fatal car accident.

Olympic skiing champion Henri Oreiller was killed in 1962 when he crashed the car while doing 100mph at Montlhery Autodrome, just south of Paris, France.

But despite his death, there was no shortage of interest when the car with bidding starting at $10 million.

Around 15 minutes later, the hammer eventually went down at $34.65 million with the final bill, including premiums, standing at $38.1 million (£22.85 million).

The
 winner of the auction was an unnamed man bidding over the phone. He 
outbid Bill Heinecke, an American businessman based in Thailand.Robert
 Brooks, chairman of London-based Bonhams, said: 'It's been a genuine 
privilege to represent this outstanding car and we are absolutely 
delighted with today's results.

Mystery buyer: The classic 1962 red Ferrari, the first model of its type to be sold at an auction in almost 25 years, was bought by an unnamed phone bidder over the phone

Sleek: The Ferrari 250 GTO is regarded by enthusiasts as the Holy Grail of motoring due to its rarity, history, stunning  looks and performance on the track and the road

Rarity: Just 36 250GTOs were built between 1962 and 1964 with the seriously sought-after motors normally changing hands behind closed doors

'We've always maintained that we would exceed the current world record and that the car would bring between $30-$40-million and today the GTO did just that.'

It is the first time in almost 25 years that a Ferrari 250 GTO has been sold publicly with most cars changing hands secretly behind closed doors. There was a lot of hype around the sale with many thinking it would sell for in excess of £35 million.

Ferrari historian Marcel Massini described the final price paid as the 'steal of the week'.

However,
 John Collins, boss of Ascot-based Ferrari dealer Talacrest, said he 
would probably have paid around $35million (£21 million) for the car.

Mr
 Collins has sold eight Ferrari 250 GTOs over the years - selling one in
 1994 for $4.2million (£2.5 million), a TENTH of the price of the car sold on Thursday
 night.

The
 price paid in Monterey is $5million more than the $38 million paid 
for Juan Fangio's Mercedes W196 racer at Bonhams' Goodwood Festival of 
Speed sale in 2013.

Bargain? Some had expected the rare motor to sell for in excess of $58million with Ferrari historian Marcel Massini describing the final price paid as the 'steal of the week'

Performance: The GTO boasts a 3-litre V12 engine developing around 300bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of 6.1 seconds and a blistering top speed of 174mph

The Ferrari 250 GTO is regarded as the Holy Grail of motoring due to its rarity, history, looks and performance on the track and the road.

Just 36 were built between 1962 and 1964 with the seriously sought-after motors normally changing hands behind closed doors.

Under the 
bonnet of the GTO is a 3-litre V12 engine developing 300bhp - meaning a 
0-60mph time of 6.1 seconds and a top speed of 174mph.

The
 buyer will join the likes of Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, fashion 
designer Ralph Lauren and JCB boss Anthony Bamford as an exclusive 
number who own a GTO.

Jeff
 Fosker, from UK Ferrari specialist Foskers, added: 'The hammer price 
for the 250 GTO in Monterey didn't live up to the pre-sale mania, but 
the final result is still impressive.

History: The car, known as 3851 GT, is the only 250 GTO to be involved in a fatal car accident. Olympic skiing champion Henri Oreiller was killed in 1962 when he crashed the car while doing 100mph at Montlhery Autodrome, just south of Paris, France

'It sets a new world record for a car sold at auction at nearly £23 million - despite the fact that Henri Oreiller died after crashing it.

'Of course, a car with a less tragic history would certainly have fetched even more.'

Bonhams ended up selling ten cars at the sale at Quail Lodge, California, with a total of $66million (£39.5million) paid.

Bill Heinecke, the Thai-based businessman who was outbid on the GTO, consoled himself by spending almost $7million on a 1962 Ferrari 250 GT Speciale.
