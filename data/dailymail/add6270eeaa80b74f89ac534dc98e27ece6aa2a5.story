Fame can bring a lot of things - money, fast cars and mansions. 

But you know you've hit the big time when you have been transformed into a doll. 

The One Direction boys were in Los Angeles this week to launch their new and updated figurines.

And the dolls have proved to be a huge success in America selling out as soon as they hit the shelves. However, they are only available in U.S. 

Meanwhile, Louis Tomlinson, 21, Zayn Malik, 20, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Niall Horan, all 19, have been splashing the cash during their time in Los Angeles forking out £17,500 to stay in a Hollywood Hills mansion to celebrate the end of the U.S. part of their world tour which was a sell-out.

The six bedroom house looks like a cruise ship from the front and has a 46ft swimming pool, two hot tubs, eight bathrooms, panoramic views, a bar, disco, sauna and two kitchens.

So while they're not on stage at the Staples Center for their last few concerts before heading to Australia, the British boys will be living it up in the exclusive pad which boasts breathtaking views across the city.

Proving just how much money they are now raking in, just three years after being on the ITV singing contest, the youngsters are hardly being frugal, preferring to live it up in unrivalled opulence.

The decision to rent the lavish home, which is nestled far away from the city, may have something to do with the fact that the boys have been causing quite a stir while in the US.

Cinemas showing the documentary 1D: This Is Us, have reportedly been asked to step up their security after having to deal with stampedes of fans, even though the boys aren't there in person.

The band have been looking far from exhausted despite the fact that they've been spending almost all of their time on the road recently, giving their usual high-energy performances at their gigs.

And they haven't got long left to go as after six weeks off, they will flying to Australia for the last leg of the world tour, finishing off in Melbourne on October 30.

Other bands which have been transformed into their own dolls include Little Mix.
