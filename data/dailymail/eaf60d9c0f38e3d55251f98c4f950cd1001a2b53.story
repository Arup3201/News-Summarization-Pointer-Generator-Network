Nearly 200 motorists are still free to drive on Britain’s roads despite being 100 years old or more.

The number of people aged over 70 who hold driving licences has exceeded four million for the first time, according to the RAC Foundation.

The oldest licence holder is a 107-year-old woman, while there are 191 people aged over 100 who have licences.

Nearly 200 motorists are still free to drive on Britain's roads despite being 100 years old or more

Once motorists reach 70 they must declare every three years whether or not they are fit to drive – without having to take a driving or medical examination. 

Concerns have been raised that some elderly people could be continuing to drive when they are not fit to do so, while others give up their cars too early and risk exclusion from services and activities.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘All drivers should regularly consider their fitness to drive, but matters come to a head when we reach 70 and have to declare that we should be on the roads. 

‘In general, older drivers have an enviable safety record, but it is clear that faced with this critical yes-or-no decision, many motorists simply do not have a realistic view of their capabilities.

‘For those reliant on a car, giving up driving will have a huge impact on their ability to live an active life, so it is important that they get all the help and support to make the right decision at the right time.’

The RAC Foundation found that there are 4,018,900 people aged over 70 with full British driving licences.

As the post-war generation of ‘baby boomers’ reaches retirement, that four million figure is on course to exceed ten million, its figures reveal today.

It is at age 70 - and every three years thereafter - that drivers must declare whether or not they are fit to drive

The foundation rejects calls for compulsory re-testing of drivers at a certain age because ‘it presumes that on reaching a particular birthday people’s physical and mental capacities change radically’.

But coming to terms with a ‘growing bulge’ of older drivers will require changes in attitudes by younger drivers, who will be urged not to write off older drivers as being too old to be behind the wheel. 

It also puts responsibility on the older drivers to be honest with themselves if they find that growing incapacity means they are posing a potential risk to themselves and others.

The RAC Foundation report notes: ‘The number of older people with driving licences has exceeded the four million mark. While not all of these licence holders will be active drivers the statistics illustrate the growing number of older people who still use a car. 

‘And the total is set to increase dramatically.’

The Government has predicted that of the UK citizens alive today, around ten million will reach their 100th birthday.

It is at age 70 – and every three years thereafter – that drivers must declare whether or not they are fit to drive. 

But the report notes: ‘This self-declaration is not made on the basis of any formal medical or driving test, but relies on the judgment of the individual.’

To help people make ‘the right decision’ the RAC Foundation is supporting the publication of a new guide called ‘Driving Safely for Life’, which aims to keep older people mobile and safe for longer.

Drivers aged 75 and over make up 6 per cent of all licence holders but account for just 4.3 per cent of accidents involving death or serious injury.

By contrast, drivers aged 16-20 make up just 2.5 per cent of all drivers but are involved in 13 per cent of accidents in which people are killed or seriously injured.
