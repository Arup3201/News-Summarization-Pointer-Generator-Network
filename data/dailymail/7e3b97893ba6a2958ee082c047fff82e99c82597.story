Eddie Redmayne has been widely praised for his portrayal of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, a film that portrays the first steps in his career and his diagnosis with motor neurone disease.

The new movie, which has already been tipped for awards season success, is based on Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, and Eddie has even been tipped for an Oscar.

So who is Eddie Redmayne and how did he make the leap from gawky Eton schoolboy to esteemed actor and model?

Big star: Eddie Redmayne last night attended the UK Premiere of The Theory Of Everything, within which he plays renowned physicist Stephen Hawking. He's been tipped for an Oscar, so who exactly is Eddie and how did he make it?

It seems that 32-year-old Eddie, who was born in London in 1982, was always set for success.

He attended Eton College, where Prince Harry and William and David Cameron were educated, and was house captain.

He went on to study History of Art at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated in 2003 with a 2:1. 

Clearly keen to pursue a career in musical theatre, he joined the National Youth Music Theatre, and his first appearance was at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre  in 2002.

Critics were quick to notice his talents. He was awarded with Outstanding Newcomer at the 50th Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2004 and Best Newcomer at the Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards in 2005.

After making his mark on the stage, he moved into TV with a role in BBC's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, The Pillars of the Earth, and  Birdsong.

His acting abilities landed him huge film roles in The Good Shepherd, Savage Grace, The Other Boleyn Girl and Black Death. 

Two of his major roles were playing Colin Clark in the drama film My Week with Marilyn and Marius in Les Misérables. 

Despite his stellar acting career, in an interview with Elle Magazine, Eddie Redmayne said he has struggled to be recognised as a serious actor after his initial modelling success.

'I read a review recently that said, "Who knew Eddie Redmayne was more than just a pout?"' he told the publication. 

'You think, "Nice, you’ve recognised that, but at the same time that’s 10 years of work you’ve just dismissed as pouting."'

Luckily for Eddie, Hawking is his biggest fan and said he was so taken by the actor's performance that at times he mistook Eddie for himself.

'I thought [he] portrayed me very well. At times I thought he was me,' he told The Independent.

'I think Eddie’s commitment will have a big emotional impact.'

Sorry, ladies! Eddie is engaged to publicist Hannah Bagshawe and the pair are currently planning their wedding

Meanwhile, Eddie's personal life is proving just as noteworthy as his acting work - he's busy planning his wedding.

Following his June engagement, the actor has been working with Hannah on their perfect day.

He recently told E! News:

'The plan is a winter wedding. We're in the thick of that at the moment... We're doing our best.' 

In June, a representative for the British star confirmed the news of his engagement to the financial publicist.

The Les Misérables star reportedly proposed to his long-term love while on a romantic holiday, US Weekly revealed.

'He had been planning on it for a while,' a source told the magazine.

'They have a very relaxed and supportive relationship. They seemed to have always known they were going to spend the rest of their lives together.'

Where it all began: Eddie seen modelling for Rowan Yarns in 2004 when he was 22, left, and winning the Milton Shulman Award for Outstanding Newcomer at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2004

Hannah attended the University of Edinburgh where she obtained an MA in English Literature and French.

An engagement announcement was posted in The Times, which read:

'Mr E.J.D. Redmayne and Miss H.J. Bagshawe. The engagement is announced between Edward, son of Mr and Mrs Richard Redmayne of London, and Hannah, daughter of Mr Nicholas Bagshawe and Mrs Caryl Bagshawe, both of London.' 

While he is preparing to walk down the aisle now, Eddie's love life has been colourful and he's been linked to some of tinsel town's most beautiful and talented women.

He was linked to actress Carey Mulligan in 2011 but neither commented on the romance.

A year later it was rumoured that he was seeing Taylor Swift after they met when Taylor auditioned for Les Miserables. He later denied the rumours saying: 'We had a chat behind the stage for seven minutes. Even by my standards, that’s a pretty brief relationship!'.

He starred in a Burberry campaign with Cara Delevingne in 2012 and people were quick to comment but neither ever commented on the supposed chemistry. 

In 2013, he was linked to Amanda Seyfried after the pair seemed close at a Les Mis photocall and at an awards shows.

Eddie is extremely well connected and is often seen hanging around in London with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Douglas Booth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sam Claflin, Daisy Lowe and Jamie Dornan.

Last night, in an especially poignant moment for Redmayne, he was joined by Hawking in front of photographers as the pair prepared to watch the early years of his life played out on film.

Largely centred on the former couple's relationship, it covers the period from Hawking's days as a PhD student at Cambridge until 1989 when he was named a Companion of Honour by the Queen.

Speaking on the blue carpet, the 32-year-old actor admitted that despite having crossed paths with the professor during his own student days at Cambridge, he still felt starstruck at the prospect of playing him.

He said: 'I'd been a student at Cambridge and seen Stephen across campus, heard his voice, but I was pretty ignorant so when I read the script, everything was a revelation.

'Stephen and Jane let Felicity and I into their lives, so we felt an enormous amount of responsibility to get it right.'
