A law to allow assisted suicide for the terminally ill could become ‘state-approved self-extinction’, Boris Johnson has warned.

The London Mayor said plans to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to anyone who could 'reasonably be expected to die within six months' could mean some people come under pressure to end their lives too soon.

Mr Johnson warned ‘life is precious and our psychology fragile’ and any change to the law must be made with caution.

On Friday peers will debate a law allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live.

The legislation has been drawn up by Lord Falconer, a former Labour Lord Chancellor who served in Tony Blair’s Cabinet.

The Church of England has urged Lord Falconer to drop his Bill in favour of a Royal Commission into the issue.

Mr Johnson revealed he has met the campaign Dignity in Dying to discuss the issue ahead of this week’s debate.

He said he found the young woman he met ‘charming and persuasive’, he became concerned about the wording of the Bill.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said: ‘I started to worry that it might indeed pave the way for something unintended – something ugly and distressing: not exactly a culture of death, but a world in which it was simply too easy to opt for this state-approved self-extinction.’

The Bill, to be debated on Friday states that doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of medicine to people who could ‘reasonably be expected to die within six months’.

Mr Johnson suggested that the wording be ‘tighetned up’ to cover only those people who ‘could not reasonably be expected to survive more than six months’.

He added: I think it right to be cautious, because we are proposing to make a very big change in our approach to death and dying: giving people much more of a right to choose when to die, and above all giving the state an obligation to help us consciously to do away with ourselves, if certain conditions are satisfied.

‘I am sure it is a change the public broadly supports, and one whose time has come. But life is precious and our psychology fragile.

‘Those suffering terminal illnesses can easily find themselves under pressure – external or internal – to make decisions from which, obviously, there is no going back.’

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned a proposed new law on assisted dying is ‘mistaken and dangerous’, but his predecessor Lord Carey insists it would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law

Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu says he would not like his life to be 'prolonged artificially' 

Lord
 Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would require patients to administer the
 poison themselves. It  would not help those who are paralysed or lack 
the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs. 

Existing
 rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for 
aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain. But 
they ban British doctors taking any role in a death.

Falconer’s
 Bill would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly 
drugs if they are  terminally ill and expected to die within six months.

The patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in England or Wales for at least a year. 

Two
 doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was
 their informed wish to die. The patient would also have to signify 
their consent. There would be 14 days before drugs were provided, or six
 days if death was expected within a month.

Last week former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey revealed that he had dropped his long-standing opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying – and declared that it would not be ‘anti-Christian’ to change the law.

He warned that by opposing reform, the Church he led risks 'promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.’

However, current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said warned the Bill would leave a ‘sword of Damocles’ hanging over the elderly, putting them under pressure to end their lives.

Yesterday former Archbishop Desmond Tutu came out in favour of a change in the law on the right to die.

Writing in The Observer, he said: ‘Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually.

‘I have come to realise that I do not want my life to be prolonged artificially.

‘I think when you need machines to help you breathe then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent. This may be hard for some people to consider.’

He argued that money should be focussed ‘a mother giving birth to a baby, or an organ transplant needed by a young person’.

The Bishop of Buckingham, the Right Reverend Alan Wilson, yesterday became the first serving bishop to back the right to die.

He said: ‘I have come to support assisted dying precisely because I do believe strongly in the sanctity of life.

'Part of honouring this is respecting people’s integrity to make decisions about themselves.’ 

About right: Sir Chris Woodhead is backing the bill

Sir Chris Woodhead, the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic, yesterday gave his backing to Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill.

He believes the proposals are ‘about right’ and in tune with public opinion.

And he said the Falconer law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster.

‘They would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance.’ 

Sir Chris made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications.

He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that the decision to end one’s life ‘must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well’. 

‘I wouldn’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me,’ he said.

The Falconer proposals were ‘about right, given the range of public opinion on this issue’. Alternatives were ‘bleak’.

‘I would be far better if I could have my death assisted in a peaceful, dignified way so that my suffering wasn’t prolonged.’
