Britain's youngest break-dancing champion who became a worldwide internet sensation after a Youtube video went viral was today revealed to be a six-year-old schoolgirl from Wolverhampton.

Dachiya Atkinson wowed the judges at the Pro Chelles international dancing competition in Paris with a breathtaking routine which had the crowd on their feet.

Views of her break-dancing skills rocketed to a staggering 2.8 million within five days of being uploaded of the internet.

Six-year-old Dachiya Atkinson was named Britain's youngest breakdancing champion after competing at a competition in Paris

At the age of 18 months Dachiya Atkinson went to her first dance class and she could do head stands aged two

In the short video she stuns the crowd
with her moves by spinning on her head, performing windmills and 
forward flips like a trained professional.

Her parents revealed how the 
youngster had not only learned to walk by the age of nine months - but 
was doing handstands at just two years old.

And by the time Dachiya - whose performing name is B-Girl Terra - was three she was spinning on her head like a pro.

She won her first competition in 
Bath, Somerset, in 2012 and went to be crowned ‘Baby Battle Champion’ in
St Brieuc, France, later that year where she beat off competitors twice
her age.

Her mother Jennifer Hollyoak, 27, 
said: ‘She's always been quite confident and bouncy - she has loved 
dancing from a very young age.

‘Apart from this insane natural 
talent for break-dancing she is just a normal little girl - she likes 
dolls and playing with her toys.

Dachiya Atkinson, known by her stage name Terra, said her favourite dance move is the challenging headspin

‘I was worried she was going to get 
scared as she is only six, but she is still really happy when she comes 
off stage, even if she loses.

‘That is the important thing. She is 
very confident, and we are so proud. We can't quite believe how the 
video of her has taken off.

‘We were clicking on the clip and we 
were quite surprised when it got to 500,000 views, it was such a shock. 
Now three million people have seen it - it's unreal.

‘But she's just bothered about her 
friends and teachers at school seeing it. She loves the normal things 
like going to the cinema and playing with her friends.

‘I think because of her age the publicity hasn't hit her and she isn't aware of the buzz.’

Dachiya's father Dean took her to 
dance classes when she was 18 months old. She soon mastered the art and 
is now part of London-based dance troupe Soul Mavericks - the biggest in
the UK.

Dachiya said yesterday that her favourite dance move is the challenging headspin.

She said: ‘It feels really good when 
I'm dancing, I just love to be on the stage. My favourite move is the 
headspin, I find them easy to do now but it took a lot of practice.

‘I love dancing with my sister and 
all my friends think it's really good. In the future I'd like to be a 
world champion or be famous for dancing.’

Dachiya and her sister Damita currently train three times a week for a couple of hours each session and also do gymnastics.

The pair have more competitions lined up including an appearance at an event in Holland at the end of the year.
