When 50-year-old Consuela Ross went for a walk on the banks of Loch Ness with her daughter and granddaughter, she was simply hoping to photograph some of the stunning scenery.

But now she is claiming to have witnessed the latest glimpse of the fabled monster that dwells in its depths as it came to the surface for air.

However, despite having her camera in her hand she says she was too captivated to take a picture, and instead only managed to record the moment after the beast dived under the surface.  

Tourists taking pictures of Loch Ness swear they spotted the elusive monster that lurks in its depths, but were too mesmerised to photograph it, instead capturing the moment after it dived under (pictured)

Consuela Ross, 50 (left), was visiting the Loch with daughter Reyshell Avellanoza, 29 (centre), and granddaughter Heather Elizabeth, five (right), when they made the sighting. Husband Campbell Ross, 74 (centre), was waiting in the car park at the time

A video taken at the time shows a mysterious circle of disturbed water spreading outwards from the centre of the lake, which Mrs Ross swears was occupied by the beast moments earlier. 

Miss Ross was walking beside the lake with daughter Reyshell Avellanoza, 29, and granddaughter Heather Elizabeth, both from the Philippines, when the incident happened. 

The family had spent the day visiting nearby Urquhart Castle with Mrs Ross's husband, Campbell Ross, 73, when they decided to drive to the lake.

Mr Ross stayed in the car while the others went to the water's edge, when Heather, who was seeing the Loch for the first time, pointed out a strange shape.

Earlier this year Swedish monster-hunter Bjarne Sjöstrand, 52, won a £2,000 prize in a Nessie spotting competition after picking out a strange object on satellite images

Another sighting: International paranormal investigator, Jonathan Bright, took this photo three years ago, which he claims shows Nessie's head emerging from the Loch

Consuela told the Daily Record: 'She said it looked like a big black belly. We looked and could see this big disturbance quite a way out and this big black object in the middle of it.

'We were so mesmerised, we didn't immediately think of taking pictures although we had the cameras in our hands.

'By the time we realised what we were seeing and began filming and snapping away, the object had sank virtually out of sight and moved away further into the loch, leaving behind a perfect circle of water - like a whirlpool.'

Earlier this year Swedish monster-hunter Bjarne Sjöstrand, 52, won a £2,000 prize in a Nessie spotting competition after picking out a strange object on satellite images.

Mr Sjöstrand, who has never visited Scotland, won the best Loch Ness Monster sighting of 2014, in an annual competition run by bookmaker William Hill.

In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app.

The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast.

A satellite high in the atmosphere, accessed using Apple's satellite map app, took this amazing image of a creature swimming below the surface of the world famous loch

The systems administrator was at home in Stockholm when he spotted a long thin object in the water on a Google Earth image taken above Horse Shoe Scree on the loch's southern side. 

Mr Sjöstrand said: 'I am very interested in anything regarding Nessie and the history of Loch Ness. 

'The reason I found this image on Google Earth was that I was sitting one night at home reading about Nessie and Loch Ness on the internet and thought I would check to see if I could see something from above - and that proved to turn out well.

'I have never been to Scotland but my hopes are that one day I will visit Loch Ness.'

The picture is the latest in a series of possible Loch Ness Monster pictures. 

In November MailOnline reported that grainy footage had emerged showing a long and thin shape swaying in the water - one that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck.

The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft from the loch’s shore.

It was captured by Richard Collis – who counts himself amongst the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting.

But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal.

'As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness.

He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it.'

An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com

Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathon's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.'

Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged.

In 2001 semi-retired photographer James Gray and friend Peter Levings took this while they were out fishing

This picture, said to show the monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express
