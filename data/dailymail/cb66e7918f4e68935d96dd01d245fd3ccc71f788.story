When her weight began creeping up, and her trim size 10 frame ballooned to a fuller size 16, Kate Archibald was left confused.

The university student began to pile on the pounds in her first year.

While enjoying the student life, Miss Archibald said she couldn't account for her drastic weight gain.

But after waking one morning to find her bed covered in dozens of food wrappers, it dawned on the 20-year-old - she had been gorging in her sleep.

She has since been diagnosed with a medical condition called nocturnal sleep eating disorder - sleep walking while also carrying out a sufferer's conscious desires.

Kate Archibald, 20, couldn't understand why she was putting on weight in her first year at the University of Aberdeen. After waking up one morning surrounded by food wrappers she realised she was sleep eating

The now third-year student had noticed her weight increasing as she went from a svelte size 10 to a fuller size 16 by the end of her first year

Now in her third year at the University of Aberdeen, Miss Archibald said: 'I had absolutely no idea why I was putting on weight.

'And I used to get in massive rows with my flatmates about all this food that was going missing - I was adamant I hadn't eaten anything.

'It was only when I woke up one morning surrounded by chocolate bar wrappers that I realised I must have been sleep-eating.'

She said her local GP diagnosed the problem, which is listed on her ADHD medication as a potential side effect.

Miss Archibald has since stopped taking the drugs as often in a bid to reduce the effect. 

The philosophy and world religion student told her student newspaper The Tab: 'I used to have to take Adderall for ADHD - one of the side effects is that it completely suppresses your appetite. 

'When I was at boarding school, we had our tuck box at the bottom of our beds, and I would wake up when the medication wore off and feel ravenous, so I'd eat as much as I could.

'But when I got older, I stopped needing the medication as often, and because I didn't have any food in my uni room, I didn't think that I was waking up hungry any more.

'When the penny finally dropped that I was a sleep eater, I had stayed round a friend's house and in the morning there was a completely empty selection box - and the bed was filled with wrappers.'

During her midnight feasts, Miss Archibald gorges on thousands of calories, eating fatty snacks, including crisps, chocolate bars and nuts - despite hating the taste of them.  

She said: 'I'm a bit allergic to peanuts - they make my face swell a bit - so I always avoid them.

'But there have been some mornings where I've woken up and my whole face had ballooned, so I must have eaten them in the night.

'One of my housemates had been given a big bar of Galaxy by her boyfriend as a treat - but I managed to eat it and wake up the next morning with my face covered in chocolate.

The condition is a form of sleep walking, where sufferers act out their conscious desires while they are asleep. Miss Archibald said as well as crisps, chocolate and nuts, she has also been known to eat half a wheel of cheddar cheese and four helpings of spaghetti bolognaise

'We laugh about it now, but I still have to regularly go to the shop to replace my flatmates' food.

'The weirdest thing I've ever eaten in a night is a wheel of cheddar cheese.'

As well as making her way through the snack cupboard, Miss Archibald has devoured four portions of spaghetti bolognaise and even makes toast.  

Also known as sleep-related eating disorder, sleep eating is a combination of parasomnia and an eating disorder.

It has been described as a state of sleepwalking that includes behaviours connected to a person's conscious wishes or wants.

This is according to Dr John Winkleman, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

The condition is thought to be closely related to night eating syndrome (NES). Where it differs is in the fact those suffering NES are completely awake and aware of their binge-eating habits.

Those suffering nocturnal sleep eating disorder are unaware of their actions.

Dr Winkleman noted both disorders are fairly common, in around one to five per cent of adults, and are predominantly found in young adult women.

They are chronic illnesses and cause weight gain, sleep disruption and shame over loss of control over food intake.

She said: 'It isn't really seen as an eating disorder, apparently it's more of a parasomnia.

'Basically, my body is conditioned to be hungry in the night and want food - even if I don't.

'It's sleep-walking, rather than an actual eating disorder.

'I've started locking myself in my room now, with lots of healthy snacks - but I still manage to get out and raid the fridge.

'My flatmates think I'm mad, but I'm always apologetic so they don't mind too much. 

'I try and combat all the food I eat by going to the gym as much as possible.'

Her flatmates, Ellie Harding and Ashleigh Black, have to try and convince Miss Archibald to not eat their food, but feel they are fighting a losing battle.

Miss Harding said: 'If there's anything that we don't want her to eat we have to tell her.

'We just have to hope that her subconscious is listening and that she doesn't eat our good food.

'The funny thing is that she's forever going to Tesco in the morning to replace what she's eaten of ours.

'The ultimate fear is that she'll cook something during one of her episodes. 

'We don't want her burning the flat down.'

Miss Archibald, who said she thinks she sleep eats about three nights a week, added: 'I've never actually been caught in the act, but most nights I sleep naked, so that's probably a blessing.'
