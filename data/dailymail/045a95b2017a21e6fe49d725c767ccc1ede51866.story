Improvement: Christina Sadler, 45, said her son Tom Roberts, 12, has turned his life around

A mother who dubbed her 12-year-old son ‘Britain’s naughtiest schoolboy’ said today he had turned his life around after appearing on Channel 4 show Mr Drew’s School For Boys.

Tom Roberts, of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, has suffered with behavioural problems since he was 16 months old - and would even try to climb out of his cot and out of windows.

His mother Christina Sadler, 45, said she tried everything to discipline her child before he was permanently expelled from school.

She then signed Tom up to Educating Essex star Mr Drew’s residential summer school, which aims to improve the lives of troubled boys.

Tom has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with symptoms including short attention spans, restlessness and being easily distracted.

Tom’s bad behaviour started from an early age and in Year Two he was often in trouble for fighting and hitting other children at break times.

Mrs Sadler said: ‘There were times when I thought I’d got Britain’s naughtiest boy on my hands. I just didn’t know what to do any more. I saw an advert in one of the magazines for Mr Drew and I was desperate so I signed us up.’

A turning point in Tom’s life was when his father died in 2009 - and Mrs Sadler, who has two daughters she describes as ‘angels’, was regularly asked to come into his former school.

She said: ‘I was called into school every day to help monitor his behaviour but the teachers were telling me he was fine. It was confusing and I got a lot of mixed signals.’

However, his behaviour worsened and it 
was behavioural experts who eventually diagnosed Tom with ADHD - but not
 before a series of naughty incidents.

Mrs Sadler said: ‘At Christmas he 
wasn’t even allowed to meet Father Christmas because he couldn’t wait in
 the queue with the other children.’

Tom
 was put on medication and his condition began to improve but a low dose
 in the morning would mean his behaviour would deteriorate by the 
afternoon.

Eventually, teachers had enough - and, after being suspended five times, he was excluded from school.

Mrs Sadler said: ‘The day he was 
permanently excluded I was all out of ideas. I saw the advert for Mr 
Drew and thought we had nothing to lose.

‘Mr Drew is a real genius - he has the patience of a saint. Tom looked up to him and his behaviour really improved.’

Mr Drew and his team of specialists looked at the behaviour of the children as well as their parents.

Each day began with an assembly for pupils and families, followed by the boys going to lessons while the parents received classes in parenting.

The families would be reunited in the afternoons to attend physical education or art lessons  together. Mr Drew also worked around the pupils’ major interests, and that was football for Tom.

The boy told the Liverpool Echo: ‘Steven Gerrard is my hero. When it’s not going well he keeps his head up and keeps trying. That was what we learnt. Just keep trying.’

As well as the benefits of Tom’s behavioural improvement, the show had other advantages.

Mrs Sadler said she has made long-term friendships with the other mothers who all had one thing in common - their problem sons.

She added: ‘We were all in it together and knew what each other was going through. Some days Tom was the worst there, but all the boys took a turn.

'The boys still talk on Facebook and we’re planning a get-together soon. I really just don’t know what I would have done without the show - it’s completely changed our lives for the better.’

Now Tom is settled at a new high school 
in his hometown of Ellesmere Port, and his mother said his behaviour 
‘has never been better’.

Mr Drew, first name Stephen, teaches history and is deputy head of Passmores Academy in Harlow, Essex, which was chosen as the school for the Educating Essex documentary series in 2011. He became a star for his no-nonsense and kind-hearted approach to teaching.

Following on from that programme was Mr Drew's School for Boys, a new reality programme that began on Channel 4 last month.

It sees Mr Drew 'welcome boys and their parents to a residential summer school like no other in a bid to unlock their true potential before it's too late'.

The teacher aims to help 11 boys and their parents, but finds it tough when there is a fight before the first lesson - and he is insulted by two of them when investigating why they skipped classes.
