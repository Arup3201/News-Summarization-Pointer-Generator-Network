Childminders and nurseries will be able to double the number of children they look after under radical plans to cut care bills for working families.

Ministers are considering a move to copy French childcare rules where each member of staff can look after up to eight children. In England the limit is just four toddlers.

It is hoped that reducing the red-tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees British parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children.

Nursery staff would be able to look after more children under plans to cut huge bills for families which see mothers with a full-time job needing to work for up to four months of the year just to break even

Education minister Liz Truss today signalled she wants to tear up ‘onerous requirements on numbers’ to bring reduce nursery bills.

Britain has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, meaning the typical mother with one child and a full-time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even. Millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all.

But Miss Truss said the problem could be tackled without additional government funding.

She pointed to ‘strong examples’ in Europe where rules on staff ratios are less stringent, which would enable nurseries to employ fewer, better-paid staff.

The minister warned that in the UK 
some poorly-paid childcare workers do not have good qualifications in 
English and maths ‘yet we expect them to help our young children learn 
to speak and do their first sums’.

In France Écoles Maternelles offer 
traditional nursery style teaching by teachers in large groups of 3 and 4
 year olds and the government there is about to extend them to 
disadvantaged two-year-olds. French crèches for the under-3s are also in
 much demand, Miss Truss said.

Education minister Liz Truss warned salaries for nursery staff are being capped by 'of onerous requirements on numbers'

‘They operate with fewer staff who are
 better qualified and better paid than their English equivalents,’ she 
said in an article for the ConservativeHome website.

In France, staff are paid over 
£16,000 and are responsible for up to eight toddlers. The figure in 
Ireland and Holland is up to six children.

By comparison, nursery staff in England earn £13,000 and can be responsible for no more than four toddlers.

Miss Truss said: ‘In England, we need to move to a simpler, clearer system that prioritises quality and safety over excessive bureaucracy.

‘We also need to think about the balance between the number and quality of staff in our system.

‘It is no coincidence that we have the most restrictive adult-child ratios for young children of comparable European countries as well as the lowest staff salaries.

‘Our ratios put a cap on the salaries staff can be paid because of onerous requirements on numbers. ‘If staff are being paid barely more than minimum wage, nurseries struggle to retain and recruit high quality people.’

However, Labour warned a move towards the French system could harm the quality of care.

Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: 'David Cameron is presiding over a childcare crisis – with 381 Sure Start centres shut down, spiralling costs for working parents and less support through tax credits.

'Now his own Children’s minister says they plan to cut the number of nursery staff – which experts say will threaten child safety and the quality of care for toddlers.'

Ministers are expected to set out a major overhaul of childcare next week.

Staff in French nurseries can care for eight children, compared to just four toddlers in England

In addition to changes to staffing ratios, it is likely to include generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders.

Senior coalition figures are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £2,000 per year per child for all working parents.

The favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better-off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work.
