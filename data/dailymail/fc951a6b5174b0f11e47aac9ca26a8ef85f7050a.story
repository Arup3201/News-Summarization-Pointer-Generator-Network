A drink-driver who killed a teenager in a horrific crash tried to get his own son to frame the victim in a desperate bid to avoid prison, it emerged today.

James Watson was jailed for nine years yesterday after causing the death of 18-year-old Brendon Main in a smash that left wrecked cars and debris littered along a quiet street.

The 38-year-old got behind the wheel after a drinking session at a Newburgh hotel in Aberdeenshire to drive to his home - less than a mile away - with three teenagers in the car.

Watson - who was only reunited with his son three years ago after being estranged for many years - lost control of the vehicle (pictured, front) on Main Street in July 2011 and smashed into a parked Land Rover Freelander. The car hit the 4x4 so hard that the SUV was forced onto the bonnet of a nearby Volvo

His son Levi Watson, who was Mr Main's best friend, has now vowed never to talk to his father again.

Levi, who was in the car that night, said he has now lost two people in the tragedy - his closest friend and his father.

He revealed that his father wanted him to tell police that Mr Main, the car's owner, had been driving, so he could avoid jail.

Levi said: 'I got phone calls threatening me to change my statement, to say that it had been Brendon driving the car. He didn't want to go to jail.'

'It was bad enough that he took a kid's life, never mind asking your own son to lie for you.

'He got what he deserves in court.'

Following the sentencing, Brendon's parents Anne and Bert said they were 'disgusted' by Watson's attempt to frame their son.

Mrs Main said: 'All he's ever wanted is to come out of this free.

'The sentence he got is not enough and never will be enough. It should be a life for a life.'

Watson, Levi, Mr Main and another friend, Michael Smith, had been drinking in the Ythan Hotel before the accident, which happened in the early hours of July 24, 2011.

Brendon, who lived in Aberdeen's Cults area, had handed over the keys of his Ford Fiesta to Watson, so he would not be tempted to drive home once he'd had a couple of drinks.

Levi said: 'Normally, we used to leave the car in the car park and walk to my dad's house.

'The Ythan Hotel is only five minutes away.

'That night, he decided to drive us home in Brendon's car.

'I said I would sit in the front but Brendon said he would.

'We started having an argument - nothing serious- and the last thing he said to me was "love you, bud".'

Watson - who was only reunited with his son three years ago after being estranged for many years - lost control of the vehicle on Main Street and smashed into a parked Land Rover Freelander.

The car hit the 4x4 so hard that the SUV was forced onto the bonnet of a nearby Volvo.

Mr Main was crushed when he fell from the Fiesta as it overturned.

He later died in hospital.

Levi said: 'The last thing I remember is my dad saying "let's see how fast this thing can go".

'I heard everyone screaming and then it all went black.'

The next morning, Levi was devastated when he was told his best friend had been killed.

Two years later, he said he has had no contact with his father since the accident.

Levi said his life had never been the same since he lost his best friend, Mr Main. Above, his tattooed tribute

Levi said: 'I've not spoken to him since the night of the accident and I never will again.

'He has never phoned to see how I am or how badly I was injured. I heard he was seen crawling away from the driver's seat on the night of the accident.

'After the threats I received, that doesn't surprise me.'

Levi said his life had never been the same since he lost his best friend, Mr Main.

He said: 'I miss him so much. I'd rather it had been me than Brendon.

'In the same day I didn't just lose my best friend - I also lost my dad.'

Watson was jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.

He was also banned for the road for 15 years.

He already had a conviction for careless driving.
