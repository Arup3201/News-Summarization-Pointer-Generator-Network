The Pentagon detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has been declared the most expensive prison on Earth.

The Guantanamo Bay Prison, which opened on the U.S. naval base in Cuba in January 2002, costs U.S. taxpayers $800,000 per year per each of its 171 inmates, according to a new report.

That's more than even the most expensive four-year college degree in the U.S., and more than 30 times the cost of keeping captives on U.S. soil at $25,000 per inmate.

Facilities: A class area in Camp VI in Guantánamo Bay, where 171 prisoners are currently detained

According to The Miami Herald report by Carol Rosenberg, officials would not accommodate a request for a line-by-line analysis of expenses.

The executive order creating the Guantanamo Bay detention camp was
signed by President Bush on November 18, 2001, meaning the ten year 
anniversary is little over a week away.

The closure of Guantanamo was a 
popular part of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, but since coming 
to office it has appeared more difficult than first thought.

After setbacks due to incomplete 
files on many detainees and problems finding a place to put the inmates if the camp were to shudder, the closure of the camps is still 
on President Obama's to-do list, and its facilities still funded as an open-ended battlefield necessity. 

Sources, however, tell the Herald the operation functions more like 'a five-star resort and not a detention facility for terrorists', as Florida Republican Representative and former Army lieutenant Allen West pointed out.

This summer in a letter to Congress, 
the Obama administration confirmed the Defense Department 'spends 
approximately $150 million per year on detention operations at 
Guantánamo, currently at a rate of more than $800,000 per detainee.'

'Meanwhile, our federal prisons spend a little over $25,000 per year, 
per prisoner, and federal courts and prosecutors routinely handle 
numerous terrorist case a year well within their operating budgets,' continued the letter, written by Attorney General 
Eric Holder and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other Cabinet members
to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and others.

By that time, Congress - now tasked 
with cutting $1.2trillion from the federal budget before year's end - had
allocated $139million to run the centre in 2010, two years after the arrival of its last inmate.

Healthy: A spokesman for the prison said it 'executed $2.4M in FY11 for detainee rations' - amounting to $38.45 worth of food per day per inmate

However, the camps spokesman, Navy 
Commander Tamsen Reese, told the newspaper the prison 'executed $2.4M in
FY11 for detainee rations'.

That amounts to each prisoner getting $38.45 worth of food per day - nearly 17 times as much as
the State of Florida spends to feed its prisoners. And nearly five times the amount the average American spends on food daily, according to the report.

Inmates are also treated to amenities like satellite television, and there are plans to build another soccer field at the detention centre.

Then there is the expense of paying 
for the revolving staff of 1,850 troops, linguists, intelligence 
analysts, federal agents and contract workers.

A guard at Guantánamo can make anywhere from $2,900 to $7,800 a month depending on their military rank; a guard with the rank of third class Petty Officer earns nearly $3,000 a month.

This is in addition to receiving the same combat pay that a troop fighting in Afghanistan would receive.

Employees also have their own gym, 
dining rooms and movie theatre that, and are 
sometimes allowed to move their families to the deployment.

Due to the secret nature of the evidence, religious tensions among prisoners and high-profile aspects of many of the detainees, the camp, and those involved, have long been a point of controversy.

Most of the occupants are terror suspects, and many aspects of the cases are shrouded in secrecy.
