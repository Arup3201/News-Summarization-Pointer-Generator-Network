A construction worker lost his thumb Monday after being bitten by a tiger at an animal sanctuary in a Miami suburb owned by a convicted felon and suspected drug kingpin.

According to Florida Fish and Wildlife, the incident took place just before 2pm Monday when the victim allegedly stuck his hand into a cage housing a tiger at the Zoological Wildlife Foundation west of Jupiter.

Palm Beach County Fire and Rescue responded to the animal sanctuary off the 190000 block of Southeast Mack Dairy Road and found the construction worker with severed thumb.

Mauled: A man working on a construction project at the Zoological Wildlife Foundation, an animal sanctuary near Miami, lost his thumb Monday after sticking his hand into a tiger cage

Dark past: The owner of the privately owned zoo is Mario Tabraue, a suspected drug kingpin who was sentenced in 1989 to 100 years in prison after being convicted of 61 counts of racketeering - but he served only 12 years of his sentence

The man was rushed to St Mary's Medical Center for treatment; he is expected to survive, CBS12 reported.

The owner of the facility, Mario Tabraue, has an up-to-date permit to keep wild animals in captivity, the FWC stated.

The big cat that mauled the worker remained secure in his cage during the incident.

‘He approached the cage and put his hand in, and the tiger bit his thumb off,’ property manager Whitney Burbank told WESH-TV. ‘There are signs on the cage that say, “Do not approach the cage."’

The state wildlife agency said they have never received any complaints about the privately funded and operated zoo, which is home to at least nine big cats, four of them tigers.

Visitors to the zoo are encouraged to interact with the animals in the vast collection, which includes an alligator, different types of monkeys, birds, two different kinds of anteater, a fox and other exotic creatures.

One visitor to the zoo, 'Jen B', wrote on review website Yelp that she got to play with two monkeys, feed two baby tigers and even had a baby grizzly bear suck on her thumb

She said: 'Amazing experience best animal experience ever. best service best everything. got to play with 2 baby tigers feed camels goats, play with 2 monkeys learn and touch many different animals. didn't get rushed. great customer service. baby grizzly bear sucked on my finger. cutest thing in the world,'

According to the sanctuary’s website, owners Mario and Maria Tabraue bought five acres of land south of Miami more than a decade ago to create a habitat for exotic animals

'ZWF offers more animal encounters than any South Florida zoo,' the website boasts.

It is a completely private facility and claims to be the 'ultimate haven for endangered and displaced wildlife'. 

It is co-founded and funded by the philanthropic Mantella family based out of Toronto, Canada.

Dangerous side-business: Tabraue's drug-smuggling operation allegedly imported 500,000 tons of pot and hundreds of pounds of cocaine from Colombia, earning him $75million in profit

Sylvia Mantella and her husband Robert are understood to have got involved with the zoo venture when theymet the owner and learned he had just rescued a two-toed sloth and was looking for a home for it

But as it turns out, the owner of the sanctuary has a dark past involving allegations of murder and dismemberment; drug trafficking; corruption and obstruction of justice.

In December 1987, the Associated Press reported that Tabraue and his father, Guillermo, were arrested as part of a sting operation targeting a drug-trafficking ring that killed an informant and dismembered his body while smuggling in a half-million pounds of marijuana.

An FBI agent said at the time that when federal officials came to arrest Mario Tabraue, the suspected head of the drug ring, his wife tossed a bundle of $50,000 in cash out the back window.

The FBI dubbed the investigation 'Operation Cobra' because Tabraue owned an exotic pet store and ranch, where he kept a giraffe, a cheetah and rare birds.

During the three-month trial, witnesses recounted how Tabraue and an associate allegedly carved up the corpse of federal informant Larry Nash with a circular saw, dumped it in a horse trough and set it alight.

Tabraue's drug-smuggling operation allegedly imported 500,000 of tons of pot and more than 200lbs of cocaine from Colombia, earning him $75million in profit.

Tabaue was eventually found guilty of 61 acts of racketeering and sentenced to 100 years in prison, but he was freed after only 12 years because he was recruited as a federal informant.

Mario Tabraue was acquitted of complicity in the shooting death of his first wife, also named Maria, which followed a domestic dispute.

The case became the subject of Bryan Christy's 2008 non-fiction book The Lizard King: The True Crimes and Passions of World's Greatest Reptile Smugglers.
