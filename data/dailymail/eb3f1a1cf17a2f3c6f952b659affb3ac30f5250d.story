Killed: Lauren Daverin was discovered dead Thursday night after drinking and smoking on a local footbridge with friends

Police are searching for the killer of an 18-year-old girl who was discovered early Thursday night naked and dead on a footbridge in Rockville Centre, New York.

Lauren Daverin of Lynbrook had been hanging out drinking and smoking with friends on the Mill Pond footbridge Thursday night.

Her body was discovered by friend David Paiz and his brother Eric.

David Paiz said he left Daverin with three others, two girls and her boyfriend, at around 9pm to go get food.Â 

When he returned to the spot an hour later, he found Daverin dead and completely naked except for her boots.

'I'm figuring maybe she was beaten. She was in a very uncomfortable, awkward position. Completely naked,' David Paiz said. 'I think she possibly got raped or something too.'

He called 911 and when authorities arrived they ruled her dead on the scene at 10:15pm.

Paiz
and his brother are the only two witnesses that have given accounts to 
the media. It's unclear when the other three friends separated from 
Daverin. So far no arrests have been made in the case, and police haven't made announcements about potential suspects.

Though it is not immediately known what caused her death, police have already ruled the case a homicide and are asking anyone with information as to who might have murdered Daverin to come forward.

Investigators are reviewing surveillance footage of the area as well as Daverin's cellphone records to determine who was in the area at the time of the killing.

Friends remember Daverin as a bit of a 'wild child'.

'She was a little rough around the edges, but all around a great person,' Aaron Holod told CBS 2. 'Great to be around. Always positive energy when you were around her.'

Emily Westermann described Daverin as a social girl who had a lot of friends.

'I don't know why this happened to her, how this happened to her, but she didn't deserve that,' she said.

Daverin's family have refused media interviews, but have expressed their feelings of loss on a Facebook memorial page.

'Every part of my heart is broken, and I cannot wait to meet you again in another life and make sure I appreciate every hug and every kiss and every fight,' her older sister wrote.
