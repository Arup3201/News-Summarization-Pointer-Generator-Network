Swimming sensation Ye  Shiwen smashed another Olympic record to win her second gold last night – then hit back at suggestions she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs.

More than 1.5million Twitter users in China attacked 'smears' linking her to doping, while her father also attacked the 'arrogant' West over the insinuations.

The storm raging around her did little to harm the form of the 16-year-old – nicknamed the 'Mandarin Mermaid'  – as she stormed to victory in the 200m individual medley at the Aquatics Centre in a time of 2mins 7.05secs.

It beat the previous Olympic best for 
the distance – which she set in the semi-finals – and is unlikely to 
defuse the controversy over her stunning performances, damned by a 
senior US coach as 'unbelievable' and 'disturbing'.

After last night's race, Miss Ye faced  a barrage of questions about alleged drugs use.

Speaking in her native language, she 
said at a press conference: 'Of course I think this is a little bit 
unfair for me. However, I was not affected by that.'

She added: 'I think that in other  
countries, other swimmers have  won multiple golds and no one ever 
criticised them. How come people will  criticise me just because I have 
won multiple medals?'

She denied ever using performance-enhancing drugs, saying: 'Absolutely not.'

The teenager said she had trained for five hours a day for nine years.

Olympic organisers warned that if 
there were drug cheats at London 2012 'they will be caught', while 
Chinese team officials point out Miss Ye had been repeatedly tested and 
never failed.

Miss Ye's father, Ye Qingsong, hit  
back at the 'biased' reaction to his daughter's win, stressing the 
Chinese swimming team had gone through an especially rigorous 
anti-doping regime.

He attributed her victory to a 
combination of hard work and guidance from Chinese coaches, adding: 'The
Western media has always been arrogant, and suspicious of Chinese 
people.' Criticism of the teenager have been met by a storm of protest 
in China, where Weibo platforms – China's Twitter equivalents – were 
inundated  with messages defending Miss Ye and accusing critics of 
being  'jealous', 'sour grapes' and 'shameful bias'.

'You Brits, don't join the Olympic 
Games if you can't afford losing,' wrote one user in Sichuan. Some 
suggested it was a conspiracy by Britain, the US and Germany to damage 
the standing of the Chinese team, which currently tops the medal table.

Others said Miss Ye's swim was the product of effort and training.

Jiang Zhixue, the head of anti-doping 
work at China's General Administration of Sport, dismissed the slurs, 
insisting: 'It is not proper to single Chinese swimmers out once they 
produce good results... some people are just biased.

'The Chinese athletes, including the swimmers, have undergone nearly 100 drug tests since they arrived [in London].

'Many were also tested by the 
international federations and the British anti-doping agency. I can tell
you that so far there was not a single positive case.'

Describing Miss Ye as a 'superwoman', 
the respected American John Leonard, executive director of the World 
Swimming Coaches Association, triggered the controversy by casting doubt
on her performances, suggesting they were reminiscent of swimmers at 
previous Olympics who had subsequently been caught for using 
performance-enhancing drugs.

Lord Coe, London's Olympic chief, urged caution.

'It's very difficult to make 
judgments,' he said. 'It was an outstanding performance. I tend  to 
believe... it's very unfair to judge an athlete by a sudden 
breakthrough.'

There was support too from Duncan 
Goodhew, Olympic Village deputy mayor, and a gold medallist in the men's
100m breaststroke in the 1980 Moscow Olympics.

He stressed competitors were innocent 
until proven guilty and that there were always 'incredible improvements'
in performance at large sporting events.

Former Olympic gold medallist Jonathan
Edwards took to Twitter to express his concern, writing:  'Forgive 
personal reference, but my WR [World Record] 17 yrs old and never been 
doubted. If my nationality was different?? Point: if I can, anyone can.'

International Olympic Committee 
communications director Mark Adams said yesterday: 'We have a very 
strong drugs testing programme. And we're very confident that if there 
are cheats then we will catch them.'

Miss Ye's extraordinary swim came in 
the 400m individual medley, in which she managed the last 50m of the 
freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds 
27-year-old Ryan Lochte managed in the men's event minutes earlier.

Her victory comes after a day of fierce debate about the legitimacy of her win at the weekend, when she smashed the world record on route to gold in the 400m individual medley
