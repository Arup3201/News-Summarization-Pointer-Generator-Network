A genetic condition has left Jen Scheuermann  paralyzed since 2003, but revolutionary new technology is allowing her the ability to feed herself chocolate, give high fives and even fly a fighter jet. 

Last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (known as DARPA), unveiled the amazing results of a two-year experiment involving the 55-year-old quadriplegic woman, which they carried out in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 

Scheuermann agreed to let the super-secretive agency surgically implant pea-sized probes into her brain as they sought a way to turn her thought to actions.

Revolutionary: Jen Sheuermann (right), who suffers from quadriplegia, is now able to move a robotic arm thanks to technology being developed by DARPA 

Amazing: DARPA implanted two pea-sized probes into Sheuermann's brain two years ago to find a way to turn her thoughts into actions - like feeding herself a bar of chocolate 

The experiment was a success as the research team was able to successfully translate Scheuermann's brain movements to a robotic arm, which was then able to move on her behalf to move a chocolate bar to her mouth and make gestures like a thumbs up. 

In addition to moving a robotic arm, Scheuermann was also able to experience piloting a plane with the same technology. 

The research team let Scheuermann connect to a flight simulator, where she had amazing results flying an F-35 jet and Cessna airplane not with a joystick - but with her thoughts alone.  

While the results give hope to anyone who suffers from limited mobility, they also draw up questions about whether the technology could be used for destructive purposes - such as soldiers controlling surrogate versions with their minds, out of combat.

The ability to fly: Researchers also found a way to hook Scheuermann up to a flight simulator, and she was able to use the device to fly a F-35 and Cessna with her mind 

'In doing that work, we can now see the future where we can free the brain from the limitations of the human body,' DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar said at the New America Foundation forum in Washington last week. 'We can only imagine amazing good things and amazing potentially bad things that are on the other side of that door.' 

While the research was initially aimed at helping soldiers with motor problems, Prabhakar says they will continue to look into other ways it can be used in the military.  

'We don't want to only go play in the safe places. That would be a violation of our mission,' Prabhakar said.  

The future: The breakthrough technology brings hope to those who suffer from limited mobility
