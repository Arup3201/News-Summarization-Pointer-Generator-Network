A list compiled by genealogy experts shows some hilarious names given to some children in the 1800s

With the likes of Suri, Apple and Audio Science tossing sand at each other in Hollywood playgrounds, it's clear some modern-day parents are always striving for something a little different when it comes to naming their children. 

But it appears that  parents were even playing the originality game with their offspring right back in the 19th century - albeit with slightly less stylish results.

According to a hilarious list of historic baby names, children born in the 1800s were given names such as Mineral Waters and Friendless Baxter by their highly-amused parents. 

One inventive couple even pipped Victoria Beckham to the post by calling their child after the place they were born or conceived - more than 100 years before Brooklyn Beckham entered our lives.

Joseph and Ann Cope's child was given the name Leicester Railway after being born in a carriage at the station in 1863. 

Another young girl was given the name Windsor to go with her surname Castle, while one poor boy from Walthamstow was labelled One Too Many when he was born in 1870.

The entertaining list was put together by genealogy firm Fraser & Fraser in London, who have spent more than 40 years trawling through documents to find the most bizarre names in the 19th century.

The experts then whittled down the list to the most 10 most amusing names for children born around the UK at that time. 

Neil Fraser, 39, a partner at the firm, said the hilarious names could be interpreted as being 'unkind' because somebody has to live with it. But he also said it showed Britons had a real sense of humour at that time. 

He said: 'Our genealogists get to look through hundreds of thousands of birth, death and marriage records.

'Over the years we have picked out certain names which have amused us and we've made a note of them.

'We have been pulling them out of records for the past 40 years and some of them are quite brilliant and hilarious.  

These historic birth certificates show some of the names given to children during the 19th century, which included a child born in 1892 being called Mineral Waters

One young girl was given 25 names, representing each letter of the alphabet, while her surname 'Pepper' made up the 26th letter

Despite the most popular name at the time being John and Mary, one of the peculiar girls' names found by the genealogists was Zebra Lynes, who was born in Southampton in 1875.

Also on the list was Faith Hope Charity, born in Gillingham in 1892, and the young boy born in Hoo, Kent who was given the pronoun Time Of to cunningly match his surname Day.

One girl on the list was even given 26 names by her parents to represent every letter in the English alphabet.

The young girl, who was born in 1882 in West Derby, was named 'Ann Bertha Cecilia Diana Emily Fanny Gertrude Hypatia Iug Jane Kate Louisa Maud Nora Orphelia Quince Rebecca Starkey Teresa Ulysis Venus Winifred Xenophen Yetty Zeus.'

Her surname, Pepper, accounted for 26th letter of the alphabet. 

Another young boy born in Hoo, Kent, was given the name Time Of to go alongside his surname Day 

Meanwhile, a boy born in Strood, Kent, was also named That's It Who'd Have Thought It.

Experts at Fraser & Fraser spend hours trawling through birth, death and marriage records trying to find names of family members. 

It was after continually seeing the number of A-list celebs calling their children unusual names that the firm decided to compile the list and share it with the public.

Among the bigger list was a child who was called Prince Charles and a young boy who was given the moniker John Stone to go with his surname Wall.  There was also Frank Still Knight, who was born in Newbury.

Mr Fraser added: 'One of the people we found had 25 given names - making one name beginning with each letter in the English alphabet when added to their surname, which is unique.

One child was even called Leicester Railway (pictured) after being born in a carriage at the station in 1863

'I imagine most parents struggle to find a suitable name for their child, so it must have been a horrendous task to try and find 25. 

'A boy was named "Leicester Railway" after he was born on a carriage at Leicester Train Station.

'It shows people in the 19th century had a great sense of humour. But some of the names on the list, for example, One Too Many' Gouldstone might be seen as unkind.' 

The father-of-one, from Highgate, London, named his 18-month-old son Nelson Eugeniusz Isambard Lukasz - which is an acronym of his name, Neil.

He added: 'As a parent you like to give your child a name which you feel is unique and individual. But we should always remember the child has to live with this name.

'I'm pretty sure if a parent tried to name their child One Too Many nowadays, it would not be allowed.'
