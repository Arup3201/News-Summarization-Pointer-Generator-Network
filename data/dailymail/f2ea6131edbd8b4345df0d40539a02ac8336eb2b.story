Widespread confusion over the hosepipe ban has led to parents being reported to water companies by their neighbours for filling up their children's paddling pool.

Water suppliers are investigating reports of people using hosepipes to fill paddling pools - which can hold hundreds of litres of water - during the recent heat wave.

The hosepipe ban currently covers about half of England and anyone convicted of flouting it faces a fines of up to £1,000.

It has meant that few children in the South East have been able to enjoy splashing around in their paddling pool since the ban came into force.

Seven water companies across southern and eastern England, serving about 20 million people, have introduced the hosepipe bans, which came into place April 5.

All of the companies allow customers to fill up paddling pools using hand-held containers such as buckets, but not using hosepipes.

But warnings have arisen from campaigners saying it can be difficult for the public to interpret rules and this could lead to them being unintentionally flouted.

Campaigners at hosepipeban.org.uk, have taken a critical view of the need for the ban.

They accused the water companies of 'totally confusing the general public' and said they have been 'receiving a lot of questions regarding the filling of domestic swimming and paddling pools.'

South East Water, which covers supplies to parts of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, and Berkshire, said that 'the vast majority' of their customers have been compliant, but they have had reports of rule flouts.

'We have received a small number of reports of individuals not adhering to the current essential restrictions on hosepipe use. In these cases, we wrote to the customer about the seriousness of the drought and have not had to take further action as people comply with the ban.'

Veolia Water commented: 'We have not taken action against any of our customers and hope that this situation will remain.

'Our experience during the last drought is that most customers who were reported to us for using a hosepipe, were either covered by an exception, or were not fully aware of the rules of the ban.

They said it was 'very unusual once we have sent a letter reminding people of the restrictions that the individual involved continues to break the ban.'

Thames Water, which covers parts of Greater London, the Thames Valley, Surrey, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Kent said they have had a 'handful of calls and sent a few reminder letters, but we are not in the process of prosecuting anyone.'

Seven water companies across south and eastern England, serving about 20 million people, have introduced the hosepipe bans, which came into place April 5.

The following water companies allow you to fill, top up or maintain a paddling pool using a hand held container directly from a tap (not filled by a hosepipe):

Anglian Water

Sutton and East Surrey Water

Thames Water

Veolia Water Southeast

Veolia Water Central

South East Water

Southern Water

Covering customers in Kent and Sussex, Southern Water said: 'Since the restrictions came into force we’ve had calls from a handful of people calling to clarify the legislation.

A small number of these calls have been to tell us that people may not be adhering to the rules.

'In these cases, we would write to the customers to remind them of the restrictions.'

The company added that had not 'had to take any further action.'

Similarly, Anglian Water, which covers much of the east of England said: 'We've had a handful of complaints as the weather has been hotter over the weekend.'

The water company stressed they 'were not looking to catch people out,' and were hoping to work with customers.

On internet forums discussing the hosepipe ban, water customers vocalised their confusion:

One user wrote: 'So have I understood this correctly .. You can’t fill/top up a childs paddling pool using a hose, but you can do it buy using ‘hand held containers’, so buckets then? Is this not going to use the same amount of water anyway??

Another disgruntled customer wrote: 'So how is filling a pool with a bucket less wasteful than using a hose pipe surely you spill more using a bucket and who is going to know how i filled it up anyway?'

Legislation is in place for prosecution, but during previous hosepipe bans it has never come to this.

The hosepipe ban is expected to stay in place throughout the summer.

The weekend was the hottest of the year so far and thousands of people took the opportunity to spend a few hours at the seaside.

The Met Office reported unbroken sunshine with roads to coastal resorts clogged with extra traffic.

But according to the latest forecast it was too good to last - for the South East at least.

The Met Office today issued a severe weather warning for the area saying people can expect potential torrential rain and claps of thunder combined with a steamy top temperature of 28C.

The rest of the country will be cooler than yesterday but dry a Met Office forecaster said adding that the thundery weather will head to the Midlands and Northern Ireland tomorrow. Elsewhere it will be sunny but cloudy but further north it might be wise to pack a jumper as the temperature is set to plummet to 14C.

It's due to be more unsettled on Wednesday across much of the country and cooler with temperatures in the low 20s for most parts.

At least there's some good news for the upcoming Jubilee weekend: it's going to be dry for most places. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said weekend temperatures would be 'not too exciting' but 'pleasant enough'.
