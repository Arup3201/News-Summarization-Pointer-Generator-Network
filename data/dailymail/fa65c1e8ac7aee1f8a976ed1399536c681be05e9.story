Bloodied and bruised having been battered around the face, these are the shocking images of a cyclist who was the victim of a horrific road rage attack.

Philip Elliott, 51, was cycling home from work in Hull, East Yorks, when Daniel Miller leapt from a car and attacked him.

Miller, 22, repeatedly punched Philip and slammed his head into the ground.

Scarring: Mr Elliott, 51, said he has only been out in the dark twice since suffering the road rage attack in February this year

Onlookers feared the cyclist was dead after the horrific assault.

He was left unconscious on the ground and suffered a fractured cheekbone and a fractured eye socket.

Car passenger Miller had sunk ten pints of lager at a pub in Spring Bank, Hull, when he was collected by his girlfriend in her car.

Hull Crown Court heard she pulled in front of Philip, nearly hitting him.

After the near collision Miller sprang from the vehicle and viciously 'beat Elliott to a pulp', after which witnesses thought he had been killed.

Mr Elliott said: 'I had just finished work and was riding my bike home as normal. A car pulled up in front of me and just stopped abruptly by the kerb and this man started shouting.

'I actually thought he was shouting at somebody else. I was about to ride around the car when he punched me.

Mr Elliott also suffered heavy bruising to the side and top of the head after being punched repeatedly by Miller on his way home from work

'The last thing I remember is getting punched in the face. He beat me to a pulp. He really went to town on me. I feel lucky to be alive.

'I don’t feel safe now. I’ve only been out in the dark twice since it happened.'

Prosecutor Nick Adlington said: 'Miller blamed the cyclist for cycling in the middle of the road without lights, thereby causing the near collision.

'He decamped from the car and punched the complainant a number of times.

'He punched him to the ground and appeared to grab him by the scruff of his neck and punched him a number of times while he was on the ground.

'In between punches, Mr Elliot’s head was being banged on the floor. He was unable to defend himself and was bleeding heavily from his head.'

Miller fled the scene to a hotel in West Yorkshire with his girlfriend after the attack, shortly after 8pm on February 26.

They returned to Hull the next day and were caught through number plate recognition when the car they were driving entered the city.

Miller pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court to grievous bodily harm with intent.

Judge John Dowse told him: 'We have seen the photos of what you did to this man. You effectively beat him to a pulp.

'It was unprovoked. You left the car and you savaged him.'

Miller, an electrician, was jailed for three years and three months.

He has previous convictions for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing cocaine.
