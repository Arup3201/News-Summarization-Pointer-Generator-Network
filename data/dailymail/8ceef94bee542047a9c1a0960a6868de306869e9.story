A man told repeatedly by doctors he was suffering food poisoning has been diagnosed with cancer, and given just months to live.

Joseph McKinnon said he visited his GP and local A&E eight times in six weeks, but was reassured his symptoms were nothing more than an upset stomach.

But after losing six stone, doctors performed a series of tests, revealing the 50-year-old, from Inverness, has terminal oesophageal cancer and has just two months to live.

Joseph McKinnon has been given two months to live after doctors revealed he had oesophageal cancer. The 50-year-old said he visited doctors and A&E eight times in six weeks, only to be told he was suffering food poisoning. He is pictured in hospital with his mother Pamela

His brother Tony, 54, has flown from his home in the U.S. to be at his brother's bedside, along with Mr McKinnon's mother Pamela.

The 75-year-old, who lives in London, said: 'Joseph couldn't keep anything down. He had terrible diarrhoea and vomiting.

'For six weeks the doctor told him it was food poisoning and, when he kept going back, prescribed different antibiotics and gave him injections.

'I think he had three or four different types of tablets.

'On several occasions, Joseph took himself to A&E and pleaded for tests, but was just sent home with more pills.

'Between his GP and hospital, he must have seen a doctor eight times.

'The last time, Joseph said he was desperately ill and was eventually taken seriously.'

Cancer of the oesophagus is an uncommon by serious type of cancer that affects the gullet.

The oesophagus is the medical name for the gullet, which is part of the digestive system.

It is the long tube which carries food from the throat to the stomach.

Symptoms of the disease include:

There
 are two main types of the disease, one affecting the upper oesophagus 
and the other forming in the lower tract of the gullet.

It is uncommon but not rare, and is the ninth most common type of cancer in the UK.

There are more than 8,500 new cases diagnosed each year.

Oesophageal cancer most commonly affects people over the age of 60, with the average age at diagnosis being 72.

Smoking and drinking increase a person's risk of developing the disease, particularly if both activities are combined.

Doctors carried out an endoscopy - placing a camera down the patient's throat - and discovered a tumour in his oesophagus.

They gave Mr McKinnon the devastating diagnosis, telling him he was unlikely to survive beyond two months.

'It's so upsetting - and I'm angry that Joseph wasn't sent for tests sooner - especially as his father, Neil, died from oesophageal cancer 10 years ago,' Mrs McKinnon.

'That was even more reason to investigate further.'

Mr McKinnon, who moved to Scotland 10 years ago, has resigned himself to a bleak prognosis.

He opted not to have chemotherapy, remembering what his father went through.

Doctors want to move him to a hospice for palliative care, but Mr McKinnon said he wishes to die in the comfort of his home in Inverness.

'If Joseph had been sent for tests initially, I have no doubt that the cancer wouldn't be as aggressive as it is now,' his mother said.

'But he didn't get that opportunity so we'll never know if he could have been treated successfully.'

As many as 10,000 people in the UK die every year as a result of a late cancer diagnosis.

Survival rates for almost all common cancers in Britain fall below the European average.

The situation is of concern to the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who recently called for GPs who repeatedly fail to spot crucial symptoms, to be named and shamed.

The latest figures from the National Cancer Intelligence Network has found one in four cancer patients are diagnosed only after visiting A&E.

Certain cancers are harder to spot, unti they are in their advanced stages.

Sixty-two per cent of cancers of the brain and central nervous system were first diagnosed after an emergency admission, as well as more than half of pancreatic and liver cancers.

The figure was 32 per cent for ovarian cancer.

Linda Gordon, 55, from Aberdeen begged doctors to investigate her symptoms. Three months later a scan revealed she had lung cancer

When Linda Gordon suspected she had cancer, she begged her GP to send her to hospital.

But the 55-year-old had to wait three months for a scan, which showed the mother-of-three had lung cancer.

The disease had spread, causing tumours to grow all over her body.

Mrs Gordon, from Aberdeen, first complained to her doctor of a sore shoulder and was prescribed painkillers at the end of 2012.

But when she lost her appetite and was doubled over with excruciating stomach pain she returned to the doctors.

There, the former hospital domestic worker, was told she couldn't eat because she was depressed.

Despite repeated pleas, Mrs Gordon's GP failed to refer her for tests.

'My youngest son John had looked up my symptoms on the internet and said it looked like I had cancer,' she said.

'I told the doctor this and he said he wouldn't rule it out - but still wouldn't send me for tests. Apparently I wasn't a priority.'

When her eldest son Graeme Moir realised the severity of his mother's condition, he took her straight to hospital.

Tests revealed Mrs Gordon had lung cancer, two tumours in her pituitary gland and two in her neck.

A fortnight later, a further two masses were discovered in her spine.

After radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Mrs Gordon's tumours shrank - but weeks ago she learned that the cancer had returned and spread to her kidneys.

'It makes me angry that I had a genuine concern and that my GP didn't seem interested in referring me to investigate the possibility of cancer,' she added.
