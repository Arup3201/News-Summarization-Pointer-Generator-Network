'I'd like an opportunity to prove my innocence,' Richard DeCoatsworth, 28, told a judge today. 'If I were a guilty man, the offer the commonwealth presented would be a good one.'

At the hearing, the judge also said DeCoatsworth is too dangerous to be freed while awaiting trial, which is scheduled for November.

If DeCoatsworth had accepted the plea, 
he would have likely left prison with time served, about 10 months. 
However, he now faces several decades in prison if convicted of the most
 serious charge.

In June, a grand jury indicted him on charges of rape, sexual assault, intent to possess or distribute drugs, human 
trafficking, promoting prostitution, witness intimidation and related 
offenses in a May 16, 2013 incident involving two women.

According
 to court documents, the former cop met the alleged victims at a party 
and took them to a house in north Philadelphia where the alleged 
incidents took place.

Heroic actions: DeCoatsworth was invited to attend the speech by Vice President Joe Biden after he was shot in the face but still managed to chase after his attacker

DeCoatsworth was hailed as a hero after 
he was shot in the face during a traffic stop in September 2007 but 
still managed to chase after his attacker, who was later sentenced to 36
 to 72 years in prison.

'The shot to the face changed his life forever. It really altered him,' his lawyer, A. Charles Peruto, told the Associated Press. 'He had his face reconstructed. The pain has been immeasurable.'

As a result of his heroic actions, DeCoatsworth was invited by Vice President Joe 
Biden to attend the president's televised February 2009 address to 
Congress and sat with first lady Michelle Obama.

In a June bail hearing, Assistant District Attorney Joseph McGlynn told a judge that when SWAT teams searched DeCoatsworth's home two days after the alleged rapes it appeared he was about to 'take his last stand' as they found three loaded guns - a shotgun, Glock and revolver - as well as prescription pills and drug paraphernalia.

McGlynn said the former cop had become a 'dangerous and scary person, someone the public needs to be protected from.'

Defense attorney L. George Parry argued that DeCoatsworth was an 'addict' because of pain pills he began taking after getting shot while on duty. He also pointed out that he owns his guns legally and one of the women was a prostitute when he first solicited her.

History of violence: Before leaving the force, DeCoatsworth was involved in two others incidents in April and September of 2009 where he shot two suspects
