The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived at South Africa House to pay their respects to Nelson Mandela.

The royal couple were at the house in Trafalgar square to sign the condolence book for the former president of South Africa, who died last week.

She
and Prince William were at a royal premiere in London of a new film 
about Mr Mandela’s life when the news was broken to them.

The Duchess of Cambridge reportedly broke down in tears when she was told of Mr Mandela's passing.

The Duchess, who was sitting next to William during Thursday evening’s screening of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, was said to be ‘very moved’ when she was told 15 minutes before the end  of the movie.

And she left the cinema in tears, according to the film’s executive producer Harvey Weinstein.

‘Kate was very emotional, she was in tears and very moved by the events. We all were,’ he said.

‘There is nothing to describe the momentousness of what happened. The Duke and Duchess handled themselves very elegantly.’

But William was also struggling to contain his emotions, Mr Weinstein said.

The couple looked in better spirits than when the news of Mandela's death broke - as they watched a film about his life

‘I
spoke to them downstairs in the foyer after the movie. William was 
deeply touched by the news, you could see it in his face, but he was 
being very courageous.’

Mr 
Weinstein said that it was poignant that William and Kate, who share a 
passion for Africa and were engaged to be married in Kenya, were 
representing the Royal Family.

Arriving for the premiere, the Duchess had walked the red carpet in a floor-length white Roland Mouret dress.

She
and Prince William had smiled for the cameras as they met the stars of 
the show and Mr Mandela’s daughters Zindzi and Zenani, who had flown to 
London from South Africa for the premiere.

At 6.50pm UK time, minutes 
before the gala screening was due to start at the Odeon Leicester 
Square,  Mr Mandela died in South Africa.

A
Royal protection officer is understood to have told Rebecca Deacon, the
Duchess’s private secretary,  who was also sitting next to her, that Mr
Mandela had died.

Miss Deacon then informed the Duke  and Duchess.

William
and Kate told their aides that they wanted to see the movie to the end 
and they remained in their seats until the credits rolled.

‘Zindzi
and Zenani left as soon as they heard the news, but they did not want 
to stop the screening,’ Mr Weinstein said. ‘William and Kate said they 
wanted to watch the movie and stayed until the end. We all did. It 
seemed the right thing to do.’

The Duke and Duchess were sitting a few seats away from the British actor Idris Elba, who plays Mr Mandela, and Naomie Harris, who plays the leader’s ex-wife Winnie.

As the credits started rolling, the audience rose for a standing ovation. At this point the Royal couple were escorted out of  the upper circle and downstairs into the foyer by their  security team.

In the auditorium the invited audience were cheering and clapping, most unaware that Mr Mandela had died.

Then an emotional  Mr Elba, film director Justin Chadwick and the producer Anant Singh came down from the upper  circle to address  the audience.

‘President Zuma has announced the passing of Madiba,’ Mr Singh told a now silent audience. ‘President Zuma said Madiba had departed and was at peace. Our nation has lost its greatest son.’

Tears: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were visibly upset when they left the premiere of Mandela: A Long Walk To Freedom

As the credits continued to roll, Mr Singh asked for a minute’s silence.

Many of the guests, who were dressed in black tie for a planned after-party, were in tears.

Many were still crying as they spilled into the chilly foyer.

The film-makers agreed to cancel the after-party as a mark of respect to Mr Mandela.

The movie is due to be released in the UK on January 3.  It has already broken box office records  in South Africa.
