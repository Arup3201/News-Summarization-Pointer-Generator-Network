A medical officer is being tested for Ebola in Kansas days after returning from west Africa where he was treating seriously ill people on a commercial ship.

The man from Kansas City, believed to be in his 40s, admitted himself to The University of Kansas Hospital at 6am today suffering from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and general fatigue - typical symptoms of the deadly virus.

As recently as four days ago he was treating patients with similar symptoms in Africa. 

Tests: Dr Lee Norman reveals a man in his 40s at the University of Kansas Hospital is being tested for Ebola after returning from west Africa where he was treating seriously ill patients on board a commercial ship

It comes as Maine Medical Center puts a patient  under observation amid fears they have contracted Ebola.

The Kansas patient told doctors he did not know of any cases of Ebola on the ship but he had no means of testing for the disease.

He is now in isolation as doctors await the results of his blood test, which arrives at 5pm tomorrow.

According to the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Lee Norman, the patient was 'very weak' when he arrived this morning.

Norman insists the man does not pose a health risk to other patients and staff, and claims doctors have been heartened by the fact that he shows no signs of hemorrhaging, which is typical in Ebola sufferers.

The patient is being treated by six medics around the clock. Those health professionals will not treat other patients until he is diagnosed. 

In Portland, officials said the patient being tested for Ebola started showing symptoms two days to three weeks after contracting the virus, with a fever, sore throat, muscle pain and headaches.

Earlier today, New York City's Bellevue Hospital cleared two patients of Ebola after they arrived in ER with symptoms similar to sufferers of the deadly disease. 

Bellevue Hospital spokesman Ian Michaels told MailOnline: 'There are no patients at Bellevue with Ebola.

Over the past few weeks staff posing as ill patients have been presenting symptoms of the illness in the emergency room and are then isolated and observed. 

Staff are told at some point through the process that they are dealing with a training case. 

The city's flagship hospital is is kitted out with isolation units prepared to treat up to four patients and has the capacity to facilitate nine other patients if necessary. 

All such rooms will be secured and guarded by security. 

Technicians are assembling a lab to exclusively handle Ebola blood tests, keeping samples from contaminating other equipment.

'If we have a confirmed patient, than those patients will be transferred to Bellevue regardless of where they have presented,' said HHC chief medical officer, Dr. Ross Wilson told the New York Post. 

'Hospitals in New York City are as prepared as they possibly can be for Ebola.'

Last week a Brooklyn teenager was rushed to the hospital after showing symptoms consistent with Ebola.

The 14-year-old boy had a fever and was feeling fluish according to officials.

He was brought to Brookdale Hospital where he remains in isolation, although doctors say he does not have the virus.

The Tennessee emergency came just hours before two suspected Ebola cases, one male and one female, were reportedly taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan on Monday morning, MailOnline has learned.

The individuals, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, had reportedly been to Africa and were showing Ebola symptoms.

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation denied the reports on Monday morning.

Just an hour later, a United Airlines flight that landed at LAX from New York's JFK airport was diverted to a far terminal because of a passenger who had vomited and displayed flu-like symptoms. 

Captain Jamie Moore of the Los Angeles Fire Department held a press conference shortly after the female passenger on flight that landed at LAX was assessed, and said there was 'no reason to believe' that she had been exposed to Ebola.

He says the woman most likely had some sort of 'air illness'. 

In Nashville a woman with chest pains was taken to hospital after suffering symptoms were possibly consistent with Ebola.

The woman was inside a convenience store when she started having chest pains and called 9-1-1. 

First responders arrived wearing protective clothing and were met at the hospital by nurses wearing gloves and special face shields.

The patient was transported to Tristar Summit Medical Center for treatment. 

The woman does not have Ebola, but did indicate she may have had contact with someone who went there recently.
