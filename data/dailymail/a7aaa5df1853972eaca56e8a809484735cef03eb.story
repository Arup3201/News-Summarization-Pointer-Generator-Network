Britain is ‘leaving the financial crisis behind’ and is the fastest growing major economy in the developed world, global experts declared yesterday.

The International Monetary Fund said the UK economy will expand by 3.2 per cent this year, outstripping the rest of the G7 including the United States, Germany and France.

Growth in Britain is set to be more than twice as fast as in Germany and eight times stronger than in France while Italy is heading for another year of decline. The report warned that the eurozone poses a major threat to the global economy. ‘Among advanced countries, the United States and the United Kingdom in particular are leaving the financial crisis behind and achieving decent growth,’ said IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard.

Launching the IMF’s latest World Economic Output report in Washington, he added: ‘Growth in the euro nearly stalled earlier this year, even in the core.’

George Osborne – accused by Mr Blanchard last year of ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with austerity – said the report was ‘further evidence the Government’s long economic plan is working’.

Unemployment in the UK is set to fall from today’s 6.2 per cent to 5.8 per cent next year, according to the IMF, well below its 11.2 per cent forecast for the eurozone. Mr Blanchard warned that the single currency bloc faces a devastating bout of deflation – falling prices – which could derail the global recovery.

His comments came as it emerged in Berlin that industrial output in Germany tumbled 4 per cent in August. It was the biggest drop since 2009.

Mr Blanchard said: ‘There is a risk the recovery in the euro area could stall, that demand could weaken further, and that low inflation could turn into deflation. Should such a scenario play out, it would be the major issue confronting the world economy.’

The IMF said it expects growth of 0.8 per cent in the eurozone this year compared with the 1.1 per cent it forecast in July.

It slashed its forecast for Germany from 1.9 per cent to 1.4 per cent, halved its French figure from 0.8 per cent to 0.4 per cent and predicted a contraction of 0.2 per cent in Italy.

By contrast, Britain is expected to grow by 2.7 per cent next year – on top of 3.2 per cent this year.

‘The United Kingdom’s economy is expected to continue to grow strongly,’ the report said.

But the IMF warned that ‘buoyant’ house prices pose ‘challenges’ for a number of countries including the UK.

The IMF cut its global growth forecasts from 3.4 per cent to 3.3 per cent for this year and from 4 per cent to 3.8 per cent for 2015.

‘The recovery continues but it is weak and uneven,’ said Mr Blanchard. ‘Some countries have recovered or nearly recovered. But others are still struggling.’
