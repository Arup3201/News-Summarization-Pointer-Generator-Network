A female television anchor made the news herself when she appeared on Egyptian television wearing a headscarf, believed to be a first for the country’s state media.

Fatima Nabil read a mid-day news bulletin broadcast on Sunday wearing a cream-coloured hijab.

The Cairo broadcast was made possible after the new Egyptian regime abolished a ban on female presenters covering their hair.

Covered: Fatma Nabil reads out the headlines wearing a headscarf after the conservative Muslim Brotherhood regime lifted a ban on female presenters wearing veils on state television

During the government of Hosni Mubarak, women were not allowed to cover their hair on television however this ban was scrapped by the new Muslim Brotherhood regime led by conservative president Mohamed Morsi.

Nabil tweeted: ‘At last, the revolution has reached Maspero [an Egyptian TV building]. This decision is not a grant, but a legal right.’

The new rules for state TV were one of the first actions by the new Information Minister Salah Abdel-Maksoud.

It is estimated that 70 per cent of the female population in Egypt wears a veil, however under President Mubarak female state television employees were banned from appearing on camera wearing a hijab.

Some sued against the policy and won, but Mubarak’s Ministry of Information would ignore the rulings.

Privately-owned networks have long 
employed veiled presenters and many famous actresses have taken the veil
and continued to appear in soap operas aired on the state television network.

Nabil worked for 
the the Muslim Brotherhood TV network Misr 25 after she was barred from 
appearing on state television because of her choice to wear a veil.

With
Morsi's election and the appointment of Salah Abdel-Maksoud, who is a 
member of the Muslim Brotherhood, she said she was given ‘the green 
light’ to come back to state TV.

‘Standards
have nothing to do with the veil, which is a personal choice, but are 
all about professional skills and intellect,’ she said.

‘The
revolution [against Mubarak] erupted to set things right. Barring hijab
wearers from appearing on state television was against the law, 
constitution and democracy.’

However
critics of the new rule has said that the appearance of veiled women on
state television is merely a result the power shifting from a secular 
government to an Islamic one and has nothing to do with freedom.

State employees, they say, will still take their cues from the ruling elite, which has now switched to one with more conservative Islamic ideas.

Members of Egypt's
union of journalists have accused the Muslim Brotherhood of trying to make the 
press its mouthpiece after 50 new editors of state-owned media were appointed by the 
Islamist-dominated upper house of parliament, the Shurah Council.

A majority of those appointed were either 
Islamists or sympathisers.

Mohamed Morsi, who resigned from the 
Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party upon his election in 
June, and his former party comrades have allegedly tried to silence 
media organisations who attempt to criticise the Muslim Brotherhood.

New horizons: The abolition of the ban may lead to entire broadcasting teams wearing hijab or niqab, like this private satellite one, on state television

Last month formal accusations by state prosecutors were filed against two journalists, while an issue of the newspaper al-Dostour was confiscated by the state's censorship unit - disappointing those who believed last year's overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak would lead to greater media freedom.

In several incidents, journalists say, the newly appointed editors-in-chief have censored anti-Islamist columnists.

Farida
el-Shoubashi, a media expert said: ‘I want to see state media tell the 
truth and to stop serving the ruler, whoever the ruler is.’

‘I
don't want the state media to tell me that the president weeps while he
prays. I want to know how to the president is going to lift the 
country's battered economy.’
