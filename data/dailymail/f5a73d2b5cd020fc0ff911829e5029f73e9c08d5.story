Road closures are an all too familiar sight for many motorists, but commuters attempting to drive down this London route found it sealed off so that migrating toads could cross safely.

The road in Richmond, south west London, has been sealed off to drivers to allow the amphibians to safely reach their breeding ground.

Volunteer 'toad crossing' patrols have also been called in to make sure the mating toads can safely complete their annual trek from Richmond Park to a breeding pond on Ham Common, 330metres away.

Armed with flashlights and buckets, the volunteers, supported by Richmond Council and chairty Froglife, are on hand to collect the toads and ferry them across the road where they can find their own way to the pond. 

It has been estimated that the scheme has saved hundreds of toads by preventing them from being run over by passing motorists or cyclists.

This is the fourth successive year that Richmond Council has shut the street to allow toads to cross, with the road closure coming into effect last week.

Council chiefs have written to households affected during the three week closure, warning them they will face disruption due to the toads until April 4.

The decision to close the road for the first time was made after neighbours reported large numbers of toads being killed by traffic.

'Richmond is the greenest and most beautiful borough in London and we are blessed with lively wildlife habitats,' said Richmond Council's Chris Harrison.

New start: Richmond council has received funding to build a new pond, and they hope to encourage the toads to spawn there instead of crossing the road

'The migration is driven by the weather as the toads like moist conditions which mean it’s difficult to predict exact dates and times.

'However, we will do our best to avoid inconvenience for the public. I hope residents enjoy the spectacle of the toads as they go about their journey and would like to thank residents for their understanding as to why it is essential to temporarily close the road.'

Richmond Council has received funding from Natural England’s Higher Level Stewardship Scheme towards creating a new pond at the centre of Ham Common Woods. The Council will ‘encourage’ the toads to spawn there and avoid the busy Church Road.
