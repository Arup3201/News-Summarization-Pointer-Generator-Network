A family of four wait to meet Father Christmas by an unlit brazier in a gloomy tee-pee with a muddy floor.

This is just one of the pictures which emerged last night of the disastrous winter wonderland attraction that has sparked thousands of complaints.

Changing Rooms star Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, who created the so-called Magical Journey, dubbed the fiasco ‘Elfgate’.

Breaking his silence, he admitted it was ‘time for sleeves to be rolled up’.

Dismal: A family in a muddy tent at the Magical Journey attraction at The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield

Organisers of The Magical Journey knew their winter wonderland, designed with TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen would not be ready in time for opening but hoped visitors 'wouldn't see the small details'

The attraction closed on Sunday after only a day, as visitors complained children were left in tears by a sweary Father Christmas, elves who ‘sat around smoking’ and ‘tacky’ decorations.

Mr Llewelyn-Bowen wrote on Twitter: ‘Sorry for Radio Silence, just got back from a charity weekend in Scotland to find Elfgate @TMagicalJourney. Time for sleeves to be rolled up!’

But angry parents said his light-hearted message was unsatisfactory and demanded an official apology from the designer for ‘spoiling the magic’ for their children.

Many have demanded refunds for pre-booked tickets to the experience, at Belfry Golf Club in Warwickshire, which is due to re-open tomorrow.

The attraction was forced to close after hundreds of customers expressed their outrage on social media

Mr Llewelyn-Bowen has today vowed to take action at the park, saying it was time for 'sleeves to be rolled up'

Event director Paul Dolan (pictured) admitted the event should not have opened on Saturday as planned, but organisers had hoped guests would not spot any unfinished details

Photographs taken at the attraction show piles of rubbish and bored families queuing. It emerged the unlit firepit seen in a picture of a tent had been designed for children to burn their letters to Santa. Another photo reveals an elf wearing a waterproof jacket telling ‘a story that no one could hear’ – apparently to kill time on the walk to Santa’s grotto. A four-year-old girl, Leraya Towers from Leicester, is seen holding a baby’s rattle that she was given as an unwrapped gift.

Families forked out upwards of £50 for tickets to the opening day, but thousands took to social media to complain of being kept waiting in queues for up to 40 minutes, as elves sang songs they ‘didn’t know the words to’.

Others raised health and safety fears after spotting elves pushing a ‘faulty Father Christmas Express train’ up a hill. Parents claimed some of the Santas swore, were ‘grumpy’ or ‘far too skinny to be believable’.

Yesterday, Ellie Williams claimed on Twitter that elves had introduced her children to five different Father Christmases.

The attraction was closed yesterday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience

Sam Hinch wrote on Facebook: ‘My boys seven and three were bored waiting in tents with chav elves. Dark rooms with elves talking to children for too long. No atmosphere, songs or Christmas spirit. Builders walking around with cigarettes and tools drilling whilst we are standing there!

‘My boys received unwrapped rubbish presents, a Frisbee and a wood giraffe for babies?’

Mr Llewelyn-Bowen, who is the face of the attraction and launched it to the media last Thursday, had boasted it would be ‘magnificent’. It was also billed by organisers as ‘the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen’. But last night, a statement on behalf of the designer attempted to distance him from any criticism.

‘Laurence’s involvement has been purely creative with nothing to do with production or management of the event and we very much hope that the efforts being made will make the experience much closer to his original ravishing vision,’ it said.

Parent Chris Paintin wrote on Twitter that Mr Llewelyn-Bowen had seemed ‘happy to be at the forefront before’. The experience costs £15 for an adult and £22.50 for a child at peak times. Refunds are being given to those who visited Magical Journey on Saturday or had tickets for the days it is closed.

Others who have tickets for future dates are also demanding their money back.

Event director Paul Dolan apologised that the attraction had ‘let some visitors down’.

Organisers said the attraction should have delayed its opening because it was not ready

Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open

Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations

The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations

Customers were told of the closure via the Magical Journey's Facebook page, which was hit by a deluge of complaints from parents seeking refunds

At its media launch on Thursday, interior designer Mr Llewelyn-Bowen boasted that a visit to Santa would 'never be the same again', although he had also spoken of weather problems affecting the site 

Parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children's Christmas

Mr Llewlyn-Bowen opened the experience last week and said the festive attraction was going to be 'perfect'
