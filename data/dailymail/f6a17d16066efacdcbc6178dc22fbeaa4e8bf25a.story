Carl Froch doubts whether George Groves will ever win a world title.

Not only does Froch expect to beat his challenger a second time in Saturday's super re-match at a sold out Wembley Stadium but he does not expect the younger Groves to succeed him as world super-middleweight champion once he retires.

'George is not tough enough to succeed at the highest level,' says Froch. 'He's not a 12-round championship fighter.

In no doubt: Carl Froch is confident he will win his rematch with George Groves

'That's partly because he is not really a super-middleweight. He's a light-heavyweight who struggles to get down to 12 stone.  But it's not only physical.

'Genetically he's fragile. He's not cut out for this sport at world level. As an amateur you can become an Olympic or ABA champion without your heart being tested.

'He has the skills but not the strength of heart or mind for the top of the pro game.'

At 36, Froch is still looking ahead to a major fight in Las Vegas, perhaps against American Andre Ward who is the only opponent he has not beaten.

There is also the prospect of completing a trilogy of mega-bouts with the only other man to defeat him, Danish warrior Mikkel Kessler, who has announced his comeback from retirement.

'I love boxing and I'm very good at it.' he says.  'I get an obscene amount of money for doing it. So why should I stop.?'

Getting the job done: Froch have to dig deep to comeback and win the first fight against Groves

While he does not expect to still be fighting at 40, Froch suspects that Groves, at 25, missed his best chance of a title in their controversial first fight.

He says; 'If he was ever going to beat me or ever going to get a world title it was then. He had the gift of my mistake which let him knock me down in the first round but he couldn't finish the job.'
