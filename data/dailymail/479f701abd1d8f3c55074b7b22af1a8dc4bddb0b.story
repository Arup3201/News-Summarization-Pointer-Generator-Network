Governor of the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens cautioned investors against assuming housing prices will always rise

It is cheaper to rent than it is to buy the home you live in, new research from the Reserve Bank of Australia suggests.

The RBA report titled Is Housing Overvalued? finds that if house price growth slows - as many experts suggest it will â€“ the average household will be better off renting.

Researchers Ryan Fox and Peter Tulip compared the financial cost of renting a home with the cost of owning a similar dwelling, taking into account the purchase price, interest rates, repairs and council rates.

The report found that real house prices have increased at an average annual rate of slightly less than 2.5 per cent since 1955.

If house prices continue to grow at this level, they found that the cost of owning a home would be the same as renting.

'If this rate of appreciation is expected to continue then our estimates suggest that houses are fairly valued,' Mr Fox and Mr Tulip wrote.

'However, many (though not all) forecasters believe that house prices are likely to grow at a somewhat slower rate in the future.'

If house prices continue to grow at the average rate from past 10 years (1.7 per cent) the cost of owning a property would be 19 per cent greater than the cost of renting

The report found that real house prices have increased at an average annual rate of slightly less than 2.5 per cent since 1955

They then looked at the average rate house prices have risen over the past 10 years (1.7 per cent).

If house prices continue to grow at this level, the cost of owning a property would be 19 per cent greater than the cost of renting.

This comes after RBA governor Glenn Stevens this month cautioned investors against assuming housing prices will always rise.

In a speech to a conference of economists in Hobart on July 3, the RBA governor said some recovery in housing prices after falls from 2010 to 2012 was no particular cause for concern.

But it would be a different matter if there were to be a further run-up in prices combined with 'over-confident expectations of continuing gains' and significant increases in household debt.

Growth in the amount of debt owed by households is currently running at six to seven per cent per annum, only slightly above the growth rate of national income, he said.

'It's hard to mount the soap box to complain about that pace.'

This home in Mascot in Sydney's south-east was expected to be auctioned off for at least $1,089,000

Still he warned investors to 'take care' in the Sydney market, where most of the big rises in borrowing had been seen.

He warned banks to maintain strong lending standards.

And he warned that in making their financing and investment decisions, people should not assume that prices always rise.

'They don't; sometimes they fall,' he said.
