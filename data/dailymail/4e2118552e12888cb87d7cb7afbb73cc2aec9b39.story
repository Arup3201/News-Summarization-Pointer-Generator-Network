The National Football League and the union representing its players have agreed to a revised drug policy that includes HGH testing starting this season, the two sides said on Wednesday.

The formal agreement, which should see HGH (Human Growth Hormone) testing begin by the end of the month, comes nearly a week after the players' union agreed to terms for a new policy following a vote by player representatives.

A first violation of the performance enhancing drug policy, including HGH, will result in a suspension without pay of up to six games depending on the nature of the violation, the NFL and NFL Players Association said in a joint statement.

Wes Welker has had his suspension for testing positive for an amphetamine lifted under the new rules

A positive test for diuretics or masking agents will result in a two-game ban while a positive test for a steroid, stimulant or HGH will result in a four-game ban.

A second violation of the steroid policy will result in a suspension without pay of 10 games while a third violation will result in banishment for a minimum of two years.

The decision to test for HGH comes more than a year after Major League Baseball began testing, and long after many international sports began doing so.

Orlando Scandrick of the Dallas Cowboys has also has ban lifted after an amphetamine ban 

The NFL also tweaked policies regarding other drugs. Players who test positive for banned stimulants in the offseason will no longer will be suspended but will be referred to the substance abuse program. 

Players who test positive for stimulants during the season will continue to be banned without pay for four games.
