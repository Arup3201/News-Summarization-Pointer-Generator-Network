The woman who brought down New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner is trading in politics for porn. 

Sydney Leathers revealed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline that she has filmed three new hardcore XXX videos this summer - including one called 'My Dad's Hot Girlfriend' -  and says she hopes to make a career in the adult industry.

She's currently 'juggling porn and school,' she says. She dropped political science as a major because 'politicians get me in trouble.' 

She wants to finish her associates degree in radio and TV broadcasting to start full-time in the porn industry.

Back in porn: Sydney Leathers has filmed three new porn scenes and hopes to become a full-time porn star when she finished college, she says

'Politicians get me in trouble': Anthony Weiner was leading in the polls for New York mayor when Leathers sank his campaign with her bombshell sexting revelations 

The 24-year-old Indiana native says she hasn't heard from the Weiner since she dropped a bombshell on the married former U.S. Congressman's campaign for New York mayor in June 2013 - revealing that she exchanged dirty pictures with him, even after he publicly claimed to have cleaned up his act.

But, Leathers said she likes to think that Weiner is still watching her. He remained Facebook friends with her until December and still hasn't blocked her on Twitter, she claims.

'I think he likes it when I talk about him, even when I’m making fun of him, it’s just that he likes the attention,' she laughs.

'I think he’s seen all my new porn scenes, too.'

Leathers has pledged not to do porn again, but says she always been an exhibitionist and couldn't stay away from the spotlight

After Leathers texted her way into the spotlight last summer, she appeared in a hardcore porn video called 'Weiner and Me,' in which she played out some of the saucy scene she and Weiner had texted about. 

She followed up the adult movie shoot with surgery - a boob job to increase her cup size to a D, rhinoplasty, liposuction and labiaplasty. She later tried to auction off a jar with the discarded bits of her privates. 

In an interview last year with MailOnline, she called her first porn short a 'one-time thing' and said she wouldn't be making any more XXX videos. 

But she says she's couldn't stay away from the spotlight - and the money is too good to pass up, she says. 

'I am kind of exhibitionist and I don’t find anything wrong with that,' she says.
