Defiant: Maria Ivakova, 26, threw the excrement in a pet owner's car

A sidewalk littered with dog excrement is always unsightly, but one Russian model took her annoyance to the next level and threw the poo in a pet owner's car.

The incident which was filmed and posted on the internet, has now gone viral and has already been viewed nearly 2 million times.

It shows blonde model Maria Ivakova, 26, confront a wealthy woman in an expensive convertible sports car whose tiny dog had done a mess close to a city park.

After an increasingly bitter row filled with foul language, the model picks up the excrement and throws it at the aghast owner.

It's part of Maria's campaign on an Russian internet social site called 'Clean the poo made by your friend'.

Maria
explains in the footage: 'Hi. While waiting for a friend I became an 
eye witness to a most inappropriate situation. This is very familiar.'

The camera pans to the dog mess. 'I want to go and sort this problem,' she says.

'This is the guilty one.'

Vigilante: In the video Ms Ivakova shows her face when she turns the camera on herself (left) then runs over to the woman in the car and tells her to clear the dog poo off the pavement

The camera switches to the stylishly dressed woman in the car.

Vigilante Maria says: 'Excuse me, girl, can you......?'

The driver, who has lifted the 
offending dog into the passenger seat, interrupts angrily saying: 'Take 
away the camera, turn it off....'

Ms Ivakova responds: 'Can you clean the poo first and then I will turn my camera off?!'

But the owner does not want to leave her car and replies: 'If you are bothered with this s**t, clean it yourself. Do you understand?'

Clash: The woman is seen sitting in her expensive convertible sports car with her small dog, unaware of the argument that is about to ensue

Proving her point: In the clip the model is seen picking up the excrement off the floor,  which is thought to belong to the dog seen in the car with the women

Ms Ivakova becomes more angry and asks her: 'Why should I clean after your dog! Why you don't like me filming?!'

'Clean the s**t from your dog and I will go away!'

But the owner of the small dog angrily retorts: 'Do you really think that I will stand up and clean the s***?'

'Yes, certainly. I think even your dog is cleverer than you!,' replies Ms Ivakova.

When the pet owner swears at her and tells her to leave her alone, Ms Ivakova agrees and turns away.

But then she picks up the dog mess in a paper napkin.

She throws it in the car saying: 'Bon appetit.'

The outraged woman in the car shouts:  'B****!'

Then Ms Ivakova runs away from the scene laughing.

The confrontation was shown by Russian TV channel - though they failed to identify her.

It has now has gone viral on the web with more than one million hits since it was uploaded on July 2.

Some users have voiced their support for Ms Ivakova, but others have said she is not delivering her message in the right way.

However, Mail Online has identified the vigilante as model Maria Ivakovo.

Friends says she feels strongly about the health risks from dog fouling.

The owner was also recognised by her workmates online.

'Hey, our Yulia is in trouble,' said one message before giving a link to the footage.
