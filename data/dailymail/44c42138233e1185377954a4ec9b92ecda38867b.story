The calm dignity of the occasion was in stark contrast to the chaotic horror that had unfolded on a street in London.

Hundreds of mourners gathered to pay their respects as the coffin bearing the body of Fusilier Lee Rigby arrived at the church where his funeral will be held today.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, was hacked to death in broad daylight outside Woolwich Barracks on May 22.

His loved ones gathered around his coffin before his comrades at arms began an overnight vigil at Bury Parish Church in Greater Manchester.

Members of the public applauded as the funeral hearse passed while relatives wept as they followed the coffin into the church, and supported each other as the walked along.

Fusilier Rigby, 25, a drummer in the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed as he returned to Woolwich barracks from the Tower of London.

The father-of-one had served in 
Afghanistan and was attached to the regimental recruiting team when he 
was attacked in the south London street.

His coffin has been draped in a Union Jack flag, and soldiers have marched and stood in a procession outside the hearse.

Ahead of the procession was a corp of two dozen drummers in scarlet tunics marching to a beat.

Further up the street elderly veterans proudly wearing their campaign medals and blazers formed a group of standard bearers their flags held aloft then dropped in honour as the cortege passed.

After 25 minutes, Rebecca Rigby left the church with her son and another family member.

Five minutes later the rest of Fusilier Rigby's family emerged into the bright sunshine, walking down the steps.
