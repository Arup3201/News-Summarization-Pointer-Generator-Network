An historic Grade II listed building on one of London's most desirable squares is set to be transformed into a 'mega-mansion' worth more than £60million.

Number 52 Cadogan Square in Belgravia will be turned into what is being billed as one of London's finest recently refurbished homes after plans were submitted to Kensington borough council.

Developers want to install a gym and spa along with a 'gentleman's cloakroom', 'ladies' powder room', commercial kitchen and staff quarters in the basement of the six-story property. There is also a family 'media room', 'his' and 'her' offices and a 'women's' sitting room on the same floor. 

The six-story Number 52 Cadogan Square in Belgravia, central London is to be refurbished into a so-called 'mega-mansion' worth £60million

Plans show the huge scale of the central London mansion - which will include a 'ladies' powder room', 'juice bar', nanny's bedroom and jacuzzi

The ground floor of the  mansion will have a dining room for 20 along with a huge drawing room and wine cellar.

On the first floor, there will be an enormous master bedroom with an equally large dressing room and bathroom. The bedroom suite is so vast it even has its own kitchenette.

The second floor boasts three massive guest bedroom suites while the fourth floor has three children's bedrooms and a nanny's bedroom, all of which are en-suite.

In total, there will be around 20,000 sq/ft of accommodation - making it around 22 times the size of the average new home. The property also includes a sizeable mews property at the rear.

The best properties on Cadogan Square will typically sell for around £3,000 per sq/ft - potentially giving number 52 a £60 million price-tag.

Stamp duty on a £60 million home is £7.1 million - enough to pay for 300 nurses.

Number 52 Cadogan Square was built in 1886 for Thomas Andros de la Rue, a wealthy printer, who wanted a stunning Queen Anne Revival style home.

It was later the residence of sugar tycoon Vernon Tate, who lived there until his death in 1950s, after which the property remained in Tate & Lyle ownership and was used as accommodation for executives visiting London.

As well as 20,000sq ft of floor space - making the property three times bigger than the average home - the property includes a mews residence

But after being empty for a number of years, the property is said to be in need of 'significant refurbishment' and architects, acting on behalf of The Cadogan Estate, have submitted plans to return it to an opulent family home.

Photos submitted by architects to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council show an incredibly ornate interior, with elaborate chimney pieces, carved oak panelling and stained glass windows.

The outside, according to experts, is an 'archetypal example of Queen Anne Revival style'.

Local estate agents were excited when asked about the prospect of 52 Cadogan Square being returned to a family home, with one describing the property as a 'rare and wonderful thing'.

Jake Russell, director at Russell Simpson, said: 'Cadogan Square is generally considered to be one of, if not, the best address in prime central London.

'With the vast majority of the square being flats, the rarity of an entire original freehold building with garden square views is enormously appealing and, I expect, would have much demand.

'Being so unusual makes it incredibly hard to value, but you'd expect for records to be broken with such a rare and wonderful thing.'

The Cadogan Group bought 52 Cadogan Square and 30 Clabon Mews in 2010 for £30 million. They are one of London's biggest and wealthiest landowners and, according to company reports, have a property portfolio worth £4.46 billion.

While the layout for the mansion will remain largely untouched, it will undergo an 'extensive internal and external refurbishment works'.

The mews house will be completely remodelled with the garage large enough to accommodate a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

The end of the public consultation is Friday, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea expecting a decision by April 15.

Mr Russell added: 'Given the council are all for retaining the original character of an area, and the identity of the various pockets of Chelsea and Kensington, I'd be very surprised if they opposed the proposals to restore this building back to being a single family dwelling.

'Whilst the council have adopted a more negative attitude towards 'losing residential units' in the Borough more recently, there is a huge amount to be said for restoring these beautiful old buildings back to the way in which they were originally intended to be, and built for. What a home it would be.'

The property will have a sauna, steam room and gym, as well as staff quarters. Plans show a sketch of a Rolls Royce in the garage
