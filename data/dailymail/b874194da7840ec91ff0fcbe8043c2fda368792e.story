Killed: Jennie Leeman was shot at close range

A businessman shot his wife dead because she refused to listen to his claims that her new lover was a paeodphile, a court has heard.

David Leeman admitted shooting his wife Jennie during a heated argument in an isolated barn in Parracombe, North Devon, but claimed he temporarily lost control of his actions because he was so angry.

The 60-year-old told the court he had
confronted his estranged wife over the allegations about her new 
partner because he was worried about the safety of his children.

However, the row escalated and resulted in Leeman opening fire on 44-year-old Jennie.

Leeman said he could not remember 
shooting his wife and said it felt as if there was a second 
version of himself in the room pulling the trigger.

He said: 'My head was bursting. I have no idea why the gun came out of my pocket. All I wanted her to do was to stop and listen.

'It was like a voice saying "stop, 
stop, stop". I was saying "stop, stop, stop, stop" but the gun was going
off. She died with the first shot.

'The gun kept going off; bang, bang, 
bang, bang. I held her on the floor and looked at what I had done and 
prayed she would go to a peaceful place. I said the Lord’s Prayer over 
her body.'

The court heard how Mrs Leeman left the defendant just days before, ending their 18-year marriage.

She left him for their 40-year-old tenant Norman Laramy, who she had started an affair with when he moved into another rented barn at their complex of farm buildings, their home for nine years.

A jury at Exeter Crown Court heard they had agreed to separate and that she would have custody of their two daughters aged seven and 16, while he stayed at the farm with their oldest son William, aged 18, and a younger boy of 13.

Leeman killed his wife last September by shooting her at almost point blank range with an illegally held MAB semi automatic pistol which he had taken out of hiding a few days earlier.

He later told police he believed he was protecting his daughters because he believed Mr Laramy was a paedophile.

He had reported his concerns to the police twice in the week before the shooting, calling officers to his farm the previous day to present them with a statement written by his son William, the court heard.

The jury have been shown the statement in which he alleges he went to the barn where his mother and Mr Laramy were living and saw him looking at indecent images of two 13-year-old girls which his own son had taken on his phone.

'I wanted it to stop but I had no power. It was all black around me'

William’s statement said Mr Laramy was so engrossed in what he was watching that he did not notice he was there and that he then encouraged his son to perform sexual acts with the girls and film them again.

William when he protested and said the images were sickening, Mr Laramy told him ‘chill out and man up’, according to the statement.

However, Mr Laramy told the jury a very different version in which he discovered inappropriate images on William's phone, reprimanded him, and ordered him to delete them immediately.

Leeman admitted the shooting the day after during his first interview with police but insisted from the outset he was trying to protect his daughters from a man he believed to be a predator.

Affair: Mrs Leeman left the defendant for their tenant

He said: 'I passed her the statement from my son about Mr Laramy. I told her I didn’t want her going to live with this man with our daughters.

'I told her I was not happy about her having the girls if that man was staying in the house. I said she had to believe me and showed her William’s statement and she half read it.

'I said "listen, listen to me" but she would not listen to what I was trying to tell her and said she was going to take our younger daughter. It all got heated.

'Then there was just a big black area and then I was kneeling on the floor holding her hand and she had left me. She had died.

'I shouted stop, stop, stop. It wasn’t me. It was like part of me and I was next to it. I did not want it to have happened but it had happened.

'I wanted it to stop but I had no power. It was all black all around me. I don’t know why the gun went off. I don’t know why it did but it kept going and going and going and going.

'I wanted to blow my brains out but there were no bullets left. I did not know what had happened. There was no reason for it. I loved her very much but we had separated.

'I was willing to let her go. She had been the best mum in the world but I knew she’d had enough. I was finding it very difficult because we had been together so long.'

He said they had talked about selling the farm but decided to carry on renovating the buildings and he had bought her a personalised number plate of JEN 88 S before they split up.

The prosecution said he shot his wife in a fit of jealousy to stop her leaving him after luring her to the office.

They say he must have planned the 
killing because he had retrieved the gun and carried the loaded weapon 
in the pocket of his camouflage jacket.

Leeman, a property developer and small scale farmer from Parracombe near Combe Martin, denies murder.

He admits manslaughter by reason of loss of control and the possession of an illegally-held pistol.
