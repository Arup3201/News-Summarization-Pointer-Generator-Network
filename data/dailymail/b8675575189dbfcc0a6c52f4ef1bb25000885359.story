A 'besotted' female prison officer struck up a sexual relationship with an inmate and smuggled drugs, booze and mobile phones into jail after falling in love with him, a court heard.

Hannah Stewart, 28, fell head over heels for Andrelle Leedham, 26, and wrote him love letters while working at HMP Featherstone, near Wolverhampton.

Stafford Crown Court heard the pair met in the education department of the prison shortly before he was released on August 23 last year.

After falling for each other the couple then started having regular sex together - a relationship prohibited by the terms of her job, jurors were told.

Leedham is accused of then convincing his new lover to smuggle a package into the Staffordshire prison containing mobile phones, drugs and alcohol.

On Tuesday Leedham, from Blakenhall, West Midlands, went on trial charged with conspiracy to supply drugs between March 1 2012 and November 23 last year.

Prosecutor Gerard Quirke told the court: 'He [Leedham] is the man responsible for creating this plot using the woman prison officer he had round his little finger.

'He showed her a lot of attention, commenting on her looks and exercising the charm he undoubtedly has.

'She was in effect guarding him and knew she should not discuss things of a personal nature with him.

Also on trial: Leedham, 26, from the West Midlands, is accused of convincing Ms Stewart to smuggle a package into the Staffordshire prison - containing mobile phones, drugs and alcohol

'But regrettably she did and developed affectionate feelings towards him. She was twisted round his little finger.'

The court heard on November 21 last year, Stewart picked up the contraband from the home of Leedham's mother before travelling to the prison for work the next day.

She concealed the package - contain seven mobile phones, cannabis, anabolic steroids, whiskey and vodka - inside a sports bag she normally carried her lunch in.

The jury heard Stewart hid the bag in a cupboard in the education department where she was passed a message from Leedham by lag Christopher Lewis.

The 38-year-old told her to wait and give the package to another inmate Ricardo Edwards,31, who approached her shortly after and asked: 'Is that for me?'

Mr Quirke added: 'A prison officer became suspicious after seeing the exchange and followed Edwards and Lewis down a corridor as they left the education department.

'When approached they made a run for it and Edwards threw away the package, which had been hidden in his clothing.'

Edwards and Lewis were detained and the package was recovered, which was found to have Leedham's fingerprints on, the jury heard.

Giving evidence yesterday, Stewart, from Featherstone, Stafforshire, said Leedham had prepared the package and organised for the inmate to take it from her.

She also told the court how she had succumbed to his charm and fell for the inmate while he was still a prisoner.

She said: 'He made me feel good about myself. He told me I was attractive, that he would like to get to know me and one day would have me.

'At first I just ignored him but he continued to say how beautiful I was, how he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me when he got out.

'I believed him. I should have reported him but did not. I had started to like him.

'I wrote the letter to him the week before he was released and it accurately reflected my feelings towards him.'

The letter telling of her affections was written shortly before Leedham's release and was read out to the court.

It said: 'My gorgeous baby. I don't know where to start. It feels like a dream to have someone as sexy as you who actually wants me. I have fallen for you and there is no going back.

'I admit that I seriously love you. I really hope you think the same and it would certainly hurt me if you did not. We will be good together.

Pledge: While working at HMP Featherstone, above, Ms Stewart wrote to Leedham: 'I admit that I seriously love you. I really hope you think the same and it would certainly hurt me if you did not. We will be good together'

'I have butterflies in my stomach when I see you and when you kiss me I go weak at the knees. I can't wait until Friday when I can talk to you all the time and we can do what we want when we want.'

Stewart has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cannabis and anabolic steroids as well as misconduct in a public office.

She denies having sex with Leedham in jail and said the fling had finished by the end of September.

Lewis and Edwards have previously admitted conspiracy to supply cannabis and anabolic steroids.

Leedham denies conspiracy to supply drugs and conveying prohibited articles to HMP Featherstone.

Oliver Woolhouse, defending, told Stewart: 'Andrelle Leedham was not involved at all. You have used him as a scapegoat.'

The case continues.
