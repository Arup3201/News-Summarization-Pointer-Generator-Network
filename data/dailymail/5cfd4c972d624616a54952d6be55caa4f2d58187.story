The Army commander of a remote Alaskan base is under investigation for sexual misconduct, after allegedly allowing officers to have affairs and for permitting scantily clad women soldiers to pose for a calendar.

Soldiers at the anti-ballistic missile base claimed  Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley had created a 'toxic environment' by turning a blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct.

It was claimed that women soldiers at Fort Greely were also being allowed to trade sexual favors for favorable treatment from officers.

Even if sexual misconduct is consensual, the Army forbids commanders to have relationships with their subordinates.

Marco Morales, spokesman for the Space 
and Missile Defense Command, confirmed the commander was under investigation in an email 
obtained by Bloomberg.

Incidents of inappropriate sexual relations between officers and soldiers had increased because no disciplinary action was being taken, according to three sources, who spoke to the news agency on the condition of anonymity.

Lieutenant Colonel Miley declined to comment about the allegations when contacted by Bloomberg, referring the news agency to unit’s public affairs office.

The spokesman there directed queries to the Space and Missile Defense Command.

An anonymous complaint was made against Lieutenant Colonel Miley earlier in the year, after he promoted a racy calender featuring his wife Tracey as the August shot, alongside women from the base.

An alleged inappropriate relationship had formed between the soldier who took the photos and one of the soldiers who posed in it.

The owner of a bar near the base, defended the $25 charity calender for the American Cancer Society as 'tasteful' and said it had been selling well.

Patsy Ewing, co-owner of Clearwater Lodge, told Army Times she had received no complaints about the calendar, which features a shot taken in her establishment.

She added however, that the bar did not attract conservative customers.

Lieutenant General Richard Formica, of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said the allegation would be investigated, but that he did not believe there had been any 'wrongdoing', according to the Army Times.

He added that any potential impact on the command and its family readiness group would be monitored.

In an email to Lieutenant General 
Richard Formica, head of the Space and Missile Defense Command, soldiers
at the base complained that Commander Miley’s alleged condoning of sexual affairs left them fearing 'for our wives and even our children in this toxic environment'.

At least 16 women serve at Fort 
Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the 
ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea.

Military officials told NBC News that by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in effect, created an 'open season' when it came to sexual activity among troops.

One official said: 'It's as if that was the only thing to do' at the remote base.

It comes as the Department of Defense
increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this 
month that the number of cases has increased in the past year.

On Friday, President Obama called on 
Naval Academy graduates in Maryland to 'live with integrity' to improve 
trust in the military.

'Those who commit sexual assault are not
only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that 
make our military strong,' he said at the graduation in 
Annapolis.

Figures released by the Department of
Defense estimate there were 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, 
from groping to rape, in 2012. This was a 35 per cent rise in the number
of cases reported in 2010.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is due to 
address West Point graduates on Saturday, three days after a Sergeant at
the academy was charged with secretly filming and photographing women 
there.

Two Army officers assigned to prevent sexual assault are also currently under investigation for alleged attacks, according to CNN.

An Army sergeant first class, who 
worked at Ford Hood's sexual assault prevention unit in Texas, is being 
investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual 
contact and maltreatment of subordinates. 

In Arlington, an Air Force officer 
responsible for an assault prevention unit has been charged with sexual 
battery after allegedly fondling a woman in the car park near his 
office.

A Fort Bragg soldier who helps run 
the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the North Carolina base, said sexual assault 
damaged the strong bonds within the Army.

'This crime of violence, soldier upon soldier, it breaks your trust,' Sgt First Class Josalette R. Simmons, said.

'A lot of victims are young soldiers 
who have left home for the first time and they come in thinking they're 
going to be part of another, bigger family, then this happens. It's 
almost as bad as being sexually assaulted by someone from your own 
family, just breaks that bond of trust,' the 25-year-old who won 
official recognition for her efforts, added.

In an open letter to troops this month, Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno said the Army was failing in its efforts to prevent sexual assault.

He said: 'It is time we take on the fight against sexual assault and sexual harassment as our primary mission.'

Cases of sexual assault and 
harassment were damaging trust within the force, the general said, 
adding: 'These acts violate everything our Army stands for.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
