Kate Winslet is at the centre of an embarrassing row over drug legalisation, after her name was used to endorse a campaign run by her boyfriend’s uncle, Sir Richard Branson.

The Oscar-winning actress appears in a 17-second YouTube clip alongside Sir Richard to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary made by his son Sam which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs, and supports a campaign of the same name.

Miss Winslet, 37, who lives with Sir Richard’s nephew Ned Rocknroll, does not appear in the documentary but features in the black-and-white promotional clip saying: ‘I’m Kate Winslet and I’m breaking the taboo.’

The film, released next week, includes contributions from former US President Bill Clinton, and is understood to argue that the current approach to drugs has failed and highlights countries where decriminalisation has been successful.

Asked by The Mail on Sunday on Friday to clarify which aspects of the campaign she supported, sources close to Miss Winslet – who won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in The Reader in 2008 – said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate, but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs.

Hours later, Miss Winslet’s name and photograph were removed from a list of supporters on the campaign’s website. The campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘solutions’ to the ‘war on drugs’, including proposals to ‘fully legalise and regulate the drug market’ and ‘decriminalise all drugs’.

It was later claimed Miss Winslet’s name had been included on the  website without her knowledge or permission.

Last night the YouTube clip remained on the Breaking the Taboo website, with sources saying the actress’s involvement ‘starts and ends with [the YouTube] gesture of support for the film’.

A source said: ‘There was a  mistake, she shouldn’t have been  on there. We’ve had her taken off.

‘She doesn’t support all the things on that list, she supports the film.

‘Kate got involved with the film because of her relationship with Sir Richard’s nephew, Ned. Kate does not, and never has, used drugs.

Her support for the film is because she supports the film’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes.’

A film insider added: ‘There is  a very distinct feeling that any suggestion Kate supports the legalisation of drugs would have a very negative impact on her career.’

Miss Winslet was among more than a dozen stars, including Sting, historian Niall Ferguson and John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, listed as supporters of Breaking the Taboo, which calls on governments to ‘end the war on drugs’.

The campaign is run by the Beckley Foundation – the drug charity behind Channel 4’s recent Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial – in association with Sir Richard’s Virgin Unite foundation  and his son Sam’s film company Sundog Pictures.

Its mission statement says: ‘The policies of prohibition create more harms than good.’

It adds: ‘We must seriously consider shifting resources away from criminalising tens of millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens and move towards an approach based on health, harm reduction, cost-effectiveness and respect for human rights.’

A spokesman for the Bransons admitted Miss Winslet’s name had been used in error, but stopped short of issuing an apology.

She said: ‘Kate Winslet has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary. Kate should only have been featured in the film/viral section, where [the video clip] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error.’

Big names: The campaign is supported by a host of famous faces including Yoko Ono and Sting

The row looks set to cause acute 
embarrassment for Miss Winslet and her boyfriend of 15 months, 
Mr Rocknroll, 34, who works in  marketing and ‘astronaut relations’ for 
Sir Richard’s Virgin Galactic, the company which plans to take the first
tourists into space.

The 
couple met when Miss Winslet – who has a 12-year-old daughter,  Mia, 
from her first marriage to Jim Threapleton, and a son, Joe, eight, from 
her second marriage to Skyfall director Sam Mendes – was invited for a 
holiday on Sir Richard’s  private Caribbean island, Necker, in August 
last year.

In September 
this year, the couple set up home in a £2 million, 15th- Century house 
in West Sussex. Last night a spokeswoman for Miss  Winslet declined to 
comment.
