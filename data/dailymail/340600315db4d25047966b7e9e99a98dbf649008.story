Her own devastating fall: The beautiful estranged wife of Dmitry Kanarikov had an order of protection against her husband, who was--up until the day he tossed his 3-year-old son off a building--only allowed supervised visits with the boy

The devastated mother of a 3-year-old boy tossed to his death from a New York high rise Sunday had an order of protection against her suicidal estranged husband.

Sunday was also the first day that Dmitriy Kanarikov, 35, was allowed to see his son unsupervised after making threats about the child to his beautiful violinist wife Svetlana Bukharina.

It became Kanarikov's last visit with his son. The Brooklyn systems analyst tossed the boy some 46 stories before jumping to his own gruesome death.

'The precise nature of the threat was 
that unless she signed over the house to him that he was going to take 
the child,â€™ New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Monday.

Kelly said the couple had a history of 'domestic turmoil,'

'The
 husband was granted what I call supervised visiting rights, where the 
father only had the child in some sort of institutionalized setting,' 
Kelly continued. 'Yesterday was the first day that was not the case.'

It wasn't clear exactly why Kanarikov had recently regained his unsupervised visits.

Bukharina
 is likely grieving over the unthinkable loss of her son Kirill at a 
family home in Fair Lawn, New Jersey but has yet to speak out on the 
tragedy.

Brilliant: Svetlana Bukharina (right) was an accomplished scientist in her years at college as well as a talented violinist. Estranged husband Dmitry Kanarikov was a systems analyst in Brooklyn

Brighter days: Before things took an insidious turn, Svetlana and Dmitry had what appears in pictures to be a very loviong relationship

Unthinkable: Their son Kirill, 3, was having his first unsupervised visit with his father on Sunday when Kanarikov did the unthinkable and shoved his little boy off a New York City skyscraper

Tragedy: A 35-year-old man and a three-year-old boy are dead after reportedly jumping from this midtown building

'We're here to support our sister and please respect our privacy,' her brother Egor Bukharina told a Daily News reporter outside the Fair Lawn home.

The
 horrifying details of her husband's murder of their son and subsequent 
suicide had become all too clear by Monday, but Bukharina's own 
unfathomable fall was only just starting to be revealed.

Online records from the prestigious Rochester Institute of Technology show the beautiful Bukharina is also a trained scientist and musician.

She spent her undergraduate years in 
Rochester studying advanced mathematics and taking part in sophisticated
 research presentations and was a member of the National Mathematics 
Honor Society.

She was 
also a classically trained violinist who was chosen to perform a solo 
for her university's orchestra in their 2002-2003 season.

And she was beautiful.

Photos of her 2009 wedding viewed on Google Plus show a gorgeous bride alongside Kanarikov, her beaming groom.

One photo showing the couple smiling in their wedding clothes atop a New York skyscraper is especially foreboding.

At some point since their 2009 white wedding, things had taken a dark turn.

If beautiful Svetlana's life was once any bit as perfect as pictures and her impressive resume suggest, she has lost a great deal--first in recent months with her separation from her husband and more importantly since Sunday when what must only be any mother's worst nightmare came true for her

What made him break? It seems almost unimaginable that a man capable of flinging his toddler son off a building could also have a moment of joy such as this

They separated in 2012, but as recently as September, Kanarikov had made apparent attempts to make things right in his relations.

He wrote that month on his Facebook page: 'I want to be the best dad and husband. Nothing is more 
important to me right now.'

But
 whatever he did was not enough. On Sunday afternoon, the Ukrainian 
immigrant took his son to the 52-story building with the most sinister 
of intentions.

Kirill

 plunged 46 stories after being pushed from a ledge on the roof of a 
building on Manhattan's West Side after, police say, his father pushed 
or threw him.

He landed on a sixth floor landing before crashing down onto a
 John Jay College building next door to the highrise.

He was alive when paramedics arrived on scene, but died minutes later at St. Lukeâ€™s Roosevelt Hospital.

Horrific: Dmitriy Kanarikov, center, is seen here with his estranged wife Svetlana Bukharina, left, and their three-year-old son Kirill just three months ago in September

Kanarikov is a native of Ukraine and worked as a systems analyst for TIAA-CREF in New York. He lived in Brooklyn, but was selling the family home

In September, Kanarikov wrote on his Facebook page, 'I want to be the best dad and husband - nothing is more important to me right now'

Kanarikov was found on a fourth floor landing of the Midtown Medical Pavilion next door. He died at the scene.

He
 lives in Brooklyn, but reportedly accessed the South Park Tower at West
 60th Street and Eighth Avenue where a friend once lived, say police.

The
 Post reports that investigators believe little Kirill was thrown or 
pushed from the tower because he was found farther from the roof deck 
than his father's body - who likely plunged straight down after jumping.

Tragic: The NYPD is investigating the horrific murder-suicide. The four-year-old child died at a local hospital. The father died at the scene

Crime scene: Investigators walk out of the lobby of the midtown building where a 35-year-old man and a three-year-old boy plunged to their deaths Sunday afternoon

Kanarikov
 was supposed to hand his son off to his estranged wife Svetlana 
Bukharina at a police precinct today after a messy custody dispute. He and Kirill never showed up.

He left no note explaining his actions.

A family member who answered the phone at a relative's house sounded distraught before telling MailOnline she could answer no questions.

Investigators have constructed an opaque bubble at the place the two are believed to have been found and are now focusing their investigation on an alleyway between the tower and a school next door.

'They were pumping his chest and doing working on him, and nothing,' Luis Ortiz told NY1. 'You could tell that he was already slipping away.'

Another witness told the station the boy was wearing Christmas pajamas as he was wheeled away with paramedics trying to keep him alive.

'Being a parent of two kids myself, itâ€™s just heartbreaking,' another witness told NY1.

The 500-unit West 60th Street 
building is 52-stories high. It is only blocks from both Lincoln Center 
and the Time Warner Center.

Where they landed: The father and son landed on the roof of the building's lower base, at left

On the scene: Police are still investigating the apparent suicide

Kanarikov's body is wheeled away by the Medical Examiner's office after detectives finished examining the crime scene Sunday. Police say Kanarikov died instantly when he landed on a nearby building
