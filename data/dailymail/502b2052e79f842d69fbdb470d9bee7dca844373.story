Wayne Rooney and the England team were welcomed to Manaus by a crowd of fans waiting for them outside of their hotel.

On Monday, England manager Roy Hodgson and his players held a banner which read 'Obrigadi Brasil pela recepcao calorosa', meaning 'Thank you Brazil for the warm welcome'.

That warm reception followed the team to their digs in Manaus as fans, predominantly Brazilian, took photographs and looked on as the Three Lions got off their team coach.

There have been worries about the hot weather proving more of a problem for chasers England rather than possession-orientated Italy.

But their training at their Urca military base in Rio seems to have helped Hodgson's men adjust.
