Her partner is the multi-million-pound star of The Hobbit, but actress Amanda Abbington appears to have been less fortunate with her own finances.

Miss Abbington, who featured in ITV period drama  Mr Selfridge, has been forced to declare herself bankrupt over a £120,000 tax bill, it emerged yesterday.

The 41-year-old mother of two’s bankruptcy order was registered in the High Court under her birth name Amanda Jane Smith.

Despite her partner Martin Freeman’s 
fortune – most of it accumulated after landing the role of Bilbo Baggins
 in the three Hobbit films – Miss Abbington will have to pay off only a 
fraction of her debt.

A source told The Sun: ‘Amanda has 
done nothing legally wrong, but I am sure Revenue & Customs 
officials will be fuming on missing out on her cash, especially given 
her common-law husband is a very successful actor.

‘Bankruptcy laws recognise individuals
 rather than couples, so the penniless partner of a wealthy person is 
free to go bust like anyone else.’

Miss Abbington and Freeman – whose TV 
roles include Watson in the BBC series Sherlock and Tim Canterbury in 
The Office – have been together for 11 years and have a six-year-old son
 and four-year-old daughter. They are said to have met on the set of 
Channel 4’s Men Only in 2000.

They refer to each other as husband and wife and live in a £900,000 house in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.

Last night a spokesman for Miss Abbington said: ‘We do not comment on any aspect of our clients’ personal lives.’

Freeman secured the starring role in 
The Hobbit trilogy. The first of the three films based on JRR Tolkien’s 
novel of the same name was released in December and is already thought 
to have grossed more than $1billion (£660million) at the box office.

The second film is due to be released in December this year.

Miss Abbington’s bankruptcy 
declaration comes only a few weeks after that of 36-year-old former 
EastEnders star Martine McCutcheon, with debts of £187,000.

The actress,
 who is believed to have earned up to £250,000 a year at the height of 
her popularity in the BBC 1 soap, made the petition in her given name, 
Martine Kimberley Sherrie Ponting.

Her discharge from bankruptcy is set for January next year and KPMG has been appointed as her trustee.

Her bankruptcy came a few months after
 she married musician Jack McManus, 29, on the shores of Lake Como in 
Italy.

In 2003 it was reported that she was worth £1.5million and was 
living in upmarket Kensington, West London.
