In order to use many websites and social networks, you have to forfeit a certain amount of your privacy.

But one San Diego firm is willing to pay you for the privilege of following you around as you browse the web, make searches and use social networks.

For $100 (£60) a month, Luth Research will track your every move online before selling it to the highest bidder, typically companies looking to advertise on the web.

The ZQ Intelligence scheme is run by San Diego-based Luth Research. It pays preselected participants a monthly fee to collect their data, including website visits, search entries and time spent on social networks when using a phone, tablet (stock image pictured) or PC

In February, Datacoup became the first personal data marketplace.

It lets people sell their social media habits, searches and even how much they use online banking for a reward of up to $8 a month.

The more data that’s shared, the more money people can earn.

In a similar way to Luth Research, Datacoup analyses this information to spot trends and sells this trend information to advertisers. 

Only preselected participants can take part in the scheme, and around 20,000 PC users and 6,000 smartphone users are, at any given time, giving their permission to be tracked.

As well as tracking browsing history, web searches, time spent on social networks and the user’s location, participants are also asked to complete survey questions about their behaviour.

This means clients can ask participants follow-up questions about why they choose to visit certain sites, or more details about their movements.

All the information is collected through a virtual private network connection, and the data is securely routed through Luth Research’s servers.  

The firm also tracks a user’s location, and participants can be asked to complete survey questions about their behaviour to help companies learn more about their decision-making process. All the information is collected through a virtual private network connection, and the data is securely routed through Luth Research’s servers

It is then collected and analysed for trends, and works across PCs, phones and tablets.

Participants and clients should contact the company if they want to be involved in the scheme.
