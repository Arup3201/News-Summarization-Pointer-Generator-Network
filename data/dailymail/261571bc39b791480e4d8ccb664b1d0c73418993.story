Harry Redknapp launched a scathing attack on the absent Adel Taarabt — calling the Morocco forward fat and lazy.

Taarabt has featured just three times for QPR this season and was loaned out last season to both Fulham and AC Milan. 

The 25-year-old has been criticised for his lack of fitness by Redknapp this season, but the QPR boss did not hold back after the defeat by Liverpool.

Redknapp blasted Taarabt, who posted pictures on Instagram before and after the Liverpool game, as he explained his omission, saying: 'He's not injured. He's not fit. He's not fit to play football unfortunately. He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did.

'I pick people who want to try, who come in every day and work, train and show a good attitude. When he starts doing that, if he ever can, maybe he'll get a game. I can't protect people who don't want to run and train, and are about three stone overweight.' 

'What am I supposed to say? Keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train?'

Redknapp twice watched his side throw away a point in a frantic period of injury time at Loftus Road.

He was livid with his side's defensive discipline in the final minute of injury time, as Liverpool scored the winner on a quick counter attack after Leroy Fer had wasted a QPR free-kick.

'It was a bit of naivety,' said Redknapp. 'When you have a free-kick in shooting range you have to decide what to do.

'There's no point getting loads of men forward if you're going to shoot, as you'll get caught at the back.

'You have to get organised, and not get done on the counter-attack.'

Despite the loss, Redknapp, who lost Sandro (groin) and Nedum Onuoha (hamstring) to injuries, was optimistic about his side's display.

The QPR manager's position has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, but he said: 'There isn't anyone who could do any better here than me.'

Struggling to recover from a string of ankle injuries, Redknapp said Taarabt is 'about three stone overweight'

When asked about the current fitness status of the QPR midfielder:  

'No, he's not fit: he's not fit to play football, unfortunately.

'He played in a reserve team game the other day, and I could have run about more than he did.

'So no, I can't pick him.

'I pick people that want to try, and deserve to be at a good football club like QPR, and want to work, and come in every day and want to work, and train, and show a good attitude.

'And that's what I got today from the players.

'When he starts doing that, whether he ever can do it, maybe he'll get a game.

'The other lads, I've got a fantastic group of lads here, absolutely superb, all of them.

'I can't keep protecting people who don't want to run about and train, who are about three stone overweight.

'What am I supposed to keep saying, keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train?

'What's the game coming to?

'The others are as good as gold.'
