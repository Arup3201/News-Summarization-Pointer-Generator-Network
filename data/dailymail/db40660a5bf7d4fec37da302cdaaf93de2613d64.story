First it was Apple's fingerprint sensor that got tech fans all flustered and then there was the more recent rumour that Samsung's next phone could come complete with iris-scanning technology.

But now, thanks to an app, you don't need to but a new phone to get a futuristic unlocking feature.

New Android software now allows you to unlock your phone using your ear.

The Android app claims that a person's earprint is as unique as their fingerprint and that it is more convenient to use. Biometrics is an increasingly popular area of development in mobile technology

U.S. based company Descartes Biometrics claims their 'biometric authentication application' is a 'robust and reliable mobile device security solution'.

Use passwords of eight characters or more with mixed types of characters

Use passphrases -- short words with spaces or other characters separating them

It's best to use random words rather than common phrases. For example, "cakes years birthday" or "smiles_light_skip?"

Avoid using the same username/password combination for multiple websites. 

The company also claims that a person's ear print is as unique as their fingerprint.

As with a fingerprint sensor, the patent-pending app verifies an phone owner's identity against a profile stored on the device before granting access it.

An owner's identity is then checked against ear measurements as well as the manner - such as the angle - in which the phone is placed against the face.

Biometric technology is gaining popularity in the mobile phone industry, with various companies experimenting with innovative ways to make technology more responsive and tailored its user.

Earlier this month Samsung’s executive vice president Lee Young Hee announced that the firm was looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April.

The app, costing £2.50 ($3.99), also monitors the way a phone owner moves the phone to their face - checking the angle at which it rests on the users face, for example

Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured

Lee also discussed the possibility of a future model that could feature iris-recognition technology, but he did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not.

Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have already created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner that, they claim, could replace all passwords for you electrical devices.

The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code.

The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately.

Different body parts are more reliable than others when it comes to identification. Voice recognition, for example, is far less secure than facial recognition, while iris scanning technology is even more surperior

Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile.

Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access.

According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans.

Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around £150 ($250) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced.
