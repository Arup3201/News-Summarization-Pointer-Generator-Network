Hero: Kenneth Brown was shot dead as he tackled a gunman at a Las Vegas nightclub

A stand up comedian was killed as he left a Las Vegas nightclub after trying to tackle an armed man who had just shot the club manager and a bouncer.

Kenneth Brown, 40, has been hailed as a hero by Metro police after he was shot twice attempting to stop the gunman at the entrance to Drai's After Hours nightclub inside Bally's Casino.

But while Mr Brown's mother describes her son's death as 'an unbearable pain', she said she has no ill will against the man accused of killing him.

Norma Sattiewhite told News 3: 'I wouldn't wish this on any mother, father, sister, brother, anyone.

'But I have no hate for the man. I have to love no matter what and pray for him - and I do.'

Police believe that Mr Brown, who moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles last year to be closer to his mother, saw Benjamin Frazier, 41, shoot a bouncer and a security guard in an argument about payment to get into the club.

Brown, who also worked as a club promoter, rushed to the pair's aid and attempted to jump on the alleged gunman but was also shot.

He later died in hospital.

The manager and the security guard, who were shot in the arm and the stomach, both survived the shooting.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie described Mr Brown as a hero.

He said: 'Security professionals and a heroic patron who lost his life prevented what could have been even more death and injury.'

Police said the club, which has a capacity of about 500 people, doesn't have metal detectors at the entrance.

The club, open between Thursday and Sunday from 1am to 9am, has been an after-hours attraction at the heart of the Strip since the late 1990s.

It moved earlier this year from the former Bill's Gamblin Hall, which is undergoing renovations, to Bally's across the street.

Drai's is expected to move back to the renovated and renamed site next year.
