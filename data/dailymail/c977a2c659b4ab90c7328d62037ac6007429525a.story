It is one of the world's most successful companies built on it's famous motto 'Don't be evil'.

But a report by Business Insider says rather than peace and love, Google is filled with fierce relationships that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones.

Behind the modern glass doors of the internet giant's California headquarters are complex stories of sex and intrigue.

One member of staff told Business Insider: 'Inside Google, it's a Game of Thrones.'

A report suggests Google is filled with sex scandal and political intrigue that would not be out of place in Game of Thrones, starring Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister

Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where insiders say bosses are trying to clamp down on in-fighting

Former staff told the website that the politicking that goes on behind the scenes is reminiscent of the secret networking in the famous book and television series.

According to sources quoted by Business Insider, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin actively encouraged loud and angry debate among their subordinates.

But divisions within the company's various strands have now reportedly become so deep, that bosses are now trying to stamp out the in-fighting that was once so encouraged.

Business Insider said that during a conference in Napa Valley in February, Page told senior executives that the warring had to stop and there would be 'zero tolerance for fighting.'

The alleged change in stance comes after rumoured rivalries between the likes of former search and product executive Marissa Mayer, who is now CEO of Yahoo, and Salar Kamangar, CEO if YouTube.

It was not only the networking and politicking that has been likened to Game of Thrones, in which mythical aristocracy and royalty battle for the crown.

The book and series' sex and dangerous liaisons also has similarities to life at Google, according to insiders.

The
most famous recent 'scandal' involved married Google co-founder Sergey 
Brin who, it emerged last month, had an affair with Google Glass 
employee Amanda Rosenberg.

She had also previously dated Google executive Hugo Barra, according to reports.

Although Google has a written code of conduct involving relationships with colleagues, staff say bosses mostly turn a blind eye.

The internet giant's code states: 'If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.

‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google?

‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’

However, as Business Insider states, in Douglas Edwards' book about the launch of the company 'I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions Of Google Employee Number 59' relationships with co-workers were common.

Mr Edwards quotes HR worker Heather Cairns as saying: 'hormones were flying and not everyone remembered to lock their doors.'

But as one Google worker told Business Insider: 'In a place like Google, which has strong technical talent as well as business talent, it's very natural that people are going to be attracted to one another.'

Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
