Business: Simon Geddes, a former council IT specialist, and his wife Joanne, pictured together, made counterfeit T-shirts and  bags in their home

A couple made £180,000 by selling fake Disney, One Direction and Justin Bieber merchandise in an online scam from their living room. 

Simon Geddes, 44, a former council IT specialist, and his wife Joanne, 42, made counterfeit T-shirts and gym bags in their home in Sedgley, West Midlands.

They printed Disney, Hello Kitty, Justin Bieber and One Direction logos on to merchandise before selling them on Amazon and eBay, a court heard yesterday.

The Geddes', who used a stolen laptop for operation, earned £180,000 from the illegitimate business, with the purchases being processed through Paypal.

The couple were spared jail at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday. 

The court heard how they had initially set up a legitimate enterprise called 'Baby Smiles' to sell personalised gifts.

They later started offering fake goods to unsuspecting customers that were printed with trademarked logos downloaded from company websites without permission.

The images were transferred onto the items using heat presses before being sold online using a  laptop stolen from Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, where Mr Geddes used to work.

Mrs Geddes admitted 23 offences relating to making and possessing items with intention to sell counterfeit goods, and one offence of money laundering between July 2011 and November 2012.

Mr Geddes pleaded guilty to 11 offences of aiding and abetting his wife to make counterfeit goods, and one offence of money laundering.

The pair  were both sentenced to 15-month jail terms for each offence, suspended for two years yesterday. Recorder Sandra Bristoll also ordered the couple to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work.

Prosecutor Mark Jackson told the court the crimes came to light after Newport City Council made test purchases of items from eBay.

He said: 'At about the same time Dudley Council had a number of complaints about Baby Smiles' goods.

'The whole investigation was passed to Dudley Trading Standards. On November 22, 2012 officers with a search warrant went to the property.

'A number of counterfeit items were seized and heavily packaged parcels ready to post were opened. Each had counterfeit goods inside.'

Stephen Amblet, defending Joanne Geddes, who used to work in a bank, said the the pair had been naive.

He added: 'This business pays tax and is registered for VAT.

'The problem is that she did not know she was doing anything wrong or she would have checked.'

The court also heard the business www.babysmiles.co.uk is still trading, but in legitimate goods.

After the case, Dudley Council's cabinet member for legal matters Councillor Rachel Harris said: 'We take incidents of counterfeit goods being sold very seriously and work very hard to bring offenders to justice.

'We were made aware that one of our staff was involved in such activities in his own time and away from the workplace, and a full and thorough investigation took place.

'The former employee was dismissed as an ICT project manager in February 2013.

'The offences were dealt with at Wolverhampton Crown Court and we are pleased this matter has finally concluded.'
