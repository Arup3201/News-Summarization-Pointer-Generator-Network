Esther Rantzen has fully embraced her new title as a dame by commissioning her own coat of arms

As the TV presenter known for introducing knobbly vegetables and talking dogs to the nation, Esther Rantzen admitted she was as shocked as anybody when she was made a Dame in the New Year’s Honours List.

But now the 74-year-old has fully embraced her new title – and decided to commission her own coat of arms.

The former That’s Life! host, who received her damehood for charity work, has been in contact with the Royal College of Arms about producing a design based on her long career.

‘I have asked them about how long it takes and the cost,’ she said. ‘The bad news is it could be a year and about £4,000.’

So while she waits, The Mail on Sunday has stepped in to create an idea of what it could look like, complete with a motto that reads ‘that’s life’ in Latin

When we presented her with the design, Dame Esther was delighted. ‘It is terrific and wonderful’ she said last night.

‘I’m completely thrilled, it sums me up. Sic Vita Est – I like that motto.’

Our version might seem cheeky, but it incorporates elements Dame Esther wanted for her insignia – even the big teeth for which she is famed. ‘I would like a blue stocking because of my Somerville College connection, a big pair of teeth, a phone for ChildLine, a knobbly vegetable and a talking dog from That’s Life,’ she said.

The Royal College of Arms say there are no fixed criteria of eligibility for an official coat of arms, ‘but such things as awards or honours from the Crown... are taken into account.’ Dame Esther said: ‘I will put my crest of arms on the mantelpiece and maybe have it engraved on the windows of my house in London and the New Forest.

‘I don’t want to be flash but maybe I could have it on the bonnet of my small Lexus, like they do with a Rolls-Royce.’

A coat of arms is also a throwback to her first on-screen job in television. ‘The first thing I did when I worked on Braden’s Week in 1968 was research about coat of arms,’ she said. ‘So this has been a suppressed ambition of mine for nearly 46 years. It is wonderful. I would never have dreamed of it. And it is all because of ChildLine and The Silver Line [a similar helpline for the elderly].’ 

The Mail on Sunday’s highly trained heraldic experts (well, our in-house artist) created this crest with the motto ‘that’s life’ in Latin

Our crest for Dame Esther includes elements of her career such as her distinctive teeth; oddly-shaped carrots and the dog who said ‘sausages’ from That’s Life!; and a phone to represent ChildLine. 

Stockings represent her once all-female Oxford college Somerville; ‘bluestocking’ is an old term for an educated woman.

She explained that the cost of getting a coat of arms was high ‘because it requires a lot of attention; it involves artists and craftsmen and it’s on vellum’.

Vellum is traditionally made from calf’s skin, but Dame Esther said she wouldn’t want a coat of arms if it compromised her stance against animal cruelty.

Speaking about adjusting to life as a Dame she added: ‘My children call me Dame Mum, and the shoe store LK Bennett call me Miss Esther Dame. Being called Dame is disconcerting. It takes some getting used to.’

She will visit Buckingham Palace to officially receive her honour sometime in the next six months but is concerned about how she will pull off a hat in front of royalty. She said: ‘I don’t know if it will be the Queen or Prince William. I’m more worried about what hat to wear. I look worse in hats than Cilla Black.’

Coincidentally, William’s in-laws, the Middleton family, got their own coat of arms just before the 2011 Royal Wedding.
