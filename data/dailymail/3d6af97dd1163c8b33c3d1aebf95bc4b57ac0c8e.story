A Utah mother-of-five who was diagnosed with terminal cancer while 26-weeks pregnant and refused treatment to save her baby died on New Year's Eve. 

Kathy Taylor, 34, died in her home about 4pm after being diagnosed with melanoma in late August, her husband Nathan wrote on her blog, Kathy's Miracle.  

Doctors told Kathy she had cancer while she was pregnant with her sixth child, Luke. As the cancer spread throughout her body, Kathy refused treatment for fear of hurting her baby.

Because of the cancer, she was forced to give birth shortly after the diagnosis. Luke was born in September 11, 14 weeks premature.

He died two weeks later from an infection.

National Attention: Kathy's story drew national attention, even singer Sarah McLachlan donated proceeds of a song Taylor covered to help with medical costs

In the post, Nathan described how he and his wife's parents discovered she had passed away. He said he fainted when he learned the news.

'As I realized [Kathy] had gone, I gathered her in my arms and embraced her. I could not believe it,' Nathan wrote.

'I was so sad that I had been asleep and not been with her when she passed. I was so sad it was already goodbye.' 

Kathy defied the odds. When she was diagnosed with the dangerous skin cancer while carrying her sixth child, Luke Taylor, doctors gave her only days, then weeks, to live.

Defied Expectations: Kathy defied doctor's expectations, holding on for weeks then months with the deadly skin cancer

Kathy pushed through for months, exceeding doctor's expectations, but, truly amazing was the woman's absolute selflessness.  

However, when her liver began to fail, Kathy was forced to deliver baby Luke on September 11.

A post on the blog, chronicling the woman's journey, details Kathy's amazing sacrifice.

The post reads: 'With an inability to save herself, Kathy is devoting her strength to giving birth to the little one inside…one last act of selfless love.'

The mother prolonged the delivery as long as she possibly could.

Baby Luke was born weighing only 1 pound and 15 ounces, doctors whisked him to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and gave Kathy about a day to live, FOX reports.  

Against doctor's expectations, Kathy got to hold and embrace her infant son, who died on Sept. 27.
