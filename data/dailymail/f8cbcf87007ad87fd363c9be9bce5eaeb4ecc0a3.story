Tulisa Contostavlos could lose up to £1million following allegations she fixed an £800 cocaine deal.

The former X Factor judge's biggest contract with clothing firm Bank is now being 'reviewed' following a report that she helped arrange a drug deal between an undercover reporter and her friend Mike GLC.

Bank, which is owned by JD Sports, is now said to be considering pulling the 24-year-old's range TFB and her image from marketing campaigns.

Shamed: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured with Mike GLC on May 29, is in hiding following the revelations

A statement by Bank to the Daily Mirror read: 'Following the news that has unfolded 
this weekend concerning Tulisa - Bank Fashion are currently reviewing 
their options regarding her continued involvement with Bank and her 
clothing range TFB.'

Parent company JD Sports added: 'We are deeply concerned by the allegations regarding Tulisa’s actions.

'We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to do so as it develops.'

Following Sunday's revelations in The Sun newspaper, Tulisa's spokesperson has declined to comment and she has been holed up in her £6million Hertfordshire mansion.

Under review: Tulisa's contract with clothing firm Bank is now being looked at following the revelations

On Monday, police officers were spotted arriving at the singer's home, before she was visited by her PA Gareth Varey.

The report on Sunday claimed that the former X Factor judge boasted to a tabloid reporter about her links to drugs and claimed to be able to get hold of 'whatever you want'.

During one meeting, Tulisa told the reporter: 'Half my phone book sells it. Of course I can get it for you. Half the guys I know are drug dealers.'

The N-Dubz star also revealed her best friend is a 'massive cocaine dealer'.

And that brag was proved correct when her pal - Mike GLC - allegedly sold £800 worth of the Class A drug to the undercover reporter after Tulisa had sent text messages to him to sort the deal out.

During an evening out, the singer was asked if she could get hold of some cocaine, to which she replied 'yes, definitely'.

She then gave him a number and gave the reporter instructions to call him and say he was her friend and he 'will sort you out'.

The reporter then spoke to Mike, who said he only supplied wholesale quantities of the drug and eventually agreed to sell half an ounce for £800, with an added £20 for delivery costs.

Since the scandal broke, Mike has been busy promoting his music career by tweeting links to his videos.

On Monday, he tweeted: 'What do d**k head artist thinks the rules changed because I'm in this madness keep making video and talking my name that's all I'm saying (sic).'

Meanwhile, further revelations from The Sun's reporter's interview with Tulisa suggest she ended her relationship with footballer Danny Simpson in an argument over Christian Louboutin heels.

She said the former Newcastle United player was furious after she placed a pair of the £1,000 shoes he had bought her in a Tesco plastic bag.

Tulisa claimed Danny said he was normally thanked for buying Louboutins for women with a sex act.

The Sun also reported Tulisa claimed that Danny had been a 'fan' of hers for years and his intellect was below hers.

Love split: Tulisa split from footballer Danny Simpson last month

She said: 'He was obsessed for six years. He had a massive crush on me. Finally he found somebody who knew me. He wasn’t a celebrity until he met me. He was a famous footballer but not a celebrity. As soon as he got with me, he became a celebrity footballer...

'He’s not as intelligent as me. And he’s very shallow and I’m very real.'

Tulisa and father-of-two Danny started dating last autumn, but split last month.

The singer confirmed her newfound single status in a Twitter statement last week when she was pictured partying in Marbella with a host of male pals, including Mike GLC.

She wrote: 'Wow, I'm a 24 year old single girl and I had a convo with a dude on holiday and any more then that I'm sure it would be all over the papers,considering I can't take a p**s with out sum1 printing it. Let me breath man lol (sic).'
