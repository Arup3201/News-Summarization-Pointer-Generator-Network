The New York teenager who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his lunch breaks at school has apologized on video for 'making it all up'.

Mohammed Islam, 17, a Stuyvesant High School senior, told New York magazine's Jessica Pressler that he had earned millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures, and small to mid-cap equities

But after the magazine ran the interview and his story made international headlines, the student quickly backtracked, hiring a pricey crisis PR firm and battle-tested attorneys to spread the word. 

Now, he has released a video, via 5WPR, saying he is 'sorry for anyone who may have been hurt' and that he simply 'gave into [the reporter's] pressures of wanting more and more and more'.

Apology: Mohammed Islam - who gained overnight fame after telling a reporter he had made $72million trading stocks on his school lunch breaks  - has released a video (above) in which he apologizes for 'making it all up'

Going back: Mohammed (pictured center, in glasses) told New York magazine's Jessica Pressler that he had earned millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School

In the footage, Mohammed, dressed in a suit, said: 'I am sorry for anyone who may have been hurt by this story.Most of all I’m sorry for the embarrassment and the pressure I’ve caused my family.

'My dad's always taught me to be truthful and I went against everything he said, and I can't even speak properly to him anymore.

He continued: 'I've always dreamed of one day starting a business and becoming wealthy, but at the age of 17, I spend my recreational time doing simulated trades. 

'While I’ve had really successful simulated trades, my financial prowess has not been practiced and fine tuned in the real world.'

The teenager dismissed the magazine's claim he had used his enormous fortune to purchase a Manhattan apartment and a BMW, saying: 'I live with my family in Queens.'

He added he had been 'naturally excited' by the chance to feature in New York magazine, and 'did not realize' the consequences of 'giving into the pressure' and 'pretending to be someone I'm not'.

Apology: Now, Mohammed has released a video, via 5WPR, apologizing for his actions. It comes just hours after New York magazine issued its own apology (pictured), admitting it had been 'duped' by the teenager

Mohammed's apology comes just hours after New York magazine issued its own apology to it readers, admitting it had been 'duped' by the teenager.

In a statement, the magazine said: 'As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account.

'After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended.

Criticized: The writer of the article, Jessica Pressler, has come under fire for failing to fact check

'But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified.'

It concluded: 'We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers.'

Hours after the magazine's interview with Mohammed - president of the Stuyvesant's investment club - was picked up by global news outlets on Sunday, the student came clean. 

Surrounded by his new PR and legal entourage, Mohammed told the New York Observer that not only was his supposed $72million fortune false, but he has never made any money in the stock market at all.

'[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades,' he said.

Mohammed's comments sparked a wave of online criticism, with many social media users and other journalists accusing Ms Pressler of failing to carry out appropriate fact checks for her article.

The Observer's Ken Kurson wrote: 'Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.'

Helaine Olen of the Pacific Standard  demanded via Twitter that Ms Pressler came up with some answers to how she and her publication managed to pass off the seeming impossibility as fact.

'OK. Here goes ... did he show statements? I have a 15 yr old so I want to believe,' Olen tweeted.

Not a multi-millionaire: Surrounded by his PR and legal entourage, Mohammed told the New York Observer that not only was his supposed $72million fortune false, but he has never made any money in the stock market

Fighting back: In response to the Observer's article, Ms Pressler claimed she saw statements backing up the rumors about Islam's wealth. But he argued they were only rumors and he's never even traded a stock

Defending her work: The online bickering began when the New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact. Above, Ms Pressler appears to hit back at the Post's version of the article, tweeting 'MY story is true'

Ms Pressler responded to the criticism through Twitter on Monday morning. 'We saw a bank statement confirming the eight figures, & I'm comfortable with what's in the piece,' she wrote.

In the wake of the controversy New York Magazine added an editor's note to qualify their now contentious article - which was later edited to include the full apology. 

'Our story portrays the $72 million figure as a rumor; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades,' the note said.

'However, Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures, and he confirmed on the record that he’s worth eight figures.'

So, as the Observer and everyone else wants to know: where did Pressler come up with the $72 million figure? In Islam's own words, 'The number’s a rumor.'

Indeed, Pressler does not state the $72 million figure as fact in her original article. 

However, the online bickering began when the  New York Post picked up the story and ran it as fact with the captivating headline, 'High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.'

'A thing that I have learned today is that @nypost still drives a remarkable amount of international news coverage,' Ms Pressler tweeted on Monday.

Talking the talk: Mohammed (pictured giving a high school TED talk) said his parents are not speaking to him

Also on Monday, Mohammed was due to appear on CNBC on Monday morning to talk about his fantastical skills on the stock market. In light of his new found infamy, that slot was canceled. 

Speaking to the Observer, the teenager said: 'My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me.

'They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.'
