Education Secretary Nicky Morgan yesterday accused her Labour opposite number of calling her ‘love’ in the House of Commons.

Labour’s Tristram Hunt allegedly made the remark during a Parliamentary debate last week.

Mrs Morgan raised the comment when asked about sexism in Parliament in an interview to mark International Women’s Day.

Nicky Morgan today claimed she was condescendingly called 'love' in the House of Commons by her Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt

A Tory source said of shadow education secretary Mr Hunt last night: ‘He ought to think what sort of message it sends to young girls in the classroom to see him use chauvinist put- downs to one of the most senior women in government.’

In the interview with Sky News, Mrs Morgan also defended David Cameron against accusations of sexism, calling him a ‘feminist’. 

Mr Cameron came under fire in April 2011 after he responded to heckling from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle by saying: ‘Calm down, dear.’

He later said he was ‘hugely sorry’ for the remark, which was taken from a TV advert.

Mrs Morgan denied that the comment showed the PM was an ‘innate sexist’ and said he has a better record promoting women than the Lib Dems – pointing out there are no Lib Dem women in the Cabinet.

Nicky Morgan said Tristram Hunt made the remark 'in the heat of the moment' during a fiery Commons debate on schools

She added: ‘I have to say the shadow education secretary said to me last week in education questions “Not my responsibility, love”.

‘I’m afraid to say there can be things that are said in the heat of the moment on all sides of the house.’ The heckle is thought to have come as Mrs Morgan confronted Labour over its tuition fees policy.

Higher education fees are strictly a matter for shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, not Mr Hunt. Mrs Morgan also revealed she did not find the Commons chamber during Prime Minister’s Questions intimidating.

She added: ‘Prime Minister’s Questions is a tiny part of the week... The work we do in our constituencies, our surgeries, helping people, making the case for our areas to government, that is something women are absolutely brilliant at doing.

‘The tone of the debate when you get women ... is very different. We need more women in Parliament.’

Labour last night declined to comment.
