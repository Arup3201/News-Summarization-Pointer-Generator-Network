Arsene Wenger and Arsenal fans are clearly delighted with the £10million purchase of Mathieu Debuchy as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who headed to Manchester City once his contract expired.

But the domino effect means Newcastle United can be satisfied with a smooth bit of transfer business themselves that, statistically, looks even shrewder.

Daryl Janmaat arriving on Tyneside for £5m after a fine season with Feyenoord and impressive World Cup with Holland is something the Magpies can crow about.

Based on a comparison using data analysed by Squawka, Janmaat comes out better than Debuchy in a number of areas.

For example, the Dutchman defeats the Frenchman in both total score and defence score for the 2013/14 season. These scores are produced by an advanced algorithm that evaluates the outcome of every recorded on-ball action, such as passing, tackling, and chances created (as detailed by Opta).

Janmaat scores 23.38 points overall, compared to Debuchy’s 14.69 points, while defensive scores are 9.87 to 8.99 in favour of the new Newcastle right-back. Janmaat played 2,644 domestic minutes, while Debuchy appeared a similar 2,491 minutes.

Janmaat completed 38.20 passes per match at 82 per cent success rate, while Debuchy made 25.14 passes with 73 per cent success. Janmaat also had five assists to three.

Debuchy shaded tackles per game (2.45 to 2.20) and was a clear winner in interceptions per game (2.38 to 1.47) but committed more fouls (1.41 to 0.83).

A quite understandable argument could be made that Debuchy was performing in the Premier League for a team who occasionally struggled, while Janmaat was turning out in the weaker Eredivisie for a side who finished second.

And it is true that when their respective World Cup performances are assessed the numbers are closer and in some cases favour Debuchy. Janmaat remains the better attacking presence with a score of 6.58 points to 4.34 points, however.

It remains to be seen how he adopts to the pace and physicality of the Premier League, and Wenger will know the premium paid for Debuchy is because of his English experience.

But for a profit of £5m, Newcastle have a very good player who can rival, and in some cases better, the man he replaces.
