The BBC have told Phil Neville and his Match of the Day colleagues to watch what they say after the ex-Manchester United star made comments seeming to glorify dangerous tackles on players who are showboating.

Neville, 38, sparked controversy when he said he would 'smash' team-mates in training if he saw them perform a 'no look' pass like Tomas Rosicky's during Arsenal's 3-2 FA Cup win over Brighton and Hove Albion.

Viewers of Sunday's Match of the Day 2 heard Neville remark: 'If that was a training session and somebody did that, I'd be first over there and I'd probably look to two-foot him or take him out of the game. If somebody did that in training to me, winding me up, I would be straight in there. I'd smash them.'

Phil Neville made the comments on Match of the Day, but later claimed it was 'tongue in cheek'

After receiving angry responses on Twitter, he went on to say his comments were not to be taken seriously.

Gary Lineker dismissed the furore around Neville's comments, tweeting: 'What bunkum. He was clearly joking. Absolutely no chance that anyone at the BBC will warn him.'

BBC Sport reminded its on-screen team to be more circumspect in their punditry after some viewers complained. 

'This comment was not meant to offend in any way but, on reflection, Phil acknowledges that the language he used was unfortunate,' a spokesman told their website.

'That said, Mark Chapman did immediately challenge him and the tone of the discussion was light-hearted enough to suggest that the panel were not condoning any kind of violence or setting an example to a younger audience. 

'BBC Sport will remind the team to take extra care during discussions.'
