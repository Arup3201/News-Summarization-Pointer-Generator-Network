The United States has thrown its weight behind Iraq's new president Fouad Massoum just hours after the country's embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki accused him of violating the constitution.

Mr al-Maliki accused Kurdish Mr Massoum, who was named president last month, of neglecting to name a prime minister from the country's largest parliamentary faction by Sunday's deadline.

He said Massoum has violated the constitution 'for the sake of political goals.'

But The U.S. state department said it 'fully supports' Mr Massoum and rejects any effort to use coercion or manipulation in the process of choosing a new Iraqi leader.

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. supports the process to select a prime minister 'by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner.'

Al-Maliki's surprise speech late Sunday plunged the government into a political crisis at a time it is battling advances by Islamic State militants.

Special forces loyal to al-Maliki were 
deployed in strategic areas  of Baghdad on Sunday night after he 
delivered a tough speech  indicating he would not cave in to pressure to
 drop a bid for a  third term, police sources said.

 Shi'ite militias stepped up patrols in the  capital, police said. An 
eyewitness said a tank was stationed at  the entrance to Baghdad's Green
 Zone, which houses government  buildings.

Al-Maliki is seeking a third term as prime minister, but the latest crisis has prompted even his closest allies to call for his resignation. A parliament session scheduled for Monday to discuss the election and who might lead the next Iraqi government was postponed until Aug. 19.

The 
Islamic State has capitalized on political deadlock and sectarian 
tensions that have made it easier for the group to make fresh gains 
after arriving in the north in June from Syria.

The
 group, which sees Shi'ites as infidels who deserve to be killed, has 
ruthlessly moved through one town after another, using tanks and heavy 
weapons it seized from soldiers who fled in the thousands.

Islamic 
State militants have killed hundreds of Iraq's minority Yazidis, burying
 some alive and taking women as slaves, an Iraqi government minister 
said on Sunday, as U.S. warplanes again bombed the insurgents.

President
 Barack Obama last week approved limited airstrikes against Islamic 
State fighters, saying the current military campaign would be a 
'long-term project' to protect civilians from the deadly and brutal 
insurgents.

U.S. 
officials said the dispute between al-Maliki and Massoum centers on the 
specifics of the deadline for nominees to replace the prime minister. 
While al-Maliki believes the deadline was Sunday, other Iraqi leaders 
believe the deadline is Monday afternoon.

The officials said the U.S. believes there is flexibility for the deadline to extend into Monday.

The
 U.S. officials said the Obama administration had no confirmation of 
such developments, but said there was an increased security presence in 
Baghdad.

The
 chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
of California, also said the militants pose a threat 'in our backyard' 
and were recruiting Westerners.

'Inaction is no longer an option,' she said in a statement as airstrikes were underway.

The
 rhetoric tracked closely to that used in the lead-up to the 2003 
invasion of Iraq. In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, lawmakers 
from both parties voted to give President George W. Bush the authority 
to take military action against Iraq in the hopes of combating 
terrorism.

At the time, many said the United States faced a choice of fighting terrorism on American soil or on foreign soil.

A
 close White House ally, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said 
Islamic State fighters are a 'growing and troublesome' threat. But he 
added, 'We must not send the troops.'

'The big question is: What can the United States do to stop it?' Durbin asked.

American airstrikes have included attacks by fighter pilots and drones near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq, as recently as Sunday. The strikes are aimed at limiting Islamic State fighters' advances and helping Iraqi forces regain control.

U.S. and Iraqi aircraft also have dropped humanitarian aid for the minority Yazidis, thousands of whom have been stranded on a mountaintop since the Islamic militants seized Sinjar, near the Syrian border, last week. U.S. Central Command reported that the U.S. military conducted a fourth airdrop of food and water Sunday.

The State Department said Sunday it had relocated a limited number of staff members from the U.S. consulate general in Irbil. Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the move was made 'out of an abundance of caution rather than any one specific threat.' Staffing at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad 'remains the same,' she said.

Talks between Washington and al-Maliki that would have allowed U.S. troops to remain in Iraq collapsed in 2008, and Obama withdrew troops in 2011. Al-Maliki now is under mounting pressure to step aside, including requests from U.S. lawmakers.

'The collapse of Mosul was not a result of lack of equipment or lack of personnel. It was a leadership collapse,' said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. 'And so in order to put the situation right, we have to begin at the fundamental core, which is leadership in Baghdad, Iraqi leadership.'
