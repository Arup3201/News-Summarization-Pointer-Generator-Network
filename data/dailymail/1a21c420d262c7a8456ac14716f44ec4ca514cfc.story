David Weir revived memories of his London 2012 heroics by racing to Commonwealth gold at Hampden Park.

The wheelchair racer, who famously claimed four golds at the Olympic Stadium, swept to another title in the T53/54 1500m, bursting clear in the final 300m to cruise home in three minutes 21.67 seconds.

The Weirwolf, as he became known at the Paralympics, produced a blistering turn of speed in the closing stages to win by almost one-and-a-half seconds.

Victory, greeted by huge cheers from the packed crowd, earned the 35-year-old his first Commonwealth title.

He enjoyed a lighter year in 2013 after his Paralympic exploits, missing the IPC World Championships in Lyon, but insisted ahead of these Games he had 'the hunger back' as a result and it showed as he bided his time before launching his attack down the back straight.

Weir, who had to dodge the puddles from the earlier teeming rain, told BBC Sport: 'It's a nice feeling. It was in the back of mind after 2012, 'Should I carry on?' This is why I carried on.

'It feels like London, so many English flags.

'It's been great. I'm a little bit faster. I'd been worried about the weather all week as manufacturer of my gloves doesn't make them any more and they didn't work so well in the rain. I prayed I had a bit of grip for the sprint which I did.

'It's so much more difficult as you need contact on the rims, and you get spray from the wheels. That's why I was going wide as there were puddles. I won anyway.'

There was more medal success for England as 18-year-old Jade Jones took bronze in 4mins 00.19secs.
