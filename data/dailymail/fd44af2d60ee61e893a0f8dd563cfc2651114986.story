Everton have drawn up a list of goalkeeping targets after an injury to Tim Howard.

The American faces at least a month on the sidelines with a calf problem, but is also attracting interest from the MLS.

Joel Robles, 24, continued to deputise between the sticks for Tuesday night's FA Cup draw against West Ham at Goodison Park, but could return to Spain.

Cardiff City keeper David Marshall is also on Everton's radar as Roberto Martinez looks to strengthen

Cardiff's David Marshall and Alex McCarthy of QPR are among the names on Everton's list of potential replacements.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez said: 'There are a couple of options I feel could fit really well but I wouldn't just bring in anyone who stops the development of a youngster. 

'I would rather make it a long-term signing. I don't think short-term would be a solution for us now.' 

Norwich's John Ruddy, Ali Al Habsi of Wigan, Sergio Romero of Sampdoria and Feyenoord's Erwin Mulder have also been mentioned.
