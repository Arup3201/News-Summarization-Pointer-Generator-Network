A £6 million party funded by the EU for 5,000 young people  this weekend caused a headache for the Eurocrats: what if it all  got out of hand?

So, to avoid doubt, the organisers issued an edict – don’t have an orgy without the strict consent  of all those involved.  

The three-day European Youth Event in Strasbourg is being held to teach 16 to 30-year-olds from across the EU about ‘common European values’.

The 16 to 30-year-olds attending a youth event at the EU Parliament in Strasbourg were issued adivce warning them not to have sex with other participants without getting consent from all involved

But with all those hormones flying around, organisers felt obliged to warn participants: ‘Do not engage in any sexual activities without obtaining explicit and informed consent of all persons present.’

Paul Nuttall, Ukip deputy leader, called the advice 'mind-boggling' and branded the whole exercise a 'propaganda event'

The advice, contained in the 171-page event guide, goes on: ‘Be aware that personal boundaries are different and not everyone enjoys the same level of physical contact.

‘Consider this in your interactions and remember that others may misinterpret your actions.  Be aware that some participants are under 18.

'Act in accordance with any applicable laws and avoid situations where positions of trust can be misused.’  

The advice led to ridicule from UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall, who said: ‘It is mind-boggling that they want to give advice about having sex on the premises.’

He added: ‘Brussels bureaucrats have a neck spending millions on a propaganda event to make young people love the EU when youth unemployment is reaching 60 per cent in Greece and Spain. It is a scandalous waste of money.’

A European Parliament spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
