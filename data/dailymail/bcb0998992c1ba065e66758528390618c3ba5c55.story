Atletico Madrid have signed Antoine Griezmann in a £24million move from Real Sociedad.

The 23-year-old French World Cup star finalised his move to the Spanish champions on Tuesday after completing a medical and agreeing terms on a six-year deal.

The Spanish champions announced on their official website and Griezmann will now link up with Atletico on their pre season tour in South America.

Atletico director of football Jose Luis Perez Caminero said: 'Antoine was a priority for us and fortunately we have signed him.

'He is one of the most important players in our league and he showed that at Real Sociedad.

'His arrival is great news for our club.'

And Atletico boss Diego Simeone is excited at the prospect of the Frenchman joining the club.

'He’s a brilliant player,' said Simeone, speaking to reporters on Atletico's US pre season tour. 'He is very quick and can give us a lot of options in attack.'

Tottenham and Chelsea had been linked with the Frenchman, who starred for his nation during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but the La Liga champions have won the race for his signature.

And the Sociedad later issued a statement thanking the pacey wideman for his contribution during his nine years in San Sebastian.

'Real Sociedad would like to thank Antoine Griezmann for the professionalism and dedication shown during his years at the club, while wishing you the best for your personal and professional future.'

Griezmann has been capped nine times for Les Bleus and has netted on three occasions.

The winger will link up with Arda Turan and fellow new signing Mario Manduzkic in an impressive front three as Atleti look to defend their La Liga title from big-spending Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid.
