John Lewis: a temple of calm for its loyal customers. A cup of tea in the cafe can cure most evils of the soul. Christian country or not, we are certainly a John Lewis one.

It is a sign of our affection for the place that this Wednesday it reaches a milestone of 150 years.

Chairman Charlie Mayfield — only the fifth boss in all that time — presides over a £10 billion turnover and 91,000 staff (or partners, as they are known), 31 department stores, the Waitrose chain and a booming website.

This 1890 ladies' walking suit (left), which would cost £130 today, was ill-named because its long skirt made it difficult for women to travel far. Meanwhile, high-end versions of this 1910s parasol (right) cost £1, or £99 today

The first electric iron in the 1920s had a 'hot point' at the tip - giving Hotpoint its name - and weighed 2.5kg

In honour of the anniversary, I was invited into the depths of the archives at Odney, a country estate near Cookham, Berks, designed for the enjoyment of the lucky employees.

It’s so civilised I keep expecting someone to bring me a warm scone or a cushion.

The store was founded in 1864 by John Lewis, an apprentice linen draper from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, whose father died when he was eight.

It started life as a haberdasher’s in Oxford Street and founded its reputation on quality silk that undercut its rivals on price.

The first handheld hairdryers (left), costing £11 in 1925, were so heavy women's arms would usually tire before their hair had dried. Right, this heater was one of John Lewis's Christmas Gift Guide's most coveted gifts in 1926 The size of a desk fan, heat radiated from one bulb. But many homes didn't have the electricity it required.

The Jantzen Sports Swimwear range, launched by John Lewis in 1922, marked the moment when women were first allowed to show their legs in public. Attitudes to women's fashion were at last changing

But it wasn’t always as serene as you might imagine. After a fierce battle over rent with his landlord, Lord Howard de Walden, the man who founded the temple of modern manners spent three weeks in Brixton prison for contempt of court.

It was his handsome eldest son, John Spedan Lewis, who, in 1925, came up with the principle and slogan for which John Lewis is famous ‘Never knowingly undersold’ — meaning customers could be confident they were not paying more than they would at other stores.

Early machines in the 1920s (left), costing £60, mimicked the hand movements of a woman washing clothes on a washboard. Until then, housewives used two tubs of water, weighing up to 50lb each. Right, in 1932,  John Lewis launched its own range of fitted kitchens, displaying one of them in the window of its Oxford Street store

The Fifties saw the trend for labour-saving gadgets take off, with John Lewis starting to stock the Dualit toaster in 1953 - and Dualit's design has barely changed since

He also dreamed up a creative way to annoy a self-made autocratic parent who still retained an orphan’s fear of poverty.

He decided his father had more money than was good for him and that John Lewis profits should be distributed among the staff.

Given that his father had total control over the company until his death in 1928 at the age of 92, he had to wait to put his plans into practice.

The teasmade (left) - a kettle with a tube leading into a teapot, heated by an electric element - became a mass hit when it arrived in John Lewis stores in 1966. Right, the first microwave was built in the US in the Forties and was 6ft high. Within 20 years, the first counter-top ovens had hit John Lewis, costing £3,000 in today's money

Fondue originated in Switzerland as a way of using up stale cheese. By 1974, they were a John Lewis must-buy

He placed shares in an independent trust and awarded bonuses to all, so they could share ‘gain, knowledge and power’.

Spedan
 hoped the partnership system would increase motivation, morale and 
retention rates, ensuring the company would grow successfully — and he 
was right. John Lewis Partnership outstripped all its rivals.

Big sellers of the first home computers were IBM, Sinclair and Alan Sugar's £500 Amstrad

You can trace the British mood of the times through the catalogues in John Lewis’s archives. It’s fascinating to explore the rabbit warren of shelves, where cardboard boxes are stacked high, documenting a lifetime of retail.

In true John Lewis fashion, archivist Judy Faraday says ‘We never make a fuss about royal things’, as she lets me hold a tiny piece of embroidered lace and velvet.

It’s a bonnet that looks as if it could fit a child, but it once belonged to Queen Victoria, who sent it to Caley’s of Windsor (once a John Lewis outpost, now shut) to be copied in the 1890s during the gloom of her interminable mourning for Prince Albert.

Pictures from around this time show the store had a ‘Foreign Fancy’ department devoted to parasols, china, carpets, stuffed birds... anything that took the buyers’ fancy.

There was also the rich, colourful fabric — printed by hand  — commissioned in 1910 by the White Star Line for the state rooms of the Titanic. Sketches in the catalogue of this time advertise corsets to give the extraordinary top-heavy Queen Mary silhouette (they have names such as ‘Millicent’ and ‘Bertha’).

Long-handled parasols, to shield ladies from the sun or unwanted attention, were a sell-out.By the Twenties, the illustrations are of slim and elegant flappers. A shimmering metal brocade evening wrap is 14 guineas — £750 today.

In the 1990s, the age of the £25 sandwich toaster arrived. It was pioneered by Australian firm, Breville

A wooden 
hat stretcher was used in the millinery department to make sure the 
fashionable bell-shaped cloches weren’t too tight. The store also 
boasted a fur department of luxurious pelts.

In 
the home department, there were innovations as the servant class 
diminished: the first hairdryers, electric irons and washing machines.

Coffee has always been a mainstay of John Lewis sales. Jewel in today's crown is the Jura Giga 5 one-touch bean-to-cup machine at £3,750

In 1932, John Lewis launched fitted kitchens — no longer a place for the mere preparation of food, but now seen as the heart of the home.

Come wartime, the tone of the catalogues changes. Tea towels carry war propaganda. In 1939, you could buy ‘a combined handbag and gas mask carrier, with purse and mirror in morocco leather’, which cost almost ten shillings (£30 today) and had a pocket for your identity card.

There are ‘bright new curtains to banish the blackout’ and ‘siren suits’ — feminine boiler suits marketed as the perfect item to slip into before heading to the air raid shelter.

Parcels for the troops from Waitrose (bought by John Lewis in 1937) included lobster, brown Windsor soup, a fruit cake and foie gras.

In the bleak post-war years there was a longing for colour. Pat Albeck’s Daisy Chain floral fabric was a John Lewis bestseller as trays, tea towels, tablecloths, curtains, chair covers, dresses and dog cushions. For the 150th anniversary, her daughter-in-law Emma Bridgewater has reworked the pattern on a teapot.

Perhaps sales of coffee machines best tell the John Lewis story. Electric percolators arrived in the Sixties, with filter machines in the Seventies. Today, the top-end Jura Giga 5 one-touch bean-to-cup coffee machine costs £3,750.

Certainly not cheap, but definitely good quality and sold with charm and good sense. Just like everything else in John Lewis since 1864.
