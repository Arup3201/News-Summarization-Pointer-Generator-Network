Daisy Coleman, the teen cheerleader who was intensely bullied by her small Missouri town after reporting a rape, is in hospital with possible brain damage following an attempt to take her own life Sunday night.

The teen's heartbroken mother revealed the tragic overdose on Facebook just hours after it happened and hit out at two of Daisy's former friends who had written nasty messages to her just days before.

Melinda Coleman also begged cyber 'hacktivist' organization Anonymous, which showed support for her daughter late last year when the story was in the headlines, not to abandon the case after she said they failed to follow up on any of her leads.

'Where is anonymous now?' Dr Coleman wrote on Facebook Monday. 'My daughter has been terrorized to the point she tried to kill herself last night. She may never be ok. Where are you and your super hacking skills and internet help now.......we really need them.'

Daisy was subjected
 to constant cyber-bullying from classmates at her high school - and even parents - in the 
quiet town of Maryville after she reported in January 2012 that she had 
been raped by at least one older football player.

She
 told police the 17-year-old boy, Matthew Barnett, invited her to a 
party where she became so intoxicated she couldn't stand and then had 
sex with her while his friend filmed the incident on an iPhone.

All 
charges against Barnett, now 19, were dropped in connection with the 
alleged rape last January.

Dr Coleman and her daughter did a 
string of media appearances in October to raise awareness of the case 
and the bullying they were suffering but since then it has only 
worsened, Dr Coleman said, driving Daisy to such extreme actions.

'She had been pretty good, when we were doing interviews and she felt like people were supporting her and honestly being in bigger cities where people were more open-minded it was helping her a lot,' she said.

'When we got back here where we had to be quiet, it became really, really hard. For both of us.'

On Friday night, Daisy briefly attended a party with a friend and arrived home to a stream of abuse on her Facebook page from two girls who she previously counted as friends.

'I had let her go to a party with a friend, she was there for an hour
 and a half. Then she came home and saw Facebook. (One girl) decided to 
write something saying "you're a fake and a phoney," "you wanted it" and
 "you're a slut" because she went to the party,' Dr Coleman told 
MailOnline.

Another girl allegedly chimed in, calling Daisy a 'hypocrite' for going to the party.

Dr Coleman then attacked the pair online, sparking a heated back-and-forth argument.

'I was just really angry. I couldn't believe these girls were writing such horrible things to my daughter and defending it,' she said.

Helpless: Daisy Coleman's mother, Melinda Coleman, pictured, said she felt helpless after how her family has been treated

'She has been through so much and she has done so little. All the other kids are out partying and doing all this stuff and she isn't, she's at home with me all the time. The second they see her at a party for five minutes drinking a Redbull it's all over Facebook and they're tearing her to smithereens...

'They just won't leave her alone, Literally, I have a large grocery bag full of the messages that I've printed off Facebook. Full of them. F*** you comments, get out of town, all of it.'

But this time, the victimization got too much.

'She was in her room (Sunday night) then she walked into her brother's room and said she was seeing ghosts and she was freaking out,' Dr Coleman said of the horrific moment she learned her daughter had tried to kill herself. 'She was acting very strangely.'

The mother said she and her sons got 
Daisy to vomit then they rushed her to the hospital where doctors pumped
 her stomach and put her on an IV. It's unclear yet if she'll suffer 
permanent damage from the overdose.

Bullying: '(One girl) decided to write something saying "you're a fake and a phoney," "you wanted it" and "you're a slut" because she went to the party,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline of the recent comments

'She's
 not coherent, she makes no sense, she's like a two year old,' Dr 
Coleman said, breaking into tears again. 'I asked the nurse if she 
thought she would get better and she said there was no way of telling.'

Dr Coleman, who lost her job at a local veterinarian in the midst of the rape controversy and moved her family some 33 miles out of Maryville to ease the onslaught from the community, claims she has also been followed by a private investigator allegedly linked to the Barnett family.

She said the investigator's silver Chevy sedan even ran Daisy off the road the day before Thanksgiving, when she had been driving her mother's car.

'I normally use the Hummer but I was 
at the gym and Daisy's car wouldn't start so she took the Hummer to pick
 up her brother,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline.

'They
 started briding her and they bumping against her bumper and they scared
 her so she turned too soon and rolled the car all the way down the 
hill. She rolled it six times and totaled it.

'They watched it happen and they waited before driving off,' she added.

TV
 slots: Dr Coleman and Daisy, who waived her right to anonymity, had appeared on numerous television interviews in their determination to 
fight for justice

Never be normal: Daisy says she can't be a normal teenager, because she is constantly being criticized and bullied by her peers

Daisy ended up in hospital but luckily escaped with just bruises.

After that, Dr Coleman, who had taken down the car's number plate, contacted Anonymous again because police told her they couldn't look up the vehicle because it wasn't from Missouri.

'If they could find out who this license plate belongs to... At this point I am begging them, if they would just get this information. But they haven't been responding,' she said.

Dr Coleman said the group has done very little since it spoke out about the case last year.

But she made a desperate plea for the organization to use its hacking skills to help the family now, particularly with Daisy in the hospital.

She wants Anonymous to unearth the iPhone video of the alleged rape, which she believes was carried out by four boys, not just one.

'The video is gone - the video of them raping my daughter,' she said. 'I think it was all four boys and they made sure to hide it. They knew they could get the one off the hook but I honestly think it was all four of them.

Outrage:
 The case sparked national soul searching after all charges were 
dropped against Matthew Barnett, left, and Jordan Zech, right, and then 
Daisy and her family were vilified by the community

'If Anonymous really could get that video it's a slam dunk.'

Thirdly, she is begging Anonymous to access emails sent between prosecutor Robert Rice and Sheriff for Maryville Darren White.

'If Anonymous could get that trail and prove it was political it would be another slam dunk.'

The mother said she remained near enough to Maryville to ensure her eldest son could continue his scholarship for baseball and her second son, who is a star wrestler, wouldn't lose his chance to get his own scholarship for the sport.

After a big state meet in February, she plans to uproot and move to Kansas City.

'I need to get (Daisy) out of here and I need to get my youngest son out of here,' she said. 'We can't do this any more, I don't know what to do. I don't want to run but I don't know what else to do but run.'

In the meantime, Daisy is waiting to be transferred to a hospital in Kansas City. Which hospital depends on the family's limited health cover.

'My insurance only covers a certain amount,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline. 'Now the Hummer is destroyed. Quite honestly I don't have the money so I have to find where she can go that she can be covered.'

The entrance of Maryville High School - High school freshman Daisy Coleman was subjected to constant bullying from classmates - and even parents - in Maryville, Missouri, after she reported she had been raped in January 2012

In late October, the family won a small victory when special prosecutor Jean Baker was assigned to re-investigate the case.

However, Dr Coleman is bracing for disappointment as the release of Ms Baker's report nears.

'I appreciate so much what she has done but I do think the people before her were covering for themselves and they were lying and cheating and deleting evidence so I think we will learn something but it will not be enough,' she said.

'Unless Anonymous can find it, that evidence will never be found.'

For now, the distraught mother is just hoping Daisy's condition will improve enough that the family can attempt to start a new life somewhere else.

'I feel pretty helpless,' Dr Coleman told MailOnline. 'I feel pretty much like there's no justice, like people can destroy my children, my family, my life and take away my career and my home and there's nothing I can do about it.'
