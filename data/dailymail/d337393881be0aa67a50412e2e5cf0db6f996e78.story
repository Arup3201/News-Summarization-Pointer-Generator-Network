Two-thirds of Australians failed to keep their New Year's resolution this year, with most breaking their commitments in the first three months.

A survey by financial comparison website finder.com.au found that the most popular resolution for 2015 is to improve health and fitness, followed by money-related goals and resolutions relating to relationships.

The research found that the first three months of the year are critical to success, with 80 percent of people who failed saying they did so in the first three months.

Krystle Keller, 30, from Glebe in Sydney wants to get fitter, more toned and lose weight in 2015

CC Thornley, 40, a banjo player from Victoria, tried to quit smoking in 2014 and plans to quit again in 2015

Of those who failed at their 2014 resolution, 35 percent said their goal was too unrealistic and 33 percent did not track their progress.

Almost a quarter percent said they forgot about their New Year's resolution and one in 10 said they made too many resolutions.

CC Thornley, a professional banjo player from Torquee in Victoria, tried to quit smoking in 2014 but ended up taking it up again after six months.

'I progressively cut back in the middle of the year, and went without, but around the end of this year there were quite a few parties and it just sort of happened, you just think one won't hurt,' Mr Thornley said.

Mr Thornley, 40, is planning to quit again in 2015.

'It's about fitness more than anything else because I surf a fair bit, so my resolution is to keep active and keep surfing more.'

Renee Molony, who works in insurance, set out to buy an investment property in 2014 but ended up buying a house with her father.

'I'm glad we've done it but I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't all on my own,' Ms Molony said.

The 33-year-old, from South Plympton in Adelaide, already owns a unit but wants to start a property portfolio so she can eventually own a large property in the country.

'I saved up during the year and then about October I found somewhere and I couldn't get the loan on my own,' Ms Molony said.

'It was either go halves with dad or not do it at all.'

She cut back on spending drastically and made extra cash by participating in paid surveys and collecting bottles and cans.

In 2015 Ms Molony's resolution is to renovate her unit, and she plans to use the same tactics to achieve her goal.

Krystle Keller, who is doing a PHD in marine biology, can't remember her 2014 resolution but wants to get fitter and lose weight in 2015.

'I want to be able to do racing and triathlons and stuff – I've got a lot of friends who are really fit want me to join them and I want to get to the level where I can do that,' Ms Keller said.

'Women often have bigger thighs and bigger bellies and I just want to get rid of that.'

The 30-year-old, from Glebe in Sydney, said she sharing her New Year's resolution with people to help her stick to her goal.

'I'm telling a lot of my friends and family and trying to get them to encourage me – it helps to stay motivated,' Ms Keller said.

The first three months of the year are critical to success, with 80 percent of people who failed saying they did so in the first three months

Almost three-quarters of the more than 2000 people surveyed did not tell anybody what their New Year's resolution was. Of those who did share their goals and ended up achieving them, 76 percent said talking about it helped.

The majority of people who were successful in achieving their goals took more than six months to achieve it.

Finder spokeswoman Michelle Hutchison said the best way to achieve your goals is to make a clear plan and don't overload yourself.

'Be realistic with what you can achieve and don't set too many goals,' Ms Hutchison said.

'It's OK to set more than one goal but if they are simple and obtainable they will more likely be reached.'

Her other tips include:

Share your goals: 'Let your family and friends know about your resolutions - this can help you be accountable for your goals, help you commit to them and create a support network around you that can help you.'

Keep track: 'Use an online tool or set yourself reminders to ensure you keep track on your progress.'

Make it happen: 'Don't just set some goals then forget about them. If you are planning to save for something like a holiday, you'll need to review your finances, start researching the costs, set yourself a budget and work out how much you will need to save each month to reach it.'

Set small goals throughout the year: 'If you have one big goal you set out to achieve, it probably won't happen all of a sudden by the end of the year. Most goals need small steps to reach the end goal.'

On Monday, Finder launched an online tool which allows people to select their goal for 2015, share it on social media and receive email reminders to help stay on track.
