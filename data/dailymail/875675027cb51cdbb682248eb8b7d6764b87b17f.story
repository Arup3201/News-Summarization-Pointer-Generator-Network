A late goal from substitute Tommy Smith rescued Brentford a point in their opening Sky Bet Championship game against Charlton at Griffin Park, as the Bees made their long-awaited return to the second tier of English football after 21 years away. 

Igor Vetokele's close-range header in the 64th minute looked to have sealed all three points for the away side in a closely fought London derby, but Smith had other ideas when he drove at goal in the closing stages.

The 35-year-old, a free signing for the Bees this summer, cut inside five minutes from the end and whipped a shot towards goal that caught a deflection on its way past goalkeeper Stephen Henderson, to grab the hosts a point.

Brentford could even have won it in the 88th minute, when midfielder Alan Judge went agonisingly close to completing a remarkable comeback with a curling fee-kick that crashed back off the crossbar.

Charlton boss Bob Peeters named four debutants for Saturday's clash at Griffin Park, as former Premier League defenders Andre Bikey and Tal Ben Haim started alongside Chris Solly and Rhoys Wiggins in defence. 

Vetokele and George Tucudean, also recent additions to the Addicks squad, spearheaded their attack.

In the first half Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham, fired wide from 20 yards for the hosts, before Bees keeper Button rescued his side with a fine save to deny George Tucudean from putting Charlton in front.

Johnnie Jackson should have done better but scooped his shot wide from the edge of the box and the first half ended in stalemate.

Vetokele served notice of what was to come early in the second half when he twice went close for the visitors.

First he forced a superb save from Button with a dipping drive and he then saw his header tipped onto the post a minute later.

The Angolan forward did break the deadlock in the 64th minute when he diverted Jackson's corner past Button.

Brentford were guilty of poor finishing with Jonathan Douglas and captain Tony Craig both wasting gilt-edged chances, the latter volleying over from close range when completely unmarked.

Charlton substitute Callum Harriott hit the bar midway through the second period after a mistake from Button. 

But it was the hosts that got on the scoresheet five minutes from time, Smith finding an inch inside the six-yard box to smash home with the help of a deflection off a Charlton defender.

And moments later Brentford midfielder Judge was left cursing the woodwork when it denied his neatly struck free-kick from stealing all three points for the hosts.
