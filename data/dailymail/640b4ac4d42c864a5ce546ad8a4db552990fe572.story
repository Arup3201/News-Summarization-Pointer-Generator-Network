The wife of a passenger on missing the MH370 flight plane has spoken of her heartache, revealing she is still desperate for answers a year after the airliner vanished.

It has been 12 months to the day since Perth father Paul Weeks boarded the Beijing-bound flight in Kuala Lumpur and his wife Danica Weeks is still at a loss about what to tell her young boys - and where their beloved father has gone.

Ms Weeks said despite being advised by people that she needs to tell Lincoln, 4, and Jack, 2, what happened to him, she refuses to lie to their sons and will wait until the truth is discovered.

'People say you've got to tell them the truth and I say "do you?" because I don't and I'm not going to put them through what I think it is then it turns out to be something completely different – and I will choose to tell them,' she told The Sydney Morning Herald.

Ms Weeks described the past year as 'surreal' and a 'blur' without being able to see, or even say farewell, to her 'best friend'. 

'I'm just this housewife wanting her amazing husband. He did so much for us as a family and he would do exactly the same if he was in my shoes – he would want to bring us home – and I'll do it for him, he deserves it,' she said. 

Her mining engineer husband, who was on his way to start a new job in Mongolia when the plane inexplicably vanished, gave her his wedding ring when they said their goodbyes at the airport on Marhc 8, 2014.

Ms Weeks said she could not have survived the trauma of the past 12 months if it wasn't for the support of the Western Australian community. 

She added that it has been impossible to begin the mourning process and even think about moving on. 

'Even for the children, we haven't even had a memorial or had a chance to say our goodbyes,' she said.

'[Since MH370] There have been two plane crashes and they get the bodies home – we don't even get a piece of the plane.'

This comes as China's Foreign minister vowed to never give up looking for the plane while Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the search can't go on forever.

Other officials said discussions were already under way between countries involved in the search as to whether to call off the hunt in coming weeks.

As his country said prayers on Sunday for those who were on board the missing flight, Malaysia's Prime Minister said no words could describe their pain.

'The lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear,' said Mr Najib Razak.

'No words can describe the pain the families of those on board are going through.'

China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said in Beijing that the search for the Malaysia Airlines flight which vanished one year ago today will not stop.

'The search for MH370 will continue,' said Mr Wang, echoing the previously-spoken commitment of the countries involved in the hunt for the aircraft - Australia, Malaysia and China - in the southern Indian Ocean.

While China and Malaysia vow to search for as long as it takes to find the aircraft

In Kuala Lumpur, Mr Najib spoke of the joint effort, adding in his official statement that 'together with our international partners, we have followed the little evidence that exists.

'Malaysia remains committed to the search and hopeful that MH370 will be found.'

Although Mr Abbott said he was confident the aircraft would be found as 40 per cent of 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australian had been scrutinised and another 60,000sq km to be covered if necessary, he added that the search had to end at some stage.

'It is one of the great mysteries of the 21st century and I know that there will be a nagging doubt in the minds of billions of people until such time as we can find that plane,' he told reporters in Sydney on Sunday.

'It can't go on forever but, as long as there are reasonable leads, the search will go on.'
