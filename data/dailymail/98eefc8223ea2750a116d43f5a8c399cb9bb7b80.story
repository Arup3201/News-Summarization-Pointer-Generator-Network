The real estate developer accused of murdering his wife was having an affair with another woman, prosecutors said in court today, on the same day the medical examiner testified that strangulation by another person was the cause of death.

The murder trial of Adam Kaufman, from Miami, resumed today with prosecutors introducing a motive for the murder of his wife Lina Kaufman, who he is accused of strangling to death.

Kaufman claims his wife had a heart defect and that he woke up on November 7, 2007, and found her unconscious in the bathroom, with her neck draped over a magazine holder.

He earlier blamed her death on an extreme allergic reaction to a spray tan she had done the day before for the first time.

But Chief Medical examiner Dr Bruce Hyma returned to the stand today and testified that he was convinced 'to a medical certainty' that Lina Kaufman died from 'mechanical asphyxiation' applied by 'another person or persons'.

He said the deep strangulation bruising on Lina Kaufman’s neck could not have been caused by the flimsy magazine holder.

Earlier in the day, state Attorney Bill Baldwin told Judge Browyne Miller of Kaufman's alleged affair and his behavior soon after his wife's death: 'Here, he's asking this girl out with his dead wife's wedding ring on his finger, a month later.

'By January, February, they're having regular sex. He was not exactly devastated by his wife's passing. I mean, the best analogy I can think of is when Casey Anthony getting a tattoo.'

The defense balked at the prosecution's allegations, according to Local 10.com.

'This takes the cake,' said attorney William Matthewman. 'What is the possible relevance of this testimony? There is none.

'There is absolutely no evidence of any impropriety during this marriage, any marital infidelity during this marriage, on either side.

'Adam is still wearing his wedding ring. He has to be forced to go out.'

The prosecution then admitted they had no evidence that Kaufman was unfaithful to his wife prior to her death.

Two of Lina Kaufman's closest friends also told the court that she was a specimen of good health and never complained of shortness of breath or chest pains.

In the afternoon, Dr John Stollar, the emergency room physician who treated Lina when she got to hospital, told the court when asked what his preliminary diagnosis of how she died was.

'Perhaps she had a broken neck, perhaps she was strangled, perhaps she was hung,' he said.

Last week, the Florida court listened to the dramatic 911 call made by Kaufman on the night of November 7.

'Oh my god - I don't know what is going on,' he is heard saying. 'I don't know what happened. She's on the floor dying. She's not breathing.'

The prosecution allege that the call occurred moments after Kaufman strangled his wife to death at their Aventura, Florida, home.

Wiping tears away from his eyes as he sat in court, Kaufman watched as the prosecution showed the jury pictures of his wife's body covered in cuts and abrasions, which they said were not there hours before her death.

The prosecution acknowledged that it took state medical examiners 18 months to issue a finding that Lina Kaufman's death was murder, but Mansfield said that was due to all possible alternatives being considered.

The defense team for Kaufman told the jury that Lina Kaufman was cursed with fainting episodes and also had significant scarring on her heart, which could have been the cause of her collapse.

They also concluded that the injuries to the mother-of-two's neck were the result of falling and hitting the magazine rack in the bathroom.

'This case is a tragedy of errors. An innocent man was charged with a non-existent crime, this is a prosecution in search of a crime,' said Matthewman.

The prosecution is expected to wrap up its case tomorrow.

The death of Lina Kaufman came to national prominence when her husband was charged with her murder in 2009, 18 months after her death and only when Kaufman complained to the medical examiner's office about the amount of time spent on the investigation.

Appearing in court in 2009, the property developer's defense initially hinged around a spray tan the day before her death, Lina's first ever, which was claimed caused her to have a massive allergic reaction according to NBC Miami

However, the prosecution have been dismissive of this claim and that of Lina suffering from a bad heart.

'Under the laws of science, it's impossible to have happened either way the defendant suggested it happened,' said Mansfield.

Opening the case by playing the distressing 911 call, Kaufman was heard hysterically screaming that his wife is not breathing.

The prosecution alleged that the information Kaufman gave on the call was that of a calculating man beginning to cover his tracks.

'Lina had a bad heart,' countered defence attorney Bill Matthewman.

'You will hear no motive. No evidence of a motive whatsoever.

'No life insurance. No financial crimes. No affairs during the marriage on behalf of Adam or Lina.

'No neighbours heard any arguments.'

Under house arrest with his two children since 2009, Kaufman is supported by his wife's family and her mother will testify to the court that her daughter 'suffered from seizures, from fainting, from headaches.'

It was on November 6, 2007, that Eleonora 'Lina' Kaufman received her first even spray tan, went to see a girlfriend who looked at the work and noted at the time there were no bruises on her body.

Then at 6am on November 7, a frantic sounding Kaufman phoned 911 to report his wife's death, in a phone call which lasted more than 15 minutes.

'Oh God! Oh God! Lina,' cried Kaufman as he was instructed to give his wife CPR.

During the trial, the jury heard from Dr Tracy Baker, a plastic surgeon who had performed breast-implant surgery on Lina Kaufman.

He told told the court that he knew Lina to be fit and to work out two to three times a week and that during his examination of her never found any heart symptoms.

The court also heard from Larissa Adamyan, Lina's best friend who said that she had seen her friend have at least one fainting spell.

'She was dizzy, she called me. She was dizzy and on the floor,” said Adamyan according to CBS Miami

The police first became suspicious of Kaufman after one officer noted that his Mercedes-Benz was warm on the hood and was making clicking sounds as though it had just been driven when they arrived at his house on the night his wife died.

In addition, two firefighters who arrived at the scene told the court that it was suspicious to them that Kaufman was dressed and that only one side of the pair's bed appeared to have been slept in.

The defense dismissed this as pure speculation and even went as far as to say that the emergency workers could have mistaken Kaufman's identical twin Seth, who lived down the street and had come to the house that night, for his brother.

Lt Michael Castro reported that Kaufman told emergency workers that he found his wife slumped over a toilet like she had been vomiting.

The firefighter said that Kaufman changed his story at Aventura Hospital and said that he found his wife's neck resting on the magazine rack.

He also added that he was wary of Kaufman's 'odd' behaviour that shifted from calm to angry.

'It was almost like an act,' said Castro.

The defense have hired Dr Michael Bodden, the former medical examiner for New York City to debunk the prosecutions claims.

'The investigation underlying this case was biased, incompetent, flawed and inept,' said Matthewman.

Currently free on bail of $500,000, Kaufam could be sentenced to life imprisonment if he is convicted.
