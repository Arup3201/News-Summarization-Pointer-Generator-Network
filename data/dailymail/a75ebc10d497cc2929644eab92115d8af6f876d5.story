A vigilante couple who attacked a man with a cricket bat because they mistakenly thought he was a paedophile were jailed for a total of 11 years today.

Saskia Francis, 33, and Thomas Lee, 26, attacked the unnamed 23-year-old after hearing rumours about his past - breaking down two doors and storming his home in King's Hedges, Cambridge.

Francis hit him with a cricket bat while Lee threatened the man’s 25-year-old girlfriend with a knife.

Francis and Lee then set about wrecking the flat on the night of August 17 last year before stealing a mobile phone and running away. Their male victim needed hospital treatment for a head injury.

Lee admitted aggravated burglary at a court hearing in November. Francis - who has 200 previous convictions - denied the charge but was convicted after a trial at Cambridge Crown Court in January.

Francis, of Cambridge, was jailed for five-and-a-half years on Friday. Lee, also of Cambridge - who has ten previous convictions - was handed the same sentence in February.

The court heard most of Francis’s previous 200 convictions were for shoplifting and also for assaulting a police constable in 2011 and resisting arrest in 2010.

Lee has convictions for offences including battery in 2009, possession with intent to supply class A drugs in 2009 and battery in 2010.

'The violence they used was excessive and completely disproportionate'

PC Fergus Cowley

Also on his record is a conviction for shoplifting and handling stolen goods in 2011, and several others for failing to surrender to custody.

PC Fergus Cowley of Cambridgeshire Constabulary, who investigated the attack, said: ‘Francis and Lee forced their way into the victims' flat, both using knifes, and then assaulted and threatened the victims.

‘It had been prompted by a domestic dispute and an alleged incident for which there was no evidence, but the violence they used was excessive and completely disproportionate.’
