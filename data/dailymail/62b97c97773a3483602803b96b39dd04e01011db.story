Three hoarders who have amassed a jaw-dropping mountain of rubbish at their Bondi home over the past 20 years are now camping on a footpath alongside their festering heap to prevent rubbish collectors from taking it from them.

Cyprus-born Mary Bobolas and her daughters Elena and Liana live in squalor amid piles of filthy boxes, food scraps, clothes and junk in what has become an infamous eyesore in one of Australia's most idyllic suburbs.

Last month, their local council finally won the right to force the Bobolas to dismantle the pile. But the trio are putting up an almighty fight and were spotted this afternoon alongside their garbage suburbs away from home.

Firetrap: The Bobolas' home in Bondi, Sydney has become a festering mountain of garbage

Furious neighbours described the three hoarders, whose home has turned into a disgusting animal-infested mound of garbage, as 'lepers' as their stubborn stand against council moved beyond 12 hours.

'It's horrible, terrible, very unhealthy,' said one local.

The trio's house - which bulges with mounds of rubbish - has become the scene of an ugly legal stoush and has featured regularly in television, magazine and newspaper reports around the country.

A 'delicate' cleanup began yesterday but the defiant hoarders were snapped by MailOnline this afternoon side-by-side with their jaw-dropping pile of garbage more than 10km from Bondi.

Their neighbours issued a resounding 'stay put!'.

Decades of hoarding and bizarre behaviour have turned their single-storey dwelling into a repulsive firetrap and one at the centre of constant attention from local and state governments.

Overflowing: The extent of the Bobolas' hoarding can be seen from space

Last month, in a breakthrough of sorts, the NSW Court of Appeal approved Waverly Council's decision to force the Bobolas to dismantle their mountainous insect-infested pile of garbage.

Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported a 'good Samaritan' hired a Thrifty rental van for the family in a bid to help them shift the tonnes of rubbish, a move that has been slammed by neighbours.

'Who on earth would do that, Thrifty will never mean the same to me again,' said one longtime local.

The offer backfired when the Bobolas began camping in the van and refused to hand back the keys.

'This is a very delicate situation, you couldn't dream it up,' the 62-year-old resident told MailOnline.

'We were told we were getting poor neighbours but what has happened is unbelievable...I've learned to live with it, they didn't ask to be born.'

Nauseating: Locals describe the stench as 'sickening'

Stay put! Neighbours welcome the Bobolas' absence as they camp alongside their festering heap

A Thrifty staffer had to reposses the vehicle with a spare set of keys and arrived on Monday night to find the van crammed full of the Bobolas' filthy possessions.

They were photographed early on Thursday morning camped in front of the Thrifty depot in Alexandria - where the junk was dumped - alongside their familiar piles of decaying cardboard, clothes bags and electrical wiring.

Curious neighbour Tina Sarafopoulos, who spotted them in-front of the depot, said the hoarders were not in a chatty mood.

'I stopped with my friend and I asked "how are you?" but she didn't say anything. I said "could I buy some of your things?" and she didn't answer.

'Eventually she said "my friend's not here, I can't sell without her". She wouldn't open the boxes.'

Ms Sarafopoulos can see the Bobolas house from her verandah said the ugly mound is a scene of much inexplicable behaviour.

'At 4 o'clock in the morning they push things into the roof,' she told MailOnline.

'The smell is sickening, they're like lepers.'

Another neighbour said the Bobolas weren't around during daylight on Tuesday or Wednesday, describing their absence as 'heavenly peace'.

It is understood the Bobolas have been spending their days in front of the Thrifty property - roughly 12km from their Bondi abode - after police ordered them to remove their trash from the rental yard and stack it on a nearby footpath.

The Bobolas can often be seen wandering the Bondi streets in the early morning hours looking for further items to add to their unenviable treasure trove.
