In a major blow to civil rights activists, the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down an important part of a 48-year-old federal law designed to protect minority voters.

The court ruled on a 5-4 vote in favor of officials from Shelby County, Alabama, in finding that a section of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act that sets the formula that determines which states need federal approval to change voting laws is invalid.

The court, split on ideological lines, did not go as far as striking down Section 5 of the law, which required certain states, mainly in the South, to show that any proposed election-law change does not discriminate against black, Latino or other minority voters.

But a majority did invalidate Section 4 of the act, which sets the formula for states covered by Section 5 and was based on historic patterns of discrimination against minority voters.

Although Section 5 is technically left intact, it is effectively nullified, at least for the near future, as Congress would now need to pass new legislation setting a new formula before it can be applied again.

As a result, the ruling is a heavy blow for civil rights advocates, who believe the loss of a working preclearance program could lead to an increase in attempts to deter minorities from voting.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by her three liberal colleagues, dissented from Tuesday's ruling.

Ginsburg said no one doubts that voting discrimination still exists 'but the court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination,' she said in a dissent that she read aloud in the packed courtroom.

The ruling on the Voting Rights Act is one of the most closely-watched Supreme Court disputes in the past year.

The case centers on the civil rights-era law that broadly prohibited poll taxes, literacy tests and other measures that prevented blacks from voting.

In the 1960s, such laws existed throughout the country but were more prevalent in the South with its legacy of slavery.

The issue of voting rights remains prominent in the United States as judges nationwide heard challenges to new voter identification laws and redrawn voting districts during the 2012 presidential election.

The Obama administration, backed by civil rights advocates, had argued that the provision was still needed to deter voter discrimination.

His issued a statement condemning the decision shortly after it was handed down.

'I am deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision today,' President Obama said in the release.

'Today’s decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent.

'As a nation, we’ve made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting discrimination still exists.' 

Just last week, the Supreme Court struck down an Arizona state law that required people registering to vote in federal elections to show proof of citizenship, a victory for activists who said it discouraged Native Americans and Latinos from voting.

Democrats say that and similar measures, championed by Republicans at the state level, were intended to make it more difficult for certain voters who tend to vote Democratic to cast ballots.
