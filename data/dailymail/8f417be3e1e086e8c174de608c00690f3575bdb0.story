An unlicenced helicopter pilot who frequently flew Hollywood star Russell Crowe from Sydney to his outback Australian home is on the run after being accused of conning a chopper company out of $450,000.

Paul James Bennett, who has a number of aliases, and his partner Simone Anne Wright, are being hunted by police in New Zealand - and the rest of the world - after they vanished from their last known address in Christchurch.

A reported fantasist who once told a court in Britain in the early 1990s that he had been kidnapped while working as a helicopter pilot for the CIA in South Africa, Bennett's work with Russell Crowe was all too real for the Oscar-winning actor.

Crowe has told police that he hired Bennett - who is now about 50 - after the New Zealander landed a helicopter unannounced on his farm in northern New South Wales in 2000 and asked for a job.

The actor was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence, but agreed that the New Zealander could fly him to and from Sydney.

With a number of alleged crimes behind him, Bennett is now being hunted by police following claims he has ripped off a Christchurch helicopter company, whose owner, The Dominion newspaper reported today, was offering $NZ10,000 ($A9,103) for information leading to the arrest of Bennett and his 40-year-old partner.

The owner, who has not been identified, told the paper that Bennett had been contracted by the company to find several helicopters and other parts overseas.

During that time, said the owner, Bennett used the alias David Kite, backing up the name with documents which included a driver's licence.

He is then said to have fabricated and inflated invoices for parts he had supposedly bought and was reimbursed by the company. The money was then transferred into a bank account in New Zealand.

'He is besotted with Ms Wright and committed crimes to maintain the lifestyle she demands,' the company owner said.

Police in Sydney had fraud charges listed against Bennett in 2003 as a result of his work as a pilot for Russell Crowe but he disappeared and the case never came to court.

Three years earlier, he touched down on Crowe's 240-hectare property at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, and impressed the actor with his 'cheek' so much that he was hired to fly Crowe around.

But Bennett was eventually dismissed after he turned a Christmas party organised by Crowe into a media circus after leaking a rumour that the actor planned to wed movie star Meg Ryan.

He also used a photograph of him and Crowe in a chopper cabin to obtain loans from companies. He was later charged with blackmailing a woman he met through a dating service, forcing her to provide cash for his bail on fraud charges.

It is understood that so far he has avoided facing a court - and jail should he have been convicted - but police are now on the trail of both him and Miss Wright, who is in her early 40s.

'The pair use multiple aliases and we do not know what identities they are currently travelling under or where they are,' said New Zealand detective sergeant Craig Farrant.

'We urge them to come forward and contact us so that we can talk to them.'

Bennett's known aliases are: Paul James Williams, David Kite, Dennis Kite, Paul Lochead, David Hanson.

Simone Wright's known aliases are: Sarah Kite, Sarah Shaw, Simone Thalia Williams, Simone Thalia Wright.
