This is the dramatic moment a pharmacist used his own gun to ward off masked raiders who burst into his store during a late night robbery.

Jeremy Hoven was fired from his pharmacy job at Walgreens in Benton Township, Michigan, despite being hailed a hero for using his firearm to defend the store.

Now chilling footage has emerged of the armed masked robbers bursting into the store and holding a manager at gunpoint during the raid at 4.30am on May 8.

Terrifying: Thieves had seconds earlier burst into the store and help up a manager at gunpoint

Spotted: Mr Hoven shot towards the robbers after deciding to 'do what I had to do'

The shocking video shows one of the men leap over the counter after leading the employee with a gun pointed at his back.

But as the robbers attempt to make off with items from the store, quick-thinking Mr Hoven draws his own weapon and fires several downward shots in their direction.

The two men are immediately rattled and hastily scramble away out of the store, their robbery foiled.

Mr Hoven was hailed a hero by locals and gun rights activists, but was nonetheless sacked from his job by Walgreens bosses.

The three other employees at the store at the time have praised Mr Hoven for his bravery and quick thinking. No customers were apparently in the building.

The pharmacist told the Herald-Palladium at the time: 'In my mind, I can look at myself in the mirror. I can lay my head down in bed and sleep. In my mind, I did what I had to do.'

The 36-year-old is now pursuing legal action for wrongful dismissal.

Mr Hoven also told the Herald-Palladium he had tried to call 911 during the raid, 'but couldn't get it done'.

'Within seconds he was over the counter. And I'm looking at the wrong end of a 9-millimeter (gun). He was holding it gangster-style (sideways)', Mr Hoven said.

He said he started firing to 'create a safe zone for myself'.

'I was reacting out of fear, and the adrenaline was taking over... You could have probably taken my pulse from my breath because my heart was beating that much', he said.

Mr Hoven has worked as a night shift pharmacist at the store since 2007, when it opened.

He told the paper he decided to get a concealed weapon permit after the store was robbed in 2007, but had felt management hadn't done enough to address security.

The company contests Hoven's claims that it neglected safety after the 2007 robbery.

'We've made significant investments in security technology in recent years, including increasing the number of digital surveillance cameras at our stores,' the company said.

'We continue to invest in state-of-the-art security measures and high-definition surveillance equipment and hope that the apprehension of robbery suspects in the Benton Harbor area will prevent future crimes.'
