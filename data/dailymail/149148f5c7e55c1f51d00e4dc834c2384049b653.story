Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata has revealed he is on the verge of a move to Juventus.

The forward is set to undergo a medical with the Serie A champions by the end of the week before signing a four-year contract, with the move believed to be worth around 22million euros (£17.5m).

Morata, behind Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Jese in the pecking order in Madrid's attack, was the subject of interest from Arsenal and Wolfsburg but revealed that Juventus have won the battle for his signature.

'I can't wait to get to Turin, everyone has told me it's a great city and I am looking forward to getting to know it,' Morata told Marca.

Once the deal goes through, the 21-year-old will join up with compatriot Fernando Llorente, who joined Juventus from Athletic Bilbao last summer and went on to score 16 goals in the league.

'I haven't had the chance to speak to Fernando, but it's always good to have someone you know in the dressing room when you get to a new club,' said Morata.

As with Dani Carvajal, who Madrid sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 before repurchasing him a year later, a buy-back clause has been inserted into the contract, giving the Spaniards the option to take the forward back to Madrid at the end of next season for 30million euros (£23.8m).

Morata, the top scorer at the European Under-21 Championship in 2013, first broke into the Madrid first team in Jose Mourinho's final year in charge but failed to cement his place in the team under Carlo Ancelotti, playing a total of just 558 minutes in the league last season.
