Louis Van Gaal has hit out at FIFA again on Wednesday night following Holland’s defeat to Argentina - this time over the point of the play-off.

The 62-year-old said: 'This match should never be played. I’ve been saying that for 10 years - it’s unfair.'

The former Bayern Munich and Ajax coach has changed his tune slightly since then, though. Van Gaal does not count Holland’s exit to Argentina as a loss as the scores were level after 120 minutes.

He therefore sees the match in Brasilia as a chance to do something Holland has never done before - end a World Cup without defeat.

'There is still something for us to do here - we can still write history,' Van Gaal said.

'Holland has always lost a match in a World Cup. That happened in ‘74 and ‘78 (when they made the final).

'I hope I can prepare them to play a good match.

'It will be my last match and the players may want to give me a present in the form of a victory so we can leave undefeated.

'It’s quite something to go seven matches unbeaten.'

Van
 Gaal admits it may be hard to raise spirits for the game because of the
 agonising nature of Wednesday’s penalty shoot-out defeat.

'(The defeat) was very, very sad,' he said.

'A dream has been broken and this dream is not going to come back.

'It was all about being number one so to lose this way is the most terrible way.

'I would have rather lost 7-1 (as Brazil did against Germany).'

'It will be my last match and the players may want to give me a present in the form of a victory so we can leave undefeated.

'It’s quite something to go seven matches unbeaten.'
