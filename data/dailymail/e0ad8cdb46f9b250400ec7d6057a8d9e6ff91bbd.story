It is a quiz traditionally associated with the finest minds in the country.

But media watchdog Ofcom has ruled that Channel 4 was right to brand one Mastermind contestant 'astoundingly thick'.

Simon Curtis recorded one of the show’s lowest scores in the history of the programme, but took umbrage when comedian David Walliams mocked him on a comedy show.

Struggle: Simon Curtis' appearance on one episode of Mastermind did not go to plan, leading to one of the lowest scores ever and mocking from comedian David Walliams on his show

Curtis was nicknamed 'Disastermind' in his home town of Castleford, West Yorkshire, after his appearance on the BBC1 show in 2006.

He scored just one point on his chosen subject - the Hollywood actor Jim Carrey.

The 47-year-old claimed he was treated unfairly in an episode of David Walliams’ Awfully Good.

Running commentary: Walliams used his show Awfully Good to mock Curtis, claiming that he was 'astoundingly thick' as he spoke over his attempts to answer the questions

The programme, which was shown on Channel 4 in January, included a clip of Mr Curtis on Mastermind which was introduced by Walliams who said: ‘Sometimes in life, you have to know your limitations... if you’re not, let’s say, very bright, it’s probably not a good idea to go on a quiz show that tests your mental agility.

‘And by not very bright I mean, astoundingly thick.’

Walliams then gave a running commentary as Mr Curtis passed on the first questions.

The probation worker complained to Ofcom that he was portrayed as being of ‘low intelligence’ and that he had not given his consent for it to be shown.

He was also unhappy the show did not mention the clip was from the semi-final of the famous quiz show - which means he had won a previous round.

Mr Curtis, who is a self-confessed quiz addict, had already won £250,000 on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?

In its defence, Channel 4 said that it was obvious Mr Curtis was not literally ‘astoundingly thick’ as he was on Mastermind in the first place.

But it added: 'This was the worst specialist subject performance ever seen on Mastermind.’

Ofcom agreed and refused to uphold any of Mr Curtis’s complaints. It ruled: ‘We recognise that these comments carried the potential to be offensive and insulting to Mr Curtis.

‘However we took the view that it would 
have been clear to viewers from the beginning of the programme that Mr 
Walliams - himself best known as a comedian - intended to provide 
humourous and light hearted opinion and comment on examples of past 
television clips.’

Quiz addict: Curtis took umbrage at Walliams because he failed to mention it was a semi-final, meaning he had previously won an episode of the show

Viewers were left stunned by Curtis’ performance on the first round of Mastermind – in which he passed eleven times and got three answers wrong, before securing just one point.

He had more success in the general knowledge round and had a final score of eight. 

Quizmaster John Humphrys said: ‘I think his mind just went blank. You get people who are immensely knowledgeable and then it won’t come. You feel a bit sorry for them.'

But Mr Curtis is not the worst performer on Mastermind.

Last year Kajen Thuraaisingham, a software analyst, posted the worst total in the show’s 37-year history - a paltry five points.

His first round score of four out of 14 on his specialist subject - The Life of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk [founder of modern Turkey] - was followed by just one out of 15 in the general knowledge round.

The 28-year-old from London scored two fewer than the previous worst total, passing 11 times and giving 13 wrong answers.
