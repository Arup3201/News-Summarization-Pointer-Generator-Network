The suspected gunman 
arrested for shooting a newspaper photographer in Paris had lived in Britain for several years before returning to France in July, the Paris prosecutor says.

Abdelhakim Dekhar, also suspected of three other attacks, had written a 'confused' letter criticising media manipulation and capitalism and including a vague reference to Syria.

Dekhar is in custody in a suburban Paris hospital after police detained him on Wednesday night, ending a two-day nationwide manhunt following an attack at the left-wing newspaper Liberation and a subsequent 
shooting outside the offices of bank Societe Generale.

Police later found him in a 
'semi-conscious state' after an attempt to kill himself with medication,
Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters.

The
witness who led police to him said Dekhar had been staying with her and
that they had met while working in a restaurant together in London 13 
years ago.

The new British link comes just a day after police revealed Dekhar had previously been 
jailed for his role in a Bonnie-and-Clyde-style multiple murder that 
gripped France two decades ago.

Speaking on Wednesday police said his DNA matched samples from the scene of the attacks.

Dekhar
was convicted in 1998 of buying a gun used in the so-called Rey-Maupin 
affair which saw three policemen, a taxi driver killed along with 
shooter Audry Maupin in in October 1994.

In
a press conference late on Wednesday, Interior minister Manuel Valls praised 
police for their handling of Dekhar's arrest, saying that 'all the 
evidence today points to his involvement in the events that he has been 
charged with'.

He was 
arrested around 7pm (6pm GMT) in a vehicle in an underground parking lot
in the northwestern Paris suburb of Bois-Colombes, after apparently 
trying to commit suicide.

Valls
said that 'everything appears to point to a suicide attempt' and 
sources told the AFP news agency that Dekhar was semi-conscious when he 
was found.

Today the prosecutor confirmed Dekhar was being detained on suspicion of attempted murder and kidnapping in four offences including the shooting of an assistant photographer at leading daily newspaper Liberation on Monday.

He is also being investigated about an incidents last week at the BFM-TV network in which he threatened staff with a shotgun, fired shots at the headquarters of French bank Societe Generale and briefly took a driver hostage at gunpoint and forced him to drive from a western suburb to central Paris.

The head of the 
Paris criminal police department Christian Flaesch said that although he was now in 
custody, he was in a 'medical environment' and was not in a fit state to speak 
to investigators.

Search: This CCTV image shows the alleged shooter sitting on a bench of a tramway station in Paris

Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV on Friday

Meanwhile the motive for the 
shootings remains unclear. Valls said investigators would need more 
information about the suspect's past to be able to 'understand his 
motivation'.

The arrest came
after a witness statement to police, who had on Tuesday released a new 
photograph of the man suspected in the attacks and received hundreds of 
calls from potential witnesses.

After Dekhar's arrest, investigators found two letters he had left behind. One appeared to be a suicide note, and the other was described as a 'rather confused' letter evoking 'fascist plots.'

In that second letter, the suspect accuses the media of 'participating in the manipulation of the masses, journalists are paid to make the citizens swallow lies with a little spoon.'

He also criticises capitalism and government neglect of suburban housing projects, which he calls 'an enterprise of dehumanization of a population that the capital doesn't want.'

Such projects, home to many disillusioned and jobless families with roots in former French colonies in Africa, erupted in riots in 2005, and tensions between project youth and police continue to erupt in sporadic violence.

Mr Molins said psychiatrists who examined Dekhar in the 1990s described him as having 'storytelling tendencies' though 'no specific anomaly in the psychiatric sense.' He is to undergo psychiatric examination as well as police questioning.

The shooting prompted cries of concern about attacks on the media. Security was tightened at media offices and on the busy Champs-Elysees.

Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception

Chilling: The gunman aims his pump-action shotgun at the man behind the desk and opens fire

Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun

Escape: The suspect, who is described as white, in his 40s, shaven-headed, fled scene and is now being hunted by police

The
man opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun at the offices of Liberation 
early on Monday, shooting a 23-year-old photographer's assistant as he 
hauled gear in the lobby, then firing another blast that hit the roof 
before leaving within seconds.

He
then crossed the city to the La Defense business district on its 
western edge, where he fired several shots outside the main office of 
the Societe Generale bank, hitting no one.

He
hijacked a car and forced the driver to drop him off close to the 
Champs Elysees in the centre of the French capital, before disappearing.

Police
say he was the same man who on Friday stormed into the Paris 
headquarters of a 24-hour TV news channel, BFMTV, briefly threatening 
staff with a gun before hurrying out.

Dekhar was suspected of being the third man in 
the so-called Rey-Maupin affair, which caused a scandal in France, with 
investigators comparing the Rey and her lover Audry Maupin to the infamous American 
outlaws Bonnie and Clyde.

Witnesses
at the trial in 1998 described him as a mentor to the couple and 
accused him of exploiting their youth to manipulate them.

In
the early 1990s he was known to hang out at squats that were used by 
left-wing radicals and were often under police surveillance.

Maupin
died of injuries sustained during a shoot-out with police and Rey, a 
middle-class student hitherto unknown to the police, was tried and 
sentenced to 20 years in jail. She was released in 2009.

Dekhar
was acquitted of armed assault but found guilty of procuring the weapon
and sentenced to four years. He was released soon after, having already
served his time in pre-trial detention.

Valls
said that Dekhar had 'probably gone abroad' for several years after 
serving his sentence and did not appear in official records for that 
period.

This week's attacks set off a major manhunt and raised concerns about violence against media outlets.

The
photographer, who suffered wounds to the chest and stomach, was rushed 
to surgery and appeared to be in better condition on Wednesday.

Hospital officials said he had regained consciousness and was no longer in need of an artificial respirator.
