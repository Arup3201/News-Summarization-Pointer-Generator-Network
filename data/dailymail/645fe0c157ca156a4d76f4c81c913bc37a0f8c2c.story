World financial markets went into freefall today with Wall Street on track for its worst weekly losses in three years - despite pledges from leading economies to stabilise the crisis.

Just after Wall Street opened today, the Dow Jones was down 36, or 0.3 per cent, at 10,698; the S&P was down 3 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 1,127; and the Nasdaq was down 2, or 0.1 per cent, at 2,454.

In Europe, London's FTSE 100 plunged below the important 5,000 mark by lunchtime as it dropped by 1.3 per cent to 4,977, while France's CAC-40 and Germany's DAX were both down 0.9 per cent.

Dramatic day: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday as stocks tumbled for a fourth straight session, following the Federal Reserve's weak outlook for the U.S. economy on Wednesday

Asian shares continued to fall sharply, 
with South Korea's Kospi index posting a whopping 5.7 per cent decline 
as banking chaos and probes into illegal dealing gripped the country.

The FTSE finally scraped back up and closed on 5,066.81, up by 25.20 points compared with yesterday.

The FTSE's nerve-wracking unpredictability came after the Dow Jones plunged to a year low mid-trading
yesterday as the head of the World Bank warned the global economy was 
now 'in a danger zone'.

The volatility in the markets highlighted the inability of politicians and economists around the world to contain the crisis.

Finance ministers from the G20 countries meeting in the U.S. capital pledged yesterday to 'take all necessary actions to preserve the stability of the banking systems and financial markets' and to make sure banks have the cash they need to pay their day-to-day expenses.

'The statement from the G20 last night may have taken the edge off the current bitter market sentiment but the reassurances from the finance ministers lack substance,' said Jane Foley of Rabobank.

'Until politicians back their actions with words in respect to moving closer to a solution to the eurozone debt crisis, markets will continue to worry about a messy and painful outcome from the eurozone debt crisis.'

Wall Street was actually set to open slightly 
higher today. Dow futures were up 0.2 per cent at 10,667 while the broader 
Standard & Poor's 500 futures were up the same rate to 1,125.

'There was a deal in the making which
would have balanced the budget over the long term, but would have 
allowed short-term fiscal stimulus, which would have been the right 
policy'

George Soros, billionaire investor

But there is a continued tension 
after the Federal Reserve's warning earlier this week that the U.S. 
economy faced sizable downside risks.

Investors are also keeping a close
watch on developments in Greece which could default.

Billionaire investor George Soros 
claims the U.S. is already into a double-dip recession and this is down 
to political squabbling and GOP opposition to President Obama’s stimulus
proposals.

‘There was a deal in the making which
would have balanced the budget over the long term, but would have 
allowed short-term fiscal stimulus, which would have been the right 
policy,’ he told CNBC.

Big job: More than 50 per cent of Americans say President Barack Obama, pictured on Thursday, is at fault for the dismal state of the U.S. economy - a majority for the first time since he took office in January 2009

He echoed yesterday’s comments by World Bank President Robert Zoellick by saying the situation in Europe is ‘more dangerous’ to the global economy than when Lehman Brothers went down in 2008.

'The markets are eagerly awaiting a 
resolution or at the minimum, a more rigid strategy to reduce Greece’s 
debt liabilities'Giles Watts, City Index head of equities

'The markets are eagerly awaiting a 
resolution or at the minimum, a more rigid strategy to reduce Greece’s 
debt liabilities,' said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index.

Athens has had a series of meetings 
with its creditors this week to try to avoid that, but it's unclear 
whether it will be able to dig itself out of its debt hole, even with 
the help of billions from the European Union and the International 
Monetary Fund.

Those concerns have knocked 
confidence in the euro over the past week or two. After Thursday's 
plunge it was trading a little bit steadier, up 0.1 per cent at $1.34991.

Several analysts think the current 
respite in the markets was unlikely to last since recent economic data 
from Europe - and even powerhouse China - has been weak and could 
indicate that some major economies are headed back into recession.

We want change: Demostrators have continued to shout outside the New York Stock Exchange this week as they call for action against big businesses and politics

Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the head of the 
French market authority, the AMF, told France Inter radio that 'the 
situation is very, very worrying.

'We are in a worldwide situation of 
crisis,' pointing to debt in Japan, 'imbalances' in the United States, 
and Europe's sovereign debt troubles.

'We must take urgent measures on the international level,' he said.

Joaquin Almunia, who runs the 
department in the EU's executive Commission that has to clear bank 
bailouts, suggested earlier this week that one of those measures may be 
to extend crisis rules that make it easier for governments to rescue 
failing lenders.

He also said that even banks that passed stress tests 
this summer may need to raise more money.

Despite these ongoing concerns, 
benchmark oil rose 35 cents to $80.86 - though that nowhere near makes 
up for its plunge in recent weeks.

As Wall Street suffered its worst day
of 2011 yesterday, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said a ‘steady drip of 
difficult economic news’ was eroding confidence in global markets.

The Dow Jones hit a year low at one point on Thursday, as it fell 500 points in a second consecutive rout since the
Federal Reserve said it was changing strategy for helping the economy.

Blame: This graph shows how much voters blame Mr Bush and Mr Obama for problems facing the economy

Meanwhile, it was revealed more than 50 
per cent of Americans say President Barack Obama is at fault for the 
dismal state of their economy - a majority for the first time since he 
took office in 2009.

The 
poll’s results will be of concern to President Obama, who has always 
insisted he inherited the struggling economy from Mr Bush and has 
criticised the former president’s policies.

'Americans are more likely to blame Bush
than Obama mainly because a much higher percentage of Republicans 
assign a high degree of responsibility to Bush compared with the 
percentage of Democrats blaming Obama'

Gallup

Americans
seem to be unimpressed in general by Mr Obama, although 69 per cent 
said former president George W. Bush bears at least a ‘moderate amount’ 
of the blame for current problems.

Gallup
said 53 per cent of voters say Mr Obama bears at least ‘some’ of the 
blame for a struggling economy, with 24 per cent saying he bears a 
‘great deal of blame’, reported Yahoo News.

‘Americans
are more likely to blame Bush than Obama mainly because a much higher 
percentage of Republicans assign a high degree of responsibility to Bush
compared with the percentage of Democrats blaming Obama,’ a Gallup 
press release said.

The Fed seems to be the only U.S. 
institution with a chance of doing much to help the economy - as 
President Obama’s $447billion package of tax cuts and public spending is
unlikely to pass the House.

Up and down: The Dow Jones has fluctuated by more than 6,000 points since President Obama took office in January 2009, hitting a low of 6,547 in the spring season of his first year

In the first six months of this year, 
the economy grew at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent - the slowest since 
the recession officially ended in June 2009 - and job growth for August 
was an uninspiring zero.

President Obama inherited a high 
unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent when he started out in January 2009 – 
but it has risen to 9.1 per cent since then and is proving hard to push 
down.

'In financial markets, the thinking seems to be: If the Fed is worried, the rest of us ought to be really worried'

Ronald Reagan is 
the only president since World War Two who has won re-election to the 
White House when the unemployment rate was greater than six per cent, 
reported Bloomberg.

A Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll in
June 2008 showed 75 per cent of Americans said the U.S. economy had 
worsened since Mr Bush became president, reported the Huffington Post.

By mid-afternoon on Thursday, at 3:24pm Eastern time, the Dow was down 522, or 4.7 per cent, at 10,601 - a low for the year.

But after a late rebound, the Dow closed down 391
points, or 3.5 per cent, at 10,734. This was just shy of its lowest 
close this year of 10,719 on August 10 - but it did breach this earlier 
in the day.

The Dow has 
fallen more than 15 per cent in two months.

Fluctuations: By mid-afternoon on Thursday, the Dow was down 522, or 4.7 per cent, at 10,601 - a low for the year - but after a late rebound it closed down 391 points, or 3.5 per cent, at 10,734

The
Nasdaq closed down 83 points, or 3.3 per cent, at 2,456, and the 
S&P finished down 37 points, or 3.2 per cent, at 1,130. Nineteen 
stocks fell for every one that rose and trading volume was high.

Economic
news was bad around the world on Thursday, after a European survey 
indicated a recession could be on the way there and a manufacturing 
survey suggested a slowdown in China.

The Fed, adopting a new strategy to try to get the U.S. economy going, announced on Wednesday it would shuffle $400billion of its own holdings in hopes of reducing interest rates on long-term loans.

The central bank hopes that allowing people and businesses to borrow money more cheaply will encourage them to spend it throughout the economy, providing a lift that could turn it around.

But Brian Gendreau, senior investment strategist at Cetera Financial Group, warned: ‘In financial markets, the thinking seems to be: If the Fed is worried, the rest of us ought to be really worried.’

A trio of America’s biggest banks - Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo - had their credit ratings downgraded by leading rating agency Moody’s on Wednesday.
