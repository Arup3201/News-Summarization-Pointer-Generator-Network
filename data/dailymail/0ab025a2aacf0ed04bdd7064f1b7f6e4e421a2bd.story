Terry Grinner isn't like most 17-year-olds. For starters, he's already fought for his life against cancer - and won.

Second, when his parents asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to help him realize his dream, it didn't involve flying in jets, being Batman for a day or any sports team in America.

Tre Grinner's dream is to be an investment banker.

Tre Grinner got to tour the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as part of his dream internship with the Make-A-Wish Foundation

This week, he has been able to realize that dream with the help of Goldman Sachs, one of the most successful - and notorious - investment banks in America.

'I have a deep interest in complicated things. So far, investing has been the most complicated thing I have ever attempted to understand – bonds, futures, IPOs, mergers & acquisitions – and the way they connect to global markets and global news is amazing to me,' he told Business Insider.

In his week-long adventure on Wall Street, Goldman gave him all-star treatment that even some of the most successful bankers are likely to envy.

Business Insider reports that Mr Grinner's itinerary includes an appearance on CNBC's 'Power Lunch,' touring the New York Stock Exchange and meeting traders on the floor,  ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ and a meeting with Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

The California teenager also got a taste of the high life that bankers can enjoy. He was given two made-to-measure Ralph Lauren suits, a pair of designer shoes - and will enjoy a private tour of Yankee Stadium and a meet-and-greet with retiring star Derek Jeter.

'It's meant so much to me. It's something that I've always dreamed of,' Mr Grinner told Business Insider.

Mr Grinner has just finished chemotherapy after being diagnosed last December with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. His parents reached out to Make-A-Wish Foundation as he began to recover. The charity helps make dreams come true for kids who have survived or are going through a life-threatening illness.

Mr Grinner told Business Insider he graduated high school in June and hopes to return to Wall Street after he finishes college.

Goldman Sachs, for it's part, said several managers were so impressed with him, they hope to him from him when he finishes school.
