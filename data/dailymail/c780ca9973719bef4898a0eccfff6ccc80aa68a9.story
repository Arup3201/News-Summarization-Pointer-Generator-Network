Babybell, a black and white stray kitten named after the popular cheese, has been forced to have her right front paw amputated  after getting it caught in a mousetrap while looking for food in Lewknor, South Oxfordshire

The kitten was found injured by a passer-by after getting trapped in a garden and taken to a rescue centre

She was later transferred to an animal hospital in London where vets had no option but amputate her right front leg.

Despite her handicap, vets said she has made a remarkable recovery and will make an adorable pet for one family.

Babybell, who was named after the popular cheese by volunteers at the Blue Cross pet charity where she is recovering, is now five weeks old and is expected to be re-homed next month.

Volunteer Sally Blackman said: 'She is so young and was probably just naive and hungry so went to the mousetrap for food.

'She probably doesn't know anything different than having three legs. She is very resilient.

'She is able to climb up on top of one of the scratching posts with just her three legs. She walks down the corridor and says hello to the other cats and kittens too.

'She is absolutely adorable. She will make a lovely pet.'

Blue Cross volunteer Sally Blackman said it was likely Babybell was looking for food when she got caught in the mousetrap. The kitten is now five weeks old and is on the road to recovery ahead of her re-homing next month

Cristina Bull, a veterinary surgeon at the charity, said the trap had caused irreversible neurological damage which, along with an infection to the wound, had prompted the amputation.

She said: 'Babybell was very lucky she was found otherwise she wouldn't have survived much longer.'

Lisa Kent, the charity's animal welfare assistant, added: 'Babybell is so young that she will adjust well to life with three legs.

Vets believe the young kitten will adjust to life with three legs and will make an adorable pet for a new family

'She's already amazed us all with how well she's doing after her operation.

'She's very sweet and hopefully her disability won't put people off giving her a home.'

Blue Cross has cared for over 40,000 sick, injured and homeless pets every year since it opened the world's first animal hospital in 1906.
