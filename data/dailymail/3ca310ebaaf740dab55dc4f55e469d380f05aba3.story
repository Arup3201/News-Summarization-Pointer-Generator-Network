If you’re the type of woman who calms down quickly after a row, congratulations.

Your relationship is on solid ground – no matter how long your other half sulks for.

According to research, the happiest marriages are those where the wife cools off quickly after a fight, even if her husband stays angry. 

The secret to wedded bliss? When it comes to keeping the peace, it is more important for wives to calm down after a heated argument than husbands

Scientists
 said that women are better at starting those difficult conversations 
that will solve the problem and allow both parties to move on – but only
 if they have regained their composure first.

And ironically, they 
found that if the husband attempts to start those conversations himself,
 his spouse will criticise him for trying to resolve things too quickly.

Lead
 author Lian Bloch, an assistant psychology professor at Berkeley and 
Stanford universities in the US, said: ‘When it comes to managing 
negative emotion during conflict, wives really matter. Emotions such as 
anger and contempt can seem very threatening for couples.

‘But our study suggests that if spouses, especially wives, are able to calm themselves, their marriages can continue to thrive.’

The
 researchers studied more than 80 middle-aged and older couples by 
videotaping them and analysing how they interacted, taking into account 
factors including body language, facial expressions, tone of voice and 
conversation topics.

According to Berkeley College, ‘time and again 
they found that marriages in which wives quickly calmed down during 
disputes were ultimately shown to be the happiest, both in the short 
and long run’.

In contrast, the husband’s emotional regulation had 
‘little or no bearing on long-term marital satisfaction’.

The 
happiest marriages were those in which women used what the researchers 
called ‘constructive communication’ to  temper disagreements.

Berkeley
 College psychologist Robert Levenson, a senior author of the study, 
said: ‘When wives  discuss problems and suggest solutions, it helps 
couples deal with conflicts.

‘This may not work so well for husbands, whom wives often criticise for leaping into problem-solving mode too quickly.’

The
 research was part of the long-term monitoring of 156 heterosexual 
couples in California. Every  five years since 1989 they have updated 
researchers on how happy their marriages are.

Moving on: Time and again, the researchers found that marriages in which wives quickly calmed down during disputes were ultimately shown to be the happiest, both in the short and long run
