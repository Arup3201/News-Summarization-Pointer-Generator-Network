Vandal: Vladimir Umanets said he has made Mark Rothko's work more valuable

More than £9 million could have been 
wiped from the value of a Mark Rothko painting vandalised in London’s 
Tate Modern, a court heard today.

The 1958 work, called ‘Black on 
Maroon’, worth an estimated £50 million before last month’s attack, will
cost £200,000 to restore but may still lose millions from its value.

The irreversible damage to the work 
of art, which will take up to 18 months to repair, was revealed as 
26-year-old Wlodzimierz Umaniec was due to be sentenced today.

Umaniec, who also calls himself 
Vladimir Umanets, calmly signed his name in ink and wrote '12 A 
potential piece of Yellowism' on the Rothko canvas in front of horrified
art-lovers at the South Bank gallery.

However, his sentencing was postponed to allow for the preparation of reports

Inner London Crown court heard there 
may need to be a Newton hearing - a trial by judge - to decide whether 
Umaniec should be sentenced on the basis of repair costs or the 
devaluation of the painting.

Gareth Morgan, representing Umaniec 
who has already pleaded guilty to a single charge of criminal damage, 
said that an expert had claimed that the value lost could be 'between £5
million and £9.3 million'.

Tate Modern went into lockdown after 
the ink pen was used to scribble on the canvas, but by that time 
Umaniec had already left.

The former graphic designer and 
cleaner, who was born in Russia but had been living in a squat in 
Feltham, west London, was arrested by police the next day after giving a
number of interviews to the media.

Umaniec, now of Worthing, West 
Sussex, originally claimed to have added value to the work, but pleaded 
guilty to causing criminal damage in excess of £5,000 on Sunday October 
7th when he appeared before magistrates.

Art? Mr Umanets insists his graffiti is part of a movement called 'Yellowism'

The defaced painting was one of a 
series, known as the Seagram murals, gifted to the Tate by the artist in
1969, just before his death.

The court heard because the painting 
has never been sold it has no formal value, but experts have estimated 
it to be around £50million.

Restorers will now have to 
painstakingly strip away the damaged layers, which the pen soaked 
through right to the back of the canvas, and re-build them in imitation 
of Rothko’s workings, a process which the gallery has confirmed could 
take 18 months.

Gregor McKinlay, prosecuting, said: 
'This is something that will, because of what’s happened, suffer a 
reduction in overall value.

'This is something that simply cannot be restored to its original state because it is an original work of art.'

Eminent: The defaced painting was one of a series, known as the Seagram murals, gifted to the Tate by the Mark Rothko, left, in 1969, just before his death. Pictured right is the Tate modern, where the attack took place

However, Mr Morgan said: 'The court 
should proceed to sentence the defendant on the remedial costs, the 
restoration costs, which are set to some £200,000, rather than at the 
suggested value of reduction.

Umaniec founded the ‘Yellowist’ movement which describes itself as 'not art or anti-art', with Marcin Lodyga.

After the vandalism Lodgya wrote on their website: 'Unfortunately Tate will not keep the 
inscription and therefore will 'deface' something very special.

'But, regardless of what Tate will do with it, Rothko’s painting will be always remembered as a potential piece of yellowism.'

Influential: Work by Rothko regularly sells for tens of millions of pounds. (Left) his 1954 Homage to Matisse and (right) For Reds, from 1957

Targeted: The vandalised artwork, right, has been valued at ten million pounds

Judge Robert Fraser said it was 
'inescapable' that the reduction in value would have to be taken into 
account at sentence. It will be decided later today whether a Newton 
hearing will take place.

But Judge Robert Fraser, who will not be carrying out the sentence, said that 'at this stage' such a hearing was unnecessary.

He
warned Umaniec: 'This is a very serious matter. You do face the 
likelihood of an immediate custodial sentence. I don’t want you to go 
away with any false hopes.'

Leaving
court Umaniec said he did not wish to speak to the press. Adding: 'I 
don’t want to be known in the context of this case where everybody 
thinks of me as a bad guy.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
