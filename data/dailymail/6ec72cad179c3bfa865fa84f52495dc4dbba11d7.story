Forget give the dog a bone, this little pup wants a slice of ice.

YouTube user 4score1957 from California filmed Walter the German Shepherd determinedly trying to get his paws on an ice cube.

It takes him just over three minutes to finally get the lump of frozen water inbetween his teeth.

At one point he growls at the slippery lump as his frustration mounts. 'Get it Walter!' a woman encourages in the background.

After numerous attempts, the pup finally gets his mouth on the prize. His audience give him a big 'good boy' in celebration.

Walter was eight weeks old when the ice cube debacle was filmed.

He has since grown into an adult size.

Apparently he's ditched ice cubes and prefers getting his paws on beer.

To date the video of Walter attempting to eat ice has been watched more than 13,000 times.

One viewer said their dog had the same reaction when they first came face to face with the chilly blocks.Â
