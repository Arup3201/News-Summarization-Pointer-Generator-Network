Paul Scholes has accused Lionel Messi and many of Barcelona's stars of being 'bored' with their tiki-taka playing style and not putting in the same effort as they did when Pep Guardiola was manager.

Scholes described playing against Barcelona in their pomp as a 'soul-destroying experience'. Guardiola's side - arguably the greatest team in modern club football - beat Scholes's Manchester United in two Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011.

But the Red Devils legend gave a damning verdict of the current team playing under Luis Enrique after going to watch Barca's 1-0 victory against Valencia at the Mestalla last Sunday. Scholes watched the game along with former team-mate Phil Neville and their fellow Salford City investor Peter Lim, who owns Valencia.

'For much of the game I felt they were a ghost of the side they had once been,' wrote Scholes in his latest column for the Independent. The former England midfielder also wrote that Barcelona's 'speed and penetration have gone'.

'When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word “bored”,' added Scholes. 

'It just seems the most accurate way to describe the way the team seem to treat the style of football that once made them the best side on the planet.'

Xavi and Sergio Busquets were two of the Barca stars responsible for making their short-passing style the envy of world football, but both played in the Barca team Scholes branded bored with the tactics. Busquets scored the winning goal in the final minute of the game. 

Scholes also confessed he thought Neymar was 'a bit lightweight'. 

But while admitting that Messi's goalscoring feats over the last decade 'put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game', Scholes also said that the Argentina forward no longer works as hard as he did during Barca's glory days.

'In him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom,' said Scholes. 'He has never been a player given to chasing the full-back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum.'

Barcelona lost out on the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid last season and watched as bitter rivals Real Madrid became European champions. Their last major trophy was the Spanish league title in 2013 under Tito Vilanova's management.

Guardiola won three La Liga titles, the Copa del Rey twice, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups, as well as the two Champions League crowns in four years at the Nou Camp from 2008.
