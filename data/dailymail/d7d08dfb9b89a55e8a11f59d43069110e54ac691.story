The days of awkwardly trying to get everyone in the frame of a video might be over.

A team of former Apple engineers have developed an interactive panoramic camera.

It can be held in the palm of your hand and it records everything around it, through a total of 360°.

The Centr camera (pictured) is a small device that can generate 360-degree HD video in real-time. The device was created by a team of former Apple engineers and has been used by the US military

Dubbed the Centr Camera, the team are currently looking for funding on Kickstarter.

It is touted as a new way to capture videos of the world around you.

And its innovative design ensures you’ll get uninterrupted footage.

‘Centr allows you to capture your experiences and share them in a whole new way,’ the company writes on Kickstarter.

‘Capture 360° video in real-time on a camera that fits in the palm of your hand.

‘With decades of experience working on cameras at Apple, the Centr team knows what it takes to bring beautiful design and groundbreaking technology together in one product.’

The device has four HD cameras fitted to it, which are embedded in a ring design.

A hole in the middle lets you easily hold the camera while keeping the view of the cameras unobstructed.

The camera can also be placed on top of Centr’s dual-use mount.

As you take footage software within the camera converts what the four cameras see into a single interactive video.

Using Centr's software, you can then move and zoom around the video when you play it back.

It has a whole host of applications, such as watching different parts of the action at sporting events or capturing moments with all of your friends in the shot.

On batteries or the supplied battery pack it can shoot HD video for about 2 hours, or it can be used to take photos for five hours.

The camera is compatible with an official app on iOS, with an Android app also in the works.

The Centr camera allows you to get new views when taking video. As the video plays you can scroll and zoom around it with your mouse of finger, depending on what device you are using. The team are currently looking for funding on Kickstarter

Centr uses four HD cameras to capture footage, which is then stitched together by software into an interactive panoramic video. You can also record out of each camera individually if you don't want to shoot in 360-degrees

Four HD cameras are positioned around the ring.

These each capture footage at 60fps with a 4K panoramic video resolution.

Software in the camera stitches together the footage from each camera into a 360° video.

The videos are interactive, so you can move and zoom around while watching them.

Each can be viewed on a computer, smartphone or tablet in real-time via Wi-Fi with Centr’s interactive player.

If you don’t want to shoot in 360° you can individually select one of the cameras.

Centr can also take 20 megapixel time-lapse panoramic photos.

The product seems to be a competitor with other ‘on-the-go’ cameras such as GoPro’s devices.

But Centr is the first to provide 360-degree capability.

Their device has already attracted the attention of several companies including Fox and ESPN.

It has also been picked up by the US Department of Defense, who have used the Centr camera in tandem with forward-looking infrared (FLIR) technology.

In place of regular cameras, the battlefield version uses four FLIR camera on top of soldiers’ helmets to record what’s going on around them in infrared.

This data can then be used by drones flying overhead to locate targets.

And Centr say there could be many other applications for their camera.

It will go on sale to the public in February 2015, with a retail price of $399 (£235).
