First came KFC's now infamous Double Down, a heart attack waiting to happen, which saw the usual burger bun replaced with pieces of chicken.

The fast food chain marketed it as a sort of 'sandwich' despite the meaty meal consisting of bacon, two types of cheese and a special sauce crammed between the crumbed chicken - with no bread in sight.

But now South Korea has taken the concept and stepped it up a notch, with the addition of a slab of beef smack bang in the middle of the burger - turning it into the Double Down King.

South Korea has taken the KFC Double Down and added a beef patty to the bacon and chicken 'burger'

Now a quadruple-meat concoction, KFC offers hungry customers two pieces of crumbed chicken, bacon, and a beef patty coated in a two types of sauce for what works out be less than $10 Australian.

It weighs in at 750 calories, which is about a third of an adults recommended daily intake.

As for whether it's coming to Australia, KFC told Daily Mail Australia there was something else in store for their customers Down Under.

'At the moment, the burger is only launching in South Korea. The Double always creates a lot of hype in Australia and we’ll be giving our fans something to get really excited about in early November,' a spokeswoman said. 

The original Double Down was first released in America in April 2010, and consisted of two pieces of bacon and two melted slices of cheese, slathered in mayonnaise and sandwiched between two slices of chicken.

Last year they came up with the Double Down Maxx, which had a hash brown sandwiched between the chicken

Nutritionists were horrified by the launch of the super fatty dish in a country where two-thirds of the population is overweight or obese.

KFC insists the sandwich contains 540 calories - but it was reported that it actually racked up a much higher figure of 1,228, or about half of a man's recommended daily intake.

The 'burger' has also been released in Australia - first in March 2011 for a few weeks before it made a brief re-appearance on the market in June 2014.

Last year in South Korea the first adaptation of the meal for meatlovers was dubbed the Double Down Maxx. 

This version of the fast food feast kept the concept of having chicken as the bun, but added a hash brown, cheese and a variation of sauce for the filling.
