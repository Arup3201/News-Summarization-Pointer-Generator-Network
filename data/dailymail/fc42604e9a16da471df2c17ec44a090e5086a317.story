A fugitive convicted of gang-raping an 11-year-old Texas girl has been caught after a massive manhunt.

Police tracked down Eric McGowen, 20, to an apartment complex in Houston and handcuffed him while he was sitting on the toilet at around 9am on Tuesday.

McGowen disappeared during his trial late last month but the shocking case continued without him.

McGowen was sentenced to 99 years in prison on August 30 after a jury found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child in the first trial stemming from the horrific gang-rape of the 11-year-old Cleveland girl.

Capt. Steve Greene of the Liberty County Sheriff's Office said McGowen was taken into custody without resisting after being apprehended by police.

Greene thanked the Texas Rangers, U.S. Marshals Office, Gulf Coast Violent Offender Task Force, the Liberty County Sheriff's Office, Houston Police Department and Harris County Sheriff's Office for their roles in the arrest.

According to ABC News, authorities had information that McGowen was hiding out with relatives.

Officers pulled over a family member during a traffic stop, at which point that person confessed that McGowen had been staying with them. The relatives involved may face charges for harbouring a fugitive.

Three other men accused in the girl's gang rape accepted plea deals last week rather than go to trial.

McGowen
escaped during a break in proceedings on August 29 - the first day of his trial at the courthouse in Liberty - and had been missing since.

Judge Mark Morefield chose to push 
ahead with the trial without the defendant, calling the remaining 
witnesses. Jurors deliberated for just 20 minutes before  finding the missing man guilty and after another 30 minutes they had decided his sentence.

McGowen
was convicted for his part in 
the shocking attacks, which saw the girl, now 13, gang-raped by 20 men 
and boys on multiple occasions in an abandoned trailer.

His lawyer didn’t present any evidence or call witnesses at the trial.

McGowen was one of 14 adults accused 
of having sex with the girl. Six boys also are charged in the case.

Greene said courthouse security wasn't required to follow McGowen when he fled the courtroom because he was out on bail.

Greene
said the sheriff's office was notified by the court bailiff when the 
defendant didn't return after the afternoon coffee break. At the time, he warned that
McGowen should be considered armed and dangerous.

Judge Morefield issued a warrant for McGowen's arrest and hiked the man's bail from $35,000 to $250,000.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys 
huddled briefly with the judge in front of his bench
when the defendant, who was wearing a white shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, vanished after sitting through the bulk of the day's proceedings, including his victim's testimony.

McGowen's attorney Matthew Poston said he thought his client was in the bathroom when he didn't return to his seat.

Before McGowen vanished, the victim broke down in court as she watched a video of one of the painful attacks.

Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010

The
girl, who authorities haven't named, testified against McGowen, describing the series of horrendous attacks that took 
place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston.

In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. 

The girl said she was brought into 
what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and
others took turns having sex with her.

Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly.

But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks.

She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case.

She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.'

'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked.

'Yes sir,' the girl said.

The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified.

She
mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the 
floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding.

She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants 
called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that 
continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer.

Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.'

Jurors
were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers 
found inside and outside the house in the November incident.

Three people who have pleaded guilty — two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 — also testified yesterday.

Isaiah Ross, 22, told jurors he saw McGowen sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle.

The other adult, Marcus Porchia, 28, and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not McGowen.

Poston
questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked 
whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never 
had sex with McGowen.

The girl said she didn’t remember saying that.

During
opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present 
them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted 
to raping the girl.

'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said.

The prosecutor added that while the 
girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, 
these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things 
against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle.

Authorities say the then 11-year-old was 
assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December 
2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student 
to a 28-year-old.

During the trial,
a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight 
other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, 
was shown in court, although jurors were not present.

In the video, which McGowen's lawyers
argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially 
denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told 
investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston 
Chronicle.

Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen.

The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer.

Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records.

The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents.

Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions.

It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic.

Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing.

Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time.

Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.
