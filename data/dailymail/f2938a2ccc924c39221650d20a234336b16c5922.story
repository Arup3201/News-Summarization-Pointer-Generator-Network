Video footage shows the heart stopping moment a 17 year old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark.

Sam Smith's Go-Pro vision helmet captured the sudden and brief attack while he was spear fishing on the New South Wales south coast on Friday.

The teenager can be seen trying to stab the shark with his spear gun as the 1.5 metre predator aggressively lashes out and bites the boy's hand before swimming out of sight.

Channel Seven released the footage on Sunday as one of Sydney's most popular beaches was shut down following a shark sighting at Manly beach.

Fishing off Mollymook Beach with his friend Luke Sisinni, Sam went under the water to film the 1.5metre shark when the frightening incident happened.

Paramedics rushed to the scene just before midday on Friday, as hundreds of children competing in the 2015 Stramit NSW Country Surf Life Saving Championships looked on.

Mr Smith was fishing when he saw the shark and tried to go down to film it, according to his friend Luke Sisinni, the Milton Ulladulla Times reported.

'He said it spun around and started coming for him, so he stabbed it with his spear to try and scare it off, but it just went ballistic and bit him,' Mr Sisinni said.

'[Sam] came up screaming saying "I got bitten by a shark"'. 

Two ambulances arrived at the beach and the boy was treated with lacerations to his left hand, including multiple lacerations to his fingers.

The boy was taken to Milton Ulladulla hospital where he is in a stable condition, and later flown to Sydney for specialist treatment.

Just two days after Sam's lucky escape, Manly beach was closed after a swimmer raised the alarm after spotting an unspecified type of shark in the water at around 1.30pm.

But the warning did not deter many people who proceeded to continue swimming in the sea despite being told by lifeguards 

A Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman said inflatable rescue boats were used to chase the shark away and the beach would reopen once it was deemed safe again. 

'The problem is there were already a lot of swimmers and surfers in the water who won't come out,' she said.

'We suggest that if people continue to stay in the water they're doing so at their own risk.'

Beachgoers flocked to Manly despite earlier reports of a shark sighting

Meanwhile, Newcastle beach remains closed for ninth consecutive day from a sighting.

The sea off Newcastle was first declared a no-go area when a five-metre great white shark was seen at Merewether Beach on January 10.

A helicopter crew spent Sunday scouring the ocean for signs of the fearsome predator, nicknamed Bruce, along with a three-and-a-half metre shark that lunched on a dolphin last week.

Neither have been spotted since Friday but Surf Life Saving NSW said no decision on reopening the beaches would be made until Monday.

Shark attacks have also closed other NSW beaches in recent days.

Lifeguards were also stopping people from going in the water at Port Kembla and Windang beaches near Wollongong on Sunday.

The Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman said this was due to a dead seal and injured shark that had both been attacked by what was believed to be a much larger shark.

A surf competition - the Stramit NSW Country Life Saving Championships - was today being held at the beach.

Surf LIfe Saving NSW tweeted that lifeguards have closed Narrawellee Beach to the north of the headland. 

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia police were aware of the situation.
