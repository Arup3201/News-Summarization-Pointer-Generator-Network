Their famous partners could not be more different - one is in training to be a future king, while the other is the first British male to win Wimbledon since the 1930s.

But the lives of Kim Sears, 26, and the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, have taken a remarkably similar path since the early Noughties.

Yesterday, after nine years together, Kim and Andy Murray, 27, announced their engagement.

The 26-year-old and the Duchess of Cambridge (right) have followed similar path in their adult lives, including long courtships before getting engaged to famous men. Like Kate, Kim has had a style transformation into a fashion icon

The couple have had one of the longest courtships in recent British showbiz history - much like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, there has been constant speculation about when they would finally get hitched. 

But that isn't the only similarity between the two women.

Kim has also chosen to shun the limelight, provided a rare constant in her boyfriend's ever-changing environment and quietly established herself as a modern style icon for young women. 

Like William and Kate, Andy and Kim have been together for most of their adult lives. 

Kate and William met while they were both studying at the University of St Andrews and began their romance in late 2003.

Kim and Andy met in 2005 at the US Open when they were both just 17 years old - Kim was travelling with her father Nigel, who was head of the Women's Tennis Association at the time.

The couple were introduced at a party and hit it off, but according to reports, Andy chased the shy school student for several months before she agreed to go out with him.

Kim kept such a low profile that the press were completely unaware of their relationship until Andy kissed her on camera during the SAP Open in San Jose in 2006. 

After winning two matches against Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick at the tournament, Andy celebrated by jumping into the stands and embracing Kim - an exercise that he has completed several times since. 

Andy was Kim's first serious boyfriend. In fact, the East Sussex-born brunette had kept a low profile at Burgess Hill school, with her nose mainly stuck in books.

A fellow pupil said after they left: 'At school she was seen as a bit of a goody-goody who got on with her work and was very reserved.

'She was very clever but she was quite shy and seemed very innocent.'

Like Kate, Kim was a keen sportswoman at school and did very well in her A-Levels, getting straight A's in drama, music and art before going on to study English Literature at the University of Sussex in Brighton.

Kate graduated from Marlborough with almost identical grades, she obtained two A's in maths and art,  and a B in English. 

In the early days of their relationship, Kim worked in a shop in Brighton to support herself during her studies. 

Her busy schedule meant that she and Andy lived largely independent lives, something that he has since credited with one of the reasons for their romance lasting. 

In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said: 'She doesn’t come to loads of tournaments as I also find being away from each other is good as well. 

'If you spend three months in a row together, by the end of it we’re like, you know, arguing and stuff.'

In a separate interview, he also claimed that she had better things to do that follow him around the globe. 

He said: 'She doesn't want to follow me around on tour. 

'She wants to have her own career, not just pose in Hello magazine.'

The Duke of Cambridge uttered similar sentiments about his now wife in an interview in 2010 about their brief break-up. 

He said: 'It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up, and so it was just sort of a bit of space and a bit of things like that and it worked out for the better.'

It isn't just both Andy and Kim's strong streaks of independence that has helped with the pressures of Andy's global career, her calm personality has also been credited for keeping the tennis star grounded ahead of important matches.  

His mother Judy claimed that she is one of the best things that had ever happened to her son and Andy has previously admitted that Kim is one of the few people that he even talks to during high-pressure tournaments. 

He said: 'I work better in a relationship. 

'At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff.

'You're in these huge cities meeting new people all the time and it would be easy to get your head turned. 

'But Kim has always been there for me. 

'She really cares about me and helps with so many things. She always has. That's why we have such a great relationship.'

Although they are often apart for large periods of time, their home life is incredibly stable.  

After just a few years together, the couple moved into a £5 million house in Oxshott, Surrey where they still live with their two border terriers, Rusty and Maggie. 

Kim is so obsessed with dogs that she has built up a successful art business online, painting portraits of people's pets.  

She regularly showcases her work on her website KimSears.com. 

Kate is also a huge fan of dogs - she likes them so much that her brother James gifted the couple with their cocker spaniel Lupo for their wedding present. 

Apart from art and dogs, her interests include long walks in the English countryside, Classic FM, country music and Jilly Cooper novels. 

In fact, she is such a fan of the romantic books that her collection started to fall apart from over-reading. 

She once said: 'To label (Jilly) as ‘summer reading’ does her a complete disservice.

'I would have honestly written my dissertation on her if I was permitted.

'I own two copies of (her book) Polo because on the third time of reading I had to hold the book together with a clothes peg as all the pages were dropping out.'

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, a bouncy blow dry has become a hallmark of Kim's style 

Kim and Kate both have an enviable wardrobe for official events 

While the couple have had a largely stable relationship, like William and Kate, Andy and Kim split briefly a few years after their romance started. 

In November 2009, the couple announced that they had broken up and Kim had moved out of their mansion and back into her family home.

Reports at the time blamed several issues, including Andy's addiction to video games. 

But the break didn't last long - seven months later they were back together.

Prince William and Kate Middleton split in March 2007 but got back together just a few months later at a party in June. 

Since Kim and Andy's reconciliation, the pressure for the couple to get engaged has been relentless. 

Much like with Kate, regular press reports questioned how long Kim would wait to get a ring on her finger, despite repeated affirmations from the couple that Kim was focusing on choosing her career path. 

So frustrated with the questioning, Andy sent a jokey tweet earlier this year in a Q&A with fans on Twitter, saying: 'We're getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day,' but he was forced to retract the statement by his PR agency and admit it was said in jest.

In 2013, he cut down Holly Willoughby during a television interview after the presenter asked when he would be asking for his girlfriend's hand in marriage. 

She had said: 'I'm trying to think what you're next challenge will be.

'You've had the US Open, the Olympics, now Wimbledon, could it be popping the question?' 

He replied: 'I only met you like ten minutes ago so I wouldn't be telling you first.' 

Now that the pair have finally announced official plans to tie the knot, the focus will surely turn to Kim's choice of wedding dress. 

Since she first arrived on the scene as Andy's girlfriend, her hair and clothes have taken on an increasingly polished appearance, much like the Duchess of Cambridge.

Kim's fashion choices are now a hot topic at every Wimbledon and in 2013, The Telegraph even claimed that 'Kim Sears reinvents the WAG at Wimbledon.'

The pair are now regulars on the front row at London Fashion Week. 

As well as planning for a wedding, Murray fans could also be looking forward to the arrival of a new tennis prodigy in the next few years, as Andy recently talked about his desire to start a family. 

He said last year: 'I can see myself having a family one day. 

'It is something that I'm starting to think about.'
