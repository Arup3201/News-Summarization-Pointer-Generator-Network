Not even dying in an alley way and being brought back to life at least twice by paramedics stopped former ice junkie Jack Nagle from doing anything to get his next hit.

‘I was with these people taking a whole bunch of drugs then they just left me there,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The second I discharged myself from hospital I went and used straight away.'

Jack's spiral into drug addiction began with marijuana when he was about 14 before he started using harder drugs by the age of 17.

But the moment he smoked ice for the first time in a car in his home town of Melbourne he was hooked and his life transcended into a drug-fuelled haze of smoking and injecting as much crystal methamphetamine as the then 19 year-old could get his hands on.

Jack Nagle says he was hooked from the very first time he smoked ice in a car in Melbourne four years ago

Now 23, Jack said he quickly descended from a happy-go-lucky, kind-hearted and cheeky kid into a manipulative, deceitful, cowardly, unstable and pathetic person.

As a teen, he was a talented and 'incredibly fit' basketballer who went over to America for a month to try out for basketball scholarships.

But Jack's life could not have ended up taking more of an unexpected turn.

The Truman Show is simply an entertaining movie for most people but for Jack, he had the starring role.

‘The last six months I was completely nuts and in a constant psychosis – highly paranoid about everything and delusional,’ he said.

‘Then it started to get to the point when I thought everyone around me was a paid actor looking into my life.’

‘It was so extreme near the end that I would black out and be in such a psychotic state that I would think I was flying to Thailand but just be sitting on the sofa, then within that I would have moments of clarity which was really strange.'

For at least six months, Jack was desperate to get clean but he couldn't beat his addiction.

‘I would get home every night and say to myself "I can’t do this anymore" and then as soon as I woke up in the morning I would just use again,' he said.

'I was just stuck. It was almost like I was looking at myself from the outside but just couldn’t stop - I was in the grips of obsession and compulsion.

‘As much as I would take my mind away about not thinking about using I would go back there – it wasn’t a case of wanting to do it – it was more of a case of having to.’

It wasn’t until 12 months later when Jack stole $7,500 and went on a week-long bender that he had the profound moment of taking a good look at himself in the mirror.

‘I stayed up for over a week and a half and just lost my mind completely so when I came out of all of that I went and knocked on my mum’s door and asked for help,’ he said.

‘It sounds cliché but my life flashed before my eyes – I was a young fit happy basketballer and had turned into a stereotypical junkie.’

After a very challenging and tumultuous 12 months in rehabilitation, Jack has been clean for the past three years and has no doubt in his mind where he would have ended up if he didn’t turn up on his mother’s doorstep that day.

‘Jails, institutions or death basically – the bitter end – any of those three,’ he said.

Now a manager of a rehab clinic, Jack looks at media reports of other ice junkies, such as the former NSW premier’s daughter Harriet Wran, who has been charged with murder, who didn’t get out in time and thinks of what could have been.

‘I feel grateful and lucky that I got the right help and my self-esteem is back,’ he said. ‘To look at me you would never know – I’ve had a complete attitude shift.’

The support he received while recovering has led him to work as a manager at DayHab - Addiction Treatment Centre Melbourne for the past year.

‘It’s quite hard and stressful but it’s awesome – I love it’ he said. ‘I can help because I know what they are going through.’

However, Jack was not delusional about how easy it was to relapse with addictions - particularly ice.

‘Look I’ll be honest it’s always on the cards,’ he admitted. ‘Just because you stop doesn’t mean you beat it, basically.'

‘There is this saying once you stop - your addiction is doing push-ups in the background in the car park,’ he said.

‘So even if you’re not using, it progresses, so if I was to go and pick up again I would probably be straight back to where I was before in a matter of weeks, and probably worse.’
