The search for a 19 year-old Irish surfer who went missing after he was caught in a rip with two mates off Cape Byron has continued into Sunday.

Rescue teams are facing treacherous conditions as they search waters off northern NSW.

The group went surfing at around 10.35am on Saturday, and got into trouble in a strong rip off the north corner of Tallow Beach.

A 26-year-old man was located in waters a short distance away and did not suffer any injuries while another man, 20, was found on rocks with minor injuries.

Dangerous: The surfer was off Tallow Beach in New South Wales when he was swept away by a rip tide 

Surf Life Saving Far North Coast Duty Officer Jimmy Keogh said the dangerous surf conditions and fading light caused the search to be suspended on Saturday night.

SLSNSW's Elton Cummings said patient one was treated by ambulance officers on the beach while patient two who was also located, was very distressed about the third person.

‘Apparently he was right behind him - but so far the search has failed to located this person,’ Mr Cummings said on Saturday evening. ‘We are very concerned about this third person.’

He said the jet ski crews found it difficult to stay in the cold water for any length of time.

With rough seas hitting the NSW coast this weekend, the Roads and Maritime Services are urging all boat users to take extreme care on the waters on Sunday.
