The father of a young man who lost both his legs after Monday's bomb blasts only discovered his son was hurt when he saw his picture on the TV news.

Jeff Bauman Sr had been desperately trying to contact his son, Jeff Bauman Jr, when he took a call from his anguished step-daughter asking: 'Did you see the picture?'

Mr Bauman, 52, then turned on the TV news to see the ashen face of his son, who was being wheeled away from the site of the blast with a horrifically injured lower leg.

Horrified, he then rang around local hospitals in a desperate bid to find 27-year-old Jeff, who had been at the Boston marathon to cheer on his girlfriend.

Help: The speed of first responders and volunteers on the scene helped save lives, like that of Jeff Bauman who was seriously injured in one of the blasts

The picture he saw that confirmed that his son was dead has become an iconic image of Monday's atrocities which left three dead and more than 180 injured.

It shows his burnt, bloodied and maimed son being pushed by first responders in a wheelchair while another man in a cowboy hat - who it later transpired had saved his life - helped stem the blood loss.

Mr Bauman spoke of his family's shock as doctors treating the injured said they hoped there would be no further deaths as a result of the bombs.

Medics at hospitals across Boston who are treating the casualties said they had seen head injuries, broken bones, and limb amputations.

They also had to deal with children with nails sticking out of their bodies as a result of the explosives hidden in bags near the race finish line.

Injured Mr Bauman Jr, who works at Costco and is planning to go back to school when he has paid off his student loans, was at the race to cheer on his girlfriend Erin Hurley, who was running her first Boston Marathon.

His father said he rang his son's cellphone the minute he heard about the bombs, but despite repeated calls over an hour, he got no answer.

Then his step-daughter Erika rang him and asked: 'Did you see the picture?'

Mr Bauman Sr shouted: 'Are you sure?  Are you sure?', the New York Times reports.  His step-daughter said she was sure as she had seen his picture on the news.

Mr Bauman Sr turned on his TV and internet to be confronted with the graphic evidence that confirmed his son was seriously injured.

The picture he found was not the whole picture, which showed in horrifying detail how the younger Mr Bauman had had one leg torn off at the knee, but a cropped version as shown above.

Later he posted the picture on his Facebook account, with the simple comment: 'Here is the photo that I saw on the news'.

His horrified father than rang around local hospitals in a desperate bid to find the son who was obviously badly wounded.  When he found his son was at Boston Medical Center he and his wife Csilla left their home in Conchord, N.H. and reached the hospital at 8pm.

Mr Bauman Sr was told his son had already had both legs amputated at the knee, and had to be resuscitated and given blood several times during surgery because he had lost so much blood.

His father learnt he had been the first casualty to arrive at the center, and discovered that the young man probably owed his surviving the attacks to the man in the cowboy hat in the photograph with him.

Carlos Arredondo, who was handing out American flags to spectators when the bombs went off, has been credited with saving Jeff Bauman Jr's life

Costa Rican immigrant Carlos Arredondo, 52, leapt into action when he saw Mr Bauman Jr lying horrifically injured by the blasts.

He jumped over a fence, ran towards Mr Bauman Jr and hauled him into a wheelchair before tying a shirt around one leg to act as a tourniquet and pinching his femoral artery to stem blood-loss while two emergency responders wheeled the injured young man to an ambulance.

Mr Bauman Sr was told the man, who lost his Marine son Alexander in Iraq in 2004, had saved his son's life.

Jeff Bauman Jr was watching his girlfriend run her first Boston Marathon when he was badly injured by the explosions at the finishing line

That night, as he waited for his son to have further surgery to drain a fluid build-up caused by the trauma, he wrote on his Facebook page: 'Can everyone pray for my Son Jeff jr who was at the finish line today in Boston. He is in surgery right now with injuries to his legs. I just can't explain whats wrong with people today to do this to people. I'm really starting to lose faith in our country.'

Meanwhile, doctors treating the injured at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) said they were confident no further lives would be lost as a result of Monday's bombs.

Trauma surgeon Dr George Velmahos told a press conference: 'I am confident that no further lives will be lost.  Overall (it’s) an optimistic message at this point.'

He said the hospital has a total of six or seven patients who are still in critical condition, but added that some of them were awake and their conditions had significantly improved since yesterday morning.

He said doctors there had performed four amputations so far, with two further patients at risk of needing amputations.

Fox News reported that most of the bombing victims suffered from traumatic injuries to their lower extremities, according to trauma surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital, where 31 victims were treated.

Doctors said they removed sharp, metal objects from children and adults injured by the explosions.

More than 170 people were hurt by the blasts, with injuries including broken bones, amputated limbs and head injuries.

Dr David Mooney, director of the trauma center at Boston Children's Hospital, said: 'We've removed BBs and we've removed nails from kids.

'One of the sickest things for me was just to see nails sticking out of a little girl's body.'

Two children remain in critical condition at the hospital with serious leg injuries.

Dr Mooney said that tourniquets applied by emergency responders at the race saved the children's lives.

Doctors at MGH said they removed metal fragments from victims of the two bombs.

Stephen Epstein of the emergency medicine department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre said he saw an X-ray of one victim's leg that had 'what appears to be small, uniform, round objects throughout it - similar in the appearance to BBs.'
