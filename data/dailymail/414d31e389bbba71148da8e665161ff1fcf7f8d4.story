Authorities in Houston, Texas are offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for maiming a local pit bull. 

A volunteer at the nonprofit Barrio Dogs spotted a grey pitbull wandering the streets of East Houston on March 18, and noticed a horrifying site when he got close to the dog.

The dog's ears had been sliced off and it had also had a stab wound to his head. 

Cropping ears is sometimes a practice carried out by dog fighters, but it doesn't involve taking the full ear off, as was the case in the stray found last week.

Painful: A pitbull was found roaming the streets of East Houston last week with its ears cut off 

Animal abuse: Crime Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for maiming the dog, now named Hotch

'It's heartbreaking that someone would do this,' Barrio Dog volunteer Ernie Zenteno told KHOU. 'Animal cruelty, that's what this is.'

The volunteer took the dog, which has since been named Hotch, to the Gulfgate Animal Hospital where veterinarians worked to treat its wounds. 

Gulfgate's Dr Sherry Corona says Hotch's ear had become infected but the dog will make a full recovery. 

Barrio Dogs will now be placing Hotch with a foster family until a permanent adoption can be sorted.

Recovering: Hotch will be placed in a foster home until a permanent adoption can be organized. Veterinarians say he will make a full recovery

In the meantime, investigators in Houston are searching for the person or persons responsible for carrying out the heinous act of animal abuse. 

Authorities believe someone living in the neighborhood where Hotch was found may be responsible, and Crime Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to a suspect's arrest.  

The maiming of Hotch in Houston follows a similar incident late last month in Tulsa, Oklahoma - about seven hour drive north. 

A man there had his 2-month-old pitbull of the same color stolen on February 26. A few days later he found pieces of the puppy's ears in his backyard.    

Who did this? Authorities believe the person responsible for butchering off Hotch's ears may live in the neighborhood where the dogs was found. A view of the neighborhood above
