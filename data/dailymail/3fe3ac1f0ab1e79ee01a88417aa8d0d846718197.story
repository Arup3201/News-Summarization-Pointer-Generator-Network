Louis van Gaal has revealed he let his Holland team spend time with their wives and girlfriends ahead of the 5-1 World Cup win against Spain.

Managers have often acted cautiously about the amount of time their players spend socialising before big games, preferring them instead to focus on the task in hand rather than indulge distractions.

But Van Gaal, took the opposite approach and was rewarded handsomely as world and European champions Spain were taken apart by Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

'My principle is the overall picture,' Van Gaal is quoted as saying in the Mirror. 'The total person. The player.

'His brain and his psyche plays a part. And the psyche is influenced by his environment.

'So on Thursday and this morning I gave permission for the wives to visit the hotel and so the players could be happy.

'But that doesn’t mean this is the reason for our victory.

'I told the players I would make sure there would be points in time where the wives and families would visit them.'

'We have enough players who will make sure that we don’t lose ourselves in euphoria," he said.

'We played in a fantastic way, compact football. We used our centre-forwards perfectly.'

And Van Gaal, who will take over at Manchester United after the World Cup, also warned that Holland can get even better.

'Yes, we can get better, without a shadow of a doubt,' he said.

'You could see this in the last 20 minutes when we started to play the ball around with confidence.

'Then you could see how good these players can be. This result gives them confidence and I expect them to get better.'
