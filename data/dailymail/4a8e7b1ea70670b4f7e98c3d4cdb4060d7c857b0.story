As revealed by Sportsmail's Charles Sale, the Premier League are exploring the possibility of a live Sunday night fixture in an attempt to keep Sky Sports and BT Sport happy.

With competition between the two broadcasters stiffer than ever, the Premier League are looking into creating another live television slot when the next three-year agreement comes into effect in the 2016-17 season.

But would a live Sunday night Premier League fixture work? We explore the pros and cons.

The Premier League are exploring the possibility of introducing a Sunday night fixture

Advantages

1. Another live game means another one we can watch. The Premier League would ditch another Saturday 3pm kick-off, meaning we could watch the entire match live rather than wait all night until Match of the Day or Football First.

2. Sunday night fixtures are a regular in most of Europe's top leagues. This Sunday night, for example, Elche take on Sevilla in Spain's La Liga, Inter Milan face Napoli in Italy's Serie A and Montpellier host Lyon in France's Ligue 1. Instead of being left with a choice of continental action at 6pm on a Sunday night once Sky's Super Sunday finishes, why not have another Premier League game to watch?

BT Sport and Sky Sports paid the Premier League £3billion for the live rights from 2013-2016

3. The terrestrial television line-up on Sunday night is pretty weak. A live Premier League game on a Sunday night would mean not having to sit through the Antiques Roadshow, X Factor results show or Downton Abbey.

4. Selling another live game would mean even more money generated. The Premier League raked in more than £5billion from broadcasters around the world from 2013 to 2016 with £3bn of that coming from the UK. But the Premier League only sold 154 games from a total of 380 toSky Sports and BT Sport, with each game costing just shy of £20million. At that rate, an extra 38 live games (one every week) would generate another £760m.

5. The Premier League are looking at an extra game on a Sunday night - that means in addition to theSuper Sunday double bill we currently enjoy on Sky. Could you imagine how good a triple header of live Premier League action would be?

Disadvantages

1. It would create even more travel problems for supporters, who are already given little consideration. It's quite an effort to make your way home from the other side of the country after a midweek game, but the Sunday public transport service creates some logistical nightmares for fans.

2. Sunday is generally a day to be spent with the family. That time has already been shortened to the evening due to Super Sunday dominating the afternoon agenda. Surely fathers, husbands and boyfriends can't blag another 90 minutes in front of the television.

3. The international audience cannot be underestimated, especially in Asia. A match starting in the evening in England would take place in the early hours of the morning in places such as China and India. Spain's La Liga are making an effort to bring their kick-off times forward from the evening to the afternoon to compete with the Premier League in markets such as the Far East. In terms of the Asian audience, a Saturday 3pm kick-off makes much more sense than a Sunday evening fixture.

4. Managers of teams in the Champions League are forever asking for more help from the Premier League when it comes to fixture scheduling. Playing even later on a Sunday wouldn't please the likes of Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger, especially if they have a big European tie coming up that week.

5. Another live game on a Sunday would mean yet another one lost from the traditional Saturday 3pm slot, which used to be the centrepiece of the football weekend.
