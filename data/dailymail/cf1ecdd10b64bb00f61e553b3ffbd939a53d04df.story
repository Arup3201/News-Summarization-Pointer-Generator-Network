David Kalac handed himself over to police in Wilsonville, Oregon around 9pm, NBC News reports.

Gave up: Accused killer David Kalac handed himself over to police in Wilsonville, Oregon (he's pictured here after the arrest) around 9pm after an allegedly incriminating, and stomach-turning, post on 4Chan followed by a high speed chase 

Wanted: David Kalac, 33,  was charged Wednesday with killing Amber Lynn, right, who was found dead inside her home on Tuesday. Her son found her body after he returned home from school

Scene: She was found murdered inside her Port Orchard, Washington home, pictured, on Tuesday afternoon - just half an hour after the killer apparently posted grisly images of her naked body online

Police previously spotted Lynn's missing gold 2001 Ford Focus in Portland in the early hours of Wednesday and saw Kalac behind the wheel, KOMO reported.  

They tried to pull the driver over, but he sped away and led police on a high-speed chase before he was last seen swerving into oncoming traffic. 

The car was last seen speeding southbound on Barbur Boulevard in Portland and passing Taylors Ferry Road.

Authorities had a warrant out for his arrest for second-degree murder in the grisly killing in Kitsap County on Tuesday. 

On Tuesday, a 4chan user photographs just before 3pm apparently showing the woman's lifeless nude body on a bed with red marks around her neck. 

'Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours,' said a 4chan message, viewed by MailOnline. 'Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops.

'I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop.

'I understand the doubts. Just check the f***ing news. I have to lose my phone now.' 

Friends: Police have said that the killing did not appear to be random and that the victim had been targeted

Terrifying: Images that apparently show the woman's body were posted online and show her nude on a bed inside the home with red marks around her neck. Authorities are looking into the images

In another graphic message, the poster added that 'it's way harder' to kill someone 'than it looks in the movies' and described the struggle with the woman.

The woman's son returned home and found the body. He called police at 3.26pm. Time stamps on the images and posts show they were shared between 2.56pm and 3.06pm.

Created in 2003 by a 15-year-old high school student from New York City, Christopher Poole, 4Chan was originally meant to be a forum to discuss Japanese anime and post photos. The image board site soon grew to by much more, and quickly became one of the biggest websites in the world. 

The biggest difference between 4Chan and other websites however is that it allows commenters and contributors to post anonymously, giving many free reign to do things they would not do otherwise.

While this has led to the site producing some amusing and funny pranks, many are horrific and have led to the arrest of the person or persons who created them. 

LOLCats – The Internet obsession with cats actually began back in 2005 when one 4Chan commenter decided to post as a photo of a cat waiting for Caturday. It all took off from there.

Rickroll – In 2007, a fake link to the trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto IV was posted to the site after the website of the game’s publisher, Rockstar Games, crashed. Instead of seeing a look at the highly anticipated new game, eager fans were instead taken to the YouTube page for the Rick Astley music video “Never Gonna Give You Up.”

Steve Jobs Death – In 2008 members on the site spread a false rumor that Steve Jobs was dead, causing Apple stock prices to plummet a whopping 10% in one day.

Send Justin Bieber To North Korea – Justin Bieber has long been a target for the site, and in 2010 he wanted fans to tell him where they wanted him to go on his My World Tour. 4Chan users hacked his site, and the overwhelming winner was North Korea. The Canadian did not ultimately make the trip.

Jessi Slaughter – In what may have been their most vicious attack to date, members of 4Chan began to cyberbully an 11-year-old girl after claiming she was having a relationship with an older man. They posted her address, called her house, and spread false rumors and reports about her and her family. The threats got so bad that the young girl was put in police protection at one point. 

Trayvon Martin – In 2012 a 4Chan hacker and white supremacist falsely claimed they had hacked into Trayvon Martin’s email and Facebook accounts after his murder, posting emails and photos that were supposed to back up the false claim that Martin was a drug addict and dealer. 

Cutting For Bieber – In early 2013, a member of 4Chan created an elaborate Twitter hoax in which they urged fans of Justin Bieber to cut themselves so the pop star would stop smoking weed. Soon, the hashtags #cutforbieber and #cuttingforbieber amassed numerous photos of fans who claimed to have slashed their wrists and forearms over Bieber's drug use.   

Taylor Swift's Biggest Fan – In 2013 Taylor Swift, like Bieber, wanted fans to help her out with her next contest. She was looking for her biggest fan, and 4Chan made sure the winner was a 39-year-old man named Charles who wanted to ‘sniff Taylor’s hair.’ The contest was ultimately cancelled.

Celebrity Nude Leaks – Nothing 4Chan has done has had a bigger impact however than the leaking of hundreds of nude photos of celebrities in 2014, something that eventually led to the FBI getting involved. Victims included A-list stars like Jennifer Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Kim Kardashian and Rihanna.

Police are investigating the photos' connection to the case, the Kitsap Sun reported.  

Sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson confirmed that the photos appeared to have been posted anonymously on the image-sharing website just before 3pm.

He said officers take the photos seriously but 'we're unable to confirm whether those photographs are of this victim'.

KIRO reported that, following the 'suicide by cop' claim, extra officers were stationed around the crime scene for protection. 

Wilson said officers don't believe the killing was random and Lynn and Kalac's Facebook pages show they are friends on the website.

Have you seen this car? The woman's gold 2001 Ford Focus, like the file image above, is missing

'It's a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,' Wilson told the Kitsap Sun. 'This is not a random target of opportunity where somebody decided to kick in a door and kill somebody.'

Neighbors told Q13Fox that the woman and her son moved to the home just a few months ago. None saw or heard anything suspicious at the house. 

Sheriff's officers are still trying to locate the woman's missing car, a gold 2001 Ford Focus which has two doughnut spare tires on the back wheels. The Washington license is 495-YLY.   

Authorities are asking anyone who sees the woman's car or knows of its location to contact the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office on 911 or 360-308-5400.
