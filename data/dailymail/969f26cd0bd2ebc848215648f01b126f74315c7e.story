Rapid decline: Mother of one Sarah Tinay, 32, died within days of complaining about pain in her arm

A young mother died of a rare flesh-eating disease after a GP mistook her condition for a frozen shoulder.

Sarah Tinay, 32, died within days of complaining about the pain in her arm.

Her GP gave her painkillers but the discomfort got worse and a few days later her father, Ken Clark, took her to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

After a CT scan, she was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis, a condition in which bacteria starts killing healthy tissue.

If not caught quickly it leads to blood poisoning and multiple organ failure.

Mrs Tinay was immediately prepared for surgery but she died on the operating table.

Just before she went into theatre her father told her: ‘You will soon be back with your family.’

Mr Clark said: ‘I gave her a kiss and she smiled and I said, “Dad always knows best.” That was the last time we spoke.’

Mrs Tinay’s husband Paul, 39, who has been left to bring up the couple’s 16-month-old daughter Lauren alone, is refusing to blame the GP at Wellington House Practice in Princes Risborough who saw his wife.

IT salesman Mr Tinay believes the reason his wife succumbed to the disease will remain ‘a complete mystery’.

Necrotising fasciitis can be caused by common bacteria.  It normally breaks out only in people with weakened immune systems such as the frail.
