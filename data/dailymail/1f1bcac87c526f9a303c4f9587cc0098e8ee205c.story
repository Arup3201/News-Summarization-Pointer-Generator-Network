The sister of Welsh rugby legend and TV pundit Ieuan Evans leapt off a cliff and killed herself after being 'racked with guilt' over a lesbian affair.

Mother-of-two Non Thomas - younger sister of former Welsh captain and British Lions winger Ieuan - jumped 150ft after texting her husband, an inquest heard earlier today.

The 45-year-old sent a desperate final message: 'Please look after the children - they are the only thing I have got right.'

The coroner was told that former champion athlete and netball player Mrs Thomas had an affair with her gay lover Gail Mooney for several months.

But Mrs Thomas - a Professor of Health Science  - was 'in torment' about cheating on her husband.

She told her fire officer husband Roger that she felt terrible guilt about what she had done to her family.

He said: 'She was racked with guilt and ashamed of what she had done.

'She was distressed about what was happening and about her confused feelings.'

In another text message to him she said: 'I’m so sorry about everything, I feel so guilty of what I have done.'

Mrs Thomas met Miss Mooney while they both worked at Swansea University’s Health Science department.

Her husband realised she was in a gay relationship when he found articles on her computer relating to married women having gay lovers.

He said: 'I knew she was meeting Gail and she told me she was struggling with her sexuality.'

Miss Mooney told how their relationship had turned sexual - and how Mrs Thomas had poured out her feelings of love for her.

A note she wrote to her read: 'I’m in love with you - it’s a love I have never known.'

But in a separate note to her lover just
a few days before she died, Mrs Thomas said: 'I can’t cope any more - 
I’m crippled with guilt and guilt at breaking up my marriage, it’s killing me.”The alarm was raised by her husband after fearing she was suicidal after drinking heavily.

But Mrs Thomas plunged off a 150 feet high cliff near Bridgend, South Wales, seconds after a police helicopter landed on the top.

She suffered multiple injuries and was dead by the time rescuers reached her.

Mrs Thomas, who was living in the family home in Sketty, Swansea, had two daughters aged 7 and 9.

Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell said: “Her sexuality was a huge conflict for her.“She had thoughts that she had always been gay but didn’t want to hurt her husband or children.”

Winger Ieuan played for Wales 72 times, 28 as captain - a joint record.

He was also picked to turn out for the British Lions team on seven occasions.

He scored 33 tries for Wales, making him the third most prolific scorer for his country and played for club sides Llanelli and Bath.

Ieuan, now a rugby pundit for Sky TV, was awarded an MBE for services to rugby in 1996, and retired from the game in 1999.
