The Catalina Island Museum has opened an exhibit dedicated to a notorious Native American grave robber who presided over an 'Indian museum' built out of the bones he recovered from the burial grounds.

'The Strange and Mysterious Case of Dr. Glidden' delves into the colorful and mysterious past of amateur archaeologist Ralph Glidden - hoping to shed light on a gruesome period in the Californian islands history.

The no-holds-barred exhibit features an introduction that says he, through his unscientific plundering, disregarded 'the sanctity of human remains' and inflicted 'near-permanent damage' on research into local Native American life.

Laying out what visitors can expect, the museum's Executive Director Michael De Marsche compared the exhibition to those at Holocaust museum's in Europe saying they explore, 'similar issues: the genocide of a people, the desecration of their graves and the lack of respect for the sacredness of their remains.'

The 'disturbing and troubling exhibition' was put together after museum curator discovered boxes of Glidden's journals, letters and photographs that document how he went about his dubious methods.

Throughout the early part of the last century up until the 1930s, the self-proclaimed professor was hired by a foundation to excavate Native American graves.

He dug up hundreds and obtained thousands of objects, many of which went to prestigious museums. They included bone flutes, war clubs and arrowheads, cooking stones used to boil soup in baskets and beads that were used as currency.

He also built an island museum that incorporated Native American bones as architectural elements, including windows edged with finger and toe bones, leg and arm bones as shelf brackets and ceiling panels decorated with vertebra and shoulder blades.

His macabre makeshift exhibition tent was described by Glidden himself as 'unlike anything else anywhere in this country'.

He modeled the interior on a mortuary chapel on the Mediterranean island of Malta which had walls created from the bones of monks.

The Catalina Islander said that his museum displayed rows of human skulls and femur bones were deployed as shelving supports.

Windows were decorated with bones from Native American fingers and feet and Glidden happily posed for photographs inside his decrepit museum.

Calling himself 'Dr', despite there being no evidence he even graduated from high school, Glidden is thought to have rifled through 801 grave-sites from 105 individual locations around Catalina Island.

His methods allowed him to accumulate one of the largest collection of human remains and artifacts of the native peoples of Catalina Island and by the 1920s he was enjoying fame and fortune, dining with the nation's wealthiest men.

Shrewdly using the media to promote his own aims, Glidden hired an ex-Los Angeles Times journalist to become his personal publicist, transforming himself into 'the famous archaelogist Ralph Glidden'- complete with funding from oil baron George Gustav Heye.

His finds made their way across the United States to prestigious institutions and he made fantastical claims to have unearthed a mythical prehistoric race of blue-eyed, giant Native Americans.

Indeed, in 1930, he announced the discovery of a skeleton of a 'royal princess' surrounded by the skeletons of 64 children buried in four tiers and five feet below the children was the skeleton of a 7 feet, 8 inch tall man.

No photographic proof of this was ever provided.

Just three years after initiating his first dig, Glidden sold his entire collection to the prestigious Heye Foundation of the Museum of the American Indian in New York owned by Gustav Heye (right)

The exhibit on Ralph Glidden that opened over the weekend at Catalina 
Island Museum features an introduction that says he, through his 
unscientific plundering, disregarded 'the sanctity of human remains' and
 inflicted 'near-permanent damage' on research into local Native 
American life.

In the 1920s and 30s, the self-proclaimed professor was hired by a foundation to excavate Native American graves. He dug up hundreds and obtained thousands of objects, many of which went to prestigious museums

Born in 1880 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Glidden moved to Catalina in 1896 with his parents and was working as a carpenter in 1915 when he first began excavating Native American graves.

Political sensitivities and the law were not against his actions at the time and within a short time he had amassed a collection that the Los Angeles Times said 'would make any curator in this nation envious.'

By 1918 he had entered into his partnership with German-American Heye and sold his loot to his Foundation of the Museum of the American Indian in New York.

In 1922, the Heye Foundation suddenly reduced its funding to Glidden and in April of 1924 cut all money for excavation of the islands burial sites.

His only source of income was his grizzly museum of human bones that overlooked Avalon's harbor.

A fresh interest in archaeology provided by Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen in 1923 gave Glidden a boost - leading to him spinning his wondrous yarns about giants and princesses found on the small Pacific island off the coast of California.

He also built an island museum that incorporated Native American bones as architectural elements, including windows edged with finger and toe bones, leg and arm bones as shelf brackets and ceiling panels decorated with vertebra and shoulder blades

Media interest descended and articles by The New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Chicago Tribune all showed up the 'Dr's' empty boasts.

By the early 1930s he was almost bankrupt and began touting a tale of a 'secret history' of the island which he refused to give up until he was paid.

The price included the remnants of his collection and for 30-years he unsuccessfully tried to shop the history and his artifacts around.

In 1962 he was paid $5,000 for the collection, but not the history. Hundreds of skulls and bones and thousands of teeth were moved to the University of California, Los Angeles.

After his death in 1968, the secret was revealed to be less than 10 pages of text.

Jeanne Hill, 89, of Avalon recalled hiking up a hill to the museum in the 1930s and paying 35 cents to get inside.

'It was scary, very scary,' Hill told the LA Times.

'Bones piled up all over the place. One skull had a light on in it.'
