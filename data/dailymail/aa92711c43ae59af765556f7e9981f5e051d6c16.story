The St Paul’s protest camp has become a ‘magnet’ for criminals, alcoholics and drug addicts, the High Court heard yesterday.

The churchyard where anti-capitalist demonstrators have pitched 200 tents is also unsanitary and stinking, it was alleged.

The claims were made as the City of London Corporation started legal action to evict the Occupy London protest which has been in the cathedral grounds since October 16.

David Forsdick, representing the Corporation, said: ‘The protest camp has acted as a magnet for people who have caused significant disorder and a substantial increase in crime in this area.’

Social workers are concerned about the mentally ill, alcoholics and drug addicts who have been attracted to the camp, the court heard.

On sanitation, Mr Forsdick said foul water and ‘other debris’ was being flushed down rainwater drains. He added: ‘There is an odour problem.’

The camp is damaging businesses near the cathedral and impairing worship, he said.

And while the Corporation had not been able to establish how many tents were occupied at night, all the evidence suggested that a large number of protesters were ‘day visitors only’.

The City and the court could not lawfully tolerate a position in which the rights of worshippers were seriously affected on an ongoing basis, Mr Forsdick said.

He also said the rights of staff and clergy to go about their day-to-day business without unacceptable behaviour towards them were seriously impaired, and there was a substantial overall impact on trade in the area.

The location was also unsuitable for such a major protest camp because of the disposal of waste and cleansing issues, he added.

While many of the protesters were making efforts to try to ensure that it was kept clean, sanitary and hygienic, urination and defecation were significant problems, Mr Forsdick said.

The City had also been concerned about the wellbeing of those suffering from mental illness, alcoholism or drug addiction who had been attracted to the camp, he said.

The evidence from many witnesses was of chaotic and vulnerable people causing significant disorder at the camp, the court heard.

'This is a threat to them and to others,' Mr Forsdick said during the proceedings, which are due to last for four days.

But in an act of defiance as the legal bid to evict them gets under way, Occupy London protesters are planning a two-week party.

The demonstrators say they will be welcoming revellers, particularly the homeless, to join them.

And they will be offering live music and free food - including turkey on Christmas Day, the Times reports.

However, the festivities could be seen as a parting gesture from the protesters.

As the likelihood grows that the protesters will be evicted, it is believed the camp leaders are discussing proposals to reduce their presence on the steps of St Paul's. Currently around 150 people are in the camp, which has been there for 60 days.

A source from within the group told The Independent there was 'widespread consensus' that the time has come to end the main demonstration, although they are considering leaving behind a scaled-down presence.

But the decision by protest leaders to move on before they are forced to go is seen as a chance for them to retain goodwill at the end of a saga that has split the Church of England.

It is thought that a compromise would also allow the Church to save face after a protest which saw the cathedral close its doors for the first time since the Blitz and forced the resignation of Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser.

Giles Fraser's resignation as canon chancellor was seen as legitimising the protest

His decision, after a vote for a legal challenge that would have had protesters forcibly removed, was seen as legitimising the occupation.

The camp source said: 'There is widespread consensus that resources at the camp are stretched, and concerns about the long-term viability of the site. We are looking at restructuring and how best to use our other sites.'

Mr Forsdick said: 'The City is not bringing these claims to protect the banks, nor is it bringing them to prevent peaceable protest against the financial sector. Nor is it bringing these claims to stifle freedom of speech.

'It is bringing these claims solely to remove the semi-permanent protest camp because, after very careful consideration, it has concluded it is necessary to do so.

'It is a pressing social need in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others.'

Proceedings were launched after protesters, who began the camp on October 16, ignored a November 17 deadline to clear the 'public highway' and tore down eviction notices from their tents - some of which are pitched on the footpath next to shops surrounding the cathedral, with the rest in the churchyard.

The corporation, the local authority which runs the Square Mile, has expressed concern over 'worrying trends' at the camp, including late-night drinking, and the fact that companies near the cathedral have complained about losing business.

Camp occupants are expected to vote on the decision to move on within the next few days, but in the meantime it is party mood.

One protester, retired chiropodist Richard Trevan, 55, told The Times: 'We are going to have a party, and throw it open to the homeless, to everyone.

'The next phase is actually to make this camp more mellow...but at Christmas it'll be inspirational; one big family celebrating.'

In papers submitted to Mr Justice Lindblom, Michael Paget, for the defendants, said their views were genuinely held on an issue of ‘extreme public importance’.

The hearing continues.
