'Chaos and confusion': The figures were obtained

costly shake up of the NHS

NHS spending on management consultants has risen three-fold in a year.

In the past six months, £40million has been paid out by various health service organisations, compared to £15million for the whole of last year.

This includes £17.6million paid out by 211 new GP-led organisations called Clinical Commissioning Groups who decide how to spend local NHS budgets.

And another £10million was spent by 18 new quangos called Clinical Support Units who advise these GP organisations on what treatments and services to buy.

The hospital watchdog Monitor paid out £8.5million, while NHS England – the body in charge of running the health service – spent £1.8million.

Labour MP Liz Kendall, who obtained the figures, blamed the Government’s costly shake-up of the NHS.

Last April, ministers scrapped hundreds of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities and replaced them with CCGs in the hope of cutting management and bureaucracy.

Mrs Kendall said: ‘Patients left waiting hours in A&E, and hard-pressed taxpayers who are struggling to make ends meet, will be rightly furious at the huge increase in spending on management consultants.

‘David Cameron’s backroom NHS reorganisation has caused utter chaos and confusion. All these new bodies are now desperately trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing, and paying millions of pounds to management consultants to advise them.’

Figures also show that the NHS spent £1.4billion in redundancy payments during the shake-up.

Only last month it emerged that 3,200 
bureaucrats had been given pay-offs, only to walk into new jobs within 
the health service. They include a husband-and-wife team who took 
£1million in redundancies.

Karen Straughair, 50, was paid £605,000 at the end of March when NHS South of Tyne and Wear was abolished.

Her husband Chris Reed, 57, was handed £345,000 when NHS North of Tyne was axed.

In June, Mr Reed was made chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals, while his wife was appointed recovery director.
