Not something to snirtle about: Author Safia Shah is campaigning to preserve endangered words before they are lost from the English language forever

A children's author has launched a campaign to save old-fashioned words like begrumpled, ninnyhammer and slubberdegullion before they disappear from the English language for good.

Former journalist Safia Shah has published a book called Around The World In 80 Years which she hopes will breathe new life into obscure phrases and adjectives.

Many of the words - which also include terms like snirtle, fratchy and jargogle - were compiled after she invited people to come up with suggestions for the book.

She told The Times: 'Some are old-fashioned and have gone out of usage, others are family words that had been handed down from generation to generation and people weren't sure if they were proper words.'

Mrs Shah, who has worked with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, said some wonderfully colourful words are in danger of being lost forever.

Around The World In 80 Years aims to help children move away from texting and tweets and instead explore the spoken word.

In the introduction, she says: 'Let's snatch begrumpled from the brink of obscurity... We want to open our wink-a-peeps and champion their cause.'

She also commissioned 20 women to make her a woollen 'cosy' for the old London taxi that she drives featuring some of her favourite words.

The project took four months and 20kg of wool.

Colourful campaign: Mrs Shah has published Around The World In 80 Years which features a number of endangered words including blatteroon, slubberdegullion and jargogle

Begrumpled - sad

Blatteroon - a senseless boaster

Fratchy - irritable

Jargogle - to confuse or jumble

Kedge-belly - a bulging stomach

Ninnyhammer - a fool

Ramfeezled - exhausted

Snirtle - to laugh in snorts

Slubberdegullion - a scoundrel

Wink-a-peeps - eyes

The English Language passed the one-million word mark in 2009, according to the Global Language Monitor.

But Mrs Shah says most people only need around 7,000 to get through everyday life.

Conversely, researchers earlier this year ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago.

Linguists at the University of Lancaster used computers to trawl through millions of books, speeches, studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation.

They found 'marriage', ‘childhood’, ‘God’ and ‘religion’ all fell in popularity but ‘Christmas’ was on the up.

And although ‘modesty,’ ‘conscience’ and ‘gentleman’ are no longer in vogue, ‘sex’ and ‘celebrity’ are far more common.
