Thousands of Christmas Day revellers lined a rainy seafront as people in fancy dress took the plunge for a freezing dip in the sea.

The brave participants launched themselves into the sea in Exmouth, Devon for the annual swim.

Among some of the unusual outfits on display were people dressed as whoopie cushions, a man in a Borat-style mankini and groups of Santa's, elves and snowflakes.Â 

The swimmers dashed across the beach before jumping into the sea in the tradition which began in the late 1960s.
