The idea may be enough to put some people off their lunch, but one savvy entrepreneur has decided to convert a Victorian men’s public toilet into a fashionable new café.

The Attendant Café, on Foley Street, West London, has been thoroughly cleaned and refurbished to make it comfortable for customers to eat in.

The café, which opened on February 18, still features the original Doulton & Co 1890s porcelain urinals which have been converted into individual booths for people to sit at.

The cafe owners aim to provide the best food with a chef from the Michelin star Pollen Street Social

The refurbishment of the disused public toilet cost owner peter Tomlinson £100,000 to pull off.The entrepreneur came up with the idea and defends the café’s hygiene.

He told the BBC: ‘Everything has been jet washed and the soil stacks have been concreted and capped.

‘It smells beautiful down here now.’

The cast iron exterior provides the perfect entrance to the cafe with its attractive detailing

Peter Tomlinson and his business partner Ben Russell saw potential in the scruffy exterior to the public toilet

Customers are treated to gourmet sandwiches by a chef who previously worked at Michelin-star restaurant Pollen Street Social.

The cafe aims to give the best quility food with their meticulously sourced produce including coffee beans from Kings Cross' Caravan 
Roastery, and milk from one of the 120 cows at the Ivy House Farm in 
Somerset.

The cast-iron exterior of the property is set to attract attention but the interior makes the most striking impact.

The original porcelain urinals are now being used as booths for individuals to eat their gourmet sandwiches in

While the detailing is still there, the cafe has come a long way during its £100,000 refurbishment

Mr Tomlinson spent almost all of his savings after spotting the property while out drinking with a friend

The attendant’s office has been converted into a kitchen and urinals are now table tops.

Mr Tomlinson took redundancy from his marketing job and invested most of his savings into the café.

He and his business partner Ben Russell found the spot as they were drinking outside of a pub nearby.

The business partners have sourced the best produce that they could find to ensure that customers are given the highest quality food

The idea takes advantage of London’s cheaper commercial spaces, allowing the owner to avoid the capital’s rising property prices.

It is open from 7.30am till 17.30pm Monday to Friday.
