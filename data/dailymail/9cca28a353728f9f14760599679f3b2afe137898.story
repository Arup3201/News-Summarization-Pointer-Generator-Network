Health scare: Michael Clarke Duncan, pictured here with girlfriend Omarosa Stallworth last year, is in hospital following a heart attack

Fehily would not confirm a TMZ 
report that Duncan's actress-girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, 
discovered the former bodyguard in distress at about 2am Friday in 
his Los Angeles area home.

The website reports Omarosa revived Duncan by performing CPR.Â 

The former The Apprentice star, who has been dating the actor since 2010, is understood to be by his bedside in an intensive care unit.

Her representative Priscilla Clarke 
confirmed Duncan was hospitalised today but did not provide any further 
details regarding his condition or how he was found.

Kent Moran, who directed Duncan in The
Challenger, tells MailOnline the actor recently wrapped scenes on the action drama, in which he stars as a trainer helping to revive the 
career of boxer Jaden Miller.

Duncan co-starred with Tom Hanks, and David Morse in Frank Darabont's 1999 crime drama The Green Mile

Moran, who also stars as Miller in the film, described Duncan as 'very healthy' on set and said he coped well with the physicality of the role, adding that news of the actor falling ill was 'unexpected'.

Moran added: 'We were very surprised and saddened to here the news. Our film 
is now in post production and we have finished filming Michael's scenes.
So at this point, we are really just praying for him and wishing him a 
speedy recovery.'

Duncan's co-star from The Finder, Geoff Stults, visited the actor in hospital today and said he is recovering well.

Stults told TMZ: 'I saw him ... he's looking good ... thats all we know right now.'

Duncan meanwhile hinted at his health issues in a public service announcement released by People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) in May.

The PSA, which promotes vegetarianism as a means to prevent heart disease and stroke, features Duncan saying he was plagued with several illnesses before making the dietary change approximately three years ago.

He does not elaborate on his health problems in the clip.

The actor says watching film Meet Your Meet, about the process of animal protein production, helped him to decide to stop eating meat.

'I never knew what the process was from that animal to my plate,' he says.

'Once I looked at an animal like that I cleared out my refrigerator of about $5,000 worth of meat.'

Duncan catapulted to fame after his role in 1999 prison drama The Green Mile. He is also well-known for his roles in the 2003 comic book movie Daredevil and 2005 release Sin City.

He is currently starring in TV drama The Finder.
