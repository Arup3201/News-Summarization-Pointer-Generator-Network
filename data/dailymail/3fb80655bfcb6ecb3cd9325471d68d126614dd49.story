Michael Miller, who faces 10 years in jail for assaulting a homeless man he invited into his house and had a threesome with his wife with

An ex-marine faces up to 10 years in jail after assaulting a homeless man he had invited into his home to have a threesome with his wife.

Martin Miller, 30, and his wife Daniela, 24, had brought homeless 20-year-old Michael Chaney into their house and had a threesome with him, before things took a nasty turn.

Mrs Miller and the homeless man continued to stay intimate for three days after the threesome without Mr Miller's knowledge, a Bay City, Michigan court heard - and things blew up when Mr Chaney offered to cook hamburgers for them all.

The married couple were in the bathroom, with Mrs Miller in the tub, when Mr Chaney brought up some burger meat for them to taste.

Mr Miller tossed the meat into the bath - and did the same again when his guest returned with more.

Mr Chaney told him to stop wasting food and left the room, so Mr Miller followed him and told him he would beat him up.

Mr Chaney told him to go ahead. Mr Miller then kicked him in the chest, pushed his wife away and then choked him, telling him he was going to kill him, court records say.

He blacked out, and when he awoke, Mrs Miller walked him to the hospital, the homeless victim told the court.

'Martin became jealous after we had a threesome because Daniela started to distance herself from him,' said Mr Chaney, as reported by mlive.com. 

In his defence, Mr Miller said: 'I am a marine. When someone challenges me I go into kill mode,' while adding that Mr Chaney was being an 'a**hole'.

The catalyst: Michael Chaney was cooking burgers for the Millers, and brought some of the meat up to the bathroom where they were for them to taste. Mr Miller then threw it in the bath and attacked him

He claims that he could not remember if he had kicked Mr Chaney and admitted to strangling him, but said throwing the burger meat in the bath was a joke.

He has been charged with one count of assault by strangulation, and could go to prison for up to 10 years and be fined $5,000 if found guilty. 

Police were sent to the McLaren Bay Region hospital emergency room, near to the Millers' Bay City home, at about 11.44pm last Friday.

There, Mr Chaney told officers he had been living with the Millers for about a week before the attack, and that Mr Miller became jealous of him after their threesome.

Mrs Millers backed up Mr Chaney's description of the events, while Mr Miller also confirmed many of them.

He said that Mr Chaney called his bluff when he had threatened to beat him up, and questioned his wife as to why she had taken the homeless man's side. Polce then arrested him.

At court on Monday, Mr Miller told Bay County Chief District Judge Timothy Kelly that he had served in the U.S. Marine Corps between 2002 and 2005, before receiving honourable discharge.

He suffers from bipolar disorder, and now receives social security income.
