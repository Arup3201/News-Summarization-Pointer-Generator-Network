School run road rage between two mothers ended in violence when one attacked her rival’s vehicle with a car jack.

Rachael Harding, 33, and Charmaine Smith parked their cars facing one other after dropping off their children at St Kentigern’s school in Fallowfield, Manchester.

Because of the parked cars on either side of the road, neither was able to get past unless one of them agreed to back down and reverse.

School gates: Harding and Mrs Smith had dropped their children at St Kentigern's school in Manchester but both refused to reverse after they parked their cars facing one another - but both refused to reverse

After a brief stand-off, Harding lost her temper and began mouthing obscenities from the driver’s seat, Manchester magistrates court heard.

She eventually got out of her car armed with the jack and struck Mrs Smith’s car twice, denting the bonnet both times.

Harding then went to the driver’s window and lashed out again, causing minor damage. When the traffic cleared, Harding drove away but stopped briefly and spat on Mrs Smith’s windscreen and warned her ‘I’ll ******* get you’ and ‘I’m going to **** you up’.

When police investigated the incident on Bethnall Drive, officers attempted to resolve it using the restorative justice process.

However, this proved impossible when Harding refused to admit her role in the argument.

And when the case came to court, she did not turn up for the hearing and was convicted in her absence of causing criminal damage and threatening behaviour.

Court: When the case came to court, Harding did not turn up for the hearing and was
convicted in her absence of causing criminal damage and threatening 
behaviour. She has to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work

Harding, of Fallowfield, turned up to be sentenced and was ordered to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work, pay £200 compensation for the car damage and another £50 for the stress caused to Mrs Smith, who was not charged in relation to the incident.

Magistrates told Harding: 'These are very serious charges and you could have ended up in custody.'

From the dock, Harding still continued to maintain her innocence and said she would appeal against the sentence.

She added: 'I feel I have been treated in an unfair and unjust way.'

Harding was unavailable for comment after the case.
