Friday night football is coming to the Premier League, Sportsmail can reveal, with the league's governing body making the shock decision to put Friday matches up for sale for the first time.

Tender documents for live UK rights to England's top division have been made available to interested broadcasters from Friday - firing the starting pistol on what is sure to be a hotly contested and massively lucrative battle for rights between 2016 and 2019.

The announcement also means that more Premier League football will be shown live on TV than ever before from the 2016-17 season.

Champions Manchester City are set for Premier League games on a Friday night under a new rights package

- 168 matches will be available to be shown live from 2016 - 14 more than currently.

- Up to 10 of those matches will be shown live on Friday evenings.

- The 168 games will be split into seven packages - five of 28 matches and two packages of 14 matches. No single buyer will be allowed to acquire more than five packages or 126 matches.

- The ITT will include an auction for a free-to-air highlights package, held by the BBC's Match of the Day since 2004.

- The current total value of the domestic broadcast rights deals is £3.018billion over three years.

- An announcement on the 2016-19 rights is expected by early March.

- A later auction will take place for 212 'near-live' matches to be accessed on-demand, and for internet-based clips.

- The ITT will protect the Saturday 3pm 'closed period' where games kicking off then are not shown live.

From August 2016 broadcasters will be able to show 168 games live, a huge 44 per cent of all top flight matches throughout the season.

The announcement is an increase from the current deal, which allows 154 matches per year, and ran from the beginning of last season.

Under the new offer no single broadcaster will be able to show more than 126 of the live matches, with at least two of the seven packages of games to be shown on other channels.

The deals are expected to be completed in February, but the Invitation to Tender (ITT) opens the way for broadcasters to begin planning their bids.

The last deal, worth a total of £3.018billion was split between Sky, who won five packages - making up 116 games - and BT, who bought the remaining two packages totalling 38 games. 

Sky paid £2.28bn for their current 116 games per season, or in other words, got 348 games at £6,551,724 each. 

BT paid £738m for their current 38 games per season, or in other words, got 114 games at £6,473,684 each. 

The billion-dollar question is how much they will both be prepared to spend to keep or increase the games they have in 2016-19. 

Sky Sports have the rights to 116 games this season, and that number could go up with the new deal

The appeal of stars like Wayne Rooney have made live Premier League matches attractive for broadcasters

Sergio Aguero, November's Premier League player of the month, could now be scoring goals on a Friday

BT Sport caused a shock with the previous deal when they paid almost £6.5m per game in 2013

There will still be a restriction on showing any live football beginning at 3pm on a Saturday, but the increase in available matches means there will be a decline in the number of games 

The Premier League have also opened the market for it's free-to-air highlights package, currently held by the BBC in the form of Match of the Day.

It is thought that ITV, who held the rights between 2001 and 2004 with their show The Premiership, are considering bidding for the contract.
