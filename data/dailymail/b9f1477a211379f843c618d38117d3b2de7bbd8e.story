Doing overtime increases the risk of heart  disease by up to 80 per cent, a major study has claimed.

Researchers say long working hours could be condemning thousands of employees to heart attacks and strokes.

The warning follows analysis of 12 studies dating back as far as 1958, involving a total of 22,000 people from around the world.

Time for a holiday: Research shows that employees who frequently put in overtime significantly increase their risk of heart attacks and strokes

The analysis, by scientists at the 
Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, found that those whose working
 days that were longer than the traditional eight hours had a 40 to 80 
per cent greater chance of heart disease.

The size of the increase varied depending on how each study was carried out.

The effects were more pronounced when 
participants were asked how long they worked for – but when researchers 
closely monitored working hours, the increased risk of heart disease was
 closer to 40 per cent.

Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen 
said the effects could be due to 'prolonged exposure to stress'. Other 
triggers could be poor eating habits and lack of exercise due to 
restricted leisure time.

In 2009, the same team discovered 
that long working hours increased the risk of dementia later in life. 
The effect was similar in magnitude to that of smoking.

Calm down: Prolonged exposure to psychological stress, which can occur at work, may be one reason for the link between longer hours and heart disease

Middle-aged workers putting in 55 
hours or more a week had poorer brain function than those clocking up no
 more than 40 hours, with lower scores on tests to measure intelligence,
 short-term memory and word recall.

Britons work some of the longest hours
 in Europe, with full-time employees averaging 42.7 a week. Those in 
Germany typically work for 42, while Danes do 39.1.

It estimated that more than five million people a year in Britain work unpaid extra hours to hang on to their jobs.

But the long-term toll on workers’ health could be devastating, the new research suggests.

In a report on the findings Dr Virtanen said: ‘There are several potential mechanisms that may underlie the association between long working hours and heart disease.

In addition to prolonged exposure to psychological stress she said other triggers could be raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol, poor eating habits and lack of physical activity due to restricted leisure time.
