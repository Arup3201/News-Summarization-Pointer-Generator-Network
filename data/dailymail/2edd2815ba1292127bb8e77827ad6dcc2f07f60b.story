Anne Wojciki, the estranged wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, says her genetic testing startup 23andMe will continue to operate despite being ordered to stop providing its most popular service - health-related DNA tests - after being pursued by the Food and Drug Administration.

On November 22, the FDA demanded the company stop marketing its DNA testing device, which uses a person's saliva to gather ancestry data and determine whether they are prone to certain medical conditions.

At issue is the fact the device is used to diagnose diseases, but 23andME do not have government approval to give out such information.

The agency warned that erroneous results could cause customers to seek unnecessary or ineffective medical care.

The FDA dispute follows a $5 million class action lawsuit filed by a customer, who claimed its ads are misleading and that the results are not supported by scientific evidence.

Sergey Brin - who founded Google with Larry Page - and wife Anne Wojcicki - CEO of genetic testing company 23andMe - confirmed they had separated in August. Wojcicki has said her startup will continue to operate despite a government order to stop its most popular service, DNA-tested health results showing whether people are prone to certain diseases

California start up 23andMe uses a saliva sample to DNA test people for ancestry information and whether they are prone to over 250 diseases and health conditions. However the FDA say they do not have government approval to give out such medical information

23andMe customers receive a tube in the mail which they returned to the company with a saliva sample.

For $99, they receive back DNA test results detailing their ancestry and whether or not they are at risk to more than 250 diseases and health conditions.

23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki says her company is now complying with FDA requirements

Founded by Wojcicki in 2006 - along with Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza, who have both now left the company - 23andMe has for years walked a fine line with the FDA, because it sits on the border of giving scientific information and providing a medical test.

Both sides have struggled to determine how the company should be regulated.

Now, in order to comply with the FDA but keep the company running, 23andMe say customers will still be able to download their own raw data, but it will be 'without interpretation'.

'We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our long-term mission to help people everywhere have access to their own genetic data and have the ability to use that information to improve their lives,' Wojcicki said in a statement.

'Our goal is to work cooperatively with the FDA to provide that opportunity in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefit to people and the validity of the science that underlies the test.

'The company will continue to provide consumers both ancestry-related information and raw genetic data without interpretation.

'In addition, the company will continue to conduct research using its database of genetic and phenotypic data, and also will continue its educational efforts.'

In a letter published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg insisted that regulatory review of 23andMe is necessary, but that the agency saw value in 23andMe's approach.

'We agree that access to tests through a direct-to-consumer model will allow consumers to take a more active role in certain aspects of their health,' she wrote.

'The agencyâ€™s desire to review these particular tests is solely to ensure that they are safe, do what they claim to do and that the results are communicated in a way that a consumer can understand.'

23andMe is based in Mountain View, Calif.

For $99, customers send back a spit kit to 23andMe containing a saliva sample (pictured) which is used for a genetics test. The company will continue to provide customers with the 'raw data' of their test results, however it will be 'without interpretation'

In August it was reported Wojcicki and Brin, one of Sillicon Valley's highest-profile couple, were living apart.

A spokesman for Brin and Wojcicki confirmed that 'they have been living apart for several months'

'They remain good friends and partners,' the spokesman said.

Brin and Wojcicki, both 40 years old, had been married for six years and have two children.

They are not yet legally separated.

23andMe was underwritten by a $3.9 million investment from Google in 2006, along with Genentech, New Enterprise Associates and Mohr Davidow Ventures.

Brin has separately invested in the company over the years as well.
