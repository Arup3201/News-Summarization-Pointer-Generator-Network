From racism and gay slurs to sexual harassment and X-rated revelations, the current series of Celebrity Big Brother is shaping up to be the most offensive yet.

Now with rumours that Katie Price's love rival - Jane Pountney, the former best friend who slept with her husband Kieran Hayler - is joining the house, it's clear the reality show's bosses are intent on creating a programme that is nothing less than explosive.

But experts say that no matter how badly the contestants behave viewers keep tuning in because it makes 'us feel better about ourselves'.

Blogger Perez Hilton has become one of the dominant figures in the house clashing with Katie Hopkins daily 

Shock queen Katie Price has over-shared about her past husbands, exes and their sexual proclivities

Calum Best has been seen getting close to Cami Li but Perez Hilton has described it as a 'showmance'

The past week has included a litany of insults and abuse. 

Perez Hilton accused his in-house tormentor Katie Hopkins of being homophobic after she told him to 'man up.'

Katie  Price has mooned at the camera, talked about sex toys and anal sex and how one partner gave her cystitis.

She's blasted her ex-husband Alex Reid for his alleged sexual proclivities and referred to another ex, Danny Cipriani, as having a small penis in conversations with her fellow housemates.  

Her headline-grabbing stories follow early exits from three other housemates.

Coronation Street actor Ken Morley, 71, famous for playing Reg Holdsworth in the soap, made regular mention of the female housemates' bodies and was eventually removed after he used the word, 'negro,' twice in reference to soul singer Alexander O'Neal.

Ken Morley was the first to leave the Big Brother house, he was accused of racism, sexism and misogyny

Communications watchdog Ofcom said that they had a total of 1,605 complaints in total about the show and 233 about Ken's language.

They have had 708 complaints about the treatment of Perez Hilton and 90 about former model Alicia Douvall being bullied.

Some of the housemates had called her 'stupid,' and Katie Hopkins said that if all the world was filled with people like Alicia it would be a worse place.

The complaints are currently under assessment and Ofcom have not yet decided whether they will launch any formal investigations.

In the 2007 series of Big Brother the late Jade Goody and her fellow housemates Jo O'Meara and Danielle O'Heara were accused of bullying and racially abusing Shilpa Shetty

Yet the housemates' behaviour degenerated further as after drinking too much, Baywatch actor Jeremy Jackson went to the toilet to be sick, where Chloe Goodman, wearing a dressing gown, followed him to help. He then pulled open her dressing gown to reveal her bare breast.

Jackson dismissed the incident as a case of 'curiosity killed the cat' and was ejected from the show.  

Hertfordshire Police, which covers the area where the show is filmed, confirmed at the time that they were investigating the situation, however, Chloe later decided not to press charges.  

Meanwhile, Alexander, 61, who had hits in the Eighties with Criticize and Saturday Love, made the statement: 'I hoped there were no Arabs in the house,' despite having claimed to, 'hate', racism.

And a series of furious bust-ups between Perez and Alexander saw the singer walk out claiming he had to remove himself from the house because he was fearful of what he may do - but not before he used an offensive gay slur to describe the US blogger.

Alexander O'Neal left the house over clashes with Perez Hilton and he was also accused of racism

While Celebrity Big Brother producers usually rub their hands with glee at the antics on the show, they can only be dismayed by the degree to which the housemates have insulted each other on the basis of gender, race and orientation.

Experts say the endless rows and clashes are a result of  the particular combination of strong personalities this year, as each housemate struggles for dominance.

Behavioral psychologist Marisa Peer says that part of the reason the stars are acting out so much is because they know it will garner them a huge deal of attention. 

She said: 'The housemates will 100 per cent exaggerate their characters from the outside world. Nice people simply are not entertaining and they know that. 

'We watch the shows for the fights and that’s what we remember about them.'

In the outside world Katie Hopkins is known for her acerbic ways and in the house she has been fighting with her fellow housemtes, especially Perez Hilton

She said: 'This series is the first series where there have been a lot of very similar characters, they all have this need to be in control.

'Usually there are only one or two people with those strong characters and then you have the slightly crazier periphery characters. 

'But this year you have Perez, Katie Hopkins, Nadia Sawalha and Michelle Visage all competing for top dog spot and they’re all people who are used to being in control.'

And the sight of these adults clashing and bickering childishly has a positive effect on the viewers,. Marisa said.

Katie Price has shocked both her fellow housemates and audiences alike talking about her ex-boyfriends

The two Katies - Price and Hopkins - have been determined to shock during their time on the Channel 5 show

'Watching it makes us feel better about ourselves, we think – I would never do that, I would never behave in that way. 

'Plus it's a show you can watch with all your family, although you think the behaviour can be awful it gives you something to talk about and discuss.' 

And although there may not have been as many official complaints about this series as the 2007 series in which Jade Goody and Jo Meara bullied Shilpa Shetty, this is down to the different ways we vent our anger in the era of social media.

Some 44,500 people complained to Ofcom during Celebrity Big Brother 5, but there were more than 24,000 tweets about Ken Morley and more than 100,000 about Jeremy Jackson.

In the first few days of Katie Price's inclusion in the house, 300,000 tweets circulated online about her antics. 

Neil Peplow, COO at the MET film school, said our reactions to this series of CBB has been magnified by our use of smartphones and tablets. 

He said: 'People are no longer looking at just one screen on their sofas at home. While watching traditional TV we are on Facebook, Twitter and the internet at the same time.

'Outrageous reality TV like CBB draws that attention back to the the big screen because people want to share their outrage within a community. It's the digital version of a water cooler.'  

And with hard-line chat-show host Jeremy Kyle widely reported to be entering the house we can only imagine that the show is set to get more controversial in the days to come.  

This isn't the first year that all hell has broken loose in the Celebrity Big Brother house... 

2007: Big Brother 5 was a series that will go down in history. The late Jade Goody, S Club 7 singer Jo O'Meara and were accused of racially abusing and bulling their fellow housemate Bollywood star, Shilpa Shetty. After leaving the house Jo went into hiding while Jade, who apologised profusely for her actions, was subject to death threats.

2010: In 2010 rapper Coolio decided to leave the Big Brother house of his own accord following a fight with Nadia Almada. In the same year racing pundit John McCririck came under fire for his misogynistic comments about women. 

2013: US reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag asked to speak to their lawyers after a particularly huge row in the Big Brother house in 2013. 

The fight between the pair and Neil 'Razor' Ruddock turned nasty after the couple had been accused of faking their relationship. Neil squared up to both Spencer and Heidi with fellow housemates Rylan Clark and Gillian Taylforth pulling him away from the situation. 

2014: Last year Linda Nolan ended up in floods of tears following an almighty row with fellow contestant Jim Davidson. The pair fought about Linda's late husband with Jim calling Linda an 'a**ehole,' he had bought up an incident in which her late husband Brian Hudson - who died in 2007 - had stolen money from Frank Carson's wallet.
