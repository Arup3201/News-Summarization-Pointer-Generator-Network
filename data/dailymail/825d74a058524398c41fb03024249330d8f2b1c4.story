Former Chelsea and Everton striker Samuel Eto’o has splashed out a serious amount of money to buy an Italian villa, reports Corriere Dello Sport.

The £18.5million Italian mansion was said to have been bought by Eto’o despite locals warning him it is haunted by the curse of the Tutankhamun.

The Cameroonian footballer has purchased the historic property in Portofino, near Genoa in northern Italy.

This luxury coastal villa in Italy is said to be jinxed by the curse of Tutankhamun after it was once owned by Lord Carnarvon who discovered the Pharaoh's tomb. Samuel Eto'o is said to have bought the property

The mansion has 40 rooms and 30,000 square-metres of land

Samuel Eto'o signed for Sampdoria after he decided to leave Everton during the January transfer window 

The property, called Villa Altachiara, was previously owned by Lord Carnarvon, who was known to be jinxed with the ‘Curse of the Pharaoh’.

Lord Carnarvon was working with famous English archaeologist Howard Carter when they discovered the tomb of Ancient Egyptian ruler Tutankhamun, opening the ‘cursed’ burial plot on February 16 1923.

Famously, of the 58 people present when Tutankhamun’s long-lost tomb was opened, eight died within a dozen years.

Working with well-known English archaeologist Howard Carter, Lord Carnarvon made the extraordinary discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the richest burial site ever found

Mysterious: Lord Carnavon (left), who died in 1923, financed the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb. Pictured right is former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta, who disappeared from the villa in 2001, with her body washing up in near Saint-Tropez three weeks later amid various theories about what happened

Moreover, Lord Carnarvon bizarrely died after he got an infection after cutting a mosquito bite on his face while shaving.

In addition, Lord Carnarvon’s nephew died in Villa Altachiara by falling down the stairs, while more recently, in 2001, former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta vanished from the cliff-top property.

Those scary stories, however, have not deterred the former Chelsea and Everton man to buy Villa Altachiara.

As to the property itself, the mansion has 40 rooms and 30,000 square-metres of land.
