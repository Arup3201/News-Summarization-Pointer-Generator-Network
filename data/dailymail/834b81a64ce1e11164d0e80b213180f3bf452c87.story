Evil: Matthew Atherton, 23, and Anne Turnbull, 30, leave Preston Crown Court after being charged with neglect. Their three-month-old son, Liam, died from pneumonia after they held a drunken all-night party

A couple who left their four-month-old baby to die of pneumonia on a winter's night while they threw a drunken party are facing jail.

Matthew Atherton, 23, girlfriend Anne Turnbull, 30, and three friends sank 60 cans of lager, Jack Daniels whiskey and wine whilst little Liam Atherton was succumbing to the effects of cold and hunger.

The infant had been diagnosed with a cold earlier that day yet had been left in a downstairs room whilst the back door was left open to allow the cigarette smoke from the party to filter outside.

Despite the youngster suffering a seizure, his unconcerned parents ignored pleas by guests to call an ambulance.

He was eventually found lifeless
in his moses basket at 11.15am the following morning after Turnbull 
went to check on him. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a
short time later.

Police
who went to the house in Blackburn, Lancs., following the tragedy in 
January 2011 found a wheelie bin stuffed full of empty lager cans and 
wine bottles. The kitchen tops were also covered with empty alcohol 
cans.

Blood tests ordered by
the police showed Atherton was three times the drink drive limit at the
time Liam was discovered. It emerged the party had gone on until 7am. 
The couple were known to social services who had been giving them 
support.

At Preston Crown Court, Atherton and Turnbull, both admitted a charge of child neglect and were warned they could be jailed.

Earlier
the hearing was told Liam had been born prematurely in September 2010 
and spent his first few weeks of his life in the neonatal intensive care
unit at the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

No remorse: Smirking Atherton after the court hearing. He and Turnbull drank until 7am on the night Liam died

Callous: Turnbull held the party despite knowing Liam was ill and vulnerable

His
early arrival meant the boy was taking special medication to encourage 
his development. On the day of the tragedy he had been seen by the 
health visitor and she had diagnosed him with a cold.

But
despite his vulnerable condition his parents decided to throw a party 
at their terraced home and invited a handful of friends.

When the party was in full flow Turnbull invited her sister Zoe Heap and her partner to visit.

As
they arrived, Miss Heap discovered the front room where Liam was 
sleeping was cold and became angry after noticing the baby was hungry 
and in a wet nappy.

Miss 
Heap changed Liam and fed him and then passed him to her partner for him
to settle. But the youngster then suffered a 'fit or seizure'.

Turnbull
and Atherton, who have two other children under the age of two, were 
told about the seizure - but they refused to call an ambulance despite 
being encouraged by Miss Heap and her partner.

Atherton attributed the fit down to Liam having a cold and the tot was put back in his moses basket.

Police began investigating after being notified of Liam's sudden death by a nurse at the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

A
post-mortem examination at the time did not reveal any significant 
injuries but a coroner later ruled Liam had died from pneumonia. His 
parents were charged with neglect three weeks later.

Liam died in his parents' house in Blackburn. He suffered a fit before he passed away

Atherton initially denied wrongdoing but changed his mind and pleaded guilty on the second day of his trial.

Both
he and Turnbull were bailed for the preparation of reports but were 
told by Judge Christopher Cornwall: 'All sentencing options remain 
open.' Both will be sentenced on June 21.

After
the case Detective Sergeant Sarah Hargreaves, of Blackburn police 
public protection unit, said: 'The conclusion of this case comes after a
protracted and sensitive inquiry. I hope the sentence will reflect the 
gravity and the seriousness of this offence.'

At
the time of the tragedy neighbours said they saw Turnbull shouting and 
screaming in the street after dialing 999. One said: 'She had gone to 
sleep on the couch, with the baby put in his rocker. But when she woke 
up, he wasn't breathing.

'Then
there was a lot of commotion. It is devastating news. You just think of
your own children at a time like this - I couldn't live through 
something like that.'

A 
spokesman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said: 'This is a tragic 
case, the family were known to children's services and we had previously
been supporting them.

'We are working closely with the police and fully co-operating with the ongoing investigation.'
