Police are given bouquets of flowers to victims in an attempt to 'soften the blow' of hard to solve crimes burglaries and muggings.

Success rates for the detection of burglaries are as low as 12 per cent in the areas where forces are giving out flowers, including London and west Mercia.

Victims told The Sunday Telegraph that while they appreciate the thought, they would rather that police focused on solving their crimes.

Nice thought: Police have been giving bouquets of flowers to people who have been burgled or mugged

The Met has sent out 300 bouquets in the north London borough of Barnet since November, including one to 55-year-old Sarah Miller.

She had two laptops, a camera and other valuables stolen from her home.

The day after the burglary Mrs Miller received a card apologising as the lack of evidence made it unlikely that her crime could be solved.

But the following day she received a £25 bouquet of flowers as well as a £5 voucher for the florist that donated them.

Mrs Miller said that although the flowers are lovely, she would rather the police used their resources elsewhere.

She said: 'Don't get me wrong, it was nice to receive them, but the thought that went into that could have gone into solving the burglary.

'I'd rather they'd have sent a community officer to comfort me after it happened rather than fobbing me off with flowers.'

Last year in London there were 55,693 residential burglaries, with only 12.5 per cent of them being recorded as solved, slightly below the national average for England and Wales of 13 per cent.

Police say that the gesture is meant to soften the blow of hard to solve crimes

A spokesman for the Met said: 'Giving someone glowers helps soften the blow and shows we are there to support them. We have found that just that simple gesture helps start up a dialogue with victims and helps them begin to feel safe again.'

Lancaster based flower wholesaler iFlorist donates 16 bunches a week free of charge.

They aim to increase their business while providing the flowers to people who have been through a hard time.

The West Mercia police force is also giving out flowers to victims as part of a local initiative started four years ago.

The flowers are paid for by the proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property, and contributions from officers and the public.
