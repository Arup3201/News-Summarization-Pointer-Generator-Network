It may not be The Bachelor, The Voice or even American Idol, but it seems even the yearly State Of The Union address is struggling to bring in the viewers.

Whether you liked it or not, all the major networks whether they be English or Spanish were tuned in to watch President Obama deliver his annual speech on Tuesday - and even then, only 33.3 million people saw what he had to say.

By comparison, this weekend's Super Bowl is likely to pull in well over 100 millions viewers.

Viewership was down sharply from Obama's largest audience, some 52 million people who tuned in to see his first address in 2009.

Last year, Obama pulled in 33.5 million 
viewers. This year's fell just short with the yearly speech getting its 
lowest ratings since 2000.

According to the Nielsen Co. which monitors television ratings, 16 networks carried the speech live, its biggest total ever. (In 2009, it was 10 networks.) The cable news networks use their numbers for the speech as signposts of interest among their news viewers.

CBS
 was the most-watched broadcast network with an average 7.6 million 
viewers, followed by NBC with 7 million and ABC with 5.6 million.

On
 cable, Fox News Channel was the leader with 4.7 million viewers. MSNBC 
averaged 2.3 million, while CNN was in third place with 2.1 million.

By
 comparison, President Bush's smallest audience for a State of the Union
 was 37.5 million in 2008, and President Clinton's was 31.5 million in 
2000.

During
 the State of the Union which ran for an hour and six minutes on Tuesday
 night, Obama discussed the economy, health care and other domestic 
issues, while touching on foreign policy.

He is currently on a tour promoting the policies he discussed in his speech, and will give at interview to CNN later this week.

Last year, President Obama hit his personal rock bottom in ratings for a State of the Union address.

About 33.5 million people tuned in for the speech, the lowest number since 2000, when about 31.5 million watched President Bill Clinton’s State of the Union swan song.

But Mr. Obama’s numbers were actually worse than that.

IN terms of household ratings - the percentage of U.S. television households that tuned into the speech at any given moment — last year’s State Of The Union garnered a score of 21.8.

That was the lowest in the last 20 years of data, even worse than 2000’s 22.4.

Household ratings offer a better comparison of viewership than raw viewer numbers because they take into account changes in the number of TV households.
