Charges: Jermaine Pennant will hear the case against him in court next week

Stoke City star Jermaine Pennant allegedly attacked a woman and then crashed his car while drunk in the early hours of this morning.

The 29-year-old former England Under-21 international was today charged with drink-driving, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance after his white BMW collided with a silver Audi in Sale at 5.20am.

The driver of the Audi was taken to hospital after the collision, which took place ten minutes from Pennant's luxury mansion in Hale, Cheshire.

The Audi driver was later discharged after treatment for minor back injuries.

Pennant will appear at Trafford Magistrates' Court to hear the driving-related charges on Wednesday 9
May.

Police apparently arrested the footballer following an allegation that a woman had been assaulted at a Manchester nightclub just under two hours before the accident.

A police spokesperson said: 'At approximately 3.30am a woman was assaulted at a nightclub on Barton Arcade, Manchester City Centre.

'A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of section 47 assault. He has been bailed pending further inquiries.'

Pennant was signed by Arsenal for £2million on his 16th birthday, following a difficult childhood.

His career looked to be on the up when he signed for Liverpool for £6.7million and he later went on to play in Spain.

After having a child, Trey, he said his troubled past was behind him, but a few months later he finished with his fiancee Lara Murphy.

He joined Stoke in the 2010-11 season and played in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal.

In February 2004, Pennant was given a
sixteen-month ban from driving after being seen in the wrong lane in 
Paddington, West London.

In 2005, while on loan at 
Birmingham, the 22-year-old Arsenal midfielder crashed in the centre of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, at 6.20am.

His eyes were glazed and his speech 
slurred, and a breath test found he was almost two-and-a-half times the 
legal alcohol limit, the court 
heard.

He spent 30 days in jail for drink-driving and driving 
while still serving his previous ban.

He initially told officers that he was his Arsenal team mate Ashley Cole.

Two years later, the Liverpool player
collapsed on a flight from Spain to Stansted following a 24-hour 
drinking binge.

This is not the first time Pennant has landed in hot water over his behaviour off the pitch.

In February 2004, Pennant was banned from from driving, and in 2005 he spent 30 days in prison for drink-driving and driving 
while still serving his previous ban.

The teenage prodigy was a £3.2million signing and then the youngest player to play for the club, but Arsene Wenger eventually ran out of patience with his poor time-keeping and lack of discipline.

He returned to Birmingham after his conviction - and even played while wearing an electronic tag.

Defending Pennant in 2005, Barry Warburton told the court he had never been in trouble during a difficult childhood in Nottingham.

Mr Warburton said he grew up on 'one of the worst estates' in the city, the eldest of four children, and brought up the three others after his mother left until he was 15.

Pennant had only 'intermittent' schooling, the court heard.

'When he left school and arrived at Arsenal FC, he had very little reading and writing skills. "They have in fact educated him,' Mr Warburton said.
