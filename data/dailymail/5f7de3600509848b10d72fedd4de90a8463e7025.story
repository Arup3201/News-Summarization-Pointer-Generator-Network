The global super-rich are using loopholes to hide up to £20trillion from the taxman, a report said yesterday.

The figure is more than the combined gross domestic product of the US and Japan and is a threat to the very essence of democracy, said campaigners.

The report, The Price of Offshore Revisited, shows how money is being siphoned into offshore banks instead of being invested at home.

The report says secretive jurisdictions including Hong Kong are receiving huge influxes of funds from a global super elite

Its author, James Henry, a former 
chief economist at consultancy McKinsey, used data from the World Bank, 
International Monetary Fund, United Nations and central banks.

His report gave a total of at least 
£13trillion, but said assets he had not been able to identify could make
 it as high as £20trillion. Mr Henry said the assets of ‘high-net-worth 
individuals’ are being protected by ‘professional enablers’ taking 
advantage of gaps in cross-border tax rules.

According to his calculations, £6.3trillion of assets are owned by 92,000 people – or 0.001 per cent of the world’s population.

John Christensen, of the international
 campaign group Tax Justice Network, which commissioned the research, 
said: ‘What the [£13trillion] figure doesn’t include is the 
non-financial assets, the yachts, the jets, the works of art, the real 
estate.’

The Cayman Islands ranked highly in a list of nations where a large quantity of the huge sums are heading annually

Mr Christensen added: ‘I would say 
this is a defining moment for democracy, because unless people feel 
governments are treating taxpayers fairly our faith in democracy 
disappears. I know that people feel angry.’

A previous Financial Secrecy Index 
compiled by the Tax Justice Network ranks the jurisdictions enjoying an 
influx of capital in a Financial Secrecy Index.

The top 10 private banks in the world including UBS were estimated to be managing around £4trillion in funds in 2010

In the table for 2011, it suggests 
that Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and Hong Kong are 
amongst the nations where a large amount of the huge sums are heading.

And despite the popular perception of 
tax havens as being small isolated islands, the campaign group says that
 the biggest players in 'the supply of financial secrecy' are almost all
 wealthy nations.

The group also estimates that around 
$250bn is lost in taxes each year by governments worldwide as a result 
of the wealthiest individuals holding their assets offshore.

The total value of the money being leaked from some nations even dwarfs the debts they often owe to the rest of the world.

According to the Tax Justice Network, the consequences of this tax avoidance are severe.

'Secrecy distorts trade and investment
 flows, and creates a criminogenic environment for a litany of evils 
that hurt the citizens of rich and poor countries alike.

'It’s not just developing countries 
that suffer: European countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal have 
been brought to their knees by decades of secrecy and tax evasion.'

Estimates suggest that if the interest
 on the huge sums being lost were taxed at a rate of around 30%, around 
£121bn would be generated for the treasuries around the world.
