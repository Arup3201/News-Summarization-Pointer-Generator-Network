A former Apple employee named Sam Sung has raised more than $2,500 for charity by auctioning off his old business card after an initial bid of $80,200 was revealed to be fake.

Mr Sung, 25, worked for three years as a specialist at the Pacific Centre Apple store in Vancouver, where customers couldn't help but notice his distinctive name on his ID badge and employee T-shirt.

When he left the store, he decided to set up an eBay auction to sell off of his old personalized business cards - with the money raised going to The Children's Wish Foundation.

As the news of his coincidental name and charity auction spread across the world, the bids shot up to a staggering $80,200.

However, they were later revealed to be fake - with Mr Sung's card eventually selling for a lower sum of $2,653, with the winner also receiving his old uniform and lanyard.

But even though his donation to the charity is much less than he thought, he is still pleased with the money raised.

He told CNBC: 'I'm so pleased at the amount that was raised and, according to Children's Wish, anything over $2,000 is considered a major gift. So for me, that's a major win and it will go towards granting a terminally ill child's wish.

'I don't think we're supposed to keep any of that stuff [featured in the auction] but working for Apple was honestly one of the funnest jobs I've had, and I wanted to keep it as a memento.'

Good cause: Mr Sung had hoped to raise up to $80,000 after receiving the bid on eBay, but it turned out to be fake

In the post on the eBay page, where people were invited to bid, Mr Sung posed next to his business card, which is framed alongside his employee T-shirt and ID badge.

He wrote that he came up with the idea after one of his old business cards fell out of a book.

At first the auction created quite the buzz with bids rapidly flying up to $80,100 just few hours later, although this subsequently turned out to be a fake.

Mr Sung says he became interested in the Children's Wish Foundation, which aids children with serious illness, after attending an inaugural gala last winter.

Since then, he has volunteered on numerous projects and made it his mission to help out.

'Sam has clearly been touched by what we do and come up with a creative way to support us,' said Jennifer Peterson, the director of the charity's British Columbia branch.

'One of our recent wish children, who sadly passed away just after his travel wish, summed up his experience so profoundly by saying "I forgot I was sick,"' explained the charity director.

'Sam has made a choice to help us give another child and their family this gift.'
