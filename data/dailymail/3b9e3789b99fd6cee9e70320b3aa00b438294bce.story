With their throaty engines, gleaming chrome and endorsements from some of Hollywood’s coolest action heroes, Harley-Davidson have long been the motorcycle of choice for men – especially those in the grip of a mid-life crisis.

But the famous American firm is hoping that is all about to change – with the launch of two new bikes specifically designed for women.

The Street 500 and Street 750 are the firm’s first new bikes in 13 years and bosses hope they will become the must-have 'little black number' in every woman’s garage.

Growing popularity: Harley Davidson have created new bikes especially for women following a 30 per cent rise in sales to female riders in the last decade

Designers have got rid of the large, bulbous petrol tanks and shiny chrome which are synonymous with Harley’s masculine style.

Instead the bikes have been given a sleek, black makeover and include smaller handle grips, lower seats and different foot peg positions to appeal to female riders.

The move to create a motorcycle for the female market has been fuelled by a 30 per cent rise in sales to women over the past decade in the US alone. One in 10 of Harley’s sales in America is now made to a woman.

Each May Harley holds Women Riders Month and the firm has also been holding 'garage parties' to teach motorcycle basics to women – such as how to pick up a bike safely – for the past eight years.

Around 10,000 customers, many of them women, also attend Harley’s riding instruction programmes for people new to motorbikes each year in the US.

International Female Ride Day – originally set up to celebrate women riders in Canada in 2006 – which is now celebrated in the US and UK, as well as countries further afield such as India, Russia and Brazil, is also proof of the rising popularity of motorcycling among the fairer sex, experts say.

They reckon that focusing on the female market will help Harley challenge its Japanese competitors, especially Kawasaki and Suzuki.
