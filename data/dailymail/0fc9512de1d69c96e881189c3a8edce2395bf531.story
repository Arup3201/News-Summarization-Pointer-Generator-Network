Those frequent gym sessions and the super healthy eating plan is clearly paying off because Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looks amazing in the latest campaign shots for the Rosie for Autograph Spring collection.

The 25-year-old models the collection herself, of course, and it includes a flirty floral blue padded bra with matching briefs as well as a vintage lace long line silk bra.

In a soft palette of dusky blues, pale peach and white, the Rosie for Autograph Summer collection exudes feminine glamour. Designed exclusively for M&S by Rosie herself, pieces are crafted in delicate silk and trimmed with fine, couture designed lace to create, what she says she hopes to be, the ultimate in luxury lingerie.

New shapes for Summer include the 50s 
inspired long-line bra with lace and silk detailing and the high-waisted
 knicker as well as the non-pad lace bra and a silk body, designed to smooth the silhouette under clothing.

Speaking about her collection, Rosie said: 'I’ve enjoyed working on the Summer collection and it’s been
 great designing new styles to add to the range.

'My favourite pieces are
 the long-line bra and high waisted knicker – I just love the vintage 
styling and they are both so flattering to the figure.'

Working
 together in collaboration with 
Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Design for lingerie at M&S, Rosie’s 
collection is designed to be a bit of 'everyday luxury', and the softer 
hues were used with Summer brides in mind.

Soozie added: 'The cool 
aquatic and silver tones we developed provide a fresh new direction as 
we step into summer, whilst the ivory and sand tones create luxe summer 
solutions on sun kissed skin.

'All the much loved signature vintage 
reference points are here in the new silk collection with new styles 
such as long line bralets, bodies and non padded bras adding to the 
range.'

Last month, Rosie unveiled some key pieces from her Spring collection, which was released just in time for Valentine's Day.

Rosie’s signature silk pad bra, 
kimono wrap and chemise set were all reworked in gorgeous new colours 
and prints, with the hand-painted floral design inspired by original Art
 Nouveau rose motifs.

At the time Rosie said: 'We decided 
upon a gorgeous palette of blush pinks and warm neutrals which every 
women will love to wear.'

New nightwear pieces that were also 
launched for Spring were the flirty babydoll, the delicate silk 
nightdress with a glamorous floor-sweeping hemline and intricate lace 
trim and the chiffon wrap, the perfect boudoir style cover-up for 
bedroom.

While she is known for her love of yoga and regular gym sessions, the Victoria's Secret Angel has also divulged another of her secret health weapons.

The 25-year-old tweeted a picture of herself praising her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a great way to start the day.' But what’s behind this mysterious concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber, kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the juice.

It’s an entirely natural and balanced, 
single-celled, green algae, which, due to combination of nutrients and 
amino acid abundance, chlorella is linked to healthy nails, skin and 
hair- and judging by Rosie's killer body, it is clearly working.
