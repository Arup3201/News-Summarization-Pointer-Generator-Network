Jason Manford (pictured) is worried he may have testicular cancer, after finding a lump

Comedian Jason Manford has revealed he has been struck by a cancer scare, fearing a lump he found on his 'favourite testicle' could be the disease.

The stand-up discovered an abnormality on his left testicle and told his Facebook followers that he has booked an urgent doctor’s appointment to get it checked out.

The 33-year-old showed his sense of humour, telling his fans he found the 'little lump on my favourite testicle'.

Updating fans yesterday evening, the comedian from Salford wrote: ‘[I’ve] booked in a doctor’s appointment tomorrow for a check, I'm sure it's nowt but it's good to talk about these things.’

In another update this morning, before heading to his daughters’ sports day, the father-of-three said: ‘I can't help thinking the papers have slightly overreacted to my Facebook post but if I guess if it makes another bloke get himself checked then it's worth it!’

He is currently finishing the final dates of a long UK tour.

Mr Manford 
wrote on Facebook yesterday: ‘My body "hey brain, has Jason got much work in this 
week after his 220-date, 6 nights a week tour?"

‘My body "oh good" My brain "why do you ask?"

‘My body "oh, I'm just thinking of f*****g him right up with a bit of the flu, a frozen shoulder, back ache and a swollen ankle...oh and schedule an appointment in at the doctors cause I've just developed a lump on his left testicle so he can spend the rest of his break either ill or worried.”

‘Cheers body!’

Sharing his scare on Facebook with more than 800,000 followers, the comedian, who has presented TV shows including 8 out of 10 cats and A Question of Sport, said: 'Super Saturday, encouraged other men to check out any worrying lumps, before posting a link to the NHS’ cancer prevention page.'

Mr Manford met bowel cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton and helped him raise money for The Teenage Cancer Trust, before Stephen tragically died in May.

He rallied celebrities to join a Thumbs up for Stephen campaign on Twitter, which helped the teenager raise over £3million before he died. The total is currently at around £4.1million.

On his Facebook page, he wrote: ‘Let's start a #thumbsupforStephen.

He gave us one, let's give him one back, and donated £10,000 to the cause.

Last night, Mr Manford, managed to find humour in the scary situation by writing that he has found 'a little lump on my favourite testacle' and this morning posted that he was surprised he has received so much attention

Testicular cancer usually affects men between the ages of 15 and 44.

Men are advised to visit a doctor as soon as possible if they notice any lump or swelling on their testicles.

Symptoms include:

Less than four per cent of testicular lumps are cancerous and swollen blood vessels are a common cause of them.

Testicular cancer is one of the less common forms of cancer, accounting for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men.

Each year, just over 2,000 men are diagnosed with it, according to Cancer Research UK.

Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer.

Over 95 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer can be completely cured, and even cases where the cancer has spread to nearby tissue, have an 80 per cent chance of being cured.
