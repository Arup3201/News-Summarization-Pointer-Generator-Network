The parents of a a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his ‘5-star jihad’ have been released on bail after being arrested over Syria-related terrorism offences.

Enu Miah, 57, and Hena Choudhury, 48, the parents of 23-year-old Ifthekar Jaman, were arrested yesterday in a dawn raid at their home in Southsea, Portsmouth.

Their son - who became known for his online advice to fellow British Muslims seeking to go to Syria - was killed in December after travelling to the war-torn country to fight government troops.

After the raid, Mr Miah was arrested on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism; engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and arranging availability of money and property for use in terrorism.

He was also arrested for engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and raising cash and property for the Syrian fighters who flocked to follow his son.

Ms Choudhury was detained on suspicion of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism. 

Both Mr Miah and Ms Choudhury have now been released on bail, police said.   

Three other members of Jaman's family who were also arrested yesterday remain in custody, Thames Valley Police said.

These include Mr Jaman's brother Tuhin, 26, and Mustakim, 23, both from Portsmouth, and their 29-year-old sister Tamannah Shaharin, who was arrested in Greenwich, south east London. 

They were arrested by the south east counter terrorism unit yesterday and are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.

Police stood guard outside the terrace house in Southsea, where the door window was smashed during the dawn raid

A 23-year-old woman from Farnborough, Hampshire, was also arrested over the same alleged offences. 

A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the arrests were related to the conflict in Syria.

He said: 'Officers would like to reassure residents that the police activity... is in relation to conflicts overseas and is not linked to any immediate threat to local communities or anywhere else in the UK.'  

A Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the arrests - which led to the front door being smashed - were related to the conflict in Syria 

After the raid, police were seen standing guard outside the terraced house in Hudson Road, Portsmouth, where Jaman used to live.

The same property - which now has a smashed front door and is surrounded by police tape  - was previously targeted by police in April.

The family’s business, Masala Takeaway in Portsmouth, was also raided.  

Detectives also swooped on Shaharin's semi-detached home where she lives with her husband Muhib Ud Deen Mohammed Khan, 33, and his parents.

A dozen policemen searched the property and vehicles in the driveway. Shaharin’s husband, son and parents-in-law were seen arriving home under police guard and picked up some belongings before leaving. 

Jaman became known for his online advice and encouragement to fellow British Muslims seeking to go to Syria, including women, whom he urged to marry men back from the front lines. 

The 23-year-old became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the ‘holy war’ in Syria was like ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature.

He also claimed it was ‘cool’ to hold a gun. 

The former Sky call centre worker left the UK last year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey. On May 14, he slipped across the border to Syria.

In a series of calls back to England, Jaman managed to persuade five of his friends from Portsmouth and another three from Manchester to go out and fight alongside him.

Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Jaman had described fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature

Separately, police investigating possible terrorism offences have also been given more time to hold a number of other suspects.

Counter-terror officers said they had disrupted what is believed to be the early stages of what could have turned into a 'significant plot' following the raids in central and west London last Tuesday.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism command (SO15) have been given until October 21 to hold three of the men arrested that day.

The suspects, a 21-year-old man and two aged 20, were arrested in London on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

Two other men arrested on the same date for the same offences were released from custody on Monday.

Counter-terrorism officers have also been granted more time to hold a 24-year-old man arrested on Monday on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Scotland Yard said it had applied for and been granted a further extension until Sunday.

Two other men - aged 21 and 25 - who were arrested on Monday for the same offences remain in custody.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 321.
