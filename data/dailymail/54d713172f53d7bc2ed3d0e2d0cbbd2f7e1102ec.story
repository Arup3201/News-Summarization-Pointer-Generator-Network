Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has re-iterated his innocence after being accused by his former employers and former Leeds owners GFH Capital of falsifying invoices and diverting money into accounts controlled by him.

The figures that have been reported amount to around £3million.

Haigh, who is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities in Dubai despite having shared a cell with other prisoners at the Bur Dubai Police Station Jail since May 18, has enlisted the services of forensic investigators at Price Waterhouse Coopers in a bid to clear his name.

In May GFH released a statement confirming 36-year-old Haigh had been arrested ‘on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering while he was employed at the bank.’

A spokesman for Haigh said: ‘David continues to maintain his complete innocence of any wrongdoing. He denies all the civil claims made against him.

‘Independent handwriting tests carried out on his behalf have established that the forged signatures on the invoices were not his.

‘At the same time a report by Price Waterhouse Cooper says that the dossier containing the basis for GFH’s allegations provides no evidence that David either created false invoices or diverted GFH money into accounts controlled by him.

‘After 136 days of incarceration, David has neither been questioned about criminal wrongdoing nor charged with any criminal offence.

‘He believes his continued detention in these circumstances is in clear breach of his human rights. 

‘Notwithstanding the desire of his former employers to keep him in jail, David remains confident that the Dubai legal system will uphold his innocence thus freeing him to pursue his own wide-ranging claims against GFH.’

Haigh, who has now served over four months in prison, has consistently denied he used false invoices to embezzle almost £3m from GFH Capital, the former owners of the football club, while head of their private equity arm.

In a statement, GFH Capital said: ‘Mr Haigh and his team have made repeated claims in the media that he has been denied the most basic amenities of life during his period of detention by the Dubai authorities, asserting that his living conditions have made it impossible for him to concentrate and effectively defend himself. However, a hearing in the DIFC Court on September 15 before Mr Justice Sir David Steel revealed a very different story.’

Court documents revealed by GFH showed Justice Steel rejected a claim by the defence that Haigh needed another $500 a week to have food, water and toiletries sent into him in prison.

GFH Capital said the hearing was also told that Haigh claims current monthly outgoings in the United Kingdom of some £26,000 ($42,090) per month, including £1,000 a month for gym membership, £1,000 on telephone calls and £3,000 a month to a partner.

‘Mr Haigh has frequently claimed that he is unable to communicate by telephone to instruct his legal team. However, he claims to spend in excess of $500 a week on phone calls from the detention centre,’ it added in the statement.

‘Despite his claims that it was difficult to receive medical treatment, he has had access to an on-site doctor and has been permitted trips from his cell to receive private, specialist outside medical treatment. In addition, he claimed to be spending $500 per week on medicines in the form of protein, vitamins and supplements,’ GFH Capital said.

In answer to his claims that he has no funds to pay his legal team, GFH Capital said it has agreed that £200,000 be held on account by Haigh’s lawyers to pay his legal costs.
