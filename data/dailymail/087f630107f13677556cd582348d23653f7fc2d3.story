Doctors have been given the go-ahead to perform a caesarean section on a mentally-ill woman who is 36 weeks pregnant.

High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden ruled that the woman could lawfully be sedated - and restrained if necessary, following a hearing at the Court of Protection in London.

Doctors at a health authority in Sunderland had asked the judge to declare a caesarean section lawful.

Doctors have tonight been given the go-ahead to perform a caesarean section on a mentally-ill woman who is 36 weeks pregnant, by a High Court judge at the Court of Protection

They had said that the woman, who is in her 30s and has a schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, had a liver condition which posed a risk to her and her unborn baby, and that the delivery by caesarean section was in the best interests of both.

They said it was not clear whether the woman would agree to having a caesarean section, but that the woman's father agreed with doctors.

He told the judge that his daughter was in 'such a state' that a 'normal birth' would be 'far too stressful' for her.

A lawyer appointed by the court to represent the woman also agreed with doctors.

Mr Justice Hayden said there was 'compelling evidence' that the woman lacked the mental capacity to evaluate medical advice.

The judge said there was also compelling evidence that if well she would put her unborn child's interests first and follow medical advice.

He was told that the woman's mental health problems were intermittent and that she was a graduate who had built a successful career.

Doctors said they aimed to deliver the baby tomorrow.

It was planned that the woman's parents would initially care for the baby, the judge heard.

But he was told that doctors hoped that her condition would improve so that she could assume responsibility.

Mr Justice Hayden said nothing could be reported which would identify the woman.

But the judge said the health authority which had made the application to perform surgery - City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust - could be named.

The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and judges analyse issues relating to sick and vulnerable people.
