The announcement by Sony last week that they would not be releasing the upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview shocked many, especially when government officials confirmed that it was in fact North Korea who was behind the massive hacking of the movie studio.

Their success was short lived however, as just days later, Sony reversed their decision, deciding to put the film in selected theaters across the country while also releasing it on video on demand on Christmas day.

And now, North Korea and their Supreme Leader are getting mocked again thanks to a new photo sweeping social media that shows the stoic and stern Kim Jong-un with a full face of make-up and the hashtag ‪'#‎YouCantSilenceOurFreedomOfSpeech‬.'

Hacked: Government officials confirmed last week that North Korea and Kim Jong-un (above) were in fact behind the recent Sony hack

Shut it down: The hack was an attempt to get Sony to cancel the release of their film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un (above)

The photo, which has been splashed across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, urges individuals to share, retweet or regram, 'for no other reason than to piss off North Korea.'

This as Kim Jong-un continues to deny that he or his country had anything to do with the massive hack, which saw the release of thousands of private emails between executives at the company, and ultimately culminated with a threat of terrorism aimed at any movie theater set to play the film. 

President Obama referred to the hack as an act of 'cybervandalism' by North Korea, while North Korea has stated that they believe the hack was the work of the United States government. 

Sony had been widely criticized following their decision last week to shelf the movie, despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market.

Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward.

George Clooney also weighed in, saying; 'We cannot be told we can't see something by Kim Jong-un, of all f***ing people.'

Party guy: The film also depicts Kim Jong-un as a party animal and ladies man

Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike, who between them operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas, had announced last Wednesday that they wouldn't be showing the movie. 

Sony had previously told exhibitors that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats. 

The film will be carried in selected independent theaters around the country for one week starting on Thursday.
