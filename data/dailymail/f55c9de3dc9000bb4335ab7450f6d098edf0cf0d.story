They are experts in the arts of patience, multi-tasking and time management.

But when it comes to technology, it seems some parents have a lot to learn.

These photos show hilarious text messages that American parents have sent to their baffled children.

One text has been sent by a mother who clearly struggles with the concept of Google - or, as she calls it, 'the Google'.

It reads: 'Please stop changing the google logo so much. I like the original one' - to which her confused child replies: 'Mom I don't change the logo. Google changes it'.

It goes on: 'You don't run the google?' - prompting her child to joke: 'If I did I wouldn't be driving a 2004 ford.'

Another tech-troubled mother informs her child by text that their 'great aunt just passed away LOL'.Â

Confusion: Other amusing messages see a mother insults her child (left) and another write in Chinese (right)

After being told the three-letter word stands for 'laugh out loud', the horrified woman writes: 'Oh my goodness! I sent that to everyone. I thought it meant lots of love. I have to call everyone back.'

And one father's informative text to his son, 'You left your phone at home', backfires as he texts the device that has been left behind.

Other amusing messages include a mother who has accidentally written in Chinese and a father who has sent the automatic message 'I'm in a meeting' a staggering eight times in a row.

But one man appears to understand the art of texting perfectly well - and even uses it to play a prank on his son.

He writes: 'Son your in big trouble (sic)' - to which, his alarmed son replies: 'WHY?'.

The father then says: 'Because your texting me while your in school (sic)'.

And one woman feels so confident about her texting ability that she uses the phrase 'chillaxxing' - to which her embarrassed child replies: 'No one says that anymore'.
