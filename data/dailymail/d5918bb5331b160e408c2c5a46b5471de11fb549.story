A troubled funfair ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland will be permanently removed after children were left dangling 65ft in the air for 40 minutes in freezing conditions. 

At least eight youngsters were trapped on the Sky Swing after the ride broke down due to an electrical fault last night.

It is the second time the ride has gone wrong in a month, coming just three weeks after two carriages collided on the amusement ride while spinning almost 200ft up in the air.

Children were left dangling 65ft in the air for 40 minutes in freezing conditions after an amusement ride at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland broke down

Emergency services were called in to help rescue the passengers left shivering around 65ft in the air as the temperature dipped to around 2C.

The 12-seat side, which rises to heights of up to 200ft in the air, stopped and became stuck just before the halfway mark. 

Fire crews began preparing ladders to rescue revellers, but the  ride became operational again and passengers were lowered back down to ground level. 

Ellie-May Jones, 12, from Newport was trapped on the ride and her father Luke, who was watching from the ground, said she was 'cold and frightened'. 

'It looked like they tried to re-start it about 20 times, they seemed to be going through manuals,' he said.

'Ellie-May was so high up she looked like a dot. She was so cold and frightened. It was every parent's worse nightmare.'

Simon Gale, who saw the ride break down, said: 'It's horrible and cold, so it must be pretty scary up there.'

Chris Averis, 26, said: 'It had apparently been stuck for over an hour, I certainly won't be going on it.'

The operators of the Sky Swing suspended the ride while they carried out an investigation and confirmed it has been axed and will be replaced by a smaller attraction called the Mega Swing. 

The ride is due to be dismantled this evening. 

'We are not going to take any chances,' said a spokesman for Sayer's Amusements. 

'An electrical malfunction occurred with the Sky Swing, when the ride's safety procedures operated automatically, stopping the ride as it descended. 

'All passengers were checked over by our medical staff, and given hot drinks when they came off the ride, and all were of course given full refunds, in addition to our apologies for any anxiety caused.

This comes just three weeks after two carriages collided on the amusement ride while spinning almost 200ft up in the air 

'They were all comfortable with the way the situation was handled. Though the emergency services were called, they were not required to intervene. 

'Public safety is our paramount concern, and though no one was injured, we will be investigating this incident fully.' 

The terrifying moment when two carriages collided on the amusement ride earlier this month was captured by spectators filming the ride at ground level

After initially joking about how close together some of the carriages were swinging, those filming the incident reacted with shock when they witnessed the collision.

One said: 'It looks like its going to hit her. See that? It him them.'

His friend then responds: 'Oh my God it's hit them. They've stopped the ride.'

Leanne Williams described the collision as the 'scariest moment of my life'. 

The ride's operators Sayer's Amusements are currently investigating the fault and the ride will only be operational again when they are satisfied it has been resolved

All passengers were checked by medical staff and given hot drinks along with full refunds for the ride
