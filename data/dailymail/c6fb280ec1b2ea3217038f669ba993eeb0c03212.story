It has horrified children and parents alike – and will certainly not please Santa if he is watching with his reindeer.

A television advert for the Littlewoods mail order company has been seen as hinting that Father Christmas does not exist.

It features children in a Christmas play who sing about who has bought their presents, with a chorus which says their mothers have done all the shopping.

Under fire: A Littlewoods TV ad featuring a nativity play in which children sing a song about how it is 'muvver', and not Father Christmas, who puts the presents under the tree has angered parents

The Advertising Standards Authority 
has ruled that the ad can continue to be shown despite having received 
456 complaints that it destroys children’s belief that Santa Claus puts 
the presents under the tree.

Many of the complaints called for the 40-second advert to be rescheduled to a time slot after youngsters have gone to bed.

And a Facebook petition has been 
launched demanding it is taken off the air altogether. One parent said: 
‘Thanks, Littlewoods for letting the magic of Santa be trashed.’

Fury: Hundreds of viewers have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the advert, saying it has caused their children distress by revealing that Father Christmas does not exist

Another said: ‘It has upset a lot of 
parents new and experienced. Children have been coming to their parents 
asking them why Santa doesn’t come on Christmas Eve to deliver the 
presents.’

The advert has also been criticised 
for encouraging parents to spend too much on Christmas gifts. It shows 
‘muvver’ using her credit card to pay for luxury goods that she 
otherwise might not be able to afford.

A further Facebook posting said: ‘This
ad should be banned. Shame on you Littlewoods, especially as we are 
going through tough times. Putting such pressure on parents who struggle
as it is to keep jobs and make ends meet.’ 

Hundreds more people have signed a Facebook page petitioning for the ad to be scrapped

The ASA said its council had decided 
‘after careful consideration that, as the ad did not make reference to 
Father Christmas or suggest Father Christmas did not exist, it was 
unlikely to cause distress to children and therefore we won’t be 
launching an investigation’.

A spokesman for Littlewoods said: ‘We 
would never want to suggest that Santa doesn’t exist. We carried out a 
lot of research and found families have different Christmas traditions.

‘‘Some told us that Santa puts the presents in the stocking while family and friends place gifts under the tree.

‘Others said that Santa brings most of
the presents but mum and dad do buy some presents for the children as 
well as the gifts for the rest of the family. We like to think of 
Christmas as a team effort.’
