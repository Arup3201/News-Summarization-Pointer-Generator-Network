A South Carolina mother has been arrested after allegedly slapping a young boy she mistook for her son before apologizing and knocking her actual son to the floor.

Spartanburg County sheriff deputies say Tyshekka Collier, 36, walked into Fairforest Middle School to pick up her son who was being suspended when she slapped the child who was waiting to go home sick.

Principal Ty Dawkins told WYFF that that mistaken boy was sitting with his head down when he was abruptly hit on Wednesday morning.

Not playing: Police say Tyshekka Collier, 36, slapped a boy she mistook to be her son on Wednesday before apologizing and knocking her actual son to the floor

Fortunately, he says, when Collier realized she had slapped the wrong child she immediately apologized.

But once seeing her actual child in the room, the arrest warrant says she went over to him and slapped him across the face and head too, knocking him to the ground.

'I believe he was more scared than stunned over anything else,’ said Mr Dawkins of the mistaken boy’s reaction.

'But still this is the kind of behavior that you don't need to do to anybody, even to your own children,' he said.

Big mistake: Fairforest Middle School's principal said that the mistaken boy was sick and waiting for his own mother to pick him up when Collier walked into the office and hit him

Collier was charged with disturbing school and assault and battery. It wasn't known if she had a lawyer.

'...in speaking with the parents and all the interviews that were done -- the two charges for the assaults and disturbing school, we felt were the most appropriate means to go with,' Mr Dawkins added.

Collier’s three children are in now protective custody.
