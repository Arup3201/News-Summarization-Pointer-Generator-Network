The country's president, Baldwin Lonsdale, has estimated the cyclone, which struck on Saturday, has destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital of Port Vila.

Vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over 65 islands. About 47,000 people live in the capital.

Structural damage across Port Vila is extensive with the majority of homes severely damaged or destroyed.

With power lines and phone circuits down, officials have no way of knowing the scope of the damage and injuries on the hard-hit outer islands. 

Hannington Alatoa, head of the Vanuatu Red Cross Society, said flyovers by New Zealand and Australian relief teams showed much of the country had been 'flattened.'

'No trees, no foliage, no iron structures standing on the western part of Tanna (island),' Alatoa said. 'People are in great need of water.'

The archipelago found itself in the path of the category five storm after it unexpectedly changed direction.

The RAF package, containing 1,640 shelter kits and 1,900 solar lanterns with phone chargers, comes after the UK Government announced a £2m donation towards UN humanitarian aid efforts. 

A C-17 transport plane flew out from RAF Brize Norton this morning bound for the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley, Australia, before linking up with international agencies.

A humanitarian expert from the Department for International Development has also been deployed to offer advice and assistance on field assessments, while the RAF crew will carry out support flights over several days.

President Lonsdale said today: 'This is a very devastating cyclone in Vanuatu. I term it as a monster, a monster. It's a setback for the government and for the people of Vanuatu. After all the development that has taken place, all this development has been wiped out.'

'So it means we will have to start anew again.' 

In Port Vila smashed boats litter the harbour and sodden piles of household belongings are tangled among twisted tree branches where homes once stood.

Many of the city's residents are spending today clearing away downed trees and cleaning up what was left of their houses. 

UNICEF spokeswoman Alice Clements said access to food and water is an urgent concern.

Much of the city's water supply has been tainted, so many residents are boiling water to drink.

The hospital is overwhelmed with patients and cannot treat everyone that needs help, Clements said.

She said she spoke to a woman who is nine months pregnant and lost her home in the storm. 

The woman's situation, along with many others, is growing desperate, Clements said.

'She has no water, no food, no power,' she said. 'This is an incredibly dangerous time.' 

The UK's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'The terrible effects of Cyclone Pam are now clear and many people are in urgent need of relief.

'The Royal Air Force's swift and invaluable support will ensure victims of the cyclone get the help they need to start putting their lives back together.

'Families' homes have been destroyed and power supplies are down. Our emergency shelter kits and solar lanterns will help meet people's basic needs and Britain stands ready to assist further.'

Paolo Malatu, coordinator for the National Disaster Management Office, said 'The damage to homes and infrastructure is severe,' he said.

'The priority at the moment is to get people water, food and shelter.'

He said there was major damage to many government buildings, and bridges were down outside the capital, making travel by vehicle impossible even around the main island of Efate.  

UNICEF has estimated that 54,000 children are among those affected by the cyclone.

The small island nation, located about a quarter of the way from Australia to Hawaii, has repeatedly warned it is already suffering devastating effects from climate change with the island's coastal areas being washed away, forcing resettlement to higher ground and smaller yields on traditional crops. 

The cyclone has already caused damage to other Pacific islands, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. 

Some homes were evacuated in New Zealand Monday to escape flooding as the weakening storm moved past the North Island's East Cape region.

Dr Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'Vanuatu highlights the vulnerability of people living in isolated regions to natural hazards. 

'Cyclone Pam is the largest storm to impact the islands since Cyclone Eric in 1985 and a World Bank report in 2006 highlighted that in years when a disaster struck, economic losses in Vanuatu averaged 30 per cent of their GDP.

'The largest challenge facing aid efforts will be the relative inaccessibility of the islands and the damage caused to the infrastructure by the incredibly high winds. 

'So far, reports of fatalities and damage are incomplete because of the lack of communications with outer islands in the archipelago. 

'The logistical challenges will be significant, particularly in terms of communications, transportation and needs assessments.'
