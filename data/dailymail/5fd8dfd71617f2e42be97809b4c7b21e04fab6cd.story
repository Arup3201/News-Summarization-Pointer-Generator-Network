Arsenal named six academy products on their bench with an average age of just 18 for their Champions League victory at Galatasaray.

Three of them - Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Stefan O'Connor - got on to the field for the Gunners.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at how the youngsters performed during Tuesday night's 4-1 victory...

Gedion Zelalem (17, midfielder, German) - Played 45 minutes

Minutes played: 45

Total passes: 44 (40 completed)

Pass completion rate: 90.9 per cent

Accurate forward-half passes: 15

Forward-half pass completion: 83.3 per cent 

Recoveries: 4

Fouls: 1 

The young German's introduction to this match came somewhat under the radar after he replaced Mathieu Flamini just before the half-time interval. However, he showed some promising glimpses during the second half.

He looked composed on the ball, tidy in possession, as well as strong and physical. It appears he could slot into the team seamlessly in defensive midfield - having completed 90.9 per cent of his 44 passes during the second half.

On saying that, the 17-year-old could not have asked for a better game to be introduced into with it already done and dusted at 3-0 by the time he arrived on to the field.

This was Zelalem's second appearance for the Gunners, although his first in the Champions League, having come on as a substitute during the FA Cup tie with Coventry City in January.

He is a German Under 17 international, as well as being a regular in the Arsenal Under 21 and Under 19 sides.

Zelalem could well find himself as a consistent replacement for Arsenal in a position they are severely lacking in.

Ainsley Maitland-Niles (17, winger, English) - Played 45 minutes

Minutes played: 45

Total passes: 29 (27 completed)

Pass completion rate: 93.1 per cent

Accurate forward-half passes: 8

Forward-half pass completion: 80 per cent 

Tackles: 3

Fouls: 1

Maitland-Niles came on at half-time for Aaron Ramsey to make his full professional debut having been an unused substitute in the defeat at Stoke City - and in the process he became their second-youngest ever representative in the Champions League.

Aged 17 years and 102 days, only Jack Wilshere (aged 16 years and 239 days when he made his debut) has appeared at a younger age in Europe for the Gunners.

Unfortunately for the youngster, Arsenal's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half as they eased off the gas.

Ainsley Maitland-Niles, also 17, came on for his competitive debut for Arsenal on Tuesday night

That said, he still looked extremely confident for one so young and did not look over-awed by the occasion. 

He completed a remarkable 93.1 per cent of his 29 attempted passes - including playing a couple of nice through-balls to release Joel Campbell as the game became stretched late on.

Unorthodox for a winger, but Maitland-Niles also provided an important clearance from a dangerous Galatasaray attack. He is renowned for his pace and crossing ability, but unfortunately had little-to-no opportunity to show it on Tuesday night.

Stefan O'Connor (17, defender, English) - Played 13 minutes 

Minutes played: 13

Total passes: 7 (6 completed)

Pass completion rate: 85.7 per cent

Accurate forward-half passes: 2

Forward-half pass completion: 100 per cent 

Clearances: 3

Fouls: 0 

The commanding centre back barely had an opportunity to prove how invaluable he could be to an Arsenal first team severely lacking in power and leadership.

However, for the 13 minutes he was on the field after replacing Mathieu Debuchy, O'Connor did not put a single foot wrong.

In fact, the 17-year-old made three clearances - including a vital one just before Wesley Sneijder was about to unleash a shot from the edge of the area - and contributed a few nice passes too.

He is already a regular in Arsenal's Under 21 team and has excelled in the UEFA Youth League.

O'Connor has also been capped for England at Under 17 level and is seen by Arsenal as a real defensive prospect for the future.
