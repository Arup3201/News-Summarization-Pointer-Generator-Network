The New England Patriots announced Saturday they have released the immensely popular Tim Tebow a week before the 2013 National Football League season begins.

Known as much for his faith, his charity work and for 'Tebowing,' as much as he was for his on-field performance, Tebow might have finally seen his last NFL opportunity slip through his fingers.

Tebow rose to prominence as one of the greatest quarterbacks in college football history and his outspoken Evangelical faith, which earned him the nickname ‘Mile High Messiah’ during his time with the Denver Broncos.

Already a household name before he graduated from the University of Florida after winning two national titles and the Heisman Trophy as the sport’s best player in 2007, Tebow’s candid talk about his faith and never-ending charity work converted legions of fans to ‘Tebowmania.’

Tebow was in the NFL spotlight long before he even donned a pro uniform.

The most high-profile player in college sports, Tebow often inscribed biblical verses into his eye black, such as ‘John 3:16,’ causing the term to be searched over 94 million times on Google, according to USA Today.

When told of the searches, Tebow replied ‘That just kind of showed me, wow, the impact, I could wear something under my eyes and millions of people were going to Google it. I really had a platform. I wanted to take advantage of that for one more year, be a good role model for the kids that look up to me,’ when announcing his decision to return to college for his senior year.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association soon implemented a rule against allowing messages in eye black, which media dubbed the ‘Tebow Rule.’

In a trend that started in college 
and carried over to the NFL, Tebow began every press conference by 
saying 'first I'd like to thank my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.'

Also made public in college was his firm commitment to abstinence until marriage, a pledge Tebow has kept at least until now, he's 26-years-old.

Tebow often cited bible versus 
throughout his college career. After a lopsided defeat during the 2009 
season Tebow answered a reporter's question with John 16:33.

'These
things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the 
world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer - I have overcome 
the world.'

Tebow is famous for 'Tebowing,' an act where the player dropped to one knee and prayed in the corner of the end zone after each game, became a national phenomenon and took social media by storm - with thousands taking pictures mimicking the pose everywhere imaginable.

'The greatest form of flattery is imitation, but I think that just that prayer is being talked about is pretty cool,' Tebow told ABC News.

A shocker: Many were astounded when the Denver Broncos picked Tebow 25th overall in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft

Highly successful: The draft surprise was likely the result of winning two national titles

An ad that aired during the 2010 Super Bowl featured a woman talking about how she contracted an infection during a visit to the Phillippines while pregnant. The medicine she took to beat the infection would likely harm her unborn fetus, she remembered doctors saying. Undeterred, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy not long after – that boy was Tim Tebow, who then joined his mother on camera.

Picked 25th overall by the Denver Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. Tebow was cheered by casual fans and religious devotees, but football experts doubted his ability to be a successful NFL quarterback due to an unusual throwing motion and streaky accuracy.

That the team traded away three other draft picks to get the maligned QB, mattered little to coach Josh McDaniels.

‘He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick,’ McDaniels said of Tebow.

Tebow set an NFL record before even stepping onto the field, by logging the highest draft weekend jersey sales tally in league history, according to Bloomberg.

Played sparingly his rookie season in 2010, Tebow entered halfway through the team’s fifth game of the 2011 season and almost led them to a furious comeback win. He was anointed the ‘Mile High Messiah’ when he was announced as the starter for the next game.

Trailing 15-0 with about three minutes left in the game, Tebow began one of the most improbable runs in league history by leading the team to an 18-15 overtime win over the Miami Dolphins.

Another bible verse: Though he most-often selected John 3:16, Tebow also picked other bible verses to inscribe into his eye black

The team then decisively won their next two games before miraculously pulling off three come-from-behind wins in a row and somehow putting them into the playoffs. 

The Broncos then knocked the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers out of the playoffs when Tebow threw a jaw-dropping 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime to win the game.

Amazingly, Tebow finished with 316 passing yards on 10 completions, for an NFL-record 31.6 yards per catch. Even more curiously, the numbers matched the bible verse religious signal caller often inscribed in his eye black while playing in college.

Also known for his overwhelming amount of charity work, Tebow

That would be the last touchdown pass Tim Tebow would throw in the NFL. The Broncos lost their next game and traded him to the New York Jets. Though he arrived with much fanfare, and was likely the only backup quarterback with an underwear ad over the Lincoln Tunnel, his stay in New York was short-lived – he was cut from the team at season’s end.

Last stand: Tebow playing erratically in a Patriots uniform during the 2013 preseason might be the last image of the polarizing player in the NFL

Weekly ritual: If Tebow's career is over, he ended it the same way he does every game, leading a prayer circle made up of players from both sides at the end of every game

Despite backing up a historically-inept quarterback, Tebow saw limited action and his tenure went largely unnoticed outside of a controversial church he planned to speak at and then backed away after public outcry.

Tebow signed with the New England Patriots prior to the start of training camp for the 2013 season, but with his release today – one week before the season begins – it looks like Tebowmania may finally be over, despite the maligned player’s determination to be an NFL quarterback.

During his short time with the Patriots, it was revealed by a longtime scout appearing on a Boston radio show that a Major League Baseball team was considering drafting Tim Tebow shortly after he graduated college. Which team? The (Los Angeles) Angels, or course.

Thanking the Patriots owners and coaches, Tebow tweeted Saturday afternoon to his almost 2.4million followers ‘I pray for nothing but the best for you all. I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback.'

He then, as always, ended with a bible verse. This time it was 2 Corinthians 12:9.

‘My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.’
