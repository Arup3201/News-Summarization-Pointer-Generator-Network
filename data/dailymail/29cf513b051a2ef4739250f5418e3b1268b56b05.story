Wasps are bracing themselves for protests from angry supporters on Sunday as the club play their first match since the controversial announcement that they will be moving to Coventry.

The former London club confirmed on Wednesday they will leave Adams Park in Wycombe — where they have resided for the past 12 years — and move to the Ricoh Arena in December after a multi-million purchase backed by car manufacturer Land Rover.

Many fans of Wasps, who host Bath on Sunday, are furious at the decision to relocate 80 miles north, despite promises of free coach journeys from Wycombe for future home games.

'Obviously we're expecting a mixed reaction. Moving is not a decision we've taken lightly and we'd like supporters to come on this journey with us,' said Dai Young, Wasps director of rugby.

'Moving will safeguard the future of Wasps and hopefully put Wasps back up there competing with the best in England and Europe.

'This was the only decision we could take if Wasps are to be about in the years ahead. The alternative doesn't bear thinking about

'I fail to see how any supporter would rather see their club go bust than move, although I understand their initial disappointment.

'We want to assure fans that we have looked at every option and haven't taken this decision likely. We totally value their support.'

Of gravest concern to fans has been the lack of consultation over the move and the location of the new home away from Wasps' traditional roots in London and the south east.

'Hopefully when the emotion dies down, people will take a breath and look at the reality,' Young said.

'And the reality is: do you want your club to be about in 20 or 50 years time, or do you want your club to go out of business?

'I appreciate it has been an emotional week for many supporters, but I hope we can all channel those emotions into supporting the team on the field.'
