Crystal Palace are poised to agree a £1million deal for Bolton Wanderers winger Lee Chung-yong.

The Korean is due to have a scan on his fractured leg on Monday but is expected to be given the all-clear to play soon. Palace have also asked about Middlesbrough forward Lee Tomlin.

The 26-year-old was outstanding for Boro in the recent FA Cup win over Manchester City.

Palace are also in talks with Manchester United over the permanent transfer of Wilfried Zaha for around £6m. 

Zaha started his career at Palace, scoring 18 goals in 143 games during his first spell at the club between 2009 and 2013.

Having spent time on loan back at Palace and at Cardiff City, he then returned temporarily to Selhurst Park in the summer and has scored once in 18 games.
