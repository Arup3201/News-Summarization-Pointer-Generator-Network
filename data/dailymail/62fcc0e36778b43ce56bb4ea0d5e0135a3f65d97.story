A couple who met and fell in love while playing the roles of Grumpy and Dopey in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs have become parents.

Baby Nathan was born last month and his parents, who have returned to the stage for this year's pantomime season, couldn't be more delighted.

Lisa and Nathan Whitfield have also begun to prepare their son for a life on the stage, with the baby cared for backstage during performances.

But it hasn't all been easy for the couple, who come from Sunderland, after Nathan Junior was initially diagnosed with two forms of dwarfism - a UK first - while Mrs Whitfield was still pregnant.

So severe was the initial diagnosis, she was advised to have a termination. Luckily, when the baby was born he was healthy and doctors say he will lead a normal life.

'We are so lucky,' his delighted mother said in an interview with the Sun on Sunday.

The couple have now reprised the roles they were playing when they first met, although Mrs Whitfield, 24, says she has far fewer nerves than the first time around.

Indeed, Mrs Whitfield was so shy, she was afraid to even speak to her 35-year-old future husband - despite the instant attraction.

'When I first saw Nathan playing Grumpy, my heart skipped a beat,' she revealed. 'I'd never seen anyone so handsome and I instantly fancied him.

'I got butterflies in my stomach the first time I went into rehearsal and saw him.'

Luckily for the enamoured Mrs Whitfield, now husband Nathan felt the same way and the couple got engaged in April last year.

'I never imagined he would look twice at me,' added a thrilled Mrs Whifield. 'We are so lucky.'
