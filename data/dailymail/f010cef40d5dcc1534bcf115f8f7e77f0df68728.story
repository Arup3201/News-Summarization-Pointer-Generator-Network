These remarkable images show scores of homes and businesses left devastated by recent floods.

Numerous properties in the rural areas of Thorney, Muchelney and Burrowbridge in Somerset were hit with up to four feet of water when the nearby River Parrett burst its banks on January 2.

Last night, following another night of heavy rain, the water levels increased again by four inches.

These pictures show homes and businesses in rural Somerset which have been hit with up to four ft of floodwater since the new year

The stunning images, including this one of a horse rider braving floodwater, were taken by photographer Matilda Temperley whose family live and work in the area

Due to high water levels in surrounding rivers and sodden ground, the floodwater is yet to show any sign of subsiding across the area known as the Somerset Levels.

In the collection of images, residents can be seen walking down flooded roads and wading outside their now submerged homes.

Locals have even used canoes to get around, with some forced to use a small boat to get their children to school - which is 
thought cost around Â£1,000 a day.

Meanwhile, hundreds of acres of water-locked farm land can be seen - with sandbags doing little to stop the continually rising water.

In another, a tractor is left abandoned under several feet of water.

But perhaps some of the most stark images are of Thorney House - which belongs to 98-year-old Professor Temperley.

Having lived in the home almost all 
of his life, the professor was evacuated from the beautiful late 19th 
century property on New Years Day.

The following day his home was flooded - leaving the home's interior completely devastated.

The Temperleys say it could take months to get the house back in order.

The stunning collection of images were taken by professor's granddaughter Matilda - more of her work can be viewed here.

She
 said: 'We have never seen anything like this. My grandfather - having 
lived here for 98 years - has never seen anything like this.

'Once
 the waters go, we will start a huge clean-up operation. We don't really
 know how long it will take or how much it will cost.'

The professional photographer took the shots over the past week.

She said the area was hit by terrible floods last year - but this latest bout could spell ruin for many local businesses.

Ms Temperley added: 'The river hasn't been dredged for almost 20 years and it is having a terrible affect.

'Many
 business people are worried they will now have to pay huge overheads or 
won't get insured because this is the second year we have had flooding.

'Last
 years' floods, according to the Environment Agency, were the worst in 
100 years. They said it was a 100-year event but this year has been 
worse.'

Matilda's father 
Julian is the owner of the Somerset Cider Brandy Company, which is located next to the professor's home. A barn where 
barrels of cider are kept is shown in some of the images.

Luckily Mr Temperley managed to save all of his barrels from this years' floods.

He too said the problem was due to the fact the river had not be dredged for over 20 years.

He said: 'We managed to get everything out. We lost a tractor but it was sacrificed for good reason.

'The river hasn't been dredged for 20 years and it looks like it is going to stay that way.

'We have a real problem here in Somerset now. We are used to flooding but this has just got out of control.'
