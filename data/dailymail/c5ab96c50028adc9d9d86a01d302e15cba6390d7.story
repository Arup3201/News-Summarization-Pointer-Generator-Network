With shouts, cheers and fireworks, Seattle Seahawks fans celebrated a dominant victory in the Super Bowl - the city's first major sports championship in more than 30 years.

As the team beat Denver Broncos 43-8, a swarm of fans who had been watching it in the West Coast city swarmed across the city, clambering on buildings and pounding on passing cars.

The city quickly descended into chaos as 3,000 revelers swamped the city, climbing on buildings, smashing glass and ripped down street signs.

Anticipating rowdy celebrations, the 
city's police had earlier tweeted a warning that they would be 'making 
sure everyone is celebrating safely'.

Police dressed in riot gear were patrolling the streets, with an anticipated 3,000 fans expected to party all night.

In downtown Seattle there were reports of people dancing on top of cars and the News Tribune reported hearing bangs, but said it couldn't tell if it was fireworks or celebratory gunfire.

Some revelers dismantled street signs around Pioneer Square and burned a Broncos hat as the riotous celebrations continued.

The city's historic pergola, a glass-roofed structure built in 1909, was feared damaged after hordes started clambering over the fragile building, and smashing its roof, Kiro7 News reported.

By the early hours of Monday, only one arrest had been reported, after a fan fired celebratory gunfire in his yard.

A 60-year-old man was arrested, described as slightly intoxicated, was arrested for discharging a weapon within the city limits, and a shotgun was impounded after neighbors complained in Bellingham.

The evening had started with fans of both teams feeling they were in with a chance of victory.

But in one of the most one-sided Super Bowls in history, watched on by an array of A-list celebrities, Seattle Seahawks supporters soon realised it was going to be their day.

In New York, where several blocks around Times Square have been hosting Super Bowl events, the Empire State building glowed green, and fans in the team's colors partied in the street.

The last time a major Seattle sports franchise won a championship was in 1979 when the Supersonics took the NBA title.

'The 12th Man are very vocal, very passionate fans, but they don't get out of control. And we don't expect that to change, but we are prepared and we do have a plan,' Seattle police spokesman Mark Jamieson said.

Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement that an official Seahawks victory parade would happen at 11am Wednesday.

But Wednesday was too far away for 
the thousands of fans who had cheered the Seahawks to victory from bars 
and venues across Seattle.

Dramatic footage from the city center showed a swelling crowd yelling and filling a busy road after the Sunday night win.

With yells and car horns blaring, the crowd surrounded one vehicle and pounded on its roof and sides as they celebrated.

Other
 fans set fire to bonfires in parks and streets, as a night of rowdy 
celebrations got under way. In the University District, near the 
University of Washington, fire crews extinguished at least one bonfire 
shortly after the victory.

Senayet Woldemarian, a 29-year-old physical therapist, shrieked giddily and waved her Seahawks flag at honking cars on a North Seattle street: 'We got our first Super Bowl!'

Her friend, Taylor Olcott, 28, said it reminded her a little of being in Boston in 2004, when the Red Sox won baseball's World Series for the first time since 1918.

'This is the first time I've really seen Seattle passionate about anything,' she said. 'It's very exciting.'

'We're all in euphoria right now,' Steve McVay, 43, said. 'It's a huge deal for the city. Since the Sonics we haven't won anything.'

John Caro and his wife, Corina, both 59, whooped their way down Lake City Way in North Seattle, high-fiving passersby.

'This is my ultimate dream!' Caro shouted. 'We have waited so freakin' long for this!'

There was an altogether different mood in Denver, as fans turned in for an early night after their team's crushing defeat.

Denver Police had braced for trouble, but the Bronco's loss and icy weather - it was well below freezing when the game ended - worked together to keep the mood subdued.

Near downtown, a man was shot and critically injured in the street near a home where he had attended a Super Bowl party, but it wasn't known if the shooting was related to the party, police spokesman Sonny Jackson said.

It was a far cry from 1999, when the Broncos beat the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. Celebrations deteriorated into violence. Crowds smashed downtown Denver store windows and overturned cars.

On Sunday, some news outlets switched quickly from game coverage to previews of the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi or focused on top Super Bowl commercials.
