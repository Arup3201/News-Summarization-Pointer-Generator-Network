Despite going a goal down when Eden Hazard put the Blues ahead from the penalty spot, Liverpool were very much the better side in the second half of this fixture. Raheem Sterling helped the Reds to take a draw into the semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge.

DOMINIC KING provides an assessment of each player at Anfield.

LIVERPOOL (3-4-3)

Simon Mignolet – Largely untroubled; one good clearance to thwart Costa, sent the wrong way for Chelsea penalty – 6.5 

Emre Can – Allowed Fabregas to put in a tangle and then compounded his error by flattening Hazard for the spot kick – 6

Emre Can had a night to forget when he clumsily fouled Chelsea star Eden Hazard to concede a penalty

Liverpool hard man Martin Skrtel made some good interceptions and was solid in the tackle for the Reds

Martin Skrtel – Doesn’t shirk a battle with Diego Costa and, in the main, he was solid, no real errors of note – 7

Mamadou Sakho – Beginning to make himself a fixture in this team, not an elegant defender but gets his job done – 7

Jordan Henderson – Growing in stature, used the ball well. Didn’t shirk the issue when Costa squared up to him in second half – 7

Steven Gerrard – A couple of superb passes, one tackle that rattled Felipe Luis and a shot that forced Courtois into evasive action – 8

Jordan Henderson showed he is man enough for the job in a mature performance against Chelsea 

Lucas Leiva – Booked for clattering into Hazard; did all that was expected of him, is in a rich vein form – 7

Alberto Moreno – Had the first chance of the game when powering onto a Sakho pass; solid rather than spectacular – 7

Lazar Markovic – Has shown persistence and courage to get a run in the team and those qualities were again evident here – 6.5

Raheem Sterling – Burst to life in the second half with a fabulous goal, showing speed and skill to sweep his drive away – 8

Philippe Coutinho – Heavily involved early on, some of his passing was superb. Always threat on the ball – 7.5

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard played a pivotal part in his side's Capital One Cup first-leg draw at Anfield

Ward (GK), Enrique, Lambert, Manquillo, Lallana, Borini, Rossiter

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers – Kept tweaking the system Liverpool were using to exploit Chelsea’s vulnerable areas – 7.5

Raheem Sterling made a wonderful run to slalom his way through the Chelsea defence to score the equaliser

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Thibaut Courtois – Returned from a three-game absence to make three outstanding saves from Gerrard, Lallana and Coutinho – 8.5

Branislav Ivanovic – Has scored a few key goals against Liverpool in his time but the onus here was very much on keeping them out – 7

Thibaut Courtois was the best player on the pitch after keeping out Liverpool's second half onslaught

Gary Cahill – A couple of crucial interventions early on but left floundering when Sterling sped past him to level – 6

John Terry – His type of game, kept Chelsea’s defence together when Liverpool turning the screw in the second half – 7

Felipe Luis – Didn’t know what had hit him when Gerrard thundered into dispossess him; found it hard going – 6

Chelsea captain John Terry gets himself into a bit of a tangle with Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling 

Nemanja Matic – Magnificent on his last two visits to Anfield but didn’t quite have the impact this time around – 6.5

Jon Obi Mikel – Works hard but doesn’t tend to offer much else; never an influence on the ball – 5.5

Eden Hazard – Makes the game look easy at times and converted his penalty beautifully; not involved enough to really hurt Liverpool – 7

Eden Hazard was in typical spritely form and managed to put the Blues ahead from the penalty spot 

Cesc Fabregas – Been magnificent since returning to the Premier League; the reason Chelsea got their penalty with a mazy run – 7

Willian – A typical Mourinho player; has great skill and speed but never shies away from putting in the hard yards – 7

Diego Costa – Had a barging match with Skrtel, squabbled with Henderson, didn’t threaten Liverpool’s goal – 6

It was a frustrating game for Chelsea striker Diego Costa, who failed to register a shot on target

SUBS

Cesar Azpilicueta (for Willian 88 minutes)

Cech (GK), Zouma, Oscar, Drogba, Remy,

MANAGER

Jose Mourinho – Won’t be too disheartened by this result but wasn’t impressed by some of his players – 7
