A Hawaii-based Army explosives expert shattered the world female record for fastest mile run in a fully functional 75 pound bomb disposal suit.

1st Lieutenant Ashley Sorensen beat the record by over two minutes when she ran a full mile in the suit in 11 minutes and six seconds.

Lieutenant Sorensen trained for a year and a half for the feat of strength and endurance, which could serve her in the field even more than it boosts her admirable reputation.

Sorensen’s full title is 1st Lieutenant of the 303rd Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, 8th Military Police Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command. And as bulky as the title sounds, it doesn’t have nearly the heft of the bomb suit, called an EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal).

‘Whenever EOD goes out in the bomb suits for a manual approach, it's really important that we're able to work and sweat in the suit and still be able perform, so making it a competition when we train helps with that. Running a mile like this is definitely a challenge,’ said the 1st Lieutenant, who is her unit’s executive officer.

Her 18 months of training paid off Monday as throngs of her colleagues piled onto the bleachers at the University of Hawaii-Manoa track to watch her make the attempt.

Sorenson briefly warmed up beforehand, wearing bright pink—an unassuming hue for a woman about to haul 75 pounds of bomb-proof gear for a mile in Hawaii heat.

The impressive lady quickly removed the EOD suit once her record run was over, but she was eager to convey her excitement after catching her breath.

‘We finally did it, it feels awesome, and I really appreciate everybody coming out for it,’ she said.

According to Hawaii News Now, Sorensen compared the run to the grueling last few miles of a marathon.

review.

Explosive ordnance disposal experts like 1st Lieutenant Sorenson are a first line of defense between roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices and soldiers in the theater of war.

According to GoArmy.com, they are the preeminent tactical and technical explosives experts.

They are warriors who are properly trained, equipped and integrated to attack, defeat and exploit unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and weapons of mass destruction. 

They're impressive list of skills includes:

The EOD suits use high-tech ceramics and other shielding material in order to protect soldiers from potential explosions.

High impact glass covers the face of EOD specialists. The soldier must be protected head to toe because, unlike projectiles, an explosive blast can impact the entire body, hence the necessity of bulky suits like Sorensen's.

Champion: Sorensen will enter the Guinness Book of World Records pending an official review of her impressive run
