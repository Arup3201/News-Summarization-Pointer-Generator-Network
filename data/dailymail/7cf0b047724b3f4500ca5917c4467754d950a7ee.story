The two-page note starts saying: ‘Dear Taylor, How’s life? Life is pretty simple 10 years in your past,’ according to CBS11.

‘Congratulations on graduating high school, if you didn't, go back and keep trying, get that degree…Do you have your own place yet? If we're in college what are we majoring in? Right now I want to be a lawyer.’

She goes on to write: ‘Remember it's been 10 years since I wrote this. Stuff has happened good and bad, that's just how life works and you have to go with it.’

The girl was religious and in the note she reminded her future self to go to church.
