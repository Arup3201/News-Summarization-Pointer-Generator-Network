A mother says she fears her daughter's addiction to eating carpets and fabric will eventually kill her.

Four-year-old Charlotte Cook suffers from autism and the disorder Pica, which makes her want to eat fabric items.

She regularly chews on sofas, carpets and cuddly toys to satisfy her cravings.

Damage: Charlotte regularly chews on sofas, carpets and cuddly toys to satisfy her cravings - much to her mother Nikki's despair

Doctors have been unable to treat her for the disorder and her worried mother Nikki claims the family are not getting any support.

Pica is characterised by an appetite for substances with very few nutrients, such as ice, clay, chalk, materials, dirt, or sand.

It affects around 30 per cent of children with autism and can cause choking, digestive problems and parasitic infections.

Experts say it can be caused by a mineral or iron deficiency but it is also classed as a psychiatric disorder.

Mrs Cook, 42, said: 'My biggest worry is that it will get clogged up somewhere and kill her.

'It's
 like an addiction. She has to do it. The sofas cost Â£2,700 but 
Charlotte has ruined them all, along with the scatter cushions.

Mrs Cook added: 'She picks the fabric out with her teeth and swallows it. My biggest worry is that it will get clogged up somewhere and kill her'

Problem: Charlotte has also started to chew her favourite cuddly toys

'She picks the fabric out with her teeth and swallows it.

'She has started chewing the arm of the sofa and her cuddly toys as well - which she needs to have or else she has a massive meltdown.

'She also tries to eat the TV remote and her car seat.  The problem is she doesn't realise she is doing it. We feel so alone with this.'

 Between
 10 and 30 per cent of children aged between one and six have pica - an 
eating disorder which is characterised by cravings for non-food items.

The disorder is most common in people with developmental disorders, such as autism.

It is also common in children between the ages of two and three and in those who have suffered a brain injury.

People
 with pica frequently crave and eat items such as dirt, paint, chalk, 
clay, coffee grounds, cigarette butts, hair and sand.The condition can sometimes result in serious health problems, such as lead poisoning.

Mrs Cook and her husband Alasdair were stunned after Charlotte began eating carpets in the family home when she was just a year old.

Around the same time, she also started to show the first signs of autism.

Mrs Cook, from Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, said: 'We always knew that something wasn't quite right with Charlotte.

'We had a big green rug in the front room and when she was a year old she started eating it.

'I told the health visitor about it and she said to take the rug out of the room.

'We thought that would be the end, of it but she gradually started doing it with the carpet in her own room. 

'Then she started going into her sister's room and doing it there. Around October last year, she started with the sofas.'

Experts have struggled to find a solution to the unusual problem, leaving Mr and Mrs Cook to fear for their daughter's health.

One expert suggested removing all fabric items from the house - an option which family can't afford.

Mrs Cook, who works as a self-employed sports therapist, said: 'We have told her calmly that she can't do it or she will be sick but that has no effect. We have tried everything. 

'All the doctors have told us is that if she gets a high temperature or goes limp to take her straight to A&E. That's what we are dealing with on a daily basis.

Her mother added: 'It's like an addiction, she has to do it. The sofas cost Â£2,700 but Charlotte has ruined them all, along with the scatter cushions'

'I can't begin to explain how much of a worry it is.'

The family are now trying to raise awareness of the condition in the hope of finding a way to help Charlotte.

Mrs Cook, who is also mother to Evelyn, six, added: 'Alasdair and I work hard, but there is no help out there. 

'We can't afford to replace the sofas or the carpet because there's no assistance for working parents.

'We want to make people aware of the condition because it is rarely publicised.

'Some people make me feel as if Charlotte is a freak but she is my daughter and I would do anything for her.'
