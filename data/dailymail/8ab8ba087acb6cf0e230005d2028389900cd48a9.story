When environmentalist Laura spotted an articulate and well-built eco warrior sitting opposite her at a meeting of anarchists, she was touched by how he appeared ‘the perfect blueprint’ for the kind of man she was looking for.

Others in that North London pub told how Jim Sutton had for five years waged an anarchic war as a hunt saboteur, been pivotal at anti-GM food protests and even travelled to Rome for a weekend of demonstrations.

These were, the young woman thought, the impressive credentials of a dedicated environmental campaigner. 

Deceit: Met officer James Boyling (left) married an activist, and Bob Lambert (right) used the name Robinson

A month later, they met in another pub and Laura and Sutton became lovers. The following year they moved in together in a flat and began what she thought was ‘a blissfully in love relationship’.

But, as the months went by, Laura began to realise that this reserved man did not seem as committed or as knowledgeable about ‘the cause’ as she had first thought.

Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that ‘Sutton’ was in fact James Boyling, 43, an undercover officer who had infiltrated anarchist and hard-line environmental groups to glean intelligence and disrupt their activities. He began working undercover in the mid-1990s after serving in the Met’s anti-terrorism unit.

Senior police also named Bob Lambert, an undercover officer who used the name Bob Robinson and who fathered a son with a female activist before later abandoning them.

The decision formally to name the officers follows a ruling by a High Court judge who said the Met could no longer hide behind its insistence that it could ‘neither confirm nor deny’ the identities of the men at the centre of allegations brought by women claiming they were ‘tricked’ into having sexual relationships with officers. 

The Met claimed its policy was for the safety of officers working undercover.

It is the latest twist in an ever-more controversial legal dispute centring on the police’s use of undercover officers and the tactics they employ with women in particular.

The woman who had a child with Lambert – who prefers only to be named as Jacqui – told the Mail yesterday that she suspected undercover officers used sex as a ‘tactical option’. She is currently bringing a legal claim against the Met.

‘I will never know if Bob Lambert’s “feelings” for me were “genuine” whilst we were in a relationship, as the police now say they were, but with hindsight, that must be irrelevant,’ she said.

‘What is significant is Lambert’s reasons for entering into the relationship with me and his reasons for ending it and leaving me to bring up our son alone. I believe that I was used, that I was just a tactical option and part of their operation.’

Lambert, who had infiltrated animal rights groups, was said to have had sexual relations with four women, including Jacqui, whom he met at an animal rights party. That was in the 1980s, and he left her when their son was two.

Holes: Boyling's wife said holes began to emerge in his political views and started becoming reserved

He is also the detective named by barrister Mark Ellison’s review of the Stephen Lawrence murder case. Ellison wrote that he was one of three officers alleged to have been involved in a plot to gather ‘fascinating and valuable intelligence’ from an undercover officer who was spying on the Lawrence family and their supporters.

Jules Carey of Bindmans solicitors, which represents Jacqui, along with other women bringing claims against the Met, said the decision to name officers would do little to restore public confidence in the force. There are currently ten women seeking compensation, with claims against four officers for deceit, assault, negligence and malfeasance in public office.

This begs the question of whether an undercover officer who has sex with members of the group he has infiltrated is, as Jacqui claims, employing a tactical option, simply sees it as a ‘perk’ of the job or, as the Met says, is merely succumbing to genuine feelings of mutual attraction.

To understand how officers can become so involved with women, you must comprehend how consuming living a double life can be. They are each provided with a ‘legend’ or cover story. Senior officers last year admitted that the identities of dead babies had even been used.

The police spies get a passport and credit cards, as well as generous funds to be able to bribe people. They are also given a telephone with a tracking device so handlers can always trace them if they get into trouble. Lambert recently admitted appearing in a magistrates’ court for a ‘minor public offence’, but used his fake name to maintain cover.

But is pairing off with a girlfriend from within the group they are infiltrating essential to their cover?

In an interview with the Guardian, Laura said she began to question Boyling’s commitment to the cause while they were living as a couple. He showed a lack of commitment, she said, to environmental campaigns.

He was, she said, ‘under-developed ideologically’ and there were ‘holes in his political development’. His increasingly reserved behaviour led to him being called ‘Grumpy Jim’.

Also, his almost military attention to cleaning his boots led Laura to ponder whether he was in fact an imposter. He later announced he was leaving to hitchhike to South Africa. He vanished, perhaps to return to a desk in Scotland Yard.

Tactics? The women Lambert and Boyling duped question whether they were tactical or 'a perk of the job'

She tried tracking him down, and the pair met by chance in a bookshop, where he admitted to being a police officer. Despite this revelation, they maintained a relationship while living apart and had two children.

They married in 2005 but divorced a few years later. Boyling remains a serving officer in the Met.

Yesterday, another woman who had a relationship with an undercover officer, Helen Steel, rounded on the suggestion that officers had affairs because of genuine feelings.

‘It’s a load of rubbish,’ she said. ‘How can you have a genuine relationship that’s based on a complete web of lies? They knew that their posting was going to be ending in just a few years, and that they were going to disappear from our lives and leave us bereft. That’s not love – that is abuse.’

This former anti-capitalist protester with London Greenpeace said her world ‘fell apart’ after she discovered her former partner had a fake identity.

Mr Carey says: ‘The compelling body of evidence that police officers systematically used sexual relationships with women to build their cover stories contradicts the “rogue officer in love myth” that is being offered to the public.’

Until these emotionally-charged legal battles have been resolved, it remains to be seen whether the police will regret giving Boyling a letter of commendation while he was an undercover officer for his ‘outstanding devotion to duty and determination over extended period in the investigation of serious crime’.
