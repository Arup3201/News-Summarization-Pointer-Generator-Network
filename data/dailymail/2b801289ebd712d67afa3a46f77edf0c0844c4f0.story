'Gentle giant': Todd Williams, a former offensive tackle for the Tennessee Titans, was found dead in a Bradenton hotel Monday after complaining of stomach pain

Former Tennessee Titans offensive tackle Todd Williams was found dead in a Florida hotel Monday morning after suffering from a mysterious illness. He was 35 years old.

Williams' body was discovered by sheriff’s deputies in Bradenton. Officials say there was no evidence of foul play. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.

According to the former NFL star's mother, Ozepher Fluker,  Williams had been suffering of stomach pain for a month and lost his sense of taste.

Miss Fluker advised her son to go to a hospital last Friday to undergo tests, Bradenton Herald reported.

After being unable to reach her son over the weekend, Miss Fluker headed to the Sarasota Suites hotel in Bradenton, where her unwed, childless son called home for the past six years.

The 6-foot-5, 330-pound football player was pronounced dead at around 11.15am when Manatee County Sheriff's deputies responded to the inn on North Tamiami Trail.

Williams got a rough start in life and was able overcome adversity thanks to his athletic ability.

Sarasota Herald Tribune reported that in 1993, his grandmother and caretaker died from diabetes complications. The following year, Williams’ estranged father was murdered on his way to meet his son for the very first time.

The teen was determined to stay out of
 the foster care system, so he ran away to Miami and lived on the 
streets, stealing to survive and breaking into cars for shelter. 

He
 later returned home to Bradenton, got an apartment and went on to play 
football at Southeast High School. To support himself, the teen worked 
part time at a local grocery store.

His
 former offensive coach, Dave Marino, recalled how he would bring 
Williams home after practice and pay him for mowing his lawn so the teen
 could earn some extra money for basic necessities.

After
 graduating high school, Williams went to Florida State University on a 
football scholarship, and he was on the 1999 team that won the national 
championship.

Sad end: Williams was found dead at the Sarasota Suites hotel in Bradenton, where he had lived for the last six years

In 2002, Williams won the NCAA's Inspirational Athlete of the Year Award and graduated with degrees in sociology and criminology.

The following year, he was drafted by the Tennessee Titans as a seventh-round pick and played a total of seven games before the team waived him in 2005.

After returning to Bradenton, the retired NFL star worked at Manatee Y Technical High School as a social studies teacher. 

Hoping to help troubled kids like himself, Williams sponsored a sports club every other Thursday. He was planning to launch intramural football this spring.

For the last month, Williams suffered from severe health issues, his mother said.

‘He said, “Momma, I feel worse than I have ever felt in my whole life,"’ said Fluker, recalling her last conversation with her son Friday.

‘He said, “Momma, I can't stop vomiting. I don't have a taste. I cannot eat. I don't want to smell food. I am weak and I want to go to the hospital."’
