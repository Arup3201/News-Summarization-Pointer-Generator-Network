From their childhood bedroom to their first day at work and even their wedding day, these identical twin sisters have shared a lifetime.

So Christine and Carol Coxe, who wore matching wedding gowns to marry their husbands in a double celebration on the same day in 1963, were determined their golden wedding anniversary celebrations should be no different - even though Carol was tragically widowed in 2011.

Christine, from Mountain Ash in Wales, and her husband Ken Williams marked the milestone anniversary with a holiday along with Christine's sister - just as the inseparable foursome would have done when Carol's husband Robert was alive.

After marrying on the same day in Treharris, south Wales, the twins went on to have their first children within a week of each other.

When the sisters reached 50, they both decided to take early retirement and the foursome began travelling the world together.

Mrs Williams, 69, said she was determined to be there for her sister when Robert passed away 18 months ago, and she and her husband have taken twin Carol on a string of trips to mark their joint 50th wedding anniversary.

'We’ve done everything together - grew up, got married, 
worked together and had children all at the same time,' she said.

'We are as close as sisters could be. We have hardly spent a day apart in our lives.

'Holidays were very special for us as couples - we’ve been around the world together as the four of us.

'When we reached our 50th birthday we both retired early and decided the four of us would do lots of travelling.

'We have been to so many lovely places together - Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Majorca, Turkey, Tenerfife, Australia, Canada and Singapore.

'We have so many beautiful memories of happy times.

'We’ve absolutely no regrets about anything - we’ve both had great lives with two wonderful husbands.

'It was so heartbreaking when Carol lost Robert.

'For the first time in our lives there was a big difference in our lives.

'She misses him so much. So when it was our golden wedding it was sad Robert was not here with us - and we had to make sure my sister was still sharing our lives.

'So we’ve all been on holiday together five times to our holiday caravan in West Wales in the last year. It’s been fabulous.

'Carol and I don’t spend a lot of time apart - in fact lots of our family live on the same street,' Mrs Williams said.

The sisters said it was their father’s 'proudest moment' as he walked down the aisle with a teenage daughter on each arm on their wedding day in 1963.

Christine had been due to get married earlier after Ken proposed when they were 17.

But they decided to wait so her father Ninian Coxe could walk both sisters down the aisle on the same day.

Robert popped the question to Carol soon after - and they shared their dream double wedding at St Mathias Church in Treharris, South Wales.

Christine said: 'Our wedding day was the proudest day of our father’s life. He always wished he could walk us both down the aisle.'

They wore matching knee-length white gowns and veils, and carried the same red rose andcarnation bouquets.

And the girls' husbands quickly became firm friends.

A year later, the sisters gave birth to their first children just a week apart.

Christine said: 'As children you couldn’t tell who was who. We can’t even tell when we look at pictures of ourselves.

'We
almost know what the other one is thinking. One day we went shopping 
separately and came home with exactly the same coat in different 
colours.

'Carol comes on holiday with me and Ken. In the last year we’ve been away five times together.

'Our family has always been very close. Our children and grandchildren feel the same, too,' she said.

Carol and Christine also worked side-by-side for much of their lives.

They both worked at a factory before opening a shop, and today they still run a weekly coffee morning at their local community centre.

Carol said: 'We have lived our lives side by side and done everything together.

'Falling in love, our wedding, our babies - we’ve done them all at the same time. So we had to share our golden wedding anniversary with some lovely holidays away.

'Robert was a big part of our lives. The four of us were always together wherever we went.

'We’ve always been on holidays together - in Australia and Canada. They were our most memorable times together.

'Now we are planning to have a trip just the two of us in Benidorm or London.

'It’s going to be our 70th birthday this year so that will be another celebration.

'I miss Robert so much but it makes it so much easier to share my time with my sister and her husband.'
