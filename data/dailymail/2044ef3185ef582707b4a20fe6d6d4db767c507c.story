Graham Daniels, the head teacher at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe in Swansea is no longer at the helm while an alleged 'sex tape' recorded in the school is investigated

A headteacher has been relieved of his duties after a video emerged on YouTube that allegedly captures the sound of people engaged in sexual activity at a secondary school in Wales.

Governors at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bryn Tawe in Swansea have announced that the deputy headteacher has been placed in charge temporarily after the video emerged, replacing headteacher Graham Daniels, 50.

The 34-second clip shows a red-carpeted administrative area with several closed wooden doors.

It appears to be recorded outside an office at the school and noises of a seemingly sexual nature can be heard from the other side of the door.

It is not known when the clip was filmed and whether it is genuine but it was shared on social media sites including YouTube where it was viewed hundreds of times before being removed.

A council spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Daniels was suspended or voluntarily stepped down.

He declined to comment on the 'sex tape' recorded by pupils at his school.

The headteacher was not at his detached bungalow in Ammanford, West Wales, today.

His wife Heledd, 50, answered the door of their £350,000 home, with a private drive and sweeping views of a picturesque wooded valley.

The mother-of-three said her husband was out and said she did not want to speak about the case.

But Mr Daniels later answered his mobile phone and said: 'I do not wish to comment.'

Governors at the school, which teaches pupils between the ages of 11 and 18 have launched an investigation.

They are studying the video, now taken off Youtube, to discover who was in the office at the time.

A special assembly has been held at Bryn Tawe School in Swansea to tell pupils to ignore the video and focus on their exams.

They have been told there is an external investigation underway and the matter will be dealt with 'in the fairest way possible'.

Pupils have been sharing the 30-second video on social networking websites including Facebook and Twitter.

But
 they have now been banned from talking about it on Twitter and Facebook
 after being accused of 'damaging the school's reputation'.

Dozens of 
postings on social media sites refer to the video, with one poster 
writing on Twitter: 'I literally can’t believe this! Sounds like a soap 
opera!'

Parents have also been left outraged after their children showed them the clip.

One angry father said: 'I am seriously considering moving my children from the school. The audio of the alleged sex act was taped by a pupil and is now a Facebook sensation.

'It has been shared with a number of pupils and parents have made a complaint after seeing it.

'Pupils have been asked to delete the video but this needs to be publicised to ensure the matter is not covered up.'

School chair of governors Heini Gruffudd said: 'The school has received a complaint which did not name anyone involved.

'Following this the governing body is holding an investigation in co-operation with the local authority.

'Mr Simon Davies, currently deputy headteacher at the school, will be managing the school for the time being.

'The school is running normally and we won’t be commenting further at this time.'

A Swansea Council spokesman last week said it would be 'inappropriate to comment' on the claims.

The school’s latest Estyn report, following an inspection in March last year, saw Bryn Tawe handed a rare ‘double-excellent’.

The Welsh-medium secondary school, which has around 750 pupils on roll, was praised by inspectors who described the quality and consistency of teaching at the institution as 'exceptional features'.

The school, which opened in 2003, was last September ranked the top school in Wales

Pupils’ behaviour was also applauded while inspectors said the prospects for continued improvement were excellent.

The report added: 'The vision and strategic direction provided by the headteacher is excellent, with a clear and sustained focus on maintaining and achieving high standards.

'The headteacher is supported by an enthusiastic senior management team.

'The effect of the senior management team’s work permeates every aspect of school life.

'They are extremely good line managers who insist upon high and consistent expectations.'

The school, which opened in 2003, was last September ranked the top school in Wales as part of league table rankings compiled by WalesOnline.
