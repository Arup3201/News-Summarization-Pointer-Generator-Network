An blind dog has been rescued after being found in hanging in a ‘cocoon’ from a palm tree in a mangrove forest in south Florida.

Residents spotted a dog wrapped in a ‘cocoon-like structure’ made from duct tape that had been nailed to a tree in southwest Miami-Dade County.

Witnesses believe the male chihuahua had been subjected to a voodoo-like ritual as the animal was surrounded by bones.

'Voodoo': Angel the blind chihuahua was spotted handing from a tree in a cocoon made from duct tape

The blind dog, which has now been named Angel, was rescued by Miami-Dade Animal Services in Black Point Marina, Miami on Tuesday.

Officers found Angel running free and hiding in the mangroves, however, residents claim the dog had previously been hanging from a tree.

‘On the edge of the forest, we found duct tape hanging from a nail and the evidence sort of points to the fact that the dog was covered in duct tape in like a cocoon and nailed to the back of a palm tree,’ resident Bill Flett told NBC Miami.

Residents believe Angel had been subjected to a Santeria ritual, and animal bones were found at the scene

In recovery: Angel is now in the care of Miami-Dade Animal Services and is recovering from his ordeal

‘All over this place are bones and I was told by some experts that I spoke with that it’s probably Santeria because there’s a bunch of dead bones and the way the dog was hung in the sack of made of duct tape up on the tree’.

Santeria is a syncretic Afro-Caribbean religion which has some similarities to Voodoo.

Santeria, also known as La Regla Lucumi and the Rule of Osha, is based on Yoruba beliefs and traditions and traditions, with some Roman Catholic elements added.

Animal sacrifice is central to Santeria, a religion which is thought to have grown out of the slave trade in Cuba.

Miami-Dade Animal Services say Angel is recovering well and will be put up for adoption unless an owner comes forward.
