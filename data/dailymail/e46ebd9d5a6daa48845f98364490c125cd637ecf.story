The campaign for Scotland to break away from the rest of the UK has suffered a devastating blow with a fewer than one in four people backing independence.

Support for Alex Salmond’s dream of going it alone is now at its lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999.

Experts claim increased publicity for the SNP’s campaign to leave the UK has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean.

Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999

Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed.

It
shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported 
independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are 
‘quite’ or ‘very’ worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in 
2011.

Mr Salmond has secured a deal with David Cameron to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014.

Rachel
Ormston, director of ScotCen Social Research, an independent 
not-for-profit group which produced the survey, said: ‘The 'yes' 
campaign still needs to convince a much wider section of the public that
independence will bring real benefits, especially for Scotland's 
economy.’

The survey will be a major blow to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who last year struck a deal with David Cameron to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014

Scots will be denied a vote on membership of the EU if they choose independence, it emerged last night.

Alex Salmond will refuse voters a say on whether they want to leave the EU if he wins the referendum on Scottish independence.

The First Minister has ruled out an in-out referendum or a vote on the terms of any deal that Scotland strikes before joining the EU as a separate country.

Prime Minister David Cameron has offered an in-out referendum by 2017 after renegotiating a new deal with Brussels, but Scots will only be able to take part if there is a No vote in the independence poll.

Mr Salmond will ask Scots to vote for independence – which he says would include joining the EU – without knowing the terms of membership. That means Scotland could be saddled with a raw deal over the EU budget and border controls or be forced to commit to the euro.

However, the survey also revealed many Scots are confused about the powers that the Holyrood parliament has, and want it to be responsible for most of Scotland's domestic affairs.

More than half want Holyrood to set taxes while almost two-thirds said it should set welfare benefits. Just 6 per cent would want to return all decision-making powers to London.

If independence is achieved, 42 per cent think Scotland would have a stronger voice in the world - down from 51 per cent in 2011.

Those who think it would make no difference changed from 27 per cent to 32 per cent.

On the economy, about a third think it will be better while the same number disagree.

About one in five would be confident about Scotland's future, compared with 31 per cent in 2011.

Elections expert Professor John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde who worked on the survey, said: ‘During the course of the last 12 months the independence debate moved firmly to the top of the Scottish political agenda.

‘Yet the proponents of independence have apparently struggled to capitalise on the resulting opportunity to persuade Scots of the merits of their case.

‘Instead, more voters appear to have become concerned about the prospect of leaving the UK.’

Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond was 'failing spectacularly' to persuade people of the merits of separation

Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: ‘This survey shows Alex Salmond is failing spectacularly to sell his dream of separation to the people of Scotland, who are growing increasingly sceptical about the concept.’

A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘We have already set out our vision for the country we would like Scotland to be - a country that earns its wealth and shares it more fairly; a country where every child has the chance to grow up and fulfil their potential.

‘During this year the Scottish Government will outline the compelling case for independence, leading to a white paper in the autumn that will set out the Government's proposals for how that independent Scotland will look.’

The researchers interviewed a sample of 1,229 adults face-to-face between July and November 2012.
