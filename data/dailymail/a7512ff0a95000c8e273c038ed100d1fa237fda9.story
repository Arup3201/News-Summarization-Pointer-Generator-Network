Tempers flared at Heathrow yesterday after the airport became a ‘refugee camp’ when hundreds of flights were cancelled because of the snow.

Stranded passengers expressed fury after having to sleep on terminal floors – and contrasted Heathrow’s handling of the severe weather with that of nearby Gatwick, which suffered less disruption despite being hit by more snow.

More than 100 Heathrow flights – 67 of them departures – were grounded yesterday after 440 were cancelled on Friday. Bosses said a fifth of flights would be cancelled today because of forecasts of more wintry weather.

Some frustrated passengers said they had been held on a plane for six hours waiting to take off, before being told their flight had been cancelled and that they had to disembark.

They then had to endure long queues for free hotel vouchers, find their own accommodation or face a night on the floor.

But rival Gatwick, just 24 miles away, kept its runway open and said the 50 cancellations it had made were all due to disruption at other airports.

It said it had boosted its snow-clearing capabilities by studying methods used at Scandinavian airports such as Oslo.

The Met Office said Gatwick had faced about three inches of snow on Friday afternoon, compared with two at Heathrow.

Heathrow is owned by LHR Airports Ltd, known as BAA until October last year. Gatwick is owned and managed by Global Infrastructure Partners.

Critics said Heathrow’s bosses had failed to learn lessons from a period of severe disruption in December 2010, when the airport was paralysed for days by a snowstorm.

Former Transport Minister Lord Adonis said: ‘There are still big concerns about the resilience of Heathrow. Any passengers experiencing delays and cancellations will not be impressed when they see other airports operating more effectively.’

Hannah Furnish, 30, a nurse from Ashtead, Surrey, was dismayed when her flight to Geneva was cancelled yesterday. She said: ‘Other airports across Europe have coped and Gatwick has shown how it should be done. Heathrow has been nothing short of incompetent.’

A total of £36 million has been spent upgrading Heathrow’s winter weather equipment over the past two years, more than doubling the number of snow-clearing vehicles to 130. But it still had to shut its northern runway for more than an hour on Friday morning so snowploughs could clear it of snow and ice.

Soon after the runway was back in operation, the airport’s second runway was also closed for an hour for snow clearance.

Air traffic controllers extended the length of time between flights because of poor visibility and British Airways suffered severe delays in de-icing its aeroplanes’ engines as they sat on the Tarmac awaiting take-off.

Gatwick, which was also forced to ground thousands of planes in 2010, said its management had spent £8 million doubling its ‘snow kit’. The airport was operating as normal yesterday.

LHR Airports admitted that the closure of its runways at Heathrow had caused ‘a lot of disruption’ but said it would be unfair to compare the airport with Gatwick because it had to deal with a greater number of aircraft and was operating at full capacity.

A spokesman added that Heathrow had a much larger area to clear. He said: ‘It is completely different here.’

British Airways passengers at Heathrow complained that although the airline was offering them free hotel vouchers, they had been told hotels were fully booked, so they had to either find their own accommodation and claim back the cost, or sleep on the floor. Sleeping mats, blankets and water were given to people stranded inside Terminal 5.

A spokesman for BA said it had to make about 30 cancellations yesterday, mainly because aircraft and crew were out of position.

But he said passengers on BA flights who no longer wished to travel this weekend could rebook their flight for a later date.
