Chocoholics have been forced to scour the shops for their favourite Green & Black's organic chocolate and almond bar after a nut shortage saw the sweet treat sell out.

Retailers up and down the country have seen demand for the upmarket treat, which costs £2.29 for a 100g bar, by far outstrip supply in recent weeks.

Both Waitrose and Wholefoods have confirmed that they have already sold out.

It has sparked a nationwide scramble in the sweet aisles to snap up what remains of the milk chocolate treat.

The unexpected shortage is believed to have been caused by problem in the supply of almonds, which are imported from harvesters in Europe and America.

California, which grows 80 per cent of the world's almonds, suffered under the effects of a prolonged drought which led to smaller nuts being harvested this year.

Because the product is sold by weight, that meant more nuts were needed to fulfill orders.

To add to poor growing conditions, a dwindling bee population in the west American state has hit harvesters who rely on the pollinators.

Economists have seen a surge in the price of almonds this year, but even that has failed to stem the tide of companies wanting to buy the nut in bulk.

And British shoppers are now seeing the effects on the shelves with bars like Green and Black's almond variety becoming hard to come by.

Dave Price, commercial manager at a 
leading nut supplier, told The Independent: 'Extreme 
temperatures in California meant the state was hit by a drought, leading
to smaller nut sizes. Exporters calculate the product by weight, so 
more nuts are needed. 

'In turn, only larger nuts can be used in processing, all of which has exacerbated price increases'.

'It
looks like Spanish and Italian crops, which have seen demand rise to 
make up the shortfall, will run out before the end of the season, 
despite their raised prices.'

Green & Black said they are working with suppliers to resolve the problem.

A spokesperson said: 'We pride ourselves on delivering the best tasting bars using only the best ingredients.

'Regarding the Green & Black’s Organic Almond Bar we have experienced some challenges in the production of the bar and are working closely with the suppliers of our organic whole roasted almonds to make sure our much loved Almond bar makes it back on shelf as soon as possible.

'We want to take this opportunity to reassure our fans that the product is not being discontinued.'
