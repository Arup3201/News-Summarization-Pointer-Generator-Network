Manchester City will leave the grey skies of home behind after their clash with Arsenal on Sunday.

Manuel Pellegrini's men will head for the sunnier climes of Abu Dhabi for a week of warm weather training in the homeland of their owner.

The Premier League champions will be driven to the airport from the Etihad Stadium after the clash with the Gunners before taking a specially-chartered flight to the Emirates city.

Manuel Pellegrini's side will head to Abu Dhabi for a week of warm weather training after Sunday's match 

While in Abu Dhabi they will take on German side Hamburg on Wednesday in a friendly at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium before heading back to Manchester to take on Championship Middlesbrough in the FA Cup Fourth Round.

The club's women's team, along with its Australian outfit Melbourne City, will also take part in the training camp.

The trip represents a return to the scene of the bizarre Yaya Toure birthday cake row, although the Ivory Coast midfielder, whose agent claimed he was shown a lack of respect by club officials at an end-of-season trip last year, will miss out as he is at the African Cup of Nations.

Meanwhile, City have distanced themselves from claims they are set to swoop for another club.

Yaya Toure is unavailable for the trip as he is on African Cup of Nations duty with the Ivory Coast 

Reports in Malaysia suggested they had been in talks with champions Johor Darul Takzim (JDT) with a view to adding them to an existing stable which includes New York City, Melbourne and a stake of around 20 per cent in Japan's Yokohama F Marinos.

However, it is understood that while a delegation of officials met with JDT's owner, it was merely with a view to providing assistance with scouting and coaching.
