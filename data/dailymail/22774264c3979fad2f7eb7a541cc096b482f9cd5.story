Bones that could belong to King Alfred the Great have been exhumed from a churchyard over fears that they might be stolen or vandalised

It couldbe the year for discovering notorious monarchs.

Just weeks after remains found under a car park were confirmed as Richard III, archaeologists now believe they may just have stumbled on Alfred the Great.

Amid great secrecy, a team exhumed an unmarked grave at a more fitting location for a Royal burial - a churchyard in Winchester named in ancient documents as his burial place.

After a delicate 10-hour operation on Monday, human skeletal remains were unearthed in the churchyard of St Bartholomew’s in the Hyde area of the city, and taken for storage at an undisclosed location.

Unearthing Alfred the Great, the Anglo-Saxon king who fought off the Vikings and established the foundations of our law codes and justice system, would be one of the most significant finds ever.

Historians agree that the king, who died in the year 899 after a distinguished 28-year reign, had a great impact on Britain today, safeguarding the English language and Christian religion.

But archaelogists admit discovering him would be a very long shot, as unlike Richard III who remained under the same car park for five hundred years, Alfred’s bones were moved at least twice.

Earlier this year, Katie Tucker, an archaeologist from the University of Winchester leading the search admitted it would be difficult to prove any remains are his - but hoped her team could prove the age of the bones.

She said: ‘If the bones are from around the 10th century then that is proof they are Alfred and his family, because Hyde Abbey was not built until the 12th Century, and there is no reason for any other bones from the 10th Century to be there.’

No-one from the university would comment on the latest developments last night, as the exhumation was carried out behind metal screens on Monday and yesterday in total secrecy for security reasons - although filmed by a TV company.

It is not known how Alfred the Great died, but he was buried in the Old Minster, the Anglo-Saxon cathedral in Winchester.

Alfred lived from 849 AD to 899 and was born in Wantage, Oxfordshire. He is the only English monarch to be afforded the title The Great

Alfred is the only English monarch to be known as 'the Great' and was the first to consider himself King of the Anglo-Saxons.

Although he is often portrayed as a great warrior in statues around Winchester and Wantage, he was not physically strong and is believed to have suffered poro health for most of his life.

One of the legends surrounding the king was that, while fleeing from Danish aggressors, he hid in the home of a woman who did not recognise him.

She asked him to look over her cakes that were baking in the oven but, troubled by his kingdom's problems, he absent-mindedly allowed them to burn.

Alfred was born in 849 and died on October 26, 899. He had been King of Wessex from 871 until his death. It is not known how he died.

He was originally buried temporarily in the Old Minster in Winchester, then moved to the New Minster. 

In 1110 Alfred's body was transferred to Hyde Abbey. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of Henry VIII, the church was demolished, but the graves were left intact.

The royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed on the site. No confirmed remains of Alfred have subsequently been found.

When Alfred’s son King Edward the Elder built an impressive New Minster two years later - possibly to house his father’s body - the remains were moved there.

Then, in the year 1110, old chronicles reveal the monks at New Minster moved to new location nearby and took the bones with them again, to Hyde Abbey, a little north of the city, along with the remains of King Alfred the Great’s wife and children.

This Abbey was demolished when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries in 1539 although most of the graves were left intact.

The site was looted by convicts in the 1700s and there seem to have been some attempts to dig for Alfred there in the nineteeth century with no success.

Permission to dig at the churchyard was granted by the Diocese of Winchester for security reasons following recent publicity about King Alfred - to prevent people attempting to dig him up.

A spokesperson for the Diocese confirmed human remains were exhumed, and that the rector of St Bartholomew’s and the Bishop of Basingstoke performed prayers at the graveside beforehand.

No application has yet been made to carry out scientific testing on them, but the diocese expect this will be received very soon.

Dr Helen Foxhall Forbes, a lecturer in early medieval history at Exeter University who is not involved in the dig, told the Mail last night: ‘Even if they do radio-carbon dating on the bones which reveals they are from the tenth century, we do not know if it is Alfred.

‘The monks may not have moved the correct bones or made sure they weren’t contamined with any other remains.

‘With Richard III, not only did he have distinguishing features, his scoliosis, to identify him, but they were able to find a surviving descendant after 500 years to do DNA testing. With a king who died more than a thousand years ago that would be very, very difficult.

‘The DNA testing on Richard III was done by experts wearing forensic suits, as even breathing on the remains can contaminate it, so I would be concerned about the amount of tampering with the bones over the centuries.

As a historian I would love it if they found him but it would be an extremely long shot, I would be very dubious if they said they had found Alfred the Great.’
