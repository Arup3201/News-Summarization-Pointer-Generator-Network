The HPV vaccine does not cause riskier sexual behavior in teenage girls or raise rates of STIs, according to U.S. researchers. 

There have been concerns among some parents that the vaccine against human papilloma virus (HPV) causes riskier behavior in teens and raises rates of sexually transmitted infections. 

But the new findings by a team of experts from Harvard Medical School and the University of Southern California were published yesterday in a journal of the American Medical Association.

Health authorities recommend the vaccine for pre-teen and teenage boys and girls as a way to prevent HPV.

If undetected HPV can lead to cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, mouth and throat.

But just 38 percent of girls aged 13-17 in the United States had received all three recommended doses in 2013 and even fewer boys were vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vaccination rates have been slowly rising in the years since 2006 when the vaccine was first introduced. 

In 2013, the most recent year for which officials have data, 57 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys began the HPV vaccine series with at least one of the three recommended shots, the CDC says.

But experts say they would like to see higher rates of vaccination.

Robert Bednarczyk of Emory University wrote in the report: 'Just as we do not wait until we have been in the sun for two hours to apply sunscreen, we should not wait until after an individual is sexually active to attempt to prevent HPV infection.'

In an effort to see if vaccination could be linked to higher STI infection rates, the study compared 21,000 girls who were vaccinated to 186,000 unvaccinated girls of the same age.

Both groups had the same insurance plans and lived in the same area of the United States.

Rates of sexually transmitted infections were measured four times per year, for the year prior to vaccination and the year after.

The girls who were vaccinated had slightly higher rates of STI than the unvaccinated girls, both before and after vaccination.

Researchers said they believe these higher rates were attributable to the higher likelihood of sexual activity among girls who are getting vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated girls.

However, both groups experienced an increase in rates of STIs as they grew older, and this increase occurred at the same pace, whether or not the girls had received the vaccine.

The study said: 'This suggests that the girls' sexual behaviors were not altered in the least by the vaccine.

'Any behaviors resulting in infections that did occur were independent of the vaccine.'

Researchers said if the HPV vaccine had caused an increase in risky sexual behavior they would have found a higher rate of STIs among vaccinated girls after they received the vaccine, since it only protects against HPV and not any other diseases.

 Seth Seabury, study co-author and associate professor of research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Southern California said:'We found no such increase, causing us to conclude that there was no association between using the vaccine and unsafe sexual practices,' 

According to Anupam Jena, assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, the findings should be seen as good news for concerned parents.

He said: 'Since this is one of the few medications ever developed that can actually prevent cancer, it's good to be able to reassure parents, physicians and policymakers that the vaccine does not promote unsafe sexual practices among girls and young women.'

The study was funded by a grant from the US National Institutes of Health.

What is HPV?

The human papilloma virus is the name given to a group of viruses that affect a person's skin as well as the membranes lining the body - for example, in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat.

HPV is very common and highly contagious.

More than three quarters of sexually active women acquiring it at some point in their lives.

And in the U.S. it is the most common sexually-transmitted infection.

The human papilloma virus is a group of more than 100 viruses that affect a person's skin, and membranes lining the cervix, anus, mouth and throat

Most people are oblivious to the fact they have been infected and as a result can pass it on to a partner without realising.

There are more than 100 types of HPV - around 40 of which affect the genital area.

What does HPV infection do?

The majority (nine in 10) of infections disappear of their own accord within two years.

But the other 10 per cent of infections can cause health problems, including:

The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different to those infections that cause cancer.

Other HPV infections can cause more minor problems, including common skin warts and verrucas.

How do people get HPV?

HPV is a sexually-transmitted infections.

In most cases a person will become infected after having vaginal and/or anal sex.

Men and women can also become infected through oral and other sex play.

In many cases a person will not realise they are infected, and can still have HPV years after coming into contact with an infected person.

In very rare cases a pregnant woman can pass HPV to her baby during delivery.

In these cases a child can develop recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a rare condition where warts grow in the throat.

The HPV vaccine

A national vaccination programme for HPV is in place in the US and UK for girls aged 12 and 13.

Three injections are given within a 12-month period by a nurse.

The vaccine is given at a young age because it needs to be administered before a person comes into contact with HPV.

It has also been found to provide greater immune response in preteens, than it does in older teenagers and young women.

Clinical trials have showed the vaccines provide close to 100 per cent protection against precancers and for HPV4 - genital warts.

Since it was first recommended in 2006, there has been a 56 per cent reduction in HPV infections among teenage girls in the US.

Protection offered should be long-lasting, with trials showing the vaccine lasts in the body for at least 10 years.

HPV vaccination does not replace the need for regular cervical smear tests in women between the age of 25 and 65.
