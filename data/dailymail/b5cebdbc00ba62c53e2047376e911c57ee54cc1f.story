Order and progress it says on the Brazilian flag. It’s impossible not to avoid the green, yellow and blue colours which decorate this vast country from the bunting in the streets to the paint on the faces of children.

On Friday night, there was progress into the last four, thanks to an early strike by Thiago Silva and a delicious free-kick by David Luiz, but there was very little order in evidence, at least not on the pitch.

The game was a frantic spectacle where hearts ruled heads, unleashed like a 90-minute sugar-rush. It could have been a runaway home win or quite easily another tear-jerker for the host nation, as Colombia summoned a noble finish.

Ultimately, the progress of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team into the last four of the World Cup will ensure order on the cities of Brazil, and that may be for the best.

The fears and anxieties of 200 million people are soothed for the time being. Colombia have added rhythm and flair to this tournament but could not overcome the collective will inside Fortaleza’s Castelao Stadium, a collective will which at times, it has to be said, seemed to include the officials.

Before the game, Colombian fans suspected they would not be allowed to win; a feeling reinforced when they had a goal by Mario Yepes controversially ruled out for offside when 1-0 down. No-one was off when Yepes shot, but there was a marginal call earlier in the sequence which unfolded from a free-kick.

Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo could not avoid awarding them a penalty, however, when Julio Cesar completely wiped-out substitute Carlos Bacca and James Rodriguez scored, his sixth of the World Cup.

It made for a tense finish. Brazil clung on, although not without collateral damage. Silva is out of the semi-final against Germany after a yellow card and Neymar was carried off late in the game after falling awkwardly.

As it is, Colombia’s 23-year winless run against their neighbours goes on, and so does Brazil’s Samba beat. Scolari’s players collapsed at the final whistle and raised their hands to the sky. They must be on the brink of nervous exhaustion but into the semi-finals they go.

That it should be Silva who struck first was a sweet twist in the narrative of the campaign. He caught Carlos Sanchez napping at the back post to turn in with his left knee a corner won and delivered by Neymar.

Less than seven minutes were gone and Brazil had the nerve-settler of an early lead but, just as they in the previous round against Chile, they were unable to make it count. Nerves would still be in shreds by the final whistle.

Still, after a week of questions, it was impossible not to share Silva’s relief. Off he ran to the opposite corner flag, beating his chest, soon to be mobbed by delirious team-mates as the roof lifted off the Castelao, freed by a rapid response to a week of debate in Brazil, when some claimed he should be stripped of the captaincy.

Emotions had got the better of him in against Chile and his ability to focus was questioned but here his mind was clear. He intercepted a cross and twice hurled his body in the line of shots from Juan Cuadrado.

When Rodriguez slipped Fernandinho and Colombia threatened to swamp Brazil in the first half, who was on the edge of the penalty area, winning back the ball? It was the captain. Silva was superb. As was Fernandinho.

Colombia’s greatest threat came from Rodriguez, drifting into spaces behind Teofilo Gutierrez and Brazil were without Luiz Gustavo, who was banned.

Fernandinho started well, winning the ball and passing it well, both long and short. It was the Manchester City midfielder who unzipped Colombia and released Neymar to win the corner for the first goal.

He didn’t always have Rodriguez under control, although that is no disgrace. Few people in this tournament have contained him. Fernandinho did it well, and he was making crucial tackles deep in stoppage time.

At times, Referee Caballo was too lenient. Rodriguez was targeted, and then booked when he made his first foul, one which led the free-kick scored by Luiz from 30 yards.

Jose Pekerman’s side leave with credit. They refused to roll over after their early setback in a suffocating atmosphere with the game locked in a frantic tempo, pinging back and forth like table-tennis.

A break by Luiz summed everything up. Charging up-field the over-lapping centre-half seemed set on a slalom wonder-goal, only to lose the ball to Christian Zapata and hurtle back in pursuit of the full-back, head back, hair trailing, until he had landed a little physical contact after the ball had moved on. The crowd cheered but and the Colombia bench leapt to their feet in fury but the breathless game had moved on.

Luiz is incredibly popular and will probably be captain on Tuesday in Silva’s absence, but he flexes between pure majesty and total liability. Where he goes, chaos usually follows, but what a free-kick he fired into the top corner to settle the game.
