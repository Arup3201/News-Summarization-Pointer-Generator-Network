Swimming superstar Ellie Simmonds is determined to continue breaking records as the Rio de Janeiro Paralympic Games approach.

Simmonds burst on to the scene at the 2008 Games in Beijing with two gold medals as a 13-year-old.

Now 19 she shows few signs of slowing down ahead of her third Paralympics after impressing in the recent IPC Swimming European Championships in Eindhoven.

Simmonds, who has three world records and features in the Guinness World Records book, said: 'To come away with three golds and two silvers and personal best and also a world record, Europeans went pretty well for me.

'My aim to start off with is just to qualify (for Rio) and to go. I'd love to do personal bests out there, that would be great.'

For Simmonds, who is from Walsall and now trains in Loughborough, personal bests mean world records.

She has three of them - in the 400metres freestyle, the 200m individual medley and in the non-Paralympic discipline, the 800m freestyle - but as a child it was not the swimming records which piqued her interest.

'It's great to be featured in the book,' she added.

'I used to get the book every Christmas. I always looked out for the weird records, like how many piercings, or the tattoos.

'But I don't think I could imagine myself all tattooed up. I don't think it's for me. I don't like needles.'

Simmonds is back in the pool from Monday to prepare for next July's World Championships and Rio.

'We have World Championships next year in Glasgow, home soil, and then Rio after that,' she added.

'It was so exciting watching the Commonwealths. It's a great pool. I look forward to racing in it next year.'
