Sam Allardyce has set his West Ham team a 50-goal target to fire them into the top 10 this season - and is scouring Europe for a striker to help them. 

Allardyce is expected to finish in to the top 10 this season but is confident, with their defensive record last campaign when they kept 14 clean sheet, if they can reach a half-century of goals they will make it.

He has already brought in Enner Valencia for £12million but with Andy Carroll out for up to four months he is on the hunt for another hit-man and is looking abroad for the right player.

Allardyce said: 'If we score a few more goals than last season, we can finish top 10. If we can do the same as we did last season defensively then 50 goals will be enough for us.

'We scored 40 last year and 46 the year before so if we hit the 50-goal mark that will be enough to take us into the top 10 or better.'

Allardyce admitted he has given up looking for a forward in England and is concentrating on the European market for a replacement for Carroll.

He added: 'The price, wages, the type of player – all of those have been stumbling blocks when looking in this country. We are still waiting for another front-line player who could score a few goals.

'That has been very difficult to acquire because of the injury to Andy Carroll but we are still pursuing that avenue as quickly as we possibly can.

'We will definitely get something done but it is the quality of the player that is the most important thing for me. That player has to come here and be available to be used almost immediately.

There may be a settling in period but it is looking more like that player is going to be from abroad rather than from this country. We are still searching high and wide.'
