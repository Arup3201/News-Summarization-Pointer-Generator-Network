Atletico Madrid can repeat last season's success and even improve on it according to their Brazilian defender Miranda.

Last year Atleti won the Spanish title ahead of Barcelona and Real Madrid, as well as reaching the Champions League final, where they lost to their city rivals.

Diego Simeone's side sold several of their stars over the summer, including Diego Costa and Filipe Luis to Chelsea, while Thibaut Courtois' loan came to an end.

Good start: Miranda scored in Atleti's win over Eibar as the Madrid side started with four points in two games

Progress: The Brazilian midfielder insists his club side have improved over the summer despite selling 

But Miranda told Spanish paper AS that his side can continue to challenge on all fronts this season, and could even go a step further than last year's extraordinary successes. 

'I think Atletico can battle to win all of the competitions they are in this season,' Miranda told AS.

'We'll do what we can to bring more silverware to the club. Up until now I've been able to be a part of many of the team's successes and I'm very grateful to the club for that.

Three fronts: Atletico won La Liga last year and Miranda believes they can compete again this time around

'We are going to try to emulate all of the successes from last season.

'I don't think we will struggle after the departures of Thibaut Courtois, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis. The club has brought in some great replacements.'
