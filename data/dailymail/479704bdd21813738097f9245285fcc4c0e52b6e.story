Train drivers are planning a three-day strike during the Olympics in a move bound to cause chaos to those travelling to the Games.

Members of the Aslef union on East Midlands Trains will take industrial action over pensions on August 6, 7 and 8, when a number of athletics finals will be held in the Olympic Stadium.

The news comes as the Public and Commercial Services Union announced thousands of Home Office workers, including Border Agency staff, are to strike on July 26 and take other forms of action until August 20 in a row over jobs, pay and other issues.

David Cameron denounced the proposed strikes during London 2012 as not justifiable or right.

Speaking at a press conference in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, he said: 'I do not believe it will be right, I do not believe it will be justified.'

Aslef union members are proposing strikes on East Midlands Trains for August 6, 7 and 8. Below are just some of the key Olympic events taking place on those days.

Meanwhile, the train company, 
owned by transport giant Stagecoach, said the public will be 'shocked 
and angry' that strikes are being planned at a time of 'great national 
pride' for the country.

The company operates five fast trains to
 and from London every hour with connections between the capital and 
Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby, and Leicester.

David Horne, managing director of 
East Midlands Trains, said: 'This is yet another example of Aslef 
playing games and is a real kick in the teeth for our customers and the 
country.

'The fact is that there was only one 
point of clarification still under discussion with the union on the 
pension proposal we put forward back in June.

'We were in talks with Aslef to deal with this issue when we heard the news that further strike action dates had been announced.

'We're particularly surprised that 
Aslef has announced further strike dates, rather than putting the offer 
that was accepted in principle back in June to their members for 
consideration.

'We hope Aslef can see sense and call off this unnecessary strike action.

'However, if the planned strike action does go ahead, we will be pulling
 out all the stops to ensure that people can still travel by train and 
enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime experience.'

Transport
 Secretary Justine Greening said: 'If there were an Olympic sport of 
self-interest, Aslef union leaders would win it hands down.

'This
 strike threatens Team GB's ability to plan travel from their UK base in
 Loughborough and would disrupt journeys for thousands of commuters and 
spectators.'

Thousands of rail passengers commuting into London faced delays today following signalling problems near London Bridge.

Blown fuses disrupted journeys into the city from the south and some services were cancelled. Services on the Brighton Mainline, Metro, Redhill, Mainline West and Mainline East were affected, Southern Railway said.

A spokesman for Network Rail said the problem began at 5.30am when fuses blew at Honor Oak Park station.

London Bridge is expected to be one of the busiest rail stations during the Olympics. As well as receiving commuters travelling in to work, London Bridge will be the departure point for many thousands attending Games events.

Today's problem also affected services on the London Overground. It was the third day running that commuters had been hit by rush-hour delays.

She added: 'Ed Miliband needs to get a grip on his union paymasters so they call off this damaging and unnecessary strike.'

Train drivers staged six strikes in May
 in protest at changes to their pensions but called off two further 
stoppages in June to allow further talks.

Aslef
 is protesting at plans to reduce pension contributions, a move which 
has been accepted by other unions with members on East Midlands Trains.

General secretary Mick Whelan said: 
'To cut pension contributions in the current climate is highly 
irresponsible. It is widely believed that the fund's assets have 
dramatically decreased since the last valuation.

'Also,
 any suggestion that drivers would save money ignores the fact that the 
pension scheme is split 60/40 between the employer and the employee - so
 if our members are saving £500, the company is saving £750. In total 
that's £1,250 a year less going into the fund per active member.

'This
 is simply storing up trouble for the next valuation and the future of 
the scheme. It is disingenuous to suggest our members are getting 
something for nothing.'

He
 added: 'The current owners of the East Midlands Trains (EMT) franchise 
may have no responsibility over the pension fund in a few years, whereas
 our members face the prospect of either cripplingly high contribution 
rates or reduced benefits due to a short-term cost-cutting decision made
 by EMT that has left the scheme in deficit.'

One week to go: The rail strike is likely to cause chaos for those heading to the Olympic Stadium for the Games, which start next week

Meanwhile, members of the Rail, Maritime and 
Transport (RMT) union on South West Trains have voted to take industrial
 action short of a strike in a row over an Olympic bonus, but rejected 
strikes by a narrow margin of four votes.

Also today, it emerged thousands of 
staff at the Home Office, including airport immigration workers, are to 
stage a 24-hour strike the day before the opening of the Olympics in a 
row over jobs, pay and other issues.

Military personnel working on security for the Olympics will be able to travel free in London during the Games.

London
 Mayor Boris Johnson said all military personnel in uniform would not be
 charged on services operated by Transport for London, including 
the Tube and buses.

This concession will last from Saturday to September 11. Mr
 Johnson said: 'London is ready to welcome the world and host a hugely 
successful Olympic and Paralympic Games.

'That success will be in no 
small measure down to the contribution of our boys and girls in the 
military.

'Now, as ever, they 
have shown themselves ready to go above and beyond the call of duty'

The Public and Commercial Services 
union (PCS) said its members will walk out on July 26, and will take 
other forms of industrial action, such as a ban on overtime, from July 
27 to August 20.

The action will hit border controls 
at ports and airports including Heathrow, threatening disruption to 
people travelling to London for the Games.

The union warned it will announce 
further action if ministers continue to 'refuse' to negotiate an 
agreement, warning that job and spending cuts are hitting services to 
the public.

The strike will involve staff across 
the Home Office, including the UK Border Agency, the Identity and 
Passport Service and Criminal Records Bureau.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka 
said: 'The lives of staff have been made intolerable by these cuts and 
they're at breaking point.

'Ministers have known about these issues for a very long time and need to act now to sort out the chaos they have caused.

'They're acting recklessly in cutting
 so many jobs and privatising services, and are provocatively refusing 
to talk to us with a genuine desire to reach an agreement.'

Home Secretary Theresa May branded the PCS strike decision 'shameful'.

'I think that is shameful, frankly,' she said in a round of broadcast interviews.

'They are holding a strike on what is one of the key days for people coming in for the Olympic Games.

'We will of course put contingency 
arrangements in place to ensure we can deal with people coming through 
the border as smoothly as possible.'

Answering questions after 
delivering a speech in central London, Ed Miliband said: 
'People should not be striking during the Olympics. People should not be
 disrupting the Olympic Games.'

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed
 unions would be 'completely out of tune' with the public mood if they 
held a strike during the Games.
