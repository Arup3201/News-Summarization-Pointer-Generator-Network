Western Australia is now considered the world's deadliest place for shark attacks and since 2012 six people have been killed - with the number of attacks said to be rising.

In a bid to solve this problem, scientists from the area have fitted 320 sharks with special transmitters that track the animals’ movements.

If a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of any beach along the west coast, a receiver will trigger an alert, which then generates an automatic warning tweet.

Due to a rise in shark attacks off the coast of Western Australia, scientists have fitted 320 sharks in the area, including tiger sharks, pictured, with transmitters. If a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of a beach an alert is triggered. This then generates an automatic warning tweet

Australian scientists fitted 320 sharks, including tiger sharks, great whites and bronze whaler sharks, with transmitters that track the animals' movements.

If
 a tagged shark swims within a kilometre of any beach along the west 
coast, a receiver in the water triggers an alert.

This, in turn, generates an automatic warning tweet containing the breed of the shark as well as the time it triggered the alarm and the shark’s approximate location.

This location is based on which receiver was triggered.

The transmitters were fitted by the Surf Life Saving Western Australia's (SLSWA) group and the tweet is sent from the company’s Twitter feed.

Each tweet details the breed of the shark as well as the time it triggered the alarm and the shark’s approximate location.

Among the sharks tagged are tiger sharks, great whites and bronze whaler sharks.

The tweets are used in conjunction with the lifeguard patrols and helicopter sightings.

The Twitter feed also keeps followers up to date with rescue missions and informs of beach closures, including those that have been closed due to shark sightings.

As well as warning nearby swimmers to avoid potentially shark-infested waters, the tags are additionally being used by researchers to learn more about the sharks’ movements and behaviour.

Dr Rory McAuley, from the Department of Fisheries told Sky News: ‘The battery life of internal acoustic tags is up to 10 years so the scientific data that may be collected from this shark is unprecedented.’

Ministers have also signed an agreement allowing fishermen in the region to use bait to attract and catch sharks during the summer months.

Any sharks larger than three metres will then be killed to protect swimmers. 

Despite this rise, deaths from shark attacks are rare. According to figures from National Geographic, people have a one in 3.7 million chance of being killed by a shark.
