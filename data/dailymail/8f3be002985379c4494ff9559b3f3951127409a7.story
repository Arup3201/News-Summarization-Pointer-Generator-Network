Teenage girls see sexualisation as ‘part and parcel’ of their lives because of the raunchy behaviour of pop stars such as Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, an academic claimed yesterday.

Their skimpy outfits and sexual dance moves are ruining the self-esteem of girls, according to Professor Dionne Taylor, an expert in criminal law.

She found the explicit dance moves and foul-mouthed lyrics fuel negative attitudes towards women and affect women’s confidence, education and even their employment prospects.

Miley Cyrus sparked criticism after her provocative gyrations with Robin Thicke at the MTV music awards

Professor Taylor’s comments come as Miss Cyrus, 20, promotes her new single Wrecking Ball.

The song’s racy video, which features the pop star swinging naked on a demolition ball, was unveiled online just days ago and received more than 19million views within 24 hours.

Its release follows Miss Cyrus’s controversial performance at the MTV Music Video Awards last month. The singer paraded on stage in a bra and knickers and gyrated wildly during a duet with Robin Thicke, prompting criticism from parents.

Professor Taylor accused stars such as Miss Cyrus of giving ‘mixed messages’ to impressionable young women.

The majority of women 15-29 said hyper sexualisation impacted on their confidence and self-esteem

‘She has appropriated the video vixen persona,’ she added.

‘There was a part where she had backing dancers and she smacked their bottoms. It was ignorant. The men we see in these videos are fully clothed and women are scantily clad.’

Rihanna has repeatedly come under fire for her skimpy clothing and lewd song lyrics.

Professor Taylor, a criminal lecturer and researcher, studied black women aged 15 to 29 from Birmingham and London.

She said they saw sexualisation as ‘part and parcel of life’ and added that she had experienced the problem first-hand.

Rihanna has repeatedly come under fire for her skimpy clothing and lewd song lyrics, and outrageous behaviour

‘As a teenager I was told, “you’ve got a big bum” – the focus was always on my body parts.

‘There was a feeling that you had to conform in some ways to these images to be worthwhile.

‘I have a younger sister and she used to say she didn’t feel confident in herself and that was mainly derived from popular black music genres.

‘The majority of my participants said the hyper-sexualisation of music videos and magazines impacted on their confidence, education and employment. It damaged their self-esteem.’

An independent review into the sexualisation of childhood, carried out by Mothers’ Union chief executive Reg Bailey in 2011, recommended that the Government introduce age ratings on music videos.

Last year music mogul Mike Stock, who wrote Kylie Minogue’s hit single I Should Be So Lucky, also complained about the ‘sluttish’ lyrics of pop music, in particular those of Lady Gaga.

Mr Stock said: ‘It’s easy – if you haven’t got much of a sell, stick some sex in the video and it’s job done. It’s both easy and lazy.

‘It’s largely the Americans, to be honest – the new breed of rap and Lady Gaga types. They’re all just sluttish.

‘And young girls think they are someone worth emulating.’

Walkwood Church of England Middle School in Redditch becomes the first to ban skirts for girls aged nine. The ban comes as increasing numbers of young girls copy the 'sexy schoolgirl' look popularised by celebrities such as Rihanna and Katy Perry. David Doubtfire, headmaster of the Worcestershire school, said the ban would eliminate 'unladylike' short skirts.

Liz Jones writes that Rihanna is a toxic role model.

Liz says the message Rihanna sends to young fans, through lyrics, dance moves and Twitter, is toxic

'Young women are far more impressionable than young men. They want to be Rihanna, have her lifestyle, her clothes, her men, her habits. I
wish she’d stop infecting our High Streets with her gun tattoos, her 
false nails and fake hair, her bogus bad-ass shenanigans that try to 
portray her as ‘real’, as ‘street’, as her own person, as strong and 
single-minded.

'While Rihanna knows when to tone it down in order to pull in advertising deals and keep her record label sweet - so much so that she has enough dollar bills to use them as a carpet, and so many diamonds she can pretend to smoke them in a spliff, both things she's been pictured doing - the message she's sending to her young fans, through her explicit lyrics, vile dance moves and pictures on Twitter, is utterly toxic. This poisonous pop princess should come with a government health warning.'

August 2013

Shona Sibary is astounded at her daughter's blase reaction to Miley's VMAs twerking performance.

Shona's daughter Flo thought that Miley and Robin's performance was 'quite a cool act'

'What stunned me even more than Miley's excruciating display of pornographic innuendo was my daughter's reaction. For rather than sharing my dismay at the route her once favourite TV star has taken, Flo's response to the debacle was that it was 'quite a cool act'.

'It is this insouciance, this almost jaded retort from my teenage daughter at what was blatantly a dance routine choreographed to cause offence that, as a mother, I find so disturbing. Yes, of course, Miley Cyrus is 20 and no longer a teenager. And it's nothing if not predictable that she is hell-bent on letting the world know it. But what of her fans - those girls who, just like Flo, loved Miley as children and are on the brink of womanhood themselves? I can't help but feel they are on the receiving end of a seemingly endless barrage of sexual imagery.'

The Parents Television Council issued a statement in which executes called Miley Cyrus' performance 'twerking' on stage in a flash-colored latex bikini 'sexually exploitative' and said it 'simply substituted talent with sex.'

The Family Television Council, a non-profit group, blasted MTV for allowing the show to air and demanded 'heads should roll' at the cable network.

A member of the Council's advisory board, former BET network executive Paul Porter, said: 'The Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke performance simply substituted talent with sex... While the performance was shocking to the audience, MTV approved it during the show run prior to the broadcast.

Dan Isett, public policy director for the Parents Television Council called on Congress to change cable TV rules as he criticized MTV. He singled out Miley's on-stage performance.

'MTV continues to sexually exploit young women by promoting acts that incorporate 'twerking' in a nude-colored bikini. How is this image of former child star Miley Cyrus appropriate for 14-year-olds?' he demanded.
