Stephen Dockerill, 48, ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating in his thirties

A father who lost 13 stone after gastric bypass surgery has spoken of his misery of being left with two stone of excess skin hanging from his stomach.

Stephen Dockerill, 48, ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating in his thirties.

His weight has since plummeted to 18 stone after gastric bypass surgery - but he is unable to move properly, sleep on his back or swim due the huge apron of excess skin that comes to his knees.

Mr Dockerill, who also has excess skin 
on his arms and thighs, told ITV's This Morning: 'I feel like I've traded one problem for 
another - it's like being a prisoner in my own body.'

He is now desperate for an NHS operation to get the excess skin removed, which he describes as 'like a hanging skirt'.

Despite being active in his twenties, playing rugby and swimming, the weight piled on his thirties.

'It was a
psychological thing - I had a few bad relationships and turned to booze 
and comfort eating,' he said. 'Over the years I got bigger and bigger and my weight
got out of control.'

After years of depression and snacking 
on fish and chips, kebabs and fried breakfasts, his weight hit 31st 9lb.

He said: 'Even then, my skin was hanging from my belly like a skirt because I was so big. It was very uncomfortable.

'My belly was on my knees - I couldn't get a pair of trousers on, only XXXXXXL jogging bottoms, and even then I had to wear braces to keep them up.'

Mr Dockerill (pictured here with sister Karen) lost 13 stone after gastic bypass surgery. He told ITV1's This Morning he had been left with 2 stone of excess skin around his stomach

The crunch point came when his doctor told him if he didn't lose weight, he would be dead by the age of 55. 

Too fat for a gastric band, he first underwent  a gastric balloon procedure in February last year to make his stomach feel full.

Uncomfortable: The 2 stone of excess skin means Mr Dockerill struggles with the most basic of tasks, such as walking and sleeping

Then in October, he underwent gastric bypass surgery. This is where part of the digestive system is removed so the patient can only absorb around 50 per cent of the calories he consumed.

Despite losing a staggering 13 stone in total, his success has turned to agony. Although he has lost the fat, his skin still sags to his knees. 

People who lose weight quickly, such as those who've had weight loss surgery, are particularly prone to excess skin.

Mr Dockerill also struggles with the most basic of tasks, such as walking and sleeping.

He addded: 'I can’t sleep on my back 
because of the pressure on my belly, so I have to lie on my side. If I 
want to turn, I have to lift the skin. It’s exhausting.'

The excess skin also means he can't go swimming, as the excess skin hangs from the bottom of his trunks. He must also tuck it down one leg of his jogging bottoms in order to get dressed.

He also suffers from sores and fungal infections and is the butt of cruel jibes in the street.

'It would be nice to have a relationship - I have been on my own for 11 years.'

This Morning's resident doctor Carol Cooper, said: 'Skin is elastic, but it will stretch so much.

'This means people who have lost huge amounts of weight can be left with massive folds of loose skin - and we are seeing more and more of these cases.

'Cosmetic surgery will remove the skin folds that Stephen needs, but it will be quite intensive surgery. It also costs at least £6,000 to have it done privately.

'There are no national guidelines as to who can get a tummy tuck on the NHS. Doctors have to make a strong medical case to get the op on the NHS, such as the patient suffering recurrent skin infections and severe restrictions in daily living.'

Excess skin is extremely common after weight loss surgery, explains Guido Kohler, a plastic surgeon who works privately and at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

‘This excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body,’ he says.

Factors that affect how much skin is left after a dramatic weight loss include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had.

‘After extreme weight loss, many patients develop an “apron” of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs,’ explains Mr Kohler. ‘It can all be very uncomfortable and upsetting.’

This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems, too.

One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry.

Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric (weight loss) surgery.

Mr Kohler says: ‘Sadly, there are some patients who do not seem to have been prepared for this situation beforehand, and post-weight loss can be a very disappointing and psychologically damaging time for them. Some do question why they had the surgery in the first place.’
