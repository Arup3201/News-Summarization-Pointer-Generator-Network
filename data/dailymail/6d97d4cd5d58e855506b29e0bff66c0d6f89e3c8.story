Luis Suarez may have returned to training amid much fanfare, but for Real Madrid it was business as usual, as their galaxy of stars were put through their paces in a training session on Friday. 

Fresh from winning the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday, Real's players looked relaxed as they continued their preparations for the start of the new season.

Los Blancos defeated Sevilla 2-0 to claim their first piece of silverware of the campaign, and take on rivals Atletico Madrid on Tuesday in the first leg of the Copa Del Rey after a friendly against Fiorentina on Saturday.

Cristiano Ronaldo was at his blistering best on Tuesday against Sevilla, as he scored a brace, and seemed to have shaken off the injuries that hampered him at the World Cup.

His understanding with Gareth Bale also looks to be improving with every match, and it was the Welshman who set up Ronaldo's first goal against Sevilla with a sumptuous cross. 

Angel di Maria also took part in Friday's training session, amid rumours that he may be leaving the Bernabeu before the end of the month.
