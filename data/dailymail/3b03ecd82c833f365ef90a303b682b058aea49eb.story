To the digital generation these images might look like a batch of iPhone snaps edited on Instagram.

But photographer Jon Nicholson went back to basics and used an original Polaroid camera and film three years out of date to create a portfolio of hued seaside images.

After feeling 'hacked off with the likes of Instagram' he wanted to create the 1970s-style effects the old fashioned way and spent 18 months capturing the coastal scenes.

The 70 photographs have been compiled into a book, entitled Seaside Polaroids which is released on March 21.

The 51-year-old, who was official behind the scenes photographer for London 2012 Olympics described his tour of British beaches as a 'slow, personal project' to explore places he would not usually encounter at work.

'These
photographs are the original form of Instagram, These sort of pictures are what Instagram is trying to be, and they show what went before 
shooting on your iPhone.

At first glance it might seem the images were edited on Instagram but a Polaroid camera was used to achieve the retro effect

'My
wife bought me the old camera from eBay as a present. I managed to get 
hold of the last hundred barrels of film for the camera in the country. I only had so much film, which is a shame.

Mr Nicholson said he enjoyed the project and was satisfied with the end result,' he said.

'The pictures of Blackpool and Great Yarmouth are great, the colours are unbelieveable.

To create the images authentically Jon Nicholson had to track down barrels of film three years out of date

The project took 18 months and 100 rolls of film to create the book of 70 images taken on a Polaroid SX70

'Photography
is changing so much, we've all got these digital tools now. You can 
print off Instagram pictures but I've been a photographer for 30 years 
and wanted to go back to the original.'

He added: 'If you go out with a digital camera, people fear you, whereas with this 1970s camera everyone smiles at you.'

'Part of the reason I did the project
was because I was a bit hacked off with the likes of Instagram, whereas
actually here is the real deal.

'People can recreate this themselves 
with an old camera and old film from the Impossible Projects website. 
You have to have a creative eye and just go out an do it.'
