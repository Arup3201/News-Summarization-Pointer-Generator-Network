Frank Lampard will finally get to meet his new New York City team-mates when they head to Manchester to play two friendlies next month.

The Manchester City midfielder was expected to join the club’s new Major League Soccer franchise in January at the expiration of his ‘loan’ to Manuel Pellegrini’s side.

However, after the Premier League club announced Lampard would stay until the end of the English season it emerged that the player had only signed a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC and had actually penned a 12-month agreement at City.

That deal had a break clause in December which was meant to allow the former Chelsea man to go to the US.

But after playing a key role in Manchester, and under pressure from Pellegrini, Lampard stayed put.

City have now announced that, ahead of their season which kicks off in March, NYCFC will play two friendlies at the stadium in their new, 7,000-seat £200m City Football Academy.

Coach Jason Kreis’ men will take on St Mirren on February 10 and Danish outfit Brondby five days later.

‘St Mirren and Brondby will provide top class opposition for us ahead of our first competitive MLS game against Orlando on March 8,’ Kreis told the City website.

‘We’re delighted to be taking on such strong opposition at a very important stage of our pre-season.’

Lampard, 36, is now expected to join NYCFC in July.
