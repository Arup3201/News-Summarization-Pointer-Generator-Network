Former World Cup winning goalkeeper Gilmar Rinaldi has been appointed Brazil's new technical director - and the 55-year-old instantly ruled out the possibility of a foreign coach taking over the Selecao.

Rinaldi's appointment comes three days after coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and his backroom staff resigned following Brazil's humiliating 7-1 loss to Germany in their World Cup semi final.

Scolari's successor is expected to be 
announced on Tuesday but Rinaldi said there was no chance of Brazil hiring
 a foreign coach for the first time in their history, as some have 
wanted.

'I think this is the time to look inside our own house, for someone who 
knows our problems and qualities - and there are many,' he said.

'We
 want someone who knows us and we don't have a lot of time, we want to 
choose someone quickly. We have a lot of good and well trained coaches. I
 don't think (a foreign coach) would adapt to what we want right now.'

Rinaldi, 55, was reserve keeper in 1994 when Brazil won their fifth 
World Cup title - and Brazilian Football Confederation president Jose Maria Marin talked up his appointment on Thursday.

'He is general coordinator and he will coordinate all Brazil's national 
teams, including the women's team,' Marin said.
 'He is the link between the president and the coaches.'

From the south of the country, Rinaldi kept goal for 
Internacional, Sao Paulo, Flamengo and Cerezo Osaka in Japan, before 
returning to his homeland to serve as technical director at Flamengo.

When he left the Rio club, he served as a player's agent, but told reporters he had on Wednesday informed his final clients he can no longer represent them.
