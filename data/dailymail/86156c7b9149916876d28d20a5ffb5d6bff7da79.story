New pictures of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz as a smiling schoolboy have emerged - on the day Lufthansa Airlines admitted they knew six years ago that he suffered from a 'serious depressive episode'.

The airline said that as part of its internal research it found emails Lubitz sent to the Lufthansa flight school in Bremen when he resumed his training there after an interruption of several months.

In them he informed the school that he had suffered a 'serious depressive episode' which had since subsided.

The airline said Lubitz subsequently passed all medical checks and that it has provided the documents to prosecutors. 

It declined to make any further comment today.

Questions have been raised about what the airline knew about Lubitz's condition before last week's fatal crash.

Authorities say the 27-year-old, who in the past had been treated for suicidal tendencies, locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing the Airbus 320 into a mountain in the French Alps.

All 150 people aboard Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf were killed that day.

Earlier today Lufthansa said it had set aside £203million to deal with possible costs from the March 24 crash.

Meanwhile pictures of Lubitz at various ages while a pupil at Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany, were released today - the same day it emerged Lubitz's girlfriend knew he had psychological issues..

Kathrin Goldbach reportedly told investigators she 'did not know the extent of the problems' despite her boyfriend seeing doctors a number of times in the months leading up to the disaster.

Prosecutors said he had been treated for suicidal tendencies as a younger man and had been seen by doctors for depression on at least three occasions since February.

He had also been to see an eye specialist over fears he was going blind, a condition that could have seen him stripped of his licence.

The girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) knew he had psychological issues but the couple 'were optimistic' they could work through them, according to a source close to the investigation 

Investigators are now increasingly certain this was the prime motive for his act of suicide and mass murder.

But Miss Goldbach is said to be as shocked as anyone that his mental health problems would lead to him deliberately crashing his jet, killing all 150 people on board.

A European government official close to the probe told CNN that Miss Goldbach knew he had seen two doctors - an eye consultant and a neuropsychologist - who both deemed him unfit for work.

The eye doctor had diagnosed his failing eyesight as merely psychosomatic, the source added, confirming previous reports that the condition was not physical at all.  

He was given sick notes - found torn up at his home in Dusseldorf - and ordered by doctors to take time off work. 

But he feared this would increase his chances of being grounded, so he hid his sickness from his employers.

Calling for change: Anneli Tiirik with her boyfriend Paul Bramley, who died in the Alps plane disaster

The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots.

At present, airlines carry out regular checks on their pilots, but this often just involves a brief chat with a doctor to assess their wellbeing.

Anneli Tiirik, who is from Estonia, told MailOnline: 'Besides general physical, psychological and behavioural evaluation, another test should be added, I believe, to help avoid more deaths in the future.

'(This should be) a neurological PET scan to discover and attentively observe psychopathic tendencies, so as to find out whether the subject is prone to violence and therefore not be given the extensive power that would most likely lead to harming other people.

'It is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive, but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand.'

Ms Tiirik also called for laws to be relaxed to allow doctors greater freedoms to flag up patients with mental health problems if they are responsible for the live of others.

German law meant it was left entirely up to Andreas Lubitz to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash.

She said: 'I personally think that the problem doesn't lie in the management of the airline as much as in the general tendency of the society to be overly protective about people's medical data.

'It is visible to everyone if somebody has a serious physical illness, but when it comes to major mental problems, these are hidden away at any cost for fear of embarrassment or judgement.

'However, those are illnesses as well and should be treated and inspected accordingly, especially when it comes to job positions regarding huge responsibilities.'

Her boyfriend, Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with her.

He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days' holiday with friends.

Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.

In a separate development, officials say it looks more and more likely that his primary motive for crashing the jet was due to his false fears about his failing eyesight.

Bild newspaper, quoting a source close to the investigation, reported the official as saying: 'A main motive seems to be the fear that Lubitz had of losing his ability to fly because of medical problems.'

Prosecutors hinted at this on Monday, but said trawls of his paperwork and computer files could not pin down a precise cause.  

However, there is speculation in Germany that the Germanwings marque may not survive the tsunami of lawsuits which are expected to be unleashed upon it.  

Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis.

The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster.

But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash.

The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law.

Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany.

This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death.

Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent.

With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life.

They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder.

Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy.

Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege.
