The police union paid a PR firm for advice on using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against ministers just weeks before the Plebgate scandal.

The media strategy also called for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt government plans to reform pay and conditions for officers.

The secret plot was laid down in a £10,000-a-month contract handed to the public relations company by the Police Federation.

The revelation will worsen relations between the union’s officials and the Conservative Party, which believes Andrew Mitchell was ‘stitched up’ in the September 2012 Plebgate affair.

The revelation about the Police Federation's PR 'guerrilla' campaign will worsen relations between the union's officials and the Conservative Party, which believes Andrew Mitchell was 'stitched up' in the September 2012 Plebgate affair. The media campaign was a response to Home Secretary Theresa May’s hardline approach

The former chief whip has always denied calling Downing Street police officers ‘****ing plebs’, insisting the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends.

Representing 125,000 rank and file officers, the union was furious at Home Secretary Theresa May’s hardline approach to the reforms.

And, just months before Plebgate, Federation bosses signed up for the services of Jon Gaunt, who is a former newspaper columnist and radio DJ, and his brother Jason.

The contract stated Mr Gaunt’s firm would be paid £10,000 a month to undertake a campaign using ‘guerrilla tactics’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ against government police pay reform.

The deal lasted only two months but Mr Gaunt continued to provide PR advice to three branches of the federation in the Midlands, all central to the ‘Plebgate’ storm.

Three delegates from West Midlands, West Mercia and Warwickshire met Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office near Birmingham. Afterwards they claimed he refused to provide an account of the incident – their tough stance adding to pressure that later saw him quit the Government.

Mr Gaunt went to the meeting with the three officers, who were later heavily criticised by the Commons home affairs committee.

Their federations had previously mocked the Government and the chief whip by printing 'PC Pleb' T-shirts.

MPs have claimed Mr Gaunt leaked details of the private meeting to the media.

And a secret recording made by Mr Mitchell showed he had apologised for swearing at the Downing Street officers and denied using the word ‘plebs’.

Last year, national Federation officials discussed whether a copy of the ‘guerrilla tactics’ contract should be sent to the home affairs committee, which was investigating Plebgate. A row erupted when the decision was made not to do so.

Today, a whistleblower, who claims she was unfairly dismissed after raising concerns about the Federation, is expected to be questioned about the agreement by the Commons committee.

Fiona McElroy has spoken of a ‘vocal minority’ who resisted her efforts which were, she claims, ‘undertaken in good faith and with encouragement, mostly in the absence of any strategy, guidelines, policy or support’.

Miss McElroy’s testimony comes after a key witness to Plebgate claimed the Federation exploited the affair.

In February, Ian Richardson, one of the four police officers on duty at the time, said he believed Mr Mitchell called the officers ‘****ing plebs’ as claimed in the original police log. But the former officer added that although Mr Mitchell’s behaviour was officious and rude, he did not deserve to lose his job in government over a ‘quirky incident’.

He condemned the Federation for stirring up the case against the politician, who he felt was treated ‘like tethered prey’ in the days before he was forced to resign.

He also said the officers at the gate were undermined by colleagues in the Met’s diplomatic protection group who leaked the log of the incident and by the actions of PC Keith Wallis, who has been jailed for 12 months for lying about witnessing the incident.

Last night the Federation refused to answer questions about its media contract with Gaunt Brothers.

A spokesman told the Mail: ‘In 2012, the Police Federation of England and Wales contracted Gaunt Brothers to assist with a communications campaign around the likely effect on public safety of government budget cuts to policing.

‘The contract was terminated after two months and the company has not been used by the national Police Federation since.

‘The Home Affairs Committee are aware that the Police Federation used Gaunt Brothers. Owing to commercial sensitivity, it would be inappropriate to discuss the details of the contract.’

Former Sun columnist Mr Gaunt, 53, the son of a police officer who has been hailed as ‘the monster who roars for coppers’ on the website of the Metropolitan Police Federation, also refused to discuss the contract.

He said: ‘I had a contract with them but obviously it’s confidential. There was a confidentiality clause.’
