London Mayor Boris Johnson has condemned a European Court of Justice ruling against a British application to block the so-called 'Robin Hood Tax'

European judges have rejected a bid by Britain to block a financial transaction tax on the City which could cost Britain £25billion-a-year.

Boris Johnson condemned the 'barmy' plan, which he warned would lead the UK at the mercy of interference from Brussels.

The European Court of Justice ruled against a British application to block the tax, claiming it was premature when the detail of the plan has not been agreed at EU level.

The British government has not signed up to the controversial tax, which it is feared, could lead to levies on transactions capable of severely affecting deals made in the City of London.

A study from the Right-wing think tank the Adam Smith Institute last year estimated the total cost to the UK economy alone could be as high as £25.5billion a year.

Mr Johnson condemned the ruling to throw of the UK legal challenge, claiming rival 
financial centres would now be 'licking their lips' at the prospect of 
picking up trade from Britain.

The London Mayor said: 'This judgment beggars belief. With London’s economy 
buoyant once more and driving the national recovery, the last thing that
 we need is a barmy tax that will stamp on growth and potentially drive 
businesses to financial centres outside the EU.

'Finance is a global 
game and our rivals in the US and Asia will be licking their lips in 
sheer delight.

'This ruling also raises serious questions about how the 
UK can safeguard its financial services sector, given that we are not in
 the euro.

'The Government has been right to oppose this all along 
and I am sure they will continue to fight this nonsense still further.

'We cannot allow jobs, growth and livelihoods to be jeopardised by those 
in the EU who mistakenly view financial services as an easy target, 
despite the fact that the industry is crucial to the economic recovery 
of all its members.'

Concerns have been raised that British financial
 institutions engaging in transactions with those in the participating 
EU member states would be liable to pay the FTT, which would then have 
to be collected by the UK tax authorities.

The Government challenged a
 decision allowing 'enhanced co-operation' between the 11 countries, 
including France and Germany, in favour of setting up the FTT.

The European Court of Justice ruling has sparked fears trade could be lost to other financial centres around the world

But 
the ECJ ruled that 'the contested decision does no more than authorise 
the establishment of enhanced co-operation, but does not contain any 
substantive element on the FTT itself' and 'the elements of a future FTT
 challenged by the United Kingdom are in no way constituent elements of 
the contested decision'.

The Treasury said the ECJ decision allowed 
the Government to mount a fresh challenge when the final proposals for 
an FTT are produced.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage branded the Financial Transaction Tax a 'deliberate assault on the City of London'

A spokesman said: 'The Government is determined to continue
 to ensure that the interests of countries outside of the single 
currency but inside the single market are properly protected as the euro
 area continues to integrate, including with any proposal for a 
Financial Transactions Tax.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed the FTT 
was a 'deliberate assault on the City of London' adding: 'This FTT judgment shows that the UK cannot act to 
protect the UK’s biggest interest. It is impotent and at the mercy of an
 antagonistic federalist court - the ECJ.

'It shows Cameron’s 
argument that the UK Government can negotiate a better deal for British 
business from within the EU as a fraud and a farce.

'The only way to 
protect the UK financial interest is to withdraw from the tax-hungry EU 
and stop giving Brussels power over us.'

The Institute of Directors' senior adviser on Europe, Allie Renison, said: 'Two of the last four legal challenges brought by the UK against EU rules on financial services have now been thrown out.

'While there is still some hope for a future challenge when the FTT is put into place, there is a real risk that the financial industry's support for EU membership may be eroded as a result.'

But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady 
said: 'The Chancellor should never have taken this case and used 
taxpayers’ money to defend City fat cats.

'It’s time the financial sector
 paid its fair share of the costs of the economic crisis they helped 
cause.'
