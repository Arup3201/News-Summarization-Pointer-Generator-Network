It is the most glittering and controversial fixture in the Conservative social calendar – the Black and White fundraising ball, which raises millions of pounds for party coffers.

But organisers of the £15,000-a-table event have been so stung by adverse publicity about previous guests that they have banned table plans and place settings in an attempt to keep identities secret.

Among the 1,100 guests expected at a five-star London hotel tomorrow are Sir Michael Hintze, the billionaire hedge fund manager who gave the Tories £1.5 million last year, and property developer David Rowland, a former tax exile, who has given more than £1.8 million to the Conservatives over four years.

The ball's organisers were furious after last year's table plan fell into the hands of journalists – who calculated that the total worth of the guests came to more than £22 billion.

They included Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born energy magnate who sat on a table with the then Energy Minister Michael Fallon, along with two MPs, James Wharton and Alun Cairns, to whom he has donated money. 

In 2013, Mr Temerko paid £90,000 for a bust of David Cameron at a separate Conservative fundraiser just months after his renewable energy company received £4.5 million from the taxpayer.

The leaked table plan also revealed that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is in charge of welfare reforms, was seated with directors of doorstep lending firm CLC Finance, which has advertised loans with annual rates of interest of up to 769.9 per cent.

The Prime Minister, who usually attends the ball with his wife Samantha, will give the keynote speech.
