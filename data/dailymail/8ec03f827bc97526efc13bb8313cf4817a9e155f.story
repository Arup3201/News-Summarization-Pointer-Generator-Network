Trips of a lifetime for thousands of holidaymakers have been wrecked after the collapse of an international budget airline.

At least 4,000 passengers are stranded and sleeping on airport floors because Air Australia has run out of money and went into voluntary administration today, immediately grounding its five-jet fleet.

Some of those affected are stuck as far away as Honolulu, Hawaii, and Phuket in Thailand.

The Brisbane-based international and domestic airline, formerly known as Strategic Airlines, said all flights had been cancelled and the airline would not be accepting new bookings because it could no longer pay its bills.

Air Australia's fleet consists of five Airbus A330-200 and A320-200 aircraft, and regularly flies to Bali, Phuket, Honolulu and cities within Australia.

'It currently appears that there are no funds available to meet operational expenses so flights will be suspended immediately,' the airline said in a statement.

Passengers who bought tickets with credit cards or had travel insurance may be given a refund, the airline said.

Family: A mother and her children stranded in Phuket today

Around 4,000 passengers were overseas with Air Australia round-trip tickets, voluntary administrator Mark Korda said. 

'Overnight, the company was unable to refuel its planes in Phuket,' Korda told Australia's Fairfax Radio.

'The directors appointed us at 1:30 this morning and the boys have been working throughout the night to deal with what's a very difficult situation.'

Stranded in Honolulu, Priya Sinh was forced to postpone her 18th birthday party on Saturday at her home on Australia's Gold Coast.

She used her iPad to log onto Facebook to tell her 70 guests not to come because she would not be back in time.

'We tried to laugh about it, but it wasn't funny,' she said while her family called hotels looking for a room.

Her mother managed to reserve the last four seats on a Jetstar flight to Sydney leaving on Saturday.

Australian airline Qantas and Jetstar, its budget subsidiary, were considering adding services to help stranded passengers get to their destinations or home.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the airline will sell stranded passengers tickets for the same price they paid for their Air Australia tickets, giving them a chance to recover the full price from their travel agencies or credit card companies.

Air Australia's administrators are calling for immediate expressions of interest in the sale of the business.
