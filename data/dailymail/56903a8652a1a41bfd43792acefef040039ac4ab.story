A man has died after the helicopter he was flying in crashed into a field.

The two-man single-engined Robinson R22 pitched into a field behind Lancaster Way Business Park, Ely, Cambridgeshire just before lunchtime.

Emergency teams were called at 11.27am to reports that an aircraft carrying one person had crash landed.

Crash site: A man died when his helicopter crashed near Cambridge just before lunchtime

It is believed that the helicopter left Kent and headed for Spalding in Lincolnshire. The company provides 
pilot training for private and commercial licences.

A man was walking his dog when the helicopter crashed just 15 yards from where he stood.

Pat Masterson, in his 40s, was today recovering from shock after attempting to pull the pilot from the wreckage.

Clare Blair, 54, a mum-of-three and a member of Orchard Park Community Council from Cambridge said the man - her daughter's partner - was walking his four-month-old border collie when the aircraft crashed.

She said: 'My daughter's partner was walking his puppy when the helicopter crashed just 15 yards from where they stood.

'There was one man in the helicopter and he tried to help him. He then ran to a cottage nearby and rang the emergency services.

'A farmer also came to help and the elderly woman who lives in the cottage. It was a very serious crash and traumatic for everyone involved.

'My daughter's partner is in shock and has gone to bed. I went to collect the puppy because it was distressed.

'It is very tragic, you feel for the family.'

Debris: The aircraft is believed to be a Robinson R22 two seater, single engined helicopter and was being flown solo from Kent to Lincolnshire

Cambridgeshire Constabulary confirmed that a man from Kent died in the crash and his next of kin have been informed.

Speaking from the field where the fatal helicopter crash took place, Chief Insp Dave Sargent said: 'The wreckage will be removed from the field sometime tomorrow afternoon.

'The debris from the crash is spread out over about half-a-mile and the blades have come off the helicopter.

'The helicopter appears to have flipped over and is lying on its topside.

'The fire service were called as a precaution because some aviation fluid had leaked from the aircraft.

'We will be using emergency lighting to illuminate the area over night.'

Nothing they could do: Emergency services at the Cambridgeshire airfield - but they were unable to save the pilot

A police spokesman added: 'I can confirm that the only person on board, a man, has died in the crash.

'His next of kin in Kent have been informed and officers are providing them with support.

'I am not in a position to name the man as formal identification has not been completed.

'No one on the ground was injured. And no roads have been affected.

'The crash site has been secured pending an investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau (AAIB).'

A cordon was placed around the crash site until the AAIB had completed its investigations.

Other eye witnesses yesterday (Fri) claimed they heard a loud bang before the 'lifeless' helicopter plummeted to the ground.

John Binns, 29, a factory worker said: 'I came out of the warehouse and saw the helicopter in the air.

'It then just started dropping to the ground. it looked so odd and lifeless.

'At first I thought it might be a model but then people started rushing towards the field and I knew it was a real helicopter.'

Anthony Clark, 37, who runs a burger van was one of the first to phone emergency services following the crash.

He said: 'We just heard a loud bang and rushed out.

'Some one shouted that a helicopter had fallen out of the sky so I phoned 999 and directed them to the scene.'

Jordan Lunn, 17, who works for a cycle distribution company said: 'We did not see it crash but we saw the aftermath. There were dozens of emergency vehicles.

'We took a picture of the crash and sadly you can see a body bag a few feet away from the helicopter.

A spokesman for Marshall Airport near Cambridge confirmed that their aircraft was not involved in the incident.
