Pilot Jon Orders says he swallowed the video memory card in a panic

A hang-gliding instructor has apologised to the family of a young woman who fell to her death in an accident in Canada admitting he 'failed in a major way.'

William 'Jon' Orders said he was sorry for swallowing a memory card that contained footage of the young woman's last moments.

He has appeared in a Vancouver court charged with obstructing the course of justice after he admitted swallowing the memory card of 27-year-old Lenami Godinez-Avila plummeting to her death.

Orders, 50, has vowed to give up hang gliding after saying he was 'sincerely and deeply sorry' for the death of Avila.

Orders was filming the Canadian woman from a camera attached to his helmet as she slipped from the harness on the tandem hang-glider he was piloting.

She tried to hold on to Orders' legs but fell 300m when his shoe came off.

He said his impulsive behaviour was due to 'overwhelming stress' that included his awaiting 12-year-old daughter on the field where the tandem flight was supposed to land.

'I would like to apologise to Lenami's family, to the police and the public for my panicked action of swallowing the memory card as I did,' said Orders.

'My 12-year-old daughter was present that day and made the situation even more stressful at the time.'

Orders was arrested two days after 
the April 28 accident and held in custody for a week while lawyers and 
police waited for him to pass the memory card.

Nicole
McLearn who was there the day Lenami died said she and her boyfriend were 'joyous'
as they watched the other hang gliders take to the air, growing excited
about their turn.

She told the Post Media News that as soon as she and Orders became airbound, it was clear something was wrong.

She said: 'I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down
the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and 
obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off 
the tandem pilot's shoes in the process.'

Usually an instructor and the student
should be side by side, but Lenami was below him and it became obvious 
she was not hooked in.

She was only in the air about 30 seconds before she died.

At the launch site, her boyfriend watched what was happening and screamed as she fell: 'No! Lenami! Hang on! I love you!'

Earlier this week, Royal Canadian Mounted Police told a court that X-rays showed the card was inside Orders' body.

But officers have confirmed that they now have the card.

'We
have processes in place in order to try and extract what's been on the 
card that will not be further discussed at the moment,' Police Constable
Tracy Wolbeck said.

Ms Wolbeck said police were focusing on answering questions from Miss Godinez-Avila's family, from Mexico.

'They've come to Canada in search of answers,' the police officer added.

Police have not provided any further details about when the card was consumed or how they learned about it.

They have also said they have seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground.

Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience.

His business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip.

When police announced the charge, they said Orders was accused of withholding key evidence.

The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley.

Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider.

Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her.

Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an 
administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang 
gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary.

He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell.
