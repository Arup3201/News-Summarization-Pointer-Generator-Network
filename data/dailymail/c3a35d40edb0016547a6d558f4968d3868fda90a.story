A woman seemed to experience a brain snap after she couldn't get any cash out of the ATM prompting her to tear apart the machine with her own hands.

The lady created quite a scene in a shopping mall in Dongguan in the Chinese province of Guangdong when she astoundingly dismantled the machine within a matter of minutes.

The extreme behaviour drew an intrigued crowd of shoppers to gather around and watch the strange event unfold while taking photos on their phones.

CCTV footage showed she managed to disassemble the machine within a matter of minutes

A crowd gathered, including a security guard, and watched on while police were called

However, despite at least three security guards attending the bizarre scene - no one attempted to stop the woman from damaging the machine. 

The woman was seen mumbling to herself and hitting the machine at the Shilong Jingshawan Shopping Mall at 5.50pm on October 16, a centre representative told the Southern Metropolis Daily, according to the China Smack website.

The representative said that the security guards were called to the scene after reports of the woman pulling apart the machine within a 'short few minutes'. 

'We can see from the mall's security cameras that she first pried off the plastic frame/case off the sides of the ATM, and then forcefully tore out the computer display,' the representative said.

'After dismantling the machine, she even stood there as if nothing had happened, but was then taken back to the police station once police arrived.' 

The woman told police that she had repeatedly tried to make withdraw money from the machine

There ended up being three security guards keeping an eye on the situation as the woman just stood back and looked at her destruction

The woman told the officers that she repeatedly tried to withdraw money from the ATM without success.

The representative said the footage showed she did not use any tools to pull apart the machine.

One possibility for the woman able to dismantle a machine so easily might be the ATM had been in service for a long time and that 'the plastic casing surrounding it has become old and brittle, and was therefore easy to damage,' the spokesperson said.
