A Seventies rock star has barricaded himself inside his loft after he became locked in a bitter mortgage dispute with his building society - which is trying to sell his home.

Former Wishbone Ash bass player, Mervyn Spence, claims he has been holed up in the attic of his £225,000 barn conversion in Lichfield, Staffordshire, since last Thursday.

The 55-year-old found himself unable to meet the £1,400-a-month mortgage repayments to the Nationwide Building Society after hitting money troubles in 2008.

He had organised an outdoor event, which had to be cancelled because of flooding, and was left paying out £150,000 in refunds.

Mr Spence said his losses meant he was unable to get a mortgage with another company so he was effectively locked into his Nationwide deal.

He claimed the building society had refused to budge on his interest rate of 5.5 per cent and was now selling the property for £160,000, which was £65,000 less than the offer accepted in 2013.

The father-of-two even sold two of his prized guitars in 2010 to keep up with his repayments before he fell further behind in 2013.

Nationwide then took him to court in January last year and a judge ruled they had the right to sell the two-bedroom detached house, where he lives on his own.

The singer-songwriter, who was also a former member of 1970s band Trapeze, alleged that Nationwide sent in a 'team of heavies' to 'clear his home out' and lock the front door, last week.

Friends have been keeping him topped up with food and he is writing songs on his guitar to keep his spirits up in the attic, which he uses as a recording studio. 

He claims he had been 'scammed' by Nationwide and said he would stay at his home until he was dragged out.

'I had always been on a tracker mortgage and Nationwide phoned me up and said "we will put you on a normal rate" in 2008,' he said.

'Then the rates dropped in 2009 to an all-time low and I thought great but my rate stayed at 5.5 per cent.

'There was no leeway at all. I've asked them and I've been complaining about it while I try and keep my head above water.

'I had to sell some guitars in 2010, I had a Fender Precision which I'd had since the 1970s and sold for about £1,200 to £1,500.

'The last payments I made were at the end of 2013 but I couldn't afford to make the full £1,400.

He says he will stay in the loft until he is given £70,000 equity from property or they return the two or three percent 'they have taken since 2008'

'My name is on the property but a court ruled in favour of Nationwide that they have got the right to sell the property.

'I was scammed, my head was full of other things because I had £150,000 commitments to make, the last thing I thought about was the best mortgage deal.

'I put a bag together and have been in the attic since last week when they locked the house.

'There is no heating so it has been freezing but I keep my spirits up playing the guitar and writing songs.

'Friends have been helping me out and I'm eating sandwiches and fruit.

'If they drag me out of here which I'm sure it will come to at some stage I will be back down to their head office protesting.

'I hold them responsible and if they are going to make me homeless then I will become their responsibility.' 

He added: 'I want to do a deal. I either want them to give me the equity out of the property as it was valued, which would give me abut £70,000.

British rock band Wishbone Ash first rose to fame in 1970 with their debut self-titled album.

They were formed in Torquay, Devon, out of the ashes of The Empty Vessels, which had been put together by founding member Martin Turner in 1963. 

Other members included Andy Powell and Ted Turner. The line-up would change several times over the years as members came and went. 

The band was considered to be one of the pioneers of using twin lead guitars.

Popular records included Pilgrimage (1971), Argus (1972), There's the Rub (1974), and New England (1976).

Wishbone Ash remained successful into the 80s and the original line-up reformed for a string of albums in 1987.

Last year the band released its 24th studio album and the current line-up, which has been together since 2007, is the band's longest standing.

The current members include original Andy Powell, Bob Skeat, Muddy Manninen and Joe Crabtree.

'I'm going to stay here as long as it takes. I don't care how much I stink, I'm prepared to be a rebel with a kind heart.' 

The singer, who joined Trapeze in 1982 before joining Wishbone Ash a year later, previously protested by busking outside Nationwide's headquarters in Swindon for three nights in November.

He has now said he would do the same thing in Birmingham if his attic-bound resistance was not effective.

Nationwide said it had tried to come to a workable solution with Mr Spence since his account fell into arrears in 2010 and added that his rate was 'completely fair and reasonable'.

A spokesman said the firm had already gone 'above and beyond what would be expected of a reasonable lender and have made numerous attempts to accommodate Mr Spence and to find a solution which works for him and for the society.'

The spokesman added: 'We have shown significant forbearance over a long period of time and have tried to do our best for Mr Spence.

'We do, though, owe it to our wider membership to ensure we do not sustain losses from such situations as this as, over time, this will affect the viability and sustainability of their building society.

'We are on Mr Spence's side but, for the wider membership, we need to be on their side too, and we will make sure we are.'
