Thousands of people got on their bikes and cycled around London's iconic streets which were closed off to cars.

Up to 50,000 people of all ages, shapes and sizes took to the saddle to enjoy an eight-mile traffic-free route that took in many of London's most famous landmarks.

Further races were going on last night while London mayor Boris Johnson will take part in a 100-mile road race today.

The Prudential RideLondon festival weekend, which is billed as the UK's largest mass participation cycling festival, takes place a year on from Team GB's gold rush on the road and in the velodrome at the London Games.

Among those taking part today was 91-year-old Betty Tingle who brought four generations of her family along with her for the ride.

Mrs Tingle, who has enjoyed cycling since the 1920s and was once a competitive rider, said: 'I've been cycling all my life, so it's fantastic to see all these people here.

'I met my husband through cycling. He used to wait for me to catch him up, now all my family are at it.Mrs Tingle, from Uckfield, East Sussex, was accompanied by 16 members of her family including her youngest daughter, Annette Woodrow.

Ms Woodrow described the event as 'fantastic'.

'For me it's part of the London legacy. I thought the cycling at the Olympic Games was very inspirational, and this is a great way of giving people a chance to cycle.

'It shows that if the traffic is gone, people will come out on their bikes. It shows if we create more cycle paths, routes to schools, paths in parks and so on, then people do want to cycle more.'

Also taking part was Marcus Hancock, 40, who had travelled from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.'It's been a brilliant day, I've never seen so many cyclists before in my life, he said.

'It was a bit crazy at the start but overall it was really, really good.

Mr Hancock, a technical director for an aerospace company, said he was also competing in the 100-mile race tomorrow so today's ride was 'just a little legwarmer'.

He added: 'I hope they make it an annual event because it was really a lot of fun, there lots of custom bikes which was really good to see. A lot of people on Boris bikes and a lot of people that obviously don't cycle very much but it was great to see them out.' 

The FreeCycle event saw men, women and children take to tricycles and tandems, mountain bikes and penny farthings, many of which had been specially customised and decorated for the occasion.

Earlier cyclists attempted to break the world record for the longest single parade of bikes, but unfortunately failed when not enough people turned up for the early start.

This evening double Olympic gold medal-winner Laura Trott won the women's criterium race after going head-to-head with her cycling teammates Dani King, Joanna Rowsell and Elinor Barker.

The Grand Prix, which saw competitors race a circuit in and around St James's Park, also featured an contest between the world's best junior cyclists while the capital's Paralympic legacy was celebrated with a handcycle race.

Tomorrow more than 50,000 competitors will take part in a 100-mile road race on a route that starts in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London, scene of last year's Games, before taking them into the Surrey countryside.

Rugby World Cup winner Matt Dawson, two-time Olympic rowing champion James Cracknell, former Olympic champion sprint hurdler Sally Gunnell and actor Gary Kemp are among the famous faces taking part.

Mr Johnson said: 'Last year it was our Olympic and Paralympic heroes taking to the capital's roads, this year a phenomenal 50,000 amateur cyclists, young and old, have followed in their tracks through central London.

'The enthusiasm of everyone who took part is spurring me on for the ride of my life tomorrow in the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100.' 

The event will finish on The Mall shortly before 150 professional cyclists race in the inaugural Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic on a similar route.

It is hoped the two-day Prudential RideLondon festival will boost the number of active cyclists in the UK, attract hundreds of thousands of visitors to London and Surrey, and raise large amounts of money for charity.
