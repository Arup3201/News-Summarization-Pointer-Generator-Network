Southampton star Graziano Pelle has compared himself with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and claimed he is better looking than Cristiano Ronaldo.

Pelle also felt Hollywood star George Clooney would be the actor most suited to playing him in a film.

When asked in his book, Pelle Talks, 1000 Questions and More, who is more attractive between himself and Real Madrid star Ronaldo, the St Mary's favourite said: 'Me. Cristiano is good looking but I am a little bit taller.'

And which player he would compare himself with? 'Zlatan. I don't say I am as good as he is but I do look like him.'
