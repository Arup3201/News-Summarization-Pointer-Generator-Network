A toddler in northeast Ohio was  left alone in the back seat of a freezing car for around 90 minutes while his father and babysitter overdosed on heroin, authorities say.

Christopher McGarr, 25, and Tiffany Lovejoy, 28, of Coventry Township are now facing jail time with child endangerment charges.

They had reportedly parked at a gas station before their drug binge on Sunday around 5:15pm and an employee at the outlet informed police. 

Christopher McGarr, 25 (right) , and his son's babysitter Tiffany Lovejoy, 28, (left) have been charged with child endangerment after allegedly overdosing on heroin and leaving McGarr's toddler  in the back of a freezing car

Their vehicle was spotted sitting stationary at a gas pump with no sign of movement.

According to a deputy's report obtained by Northeast Ohio Media Group, McGarr was found in the driver's seat with a needle in his left arm and shoestring around his bicep. A second syringe was discovered in his lap.

Lovejoy had also reportedly passed out from using heroin with a small amount of marijuana  in her purse.

McGarr's three-year-old son was said to be alone in the back of the vehicle without a car seat.

It's not clear when McGarr and Lovejoy regained consciousness.

An employee of the Marathon gas station in Coventry Township (seen above) reportedly called police around 5:15pm on Sunday after noticing the pair's vehicle had been parked at fuel pump for about 90 minutes

The couple were taken to the Summit County Jail and charged with felony child endangering.

McGarr's bond was set at $10,000 on Tuesday. 

Lovejoy is scheduled for an initial court hearing on Wednesday.

Court documents list no attorneys for the couple.

The child was released to his grandmother by child services after being checked for symptoms of hypothermia.
