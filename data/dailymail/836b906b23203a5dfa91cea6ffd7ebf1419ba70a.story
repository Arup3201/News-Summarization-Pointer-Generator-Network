A skin cancer warning has been sounded following evidence some big brand sun creams do not offer the protection they claim to give.

As temperatures are predicted to hit the mid-70s this weekend, products by Malibu, Piz Buin and Hawaiian Tropic have been given a ‘don’t buy’ rating by independent reviewer Which?.

The consumer champion tested 15 popular sun creams that claimed to have a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30, as well as helping to shield the skin from UVA rays.

The three 
which failed were found to have a real SPF level of less than 25, while 
the Malibu product also fell short of the required UVA standard.

Sun exposure is linked to premature ageing and skin cancer, with evidence of 100,000 cases being diagnosed in the UK each year.

Which?
 found that paying a high price is no guarantee of better protection, 
with the most expensive brand outperformed by a cheap rival.

Piz
 Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Sun Fluid SPF30, which failed the SPF test, 
was the most expensive cream tested, at £11.30 per 100ml. Calypso Sun 
Lotion SPF30, which was £1.20 per 100ml, passed both tests.

 executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘We’ve found three products that
 failed the strict British Standard tests and we want to see 
manufacturers doing much more to make sure their sun creams live up to 
the claims on the packaging.’

All the companies behind the brands criticised by Which? insist the products meet the protection levels claimed on the packs.

Researchers
 tested the creams on ten volunteers, who had the same amount of each 
product applied to a small area of their back before lying under a lamp 
to replicate the sun’s rays. Their skin was checked for redness and 
compared to the results of a lamp test with no cream.

SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer – 150 minutes.

While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin’s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer.

The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF. The Malibu product failed to meet this standard.

The World Health Organisation advises applying 35ml of sun cream. That equates to seven teaspoons – one for the head and neck, one for each arm and leg, and one each for the chest and back. It suggests users re-apply every two hours.

Which? said: ‘A sunscreen that doesn’t offer the protection it claims could expose you to a greater risk of developing sunburn than one that meets its claim, as you will be getting less protection than you think.’

Malibu said: ‘We stand by our testing … We have nothing to hide.’

Piz Buin said all of its products are assessed in compliance with EU regulations and that it is confident its products provide the protection stated.

Hawaiian Tropic said it only sells products that meet the SPF figure claimed on the pack.

As summer arrives at last, nature is waking up to celebrate.

The glorious weather expected this weekend comes after a mild and wet winter that has provided perfect conditions for plants and wildlife to thrive.

As a result, many species are stirring earlier than expected. Elderflowers are in flower, dog roses are blooming and hawthorn is at a peak – a situation not usually seen until June.

Far more butterflies have also hatched than would usually be seen at this time of year.

Most of Britain will be bathed in sunshine at the weekend as the mercury hits its record for the year.

There will be barely a cloud in the sky for long spells as temperatures reach a sweltering 25C (77F), warmer than many parts of the Mediterranean and much hotter than the 16C (61F) average for May.

The hot spell will last until Monday but will break before the Chelsea Flower Show starts on Tuesday, with unsettled weather expected for much of next week.

National Trust naturalist Matthew Oates said: ‘It’s an early summer because of the mild, wet and stormy winter, and the whole thing’s rather jumped the gun.’

He added: ‘If the jet stream is kind to us, it could be a really wonderful summer.’
