The Right Reverend Michael Perham, who stepped down as Bishop of Gloucester at the weekend, has been questioned by police on suspicion of indecently assaulting a girl and a woman

A senior bishop has been questioned by police on suspicion of indecently assaulting a girl and a woman.

The Right Reverend Michael Perham, who stepped down as Bishop of Gloucester over the weekend after more than 10 years in the role, was not arrested but interviewed under caution.

He was due to retire in November but withdrew from his role citing 'personal reasons'.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm a 66-year-old man today attended a police building in Gloucestershire by appointment where he was interviewed under caution on suspicion of indecent assault on a child aged under 18 years; and indecent assault on a second female, aged over 18 years.

'He was not arrested.

'The alleged incidents are said to have occurred between 1980 and 1981 and are being investigated by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. Inquiries continue.'

A spokesman for the Diocese of Gloucester said: 'This is a police matter. We have no further comment to make.'

In a statement on Saturday, the Diocese of Gloucester confirmed Bishop Perham had 'stepped back' from his ministry due to 'personal reasons'.

When announcing his retirement last year, he said the 'time was right for him and his family'.

A special service was due to take place on November 8 to celebrate his time as Bishop of Gloucester.

Over the weekend church officials said they 'did not know' whether this was still going ahead or not.

It is unknown if a special service, due to take place at Gloucester Cathedral, pictured, to commemorate his time as Bishop of Gloucester will go ahead

According to the diocese’s website Bishop Perham is married and has four grown-up daughters.

It says: 'He has been best known for his work on the Church’s worship. He served on the Church of England Liturgical Commission from 1982 to 2001, being one of the principal architects of its Common Worship services.

'He is now a member of the House of Lords and of the House of Bishops’ Standing Committee.

'He has been a strong advocate of the role of women in the Church as priests and bishops.

'He is married to Dr Alison Grove, who is a palliative care consultant. They have four grown up daughters.'
