The Church of England could have its first woman bishop by 2015 after opponents backed down following months of pressure from politicians.

Members of the General Synod, the church’s ruling body, yesterday voted by 378-8 in favour of plans that will pave the way for women to be promoted to the senior rank within two years.

Referring to the failure of opponents to win public support, Canon Rosie Harper, of Oxford, said in the Synod debate: ‘People out there don’t care enough to be angry, but they do dismiss us as weird. If we are serious about our mission, we really have to stop being weird.’

Changes: Canon Rosie Harper, who made a speech during the Synod, said people outside the church thought the ongoing argument over discrimination was 'weird'

Under the scheme, an ombudsman will 
decide on disputes when traditionalists refuse to accept a woman 
bishop’s authority. Clergy who fail to abide by the advice will face 
disciplinary action.

Yesterday’s vote was almost exactly a 
year since an alliance of conservative evangelicals and Anglo-Catholics 
voted to halt the progress of women bishops.

The ‘train crash’ vote, as one Church 
leader called it, provoked threats from ministers to force the Church’s 
hand and a warning from David Cameron that the Church needed ‘a sharp 
prod’.

Yesterday, David Cameron told MPs that
he hoped women would soon be joining the 26 Church of England bishops 
in the House of Lords.

The Archbishop of York, the Most 
Reverend John Sentamu, warned against premature celebrations because the
plans must pass a final vote next year.

Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: ‘We can be cautiously hopeful of good progress.’

The 
Bishop of Rochester, the Rt Rev 
James Langstaff, said the result was not a cause for complacency and 
reminded members the battle to push through the legislation was not 
over.

'There
is a lot of work still to be done. People will have voted in favour of 
this to continue the process who may or may not vote in favour of the 
package at the end of the day', he said.

'So it is not over and that is a reality.'

David Cameron also said he would fast track 
women Bishops into the Lords to give them a presence in 
parliament 'as soon as possible'.

Responding to a question in the Commons today, the Prime Minister said: 'I strongly support women bishops and I hope the Church of England takes this key step to ensure its place as a modern church, in touch with our society.'

The vote could pave the way for final approval of women bishops by the General Synod in July next year.

The move follows bitter recriminations
within the Church of England after the legislation failed by just six 
votes to get approval at the General Synod a year ago.

Several General Synod members spoke of the marked improvement in the atmosphere since the collapse of the legislation last year.

The
Rt Rev Christopher Chessun, Bishop of Southwark, said: 'From where we 
are today, compared to where we were a year ago, it is as someone said 
to me the other day "nothing short of miraculous".'

The
Rev Rod Thomas, chairman of Reform, the conservative evangelical 
grouping, and a member of the steering committee which drew up the 
proposals, paid tribute to the 'generosity of spirit' which had led to 
the package.

Overwhelming: Members of the General Synod overwhelmingly endorsed women bishops with 378 voting in favour and eight against with 25 abstentions

But he said there were still problems over the proposals, including the issue of authority of women bishops where parishes seek alternative arrangements.

'I am very conscious indeed of last November when people like me voted against the draft measure, it was a cause of shock, bewilderment and anger and much grief,' he said.

'Therefore to be able to sit down and talk with people who have experienced those emotions and talk constructively about ways by which we might find agreement has been a very uplifting process.'

Pledge: David Cameron said he would give women bishops a presence in parliament 'as soon as possible'

Prebendary David Houlding, a leading Anglo-Catholic Synod member, from London, declared that the 'battle is surely over'.

'What we have in front of us works, and it works for all of us, no matter where we are coming from on this matter,' he said.

Christina Rees, a vocal supporter of women bishops, spoke of her amazement at the change of atmosphere in the General Synod.

'If anyone had told me that, one year on from last November, we would be where we are, I would have said ‘That is impossible’ but by the grace of God it has been possible.'

But director of Reform Susie Leafe, a member of the steering committee who voted to abstain on commending the package, said she could not vote in favour of the motion.

'We claim that this package is designed to enable all to flourish yet I and my church can only flourish when we deny our theological convictions and accept a woman as our chief pastor.'
