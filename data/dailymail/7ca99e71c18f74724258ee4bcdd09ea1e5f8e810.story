Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella believes they have pulled off quite a coup in coaxing Mohamed Salah from Chelsea, having lost star turn Juan Cuadrado to the west London club.

Impressive performances for club and country saw the Blues fork out £26.8million to bring the World Cup star from the Stadio Artemio Franchi to Stamford Bridge earlier this month.

Cuadrado's deadline-day move to west London paved the way for Salah to go the other way, having endured a frustrating first year at Stamford Bridge.

The sale of their star Juan Cuadrado to the west London club is also something for Fiorentina to be proud of

The Egypt international will spend the rest of the campaign on loan at Fiorentina, for whom he netted one and provided another in Saturday's 3-1 win at Sassuolo - a display Montella believes is just the start.

'Well, I think we pulled off a bit of coup ourselves in signing Salah,' the former Fulham loanee said ahead of their Europa League tie with Tottenham.

'Joking aside, it is almost a sign of professional pride that someone wanted to pay so much for Cuadrado and that he developed so much as a player.

'He certainly wasn't at that level when he first arrived to play for us, so I think us, the management, the players are very proud about how far he has been able to go with our help.

Montella says Cuadrado wasn't a £26.8m-worthy player when he first arrived at the Italian club

'But we haven't just replaced him with one player, we have replaced him with several players.

'Salah is a very good player, he is used to playing at this level and although he has only been with us a short while, he has already shown very quickly that he is certainly up to playing very well in Italy and playing well for us.'

Montella's side are flying right now, arriving in north London with a Coppa Italia semi-final to look forward to and their hopes of Champions League qualification alive. 

Salah is one of several players Fiorentina have brought in with the fee from Chelsea for the Colombian

Spurs, too, have enjoyed an impressive time of late, thanks in no small part to the exquisite form of homegrown star Harry Kane.

The 21-year-old's incredible progress makes him a shoe-in for the next England squad and has caught the attention of Fiorentina captain Manuel Pasqual ahead of the last-32 first leg tie.

'We have seen him the way that he has exploded onto the scene and no doubt that he is one of their best players,' the defender said.

'We know he is a goalscorer and he need to mark him as best we can and try to stop him scoring.'
