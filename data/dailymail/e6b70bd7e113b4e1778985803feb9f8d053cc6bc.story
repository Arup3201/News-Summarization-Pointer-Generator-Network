Five men are to appear in court this month to face football banning order hearings after a video which showed Chelsea fans being racially abusive to a black on on the Paris Metro went viral.

Police said each of the men, who have not been named, have been served a summons and will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'.

Chelsea fans sparked outrage last month when they were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a train ahead of a Champions League match against Paris St Germain.

A Metropolitan Police statement said the summonses were served today and yesterday.

Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or a local police force, the Home Office website says.

They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison.

Footage captured by a bystander before Chelsea drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-Germain appeared to show a man being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'.

The commuter, Souleymane Sylla, 33, (pictured) said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'

The commuter, identified only as 33-year-old Souleymane, said later he felt 'truly wounded to the bottom of my heart'.

He said: 'We're in 2015, aren't we, and we're in France. We're in a civilised country and when you are in a civilised country there are certain things you can't do.

'For me, it's a humiliation. I was humiliated in my country. I was humiliated in front of my family, humiliated in front of my mother and father.'

The development comes on the day that the two teams meet in the return leg of the tie in London. 

They will compete for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium tonight.  

Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved.

Five people have also been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident.

The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.
