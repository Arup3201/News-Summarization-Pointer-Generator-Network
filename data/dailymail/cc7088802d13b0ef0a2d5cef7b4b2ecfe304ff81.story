A clear mandate has been handed down to householders allowing them to use whatever force is necessary to defend their homes and families from intruders.

The unequivocal message came as wealthy businessman Vincent Cooke, 39, was told he would face no charges for stabbing a burglar to death.

The married father was arrested on suspicion of murder last month after he knifed career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, during a terrifying armed raid.

He is the third householder this year to kill an intruder and be told he will not face prosecution.

The decision sends out an emphatic message that victims of aggravated burglary will be given the support of the British legal system.

And it paves the way for the new Justice Bill to put beyond doubt the right of homeowners and shopkeepers to use force to protect themselves, their families and their property without fear of prosecution.

Yesterday lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service ruled that 39-year-old Mr Cooke acted within the law.

Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the North West, said: 'It is clear to me that Mr Cooke did what he honestly and instinctively believed was necessary to protect himself, his home and his family from intruders.

'The law is clear that anyone, who acts in good faith in using whatever force they honestly feel is necessary to protect themselves, their families or their property, will not be prosecuted.'

Two men burst into Mr Cooke's £350,000 detached home in the village of Bramhall, Cheshire, last month.

They marched him upstairs at knifepoint hunting for money but as they ransacked the house, Mr Cooke's wife, Karen, 34, and son Anthony, 12, returned home.

Mr Cooke shouted at them to run for safety and grabbed a kitchen knife before struggling with the intruders.

During the scuffle Jacob suffered multiple stab wounds and bled to death on the doorstep from a leg wound.

The family have been forced to leave their home over fears underworld associates of Jacob may seek revenge.

Yesterday Mr Cooke, the boss of a courier firm, spoke of his relief that he would not face prosecution but said the incident had left him traumatised.

He said: 'I'm still suffering flashbacks and having nightmares every night. I will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life.

'I would like to convey my utmost thanks for all the people who have supported me throughout this horrible experience.'

Mr Cooke received wide-ranging support across the political spectrum after his ordeal and more than 6,000 joined a Facebook campaign.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'The law is very clear: you have every right to defend yourself, your home, your property, your family.'

Michael Thorpe, 33, has been remanded in custody charged with aggravated burglary at Mr Cooke's home. In July, 59-year-old Peter Flanagan, of Salford, who was accused of stabbing to death suspected burglar John Bennell, 27, escaped charges.

And last month the CPS decided no charges should be brought against florist Cecil Coley, 72, who was arrested after a gang of armed robbers – one with a handgun – smashed their way into his shop in Old Trafford, Manchester.

Armed robber Gary Mullings, 30, suffered fatal wounds when Mr Coley picked up a knife used for cutting flowers and stabbed him during a frantic struggle at the shop.
