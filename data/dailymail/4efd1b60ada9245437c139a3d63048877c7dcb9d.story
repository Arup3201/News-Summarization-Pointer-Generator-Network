Four more juveniles have been arrested following the death of a man found 'badly beaten' at his home.

Detectives today named the man as 42-year-old Warren Free who was found unconscious when emergency crews arrived at his house in Spalding, Lincolnshire.

A boy and girl aged 13 and another 15-year-old girl were arrested in connection with the murder inquiry.

Emergency services were sent to Coronation Close in Spalding, Lincolnshire, after the 42-year-old man was found unconscious. Three children under the age of 15 have now been arrested for murder 

Of those three juveniles already arrested, one girl has been released on police bail and the other boy and girl remain in custody being interviewed.

A further four juvenile boys have now been arrested in connection with the murder inquiry.

Mr Free was airlifted to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre on Thursday, but died in the early hours of Friday morning.

There continues to be a significant police presence in the Coronation Close area of Spalding, where Mr Free had lived with his 12-year-old son.

A neighbour suggested yesterday that Mr Free's son was at home when he was attacked.

Gena Probert, 85, who lived next door, said: 'It is a terrible thing to happen. I only knew him as Warren and he was a sweet man and wouldn't hurt a fly.

'I was woken up by the sound of someone running down the street at about 1am in the morning but didn't think too much of it until I saw police and ambulance at Warren's house the next day.

'I saw him being dragged out on a stretcher with a blanket over him, he was absolutely covered in blood. I couldn't even make out his face, he was that badly beaten.

'The air ambulance came down in the skate park but there were delays in it taking off because the paramedics couldn't get him stable.

'The police came to see me and said a girl and a boy aged 13 were suspected of breaking into his house and another 15-year-old was also arrested.

'He used to 
come round and have a coffee or a can of coke and sit and chat to me. He
 would often take my bins out of get me a pint of milk or paper from the
 shop if I couldn't go out.

'I
 feel awful about what has happened. This is a very close-knit community
 and we look out for each other. I will miss Warren terribly.'

The victim was airlifted to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham but died in the early hours of this morning

An elderly neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Warren had a 12-year-old son and a daughter that lives in Wales. She was about 20.' It is understood that his mother and father moved to Portugal a few months ago.

'He didn't work. What he told us a long time ago was that he was beaten badly in Wales and that's the reason why he moved here.'

Another neighbour added: 'He kept himself to himself. I spoke to him but that's about all.

'He used to walk past with his son. I spoke to him one time where he said he came from Reading, moved to Wales, and then came here. He was a friendly chap.

'The police asked us to look after the son (on Thursday) while they tried to find him somewhere to stay.

'He stopped here with us for a couple of hours. He must be 12 or 13.

'Warren's parents live in Portugal but I saw them when they came to visit Warren.'

Detectives from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, Major Crime Branch, are leading the murder inquiry and officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries in Coronation Close.

Inspector Jim Tyner, community policing inspector for Spalding, said: 'Coronation Close is a close-knit community and I know many will be affected by what has happened.

'My officers will be carrying out extra patrols in the area and I would urge residents to approach them with any concerns.'

Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Martin Holvey, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, added last night: 'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances in which Mr Free sustained the injuries that led to his subsequent death and I am appealing to anyone with information that may assist the enquiry to contact the major incident room by calling 101 and quoting incident 161 of 28th August.'

An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'A fast response vehicle was first on the scene and requested immediate back-up from a double-crewed ambulance and Helimed.

'The air ambulance arrived with a doctor on board and flew the patient to Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.'
