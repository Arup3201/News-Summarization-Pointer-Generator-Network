A secret phone recording released on Monday shows an NFL exec promising Adrian Peterson he would be suspended for just two games, rather than indefinitely, the player's lawyers claim.

The audio, obtained by ABC News, apparently backs up the Minnesota Vikings star's claims that the league promised he would return to the field shortly after pleading no contest to assaulting his four-year-old son. Instead, six days later, he was suspended without pay until at least April 15, 2015.

The audio emerged on Monday as the NFL Players Association filed a federal lawsuit in Minnesota on behalf of Peterson, asking the court to dismiss the decision to uphold his punishment.

In the conversation, which was recorded on November 12, he is speaking on the phone with Troy Vincent, the NFL executive vice president of football operations. 

Anger: Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, pictured last month after pleading no contest for assaulting his son, has said a league exec promised him he could return to the field after just two games

At one point, Peterson says: 'I get two games.'

'Yeah,' Vincent responds.

The football star continues: 'It will be two additional games, not time served.'

On tape: Troy Vincent, executive vice president of football operations, denied making any promises

'No, no, it won't,' Vincent replies. 'The one this weekend. So really, it's just next week and you - you're rolling. You're back.'

Again, Peterson asks: 'Two games?'

'Yeah that is if you - you cannot - you gotta just go through the process,' Vincent says.

'I gave my word the other day. I think we looked at each other and in my heart I'm praying that we can just get your family restored and just get you back on the field so you can continue to be the ball player, the citizen, the father, the husband that God's called you to be.

'You've done a lot, paid the price, and I think everybody understands that.'

Before Peterson's suspension was upheld on Friday, the promise was at the crux of the NFL Players Association argument that he should be reinstated.   

The union claimed Vincent told Peterson he would receive the shorter ban if he attended a hearing on with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on November 14.

But Peterson, 29, declined to meet that day with Goodell, citing uncertainty about the NFL's intent to question him. Goodell then announced the suspension on November 18.

The union gave the recording to the case's arbitrator, Harold Henderson, who oversaw a hearing on December 2.

Vincent was questioned, but Henderson concluded Peterson was not retaliated against for not going to meet with Goodell.

Not backing off: The decision by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, pictured announcing new measures for the NFL's personal conduct policy last week, to suspend Peterson indefinitely was upheld on Friday

'Mr. Vincent testified that he never promised a two-game suspension or that the old policy would control, but rather encouraged Mr. Peterson to "go through the process and all things will be considered",' Henderson wrote.

'He said, "I didn't promise Adrian anything. Never promised. Adrian needed to show up. Talk".' 

Peterson has been suspended from the league until at least April 15, 2015 for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son. The boy was left with lacerations across his body. 

The football player, who has six children, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault in Texas on November 4 for probation time, community service and a small fine.

He acknowledged physically disciplining the boy as he had been as a youth, but he said he meant no harm and was sorry for the trouble he caused.

'I love my son more than any of you can imagine,' he said outside the courthouse that day.

Although avoided jail time and a felony conviction, he has been fined more than $4.1 million as part of the punishment from the NFL - the cost of the six-game suspension.

On Friday, the suspension was upheld as arbitrator Harold Henderson called it arguably one of the most egregious cases of domestic violence' in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's nine-year tenure. 

In response, the NFL Players Association said it expected the outcome 'given the hearing officer's relationship and financial ties to the NFL'.

Hurt: Peterson was charged with misdemeanor reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline his four-year-old son, leaving him with lacerations (pictured). Peterson has apologized

Determined: Peterson, who was named as MVP in 2012, has missed six games for the Vikings this season, meaning he has missed out of $4 million in pay. He said he is considering retiring from the NFL

'The decision itself ignores the facts, the evidence and the collective bargaining agreement,' it continued. 'This decision also represents the NFL's repeated failure to adhere to due process and confirms its inconsistent treatment of players. Our union is considering immediate legal remedies.'  

Henderson's announcement was a decisive victory for Goodell, whose authority was overruled last month by the arbitrator in the case of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice. Rice was reinstated, but he had no team to return to because the Ravens released him a week into the season.

The union's grievance for Peterson was similar, arguing essentially that Goodell was making up protocol for discipline as he went along. But Henderson forcefully wrote that he saw no bounds being overstepped by the league boss. 

The Vikings declined to comment.  

Peterson has told ESPN.com that he might walk away from the game, possibly even trying to run in the 2016 Olympics.

'I've considered retiring from the NFL,' Peterson said. 'I still made $8 million this year. ... I've thought about going after the Olympics. You only live once. It might be time for me to pursue that.'
