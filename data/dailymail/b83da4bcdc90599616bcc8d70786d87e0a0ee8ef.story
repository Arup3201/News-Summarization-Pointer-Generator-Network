We are more accustomed to seeing them on the front rows of fashion week or partying with models at uber stylish parties dressed in the latest designs.

But one artist has given the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs and Anna Wintour a very unusual make-over.

Italian artist AleXsandro Palombo has painted the iconic fashionistas blue to celebrate the Belgian comic and television sensation of 1958 and beyond: The Smurfs.

Complete with pointy white hats, googly eyes and big blue or white feet, here are the fash-pack as you've never seen them before...
