Sweden's military is probing two new observations that could be evidence of a suspected Russian submarine near the country's capital - and is prepared to do use any means necessary to force it to the surface, a military spokesperson said.

Swedish forces have been scouring the sea off Stockholm since Friday, after what the military called three credible reports of activity by foreign submarines or divers using an underwater vehicle. 

The vessels were unidentified, but during the 1980s the Swedish navy from time to time hunted suspected Soviet submarines in its waters.

'We don't know what it is,' but we 'are prepared to use anything necessary to bring the vessel to the surface if we need to,' Therese Fagerstedt told CNN.

'Today, I can report that there have been two further
observations which were made by members of the public that are
interesting enough to require further follow-up work,' Admiral
Anders Grenstad told reporters.

He would not give further details about what kind of new
sightings had been made, but said they were being assessed and
were not yet considered as credible as the three made earlier.

Grenstad said the operation was aimed at gathering
intelligence, not military action, and could continue for some
time.

'I want to stress again that this is not a U-boat hunting
operation which has the aim of bringing down an opponent with
military might,' he said.

He also said Sweden had no information as to which country
might be behind the suspected intrusion into Swedish waters. But
during the 1980s and early '90s, Sweden's defence forces
regularly played cat and mouse with suspected Soviet submarines
in its territorial waters.

Some of the incidents were later reclassified as likely to
have been false alarms.

In recent months, Swedish jets have been scrambled to meet
Russian planes crossing into the country's air space, a pattern
repeated in the Baltics where Nato has responded.

Finland has complained that Russia has violated its air
space and that the Russian navy interfered with the operations
of a state environmental research vessel in international waters
in August and September.

The incidents come as tension between Russian and the West
is rising in the region over the conflict in Ukraine. In a joint
press conference on Tuesday with the leader of Estonia, Sweden's
prime minister said his country would increase spending on
defence.
