Authors Jonathan Safron Foer and Nicole Krauss have called it quits on their 10 year marriage.

A rep for the literary power couple confirmed that they 'split amicably a year ago', according to The New York Post, and 'have chosen to live in close proximity in order to raise their [two] children.'

Last October, in what was to be a real-estate omen, the pair listed their six bedroom townhouse in Brooklyn, New York, for $14.5million, and although they have both moved out, the house remains unsold.

Once dubbed 'the too-successful-to-stomach physical embodiment of literary Brooklyn' by New York Magazine - the couple's split comes as a shock to many, as the ferociously successful author-duo appeared to enjoy a happy and stable marriage.

Mr Foer, 37, is best known for his 2009 novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which was later turned into a film starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, in 2011.

In 2012, just one year before the couple separated, Mr Foer told The Guardian that 'the best kiss of his life' was: '[The] First date with my wife, beneath a costume shop awning, in the rain.'

In the same interview, he declared that 'the love of his life', was 'life itself.'

Ms Krauss has been hailed by The New York Times as 'one of America's most important novelists', and is best known for her bestselling novel, The History of Love, which she wrote around the same time Mr Foer was writing Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.

In a signal of the pair's creative unity, the two post-modern novels have been widely noted for their similarities, in plot and in writing style. Both center around intelligent children with dead fathers solving mysteries in New York.

Mr Foer is
 also the author of the 2009 book, Eating Animals; a nonfiction which 
exposed the gruesome insides of America's meat industry. The work is now
 being made into a feature-length documentary starring self-proclaimed 
vegan, Natalie Portman. Mr Foer and Ms Krauss have raised their 
children, Sasha, eight, and Cy, five, as strict vegetarians.

Mr Foer currently teaches creative writing and the New York University, and Ms Krauss is writing short stories.
