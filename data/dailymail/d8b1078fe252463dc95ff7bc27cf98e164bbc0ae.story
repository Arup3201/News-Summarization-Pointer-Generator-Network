A woman cyclist has been left fighting for her life after being crushed by a lorry in central London this morning.

The rider, who is believed to be in her twenties, was ‘crushed’ under a large tipper truck at Ludgate Circus at about 11.30am today.

London Ambulance Service found the woman in cardiac arrest and 'extensive efforts' were made at the scene to resuscitate her.

The bike can be seen crushed under the large wheel of the truck following a collision at Ludgate Circus today

She was taken to Royal London Hospital with serious injuries, where she remains fighting for her life.

Witnesses at the scene say the cyclist was 'crushed' under the large lorry, which appeared to be turning left at the junction with Ludgate Hill and Farringdon Street.

City of London Police closed roads surrounding Ludgate Circus and re-opened them at about 5pm this evening.

The junction has become notorious for accidents - and is the second in a matter of months after Victor Manuel Ben Rodriguez was crushed under a lorry in April.

The 32-year-old Spaniard had been on his bike on the way to a job interview when he was hit by a truck and suffered severe head injuries.

London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said there had been six cyclists killed or seriously injured at the junction between 2008 and 2012.

He added that Ludgate Circus had featured on Transport for London's original list of 100 junctions which it planned to overhaul following safety concerns, but that it had not featured on a revised list of 33 junctions where work would be carried out.

People are now calling for something to be done and several have taken to Twitter in a bid to sort it out.

Twitter users have called on Mayor of London Boris Johnson to do something about the junction

Jocelyn Bailey posted: 'Just walked past an awful bike v lorry incident at Ludgate Circus. How many times does this have to happen before we sort it out?'

Callum Stott wrote: 'Horrible to hear of another HGV Vs Cyclist accident at Ludgate Circus again, sounds identical to the poor man who died there 3 months ago'.

While others directed their tweets at Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

Sammy Lizard said: 'Boris you MUST step in the junction of Fleet & Ludgate Circus a killer for #cyclists stop anything turning at the junction!'

Another tweeted him: 'another cyclist run over at Ludgate Circus. Twice in matter of months. Do something for cyclists & pedestrians.'

 The London Cycling Campaign wrote on their Facebook page: 'We're saddened to hear of a woman involved in a serious collision with an HGV at Ludgate Circus. 

'We hope for the best for the victim and our thoughts are with her and her family.'

A London Ambulance Service spokesman told the London Evening Standard: 'We were called at 11.30 to reports of a collision involving a lorry and a cyclist.

'A woman believed to be in her 20s was in cardiac arrest at the scene, and extensive efforts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken by ambulance to the Royal London Hospital as a priority.'

City Police say no arrests have been made.
