Graeme Swann is at the centre of Kevin Pietersen's allegations surrounding a culture of bullying and intimidation in the England dressing room. 

The former spinner is said to have berated youngsters for dropping catches and allowing batsman to get off the mark, demanding apologies. Swann retorted on Monday that the autobiography is a 'work of fiction.'

And, talking to BBC Radio 5Live, Pietersen says that while his bullying claims are serious - he does contextualise them in a sporting arena and does not want to compare it to everyday abuse often felt in schools and at work.  

Kevin Pietersen wants a return to the England Test team after being dumped earlier this year

'It happened and I wouldn't have written this book if I didn't think it had happened. I know that everything that's in this book, I can stand by 100 per cent.

'Swann is at the centre of this.'

Asked for an example of the stress some England players incur, Pietersen went straight to the trouble faced by Jonathan Trott. 

'Jonathan Trott lost it in Bangladesh, he started screaming at Swann and Broad because they kept going on him,' he said. 'We're supposed to be in an environment where we are able to enjoy ourselves, not be scared to take a catch or field a ball.

'I put bullying into the perspective of the England dressing room, as to how certain individuals made others feel in the dressing room.' 

Meanwhile, Pietersen has reaffirmed his desire to play for England again and maintains he has good relationship with 'everybody' in the dressing room.

The 34-year-old was unceremoniously dumped by the ECB after a humiliating Ashes whitewash last winter.

While Pietersen believes he was held up as a scapegoat in the immediate aftermath, the noises he made when talking to the BBC's Today Show on Radio 4 indicated a return could well be on the cards.

The South African-born batsman – who captained England for three Tests in 2009 – says he has no problem with Alastair Cook.

And, interestingly, Pietersen claimed he wanted to continue playing in the middle order for Peter Moores when he resigned as skipper.

Although he wants a Test match return, he barely played any four-day cricket for Surrey this summer.

'I had difficulties when I was captain. It wasn't him or me,' Pietersen said. 'I said to the ECB to let me go and bat. I couldn't tolerate captaining with Moores.

'I'd like to be batting there with guys and helping them with their games.'

Pietersen also insinuated that the current captain Cook was hung out to dry after decision taken over his head this year – including the removal of mentor Graham Gooch.

'I've got a great relationship with everybody in that team, including Cooky. They said it was his decision to get rid of Gooch… to get rid of me.'
