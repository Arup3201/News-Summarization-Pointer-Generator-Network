Nearly thirty years of New York City’s street art history was wiped out overnight Monday when a warehouse that was once the city’s graffiti Mecca was completely painted over.

Known as 5 Pointz and referred to lovingly as the United Nations of Graffiti, the Long Island City Queens warehouse was the most impressive and beloved of the few remaining spots in the city where aerosol-wielding artists could legally do their work.

The covert move came after a struggle between graffiti lovers and the building’s owner Jerry Wolkoff, whose plan to raze the landmark to build luxury condos was approved in October.

But Wolkoff’s decision to paint over the painstaking work of some 1,500 artists at night and without attempting to preserve anything at all leaves 5Pointz supporters angry and puzzled.

Then and now: A building that was known around the world as the graffiti Mecca of New York City was quietly painted over Monday night by the building's owner who plans to build condos

The final blow against the internationally known, unmistakable building visible right off Queens’ elevated 7 line train came earlier this month when a judge denied an effort by graffiti artists to stop the planned demolition.

The building’s fate had been all but sealed since October when Wolkoff, who has owned the warehouse since 1971—and actually gave the first okay that led to the creation of 5 Pointz—had his plans to knock it down in favor of profitable condos in the burgeoning Queens enclave approved.

‘This is the biggest rag and disrespect in the history of graffiti,’ a tearful Marie Cecile Flaguel, a spokeswoman for the group behind 5Pointz told the New York Times. ‘He’s painted over the work of at least 1,500 artists.’

Erased history: Seen easily from the city's busy 7 line train, the so-called United Nations of Graffiti had hosted the works of artists from around the world over nearly 30 years and had become a landmark of sorts in the borough of Queens

Humane: Jerry Wolkoff, who owns the Long Island City building says he painted over the graffiti covertly and instead of just tearing down the building because it was the 'humane' thing and would limit confrontations with graffiti lovers

'I cried this morning': Wolkoff, who actually gave the first okay that allowed the building to become graffiti Mecca 5Pointz, says he loved the place but not enough to preserve it

Flaguel was one of many who fought to preserve 5 Pointz after Wolkoff’s plans were revealed.

‘It’s like David and Goliath,’ the spokeswoman said in June. ‘What the landlord doesn’t understand is that 5Pointz is a brand and an icon, and if he knocks it down it will be missed.’

Now, that grieving process has begun.

Supporters of the iconic spot gathered Tuesday and made plans for a candlelight vigil.

Endangered species: 5Pointz was one of the last, the largest, and most iconic place in New York where graffiti artists can legally practice their art

Jerry Wolkoff purchased the complex, made up of mostly abandoned buildings at the time, that makes up 5 Pointz in 1971.

He leased space to a company that first produced record player accessories, then eight tracks, then CD cases before moving out in the early 90s, reports the New York Times.

Wolkoff then filled the void by renting studio space out to artists for a few hundred dollars per month.

He says a man at the time asked him if graffiti artists he knew could use the warehouse as a canvas. He agreed and the open air art space began to flourish as Wolkoff allowed them to use more of the warehouse's exterior.

In 2002, the by then iconic walls of Wolkoff's building became an official art space as a graffiti artist named Meres One took over the operation as curator and named it 5Pointz.

In the years since its humble inception, 5Pointz had become a international destination.

It had become a graffiti museum of sorts attracted tourists from around the world eager to see the unique spectacle.

Meres One brought in a rotating lineup of artists from areas as far as Spain, France, and Australia to add their vision to 5Pointz's history.

A particularly striking likeness of murdered rapper Biggie Smalls, an unmissable sight from the elevated 7 train, was actually painted by a New Zealand artist.

Graffiti has piled atop graffiti at 5Pointz and no one disputes the ephemeral nature of the art form.

But Wolkoff's take on the perpetual battle of the old versus the new spells the true end of 5Pointz.

Wolkoff's plan to put 2 million square feet of luxury condos was okayed by city planners in October and attempts to halt 5Pointz's demolition were struck down in court earlier this month.

'It’s time for me to put something else there,' Wolkoff told the Times, before launching into a pitch for Manhattan-adjacent development before its even begun. 'I can get you to 53rd and Fifth in 12 minutes!'

One such supporter, who gave his name as Just, just stared at the newly white walls for hours.

‘Heartbreaking. This is not just about graffiti — it’s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world. That’s what really hurts.’

Wolkoff told the Times that painting over the graffiti on the 200,000 square foot warehouse was the ‘humane’ thing to do, but admits he also did so at night to avoid confrontation.

‘I am telling you, I did not like what they did — I loved what they did,’ said Wolkoff. ‘I cried this morning, I swear to you.’

Progress? The area will soon become home to a proposed 2 million square foot development

Destination: A roster of thousands of the world's most dedicated street artists would visit 5Pointz each year to place their work, legally, among the best in the game

Wolkoff’s approved proposal laid out plans to erect two million square feet of development in a trendy area where luxury one bedroom apartments easily stretch toward $4,000 per month.

Wolkoff says his love of the artists for whom he ‘had nothing but admiration’ prompted the overnight whitewashing.

‘The last thing I want is for any of them to get arrested,’ he said.

Over the years, 5 Pointz had become an international destination for street artists in addition to its home grown fans.

Controlled chaos: More than a spot for graffiti, 5POintz actually had a curator and a rotating roster of visiting artists

Outgunned: Graffiti artists only just this month lost a legal fight to preserve 5Pointz as an historic landmark

Jerry Wolkoff, who has owned the building since 1971, was granted permission to move forward with his 2 million square foot development in trendy Long Island City, Queens back in October

While the battle to save the building was still being waged, British graffiti icon Banksy showed his support in a final message to New York at the tail end of his recent high profile stay in the city.

‘Save 5Pointz,’ he wrote.

Unfortunately for graffiti lovers, that message went unheeded by those who wield the wrecking balls.

The end of the 5Pointz era will take an agonizing three or four months as the building that once hosted a thousand artists a year is slowly demolished.

Wolkoff says there will be a 60-foot wall near the proposed towers in where graffiti artists may continue to paint.

Mourning: Graffiti lovers gathered Tuesday to mourn the loss of their New York City Mecca and to plan a vigil

Some people left handwritten notes atop the whitewash paint on Tuesday. Heartbreaking. This is not just about graffiti ¿ it¿s about the unity of people who met here from all over the world. That¿s what really hurts¿ said one mourner

Consolation prize: Over the next several months, 5 Pointz will be torn down and luxury condo towers will be put in its place. The owner says a 60 foot wall will be put in place on which street artists may continue to paint

End of an era: A street artist known as Guess1 works on a memorial mural on Tuesday
