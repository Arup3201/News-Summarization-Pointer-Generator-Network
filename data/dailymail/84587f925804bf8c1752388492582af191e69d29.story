A teenage girl has been left severely disfigured after two older girls allegedly slashed her with knives reportedly because they were jealous that she was so attractive.

Julia Alvarez, 15, was walking to her home in Argentina when she was approached by the two sisters who started kicking her and punched her to the ground.

The attackers - named locally as Flor, 18, and Maira, 16 - then repeatedly slashed her face and body, leaving her covered in blood. She was later found by passersby who called an ambulance.

According to the victim's statement, the pair told her: 'Everyone says you are pretty. You won't look pretty when we have finished with you. People will call you Chucky.'

Chucky is a heavily-scarred doll from the Child's Play horror series which is inhabited by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray.

One cut on the young girl's back alone required 20 stitches and she had needed dozens more on her face to put the flaps of skin back together.

Police in the town of Juan Domingo Peron, in the northern Argentinian province of Formosa, reportedly refused to get involved initially until the teenage girl's sister, Yeni, posted images of her injuries online.

The pictures quickly went viral and caused a mass protest over the police's alleged failure to act.

Yeni said: 'They were jealous of my sister for a long time and always abusing her and insulting her, but we never expected them to go this far.

'I can only assume they were drinking or taking drugs as usual.

'I have tried to stay strong for my beautiful sister but every time I see her I want to burst into tears.

'They have ruined her life. She says she wants to kill herself because when she looks in the mirror she is so ugly now. It has ruined our family.'

Police confirmed that they had interviewed both suspects and had released the 16-year-old because she was too young, but that the 18-year-old they said was still in custody.

The older of the two reportedly claimed that they had been insulted by the 15-year-old and had decided to exact revenge.

Locals in the area have meanwhile threatened vigilante justice against the two attackers.

They say that the two had been accused of regularly taking drugs and terrorising the region for too long, and have received online threats to give them the same treatment they had given the 15-year-old.
