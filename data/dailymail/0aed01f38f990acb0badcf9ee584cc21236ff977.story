If these pictures prove one thing it's that the Huntington-Whiteley clan are one genetically blessed family. 

For Rosie's younger brother Toby has landed his first ever modelling gig - displaying his enviable abs in a pair of summer trunks.

Despite the icy weather Toby showed he's unafraid to get his kit off, to pose semi-naked in a pair of floral board shorts.

The personal trainer's muscular frame, coupled with the Huntington-Whiteley good looks, helped him showcase men's fashion chain Jacamo's Spring Summer collection.

Martin Roberts, head of buying for Jacamo, said: 'Jacamo is about offering men of all shapes and sizes a choice of fashion that fits, regardless of size.

'Standing at a broad 6ft 4ins  tall, Toby was the perfect fit to launch our SS15 product.'

This is Toby's first proper modelling gig although if his test shots are anything to go by then he's going to have no trouble picking up more work.

Toby has previously posted pictures of himself working out on his Instagram account and has learned the Bodyism method of training.

And although he is new to the business, from the looks of it if Toby - who shares his sister's characteristically full lips - carries on the way he started off he'll be well on his way to success.
