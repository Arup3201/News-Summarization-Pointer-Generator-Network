The Clippers may have suffered a defeat last night but at least one young fan will feel like a winner today thanks to coach Los Angeles Doc Rivers. 

Rivers, 54, found a a young LA fan in the crowd during the middle of his team's game in Cleveland against LeBron James and the Cavaliers and offered his apologies for how the Clippers were playing.

The final score was 105-94, but that margin makes the game seem closer than it was.

The best apology that Doc Rivers (right) could offer a young LA Clippers fan was a kind word and a fist-bump 

The Los Angeles coach was so upset with his team's play that he felt the need to offer an apology 

Despite the apology from Rivers, the young LA fan was left mystified by the 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers 

Things were so bad for the Clippers, a franchise that has had its share of embarrassing moments over the years, that Rivers found a young fan who was sitting courtside and apologized to him. 

After exchanging some small talk, Rivers and the boy fist-bumped. 

The coach, who won a championship while leading the Boston Celtics, added: 'We should have given you a better game today.

'We'll make it up to you, alright? Give me some.'

The second-place Clippers found themselves trailing by double digits for much of the game and there was also a three-minute span in the first half where the team was hit with four technical fouls.

The Clippers (33-17) have now lost three of their last four. 

Thanks in large part to the play of superstar James, the Cavaliers (31-20) have won 12 in a row.

Following the loss, Rivers said: 'We clearly were not ready for Cleveland's intensity,

'They came out and attacked us and hit us in the mouth, and we didn't respond. 

'I thought basically the entire game they were the first-strike team and we were the retaliators.' 

Even though his team lost by double digits last night, this Clippers fan left the game feeling like a winner 

Rivers was not apologetic while coaching the Boston Celtics and receiving grief from LA Lakers fan Jack Nicholson. Rivers won one championship while he was coaching the Celtics 

The Cleveland Cavaliers (31-20) have won 12 in row thanks to the play of their leader, LeBron James 

The Clippers played so poorly that Rivers pulled his starters before the fourth quarter even started. 

He said: 'I should've pulled them at halftime.

'Honestly, I really should've. That was on me. 

'I thought about it, because I didn't think we had great energy tonight. I probably should've.

'They kicked our butt.'
