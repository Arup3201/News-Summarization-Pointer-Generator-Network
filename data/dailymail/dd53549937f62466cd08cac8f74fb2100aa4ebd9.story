England's cricketers may have slumped to a one-day international series defeat in Sri Lanka, but the team spirit seems to remain undamaged.

That's judging by a tweet from batsman Ravi Bopara, who gave his team-mates the chance to play a prank on him when he forgot to lock his hotel room door.

His fellow England players wasted no time in making Bopara regret the error of his ways by dumping the entire contents of his room on top of his bed.

Ravi Bopara tweeted the above image of his hotel room after accidentally leaving the door unlocked

But Bopara, who saw the funny side of the joke, seems to know who the pranksters are.

Alongside the image of his ruined room, the Essex batsman wrote the caption 'I guess I deserve it for not locking my room door. #WhosDoneThis? @alexhales1 @finnysteve @joeroot05 @josbuttler'.

England are 4-2 down in the one day series against Sri Lanka with the final match set to take place in Colombo on Tuesday. 

Bopara should be in the side as the tourists look to sign off with a win. 

Bopara believes Joe Root is one of the culprits who trashed his room after leaving it unlocked
