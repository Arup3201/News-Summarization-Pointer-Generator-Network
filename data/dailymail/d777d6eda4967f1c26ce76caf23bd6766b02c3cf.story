A report released by a German investigative group insists it was a Russian missile launcher that shot down flight MH17 in July killing all 298 passengers.

Searching For The Truth, a documentary produced by CORRECT!V, offers fresh testimonies from military experts, separatist fighters and residents of East Ukraine. 

They have also collected photo, video and satellite evidence to produce a compelling account of how events unfolded on July 17 last year.

Their findings come just one day after pictures emerged of the Ukrainian air force pilot accused by pro-Russian rebels of being the man who shot the plane down.

Fresh claim: A report released by a German investigative group insists a Buk surface to air missile launcher (model pictured) operated by the 53rd Russian Air Defense Brigade shot down flight MH17

The German investigative group claims the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane was shot down by a Buk surface to air missile launcher operated by the 53rd Russian Air Defense Brigade, Kyiv Post reports.

They say the the armed vehicle entered Ukraine to protect Russian armor that had been vulnerable to aerial attack earlier in the conflict - which erupted in April when Kremlin-backed militants seized several government buildings in the Donbas.

Speaking to CORRECT!V, military experts claimed only specially-trained troops acting as a tight and well-drilled unit could have operated the Buk.

They would have had just seconds, from when they sighted the plane, to switch on their radar and accurately fire the rocket.

Tragic: The crash killed all the 298 people on board the Boeing, which was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur

Reporters working for the German investigative group travelled to the town of Snizhne in east Ukraine, held by Kremlin-backed separatists.  

Several people they spoke to in the town described sights and sounds consistent with the launch of a Buk missile on the day flight MH17 crashed. 

One witness went further, claiming he had seen the vehicle and then the missile shooting into the sky afterwards.

They said: 'They shot it down. The missile flew from here. We saw it, as it flew. I was in the yard and heard an explosion, a bang. It was a really loud bang. The tiles on my roof shook. 

'Then there was a long sound. And then a very loud explosion: bang, bang. And just as I ran out into the road, the plane began to fall. Down the road, several kilometers from here. And you could see it burn.'

CORRECT!V also interviewed a former SBU officer turned separatist commander, Aleksandr Khodakovskiy, who initially told Reuters his fighters were in possession of a Buk, before retracting his statement.

Khodakovskiy says a Buk from Russia was sent back after the MH17 disaster, but his forces are still supported by one Buk unit. 

He suggested neither are operated by his militia, claiming they did not have the specialists for such high precision weapons systems.

However in August, footage shot by a clandestine Ukrainian police team showed an image of a BUK weapons system on a Volvo truck being smuggled out of eastern Ukraine in the early hours of July 18, the day after the plane crash. 

Searching for the Truth also trashes rival claims by Russian authorities that a Ukrainian jet downed MH17. 

The report claims that the type of damage that existed on the wreckage could only have been caused by a surface to air missile.

Rival claim: Pro-Russian rebels have accused Ukrainian pilot Captain Vladislav Voloshin (above) of being the 'executioner' of the 298 victims on board doomed Malaysian Airlines flight MH17

Volshin has not spoken directly on the loss of MH17 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible. Ukraine blames Russia for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him 

They also conclude that a jet firing on the front of the passenger plane would have to have been travelling from Russian airspace - which MH17 was just 40 kilometers away from entering.

Despite these apparent facts, the Russian Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - believe a Ukrainian pilot is responsible for the tragedy.

They are calling for Captain Vladislav Voloshin to take a lie-detector test and face formal questioning, asserting there is compelling evidence against him which should be considered by the Dutch-led official probe.

Believed to be in his late 20s, he was named by stems from a 'secret witness' at his Dnipropetrovsk air base who says the pilot took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles.

The report from CORRECT!V suggest the Russian Investigative Committee's are completely untrue.

Aside from new witness testimonies, much of the report's findings are taken from information already in the public domain - including evidence from reputable open source investigators Bellingcat.

Bellingcat has spent months gathering and verifying evidence related to Russian troop movements in Ukraine.

They geolocated photos of a Buk missile launcher on its journey from Snizhne to Russia immediately after the MH17 was downed.

From this they were able to identify the armed vehicle as belonging to Russia's 53rd Air Defense Brigade, based in Kursk.

Investigators did so by matching a partially obscured identification number and the unique scratches and dents shown in the Snizhne photos with pictures and footage taken in June of a convoy of Russian armour as it drives towards the Ukrainian border from Kursk.

Searching for the Truth also trashes rival claims by Russian authorities that a Ukrainian jet downed MH17 

Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, said: 'At this point it's undeniable the Russian military provided the Buk It seems that the one key piece of information is autopsy data from the Dutch criminal investigation. 

'They've confirmed pieces of metal were found in the bodies, and if they come from a Buk warhead then I don't think there will be any question about who was responsible for shooting down MH17.'

The Russian Investigative Committee says Ukrainian pilot Captain Vladislav Voloshin took off in his Su-17 combat jet on 17 July last year armed with air-to-air missiles but landed without them - proving their theory he is responsible for the crime.

Voloshin has not spoken directly on the loss of MH17 but denied through his superiors that he was responsible. Ukraine blames Russia for a crude propaganda stunt in naming him.
