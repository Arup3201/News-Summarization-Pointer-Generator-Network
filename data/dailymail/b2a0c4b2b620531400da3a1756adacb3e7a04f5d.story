A family have claimed they were gassed and robbed after parking their motorhome in a French service area – the latest in a spate of attacks on British tourists.

Nick Turner, 51, his wife Joy, 52, and their children Lizzie, 20, and 14-year-old Robert were asleep in their £65,000 Swift Kon-tiki motorhome when the thieves struck in the early hours.

The family only realised the break-in had occurred when they woke the next morning with sore throats and headaches – and found that about £2,000 of valuables were missing.

Last night, Mr Turner, a solicitor from Malvern, Worcestershire, called on the French government to act before a tourist is killed. Other British families have reported similar raids this summer, leading to the Caravan Club to issue a warning last month telling holidaymakers not to stop in French motorway service areas.

However, experts in Britain have cast doubt over the use of gas by gangs of thieves.

The Turners were travelling to Switzerland two weeks ago when they decided to spend the night in a well-lit rest area on the A4 motorway near Metz, a garrison town in the Lorraine region.

Mr Turner said: ‘We believe the thieves pumped laughing gas in through the vents to knock us out. They then ransacked our motorhome with us inside.

‘Nobody heard them breaking in through the main door and we were out that cold that they then broke out through another door. It is still amazing to think none of us stirred or heard a sound.

The Turner family, who had stopped off near Metz in north eastern France, only realised the break-in had occurred when they woke the next morning with sore throats and headaches – and found that about £2,000 of valuables were missing

‘All in all, about £2,000 worth of goods and cash was taken. We even had a toothbrush stolen along with an iPad and my son’s Sony PlayStation.

‘But the worst part is the intrusion and not knowing what happened. None of us had any idea it was happening and that is very frightening indeed.’

He added: ‘It was shocking to be the victim of such a crime and it can only be a matter of time before a small child is killed by these thieves as we all know gas kills.’

He also called for the French government to crack down on the crime. ‘They treated it as a very mundane crime, but having people in your motorhome gassing you should be treated much more seriously. It is only a matter of time before someone is killed either by the fumes or waking up midway through a robbery.

‘When you have tourists gassed in their sleep, it’s not a very good advert for your country.’

A gendarme at the police station in Metz said: ‘This happens all the time. It is mainly to foreign tourists or lorry drivers. We send out patrol cars – what else can we do?

‘What do the British police do? It must be happening in Britain. We suspect it’s people from Eastern Europe.’

The attack comes just weeks after the Chadwick family, from Oakwood, Derby, also had £2,000 of valuables stolen in a similar raid.

Jamie Chadwick, 21, and his girlfriend Janie Horsley, 17, were travelling back from Spain with his mother Linda, father Darren and two relatives when they decided to spend the night at a service station near Bourges on the A71.

Mrs Chadwick said at the time: ‘We all woke up at around 6am, with headaches and really sore throats. We then realised we had been robbed. We were all in shock – it was so awful.’

Last night, the Royal College of Anaesthetists said: ‘It would not be possible to knock someone unconscious by blowing gas through the window of a motorhome without their knowledge, even if they were sleeping.’

A report issued by the Foreign Office last week said: ‘Avoid parking in isolated areas of unsupervised camping grounds, and consider installing an alarm in your caravan or mobile home.’
