Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage a fresh strike in their bitter row with the Government over pensions.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union will walk out for five hours on the night of October 19 in opposition to plans to force them to work longer.

They argue firefighters cannot be expected to continue answering 999 calls 'in their late 50s and into their 60s' but ministers said the latest industrial action was 'unconstructive and unnecessary'.

Strike: Firefighters will walk out for five hours next weekend in protest at changes to their pensions

The FBU said members will walk out for five hours from from 6.30pm on Saturday October 19.

It follows a similar stoppage last month as the stand-off with the government escalates.

Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: ‘We had hoped our first strike was enough to show Government that firefighters could not be more serious about protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions.

‘No firefighter wants to strike, and it's desperately disappointing that governments in Westminster and Cardiff continue to deny reality over pensions costs and the need for a pension scheme that reflects the job firefighters do.

Age: FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said firefighters cannot be expected to fight fires in their 50s and 60s

‘Firefighters simply cannot be expected to fight fires and rescue families in their late 50s and into their 60s.

‘We hope this second strike will mean both governments will be willing to discuss the full range of concerns that firefighters and the general public have expressed.

‘However, more strikes cannot be ruled out if that's what it takes to protect public and firefighter safety from these ludicrous attacks.’

Firefighters in Scotland will not be taking industrial action following an offer on pensions from the Scottish Government which the union said was enough to prevent a strike ‘at the current time’.

The FBU argues that changes to pensions and the retirement age will see thousands of firefighters lose their job ‘simply for getting older’.

The union also maintains that firemen and women pay some of the highest pension contributions in the UK at almost 13 per cent of their salary, with further rises due next year.

But the government accused the FBU of a rush to strike action instead of seeking a resolution to the dispute.

Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said the decision to announce another strike date is 'totally unconstructive and unnecessary'.

He added: 'The FBU themselves have said that this dispute can only be resolved through dialogue, discussion and negotiation.

'The firefighters' pension scheme is one of the most generous pension schemes in the public sector.'

A firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60, will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension, the government says.

An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.

Mr Lewis added: 'The firefighter pension age of 60 was introduced in 2006 and matches the police and armed forces.

'Any early ill-health retirements will see an unreduced pension. Firefighter fitness is decided by local fire and rescue authorities so the union needs to work with them to resolve that issue.

'We have informed the FBU that we will support that process with the conciliation service Acas as required.'

Row: The latest walkout against government cuts 'is totally unconstructive and unnecessary', the government said

Fire chiefs moved to reassure the public that safety would not be put at risk.

London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: ‘We are as prepared as ever to deal with this next round of strike action. It's a shame that further action is being taken, but our contingency plan will kick in and we will be ready to deal with emergencies.

‘There will be 27 fire engines based at strategic points across London, ready to provide an emergency back-up fire service. They won't deal with minor incidents like bin fires or automatic fire alarms, but will attend serious emergencies like large fires and road traffic accidents.

‘Once again, our advice is to take extra care to prevent fires at home. Simple steps like ensuring your hob is switched off and cigarettes are properly extinguished can make all the difference.’
