She did the early morning makeover countless times on the Today show. But Katie Couric was clearly excited this morning as she prepared to make her debut on Good Morning America.

The television presenter, 55, who is a guest anchor on the ABC show this week while Robin Roberts is on vacation, tweeted an Instagram photo of herself during her journey into the studio at around 6am.

With her face bare of make-up and her hair still damp from the shower, she was barely recognisable from the glossy, groomed figure we are more familiar with.

Unrecognisable: Katie Couric tweeted an Instagram photo of herself from her car en route to the GMA studios this morning. Clearly bleary-eyed from the early start, she was wearing sunglasses - despite the still-dark sky

Evidently a little bleary-eyed from the early-morning wake-up call, she told her Twitter followers: 'Not used to waking up this early anymore! Where's the coffee?!'

Ms Couric was even sporting sunglasses - despite the fact that it was still dark outside.

Referencing the popular song by Corey Hart, she accompanied the picture with the words: 'I wear sunglasses at night (and early in the am)'

Excited: She was looking rather more like herself by 7.30am when she tweeted her second photo, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of a make-up artist giving a final dusting of face powder before the show went live

This didn't seem to hamper her mood. From the wide grin in the photo to her commentary on the pre-show prep, Ms Couric's enthusiasm was infectious.

'Prepping with producers...loving the @GMA energy! Busy morning!' she wrote.

'Final touches!' she tweeted.

Polished: Ms Couric on air with co-host George Stephanopoulos. She is covering this week for Robin Roberts

According to TMZ, not everybody at GMA was pleased about Ms Couric's guest role. The website has claimed that Ms Roberts, who is well-liked among her colleagues, was 'unhappy' about the casting.

It was called a 'slap in the face' and one source said: 'They should have put Katie on when George was on vacation.'

Ms Couric was last seen on breakfast television almost six years ago on NBC's Today show. She had been a co-anchor on the show for 15 years.

She had said goodbye to the show to become the first female anchor for CBS Evening News. She is now a special correspondent for ABC news, contributing to a number of their programs.

She is set to launch Katie, her own Disney-ABC daytime talk show, on September 10.

Delighted: Despite the fact her last breakfast television appearance was almost six years ago, the presenter drew a crowd of early morning fans all keen to witness her return

Despite the early start, Ms Couric managed to bring her sense of humour to the set as she co-hosted with George Stephanopoulos.

She featured in a comical prerecorded video when the show started, pretending to run around in her pajamas as she prepared for the day.

Let the banter begin: Matt Lauer launched a jibe at Sarah Palin in a phone interview to promote her stint as co-anchor tomorrow

Today's GMA show featured several segments about the unidentified Mega Millions lottery winners as well coverage of the Pakistani beauty queen who has been charged with an alleged mortgage scam.

In a strategic counter-programming move, the Today show tomorrow will be co-hosted by Sarah Palin.

Offering a taster of the banter viewers can expect when she joins the NBC morning show, Matt Lauer interviewed Mrs Palin live via telephone today.

He asked: 'What are you doing to prepare? Are you reading some newspapers?'

The acerbic question was of course a play on the one posed by Katie Couric during a CBS interview that Mrs Palin, then a GOP VP candidate, was unable to answer.

Again, she failed to answer directly with a list of publications, instead responding with: 'Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho... Great! That’s a fine how do you do? That’s a great start. Here we go.'

When asked how she was feeling ahead of her stint as co-anchor, Mrs Palin replied: 'How nervous you should all be, perhaps.'

She also praised the network's 'boldness' in allowing her to host the show, adding: 'I really look forward to this and you know I appreciate NBC’s boldness in having me on.'
