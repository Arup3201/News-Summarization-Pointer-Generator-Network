Britain will veto plans by Albania to join the European Union unless new rules are introduced to immigration.

Brussels today named Albania as a candidate to join after changes were made to the way the country of 3million people is run.

But David Cameron has made clear that he will block any attempt to allow Albania to formally join the 28-nation bloc without new limits on freedom of movement.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama welcomed the news that Albania had cleared the first hurdle on its long path to European Union membership, on his country's fourth try

EU leaders meeting on Friday will formally sign off the decision to allow Albania to start the process of preparing its application to join. Albania has failed to win the coveted status three times since 2009.

Countries including Britain and Germany have made clear it will not be allowed to proceed without further efforts to tackle corruption and the introduction of an independent judiciary.

However, Downing Street today made clear that the it will use its veto to block further expansion of the EU without new rules to prevent migrants from new, poorer countries moving to the UK in search of work.

A Number 10 source said: ‘It is absolutely clear that before Albania can ever join, the long-term transitional arrangements would have to apply. If they don’t, we won’t let them in. End of story.’

Mr Cameron is pushing the idea of new countries having to reach a set level of income per head before the borders are opened to the rest of the EU.

It follows concerns about the influx of people from countries like Poland, and more recently Bulgaria and Romania, when they joined the EU.

Albania has been granted candidate status in the process of applying to join the 28-nation bloc, but will have to overcome opposition in Westminster to be successful

The prospect of EU expansion has emerged for the first time since the European Parliament elections, in which support surged for Eurosceptic parties.

In Britain, UKIP topped the poll, beating Labour into second place and the Tories third.

Mr Cameron believes the introduction of controls on freedom of movement for new controls could be a major gain in his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister set out that all and any future accessions would have to be the subject of the new transitional controls that he wants to see, and that would apply to all and any future cases.

‘This is not a decision on accession, it’s a decision to at some point in the future, it could be several years down the line, this is the beginning of any negotiations.

‘There is a period of negotiations that in some countries’ cases has taken decades, any final decision, at the end of that process requires unanimity, and the Prime Minister is very clear the new transitional requirements he wants to see would have to apply to any and all future accessions.’

Albania will not be allowed to progress in joining the EU without major reforms on the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking.

As well as Britain, other countries taking a hardline stance include Holland, Germany, France, the Czech Republic and Spain.

In a statement, the EU said Albania had to address issues such as the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said that, with the EU's decision, Albania had 'regained its lost dignity in the eyes of international partners.'

'It was not an easy job, Europe is not a door that opens easily. After the (European) elections, things could have gone in another direction. The reason I am thankful to European leaders ... is that they stood by the project of Europe,' he told reporters in the Albanian capital Tirana.
