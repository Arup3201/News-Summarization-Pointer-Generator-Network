A 100-year-old widower killed himself after he could no longer surf the internet because he was going blind, an inquest has heard.

Gordon Crisp's relatives bought him a laptop when he was struggling to cope with his wife's death in 2007.

He enjoyed watching online videos of opera and jazz performance - but after he developed macular degeneration, it became increasingly difficult for him to use the computer.

On December 29, Mr Crisp was found dead by his son-in-law on the floor of his bedroom at his home in Keynsham, Somerset.

Dr Peter Harrowing, assistant deputy coroner for Avon, said: 'They bought him a laptop computer and aged 95 he was taught how to surf the internet.

'He spent many hours surfing the net finding clips of opera and jazz.

'He developed macular degeneration affecting his eyesight which meant he could no longer use the computer which had given him so much enjoyment.'

Son-in-law Cameron Hughes told the inquest in Flax Bourton, Somerset: 'Gordon was a proud man who struggled to allow people to do the day-to-day tasks.

'I had no idea he wanted to take his life but I was aware he was struggling with day-to-day life.

'I saw the milk on the doorstep and the post in the holder, and I was instantly alarmed.

'I pushed the bedroom door and it was heavy to move, and I was shocked to see Gordon behind the door. I was sure he had passed away.'

A report from his doctor confirmed that the retired engineer had glaucoma and impaired vision and suffered from 'bereavement issues' when his wife died.

Mr Crisp's daughter Kathleen Llewellyn told the inquest: 'He was a very independent man and never wanted to be a burden to anyone.

'I know when his sight failed it was a concern for him, he always wanted to stay in his own home and didn't want a carer.'

'He probably decided he didn't wish to be a burden and felt this was an appropriate way out. '

Dr Harrowing returned a verdict of suicide, saying: 'Mr Crisp took deliberate steps at a time when he was unlikely to be disturbed and knew when taking the action his death would ensue.

'We will never know why he took the actions he did but we have heard he obviously missed his wife of many years.

'He probably decided he didn't wish to be a burden and felt this was an appropriate way out. Sadly elderly people do take this action from time to time.

'Having heard the evidence I record he took his own life.'
