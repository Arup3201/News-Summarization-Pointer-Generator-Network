Remember all those healthy New Year resolutions about going to the gym, walking to the shops and always taking the stairs at work?

Well, if you still have pangs of guilt at how your best intentions failed to last the distance, here is some good news.

The health effects of missing out on daily exercise and sitting around in the office all week can be cancelled out by just one workout a week.

A new study has found those who managed two and a half hours of exercise on one or two days of the week were just as healthy as others doing the same amount stretched over a longer period

The one snag is that the weekly 
exercise session – such as a brisk walk or bike ride – has to be an 
exhausting two and a half hours long.

Researchers found those who managed 
150 minutes of exercise on one or two days of the week were just as 
healthy as others doing the same amount over a longer period.

Dr Ian Janssen, who led the research,
 said: ‘The findings indicate it does not matter how adults choose to 
accumulate their 150 weekly minutes of physical activity.’

The Canadian study claims it does not matter how people accumulate their recommended weekly 150 minutes of exercise

Guidelines usually recommend adults 
perform moderate to vigorous physical activity on most or all days of 
the week for a total of 150 minutes, with no advice for frequency.

So Dr Janssen and colleagues at 
Queen’s University, Toronto, attached a motion detector to the waists of
 2,324 men and woman aged between 18 and 64.

The tiny electrical actical 
accelerometer, about the size of a small package of matches, records how
 much a person moves every minute.

The adults who met the advice of more
 than 150 minutes a week of aerobic activity were divided into those who
 exercised on five to seven or one to four of the days.

Physical exams and blood tests on the
 participants then measured their ‘metabolic syndrome’ which indicates 
risk factors for diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

Those who were ‘infrequently active’ 
were in no greater danger of developing these illesses than their 
‘frequently active’ counterparts, according to the study published in 
the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism.

Dr Janssen said: ‘For instance, 
someone who did not perform any physical activity on Monday to Friday 
but was active for 150 minutes over the weekend would obtain the same 
health benefits from their activity as someone who accumulated 150 
minutes of activity over the week by doing 20-25 minutes of activity on a
 daily basis.

‘The important message is adults should aim to accumulate at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity.’
