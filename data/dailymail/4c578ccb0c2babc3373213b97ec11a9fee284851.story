Andrea Pirlo's last-gasp goal earned 10-man Juventus a dramatic win over Torino in the Turin derby on Sunday evening.

The veteran midfielder struck at the death from 25 yards to break the visitors' hearts, following a heroic effort from Giampiero Ventura's side. 

The hosts took the lead early on with Arturo Vidal cooly converting from the penalty spot, before Bruno Peres' stunning long-range effort - their first goal in the Turin derby in 12 years and nine months - just seven minutes after looked to have earned Torino a valuable point.

But late drama from Pirlo means Juve have now extended their lead at the top to six points ahead of second-placed Roma's clash with Inter Milan on Sunday evening.

Massimiliano Allegri's men started the game by far the brighter and were unlucky not to be ahead inside the opening six minutes as Patrice Evra found Fernando Llorente in the box, with the latter's header ending up just inches over the crossbar.

The breakthrough did come soon after though as Juventus took a giant step towards taking maximum points from the month of November.

Referee Daniele Orsato had already warned all the players to keep their arms down and when the ball struck Torino's Omar El Kaddouri's arm in the 15th minute, the Italian had no hesitation in pointing to the spot.

Vidal - who missed from the spot against Olympiakos in the Champions League earlier this month - converted from 12 yards, but had to retake it because of encroachment, with the Chile international this time slotting the ball into the opposite corner.

The incredible goalscoring drought Torino have had against Juventus was clearly something they were keen to address though, doing so in spectacular fashion just seven minutes later as they got back on level terms.

Peres picked up the ball on the edge of his own area before racing all the way up the other end and unleashing a unstoppable effort which went in off the inside of the far post.

Both sides had chances to score as the game drew on, with Vidal having the ball in the back of the net for the third time of the evening, but it was correctly ruled out for offside.

However, Juventus did go on to snatch the win with practically the last kick of the game, with Pirlo's long-range screamer finding the  bottom left corner to settle an enthralling contest.
