Heads often turn when Gladys and the girls arrive at the pub.

But it is not their laughter, glamorous outfits and full-on make-up that alerts patrons to the entrance of Gladys, Linda, Kira, Carla, Liz and Tanya.

It is the fact that all of them have been – or still are – men who prefer to be women.

Girls just want to have fun: Kira, Linda, Gladys, Carla and Liz never fail to turn heads during their nights out

In an often intolerant world, the Buchlyvie Inn has become their haven.

Antiques dealer Gladys Paterson, 76, who used to be Jim Robertson, is the ‘leader of the pack’.

She and her friends visit the pub in the Stirlingshire village once a month.

In 2004, Jim shocked his neighbours in Buchlyvie (population 586) when he went on holiday – and came back as Gladys, after becoming the oldest Briton to have sex change surgery.

Her friends are all at various stages on the transgender trail.

Linda Kelly, 48, was born John Kelly in Possilpark, Glasgow.

Kira, 47, is an engineer from Lanarkshire.

She underwent surgery seven years ago, but prefers not to reveal her male identity.

Postie Carla Sandilands, 40, grew up in Renfrewshire as Craig and became Carla in 2008.

Retired schoolteacher Liz Brown, 65, still ‘lives in the closet’ and will not give her male name.

She revealed she has health issues which preclude her from physically becoming a woman.

But she added: ‘In my head and in my heart, I am a female.’

Tanya is the only member of the group who does not want to share any of her past. She said: ‘I’m a private person, but I am a woman and I’m happy.’

Gladys’ story is typical of all her friends, who find comfort in each other’s company.

She said: ‘For years I wanted to shed the trappings of being a man – get rid of male clothes and everything else that reminded me that for more than 60 years I hadn’t been able to live as I wanted.’

When Jim Robertson was widowed, he spent a year on hormone therapy treatment and then had the operation.

Gladys said: ‘If this opportunity had been denied me, I would have ended up in a psychiatric hospital.

'To me, the procedure was as vital as the heart surgery which had earlier saved my life.

‘Gladys is who I wanted to be since I was seven years old. I just didn’t think it would take 62 years. I’ve finally been able to live the life I believe I was supposed to lead – and I’ve never been happier.’

It is the reason why Gladys likes to support her friends, as she knows what they are going through.

She added: ‘I try to be around for them when they’re having a hard time. We support each other.’

The nights out in the pub are very much part of that support. Gladys said: ‘The community and the pub is a hub of friendship.’

Buchlyvie Inn landlady Sandra Podesta said: ‘The girls are good customers and everyone is happy to see them.

‘I have known Gladys since she was Jim. She and her friends will always be welcomed by my staff and customers.’
