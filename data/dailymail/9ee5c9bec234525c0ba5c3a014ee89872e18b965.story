Pervert: Gavin Clark, 41, was jailed for 12 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years for three charges of possessing indecent images of children

A primary school caretaker who had 1,749 pornographic pictures of children on his computer had been secretly living in a store cupboard at the school for weeks.

Gavin Clark, 41, was jailed for 12 months and put on the sex offenders' register for 10 years yesterday after he admitted three charges of possessing indecent images of children.

Clark, of no fixed address, had been staying in a cupboard at Eaton Primary School, Norwich, - which has around 360 children - after his marriage collapsed.

His computer equipment, along with other personal items including a bed, was discovered in the cupboard after he had gone off work sick.

Police found the indecent images on his computer after being alerted by worried staff.

Kevin Eastwick, prosecuting, said the pictures were found on Clark's laptop along with a memory stick and memory card.

Mr Eastwick told Norwich Crown Court that 491 images were in the two most serious categories and many showed children under 13.

Clark told police he had found them on a memory card he came across near the school and had transferred the images by mistake onto his laptop.

Ian James, defending, said: 'There was no previous indication of a propensity towards this sort of behaviour.'

Mr James said Clark, who has been sacked, moved out of his home after his marriage broke down and went to live at his school.

He said: 'He was effectively living for some time in a cupboard in a school where he worked at the time.

'That fact explains the presence of the material in that particular location.'

Mr James added: 'This has been an extremely salutary lesson for him. He feels very concerned about the way he will be seen by right-minded members of the public.

'He has mentioned to me how sad it is that by behaving in this way he had deprived himself of the work he enjoyed very much. He will no longer be able to work in the sort of environment that he had worked in previously.

'This was a product of the circumstances of a break-up in his personal life. He is unlikely to behave in this way again.'

Pupils: Eaton Primary School, Norwich, where Gavin Clark lived in a cupboard and worked as a caretaker

Jailing him, Judge Mark Lucraft said he accepted that Clark had not made or distributed any indecent images.

The judge told Clark: 'It seems the reasons for your behaviour are very difficult to discern.'

In a statement issued by Norfolk County Council following the case, Steve Portas, headteacher at Eaton Primary School, said: 'Safeguarding children is always our first priority.

'To hear that a former member of our staff has acted in this way is deeply upsetting and we are pleased that Clark has been brought to justice.

'Our school takes the safety and welfare of its pupils extremely seriously and deals with any allegations quickly and robustly.

'We acted as soon as these allegations came to light by referring the matter to the police and Norfolk County Council and have assisted them fully with their investigations.'

'Abusing his position of trust, he has stored this material within an environment where young children were present.

'His calculating approach to the crime using the cupboard demonstrates how he thought he could evade the police and prosecution.'

- Det Con Pippa Hinds, of Norfolk Police

Mr Portas added: 'Clark, who had undergone all the appropriate checks before he took up his post, was suspended as soon as these allegations came to light.

'He no longer works at the school.

'Our school community works very hard and wants to do well.

'We can now move on from what has been an extremely difficult time for everybody.'

Speaking after Clark was jailed, Detective Constable Pippa Hinds, who led the investigation, said he had 'abused the position of trust he had been given by using the premises'.

DC Hinds, of Norfolk Police, said: 'The fact that he used a store cupboard at the school to store his offensive material aggravates this offence further.

'Abusing his position of trust, he has stored this material within an environment where young children were present.

'His calculating approach to the crime using the cupboard demonstrates how he thought he could evade the police and prosecution.

'His sentencing should underline to others who are considering similar actions that the Constabulary will deal with any such offences pro-actively and robustly.'
