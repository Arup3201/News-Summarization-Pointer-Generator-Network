Quack (pictured) rewards users for watching video adverts as they chat to friends. Money is paid on a monthly basis

There are dozens of apps that promise to be rivals to Whatsapp, but the latest finally has a unique selling point that might encourage people to make the switch.

Quack! is an instant messaging service that shares advertising revenue with its users.

It rewards people by watching adverts at the top of their screen as they chat to friends and family, and payments are made on a monthly basis.

The app is already available in Spain and Italy, and has now officially launched in the UK.

Each time a user begins chatting to friends on the app, tailored advertising appears at the top.

This includes pictures and videos.

The adverts play in a pop-out box meaning the app can still be used as normal, and payments are only made for ads that are watched in full. 

The
 amount of money for each advert varies, depending on the amount the 
advertiser has paid, and the length of the advert.

Although £20 is the maximum monthly amount that can be earned, a typical month's revenue is likely to be around £1 - unless you're a power user. This is €20, and around €1 in Spain and Italy.

Using the app also depends on friends and family using it too.

Quack! is available for free on Android and iPhone and, like Whatsapp, lets users share images and videos.

‘We identified that mobile users often enjoy watching high quality and non-intrusive adverts, particularly during 'dead’ time,' said Fernando Troyano, founder and CEO of Quack! Messenger.

‘Consumers also feel they deserve to earn a share of the profits made by advertising to them.

‘Just by chatting on Quack! Messenger people can earn additional money by doing something they already do every day.’

At the end of each calendar month, users are given the option to collect or accumulate the money raised. Payment is made via PayPal.

The app also lets users donate revenue earned from chatting to a number of registered charities.
