MSNBC's latest high-profile hire Ronan Farrow came on the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon Wednesday night to talk about his new show and his extraordinary childhood spent with a dozen siblings.

The 26-year-old son of actress Mia Farrow and (possibly) Woody Allen said that he grew up in a home with 12 brothers and sisters, many of them adopted from all around the world and some of them suffering from various disabilities.

'I had siblings from South Asia, from East Asia, from depressed communities around America, and you know, we'd have long conversations,' Farrow recalled.

Unique guest: Ronan Farrow, 26, came on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon to discuss his new MSNBC show and shed light on his extraordinary upbringing

Funnyman: The young TV presenter shared an amusing anecdote from his childhood where he discovered that his blind sister, Frankie, did not know their sibling Quincy was black

The young TV presenter shared an amusing anecdote involving tow of his adopted sisters, one of them African-American and another blind.

'My sister Quincy, who is black, would get called the N-word at school and we'd talk for hours, and my sister Frankie, who's blind, would chime in an hour into  conversation about race, "Wait, Quincy's black?"' Farrow recounted to peals of laughter from the audience.

‘Still haven't told her what color I am.' 

The dashing intellectual briefly talked about enrolling in college at the age of 11 – a time in his life which Farrow jokingly said he did not remember because he was ‘so drunk.’ 

Family from all over: Mia Farrow is seen here with five of her children in 1996, and the smallest girl in the left side of the photo is Frankie, who is blind. The other siblings are identified as Thaddeus (bottom left), Isaiah (holding Farrows other hand), Tam (who died four years after this photo, behind Isaiah) and Elsa

Discussion points: Ronan told how his sister Quincy, seen here with their mother in 2011, was called the n-word at school, and when they discussed it at the dinner table, Frankie only then realized what color Quincy was

When Farrow was 16, he entered Yale Law School, followed by stints as a foreign policy official in the first Obama administration, the United States' first Special Adviser for Global Youth during the Arab Spring revolutions and a US diplomat focused on the conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

‘I’m just following your footsteps,’ Farrow jokingly told Fallon. ‘It was all a plan to become a second fiddle to you.'

The Late Night host mentioned during the 
five-minute interview that his tech-savvy guest, who boasts nearly 
200,000 Twitter followers, enjoys live-tweeting major national events 
like the recent Grammy Awards ceremony and Tuesday night's State of the 
Union Address.

United by family: Mia Farrow is a prolific Twitter user and civil rights activist and after the Trayvon Martin shooting, she posted this photo with the caption: 'These guys like Skittles & occasionally wear hoodies. Do they look "suspicious"? (They're my sons)'

Proud mom: Mia Farrow also shared this picture of two of her grown daughters, captioning it 'sisters'

After sharing a couple of Farrow's amusing tweets comparing singer Ariana Grande's name to a Microsoft font and poking fun at the Grammys for choosing Julia Roberts to present an award, Fallon briefly addressed the elephant in the room: a Vanity Fair article which had suggested that Ronan’s biological father was Frank Sinatra.

'You just killed this one, put it to rest,' Fallon said, reading Farrow's tweet on the subject: ‘Listen, we’re all possibly Frank Sinatra’s son.'

When asked about his still unnamed political show premiering on MSNBC February 24, Farrow jokingly defined his goal as to 'get as many Twitter followers as humanly possible.'

The prolific journalist and one-time 
government official then turned serious, saying that he would like to 
get more people actively involved in the news.

‘It's
 been an honor to serve in government, and I was eager for the 
opportunity to then be on the outside and to be the annoying gadfly 
poking people in the eye,’ he said. 

Farrow
 concluded, ‘My hope is every week we will introduce a call to action 
where we can track how people are actually reacting to the story, being a
 part of it themselves and being a part of the solution.’
