A captivating series of photos appear to show a family of baby brown bears dancing to Ring a Ring o’ Roses as their mother relaxes behind a tree nearby.

At just a few months old, two young males and one female gather in a circle, clutch each others’ hands and looks as if they are dancing to the popular nursery rhyme.

It’s almost like a scene from a school playground as the bears joyfully play together, tapping their feet and moving around in a circle.

However, after a while, one baby bear is left standing alone appearing to do a victory jig while, in another photo, another baby bear is escaping up a tree.

PE teacher Valtteri Mulkahainen, 52, was lucky enough to witness the magical moment and captured it on his camera which he uses as a hobby.

He was travelling through eastern Finland when they came across the bears near Suomussalmi.

Valtteri, from Sotkamo in east Finland, said: 'When I saw them standing on their hind legs I thought I was imagining it.

Childlike: According to Valtteri, the bears were constantly fighting and playing with each other 'just like small children' as he watched nearby

'It seemed like I was in the middle of the magic forest in a fairy tale.

'If the bears began to sing I probably wouldn’t have been surprised because it was so unusual to watch.'

According to Valtteri, the bears were constantly fighting and playing with each other 'just like small children' as he watched nearby.

While the mother bear was eating, her children were constantly fighting while standing on their hind legs and tumbling to the ground.

They would stand and face each other in a circle and start pushing and biting - as if they were dancing.

Meanwhile, their mother was always there and watched closely in case other bears came close to them.

Valtteri said: 'These cubs were born this spring. There are four, but one is missing as the instructor said he was born very weak and probably did not survive.

'It was interesting to observe that they are all different in character - some were bullies and others avoided fights and were calm.

'Most of their scenes are reminiscent of characters from fairy tales about bears where all the bears walk on their hind legs and twist dance.

'It wasn’t scary because the photographs were taken from a small cottage so security was guaranteed.'

This is the adorable moment a mother showed her cubs the bear necessities of fishing - and rewarded them with a high five.

The mother bear began her lesson by wading through a river towards spawning salmon with her three offspring trailing behind her.

She clambered over a fallen tree with ease and patiently waited for the youngsters as they struggled to pull themselves over it.

The group of grizzly bears then jumped into the water and tried to copy their mum as she took deft swipes at the fish.

After showing the one-year-old cubs the ropes the kindhearted bear then shared her catch with the youngsters before giving one of them a high five.

The amusing encounter was caught on camera by wildlife photographer Don Johnston in British Columbia, Canada.

Don Johnston, 62, a retired biology teacher from Ontario, said: 'Thes pictures were taken last fall in the Chilcotin wilderness.

Touching: Don Johnston, 62, a retired biology teacher from Ontario, said: 'occasionally the cubs would swim out with mother and share fish with her in the river'

'We saw mother grizzlies and cubs who are attracted to spawning sockeye salmon and we observed them hunting for salmon along the riverbank.

'The bears tend to take dead or dying salmon, after they have spawned, and once the mother brings in a fish she shares it with the young.

'The first-year cubs observed and played but occasionally the cubs would swim out with mother and share fish with her in the river.

'I can only guess what was going on with the 'high five' image and I think the young bears were playful and this was a lucky pose.'
