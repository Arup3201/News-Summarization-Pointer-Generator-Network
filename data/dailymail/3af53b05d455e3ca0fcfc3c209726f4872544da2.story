A convicted sex offender wanted on charges he molested a 3-year-old girl in West Virginia has been found hiding in a makeshift fort in the Pennsylvania woods.

US marshals helped local police and the sheriff's office in Brook County, West Virginia, track down 64-year-old David David Tuesday.

Brooke County Sheriff Chuck Jackson said the tiny wooden shack David called home was 'elaborate.' Among other things, it included a heater, a propane tank, electricity, a police scanner and knives.

David was found in Hanover Township, Washington County, in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, reported CBS Pittsburgh.

West Virginia authorities have been looking for the fugitive since he was accused two weeks ago of molesting a co-worker's young daughter.

David is a convicted sex offender who also was wanted for not registering under Megan's Law for a 1999 molestation case.

David D. David had been hiding in the woods behind a rural church on Steubenville Pike for a couple of weeks until local residents contacted authorities about his presence.

At around 2.30pm Tuesday, some 30 law enforcement officials from various agencies converged on David’s hideout and arrested him without incident.

Speaking to WTOV9, the young victim’s mother said her boyfriend had met David at work a few months back and befriended him.

About three weeks ago, the 64-year-old moved his RV closer to his new friends’ property in Follansbee, West Virginia.

Two days later, the child’s mother said David lured her 3-year-old and her sibling with candy and Popsicles into his camper and assaulted the toddler.

‘You are a disgusting specimen of a man you need to turn yourself in and act like a man. Take responsibility for what you did to my baby girl,’ said the child’s grandmother.

David David was arraigned Tuesday night in Pennsylvania and is now awaiting extradition back to West Virginia.

Authorities are concerned that David may have victimized other children in Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley.
