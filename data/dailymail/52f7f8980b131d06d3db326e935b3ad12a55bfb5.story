Serious injuries to Ben Foster and Fraser Forster have rocked the England squad and Roy Hodgson made no attempt to pretend otherwise.

‘We thought we had three top-class goalkeepers and now we only have one,’ said the England boss.

It probably wasn’t what Rob Green and Jack Butland wanted to hear, but at least he was honest.

‘We were devastated,’ said Hodgson, when asked about Forster, who could be out for the rest of the year after surgery to mend a broken knee-cap.

Roy Hodgson said: 'We thought we had three top-class goalkeepers and now we only have one’

‘I’ve been in touch but there’s not much you can do to cheer him up. It’s the same with Ben Foster, who will be out for the rest of the season and a good way into next. 

'It is a good opportunity for every goalkeeper in the country to show me what they can do. In the past we thought people were hard to replace but others came along.’

Forster, 27, was hurt when he collided with Burnley's Sam Vokes while clearing the ball in Southampton's 2-0 win on Saturday. 

It's estimated he could be out of action for between nine months and a year.

West Brom's Foster will be out for six months after surgery found he had damaged his anterior cruciate ligament. The injury in the Baggies' victory over Stoke was initially thought to be cartilage damage but an exploratory operation found it to be much worse.  

QPR's Green has been called up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday and friendly against Italy on Tuesday, joining England Under 21's first-choice Jack Butland.

England's No 1 Joe Hart, the remaining 'world class' keeper for Hodgson, admitted that the injuries to Foster and Forster hit the England camp hard but backs Green to step into the void.

'I was gutted for Ben and Fraser. It’s really, really sad news. It has rocked us all as a goalkeeping group and rocked all the lads in the squad because they are great guys and they are having a great season,' the Manchester City keeper said.

'But Greeny has come in and hopefully he can profit. He did brilliant in the Championship last year. I remember watching him in the play-off final, when he was man of the match for me. QPR are in a bad position but he has been fantastic this season.

'Greeny is rock solid. His mentality is great. And he is a very good goalkeeper who has been playing at the top level for a long time. There are no surprises.'
