Expectations of continued rises in house prices hit a 14-year high in November, with almost two-thirds of surveyors predicting the value of homes will increase as demand outstrips supply.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said on Tuesday that 59 per cent of surveyors forecast prices would rise over the next three months, the highest reading since September 1999.

A record level of surveyors also predicted sales will pick up in the coming months.

However, Rics warned that without a 'meaningful increase' in the supply of homes, both house prices and rents will become more unaffordable.

It said the reading for the number of surveyors predicting price rises rather than falls is the highest since September 1999 and demonstrates the impact that the recovery is having on an 'anaemic supply' of properties for sale in the housing market.

In what Rics said is a 'sharp' pick-up, a balance of 58 per cent more surveyors also reported already seeing house price growth last month. For the second month in a row, each region of the UK saw prices rise.

House sales have also lifted strongly compared with a year ago. An average of just over 20 homes per surveyor were sold in the three months to November, compared with around 15 during the same period last year.

The housing market has been showing strong signs of recovery throughout 2013 following a string of Government schemes such as Help to Buy and Funding for Lending which have widened mortgage availability and fuelled demand from buyers.

A new phase of the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched in October to give more people with low deposits a helping hand on to or up the housing ladder.

The scheme offers state-backed loans to 
people with deposits as low as 5 per cent and lenders representing 
around two-thirds of the mortgage market have confirmed they will take 
part.

But experts have said that stronger efforts must also be made to increase the number of homes on the market, with the mismatch between supply and demand putting an upward pressure on prices.

Last week, Halifax reported that house prices rose by 7.7 per cent in November, marking the highest increase seen in six years.

In his Autumn Statement last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced £1billion of loans to unblock large housing developments, including in Manchester and Leeds, and raising a borrowing limit for councils to fund new homes.

But housing charity Shelter called for 'bolder ideas' for more affordable homes to be built.

Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist, said: 'It's no secret that the housing market is on the way up and prices are surging ahead in many parts of the country.'

He continued: 'As the Chancellor pointed out last week, housebuilding is on the up, but it is rising nowhere near quickly enough to make up the shortfall that has built up in recent years.

'If there is not a meaningful increase in new homes, the likelihood is that prices, and for that matter rents, will continue to push upwards, making the cost of shelter ever more unaffordable.'

The Funding for Lending scheme which has been credited with boosting mortgage availability generally is being re-directed away from households to help small businesses.

The number of mortgages on the market has increased by around 40 per cent since Funding for Lending was launched last year.

Mr Osborne also announced last week that non-UK residents will have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) on property sales from April 2015.

This is expected to take some of the heat out of the London housing market as strong house price growth in the English capital has been put down in part to overseas investors looking for a safe haven to place their cash.
