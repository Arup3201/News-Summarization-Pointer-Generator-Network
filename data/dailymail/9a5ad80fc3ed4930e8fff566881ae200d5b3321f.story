An Australian man who was seriously injured when he was gored by a bull at Spain’s famous San Fermin festival has spoken of the sheer panic he felt as he was chased by the animal with a gaping wound to his leg.

Jason Gilbert, a mechanic from Adelaide Hills in South Australia, underwent several hours of surgery at Pamplona’s Virgen del Camino Hospital after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday.

Doctors said the horn that penetrated the 25-year-old's chest came dangerously close to touching soft tissue in his neck, but miraculously none of his vital organs were damaged.

In recovery: Jason Gilbert was gored at Pamplona's running of the bulls and had to have surgery for his injuries at Virgen del Camino hospital. The 25-year-old Australian said he would never take part in the event again

Lucky to be alive: The bull's horn penetrated Mr Gilbert's chest and came dangerously close to spearing the soft tissues in his neck. He was pinned against the wall for several moments while he was gored by the animal

Torn open: He only realised the severity of his injuries when he looked at his leg

'It’s the first time I’ve run and I can tell you now it will be the last,' Mr Gilbert said from his hospital bed.

'I felt like I was running for my life as it chased after me the first time it gored me.

'I was in pain and I knew it was bad when I saw my leg was wide open. It was a feeling of sheer and utter panic being chased by the bull.'

The 595kg bull named Olivito went on a rampage after becoming separated from the rest of the pack when it slipped and crashed into a wall.

Mr Gilbert was pinned against the wall as the bull gored him in the left leg before chasing him and attacking him for a second time as other thrill-seekers and paramedics tried desperately to pull him through the fence sealing off the 850m course.

'I didn’t see the bull fall but I realised I was in trouble when it got back up and trapped me against a wall,' he said.

'After that I really just remember being pulled through the fence by people on the other side. It probably saved my life. Seeing the paramedics and knowing I was out of immediate danger was a feeling of tremendous relief.'

Mr Gilbert - who ran wearing a T-shirt with the words 'Real Men Wear Skirts' emblazoned across the chest -  had only arrived in Pamplona just 24 hours before he was injured with three friends he is travelling around Europe with. They are just two weeks into a six-week trip.

He said he decided to take part in the last run of the festival after going to watch a bullfight in the town's bullring the day he arrived.

'I spoke with a Spanish man at the bullfight who told me about the number of people who take part and the number of people who get injured every year and I thought "Why not?",' he said.

‘I watched the World Cup final and went to bed after that because I wanted to run the following day.

The bull broke away from the pack and charged several runners, including Mr Gilbert who is seen hear being lifted off the ground by the bull's horns during the eighth run at Spain's famous San Fermin festival

The bull attacked the 25-year-old with such ferocity that it sent bits of wall flying before goring the Australian in his left leg

Mr Gilbert stood little chance against the bull's mighty horns, which ripped his shorts and left a large chunk of skin missing

'It was my first time in Pamplona and I’d seen the morning runs on the television before so I knew of the dangers involved.

'I grew up in a regional town and have seen a lot of cattle so I know how powerful bulls are. What shocked me about the bull that gored me was just how aggressive it was.'

Doctors say Mr Gilbert will most likely remain in hospital for a week after suffering the gash to his leg, a punctured lung and broken rib.

The 25-year-old said while he had no regrets about running, he would not be participating again.

'It's a local tradition and I respect Spaniards who run it every year but I've done it now and got it out of my system and with what's happened, I don't want to repeat,' he said.

As the Australian thrill-seeker lifted his legs in a bid to protect himself, the bull thrust its horn through his thigh

Mr Gilbert's friends only realised he had been gored after seeing the images posted repeatedly online. A Spanish friend helped them track down Mr Gilbert and they arrived at the hospital four hours after he was injured.

'I've spoken to family and friends. My parents knew I was going to run and my dad already knows I was hurt,' Mr Gilbert said.

'I haven't spoken to my mum yet and I'm sort of dreading it I suppose. I know she's not going to be very happy.'

He said he will wait until he is released from hospital before deciding whether to continue with his trip around Europe or return straight home.

A second Australian, James Andrew Metcalfe from Grenfell in NSW, was left with a 5cm gash to his right thigh after he was gored by the bull in the same area Mr Gilbert was hurt.

First aiders were packing up and the other injured were already in hospital when Mr Metcalfe, 24, sought help.

He was discharged from hospital later the same morning after receiving treatment. Doctors described his injury as ‘slight.’

Spaniard Enaut Gorriz, 21, from the village of Burlades near Pamplona, was also gored three times. He suffered a 10cm gash to his left thigh and a 15cm gash to his right thigh.

Mr Enaut, an architecture student, was taking part in the adrenalin-filled run for the first time.

Seven people needed hospital treatment after the last run.

Ten of the 47 runners taken to hospital during this year’s festival remained in hospital on Tuesday.

Fifteen people have been killed at the annual festival since records began in 1911.

Pinned down: But the bull again caught him and pinned him to a barrier as others tried to ward him off

Finally, with the help of a few police officers, Mr Gilbert managed to get behind the fence where he was promptly taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries

The bull would not give up its hunt for the man who had so infuriated it and continued ramming him against the fence

Fellow Australian Nicholas Kordahi told Sydney radio station Triple M's The Grill Team he was also at the running of the bulls when he was charged by one of the beasts, sustaining injuries to his side and ankle.

Mr Kordahi shot some footage of the moment the animal made its way towards him and his friends, and described it on air as 'one of the most adrenaline fueling scariest moments I've ever had in my life. Me and my two friends were shaking before the gun went.'

Several men have already been gored by bulls during this year's festival but Monday's run, the eighth and last, was particularly brutal.

One of the six bulls broke away from the others and charged several runners, lifting two of them off the ground on its horns and ripping through their legs.

Other participants tried to distract the bull and eventually herded it into the ring. The runs usually last between three to five minutes, and the bulls then appear in an evening bullfight, when they are killed.
