An elephant never forgets…a voice.

A study found the gentle giants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people, simply by listening to recordings of their voices.

Not only could the African elephants tell the two languages apart, they could also work out if the speaker was a man or a woman and an adult or a child.

Elephants never forget...a voice: The gentle giants can distinguish a warlike tribe from a more peaceable people, simply by listening to recordings of their voices. Not only could the African elephants (stock image) tell the two languages apart, they could also work out if the speaker was a man or a woman and an adult or a child

This is despite the recordings being just a few seconds long.

The researchers, including conservationist Cynthia Moss, believe the creatures use voice and language to help them work out which humans pose a threat to them.

They can then choose whether to defend themselves against attack or continue going about life as usual.

The researchers began my making recordings of members of two Kenyan tribes repeating the phrase ‘Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming’.

One tribe was the Massai, who historically killed elephants as a rite of passage on entering adulthood. They also take revenge when elephants kill their cattle.

The second was the Kamba, who farm crops and have a more amicable relationship with the elephants.

The tapes were then played through loudspeakers to groups of elephants in the Amboseli National Park in Kenya and their reactions noted.

The animals were clearly more scared of the Massai and bunched together defensively on hearing them speak.

They also used their trunks to sniff at the air on hearing a Massai voice, likely in an attempt to pick up smells that would provide more information about the intruder.

As the same phrase was used in all the recordings and it was spoken in the same way each time, it is believed the animals were able to tell the two languages apart.

Their skill didn’t end there. The elephants were also more likely to act defensively on hearing a male Massai than female.

They were also more likely to retreat on hearing a grown man than a boy.

Elephants grieve like humans and are believed to suffer from post traumatic stress

Grieving: Elephants grieve like humans, shedding tears and taking part in rituals to 'bury' bodies.

And the damaging effects of grief from death - especially of a parent - stay with them for decades, according to recent research at the University of Sussex.

The study has found that African elephants who were orphaned by a cull in Kruger National Park in the 1970s and 1980s are still suffering post-traumatic stress.

Singing: The large creatures use an ultrasound rumble - often too low for humans to hear - to keep a herd together and for males to find mates. By doing this, they can communicate six miles away

Sneaking: Elephants carry out raids on crops when the nights are the darkest and scientists have found that their foraging expeditions in Africa tend to vary with the lunar cycle.

Fewer raids take place during a full moon when farmers are more likely to spot the animals plundering their crops.

It is thought that elephants deliberately alter their behaviour to reduce the risks of encountering humans.

Remembering: Older elephants remember dangerous situations and are able to best make crucial decisions about predators, based on their previous perilous experiences.

When scientists played families lion roars from a loudspeaker, those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the most adept killers.

Pointing: A study published last year found that jungle elephants instinctively known what pointing means - and are the only animal capable of this feat.

Professor Richard Byrne from St Andrews University said: ‘What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival.’
