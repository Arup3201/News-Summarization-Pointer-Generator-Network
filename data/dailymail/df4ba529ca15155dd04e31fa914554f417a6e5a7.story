With its steel grey exterior and makeshift wooden ramp, it looks no more than a workman’s hut.

But this small metal container is in fact a visitor centre which has opened at Colwyn Bay on the north Wales coast.

Measuring no more than two by three metres, the ‘centre’ has been put in place to give the public an insight into the redevelopment of the beachfront.

However, the unit, which is situated near the once magnificent but now derelict Victoria Pier, has hardly been a hit with visitors.

Since it was installed in April, it has faced a huge amount of backlash and its guest book has become full of sarcastic comments about its appearance.

One visitor, called Philippa, wrote in the book: 'Was a bit c***, couldn't even get on the beach, got threatened and had to leave. Very disappointing.'

Jane Blythe, visiting the waterfront from Prestatyn with her two children, said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. It does look very bleak.

'It's not exactly the most enticing sight but it does include information on the work.  

'We had heard how good the beach was last summer so we didn't expect more work to be going on.'

She added: 'It just seems funny to me that they use this little box as a visitor centre when the big building over there - Porth Eirias, a recently-built leisure centre - is pretty much empty.' 

Colwyn Bay is a popular resort on the north Wales coast and attracts thousands of visitors each year

One visitor from Penrhyn Bay said: 'Nice beach, nice weather, no access. Why does Conwy Council get everything the wrong way round?

'Hope this project is not another big white elephant like all the rest.'

On Twitter, Clwyd West MP David Jones was equally scathing of the portable cabin.

He wrote: 'How could anyone seriously think that would entice visitors in?

'Couldn't they use Porth Eirias as a temporary visitor centre? It's not as if there's a shortage of space there.'

And Gareth Daniels, a tourism graduate who works for North Wales Tourism, wrote: 'How can you brand a destination as "thriving" or "emerging" when you have this greeting tourists?'

A Conwy Council spokesman was unavailable for comment.

Nestled at the foothills of Snowdonia and with the Pwllychrochan Woods as a backdrop, Colwyn Bay attracts thousands of visitors every year. 

Holidaymakers have a range of activities to choose from when staying at Colwyn Bay, including a visit to the Welsh Mountain Zoo, which is home to several endangered species, and the Theatr Colwyn – which is the oldest cinema in the UK.

Nearby Conwy Castle, a World Heritage Site, is also a popular attraction for holidaymakers and groups of schoolchildren who travel from across the country to visit the medieval grounds.

The seaside town of Colwyn Bay also boasts an award-winning beach with three miles of golden sand, making it popular with families.
