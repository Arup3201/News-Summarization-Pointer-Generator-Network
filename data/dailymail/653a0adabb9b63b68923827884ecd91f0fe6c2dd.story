Miss America defended her crown and reputation today as she spoke out for the first time on allegations that she was kicked out of her college sorority for brutal hazing.

Kira Kazantsev from Long Island, New York, told GMA on Tuesday that the allegations were not only untrue but incredibly hurtful.

The 22-year-old said: 'Under the broad definition of hazing, I was involved... It was part of the culture at Hofstra at the time.'

Miss America Kira Kazantsev admitted to being involved in hazing while part of the Alpha Phi sorority at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York. She was later kicked out of the sorority for alleged brutal hazing 

Not nice: New Miss America Kira Kazantsev was allegedly kicked out of her sorority last year for hazing pledges 

Miss Kazantsev, who beat 52 other young women to become Miss America 2015 last week, also described the hazing she had taken part as an Alpha Phi sorority sister at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York.

She said the hazing consisted of 'having to stand in a line and recite information, perform mundane tasks and participate in 'crafting... and a few traditional things'.

The newly-minted Miss America was expelled from the sorority last year for alleged brutal hazing of new recruits. 

She claimed she was asked to leave the sorority after she made a joke which was taken out of context. 

Miss Kazantsev claimed on Tuesday that she was kicked out of her sorority last year for making a joke which was taken the wrong way

'I was asked by an educator to reach out to new students and I made a joke which was taken out of context and sent to the national office,' she said.

'The joke was that we would make the evening scary for the pledges at an event which never came to fruition.'

Following the allegations, Miss Kazantsev said she hoped to turn the negative experience into a positive.

The pageant winner, who stood on a platform of anti-domestic violence, said she would share the message with her young fans that it's ok to make mistakes in life. 

Miss Kazantsev, formerly Miss New York, won the national competition with her sweet performance of Pharrell's song 'Happy' choreographed with a cup.

On her resume, Kazantsev lists that she was new member educator and recruitment committee president for the university's chapter of Alpha Phi, a position she reportedly shared with her best friend in the spring term of 2013.

A source told Jezebel that Kazantsev and her friend made the pledges' lives 'a living hell' by calling them names, and berating them over physical flaws. 

The sorority sisters reportedly made the new members perform certain physical tasks to the point of bruising and exhaustion.

When someone reported the harsh punishments, Kazantsev and her friend were kicked out of the sorority, near the end of her senior year. 

They were banned from attending any sorority events, but allegedly sneaked into the society's end-of-year formal with their dates anyway.

After she was crowned Miss America for 2015 last week, neither the university or the sorority issued statements of congratulations.

When a Jezebel reporter called up the university to ask about a 'high-profile individual who was expelled from her sorority in late April 2013', a representative said 'Was this person, by chance, in Atlantic City last Sunday night?'

However, that representative wasn't allowed to say more on the disciplinary matter, per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA.  

The Miss America organization has since issued a statement on the hazing allegations, saying Kira has been  'fully transparent' about her termination from Alpha Phi. 

'It's unfortunate that this incident has been exploited to create a story line that distracts from what we should be focusing on: Kira's impressive academic achievements at Hofstra University, including earning a triple major from the Honors College and her commitment to serving her community. 

'Kira is an exceptional ambassador for the Miss America Organization, and we are excited to be a part of her journey as a force for good across our nation, promoting education and service and working to empower young women,' the statement reads.

Kazantsev graduated from the Long Island university in 2013 with honors and three degrees in Political Science, Geography and Global Studies.

The daughter of Russian immigrants, Kazantsev is fluent in English, Spanish and Russian. 

She was the third-consecutive Miss New York to be crowned Miss America, and has viciously defended her internship at Planned Parenthood. 

'It was close to my university and I care about women's health.

'It's really important that teens know what resources are available to them and learn to be respectful of their bodies and other peoples' bodies,' she told Cosmopolitan.
