A mother who was taunted at school for her love of sports and branded a ‘wimp’ by her bullying ex-boyfriend has fought back by becoming a professional bodybuilder.

Heather Crowley, 49, from Baddeley Green, Staffordshire became deeply self-conscious after she got divorced at the age of 30 - and more so after the abusive relationship that followed.

But after ditching the man who was making her life misery, she hit the gym daily and last month took part in the internationally acclaimed Miss Galaxy Universe contest.

Heather finished an impressive 5th out of 120 contestants from around the world and is now preparing for the National Amateur Bodybuilder's Association (NABBA) Miss Universe, by which time she will be 50.

Heather, who has a son Tom, 23 said: 'At school I was always good at sports and enjoyed it but got picked on for that and because I was a happy bouncy person.

'Later in life I was bullied at work and, in my 30s, I found myself being bullied by a guy that I was in a relationship with.

'He emotionally abused me, threatened me and called me a wimp. He knew how to get at me putting me down. He made me feel so worthless and I hit rock bottom.

 'At work my
 boss harassed me because I rejected his advances. He made my life hell,
 made fun of me and made me look incompetent by laughing at me and 
taunting me when no-one was around.'

Weights: Heather, pictured here, says: 'I have a passion for getting the body trained. I want to do more and if someone does a challenge then I want to do it too'

Strong: 'I have always loved fitness,' says Heather. 'At 30 I got divorced and started weight training but it wasn't until last year that I really started to dedicate myself to it'

Heather resigned, with no other job lined up and a young son to take care of. While figuring out her next career move, she started to hit the gym.

'I started training to get me out of the house,' she says. 'I have always loved fitness.

'At 30 I got divorced and started weight training but it wasn’t until last year that I really started to dedicate myself to it.

'I love it, I have a passion for getting the body trained. I want to do more and if someone does a challenge then I want to do it too.

'If I go running then I always want to run faster. Put
 me in a spin class and I would be bored to death but put me on high 
intensity training where you see fast results and I love it.'

Heather undertakes a punishing three-and-a-half hour daily gym work which starts at 4.45am in order to stay in shape.

Dedicated: 'I have six to eight meals a day that all have to be prepared in advance,' says Heather, pictured here working out

She is also going to star in a TV documentary to air next year.

Heather said: 'I start with cardio at 4.45am and then after work I will train at the gym from 6.30pm until 9pm.

'I have six to eight meals a day that all have to be prepared in advance. I normally start with oats, egg whites or blueberries.

'I eat a lot of turkey with fresh vegetables like green beans or asparagus. I only allow myself a cheat meal on a Saturday and my only downfall is chocolate buttons so I have to make sure I don’t eat too many of them.

'I set myself a challenge to find the confidence to get back on stage 18 months ago and joined a proper bodybuilding gym.

'It took some courage to get there as very few women training on weights but it was the best decision I ever made.'

Miss Galaxy Universe founder Sarah Donohue said: 'The girls compete in tests that comprise of things like shuttle runs, bench presses, push-ups, squats and long jumps and then there is a bikini section.

'Heather always motivates the other girls, she pushes herself to the maximum and is a brilliant role model.'
