The legendary deep-fried Mars bar has become the symbol of everything that is wrong with the artery-clogging Scottish diet.

But now an unlikely cross-Border skirmish has broken out after a London firm applied to patent the fat and sugar-laden ‘delicacy’.

Crispy Candy, based in Camden Market, claims its technique produces a tastier and healthier deep-fried Mars bar than the Scottish version.

It involves chilling the chocolate bars before frying them in batter made from buttermilk imported from the US.

Now the firm’s owner, Garry Davis, has lodged an application with the patent  office in London which, if approved, would stop anyone else copying his technique.

But the Scottish chip shop that claims to have given the world the deep-fried Mars bar has accused Mr Davis of ‘piggy backing’ on its calorie-laden creation.

Mr Davis, 33, charges Londoners £3 for his deep-fried bar – The Mars Meltdown – compared with the £1.50 typically charged north of the Border.

He said: ‘It took us about six months to develop the perfect way of frying chocolate bars.

'We’ve taken the deep-fried Mars bar and changed it into something more of an indulgent dessert.

‘It’s all about storing them at the correct temperature and using a different kind of batter – which means that you’re left with a lovely, fluffy, gooey mouthful instead of an oil-filled crispy bar that many chip shops serve.’

The Intellectual Property Office – formerly known as the Patent Office – is now considering application b1218841.3 from Mr Davis, which concerns a ‘cooking method’.

He said: ‘I want to protect our scientific way of making the treat instead of the actual bar itself. We’re proud of our technique.’

The Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, is first credited with dipping Mars bars in batter and plunging them in to the fat fryer.

Last year it ended up in a row with Mars, which complained it had not ‘authorised’ the use of its product.

Owner Lorraine Watson said: ‘We have been serving deep-fried Mars bars for more than 20 years now. Mr Davis obviously heard about our issue with Mars last year and is trying to piggyback on it.

You're bar-ed: A patent would mean that Crispy Candy's Mars bar, which are chilled before they are dipped in a special batter made from American buttermillk, would be protected

She added: ‘No matter what happens, the deep-fried Mars bar was born here in Scotland. It is, and always will be, Scottish.

‘The way we do it works and it will continue to be popular with everyone who visits for years to come.’

However, top Scots pastry  chef Mark Greenaway said the English could keep it as far as he was concerned.

Mr Greenaway, who runs a restaurant in Edinburgh and represented Scotland on BBC series The Great British Menu, said: ‘If this guy from London wants to claim the deep-fried Mars bar, then he is more than welcome to it.

‘The sooner Scotland gets rid of this image of the deep-fried Mars bar as the national dish, the better.

‘We have so many other better Scottish delicacies to celebrate. The whole idea of deep-fried  chocolate is just strange.’
