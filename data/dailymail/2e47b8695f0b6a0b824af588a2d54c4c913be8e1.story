Celebrities and other residents who lived in apartments destroyed by an explosion in New York City are mourning the loss of their homes.

Three buildings in the city's East Village collapsed following the gas-related explosion on Thursday afternoon, leaving 22 people injured - including four critically - and two people unaccounted for.

Sopranos actress Drea de Matteo had an apartment at 123 Second Avenue, and previously lived there with other celebrities, including designer Charlotte Ronson.

'NYC's finest trying to put out the flames to mine n many others apartments. Speechless…,' the 43-year-old wrote beside an Instagram photo of the blaze. '[Praying] for those that are hurt.'

Ronson posted an image of the fire as she sent her condolences to de Matteo.

Musician Donald Cumming, pictured on stage and right, was seen outside his destroyed apartment in tears

Indie rock star Donald Cumming, who also had an apartment in one of the collapsed buildings, was seen in tears trying to get through a police cordon to the scene of the blast.

The 33-year-old singer, from the band The Virgins, was chaperoned by an NYPD officer as he tried to get back home. He declined to speak but confirmed he had been a resident of the building. 

Fellow musicians from the band Public Access T.V. had lived in a first-floor apartment in 123 Second Avenue - one of the buildings that collapsed - since 2010 but assured their fans they were safe. They are currently on tour on the West Coast.

'We've got a lot of messages about our apartment burning down in New York today,' frontman John Eatherly wrote on their Facebook page. 'We are all safe. Very very lucky. Thoughts go out to everyone else affected by it and the firefighters.'

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Eatherly added that as well as living at the apartment, the band used it to rehearse. They lost some gear and tapes but are just relieved they were not inside.

'I was shaking watching it,' he said. 'Just hoping that no one got hurt. It felt like one of those things that you never think is going to happen to you.'

Among others who lost their homes and belongings are married couple Nora and Matt Brooks.

The couple, who lived on the top floor of 123 Second Avenue, had been visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with Mrs Brooks' parents when the building exploded, the Daily Beast reported.

They got a call from their roommate - who managed to clamber from the apartment to safety - who broke the horrifying news. She said their cat had run away when she tried to grab it.

Matt, a puppet builder for Henson who had lived at the apartment since 1991, lost cameras, other filming equipment and valuable puppets in the blast, according to friends who set up a gofundme page for the couple. His wife is a graduate student at The New School and lost all of her books.

Missing: Tom Walker hands out fliers of a missing 14-year-old cat, whose owners lived at 121 Second Avenue but are on vacation away from the city. He said he hopes the beloved pet will be found alive

Assurance: Frontman John Eatherly assured followers that all members of the band were safe on Thursday

Witness: Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas lives just across the street and commended the response

Close to home: Actress Mara Wilson also expressed her shock about the fire on Twitter

'Nora and Matt Brooks need help from their communities at this time,' reads the page, which aims to raise $12,000. 'They have lost everything.'

Neighbors are also seeking a second missing cat. Tom Walker handed out fliers of a missing 14-year-old Siamese cat, Sago, whose owners, Tom Schmidt and Kim Modes, lived at 121 Second Avenue but were on vacation when the blast occurred. 

Actress Sarah Hyland also previously lived in the area and shared her condolences on Twitter.

'I grew up across the street. Thinking of my childhood neighborhood,' the Modern Family star said.

Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, who lives down the street from the blast, posted a couple of videos showing smoke billowing into the sky.

'An explosion just happened one block from our apartment in NYC. Terrifying,' she captioned one video, adding: 'Courageous Fire Fighters here in NYC. No hesitation.' 

Intense flames consumed the buildings on Second Avenue and 7th Street following the explosion at 3.15pm on Thursday - about an hour after Con Edison inspectors visited the building and found the gas-related work being done there 'unacceptable,' according to officials.

'Preliminary evidence suggests a gas-related explosion,' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. 

He said the incident 'appears to have been caused by plumbing and gas work that occurred in 121 2nd Avenue' and that the investigation is ongoing.

There were no reports of a gas leak to either Con Edison or 911 before the incident. 

The state Department of Public Service is monitoring Con Ed's response, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

'We are praying that no other individuals are injured and that there are no fatalities,' he added. 

After the explosion, the site of the blast and two neighboring buildings caught alight, eventually causing all three to crumble to the ground - leaving a massive hole on the end of the block. 

Two people are unaccounted for, the NYPD said.

Nicholas Figueroa, 23, was on a date at the sushi restaurant where the explosion happened.

His date was taken to hospital with a broken nose, but Figueroa has not been located. Payment records show he had paid for the meal at Sushi Park minutes before the blast. 

The second missing person, Moises Lucon of Queens, worked as a bus boy at the restaurant. 

Twenty-two people were injured, four of them critically. Five first responders, among them four firefighters and an EMS worker, also suffered minor injuries.

Two of the critical patients have been taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Cornell suffering from burns to their airways.
