An artist has bought to life the visions he sees in the sky.

In a project called Cloud Shaping, Madrid-based Martin Feijoo sketches quirky interpretations of what he sees when he looks up at the sky.

He said: 'I started shaping clouds during my trip to Mexico last summer. I spent a lot of time on the road, so I admired the landscapes very often and for a long time. 

'One day I began to notice that cloud shapes was not like the clouds of Madrid. The sky was clear and the clouds were huge, misshapen and always changing.

'At the same time I remembered that idea someone told me when I was a child about the origin of the cloud shapes and, right there, both thoughts merged, so I started photographing clouds that seemed to me like something.

'As I started drawing clouds, I realised that if I added accessories to the characters it would make them funnier and at the same time, every cloud would have a story.'

The fur cap on the Russian was originally a wig but Martin adapted the image as he drew around the clouds on the light table base

Martin describes this little dog scampering across the sky as a 'rare' breed - and named the mutt 'Rock'

The artist spent a long time on the road in Mexico and found himself looking at the landscapes for hours on end

The drawings are influenced by stories Martin was told as a child about the origins of clouds, combined with his own creativity

Martin uses special transparent paper for his sketches. He places the photographs on light table and draws his creations over the top in black pen

Martin draws the first thing that comes into his mind when he sees the clouds, and some of the creations are surprisingly intricate

The clouds in Mexico served as a constant source of inspiration for Martin to created a weird and wonderful assortment of pictures

The artist has posted all of the images online on a Tumblr page under the name Shaping Clouds project so fans can view all his creations in one place
