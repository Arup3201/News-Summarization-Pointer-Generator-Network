'Trickster': Police are trying to figure out the true identity of 52-year-old Roy Antigua, pictured

Some may have known Roy Antigua as a CIA agent, a member of NASA or even a doctor - but all the police can be sure of is that he's a fake.

Officers in New Port Richey, Florida are appealing for the public's help after they unearthed a startling cache of fake ID cards and uniforms at Antigua's home - and want to know if he has ever posed in a position of authority.

They found U.S. military medals, identification cards from NASA, the CIA and Homeland Security, a flight helmet, uniforms from U.S. Customs and the Navy and even a diplomatic license plate.

In one particularly chilling discovery, officers also found a doctor's bag filled with equipment and a picture of Antigua holding a newborn baby while wearing scrubs.

'We need to know, from start to finish - who is Roy Antigua?' New 
Port Richey Police Chief James Steffens said at a news conference on Monday,Â Fox News reported.

Officers were led to the home after New Port Richey Police Officer Edward Campbell pulled Antigua over during a routine traffic stop, and was suspicious of the U.S. Coast Guard card he used as ID.

'It had a gold chip that was missing,' he said. 'The back of the ID resembled a hotel card.'

Antigua is in jail after being arrested for driving without a license and a parole violation, and police are appealing for help to determine if he has carried out any other crime.

While they cannot yet be certain that he used the ID cards and uniforms to trick people into believing a fake identity, they know he pretended to be a Coast Guard on at least one occasion.

Medals: Police found the uniforms after Antigua used a fake ID during a routine traffic stop

Steffans recalled seeing Antigua at a
Memorial Day event at a cemetery, where he was wearing a uniform and 
introduced himself as a 
Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander.

He
walked over to a special section for officials and sat next to the 
police chief in a move that Steffans said was an offense to veterans and
fallen soldiers.

'Everybody around there thought that he was the real deal,' Steffens said.

The only ID that proved genuine with an identification card for the Coast Guard Auxiliary in Miami.

Concerning: As well as ID badges, police also found a picture of Antigua holding a baby in scrubs, right

Worrying: Among the uniforms there were ones for the Boy Scouts of America, pictured

It is a volunteer team but Antigua was kicked out in 2011 after being arrested 
on a grand theft charge, MyFoxMiami reported.

According to the Department of Heath, he is also a licensed respiratory care 
practitioner, but detectives do not know where he was employed.

Officers also found a Boy Scout troop leader uniform - a discovery they found particularly frightening.

'It's actually scary. You see these Boy Scout uniforms, who knows if 
he's been around young children and what his intentions were,' an 
official told MyFoxTampaBay.com.

Authorities are trying to figure out whether he used the collection just to dress up - or for more sinister means.

Who is he? This picture, believed to be from Antigua's Facebook, shows him boarding a plane in uniform

Reminiscent: It brings to mind the film Catch Me If You Can starring Leonardo DiCaprio about a con man

Is he really a threat or is he someone who is living a very involved
fantasy life?' Steffans asked. 'You don't have this collection just to keep it in your house and look in the mirror.'

Antigua is currently being held without bail.

Steffens asked for anyone who might have dealt with Antigua to call his 
agency at (727) 841-4550.

The case brings to mind the film Catch Me If You Can, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life trickster Frank Anagnale, Jr., who makes bogus medical, legal and flight training documentation and has a vast selection of uniforms and ID cards.
