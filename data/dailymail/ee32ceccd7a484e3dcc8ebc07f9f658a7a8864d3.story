Three men were found dead in a BMW parked near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights neighbourhood in what authorities believe was a drug deal gone wrong.

The men were all in their 20s and were discovered around 6:30pm this evening on the outskirts of Columbia University's campus in a dark grey 2009 750 Li BMW.

Each appeared to have been shot in the skull, though there were no bullet holes in the car’s windows or doors, sources said.

Bloody scene: Three men were found dead in a brand new BMW near Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music

The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church, DNAInfo reported.

Police told reporters that two men were found in the front seats of the car, while a third was found in the back. Sources said that the shooter was likely sitting behind the driver when he unloaded his rounds.

The victims in the front were shot in the base of the skull and the passenger in the back was shot in the left temple and police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered.

'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.

'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.'

One source told the New York Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene.’

No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire.

'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may 
have used a silencer,' said a police source.

And 'he may have plugged 
his ears.'

Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall.

Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide, and have not yet released the name of the three victims.

According to the New York Daily News, the driver was Hispanic, and the man in the passenger’s seat was black.

They have not yet released the ethnicity of the man in the back seat.

'Oh my God, he’s dead. Kill me, kill me. I hope it’s a lie,' screamed a woman who claimed to be a girlfriend of one of the victims at the scene

‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman.

Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime

The police were alerted around 6:30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead.

Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia.

NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told reporters that authorities will go through surveillance video in hopes of putting the pieces together.

Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident.

The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.
