A couple have revealed how they lost an incredible 280lbs combined, with the motivation of being a positive influence for their four daughters.

In 2011, Robert and Jessica Foster, from Boulder, Colorado, had long neglected their health, with Robert weighing 327lbs and Jessica tipping the scales at 287lbs.

But in March 2012, just before Jess turned 30, they decided it was finally time to make a change, both for their own well-being and for the sake of their young children.

...and after: Today, thanks to a new passion for fitness, a mostly plant-based diet and a much healthier relationship with food, Robert and Jess are almost unrecognizable at 167lbs (pictured)

Now, thanks to a new passion for fitness, a mostly plant-based diet and a much healthier relationship with food, Robert and Jess are both down to a much slimmer 167lbs and are almost unrecognizable.

And it's all thanks to their children. 'It got to
 the point where we realized it didn't matter what we fed them,' Rob explained to CNN. 'If we weren't eating the same way or if we were overeating, they 
were going to follow our example.'

For Rob and Jess, being obese was a downward spiral; Jess, disheartened by the mean comments she got about her weight, would turn to food for comfort. And Rob was always too exhausted to play with his kids, so he'd lounge around and eat instead.

In 2012, after they had had several fruitless conversations over the years about making a change, Jess finally decided that enough was enough.

Transformation: Rob began making small changes - like playing tennis and turning down seconds at dinner. (Pictured left, before his weight loss, and right, after completing his first marathon in May)

A whole new woman: These days, Jess is down an amazing 120lbs, has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever

'There was that point I 
hated myself so much. I wasn't giving them the full me because I was 
disgusted,' she said of her family.

'You have to look in the mirror and say, "Am I 
going to allow this to continue or am I going to stand up and make those
 changes?" A light turned on upstairs.'

'I hated myself so much. I wasn't giving them the full me because I was disgusted'

So in 2012, Jess, who works in a bank, enrolled in Zumba classes.

Within just weeks, she had dropped 14lbs, and she began exercising even more regularly.

Even 
though Rob was more averse to the idea of exercise, calling the idea of going for a 
run 'unappealing to the point of agony,' he, too, began making small 
changes - like taking up tennis and turning down seconds at dinner.

Family matters: 'There was that point I hated myself so much,' Jess (pictured with Rob and their daughters) said of her motivation to get healthy. 'I wasn't giving them the full me because I was disgusted'

Step by step, the couple and their children began doing more and more physical activities together, taking advantage of the Colorado outdoors with hiking trips and swimming excursions.

The parents kept track of their diets with calorie-counting apps, and began cooking meals together rather than ordering or eating out.

By December, Rob was ready for his first 5K race. Although he finished way behind his wife, this first experience of physical competition motivated him to make even more changes.

Today, the father-of-four has completed a second 5K, a 10K race and a marathon, and he has shed an incredible 160lbs.

In it together: In December 2012, the couple ran their first race - a local 5K 'Ugly Sweater Run' (pictured). Jess finished ahead of Rob, but the race motivated both of them to move forward and focus on their health

What a difference a year makes: In December 2013 they ran the same race. Rob, who was down 140lbs by then, improved on the previous year's results by an incredible 14 minutes

Jess, who is down an amazing 120lbs, has shrunk from a size 24 to a size 10 and is happier than ever.

'We realized if we were overeating, our kids were going to follow our example'

Not only are they proud to be great role models for their kids, but they have a new appreciation for themselves and each other, too.

'I love myself. I like what I'm seeing in the mirror,' said Jess.

'I know there's some work to still be done, but I'm such a different person than I was before,' she added.
