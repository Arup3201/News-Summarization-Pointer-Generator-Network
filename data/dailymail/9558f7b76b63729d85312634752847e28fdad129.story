If you're fed up of scrambling for the sunbeds on holiday, we've found the perfect solution for you....the private Maldivian island of Coco Prive Kuda Hithi.

Not only will you have the pick of the sunbeds -- all perfectly prepared with coordinating cushions -- you're guaranteed never to have someone else's sun umbrella blocking your view of the ocean. With endless sandy beaches, there's plenty of paradise to go round.

The only potential spanner in the works is the £16,000 a night price-tag (plus the private seaplane airfare).

The exquisite Coco Prive Island in the Maldives is surrounded by turquoise water, white sandy shores and has a private chef, therapist, diving instructor and butler

But with unspoilt white sand, clear turquoise waters and beautiful lofty palms, you might just be able to put the mortgage out of mind.

Pictures inside the Indian Ocean property show that no expense has been spared in creating a space dripping in luxury.

The island,
 which sleeps 12 altogether, has one master residence named Palm 
Residence. Within this split-level retreat there's a huge master 
bedroom, living and dining areas filled with bespoke pieces, indoor and 
outdoor shower, private jacuzzi and exclusive wine cellar.

And no need for that last minute dash to WHSmiths at the airport -- you'll have your own library as well.

The swimming pool at the master villa features over-sized day-beds and a stunning ornamental garden make it the ultimate spot to relax

There
 are five other villas on the island. Starfish Villa and Heron Villa, 
which have twin or double beds, large private bathrooms, and spacious 
living areas opening out on to shared pool decking.

Outside, an enormous glass-sided swimming pool stretches half the length of the 
island with uninterrupted ocean views on one side and fabulous 
ornamental trees on the other.

And
 once you've enjoyed a dip, you can trot off to your own bar complete 
with glass drinks cabinet and as much alcohol as you care to consume!

Of course when it's time to wind down for dinner and wash off the 'stress' of the day, there's an outdoor bath for you to sink into -- with a choice of sumptuous lotions and potions.

And one isn't expected to lift a 
perfectly tanned finger either: A private chef, daily housekeepers, 
diving instructor and beauty and massage therapist are all available on demand.

Queuing for drinks? No way! On Coco Prive you have a private bar and wine cellar at your disposal -- and a butler to serve, of course

Kuda Hithi Island is the result of a 
collaboration between property developers Coco Privé and award-winning architect Guz 
Wilkinson.

It is described as: 'Your personal retreat in paradise; luxurious villas on your own private island express who you are, your passions and your place in the world. This is your space to breathe and escape; your home away from home.'

So
 what do you get for your for your £16,000 pounds -- apart from 
exclusive use of your own private island? All meals, 
(breakfast, lunch, dinner and all snacks) prepared by your personal 
chef, a selection of unlimited premium beverages (Champagnes, wine, 
spirits and soft drinks), a selection of daily spa treatments by your 
personal therapist (one treatment, per guest, per day) and for certified
 divers, one diving excursion session per day too.

You
 also have exclusive use of non-motorised watersports and diving 
equipment and facilities, laundry service and transfer to 
and from Malé International Airport.

Who's in?
