A young Briton who is lucky to be alive after falling 13 storeys from a New Zealand apartment block admitted today: 'I can't remember a thing about it.'                

But Englishman Tom Stilwell, 20, from Brighton added: 'Everyone tells me I'm a very lucky man to have survived.'                

Still in intensive care at Auckland City Hospital, Mr Stilwell has had operations for broken bones and internal injuries - but he has astonished medical experts with his amazing survival.

Doctors say that if he had not landed on the roof of an adjacent building - which prevented him falling a further two storeys - they have no doubt he would have been killed.

Mr Stilwell, who is on a working holiday in New Zealand, fell from a neighbour's 15th storey balcony in an impossible attempt to lower himself to the balcony of his own apartment on the 14th floor. 

He had found he was locked out of his high rise apartment and decided to ask his upstairs neighbour if he could go onto her balcony and drop down to his own.         

The neighbour, Geraldine Bautista, 28, said Mr Stilwell, who was 'a little bit tipsy', woke her up at two o'clock in the morning.                

'I wasn't scared of him,' she told the New Zealand Herald. 'He just requested "Can you please let me jump off from the balcony. I will not bother you, just let me use your balcony."    

'I never thought he would really do 
that. In my mind I thought "OK, I'll just let you see that it's really 
impossible." I didn't think he'd jump because it's really scary.'

But Mr Stilwell was determined to 
jump - as she soon found out. He walked through Miss Bautista's flat and
out onto her balcony, which is about 3ft wide and before she could 
react he had one leg over the railing.                

'I
asked him "Are you all right? It's unsafe to jump over the rail. He 
never said anything…I grabbed his hand and then at that time he fell 
down.                

'I
thought I was dreaming. It happened so fast; it happened in seconds. I 
couldn't even scream for help. He was like a paper falling from here.' 
                     

'He
can't remember anything about the fall,' said Mr Thomas, who spoke to 
his friend briefly yesterday. 'He's a very lucky man.'     

Mr Thomas said the two of them had been on a night out with fellow travellers when Mr Stilwell became separated from them and went home alone.                

'He'd had a fair bit to drink,' said Mr Thomas, 'but I was only 10 to 15 minutes behind him when I headed home.'                

He recalled that when he and a third flatmate reached the front door of their apartment block they were met by police searching for identification for the seriously injured man.                

'This isn't typical behaviour of him,' said Mr Thomas. 'He's normally the sensible one out of all of us.'

Medical experts are astonished at Mr Stilwell's survival. St John medical director Dr Tony Smith said survival from such a great height was 'extraordinary'.

'We've seen patients in Auckland who have had their falls broken by awnings over windows, umbrellas, those sorts of things,' he said.                

'But the roof this young man fell on to would not have prevented serious injury. From that sort of height you can have injuries to everything and anything. Survival from falls of that height are extraordinarily unusual.'                

Being under the influence of alcohol would not have relaxed the body to the point that serious injury would not occur, said Dr Smith.                 

'It's like being in a car crash. If you're going to hit something at speed, relaxed or not is not going to make much difference.'                

Mr Stilwell's friends said they have been told by doctors that if he continues to make progress he might be able to leave hospital in about a week to 10 days.
