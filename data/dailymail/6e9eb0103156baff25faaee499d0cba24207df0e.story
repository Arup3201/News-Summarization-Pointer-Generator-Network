John Carver has hit back at the ‘insulting’ comments of Phil Neville after he accused Newcastle’s players of ‘having their flip-flops on’.

The former Everton midfielder was critical of United’s players following their 3-0 defeat against the Toffees on Sunday.

But Carver has launched his own attack on the Match of the Day pundit.

‘I was pretty angry when I heard it, because he couldn't be any further form the truth,’ he said.

‘I think it's insulting and I think it's wrong, especially from ex-players. I'm sure if they were playing now they wouldn't like the comments, as I didn't.

‘What I did do was to inform the players about what these people had been saying. I thought it was important that they knew.

‘Now it's down to ourselves to show those people out there that we've not go our flip flops on.’

Meanwhile, Carver admits that injuries and suspension has left him with just 13 senior players to choose from for Saturday’s visit of Arsenal.

‘The good news is that I've not got a selection problem because I've only got 13 fit senior players,’ he said.

‘There's no sign of anyone coming back in the near future other than Mehdi Abeid who is a week or so away. We're working on Rolando Aarons, everyone else is more or less long term.

‘Siem de Jong went outside for a work out for the first time today (Thursday), which was nice to see.’
