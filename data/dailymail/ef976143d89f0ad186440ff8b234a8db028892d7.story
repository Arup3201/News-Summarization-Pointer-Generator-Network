Thousands of pro-democracy activists forced the temporary closure of the Hong Kong government's headquarters this morning amid clashes with police which broke out when demonstrators defied ordered to leave the area. 

Chaos erupted as commuters made their way to work, with officers engaged in a tense stand-off with hundreds of protesters who had surrounded Admiralty Centre - a vast complex which houses offices and retail outlets.

The central government offices and the legislature were forced to close during the stand-off, as were scores of shops.

The latest flare-up, during which police charged protesters with batons and pepper spray, marked an escalation in the civil disobedience movement which has seen sustained anti-government protests for the past two months. It also underscored the frustration of protesters at Beijing's refusal to budge on electoral reforms and grant greater democracy to the former British colony.

'The atmosphere in Admiralty is very different now after the clashes last night,' said Jessica Lam, 20, who returned to the protest site this morning. 'It has become very tense, like back to the early days when the protest just started.'

The democracy movement represents one of the biggest threats for China's Communist Party leadership since Beijing's bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy student protests in and around Tiananmen Square.

Hundreds of riot police scattered the crowds in several rounds of heated clashes overnight, forcing protesters back with pepper spray and batons as some tried to scramble over walls in a crush of bodies on a highway outside government headquarters.

Scores of volunteer medics attended to numerous injured, some who lay unconscious and others with blood streaming from head gashes. Police said at least 40 arrests were made.

David Cameron has warned China it is 'mistaken' and 'counter-productive to bar a British parliamentary fact-finding mission from Hong Kong. 

MPs are pressing for an emergency Commons debate after Beijing said it would not allow MPs from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee to enter the former British colony, where pro-democracy demonstrators have been staging protests since September.

Downing Street said that the action had 'amplified' concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, which has enjoyed a degree of autonomy from Beijing under the "one country, two systems" arrangements instituted at the time of its handover from UK control in 1997.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'The Prime Minister's view is that the decision with regard to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee is a mistaken one.

'We will continue to have a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on this, both through the Foreign Office here in London with the Chinese Embassy in London and through our embassy in Beijing.'

'The argument that we will be taking forward with the Chinese authorities is that the reason why the Prime Minister thinks it is a mistaken decision is because it is counter-productive. It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.'

Committee chairman Sir Richard Ottaway said they had been told by the Chinese embassy that they would be turned back if they tried to enter Hong Kong, which they had been planning to visit as part of an inquiry into its relations with the UK 30 years after the joint declaration.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said police had been very tolerant but would now take 'resolute action'.

'Some people have mistaken the police's tolerance for weakness,' he told reporters.

'I call for students who are planning to return to the occupation sites tonight not to do so,' said Leung, who did not respond when if police would clear the sites this evening.

As police tackled the running battles in Admiralty, tensions escalated across the harbour in the gritty working-class district of Mong Kok, which had been the scene of violent clashes in recent weeks before the clearance of a large protest encampment from a major road there last Wednesday. 

The unrest came as British lawmakers said they had been told by the Chinese Embassy they would not be allowed to enter Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into Britain's relations with its former colony and progress towards democracy.

The protesters are demanding free elections for the city's next leader in 2017 rather than the vote between pre-screened candidates that Beijing has said it would allow.

The overnight clashes came after student leaders called on activists to escalate their protests and surround government headquarters, galvanising supporters to make their way to the buildings in Admiralty, next to Hong Kong's central business district and some of the world's most expensive real estate.

Student representative Nathan Law urged protesters to continue the disobedience movement that began in late September, calling it a 'long journey'.

Despite several waves of clampdowns, crowds of protesters, many in protective goggles and body armour, refused to leave the area and continued to press against police lines, chanting 'We want universal suffrage!'. 

They threw bottles, helmets and umbrellas at police as tensions simmered into mid-morning.

Scores of demonstrators held up umbrellas, which have become a symbol of the pro-democracy movement, to protect themselves from the pepper spray and batons.

The latest clashes highlight the challenges authorities face as a restive younger generation contests Beijing's grip on the financial hub and demands greater democracy.

The Hong Kong rallies drew more than 100,000 on to the streets at their peak. Numbers have since dwindled and public support for the movement has waned.
