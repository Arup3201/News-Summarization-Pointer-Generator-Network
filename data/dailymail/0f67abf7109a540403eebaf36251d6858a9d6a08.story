The fugitive father of a two-year-old girl who drowned while strapped into her car seat in a New Jersey park was today charged with murder.

Tierra Morgan, of Lakehurst, was on a court-approved visit with her father Arthur Morgan III, 27, on Monday but he never brought her back.

Now authorities are looking for him after she was found dead on Tuesday by teenagers in Shark River Park, who told park rangers what they saw.

Tragedy: Tierra Morgan, right, of New Jersey, was having a court-approved visit with her father Arthur Morgan III, left, on Monday but he never brought her back

A warrant charging Morgan with child 
endangerment was issued before the girl's body was found and an autopsy 
will be done this morning.

But an abduction alert for Tierra was 
not issued because the state had no reason to believe the child was in 
danger until she was found dead.

He met the child’s mother Imani 
Benton, 24, at a supermarket on Monday to take her out for the rest of 
the day, reported the Asbury Park Press.

Morgan had not visited the child in a 
month and planned to take her to the park and watch the film ‘Happy Feet
Two’ at the cinema, friends said.

He was legally-obliged to return 
Tierra by 9pm but when he did not come back Ms Benton called police, the
girl’s grandmother told the newspaper.

'Student-aged children came across what they were concerned was a child in the creek'

What rangers told police

A 15-year-old boy was one of three 
teenagers who saw her hand sticking out of a river in Shark River Park 
and realised it was that of a child.

Park rangers then called police, saying ‘student-aged children came across what they were concerned was a child in the creek’.

The creek, about 20 miles north of 
where she lived, is up to 7ft deep in the area where the body was found,
near an overpass 15ft above the creek.

Ms Benton was told on Tuesday night her daughter was dead, just over 24 hours after she had left her with Morgan.

'The detectives came to my door and told 
me she was dead in the woods. I don’t 
know what I’m going to do'

Imani Benton

‘The detectives came to my door and 
told me she was dead in the woods,’ she told the Asbury Park Press. ‘I 
don’t know what I’m going to do.’

NJ Transit, Amtrak and the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey were assisting the FBI and the U.S.
Marshals Service in a search for Morgan on Wednesday.

Their hunt included train and bus stations, airports, bridges and tunnels.
