A seven-bedroom mansion would normally set you back millions of pounds, but a stately home in the Scottish borders is going on the market for just £1.

Whitehall Manor, in the Scottish Borders, is steeped in historical significance, and has been owned by some of Britain's wealthiest families.

The vast Grade-II listed Georgian home is set in beautiful countryside and includes such luxuries as an ornate music room decorated in Italian plasterwork.

But anybody who decides to take it on will have to work hard before revelling in its luxury - the house has been derelict since 2007, and is currently in such a state that it is considered dangerous.

Faded glory: Whitehall Manor in the Scottish Borders is currently on the market for just £1. But before prospective buyers start digging around behind the sofa cushion, it is so derelict it needs a £1.2m refurbishment

Former glory: The property before it fell into disrepair. It has been owned by a number of prestigious British families throughout the years

Whitehall's new owner will have to be
 committed to returning the manor to its former splendour - any 
potential buyer will have to prove that they plan to spend around 
£1.2million regenerating it.

£1 will buy:

A chicken mayo burger at McDonalds

Two second class stamps

Tights from Primark

Grade-II listed Gundimore Gables in Christchurch, Dorset, has three bedrooms and the beach by the front door

Titan has launched the world's largest television. Named Zeus, the television is eight metres by five metres, or 370 inches, which is around the size of a football goal.

Edward Seymour, head of residential sales at Edwin Thompson estate agents, said: 'It is unusual and this is quite a unique situation. The house provides a great opportunity for someone to rescue a historic building and create a wonderful home.

'I appreciate advertising the property at the low price might seem curious but we don't want people pouring money into a black hole, so we had to peg the price as low as possible.'

The wings of the house have been demolished while the main structure falls further and further into a state of disarray. The property is currently on the Buildings at Risk Register and in need of a hero.

It was 
once owned by the Hall family of Dunglass. William Hall of Whitehall, 
who died around 1749, was one of the principal clerks of the Court of 
Session - Scotland's supreme civil court.

Early in the 19th century ownership moved to Mitchell-Innes of the Ayton Castle family, who held it until the 1980s.

Since then the house and its park have passed through the hands of developers.

This
 is still far less than you would be spending on a similar sized house 
in London however - with some seven bedroom properties on sale now for 
around £40million.

Even the 
'cheaper' ones on the market cost significantly more than it would to 
buy, restore and immaculately furnish the Chirnside mansion.

A
 seven bedroom stately home in Keston which resembles the White House is
 on the market for £12million, while you can land yourself a slightly 
more modern home in Putney for upwards of £9million.

Whitehall
 is within a stone's throw of border town Berwick-upon-Tweed and just 40
 minutes from both Edinburgh and Newcastle. It is surrounded by a number
 of prestigious golf courses and close to the River Tweed - renowned for
 its salmon fishing, meaning it could make the perfect home for a 
traditional British sports enthusiast.

The
 advert on property website Rightmove states: 'The property, currently 
derelict and on the Buildings at Risk Register requires completed 
restoration and would be a significant undertaking but when complete 
would be an impressive country residence.'
