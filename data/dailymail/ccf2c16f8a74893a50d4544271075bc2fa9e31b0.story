Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy was on the receiving end of a barrage of twitter abuse over the weekend after football fans mistook him for Premier League referee Chris Foy.

Fans of Chelsea FC directed their anger at the six times Olympic champion after Foy sent off two of their players and ordered manager Jose Mourinho from the bench during their team's defeat at Aston Villa.

Despite being one of the most famous Olympic athletes in recent times, Sir Chris's twitter feed was bombarded with messages criticising his 'performance' in the match on Saturday evening.

One Twitter user called Sir Chris 'the worst referee I have ever seen', while another admitted: 'We were rubbish but Chris Hoy is a diabolical referee!'

Another user of the site meanwhile declared: 'Chris Hoy has had an absolute stinker today, awful referee.'

The mistakes were quickly picked up by others, while some even predicted Sir Chris was likely to receive abuse after being the subject of similar messages meant for Foy in the past.

Dan Walker tweeted: 'Poor old @chrishoy could be in for it tonight #FoyNotHoy #AVFC #CFC'.

Sir Chris started receiving the 
criticism after referee Foy gave two players, Willian and Ramires, as 
well as manager Mourinho, their marching orders during a fiery contest at 
Villa Park on Saturday.

It 
is not the first time the legendary cyclist has been mistaken for the 
football referee. In 2011 he was on the receiving end of insulting 
Twitter messages from Tottenham supporters who mistook him for Foy.

The referee had been in charge of Spurs' 2-1 Premier League defeat at Stoke, when the visitors had an Emmanuel Adebayor goal wrongly ruled out for offside, two penalty appeals for handball turned down and Younes Kaboul sent off.

One of those to get the pair's identities
 mixed up tweeted: 'Chris Hoy, not only are you a useless **** of a 
referee, you also support Stoke.'

Sir Chris seemed to be taking the tweets with a pinch of salt, judging by this response to a message of support from Dan Walker

Another posted: 'Robbed ! Chris hoy calls himself a premier league referee ! Â£mug.'

'Just for the record 1) I don't need glasses and 2) I do not lead a double life as an English Premier League ref. That's Chris Foy,' Sir Chris posted.

He continued rebutting the messages, adding: 'Still getting some rather amusing grief from Spurs fans! On the plus side I've learned some new 4 letter words today. #FoyNotHoy.'
