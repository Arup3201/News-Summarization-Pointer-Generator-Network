A man died after collapsing in a flat as a paramedic waited outside because she didn't think it was to safe to enter the property alone.

Anthony Offord, 35, collapsed shortly arriving at his friend's home in Sheffield in April last year and began 'coughing' on the floor. 

A Yorkshire Ambulance Service paramedic arrived at the scene five minutes later, but waited outside the building for 20 minutes until other paramedics arrived.

Anthony Offord died after a paramedic waited 20 minutes to give him care as she did not feel safe entering the property alone 

Sheffield Coroner's Court heard how Anna Bawden was sent to the flat after a 999 call was placed at around 11pm. 

The paramedic arrived moments later, but remained in her response car as it was late at night and she could hear 'shouting and agitated' men inside. 

When she phoned dispatch for support, she was told she would have to wait 16 minutes for a double crew ambulance. 

It arrived at around 11.20pm, and took Mr Offord to hospital where he died days later of lack of oxygen to the brain. 

One ambulance crew drove past the scene at 11pm, but did not attend the emergency as staff were on their meal break, the inquest heard. 

Coroner Chris Dorries said it was 'more likely than not' the man would have survived if he'd been given treatment sooner. 

Recording a narrative verdict, he said: 'I do find it more likely than not that Mr Offord would have survived if given attention at or about 23.06.

'An ambulance had been called at the time but the lone responder attending felt the need to stand off until support was available on the grounds of personal safety.

'The double crewed vehicle nominated to back up the lone responder was some distance away.

'There was a failure to consider other methods of support for the lone paramedic during that period.' 

He added he would send a report to the Health Secretary, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives and NHS England in a bid to prevent the same tragedy happening again.

Mr Offord had been living at a halfway house in Sheffield after suffering mental health problems at the time of his death. 

After struggling to cope with the recent death of his father, he began drinking and had taken heroin on the night of his death. 

He died as a result of hypoxic brain injury due to mixed drug toxicity.

Yorkshire Ambulance Service was 'under resourced' at the time of his death, it was heard. 

When Ms Bawden was sent to the address alone, she took the 'stand off' decision for the second time in her 12-year career. 

The paramedic felt uncertain about entering the property alone so late at night, and was put off by 'agitated' and 'shouting' male voices, the inquest heard. 

Call logs show another lone paramedic and a double crew ambulance could have arrived at the scene within minutes  if they had been diverted from less urgent calls.

One double ambulance crew was free at 11pm, but told to return to the station as staff were on a meal break. 

It 'must' have passed Mr Offord and the waiting paramedic on its route, Mr Dorries added. 

Describing the night in question, Shaun White, who phoned the ambulance, said it seemed like a 'lifetime' for one to arrive.

Toxicologist Dr Stephen Morley said he could not say if an ambulance had arrived earlier that Mr Offord would have survived but that 'the earlier an intervention was started the higher the probability of survival.' 

Speaking after the inquest, Mr Offord's brother said: 'Once the 999 call was made there was an ambulance delay which has significantly contributed towards Anthony’s death. 

'What we would like now is an apology from YAS which of course is something my brother will never get.

'We also intend to seek further legal advice as the family want to see a detailed timeline of what changes are going to be put in place and to know who will be responsible for implementing changes to YAS’s systems and procedures so this doesn't happen again.'

A spokesman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service said: 'Our thoughts are with Mr Offord’s family and friends following his untimely death in April last year.' 

'The Trust has fully contributed to this inquest and the Coroner was satisfied that the Trust has already addressed or is addressing the issues arising from this incident.'
