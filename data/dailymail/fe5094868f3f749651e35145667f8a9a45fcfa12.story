Manchester United want Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels but don't expect the Germans to be willing to discuss any transfer until next summer at the earliest.

Dortmund are an affluent club but have an unwritten policy of selling one major star a year and Marco Reus is anticipated to be the next to leave with a clause kicking in which allows him to go for £24million.

Reus has been injured but his departure, with Chelsea and Manchester City very much in the frame for his signature, will still prompt an irate reaction from fans.

Manchester United will wait until next summer before making a bid for Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels

Hummels is Dortmund's club captain and would help aid United's vulnerability problems in defence

That would put even more pressure on the club not to sell Germany international Hummels, who is also club captain.

United chief executive Ed Woodward was very clear in his message this week that United are not hunting short term fixes in the January window. That may yet change if injuries fail to subside but the intention is to make a play for 25-year-old Hummels in the summer.

Should Dortmund show any willingness to deal, even then United will face competition from Europe's elite clubs particularly as quality centre-backs are in such short supply.

United have been scouting defenders recently to keep on top of the market. They have watched Aleksandar Dragovic of Dynamo Kiev, Fabian Schar of Basle and Ezequiel Garay of Zenit while Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar remains a possibility as his contract runs out in the summer.

United may be forced to try and sign a player from that group should their injury crisis fail to subside.
