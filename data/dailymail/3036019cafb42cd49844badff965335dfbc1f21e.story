Two riders have been disqualified from the Vuelta a Espana after an astonishing altercation in which they traded blows from their bikes during an uphill climb.

Russian Ivan Rovny and Italian Gianluca Brambilla had been involved in an early breakaway during the pivotal 160.5km stage 16 from San Martin del Rey Aurelio to La Farrapona.

And simmering tensions reached a head as the leading group approached the climb towards San Lorenzo, about 40km from the finish, when Tinkoff Saxo rider Rovny appeared to try and put his arm around Brambilla.

Trouble brewing: Tensions that had been building right through the 16th stage came to a head when Ivan Rovny (third right in yellow) tries to put his arm round Omega Pharma Quick-Step rider Gianluca Brambilla

Lashing out: The two riders then started to exchange blows as other riders in the leading pack watched on

Still going: The pair continued to trade blows for the best part of a minute as they negotiated an uphill section with about 40km of the stage left

The Omega Pharma Quick-Step rider took exception and swung his arm back in retaliation, sparking a fist-fight as other competitors looked on in amazement.

Race officials took a dim view of the incident and disqualified both from the race just a few minutes later.

Brambilla's Omega Pharma Quick-Step team confirmed on their Twitter feed that their man had been thrown out of the race and added that Rovny had also been expelled.

Brambilla reacted with exasperation as officials broke the news to him from a safety car, raising his arms up in the air. Rovny dropped back out of the main pack when told the news.

Alberto Contador won the stage ahead of Briton Chris Froome, extending his overall lead.
