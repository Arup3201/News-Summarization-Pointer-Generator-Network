These amazing pictures show how a shed can go from being a shack at the end of the garden to a stunning summerhouse or a giant teapot.

The incredible buildings have been voted the crème-de-la-crème of the annual Shed of the Year competition, which received a record breaking 20,000 votes.

The 32 finalists have been whittled down from more than 2,000 entries and will now go head-to-head in a bid to be crowned the overall winner of the 2014 competition with a £1,000 prize courtesy of sponsors Cuprinol.

Glam: There's nothing on the inside of this colourful diner to suggests it's really a shed. The creative outhouse is down to the final 32 in the Shed of the Year competition

Rock n' roll: Anne, 45, and Ian Bate, 47, created the glitzy American style diner in tribute to her late parents who loved 50s music in their garden in St Helens, Merseyside

Entries
 include a pub which serves up to 60 people, a replica of Doctor Who’s 
time machine and a grotto made from 5,000 wine bottles.

Richard
 Pim, 73, of Pembridge, Herefordshire, came up with the idea for his 
19ft wide, 11ft high grotto while drinking red wine in his garden.

The
 retired engineer said: ‘Having finished the bottle, I held it up to the
 light of the setting sun and the sparkle made quite an impact on me.

‘We treat bottles as nothing special and chuck them in the skip but the glass is really rather beautiful and I thought it could be used in a grotto to startling effect.

‘I drink a fair bit of wine and emptied a good few of the bottles but not on the scale required, so friends donated a few too.

‘I think my wife Sally likes it well enough but she thinks I spend far too much time in the garden fiddling around making things.’

Local historian Darren Stride also decided to think big when designing his shed.

The 22-year-old, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, has not one, but six sheds in his garden dedicated to the 1940s including a Dad's Army museum.

He has reconstructed a wartime living room, kitchen and shop, which contains more than 1,000 tins.

Mr Stride said: ‘I started collecting war memorabilia aged four after my granddad gave me his Second World War medals.

‘Among my favourite possessions is an air-raid siren which I set off occasionally.

‘My neighbours are used to hearing it now.

‘I spend as much time as possible in my sheds.

Mr
 Slim, who installed a massive 119-inch screen, 3D projector and 
surround sound system, said: ‘I had all my film equipment set up in my 
living room but when my girlfriend Nic moved in she said I had to find a
 new home for it.

Father David Lifton, 45, built the ultimate bolt hole for his 12-year-old son Rhys – a Doctor Who time machine.

David used an online blueprint to build the 8ft tall box out of plywood in his back garden in Little Bentley, Essex.

He said: ‘Rhys has so many Tardis toys and I thought it would be great if he had one he could play in.

‘It is for Rhys and his mates to use when he needs to save the universe.’
