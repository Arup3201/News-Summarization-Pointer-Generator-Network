A mother was shamed into shedding six stone after her little boy likened her to the Winnie the Pooh character the heffalump.

Emma Edward, from Caterton, Oxfordshire, was devastated when her son, Logan, five, made the comparison to the plump children’s character and she vowed to do something about her 16st 3lb frame.

And she stuck to her promise. Now, after losing 6st 5lb, 32-year-old Emma weighs in at 9st 12lb and wears a size 12.

Emma said: 'I flew off the handle when Logan made the comment - I even made him cry.

'I felt so bad about it afterwards. I was taking my own feelings about being overweight out on him. He was only four at the time, he didn’t mean anything by it.

'But it gave me the motivation to do something about my weight. I’d been meaning to for so long, but I just couldn’t stick with a diet plan.

'It’s great to be able to do things with my kids now, and I no longer get out of breath just walking up the stairs.'

The ex-RAF engineer piled on weight when she was working in the air force and her weight crept up to 16st 3lb

Emma followed a weight plan, which involves replacing food with soups and milkshakes to rebuild the relationship with food - she even won an award for her efforts

Emma had been overweight for as long as she could remember. She originally lost weight to join the RAF as an engineer in 1999.

But during her time in the air force, the weight crept back on and shortly after Emma had her children, Logan and Niamh, seven, she reached her peak weight of 16st 3lb.

Emma said: 'It fluctuated while I tried different diets, but I could never find anything I could stick to. In the end I saw a story in the newspaper about a lady that had lost loads of weight on the Cambridge Weight Plan.

Thanks to her new diet, Emma has lost 6st 5lb. She won the Family Spirit award at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards last year

'I rushed home to find out more and signed straight up. If I hadn’t done it there and then I never would have got round to it.

'In the first week I lost seven pounds, and the weight kept coming off.'

The weight plan involves replacing food with soups and milkshakes to rebuild the relationship with what you're eating.

Thanks to her new diet, Emma has lost 6st 5lb. She won the Family Spirit award at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards last year.

Not only was the slimmer keen to shed the extra weight, she was also determined to teach her children about a healthy, balanced lifestyle.

She explained: 'I didn’t want my kids to see stick thin as healthy, but I didn’t want them to see overweight as healthy either.

'Before I went on the plan we sat and looked at lots of pictures of people and I got them to say who was healthy and who wasn’t, then I asked if they thought I was healthy.

'We never called it a diet, only "mummy’s healthy eating plan".'
