Princess Diana looks her usual serene self in this previously unseen portrait, and only a second glance reveals that all is not what it appears to be.

The artist who produced one of the late Princess’s favourite portraits in 1990 has created an updated version which imagines how she would look now at the age of 52 – and a granny.

Israel Zohar, 68, says: ‘I didn’t want to make her look too old because I don’t think she would have aged that much.’

Zohar recalls a Diana who was totally lacking in confidence when he first painted her.

He said: ‘It was funny because I had to keep reassuring her how attractive she was.’

Zohar had only come to the UK two years earlier when he was commissioned for Diana's portrait.

His work had been spotted at his first exhibition in England held at a Mayfair gallery by an officer of the 13th/18th Royal Hussars.

The regiment wanted a portrait of its colonel in chief to hang at its headquarters.

Mr Zohar expected to have to paint an old man with a moustache, but was shocked when he discovered his subject was Diana.

He worked painstakingly day and night to create his masterpiece during sittings with the Princess at Kensington Palace and at his studio in nearby South Kensington.

The princess wore the famous midnight blue Victor Edelstein gown that she wore on a visit to the White House five years earlier when she danced with John Travolta.

The dress sold for £510,000 back in 2011.

Although she is wearing the same dress as the original in the updated version, this time Diana is standing rather than sitting.
