Authorities have surveillance footage showing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez at a club with two men who were shot dead hours later, law enforcement sources have revealed.

Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, were killed in a drive-by shooting on July 15, 2012 after they left the club in south Boston - in a murder that remains unsolved.

The former New England Patriots tight end has not been charged in the case, but he has been the main focus after investigators said he was at the same nightclub as the men before the shooting.

He is awaiting a trial in Massachusetts for the June murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, 27. It was reported in June that Lloyd could 
have known about Hernandez's alleged involvement in the 2012 double 
murder and Hernandez reportedly killed him to keep him quiet.

Connection? Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in June, was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012

'The motive might have been that the 
victim (Lloyd) knew (Hernandez) might have been involved,' unidentified 
police officials told The Boston Globe at the time.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to shooting dead Lloyd, whose body was found near the sport star's home in a Boston suburb.

Hernandez was released by the New England Patriots when he was implicated in the killing and has been jailed without bail since his arrest in June.

The 2012 shooting took place after a fight broke out inside Cure, a South End nightclub. It was reported that Abreu and Furtado got into an argument with a group that included Hernandez.

Seized: Police took an SUV similar to one seen at the scene from Hernandez's uncle's house

CTNow reported on Tuesday that multiple sources had claimed authorities had footage of the football player and the victims at the same nightclub.

As Abreu drove away from the club in his BMW with Furtado in the passenger's seat, a silver or grey SUV with Rhode Island license plates pulled up to the car and started shooting.

There were other men in the BMW who all survived the attack but both Furtado and Abreu died.

The exact motive behind the killings of the two friends, who worked together for a cleaning company, is not known. The men did not know Hernandez, their relatives have said.

The case is now being heard by a grand jury to determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges.

Arrest: The gun allegedly used to shoot the two men was found in the trunk of a car driven by Jailene Diaz-Ramos, pictured. She said she was giving a ride to footballer friends who must have left it there

After searching Hernandez's uncle's 
home, investigators allegedly found a silver SUV rented in the 
footballer's name that roughly matched the description of the one seen 
at the scene, the Hartford Courant reported.

The vehicle, which had been parked in the garage for about year, was seized by Boston authorities.

They made a connection between Hernandez and the double homicide after the former NFL star fell in the spotlight for Lloyd's killing, The Boston Globe reported.

In another twist, police found the handgun used in the double murder in the trunk of a 19-year-old woman's car after she crashed near Springfield, Massachusetts in June.

The Massachusetts State Police sent the weapon in for ballistics testing and learned that it fired the rounds that killed Abreu and Furtado.

Accused: Hernandez is now facing trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd, right, who was found dead in June

The woman, Jailene Diaz-Ramos, who is from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, reportedly said she was giving her friends - who were football players - a ride to work and that they must have left it in her car.

Diaz-Ramos faces three illegal firearms charges.

Hernandez, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in August, is set to appear in court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Friday.
