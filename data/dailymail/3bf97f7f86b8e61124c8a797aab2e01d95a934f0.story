Football fans excited about the World Cup final on Sunday are preparing to travel to Germany in their droves – with searches for flights soaring.

Thousands of Brits are expected to head overseas to join in the atmosphere as Germany takes on Argentina for the third time in a World Cup.

Skyscanner has reported a 293 per cent increase in the number of UK searches to Germany for travel this weekend, following the country’s win against Brazil on Tuesday night.

The demand is twice as high as the number of searches made for flights to New Zealand on the first day of the Duke and Duchess's of Cambridge royal tour in April – which were up by 153 per cent.

Today's data is based on searches from all UK airports to all airports in Germany on July 9th for travel on 11th to 13th July, compared to searches the previous week.

Spokesman Mary Porter called it a ‘significant’ increase.

She added: ‘It shows that despite England’s early exist from the tournament, fans are still keen to enjoy the action.

‘And with such a short flight time, cheap regional flights and great beer where better for them to celebrate the final than in Germany? 

‘It looks like the Brits will not be alone however, with nearby nations Spain, Switzerland, Norway and Italy all seeing huge increases for flights to Germany this weekend too.’
