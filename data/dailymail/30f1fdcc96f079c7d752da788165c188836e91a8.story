Simon Christen, from Oakland, CA, has created a mesmerising time-lapse  video capturing the fog in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The footage titled Adrift captures the ridges of the California coast and the iconic Golden Gate Bridge.

The fog looks like water flows like a river, gently lapping across the landscape, enveloping the early morning scene.

Mr Christen, a character animator at Pixar Animation Studios, dedicated two years to creating the film in his spare time.

He monitored the weather conditions to check they would be right 'just right for the fog to glide over the hills and under the bridge.'

His work became his life and multiple times a day he would check the weather forecast, 
satellite images and webcams.

If he felt they would be suitable he would set his alarm clock at 5pm and drive 45-minutes to the Marin Headlands.

'I spent many mornings hiking in the dark
to only find that the fog was too high, too low, or already gone by the
time I got there. Luckily, once in a while the conditions would be 
perfect and I was able to capture something really special.

'Adrift is a 
collection of my favorite shots from these excursions into the ridges of
the Marin Headlands.'
