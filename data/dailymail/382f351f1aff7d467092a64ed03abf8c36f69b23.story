A New York delivery man was been awarded almost $1 million in damages by a jury after detailing the anti-Semitic torment he suffered by three supervisors in the workplace.

Adam Weircinski, who is in his fifties and lives in Washington Heights, won $900,000 and a 'moral victory' following years of abuse at Midtown Manhattan restaurant Mangia 57.

The Brooklyn federal court was told how other employees would call him a 'dirty Jew'.

Nightshift manager Artur Zbozien was named in the lawsuit as someone who would 'pass gas' in front of Wiercinski and 'joke' that is was Zyklon B, the poison used in Nazi gas chambers during the Holocaust.

'My father had six siblings — only two of them survived in what is now the Ukraine,' he told Fox News.

'I had to explain to the members of the jury what is Zyklon B.

Adam Wiercinski, a longtime delivery man at upscale caterer Mangia says he suffered years of torment from his bosses because he's Jewish.  Wiercinski says he was repeatedly derided as "a stinking Jew" and "dirty Jew" by his bosxes and co-workers.  Wiercinski is shown here in front of Mangia located at 50 West 57th Street in Manhattan. He has won $900,000 in damages

'Because they were very young; they do not know.

'When I explain how it was used in the gas chambers, they were very serious.

'Everybody [in the courtroom] was silent.'

Other supervisors would dock Wiercinski’s tips, call him a 'Jewish pederast', 'stupid' and throw pennies at him.

Wiercinski worked at the W. 57 St. restaurant from 1992 until 2008.

His lawyer, Matthew Blit, said he stayed despite the abuse because of his age.

'Who else is going to hire a 50-year-old delivery man? He was afraid,' Mr Blit said.

'He's in shock (at the result).

Adam Wiercinski was a delivery man for Mangia, in Midtown, Manhattan, from 1992 until 2008

'He was so happy.

'It's a moral victory for him.'

Jurors heard the testimony over three days last week.

Wiercinski's accounts were supported by other co-workers.

Most of the testimony was in Polish.

The jury made a decision in just four hours.

Employees at the restaurant and caterer, which has three Manhattan locations, have denied the harassment took place.

The restaurant is expected to seek that the verdict be tossed out or reduced.
