While the fact that going on holiday makes us happier is hardly breaking news, the sacrifices we would make for an extra week in the sun make for much more interesting reading.

Research has revealed that reveals that 69 per cent of British employees cite regular holidays as helping them keep focused in the workplace which is vital as we approach arguably some of the most miserable working days of the year this January.

In fact, such is the clamour for holiday time, one in three Brits would take a pay cut for more holiday and 61 per cent said they'd even switch jobs.

When it comes to inducing general happiness, being on holiday tops the list for Brits (46 per cent), beating getting a tax refund, finding lost money and being told you look younger. 

1. Being on holiday – 46%2 

2. Getting a tax refund – 17%3

3. Finding lost money – 14%

4. Being told you look younger than you are – 9%

5. Birthdays – 8% 

A healthy 94 per cent of us also associate holidays with their overall happiness, with 89 per cent saying they come back from holidays happier than before they left. 

Junk food tops the list of things Britons would be happy to sacrifice in order to get an extra week's holiday; 50 per cent admitted to being prepared to cut out the crisps and chocolate for more time in the sun.

But catching the eye more is that 28 per cent of people admit they would give up sex if it meant more time away from work. And, worryingly, 16 per cent would forgo having a shower for more time off.

Relative to other markets, however, British bosses show one highest levels of support for holidays globally.

According to the report 69 per cent of British employees feel supported by their boss when taking their holiday allocation, in comparison to only 28 per cent in neighbouring France and a global average of just 55 per cent.

'While habits differ across continents, the emotional impact of holiday does not,' said Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, who conducted the research.

'Almost 70 per cent of British employees say that holidays make them feel more focused at work, as well as happier, better rested and less stressed. 

'In the UK, we're fortunate to have one of the highest holiday allowances and the most supportive bosses globally, so, we are in a great position to use up any days we've rolled over from last year - or still remaining - is a great way to start the New Year on a high and banish the post-Christmas blues,'
