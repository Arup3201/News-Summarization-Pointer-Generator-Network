Betty Teague, 85, of Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, has been banned for a year for drink-driving

Pensioner Betty Teague is believed to be the oldest female drink driver in the country after she was banned from the roads for a year.

Teague, 85, of Shoreham, East Sussex, was pulled over by police officers who found her driving slowly along the A27 with no lights on April 3.

She failed a breath test which revealed she had 100 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - above the legal limit of 80.

Teague pleaded guilty to drink-driving at Brighton Magistrates Court.

She was fined £73, ordered to pay victim surcharge of £20, court costs of £85, as well as being banned from driving for a year.

She told the MailOnline: 'I have been driving for years.

'Yes I've been banned for a year. It is a shame. I love driving.

'I've never had to go to court before.'

Superintendent Jane Derrick said the case proved that there was no such thing as a 'typical drink-driver'.

She
 said: 'We are catching people of all ages, of both sexes and of a range
 of backgrounds and occupations who think it is okay to risk their lives 
and the lives of other road users by having a drink and then getting 
behind the wheel.

'Teague 
could have easily caused an accident by the way she was driving but 
luckily we were able to stop her before that could happen and she is now
 banned from the roads for the next year.

'It is totally unacceptable to drink and drive. As far as we are concerned, one drink is one drink too many.'

David Bye is believed to have been Britain's oldest drink-driver at the age of 88.

Bye
 failed a breath test after an off duty police officer saw him driving 
his grey Skoda erratically on the A14 near Felixstowe, Suffolk, last 
year.

Bye of Ipswich admitted drink-driving and was given a 12 month driving ban.

He was also fined £140 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.
