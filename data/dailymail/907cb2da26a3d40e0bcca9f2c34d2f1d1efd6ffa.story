An escaped murderer who had been jailed for life for killing a British couple on their Caribbean honeymoon has died after being shot by police.

Avie Howell, 24, who shot Welsh newlyweds Ben and Catherine Mullany in 2008, was caught in a rural parish just south of the capital, St John's, before a 'confrontation' broke out.

He was shot in the knees and died in hospital three hours after climbing over a 30ft-wall at the holiday island's prison.

He had been on the run since yesterday after he and his cellmate, who was 
on fraud charges, had cut through a wire fence and scaled the perimeter.

Howell and accomplice Kaniel Martin, 27, were
 convicted of killing the couple in 2011, who had only been married for two weeks.

They had burst into Mr and Mrs Mullany's chalet at the Cocos Hotel in a dawn raid in July 2008.

The
 newlyweds, who lived in Rhos, near Pontardawe, were both shot in the 
head while their killers made off with their mobile phones, a cheap 
digital camera and a handful of cash.

Corporal
 Thomas said: 'This morning, the police acting on a tip-off on 
information they had received regarding his his whereabouts went to that
 area where a confrontation took place between him and the police which 
resulted in him being shot.

'He was rushed to hospital and roughly at about midday, he was pronounced dead.'

The couple, who were both 31, had only been married a little over a fortnight when they were shot.

Mrs
 Mullany, a hospital doctor, died instantly, while her trainee 
physiotherapist husband, was flown home to Swansea in a coma. Despite 
the best efforts of his wife's medical colleagues he died a week after 
the shooting.

It meant that 
just five weeks after happily celebrating their wedding at St John The 
Evangelist Church in Cilybebyll, their grief-stricken parents were 
attending the couple's funeral.

Then
 three years to the day after the deaths, Howell and Martin were found 
guilty of murdering the honeymoon couple as well as shooting 43-year-old
 local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson.

The
 pair had yet to stand trial for the 2008 alleged murders of Rafique 
Harris and Tony Louisa. Those two killings happened just a few weeks 
after Mr and Mrs Mullany were shot.

In
 the wake of the murders, the couple's family set up the Mullany Fund - 
which saw Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson and Antiguan cricket legend Sir
 Vivian Richards become patrons.

The charity aims to carry on the good work started by the couple by giving grants to medical students.

Happy together: The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape

Three years to the day after the deaths, Howell and Martin were found guilty of murdering the honeymoon couple as well as shooting 43-year-old local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson.

The killers were both jailed for life.

Friends of Ben and Catherine Mullany say they were 'destined to be together'.

But tragically within a month of celebrating their wedding, they were buried alongside each other at the church where they were married.

The eldest child of Cynlais and Marilyn Mullany, Benjamin Mullany grew up in the Swansea Valley village of Ystalyfera along with younger brother Adam.

He was a talented rugby player and part of the Cwmtawe Comprehensive School team, which won the Wales school championship in 1993.

Nicknamed by pals as 'Muscles Mullany', Mr Mullany also served in the Army and was shot while deployed in Northern Ireland.

He also worked for a while as a police officer in Sheffield, but left after finding elements of the job - such as breaking bad news to relatives of people who had died - as 'too distressing'.

They met by chance in a pub close to their home villages. Despite growing up a few miles from each other, their paths did not cross until they were in their late 20s.

In 2006, he enrolled at the University of West England, Bristol, to study an undergraduate degree in physiotherapy.

During his studies, Mr Mullany went on a work placement scheme with professional rugby team The Scarlets, in Llanelli.

Last year Howell was handed an additional four-year sentence for a burglary he carried out just weeks before murdering Mr and Mrs Mullany.

The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape.

They were also concerned that Howell might flee the island.

A source said: 'You would have thought they would have kept him under lock and key.'

Following the verdicts, which came three years after the killings, Mr Mullany’s parents, Cynlais and Marilyn, and his wife’s mother and father, Rachel and David Bowen, broke down in tears.

In a joint statement, they said at the time: ‘There is no joy at today’s verdict, just a sense of relief that after three years of waiting there is justice for our children.

‘These two individuals can never again inflict the same anguish and devastation to any other family as they have to ours.

'We will never be able to comprehend the senseless nature of their deaths, the total disregard shown for human life and that no remorse has ever been shown.

'Ben and Cath will live in our hearts forever. They made our lives happy beyond measure and enriched every day that they were with us.'

The Honeymoon Killings, as they became known, shocked the tiny nation of Antigua, which had touted itself as a safe tropical honeymoon destination.

The Mullanys’ stay at the five-star Cocos resort had been a wedding present from friends and family.

Guests described hearing screams from their cottage on July 27, 2008, before gunshots.

Martin and Howell, who had been enjoying Antigua’s carnival celebrations hours before, seemingly targeted their cabin at random.

The gunmen, who refused to face questioning in court, protested their innocence throughout the trial. Their silence means the motive remaines unclear.

They were snared after SIM cards registered to them were activated in Mr Mullany’s stolen phone within hours of the shootings.
