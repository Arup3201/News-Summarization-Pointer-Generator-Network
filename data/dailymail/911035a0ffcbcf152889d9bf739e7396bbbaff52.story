Rebekah Brooks, the former tabloid editor who faces trial later this year, soaks up the sun in Australia on a luxury yacht with her husband Charlie.

The couple, guests of Rupert Murdoch’s son Lachlan and his wife Sarah, cruised round Sydney Harbour.

Mrs Brooks, 44, looked pale but relaxed as she sipped beer and enjoyed a meal on the boat with her companions.

Away from it all: Sarah Murdoch and husband Lachlan are joined by Rebekah and Charlie Brooks, and their children, for a cruise around Sydney Harbour

Tough year ahead: Rebekah and Charlie Brooks managed to look relaxed while they paddled in a dinghy despite the forthcoming trial

Both couples and their children took a
 four-hour trip aboard the 70ft Aquabay. Mr and Mrs Brooks also went out
 in a dinghy for a paddle.

Brooks edited the News of the World from 
2000 to 2003 before moving to edit The Sun and then becoming chief 
executive officer of the two papers’ parent group News International.

She will appear in court 
later this year over alleged illegal payments to public officials.

In a separate case, she and Mr Brooks, 50, from Churchill, Oxfordshire, are accused of perverting the course of justice.

Almost 200 Scotland Yard detectives are working on the three investigations linked to phone hacking.

Rarely seen: Lachlan Murdoch and his wife Sarah O'Hare  joined the cruise

In court: Brooks, 44, ex-editor of The Sun and News of the World, and David Cameron’s former spin doctor 
Coulson will  face trial in September next year

Trial: Coulson will stand trial alongside former newspaper editor Rebekah Brooks, pictured leaving the Old Bailey last year
