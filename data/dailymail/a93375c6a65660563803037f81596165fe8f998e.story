It's the little things that really make a difference to Britons' happiness, according to a new survey.

And results show it's small perks, like the extra hour in bed we'll all got today, that make 93 per cent of us happy.

Topping the list  is receiving a compliment, with more than two thirds (68 per cent) of Britons saying a kind word is the best pick-me-up to their week.  

More than two thirds of Britons (66 per cent) are planning a guiltless lie-in on 

This is closely followed by receiving an unexpected gift (65 per cent) and sunny days (59 per cent). 

More than a third (36 per cent) of Britons count having a lie in as one of the little things that make them happy, with more ladies (40 per cent) than men (31 per cent) looking forward to some extra shut-eye.

In fact, more than two thirds of Britons (66 per cent) enjoyed a guiltless lie-in today.

Almost a quarter (23 per cent) agreed that it's the ability of the unexpected little gesture or treat to brighten their day that makes them special - giving us a break from the humdrum of daily life. 

And us Britons are kinder than we realise - one in five claim to get one little pick-me-up a day (21 per cent), while for a quarter (25 per cent), the last time they received a small gesture was just a week ago.

Furthermore, women are much more responsive to the little things, as opposed to grand gestures. 

Climbing into fresh sheets is a real treat for 65 per cent of women

Climbing into fresh sheets is a real treat for 65 per cent of women, compared to 42 per cent men. Not surprisingly, the one small thing men get more excited about than women is having an alcoholic beverage with almost half of males (40 per cent) admitting this cheers them up versus just 29 per cent of women. 

The research also revealed the happiest region is Edinburgh and incidentally its residents are also the ones most looking forward to a lie-in when the clocks go back this weekend (74 per cent).  

The least happy city in the UK is Newcastle, where only 14 per cent benefit from a little gesture from a friend of loved one every day. 

Almost half the nation (48 per cent) wish they had more time in the day, despite one in three admitting they'll be doing nothing at all with the extra hour over the weekend (37 per cent). 

However, when asked what they could do with an extra hour in the day, a quarter would exercise (25 per cent) and worryingly, more people would choose to spend more time with friends (21 per cent) than family (18 per cent), with only 6 per cent admitting they'd play with their kids.

A spokesperson for multi-channel store QVC, which commissioned the research, said: 'It's interesting to see that it's is the small things which really count and that an unexpected gift is one of the things most likely to make someone happy. If you're looking to bring a smile to someone's face, QVC has a range of "little things" to suit all tastes.'
