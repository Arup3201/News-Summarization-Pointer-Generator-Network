Superfluous: The new reforms to stamp duty 'has made Miliband's mansion tax redundant'

Labour's flagship mansion tax policy has been rendered effectively redundant by George Osborne’s recent stamp duty reforms, a report claims.

Ed Miliband would impose an annual tax of thousands of pounds on people living in homes worth more than £2million to raise an estimated £1.2billion a year.

But the Chancellor’s reforms have already increased the tax burden on high value homes by £1.1billion a year and mean the top 1.6 per cent of households – with homes worth more than £1million – now pay 45 per cent of all stamp duty, the Centre for Policy Studies says.

The think-tank claims any further taxation on high-value property owners would be ‘difficult to justify on grounds of fairness’. 

Its study says ‘any justification for a mansion tax has been significantly eroded’ by recent stamp duty increases on high-value properties. 

While the reforms mean the majority of buyers save money, those purchasing homes costing more than £937,500 will pay a higher tax bill.

The maximum stamp duty charge, levied on homes costing more than £1.5million, is now 12 per cent compared to 7 per cent previously.

Separate changes have closed a loophole which allowed people to avoid paying stamp duty on an expensive home by purchasing it through a company, rather than as an individual.

The report said these two changes meant the top 1.6 per cent of households pay almost half of all stamp duty collected by the taxman.

It said Labour’s mansion tax proposal was crude, would take no account of an individual’s ability to pay, would be expensive to administer and would raise insignificant revenues. 

Labour’s £1.2billion a year estimate is equivalent to less than one-quarter of 1 per cent of current tax revenues.

The think-tank warned that the tax would seriously undermine the attraction of investing in the UK to rich overseas buyers, risking a ‘wider economic impact’.

It also claimed the tax would suppress property values at the top end of the market, diminishing tax receipts for inheritance tax and stamp duty. At least £1 in every £6 raised by a mansion tax would be lost this way, it said. Tim Knox, of the Centre for Policy Studies, said a mansion tax was ‘unfair, complex, uncertain and inefficient’.

He said: ‘Ultimately, the proposed mansion tax is little more than an appeal to envy’, adding that it would drive ‘cash poor, asset rich, households to sell their houses’.

Property lawyer Tom Moran, at Charles Russell Speechlys, said it would hit the middle classes. He said: ‘A mansion tax, by itself, is unlikely to faze wealthy international buyers and ultra-high net worths buying in London and across the UK.

‘It is actually a levy on the capital’s middle classes, particularly baby boomers who bought big cheap houses until the 1990s. Many of these cash poor but asset rich older people will sell up and downsize.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said people in homes worth £2million to £3million would pay £3,000 a year in mansion tax, with the charge for properties worth more than that being revealed after the election. Economists claim that it could average £24,000 a year.

Some Labour MPs have publicly criticised the plans and party grandee Lord Mandelson has said it would end up ‘clobbering’ people.

But last night Labour said a mansion tax would help pay for 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives. Those who could not afford the tax upfront could have it rolled up and paid from their estate after their death.
