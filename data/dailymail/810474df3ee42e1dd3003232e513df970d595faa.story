Banned: David Bradley, 55, cannot teach for at least two years after he 
admitted streaking across a field with a group of year 8 pupils (file picture)

A grammar school teacher who streaked naked in front of his pupils has been banned from Britain's classrooms for at least two years.

Education Secretary Michael Gove imposed the sanction on David Bradley, 59, after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at North Cestrian Grammar School, in Altrincham, Cheshire.

Bradley, who received an MBE four years 
ago for his work with children on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, quit his job last month after admitting it had been 
‘inappropriate’ to streak.

He had been camping with the group of 12-and 13-year-olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden.

The married teacher told a disciplinary panel: ‘The lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying, “Come on sir, you have a go.”

‘At that point, for whatever reason, I got up, ran down the garden and ran back in. Even when I did it I thought, “What am I doing?”’

The Teaching Agency, who announced the ban today said: 'We are satisfied on the evidence that he took the conscious decision to agree to streak, then moved out of his sleeping bag, removed his boxer shorts and then ran with pupils in the garden.

Bradley said that he could not explain why he had behaved in that way, but claimed that in November 2011 he was close to a breakdown due to stress and the pressure of work.

Their report went on: 'Mr Bradley confirmed that there were no complaints raised by any children, and the children had found it hilarious.'

Recommending he should be struck off the disciplinary panel said: 'Teachers are expected to behave in a manner which ensures the maintenance of appropriate professional boundaries.

'We believe that your actions in engaging in the streak failed to maintain the clear boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour which should exist between pupils and teachers. Your behaviour failed to ensure the maintenance of appropriate boundaries which are essential in order to ensure that a teacher's position of trust, responsibility and authority are upheld.'

Bradley had undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the Solwaybank centre in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011.

The veteran teacher, from Hale Barns in Greater Manchester, was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he taught.

However, the Teaching Agency hearing in Coventry ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl, who Bradley said was hypothermic, did not amount to misconduct.

Respected: Four years ago Mr Bradley was handed an MBE but has now left North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham in disgrace after the school trip

The English master was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services 
to young people after running schemes for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award 
for 30 years.

He said at the time that organising 
trips was ‘normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal 
vitality the young exude’.

Bradley, who has taught for 37 years, said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional.

However, referring to the accusations
about hugging the girl,  Bradley said he was ‘aghast’ that what used to
be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints.

‘The thing that comes out of this is how out of date I am,’ he said.

‘What is viewed as normal today seems
to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult can’t be near to
a child without being accused of something. I’m aghast.’
