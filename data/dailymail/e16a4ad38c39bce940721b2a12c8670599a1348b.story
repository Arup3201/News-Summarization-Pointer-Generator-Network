The actor who voiced Charlie Brown in classic cartoon Peanuts has been sentenced to jail for stalking and making death threats to a former girlfriend and her plastic surgeon.

Peter Robbins, 56, was handed a 12-month jail term and five years on probation followed by a stern Peanuts-related warning from the judge to ‘not be a blockhead’.

The former voice actor was arrested in January for stalking his former partner, allegedly calling her as many as 37 times in 24 hours, telling her he would kill her and her son.

You're jailed, Charlie Brown: Peter Robbins was sentenced to a year in jail for threatening his former girlfriend and stalking her plastic surgeon

Robbins, who famously gave voice to Charlie Brown’s screams of frustration in the 1960s television show, also stalked his former girlfriend’s plastic surgeon, blaming the breast enlargement she performed on his ex for their breakup.

Sentencing him to one year in county jail and five years on probation, a San Diego judge borrowed a line from Peanuts to warn Robbins of the consequences of violating his terms.

‘If I can borrow a line from 'Peanuts,' sir, I'm going to grant probation. If you adhere to those terms, you won’t go to prison. So, don’t be a blockhead.’

Robbins was arrested on the Mexican border in January, accused of threatening and stalking Shawna Kern following their breakup.

Ms Kern said Robbins would constantly call her and make threats to kill her and her child if she did not return Robbins’ car and dog.

Not exactly Peanuts: As well as the one year sentence, the former Charlie Brown voice actor was given five years on probation and was told by the judge 'not to be a blockhead' to avoid further jailtime

During his April trial, prosecutors 
said Robbins threatened plastic surgeon Lori Saltz after she performed a
breast enhancement surgery on Ms Kern, paid for by Robbins.

Robbins and Ms Kern broke up after the surgery and Robbins began stalking Ms Saltz, demanding a refund.

Prosecutors
said Robbins was calling Ms Saltz’s Carlsbad clinic so many times she 
moved to a hotel temporarily out of fear for her life and hired an armed
guard outside her clinic.

The
court also heard Robbins confronted his former girlfriend in a hotel 
room on New Year’s Eve, beating his dog and telling her he would not 
stop hurting the animal and would kill her if she did not get a refund 
for the surgery.

He then grabbed his ex-girlfriend by the neck and shoved her against the door before fleeing.

I'm sorry: Peter Robbins reads out a statement where he expressed regret and apologised for the pain caused to his two victims

Robbins pleaded guilty to  two counts of stalking and ten counts of making criminal threats in April, and openly cried in court as his sentence was handed down.

Robbins, famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark 'AAUGH!' screams of frustration in the 1960s, managed a smile through the tears as the judge delivered the Peanuts jibe.

The San Diego judge warned him not to be a ‘blockhead’ – a reference to the cheeky insult often thrown at his character Charlie Brown.

Prior to his arrest Robbins had spoken out against the forthcoming Peanuts movie, calling it pointless and a 'horrible idea'.

He accused 20th Century Fox of 
lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original 
televised version of the popular cartoon.

As a child actor, Robbins became famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark screams of frustration in A Charlie Brown Christmas (above) and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown

Speaking in October last year, Robbins said: 'What's the point?

'If it's to reintroduce the character 
of Charlie Brown to a new generation, it's been passed on successfully 
for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.'

The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries.

Following yesterday's sentencing, 
Robbins read a statement to the court where he said he had ‘no ill will’
towards his victims and apologised for the pain he caused them.

I’ve
taken responsibility for my actions and will openly seek treatment for 
my alcoholism and prescription medication addictions.’

 I
realize this is just the first step toward becoming the fun-loving, 
respectful person I was and hope to become again,’ Robbins said.

As
well as serving jail time and probation, Robbins was ordered to enrol 
in a drug treatment program and pay $15,000 in restitution to Lori 
Saltz.
