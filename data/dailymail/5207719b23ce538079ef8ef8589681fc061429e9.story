Wedding photos are obviously very special to any couple when remembering their big day but usually, after the initial excitement dies down, most people get a tad fed up if you keep sharing them enthusiastically.

But it seems the internet can't get enough of one couple's nuptial shots after they went viral following their spontaneous descision to hold the ceremony in Iceland after wedding planning became too hectic.

The American couple, Josh and Sarah Walk, both 20, had originally planned to hold their wedding ceremony in Waynesville, Ohio but swapped their location to Reykjavik, Iceland where they were due to have their honeymoon, resulting in some spectacular weddings shots.

The couple were captured in their full 
wedding outfits in front of stunning waterfalls and incredible mountain 
ranges over a two-day period.

The couple posted their beautiful wedding snaps on Facebook the day after the ceremony, June 6 and immediately saw a phenomenal response with the collection of images going viral and shared across the world.

The photographer who captured the breathtaking images was Gabe McClintock, from Calgary in Alberta, Canda. He caught Sarah's eye whilst she was browsing the Internet and says she knew immediately that there was no one else for the job.

'I'd seen Gabe's blog and the photographs were like nothing I had ever seen before - he had to shoot the wedding' said Sarah.

The bride continued to say that Iceland provided the perfect backdrop for the awe-inspiring photographs.

'When we arrived in Iceland we fell in love at first sight. It's the most awe-inspiring location we could have imagined - there are no words to describe the grandeur and untouched beauty.

'When we got to see the photographs they were beyond anything we had hoped for and we can't wait to display them in our home for decades to come.'

Josh Walk added that he had never anticipated such a huge response to the photographs but was thrilled to have shared his experience with the world.

'We are so grateful for the opportunity to share our love and memories from that time with others' said the groom.

'I never expected the photos to go viral, so to have that happen has been such an amazing experience.'
