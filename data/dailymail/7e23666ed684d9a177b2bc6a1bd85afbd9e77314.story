Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop has flagged a possible end to the Budget impasse by declaring the Coalition Government should be prepared to compromise on key measures which are blocking its move through a hostile Senate. 

The Abbott administration has struggled to win the necessary support since it was delivered by Joe Hockey back in May and senior ministers have begun sending strong signals that 'adjustments' will be made.

However, Julie Bishop would not go as far as detailing what those changes could be.

Deputy Liberal Leader and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes compromising with all the other parties can get the contentious Budget through the Senate

'In negotiations with the Senate, including Labor, the Greens and the cross-benchers, if they've got constructive suggestions, we should consider them,' she told ABC radio.

Among the biggest stumbling blocks have been the proposed $7 GP co-payment, family benefit changes and university reforms.

'That's what negotiations should be; finding constructive ways to work together to achieve the over-riding necessity of fixing the budget line,' Ms Bishop added.

A tough sell. Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and his Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) have been urged by Coalition colleagues to water down the Budget to try and convince a hostile Senate 

The Budget proved so unpopular that Tony Abbott's standing as preferred prime minister dropped to historic low levels immediately after it was unveiled, along with a battering to the Coalition's primary and two-party preferred support.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who was the other man spotted by cameras enjoying cigars with Joe Hockey after the budget was delivered, agrees with a growing number of disgruntled Coalition colleagues.

Where there's smoke there's ire. Back in May, Treasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister rejoiced in the Budget delivery with cigars but a hostile Senate has cut short those celebrations

'We are realists. We do know that the Liberal National parties only have 33 senators in the Australian Senate,' he told the ABC.

'We need six cross-bench senators or others to join with us to pass legislation in the Senate.

'It was always obvious there would have to be an adjustment here, an adjustment there, if we wanted to get some of those budget measures through the Parliament.'

Health Minister Peter Dutton has indicated one of the most contentious reforms, to establish a $7 GP co-payment, could be altered.

He believes talks with the cross-benchers have been 'productive'.

'I'm hopeful that the Government can do a deal in relation to the GP co-payment, because there's certainly a lot of optimism from the senators - that's my assessment,' he told ABC NewsRadio.

Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon (right) has all but dashed the hopes of senior government ministers like Peter Dutton (Minister for Health) that there's reason for optimism the Budget will get through with 'amendments' only. The Senator says only 'major change' will win his support

For all the optimism from Coalition ranks that adjustments could win the necessary support, a few words of warning have been delivered by key Independent Senator Nick Xenophon.

In fact, he has made it clear that only major changes will win his backing.

'When the government talks about an adjustment here, an adjustment there, it reminds me of going to the chiropractor - whereas, in fact, I think this budget needs some general anaesthetic and some radical surgery,' he told AM.
