A Maine teenager suffered second-degree burns on Friday when her iPhone caught fire in her pocket while she was at school.

The girl, who has not been named, was burned on the thigh and back when her iPhone 5C started smouldering in her back pocket.

Classmates heard a pop and saw smoke billowing around the 14-year-old, who had to remove her pants in class to get away from the fire.

The girl, who has not been named, had just arrived for her French class at a Kennebunk middle school.

'She knew right away something was wrong and, in a panic, knew her pants were on fire caused by the cell phone,' principal Jeff Rodman told the Morning Sentinel.

A group of girls gathered around the student and helped remove her clothes, while boys who were in the class were ushered outside.

'It was sensitive. She knew she was kind of in a tough situation,' Mr Rodman said.

The girl's mother, Judy Milligan, had given her daughter the green iPhone 5C two months ago.

Shock: Judy Milligan says her daughter was calm and asked to return to school after being treated for burns

Mrs Milligan said she was shocked when the school called to tell her what happened, but said her daughter had remained calm and even asked to go back to school after being treated in hospital.

There have been a few reported cases of iPhones catching fire or overheating while they charged.

It is not known what caused the schoolgirl's phone to overheat.
