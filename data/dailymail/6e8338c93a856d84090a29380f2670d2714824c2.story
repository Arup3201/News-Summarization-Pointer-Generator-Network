Members of a persecuted Iraqi sect have been faced with the grim task of sifting through a mass grave to try to identify missing loved ones they fear were killed by the Islamic State.

Kurdish forces found the remains of about 25 men, women and children of the Yazidi minority  in a trench in northwest Iraq yesterday.

A Peshmerga colonel said the grave was found near Sinuni during a search for explosives that ISIS often leaves behind, posing a threat to troops and civilians even after they withdraw.

Some of the victims had been shot dead and others 'slaughtered' using knives, he said. 

The officer, who declined to be named, said: 'Our forces were searching for explosives and mines planted by (ISIS) in the area and found the grave during the search.'

ISIS spearheaded a June offensive that began in the northern province of Nineveh, where the mass grave was discovered and overran large areas north and west of the Iraqi capital.

After sweeping south towards Baghdad, the militants again turned their attention to the north in August, driving Kurdish forces back toward their regional capital and seizing areas including Sinuni.

ISIS carried out a campaign of killings, kidnappings and enslavement against Yazidi Kurds living in the area that the UN termed an 'attempt to commit genocide.'

Backed by US-led air strikes and assisted by international trainers and advisers, Kurdish forces have made significant gains in the north.

Federal troops, Shi'ite militiamen and Sunni tribesmen have also pushed ISIS back farther south, but significant territory, including three major Iraqi cities, remains in the hands of the jihadists.
