She's been keeping a low profile in recent months since her unceremonious sacking from X Factor USA.

But it looks like Cheryl Cole is determined to make her name Stateside after landing her first Hollywood film role.

In a rare glimpse of the singer, she was spotted looking slim and toned on the set of What To Expect When You're Expecting in Atlanta, Georgia.

After months of hitting the gym near her Los Angeles apartment, the 28-year-old showed off the results in a tight black Emilio Pucci lace dress and Christian Louboutin heels as she made her way to film her first scenes.

Her sleek and confident look is a far
cry from her cute, but unsure appearance in a polka dot outfit at the X
Factor USA auditions in May.

The
film – whose cast also includes actors Dennis Quaid, Chris Rock and 
Matthew Morrison - chronicles the lives of four couples as they prepare 
to become parents.

And, in what could be construed as a side-swipe at Simon Cowell after she was sacked from X Factor USA, Cheryl will play a TV talent show judge for her cameo role in the film.

Cameron plays Jules who auditions in an X Factor-style contest in front of the TV talent show judge - Cheryl's character.

Cheryl
is said to have initially impressed Hollywood film bosses during a 
four-day appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

A
film source revealed to the Daily Mail earlier this year: ‘This is a 
bit of fun for Cheryl. She will film the scenes imminently and is really
looking forward to it.

'It doesn’t mean she suddenly wants to become an actress. It was just an opportunity that has come up while she has been having some down time and she thought it would be great fun to take part.’

A spokesperson for the singer said at the time: 'Cheryl Cole is confirmed for a small cameo appearance in 
the film What to Expect When You're Expecting.'

While
it's Cheryl's first Hollywood film role, she previously starred 
alongside her Girls Aloud bandmates in British comedy St Trinian's in 
2007.

Cheryl's appearance on set comes as she finally wrote her first tweet - two months after opening her official Twitter account.

She wrote today: 'It's me CC! WHERE MY SOLDIERS AT.......?!!! I can't believe what my fingers are doing but yes I'm tweeting :-s so here goes...X.'

She then sent a message to her new co-star Diaz, who turns 39 today.

She said: 'Happy birthday Cameron, you sexy beeeyyaatchh...X.'

Meanwhile, in a 
recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Simon Cowell said he 
wouldn't hesitate to offer Cheryl a role on another of his TV projects.

Defending his decision to replace Cheryl with Nicole Scherzinger in the U.S., Cowell said: 'You're not drowning puppies here.

'You're offering someone who's got 
millions of dollars, more money and more work. And if people think 
that's cruel, then they can do that to me on a daily basis. I'll take it
twice a day.'

Cowell also 
confirmed that he offered Cheryl the chance to return to UK X Factor, 
but negotiations fell apart and they hadn't spoken since.

He
said: 'She missed the deadline which meant she'd lost the UK show. I 
asked her manager Will.i.am, "How does she feel about it?" He said, 
"It's none of your concern."

'I never heard from her... I think her silence was quite damning.'
