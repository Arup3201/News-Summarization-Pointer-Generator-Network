Seventeen million cars are expected to take to the roads over the bank holiday weekend - despite the threat of rain.

The AA and traffic information company Trafficmaster have warned that Monday will be the busiest traffic of the year so far as it coincides with the start of the half term.

A busier-than-usual evening rush-hour on Friday and more jams on Saturday are also being predicted as thousands set off on holiday over the extended weekend.

Travel warning: 17 million cars are expected on the roads this weekend - with the M25 a hot spot

And the travel misery won’t just be on the roads.

Those travelling by rail have been warned to expected delays as they contend with engineering work in places, including amendments to West Coast services due to engineering work between London and Rugby in the West Midlands.

On the roads, a series of sporting events, air shows and music festivals are likely to add to congestion, with the M25, M1, M3, M5, M6, M27, A303, A30 and A38 expected to be particularly busy.

Breakdown experts are warning drivers that the packed roads could spell misery for 51,000 motorists.

Green Flag revealed there will be 10,300 flat batteries and one puncture every minute across the country, and 13 drivers every hour will manage to lock their keys in their car.

One driver every 15 minutes put the wrong fuel in the tank.

Rush hour: Friday evening and Saturday morning are expected to be busy as holidaymakers set off

AA patrolman of the year Mark Spowage said: ‘Whatever the weather, drivers should be prepared for extra traffic and possible delays on major routes to coastal areas and holiday resorts.

‘Planning your journey and avoiding the main bottlenecks could relieve the frustration of sitting in a traffic jam.

‘The roads are likely to be extremely busy and it could take a lot longer to get to your destination than you expect.’

Trafficmaster are warning drivers to check routes online before travel.

Traffic experts also say that sporting events are likely to add to the travel chaos, with the horse racing at the Goodwood Festival, cricket at the Oval, Golf at Wentworth and Rugby Union Heineken cup at Cardiff all causing congestion.

Popular destinations: Staycationers are expected to flock to places such as Brighton - despite the wet forecast

Mr Spowage added: ‘As the bank holiday coincides with the start of half term; many people will have taken the whole week off and be looking to get away for a break to get their summer off to a great start.

‘Preparing for your journey is important, especially if your car hasn't undertaken a long trip for a while.

‘Just take ten minutes extra to check the basics - oil and water levels, tyre pressures - check your handbook to see whether you need to increase pressures if you have a heavy load - and top up the windscreen washer.’
