Busted: GiAnni Henderson faces a litany of charges after police say her toddler fell out of her car while she was driving

A Missouri mother faces multiple charges after police say her toddler fell out of her moving car Sunday as she drove up a highway entrance ramp.

GiAnni Henderson, 30, of Kansas City, may have been drunk and high Sunday night when she was trying to merge onto a highway just outside the city when her one-year-old baby somehow tumbled out of the car.

Even more surprisingly, the child was saved by a passing motorist. The good samaritan tended to the child until paramedics arrived and was taken to a local hospital with only minor injuries, KMBC reported.

Witnesses told police Henderson was making a turn just before 6:00 p.m. when the child fell out of the carâ€™s back seat. Another child was in the car but managed to stay inside, sources said.

Henderson's 2006 Hyundai Sonata was shown being searched at the scene. Officers uncovered drugs, drug paraphernalia and even took a pink child seat.

She was subsequently charged with child endangerment, driving while intoxicated, possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, failure to provide proof of insurance, improper license plate and child restraint charges.

Shocking: Police search a Honda on the side of the busy road while Henderson (in grey with black pants) and another woman talk to investigators

Taken: Police confiscated drugs, drug paraphernalia and this pink child seat from Henderson's car

Footage from the scene shows Henderson and another woman standing on the side of the busy road talking to police as an officer walks by with the child seat.

Henderson has a prior charge for felony theft from 2012 that has yet to be settled in court.

The one-year-old has been released from the hospital. It is not clear if both children were handed back to their mother or taken into protective custody.
