Council chiefs banned the face of the Isle of Wight music festival from appearing on taxis - because she was naked.

The illustration, showing a purple-haired mermaid, has been used by the festival for the past five years.

Taxi drivers were left baffled when council bosses rejected the art deco-inspired design for being too rude.

Isle of Wight Festival promoter John Giddings tweeted: 'Just had our @IsleOfWightFest taxi design rejected by the council for the mermaid being "naked" - hilarious!!'

Too rude to grace Isle of Wight taxis - but the purple-haired mermaid has been part of the Isle of Wight Festival's promotional material for the past five years

Local firm Alpha Taxis wanted to support the festival, which attracts 90,000 music fans, by displaying its logo on its cars - but council chiefs initially said no

He later joked about plastering the offending image on the festival's shuttle buses instead, and suggested the mermaid could wear a shawl.

The firm Alpha Taxis applied to the council for permission to use the image on the back of its car to show its support for the festival.

But they were surprised to be told the graphic design of a mythical creature broke council rules.

Mr Giddings said: 'I am genuinely stunned, I thought it was a joke at first.

'I am really proud of our artwork, it's beautiful, art deco style and so distinctive of the festival.

'I feel like I am in the Vicar of Dibley - really, how would this offend anyone?'

In a U-turn, the council has now said the taxi firm can use the image.

The council initially object to a naked mythical creature appearing on Alpha Taxis' cars - but has since relented. The council licenses the taxis so must give its permission for such images

Bill Murphy, Isle of Wight Council head of planning and regulatory services, said: 'Having looked at this issue I believe the decision was the wrong one.

'We will inform the taxi company that the council does not object to the design.'

The Stone Roses, Bon Jovi, Blondie and Killers are among the line-up for the 15th festival, to be attended by 90,000 people, in Newport on June 13 - 16.
