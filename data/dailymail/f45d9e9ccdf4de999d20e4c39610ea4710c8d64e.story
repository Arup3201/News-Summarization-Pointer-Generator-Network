A Wisconsin man who became lodged in the windshield of a car that struck him said he turned to the driver and said, ‘Hello, I'm the guy you hit on the bicycle.’

The driver did not respond, but continued on, running a stop sign and hitting another vehicle before he arrived home, said the cyclist Steven Gove.

‘My entire torso was inside the car,’ said the astonished Gove.

'My entire torso was inside the car': 56-year-old newspaper carrier Steve Gove of Manitowoc, Wisconsin was struck by a driver police suspect was drunk. He became lodged in the windshield, but the 20-year-old behind the wheel somehow didn't notice

The man finally noticed a man was lodged in his windshield when he stopped the car outside his home, but he still didn’t help cove out.

‘He looked at me and said "Who are you? What are you doing in the car?"' Gove said.

‘He started freaking out: "I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail,"’ Gove recalled to htrnews.

The man then locked the car doors and went into his home. 

Gove, whose body had gone most of the way through the windshield, then pulled his knees and feet into the car.

‘I righted myself and got out,’ he said. ‘I unlocked the passenger's side door and started walking down the street.’

A witness had called police, who found Gove as he was walking and took him to a hospital. Doctors removed glass from Gove's eyes and treated him for other cuts to the head and leg.

'Who are you?' What are you doing in there?': After striking Gove, the driver continued to hit the gas--running through a stop sign and smashing into a car before pulling into him home a block away, getting out, and locking the door of the car after finally seeing Gove hanging inside

The driver, a 20-year-old Manitowoc man, was found at the home and treated at a hospital for a serious cut to the hand.

He hadn't been formally charged as of Tuesday morning, but he was facing several preliminary charges, including suspicion of drunken driving, suspicion of hit-and-run causing injury and suspicion of failing to render aid.

Gove, a 56-year-old newspaper carrier, was shocked that the driver didn't see him on his three-wheeled delivery bike.

‘I was wearing my blue overcoat with my neon reflective vest,’ said Gove. ‘I had my front and rear flashers on. I have no idea why he didn't see me.’

A 50-year-old Green Bay man died in a similar accident in 2007. Steven Warrichaiet was sentenced to 15 years in prison for hitting Tyrone Ware, driving home with Ware's body lodged in the windshield and leaving Ware in the garage while Warrichaiet went inside and fell asleep on the couch.

An autopsy showed Ware died instantly of spinal injuries.
