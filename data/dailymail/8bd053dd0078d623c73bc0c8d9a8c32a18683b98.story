Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has been pictured falling down a set of steps after addressing his adoring supporters at an airport.

The 90-year-old President - who has held the position since 1987 - took a tumble as he walked down some steps from a podium where he had been addressing his adoring supporters

He had been talking to the crowd at Harare International Airport, who had gathered to welcome Mugabe back from a trip to Ethiopia - where he had been elected chairman of the 54-state African Nation.

He claimed 'no African country' had opposed Zimbabwe's elevation to lead the organisation.

However, when you are keeping quite as firm a grasp on power as Mugabe, it doesn't do to show any sign of weakness.

As a result, some press photographers who captured the fall are claiming they were forced to delete their pictures by security personnel.

Mugabe’s spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

It is understood the President - who has overseen his once-prosperous nation's steep decline since starting to seize white-owned farms in 2000 - was helped up quickly by aides, before being whisked away in his waiting limousine.

He had been welcomed to the airport by cheering supporters, who held placards aloft - one of which said 'Your greatness resonates across Africa and beyond'.

But this is a far from widespread sentiment.

Mugabe, who celebrates his 91st birthday on February 21, has been accused of using widespread violence to win several disputed elections, according to human rights groups.  

The country suffered hyperinflation until it abandoned its currency for the US dollar in 2009, 

However, Mugabe - who, along with his wife Grace, is on the EU blacklist - still has time to take annual vacations every January to Asia, including Singapore where he has visited specialists for check-ups on his eyes, according to Zimbabwean officials.
