He used to be one of best-looking comedians of the seventies and eighties, and often played the romantic lead, as he did with Goldie Hawn in the 1978 hit film Foul Play.

But it appears that those days are very far behind Chevy Chase as he showed off a large stomach and chubby face while heading into the Today Show in New York City on Friday morning.

Dressed very down in a puffy silver jacket and a peach-colored US Open cap, the 71-year-old star didn't look too stylish either.

Chase, who has been filming Vacation - a remake of his 1983 comedy with Beverly D’Angelo - sat down with Matt Lauer on the NBC morning show to discuss his seventies stint on Saturday Night Live.

After reflecting on past comedic co-stars, including Dan Aykroyd and late John Belushi and Gilda Radner, Chevy then discussed his own decision to leave the show in its second season (though he returned many times to host and make cameos).

When asked if he ever imagined SNL lasting 40 years, he said that if he had, he 'wouldn't have left!'

In 2013 the actor told The New York Times, 'Obviously, [Saturday Night Live] has gone on and on, and after a while, people do leave. I left after the first year, but that was mostly over a girl I wanted to marry, that everybody there had told me was the wrong girl.

'I invited them all out to the wedding, and it lasted about eight months, that marriage. [Laughs.] They were all correct. But I was off the show,' he added.

His other notable films from the eighties are Fletch and Spies Like Us from 1985, Three Amigos! from 1986 and Christmas Vacation from 1989.
