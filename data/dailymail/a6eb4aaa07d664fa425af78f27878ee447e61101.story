Adam Lanza hated his volunteer-teacher mother because he believed she loved her first-grade students more than him, police reports released yesterday revealed. 

Lanza's mother Nancy volunteered at Sandy Hook Elementary School  from 1998 to 2012 and according to one unidentified witness, her mentally-disturbed son was jealous of her students.

'Lanza apparently felt that his mother loved the students more than him,' the witness said.

The new account was revealed yesterday, as state police released their final report on the shooting investigation - amounting to thousands of pages of reports, crime scene photographs of the school and Lanza home as well 911 calls and chilling video.

The report also revealed the extent of Lanza's medical illness with several witnesses speaking of an early fascination with destruction and violence.

Rampage: After shooting his mother, Lanza drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School where he proceeded to kill 6 staff and 20 first-grade students

The report traced the weeks leading up to the shooting, when Adam seemed to become more and more unhinged.

Two weeks before the shooting, 
Mrs Lanza confessed to a friend that her son was becoming 
increasingly despondent and had was put 'over the edge' when their house
 lost power during Hurricane Sandy.

Another friend told 
investigators that Mrs Lanza texted him a few days before the shooting 
to say her son had bumped his head and they were 'dealing with blood'.

The day before the shooting she had 
stayed two days at a New Hampshire hotel as part of an experiment in 
letting her son stay home alone and be independent.

She
 was shot four times in the head by her son the morning after she 
returned. The rifle used to kill her was found by police next to her 
bed.

Lanza then went to the 
Sandy Hook Elementary school where he shot dead 20 first-graders and six
 educators with a semi-automatic rifle on December 14, 2012, before 
shooting himself.

Among other disturbing elements of evidence to be revealed from a summary report last month, was the fact that in the fifth grade, Lanza wrote The Big Book of Granny, in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people, and another character talks of liking to hurt people, especially children.

The book was among items seized from Lanza's home, but there was no indication he ever handed in the book at school.

One of Lanza's former teachers told investigators that when asked to do creative writing at school he would write disturbing accounts.

'Adam would write ten pages, obsessing over battles, destruction and war,' the teacher said, according to the report. His work was 'so graphic that it could not be shared.'

Lanza was also obsessed with the 1999 shooting at Columbine High in Colorado and other mass killings, the report said.

The report also said that in 2005, Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger's disorder - an autism-like condition that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for others and behaved strangely.

A box of family photos was included in the stacks of evidence

Nobody was allowed into his room, not
 even to clean, according to the report. It said Lanza also disliked 
birthdays, Christmas and holidays and did not like to have his hair cut.

He
 also wouldn't touch doorknobs, his food had to be arranged on the plate
 in a certain way, and he changed clothes often during the day.

He was a loner at school and was repelled by crowds and loud noises.

Prosecutors issued a summary of the investigation last month that portrayed Lanza as obsessed with mass murders but the report concluded that Lanza's motives for the massacre might never be known.

Lanza 'was undoubtedly afflicted with mental health problems; yet despite a fascination with mass shootings and firearms, he displayed no aggressive or threatening tendencies', it said.

His mother had said during a lunch 
with friends just before the shooting that she never 'felt in any 
personal danger living with Adam'.

During
 the lunch she had said she was planning on leaving Newtown, and 
continuing to care for Lanza, perhaps in North Carolina or Washington 
state.

Books about dealing 
with autism were found at the family's home and a nurse who met Lanza 
four times in 2006 and 2007 had prescribed him anti-anxiety medication.

The
 nurse said in her police interview that Lanza had been diagnosed with 
obsessive compulsive disorder and was 'emotionally paralyzed', changing 
his socks 20 times a day.

Despite this his mother had stopped giving him the medication and failed to schedule follow up visits.

A photo released by the Connecticut State Police shows what the evidence report describes as a view of a second floor bathroom and its contents including a photo identification of Adam Lanza and a cellular phone with battery removed

Old newspaper clippings and a copy of Amish Grace, about a 2006 school shooting, was also found in the Lanza home

Books about Asperger syndrome, which Lanza had, were found in one of the bedrooms of the family home

Pictures believed to have been drawn by Lanza were also found in the family home.

Another interesting piece of evidence was a birthday card send to Adam by his father, Peter, which read: 'Adam, Happy Birthday - Send me an email when you want to go hiking or shooting. Love, Dad.'

Other photos and files showed that police found a stock of knives at the home and instruction manuals for the guns.

In one chilling image, a wooden bed frame sits without the mattress above a row of women's shoes.

It is known that Lanza shot dead his mother Nancy Lanza while she lay in bed before taking off on his rampage at the school.

Investigators reported that the windows of his second-floor room had been taped over with black trash bags.

Windows on a computer room on the same
 floor had also been covered over. Police found a hard drive in that 
room that was so badly damaged that forensic experts doubt they will 
ever be able to recover the information.

Spreadsheets
 about mass killings were also found, which listed information about 
each case, and police found handwritten notes listing the addresses of 
local gun shops.

A GPS taken
 from the Lanza home showed a number of trips made between the family's 
house and schools in the area, according to documents released last 
month.

Other photographs of 
the home Lanza shared with his mother show numerous rounds of 
ammunition, gun magazines, shot-up paper targets, gun cases, shooting 
earplugs and a gun safe with a rifle in it.

In another of the evidence photos a stuffed teddy bear sits incongruously atop a gun storage closet.
