More than two weeks after an estimated 234 school girls were kidnapped by Islamic extremists in Nigeria, people have taken to the streets for another day of protests to voice their unhappiness at the government’s failure to ensure the safe release of the hostages.

The girls were seized by members of the Boko Haram terrorist network at a high school in the town of Chibok in the nation's far northeast on April 16.

Armed men herded the girls out of their beds and forced them into a convoy of trucks which then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon.

With outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos on Thursday to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims.

Protesters around the world have also harnessed the power of social media using hashtags including #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand that more is done.

Celebrities including singers Mary J Blige, Janelle Monae and Deborah Cox have retweeted the call for more to be done to rescue the school girls.

‘If 230 girls can go missing for this long and nobody knows how to find them, then something's very wrong with our country,’ said Tokumbo Adebanjo, 45, a travel agent and mother.

The failure to rescue the girls is a massive embarrassment to Nigeria's government and President Goodluck Jonathan

‘I feel the pain of those other mothers. Obviously the government are not doing their job.’

President Goodluck Jonathan has said 
security forces are doing all they can to find the girls and the 
Associated Press has reported that his government is in negotiations 
with the terrorists who are demanding an unspecified ransom for the 
students' release.

News of negotiations comes as parents say the girls are being sold into marriage to Boko Haram militants.

The students are being paid 2,000 naira ($12) to marry the fighters, Halite Aliyu of the Borno-Yobe People's Forum told The Associated Press.

She said the parents' information about mass weddings is coming from villagers in the Sambisa Forest, on Nigeria's border with Cameroon, where Boko Haram is known to have hideouts.

The girls are between 16 and 18 years old and had been recalled to the school to write a physics exam when they were seized.

About 50 of the kidnapped girls managed to escape from their captors in the first days after their abduction, but some 220 remain missing, according to the principal of the Chibok Girls Secondary School, Asabe Kwambura. Two of the girls have reportedly died from snake bites.

The 
protests in Lagos follow marches the previous day in the nation’s 
capital Abuja and in Kano, Nigeria's second city in the north.

The
 demonstrators, including pregnant women, relatives of the girls and 
civil servants, waved banners saying ‘Bring Back Our Girls’, the somber 
mood of their rally accentuated by torrential rain that drenched 
everyone.

‘The
 leaders of both houses said they will do all in their power but we are 
saying two weeks already have past, we want action now,’ said activist 
Mercy Asu Abang.

‘We want our girls to come home alive - not in body bags,’ she said.

The
 demonstrators began their march outside the Hilton Abuja, one of 
Africa's most expensive hotels, where in a week's time Nigeria will be 
hosting the World Economic Forum under tight security, to be maintained 
by 6,000 soldiers.

A
 senator from the region where the girls were taken has said the 
government needs to get international help to rescue the girls.

The government must do ‘whatever it takes, even seeking external support to make sure these girls are released,’ Sen. Ali Ndume said.

‘The longer it takes the dimmer the chances of finding them, the longer it takes the more traumatized the family and the abducted girls are.’

The failure to rescue the girls is a massive embarrassment to Nigeria's government and the military, and President Jonathan, who is from the predominantly Christian south of Nigeria, has been accused of insensitivity to the plight of people in the north, who are mainly Muslims.

'Why can't the government invite other countries to help?' the chairman of the school's parents association, Dumona Mpur, said by telephone from Chibok, which he said was half-deserted.

'If the world can search for a missing Malaysian (airliner), why can't the president ask them to help look for these children?'

Boko Haram's name translates to 'Western education is a sin' in the local language.

The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write.

Rights groups say the militants kidnap girls to perform chores and sexual services.
