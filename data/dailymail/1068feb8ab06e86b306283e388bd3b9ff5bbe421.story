Sergio Aguero was not the only superhero on display at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday night - as Wearside's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man made an unwelcome appearance on the pitch.

A pitch invader dressed in full 'Spidey Suit' ran on to the field during Manchester City's 4-1 victory over Sunderland on Wednesday night.

And he fully embraced the character of the Marvel Comic superhero - including by pretending to fire his web-shooters at City defender Martin Demichelis.

But despite Spider-Man's attempt to claim the limelight, it was that man Aguero who stole the show once more.

The Argentina striker netted twice - including a thunderbolt from the edge of the area that had Black Cats substitute Jozy Altidore shaking with fright - as City consolidated their place in second in the Premier League.

Stevan Jovetic and Pablo Zabaleta scored the other goals as the visitors came from behind to triumph at the Stadium of Light.

Connor Wickham had put the home side ahead but City soon recovered to claim the victory.
