A faithful German shepherd who defended his family by chasing away a bear risked being euthanized after his owners gave him up because of allergies and issues with their landlord. 

Luckily, activists took up Duke's case shortly after he was surrendered to New York City Animal Care and Control. The four-year-old pup's incredible story inspired a rescue organization adopt him and save him from the risk of being put down. 

Duke's owners admitted when he surrendered the dog that he had been a faithful companion. 

Duke was surrendered by his family after four years - even after he saved them from a bear

'Duke is very protective of his family and will growl at strangers if they get close to them,' according to a report from Animal Care and Control. 

When asked about how Duke interacts with other animals, the owner responded: 'He chases deer and has chased a bear away from the family.'

Pet Rescue Examiner, which champions pets that are in danger of being killed in shelters, picked up on Duke's incredible story.

'What a way to repay a loyal four-year-old German shepherd who protected his family by chasing a bear away; his reward - the family surrenders the dog to New York City Animal Care and Control citing allergies as the reason they are signing Duke's death sentence,' Examiner writer Cheryl Hanna says.

Despite being fearsome enough to chase away a bear more than three times his size, his owners described Duke as 'a big puppy.'

 'He likes to sneak under owners' arms while they're sitting and rest his head on their laps, giving them "hugs." He loves to be cuddled, kissed, and hugged,' an Animal Care and Control report says. 

Records show that Duke was given up for adoption on July 30 in the Bronx, New York. 

The Examiner reports that he could have been euthanized at any time after being dropped off at the shelter.

Complicating his adoption process,Duke snapped at shelter staff as he was being handed over and he was listed as a 'New Hope' case - meaning only specially-trained foster homes could adopt him. 

On Tuesday, a rescue organization came to Duke's aid and retrieved him from Animal Care and Control. No word yet on whether he has found permanent owners.
