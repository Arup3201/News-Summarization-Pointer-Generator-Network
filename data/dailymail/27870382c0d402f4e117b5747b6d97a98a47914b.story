A petrol station employee has been suspended after she refused to hand over cash to an armed robber.

Betty Green was working at the Speedway gas station in Lexington, Kentucky, when a man came in and demanded cash.

At about 8pm on Saturday night, a man came into the store, off Tates Creek, and bought some beer then handed her a note. 

Suspended: Betty Green was suspended from her job after she handed over cash to an armed robber

She told lex18.com: 'I started reading it, and it said "I don't want anyone to get hurt, take your money in the drawer, put it in a bag and give it to me."'

He then lifted up his shirt to show a gun but Betty staunchly refused to hand over any money.

'I looked at him and I said "no," and he grinned at me, and picked up his purchases and left,' she said.

The shocked clerk called 911 but has since been suspended by her bosses for not following company rules of handing over the cash then pressing the panic button.

'What is it they want you to do?" Give them the money - that was the big thing I didn't do.' She explained. 

'I don't think anybody knows what you are going to do until it happens to you. I was in shock, I just said no, not me.' 

Robber: CCTV captured the man going into the gas station

Gas station: The owners, Speedway, say Betty didn't follow procedures and has been suspended

Person of interest: Lexington boxer Shawn Kirk has been identified as a person of interest for the robbery

Betty said things may have gone differently if she had been told there were two other robberies at Speedway stores earlier that day. 

Lexington boxer Shawn Kirk is a person of interest for all three crimes. Kirk was arrested for forcing his way into an apartment on Dalton Court Sunday night.

Betty said she hopes to get justice.

She said: 'Right and wrong are important, and what he did was wrong. My outcome was right. No one was hurt and I was able to diffuse the situation from getting worse.'

Speedway Corporate told lex18.com they could not comment on employee matters.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
