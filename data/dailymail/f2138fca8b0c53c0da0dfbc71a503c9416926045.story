Chelsea took another giant step towards the Premier League title by seeing odd a determined effort from Hull City at the KC Stadium.

Jose Mourinho's men saw their 2-0 lead wiped out by Steve Bruce's side, but Loic Remy's winner moved the Blues six points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand.

Here's how Sportsmail's NEIL ASHTON rated the players at the KC Stadium:

Loic Remy came off the bench to score the winner for Chelsea in their victory at Hull

HULL CITY 

ALLAN McGREGOR - 5.5

The Hull goalkeeper had little chance with Chelsea's goals.

MICHAEL DAWSON - 6.5

He had a jittery opening but improved after the change in formation.

ALEX BRUCE - 6 

Once he got to grips with Diego Costa he got better.

PAUL McSHANE - 6.5

An early switch to right back spared him.

AHMED ELMOHAMADY - 7.5

Scored a very nice goal and is one of the Premier League’s biggest secrets.

Ahmed Elmohamady scores Hull's first goal in the 26th minute to bring them back into the game

GASTON RAMIREZ - 6.5

The 24-year-old Uruguayan was diligent and energetic before he was eventually substituted.

JAKE LIVERMORE - 6

He seemed to be taken by surprise with pace of game but eventually improved.

DAVID MEYLER - 6

Always put his body on the line. A decent enough performance.

ANDY ROBERTSON - 6.5 

He made a good run down the left for Elmohamady's goal.

DAME N’DOYE - 6.5

Provided a threat to the Chelsea defence, particularly in first half. 

ABEL HERNANDEZ - 7

The 24-year-old striker was denied by Thibaut Courtois once, but not twice.

SUBSTITUTES - Stephen Quinn - 6 (Meyler 80): Hull were stretched to limit by time he came on.

Sone Aluko - 6 (Robertson 81): Tough for him to get a chance once Chelsea tightened up.

Robbie Brady -6 (Ramirez 80): Came on as a last throw of the dice.

NOT USED: Stephen Harper, Liam Rosenior, Curtis Davies, Yannick Sagbo.

MANAGER - STEVE BRUCE: 6.5 - A tactical switch at 2-0 down brought Hull back in to it.

CHELSEA

THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5

The Belgian thought he was 'sweeper keeper' Manuel Neuer for Hernandez's equaliser - he isn’t. A triple save spared Chelsea.

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 6.5

An awful backpass that led to Hernandez's goal, but the Serbian was better in the second half.

GARY CAHILL - 6.5

A sky high punt towards end of first half said it all, but he was much more composed in the second half.

JOHN TERRY - 6.5

The Chelsea captain lost composure and his usual excellent organisation in a mad five minutes.

FILIPE LUIS - 6

The Brazilian full-back was terrorised throughout by Elmohamady. 

RAMIRES - 5

He was awful and substituted. Bring back the old Ramires.

NEMANJA MATIC - 5 

He used to boss the midfield, but is  now being bossed.

WILLIAN - 6

He made a couple of decent touches and put in some hard work, but seriously, is that it?

CESC FABREGAS - 7

Credit to this guy because he never stops running and was hugely influential in the second half.

EDEN HAZARD - 7.5

A magnificent strike after less than two minutes to give Chelsea the lead.

DIEGO COSTA - 6.5

A sweet strike to put Chelsea 2-0 up before he was substituted with a leg injury.

Diego Costa was on the score sheet before he was forced off injured in the second half

SUBSTITUTES: Oscar - 6 (Ramires 61): A change that had to happen, although Oscar is out of touch too.

Loic Remy - 7.5 (Costa 75): What an impact, he scored with his first touch.

Remy came off the bench to score past Allan McGregor in the 77th minute to secure a Chelsea win

Kurt Zouma - 6.5 (Willian 80) Defensive substitution to tighten it up.

NOT USED: Petr Cech, Juan Cuadrado, Cesar Azpilucueta, Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

MANAGER - JOSE MOURINHO: 6.5 - An enforced substitution dragged him out of a hole.

REFEREE - MICHAEL OLIVER: 7 - Looked like he had forgotten his cards, but did a decent job.
