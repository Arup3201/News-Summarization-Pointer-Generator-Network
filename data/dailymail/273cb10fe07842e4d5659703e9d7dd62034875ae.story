When the Xbox Kinect sensor, which gives Microsoft's gaming console the ability to 'see' you and respond to your body movements was launched, the thing that took everyone by surprise was what could be done with it outside of gaming.

One of the latest projects spawned by 
enthusiasts brings science-fiction-like holograms to the masses - using 
nothing more than a DSLR camera, which have reduced in price over the 
last few years to become affordable to the masses, and a Kinect.

The Creators Project uses the raw, high-definition footage of a DSLR camera and maps it against the 3D space that the Kinect can see, bringing, as the video below shows, a hologram effect from equipment which can be found in many households.

The technology mixes the images from a DSLR camera with an Xbox Kinect sensor to create holograms

The Kinect sensor is able to detect a view in 3D, and then software maps the images to create a hologram

The RGBDToolkit was designed by James
George, Jonathan Minard and photographer Alexander Porter at the the 
Carnegie Mellon University in Philadelphia.

The team has now released the software and instructions on the project website to allow people to try this at home.

While the Kinect was primarily 
released for gaming, Microsoft suddenly found themselves with a surprise
hit - one of the fastest-selling gadgets in history - when enthusiasts 
and programmers realised they could hook it up to a computer and push a 
new frontier in technology.

Microsoft quickly cottoned on to the 
side potentials of the device and released drivers for Windows PCs, 
allowing programmers to jump onboard.

From space agencies strapping the 
sensors onto satellites, to movie fans giving their televisions a 
unique, body-controlled remote control, the humble game controller 
accidentally gave people a glimpse of the future.

Multi-track: The technology can pick up more than one person at a time

The technology can also be used to landscape rooms and other vistas

The equipment: A standard DSLR, available in most electronics shops for around Â£400, can be used to produce the images
