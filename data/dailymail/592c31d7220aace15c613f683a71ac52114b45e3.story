Anger grew yesterday after it was revealed that a gardener who drained £200,000 from the accounts of a vulnerable elderly woman will escape punishment.

The handyman used a ruling by the controversial Court of Protection to convince the confused 89-year-old to sign over control of her finances.

But a judge said the Crown Prosecution Service was ‘not totally confident’ it could prove the unnamed handyman had committed a crime.

A ruling by the Court of Protection allowed a gardener to take more than £200,000 from an 89-year-old woman

Legal experts yesterday described the decision not to pursue a case for theft or fraud as ‘astonishing’ and challenged the common sense of the rules that allowed him to get away scot free.

MPs on both sides of the Commons also called for reforms to the Mental Capacity Act, under which the secretive court was set up.

Dr David Green, a criminologist who has advised the Home Office and is director of the Civitas think-tank, said the CPS should have allowed a jury to decide whether the gardener’s behaviour was ‘acceptable’.

He added: ‘This is a particularly astonishing case because on the surface it is a very clear-cut case of fraud and exploitation of a vulnerable person.

‘The most disturbing thing is that this case has not resulted in a charge in the criminal courts.’

The Mental Capacity Act was set up under Labour nine years ago to protect the elderly, sick and vulnerable. But it has come under increasing criticism.

Last week peers said it had led to the wrongful imprisonment of tens of thousands of people in care homes.

MPs and legal experts have blasted the court's 'astonishing' ruling and called for reforms of the court

They said it also  contained supposed safeguards which were ‘wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them’.

The case involving the gardener was revealed in a ruling published by a judge at the Court of Protection.

It said the Kent handyman acquired a Lasting Power of Attorney that enabled him to control the elderly woman’s finances, even though an NHS social worker had questioned his motives.

Although he can no longer handle his employer’s money, he is estimated to have kept more than £60,000. 

Senior Judge Denzil Lush said the CPS felt unable to prove his guilt following a police investigation. The judge also decided not to publish the name of the gardener.

Yesterday a spokesman for the judiciary at the Royal Courts of Justice defended that decision on the grounds that it protected the identify of a ‘vulnerable adult’.

MPs joined criticism of the Mental Capacity Act last night.

Since it was sanctioned by the Labour Government, the Court of Protection has sparked fears that mentally frail and vulnerable people will not be sufficiently protected

Senior Labour MP Jim Dobbin, who questioned the Act when it was before Parliament, said: ‘My concerns at the time were that individuals with reduced mental capacity would become victims of secret court decisions.

This act needs amendment to protect vulnerable people, who must always be at the forefront of our concerns.’

Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: ‘This shows we should never trust secret courts and experts.

The whole point of the Act and the Court of Protection is we should leave it to experts – and this is an example of the sort of thing that happens if you do.

The Mental Capacity Act has unravelled. It was produced by a government that banged on about human rights, and then passed a law like this.’

The CPS confirmed yesterday that the Metropolitan Police had investigated the case but said it did not know how the decision not to prosecute was taken. A spokesman said: ‘We don’t have any record of who it went to at the CPS.’
