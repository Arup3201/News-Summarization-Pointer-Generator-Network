Angel Di Maria had to be sent off by referee Michael Oliver for grabbing the official’s shirt after being correctly cautioned for simulation.

The United player will be awaiting the reaction from the FA, who usually take a dim view of physical contact with officials.

I hope there is not too strong a reaction as Di Maria’s touch was light and born of frustration rather than aggression.

As Oliver only gave a second yellow for the offence, the FA are unlikely to punish Di Maria further. Di Maria had been booked earlier for a dive.

Oliver delivered a really impressive refereeing performance which belied his age (30). He was consistent, strong and impartial throughout.

The first serious foul brought a very early yellow card for Hector Bellerin though later Oliver showed tolerance when Bellerin just clipped Ashley Young, who demanded a second yellow card which was unsporting and unnecessary.
