From new trainers to gym membership, Britons will spend £2.8billion fighting the flab this January according to new research.

More than four in five Brits (82 per cent) will start a health kick this year with two fifths (42 per cent) revealing they'll be focusing on their fitness, according to a study carried out by VoucherCodes.co.uk.

Aspiring gym bunnies will splash out £56 on clothing to ensure they look the part while sweating out Christmas excesses on the treadmill.

High price to keep fit: Brits will spend a £2.8billion fighting the flab this January

The average gym goer will also spend £76.50 on additional fitness equipment - that's a total of £132.50 per person for getting fit in 2014 on average.

More than half of the 2000 Brits surveyed admitted they'll start their health kick by concentrating on their food and alcohol intake.

'Dry January' is set to be bigger than ever with more than a third of Brits (39 per cent) vowing to give up drinking in 2014 - a 28 per cent increase on last year. Not only will this could good for their livers, it will also fatten up their wallet as less money will be spent in the pub and on bottles of wine. 

Meanwhile, two fifths (45 per cent) will take on a detox plan and a third (31 per cent) will splash out an average of £28.30 on kitchen equipment such as steamers and juicers to help them fulfil their health goals.

Willpower: Men are more likely to stick to a health kick according to a study

However, the good intentions don't always last long - just three per cent of Brits will manage to make a permanent change to their lifestyle and nearly a quarter of Brits (23 per cent) will have given up on their new regime by 1st February.

Men are more determined about sticking with a healthy plan - 54 per cent of those who take up a fitness regime or diet will still be following it by 1st April - ten per cent more than their female counterparts.

Anita Naik, consumer editor of Vouchercodes.co.uk, said there are ways people can get fit without over spending. She advised: 'Whether you're planning to join a gym, sign up to a new class or start a diet it's worth investigating whether you can try before you buy. Nationwide gyms sometimes offer short term passes of 1-5 days so you can see whether a longer membership will work for you.

'Similarly diet providers will often offer introductory discounts so you can see whether a new eating plan fits with your lifestyle. There are even savings to be made on new equipment if you’re planning to work out at home so make sure you check sites like VoucherCodes.co.uk to find out the best deals to suit your resolution.'

AVOID EXPENSIVE GYM CONTRACTS Many people will join a gym in January with the best intentions and sign up for a year paying £50+ per month. But what if you find once you join that the gym isn't for you or a change of circumstances affects how often you can go? Avoid getting locked into an expensive contract you don't need by seeing if you can do a free trial first. Also, opt for council-run and basic gyms over their luxurious counterparts where your membership may be spent on decadent decor and wash products. Many gyms today offer pay-as-you-go classes that are also a cheaper and more flexible alternative.

BUY BUDGET BRANDS You don't have to spend a fortune on clothing and trainers, especially if you are someone who will give up on your health kick by February. Try websites like eBay and check discount websites for offer codes for sports shops. Supermarkets such as Aldi and Sainbury's also now offer sports gear. It might not be as high tech as bigger sports brands but will do the job if you only intend to work out once or twice a week. Then if you do get hooked on exercise, you can then make a bigger investment in kit that you know won't be going to waste.

GET RUNNING

Run free: ParkRuns take place every Saturday around the UK

Running is one of the cheapest and simplest forms of exercise to take up. Get some trainers (note the above on not overspending until you're sure you're going to continue) and head out the door whenever you feel like it. If you find you need some company and motivation then there's also numerous ways you can obtain this without spending lots of money. Running clubs around the country offer annual membership at the fraction of the cost of gyms (and are suitable for beginners). Visit www.britishathletics.org.uk/grassroots/search to find a club near you. Or you can gain a free online running community thanks to Jantastic, a free running challenge for all abilities. Participants sign up as individuals or as part of a team, then set themselves goals to strive for in January, February and March. Miles run can be logged as you go along and experiences shared with other users so you don't feel alone when you're pounding the pavements. Visit Jantastic.me. Finally, another way to run with others and strive to get faster without spending a penny is ParkRun. These are timed 5K runs that take place in parks around the UK every Saturday morning at 9am. The runs are free to enter and are for all abilities. Visit www.parkrun.org.uk for more information.

WORKOUT AT HOMEMany fitness programmes from industry experts can be carried out from the comfort of your own home without having to pay to go to a gym or buying expensive equipment. There are online programmes you can follow like former GB athlete Louise Hazel's Podium Effect, books like the bestselling Fat Burn Revolution by personal trainer Julia Buckley and fitness DVDs from stars such as Nell McAndrew. A one-off payment for a DVD, book or online membership could be all you need to spend to give you the tools and knowledge you need to get into shape.
