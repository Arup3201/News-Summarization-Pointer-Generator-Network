Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has come out in defence of Premier League initiation ceremonies for new arrivals - and revealed Florent Sinama Pongolle's dancing when he arrived at the Reds 'was the best thing' he'd ever seen.

Murphy's comments come in the wake of the Professional Footballers' Association's attempts to ban clubs from being able to initiate new signings.

And the ex-England and Fulham star believes initiation ceremonies are, in many cases, harmless - using the example of Sinama Pongolle to highlight this.

Murphy told TalkSPORT: 'I remember a young French kid at Liverpool called Sinama Pongolle.

'We were on a night out initiating some of the young players and he said: "I can't sing, do you mind if I dance?"

'So we were like "no" and we put this song on and said: "Show us what you've got".

'He did the break-dancing, the robotics, the somersaults, the Michael Jackson moves - it was the best thing I've ever seen!

'And from that minute on we didn't care how good a player he was. Everyone just loved him for the dance floor.'
