Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin today said the cancellation of the West Coast franchise is 'deeply regrettable'

Ministers spent £1million preparing to take charge of the West Coast main line from Whitehall before resorting to pleading with Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin trains to continue running his trains.

Five civil servants drew up a plan for the lucrative line from London to Scotland to be renationalised after the collapse of the franchise competition which had been won by Virgin’s rival FirstGroup.

But as the clock ticked down to the December 9 deadline when Virgin was due to be kicked off the London to Scotland line, ministers were forced to ask Sir Richard to stay on while they find a more permanent solution.

The £1million price tag for the abortive plan for the line to be taken back into public control will raise further questions about the Department for Transport’s handling of big rail franchises.

Labour's shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle today responded to the revelation by calling on ministers to 'come clean' about the full scale of the cost of the fiasco.

FirstGroup was awarded the £13billion, 13-year deal in August but Virgin launched a legal challenge.

As officials prepared for the High Court proceedings last month, ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed. Three civil servants were suspended and the deal was suspended.

In a major PR coup for Virgin, last week Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin asked Sir Richard to continue running services after December 9 for up to 13 months.

However, it has now emerged that the minister drew up plans to take control of the line himself, through the government’s company, Directly Operated Railways.

The West Coast main line is Britain's busiest rail route, connecting London to Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow

Transport minister Simon Burns told 
MPs: ‘Directly Operated Railways has been undertaking prudent 
contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready should 
they be required. 

‘We do 
not yet have final figures, but spend to date has been around £1 
million. This includes expenditure on salaries and consultants.’

He added that the work consisted of 
‘prudent contingency preparations and they will continue to stand ready 
should they be required’.

Mr Burns was responding to parliamentary questions.

The
Department for Transport had ‘a core team of five working wholly or 
partly on the contingency planning and they were supported, where 
needed, by colleagues from other areas of the Department’.

The collapse of the deal is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than £100million in compensation and re-running a
new bidding process.

Refunding
the franchises is expected to cost £40million, but it had been 
predicted that the eventual bill fort taxpayers could cost £100million.

The
decision not to nationalise the line is likely to be raised when Mr 
McLoughlin appears in front of MPs at the transport select committee at 
the end of this month.

In September Mr McLoughlin insisted: ’I’m determined the trains will not stop running.’

The Flying Scotsman service was reintroduced by the government-owned Directly Operated Railways on the East Coast line

Labour MPs called for him to renationalise the West Coast main line, citing the example of the East Coast line which the Labour governmentt ook over in 2009 when  National Express walked away from the franchise.

Julie Hilling, Labour MP for Bolton West, said: ‘As a directly operated railway, the east coast main line returned £187 million to the taxpayer last year.’

She asked how much money Virgin will pay to the taxpayer during the period of extension to its west coast main line franchise. Mr McLoughlin said negotiations remain ongoing.

Today Ms Eagle said: 'It’s increasingly clear that taxpayers are set to be stung for far more than the £40 million cost of this shambles so far admitted by Ministers, with the final bill likely to top £100million.

'We now know that the costs of preparing to take over the West Coast line topped six figures, and the Transport Secretary has still not come clean about the many millions of pounds that will have to be paid back to compensate bidders for the suspended Great Western, Essex Thameside and Thameslink franchises.

'It’s time for the Government to accept that it is completely unacceptable for the Department for Transport’s own board to investigate itself.

'Taxpayers deserve a truly independent inquiry into what went wrong and who was to blame for so much of their money being poured down the drain.'
