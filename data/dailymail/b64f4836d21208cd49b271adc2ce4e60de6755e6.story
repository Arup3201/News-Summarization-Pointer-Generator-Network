Wigan legend Martin Offiah risked looking like ‘Satan’ by defending Ben Flower’s attack on Lance Hohaia which saw the Warriors prop become the first player to be sent off in a Super League Grand Final.

Flower and the St Helens half-back came together after just two minutes of the match, Flower flooring Hohaia with a punch before striking again while he lay motionless on the ground.

Hohaia played his part in the incident by running over to Flower and thrusting his forearm into the face of the Wales forward after a collision between the two.

‘Second punch Flower threw was over the top but in RL if you forearm somebody in the face you can’t complain if he clocks you one,’ Offiah wrote on Twitter.

‘You don’t attack props and there was some provocation. If by stating that it makes me satan then so be it lol.’

Hohaia failed to return to action after the incident.
