A man has left his 4,270-square-foot home and $250,000 fortune to his cats, rather than to his five children and their families.

Leon Sheppard Sr., 79, of Memphis, Tennessee, passed away last December and now it his been revealed that his will stipulates that his two cats must be kept in the style that they’ve grown accustomed to.

Sheppard’s will states that his fortune should be used for the continued pampering of Frisco and Jake and the maintenance of the gated community home in which they live.

Neighbors have confirmed - unsurprisingly - that Sheppard loved his cats, while one of his daughter's told WMCTV that the family doesn’t wish to discuss their father’s unusual dying wish.

According to the will, which is perfectly legal, when Frisco - the older of the two felines - dies whatever is left of the estate including the house can then be passed to Sheppard's human heirs.

It is also stipulated that Jake must continue to be cared for, although he can be moved out of the house.

While it is extremely rare for people to leave large amount of money to their pets, it isn’t totally unheard of and New York hotel heiress Leona Helmsley famously left $12 million to her dog, Trouble.

Sheppard’s request may seem unusual but he is fondly remembered by many.

He was president of a local branch of the United Food and Commercial Workers union for nearly 40 years, during which time he boosted the membership from 400 to over 12,000 and earned a reputation as someone who looked after his members.

He retired in 1994 to enjoy golf and spend more time with his cats and family.

Sheppard was also a huge supporter of Leukemia 
and Lymphoma Research and he raised over a million dollars for research through holding golf tournaments.

His wife Lucinda is also dead and he is survived by his five children, 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
