Italy midfielder Riccardo Montolivo’s World Cup dream came to a painful and public end at Craven Cottage after he broke his left leg against the Republic of Ireland.

Montolivo was captaining his country with coach Cesare Prandelli resting many of his big-name players from this warm-up game before they face England in Brazil on June 14.

The 29-year-old enjoyed the  honour for just 13 minutes until he was tackled by Alex Pearce within touching distance of the dugout - in front of England’s Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, watching from the Fulham directors’ box.

Worried: Italy captain Riccardo Montolivo was injured in the friendly against Ireland

Painful: Montolivo came off worse in a challenge with Ireland defender Alex Pearce in the first-half

The AC Milan captain briefly got to 
his feet and took a few steps before collapsing in agony. He was treated
 by paramedics on the pitch for three minutes as concerned teammates 
stood over him.

A grimace 
suggested he knew that his hopes of making it to a second World Cup were
 over. He appeared to mouth ‘Mi sono rotto,’ - ‘I’ve broken it’ - to the
 bench. He was later confirmed to have fractured the tibia bone in his 
left leg.

Instead of 
travelling with his teammates to their training camp in  Florence, he 
spent the night at Chelsea and Westminster hospital and will be flown to
 Milan on Sunday for emergency surgery.   

‘All
 our thoughts are for Riccardo,’ said Prandelli later. ‘He is a key 
player, so everybody is really cut up. They’re so upset right now. He 
has a really good attitude. He’s such a great personality on and off the
 pitch and I think all the lads were really shocked.

‘Obviously
 after what happened the players were distracted, psychologically it is 
difficult to move on. It is too emotional to consider now how it affects
 the squad.’

Injury: Montolivo received treatment on the pitch before eventually leaving on a stretcher

Something to prove: Italy coach Cesare Prandelli named a changed side for the game against Ireland

Before the 
injury, Montolivo seemed almost certain to make Prandelli’s 23-man 
party, expected to be announced Sunday, and he was likely to have 
featured in the starting XI in the first game in Group D. 

The
 player, who made seven appearances for the Azzurri during the 
qualifying campaign, would have been an important cog in  Italy’s attack
 and a valuable experienced presence in the camp.

Italy
 remain without a victory since September, after five draws and a defeat
 to Spain. It is difficult to pinpoint how useful Hodgson will have 
found last night’s game in gauging the challenge England will face when 
they open their World Cup campaign in Manaus.

It
 was an experimental line-up with the players who are likely to provide 
the biggest threat to England left on the bench. Andrea Pirlo, the 
35-year-old midfield maestro who was probably on British soil in an 
Italy shirt for the final time, did not play. The 22,879 crowd, a fairly
 even split of Azzurri blue and Irish tricolour,  witnessed several 
fabulous passes by Daniele De Rossi after his introduction on 62 
minutes.

Star man: Mario Balotelli was named on the bench for Italy's game against Ireland

Safe hands: Experienced goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was another player named on the bench for Italy

Gianluigi Buffon, 
at 36 still one of the world’s best goalkeepers, was rested although his
 deputy Salvatore Sirigu did a superb job of thwarting several Ireland 
shots.

‘He was the biggest positive for me,’ said Prandelli.

Ireland
 were  boisterous opponents committed to every tackle. Norwich’s Anthony
 Pilkington exposed frailties in the Italian defence, getting the better
 of Mattia De Sciglio on several occasions.

‘I
 thought we played very well,’ said manager Martin O’Neill. ‘Italy 
started off well but I thought we could have scored a few goals. When I 
heard there was going to be 20,000 people here, I realised nobody was 
taking this as a friendly. It was very competitive from start to 
finish.’

O’Neill expects the
 future of his assistant Roy Keane — a Celtic target — to be decided 
before Ireland fly to America on Wednesday where they face Portugal and 
Costa Rica.
