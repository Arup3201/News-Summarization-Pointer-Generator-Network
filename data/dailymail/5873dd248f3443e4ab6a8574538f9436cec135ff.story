A ball gown worn by the then Princess Elizabeth and gifted to a telephone operator  is now to be auctioned. 

The dress designed by influential fashion designer Norman Hartnell, the respected and official Royal Family clothier, is set to make a minimum of £25,000. 

Speaking to a 1961 issue of Woman's Own which featured the beautiful gown, Kathleen Ward, who worked at Buckingham Palace for six years, gives an extraordinary insight into the royal family before the coronation of the monarch.

In 1949, 18-year-old Kathleen applied for a job at Clarence House - the new home of the Princess and the Duke of Edinburgh.

A few weeks after starting, Kathleen found herself sat in front of the future Queen, who was wearing a pale green wool dress, in her sitting room.

Kathleen's candid recollection of her meeting Princess Elizabeth and subsequently securing a job as a telephone operator was published in a 1961 issue of Woman's Own.

In the article, Kathleen said of her meeting: 'As soon as she looked at me, I could see the doubt in the Princess's eyes.

'She had expected a middle-aged woman, and was obviously astonished to see a young girl.

'She asked me whether I felt capable of managing a switchboard.

''You see,' she told me, 'I look upon the job of telephonist as one of great importance, for it is often the first impression, people have of Clarence House.'

'Then, the question I had been hoping to avoid - my age. With all the dignity I could muster, I replied: 'Nearly 19, your Highness.

'I remember flushing, for I was a good nine months off 19.'

The future Queen of England replied, 'you are rather young' and Kathleen says she left believing she had not been successful in her regal interview.

But she received a letter from General Sir Frederick Browning, the Comptroller at Clarence House, and husband of author Daphne Du Maurier, saying she would join the staff.

Kathleen was an employee at the time Princess Anne was born in 1950 and remembers being given a glass of champagne when the news spread throughout the palace.

'It had always been the custom that whenever one of the Royal Family celebrated a birthday, glasses of sherry were brought round to each member of staff.

'This time the glasses contained champagne.'

Later, Kathleen said she received a telephone call to go to to see 'Miss MacDonald' and she says she 'hurried to her room'.

Kathleen told the magazine: 'Laid out for me to try were three dresses which belonged to Princess Elizabeth.

'A red velvet evening dress, a dusty pink afternoon dress and a pink and white Hartnell evening dress.

'As I gazed at the ball gown, I remembered seeing a photograph of the Princess and the Duke of Edinburgh in a night club-She had been wearing this same dress.

'These clothes were so well made I hardly dared wear them, until, at my fiance's suggestion, I plucked up enough courage to wear the Hartnell gown at his office ball a few weeks later.'

Kathleen goes on to talk about meeting the Queen Mother, who gave her a yellow iron for a wedding present, Christmas parties and other gifts betrothed to her during her tenure.

The telephone operator left her post in spring 1956 because the telephone operating system at Clarence House was to be operated by the General Post Office.

On her last day, by which time Elizabeth had become Queen, she was given a send-off by the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret 'wearing a brown taffeta dress and smiling'.

Kathleen explained: 'The Queen Mother held out her hand to me: 'Thank you for all the years you have been with us,' she said, and handed me a small leather box holding a royal brooch.

'Then she gave me an invitation I shall always remember: 'It has been nice to know you, do come and see us again sometime.' 

Speaking about the gown, which measures 17' on the chest and a slim 12' on the waist, she added: 'I remember it when I look at the pink ball gown hanging in my wardrobe.' 

Now the vintage copy of Woman's Own magazine in which Kathleen's heartwarming story and the dress were featured is also going under the hammer.

The sale of six lots also includes documents from Buckingham Palace to Kathleen, who received the dress in 1949.
