It was 'very sweet' of Bill to take on her critics, but she doesn't need her husband rushing to her defense when she gets bullied on the political playground, Hillary Clinton told PBS yesterday.

'I don’t need anybody to defend my record. I think my record speaks for itself,'  Hillary said after Bill's remarks yesterday at the annual Clinton Global Initiative America conference.

Enough is enough: Hillary says she regrets saying she and Bill were 'dead broke, 'but my unartful use of those few words doesn't change who I am, what I've stood for my entire life, what I stand for today'

Thanks but no thanks: Hillary told PBS' Gwen Ifill she doesn't need her political heavyweight husband fighting her battles

At the CGI America event yesterday in Denver, Colorado, Bill Clinton struck back at his wife's critics, telling NBC host David Gregory in an on-stage interview that Hillary is not 'out of touch.'

In law school, she advocated for legal assistance 
for the poor, and in the '70s she fought for paid leave for new mothers, he said.

'We go to our local grocery store on the weekend. We talk to people in our town. We know what's going on.'

The former president was responding to complaints lodged against his wife since she told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001 and in debt.

'We
 had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece 
together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's 
education,' Hillary told Sawyer in an interview earlier this month.

'You know, it was not easy.'

Republican 
National Committee Chair Reince Priebus pounced on Hillary's comments immediately after the interview.

'This is outrageous,' he tweeted. 'How out of 
touch is Hillary Clinton when "dead broke" = mansions & massive 
speaking fees?'

Bill told Gregory yesterday, 'It is factually true that we were several million dollars in debt.'

'Someone is always trying to change the subject,' he said of people making attacks on he and his wife's finances.

Republicans promptly criticized Bill as out of touch, too, pointing out that Clintons live in a wealthy neighborhood in New York. The people they talk to on the weekends from their town are most likely rich like them.

'The Clintons have lived in a 1 percent bubble for so long, their 
experience has become warped, and that’s a major problem in a 
presidential campaign,' America Rising PAC Executive Director Tim Miller told The Hill. 'The couple’s home is in Chappaqua,
 N.Y.'

By the time Bill did an interview with Bloomberg Television today, he had effectively been put back in his place by his wife.

Asked about Hillary's 2016 plans, Bill told Bloomberg TV's Willow Bay, 'I don’t know, but I’m for whatever she wants to do.

'If
 she were to run and become president, the last thing she needs is for 
me to be under foot,' he said. 'She’s the ablest public servant I’ve 
ever known.'

Bill insisted 
that if he were back in the White House, he'd mind his own business and 
wouldn't attempt to stick his nose where it doesn't belong.

He would only get involved in White House affairs, he said, if his wife requested him to.

'I
 would help. Whatever I was asked to do, I would do. I believe -- just 
like I do for President Obama, just like I did for President Bush. I 
think that’s -- you’ve been a former president, you need to show up when
 you’re summoned,' he said.

In her PBS interview Hillary admitted saying she and Bill were 'dead broke' was a mistake but said the misstep shouldn't negate the time she's spent championing the causes of the less fortunate.

'I shouldn’t have said the five or so words that I said, but my unartful use of those few words doesn’t change who I am, what I’ve stood for my entire life, what I stand for today,' she said.

'Bill and I have had terrific opportunities, both of us, you know, have worked hard, but we’ve been grateful for everything that we’ve been able to achieve, and sadly that’s just not true for most Americans today.'

Clinton proceeded to tell Ifill about the plight of middle class Americans and recounted her 'long record' of fighting for the downtrodden before accusing naysayers of trying to 'take things out of context or try to create some caricature' of her that's not accurate.

When Ifill interrupted her to point out the similarities between the way she's being portrayed by Republicans to the way Democrats castigated 2012 Republican presidential nominee and wealthy businessman Mitt Romney, Clinton shut her down.

'That’s a
false equivalency,' she said. 'People can judge me for what I’ve done.'

'So I’m fully comfortable
with who I am, what I stand for and what I’ve always stood for,' she said.
