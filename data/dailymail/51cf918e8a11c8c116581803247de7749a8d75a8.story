Tony Pulis has poured cold water on his proud record of never suffering relegation by telling West Bromwich Albion supporters: ‘Just because I’ve walked in the door doesn’t mean this club will stay up.’

Pulis has been unveiled as the club’s new head coach after Alan Irvine’s sacking with West Brom one place and one point above the drop zone.

The current LMA manager of the year, won because of his improbable exploits at Crystal Palace, has admitted he wants to bring in players this transfer window to assist what he calls a ‘really difficult’ job.

Pulis also insisted his title of head coach did not matter, claiming: ‘You can call me head bottle washer if you want.’

‘It’s the right club at the right time,’ Pulis said. ‘Someone just told me they have only won four games at The Hawthorns in a year. There’s got to be something wrong, something sorted out. I can’t wait to get going.

‘Irrespective of my record, that’s by the by now. We’re out in the open. Just because I’ve walked in the door doesn’t mean this club will stay up. I’m under no illusions it will be really difficult.

‘We need the support of everybody. This place rocks when the supporters get behind the team. We need to get that going again desperately.’

Pulis will work with technical director Terry Burton on the recruitment of players this month, and said he had no problem with West Brom’s structure.

‘There has been a lot said about the way the club has been run in the past and with me coming in how it’s run in future. The most important thing is everyone works together.

‘You can call me head bottle washer if you want, the title doesn’t make a difference. As long as I know there are specific areas I’m in charge of. Everyone understands the position we’re in. We have to be together to make sure the club stays up.

‘I hope we can use the transfer window to our advantage and bring players in, which we need to. I think we have got to do business. If you look at the record of the past year, things have to be addressed.

‘You have to find a way of winning, irrespective of systems. You have to recognise the strengths of players.’
