Chilling details have emerged in the gruesome case of the the Minnesota man 
accused of fatally shooting two teenagers as they broke into his home on Thanksgiving 
Day.

According to an audio recording of the incident, the man, Byron David Smith, shot the teenage girl,  Haile Kifer, in the chest and then taunted the 18-year-old, telling her she was dying in the final moments of her life, before repeatedly shot her until she died.

Smith had allegedly shot the girl's companion Nicholas Brady, 17, minutes earlier. Police say the killer dragged their bodies to a workshop, where he kept them for a day.

basement of a man who claimed the teens broke into his home on 
Thanksgiving

Authorities learned of the accused killer's interaction with the teens from video and 
audio recordings while searching Smith's home. They subsequently seized 
several computer memory cards and computer equipment, according to the Star Tribune.

Smith, a retired U.S. State 
Department employee, was charged Monday with two counts of murder. 
According to the criminal complaint, Smith shot the teens multiple 
times.

In custody: Byron Smith was arrested after admitting to police he had killed the teens a day earlier

He told investigators his home had been broken into several times before.

Minnesota
law gives homeowners the right to protect themselves and their 
property, but Wetzel said they don't have the right to execute an 
intruder once the threat is neutralized.

Johnson told the Star Tribune: 'The whole thing is 
very sad that they lost their lives. In the same instance, if they 
hadn't been breaking into houses, they'd be alive.'

Smith told authorities that he was in his basement last Thursday when he heard a window break upstairs.

In a criminal complaint, Smith said 
he was in the basement of his home when he heard a window breaking and 
footsteps. Fearful of other recent break-ins, he shot Brady when he came into view.

When the teenager tumbled down the stars, Smith shot him in the face as he lay on the floor, looking up.

He dragged the body into his workshop
and then sat in the chair, the complaint said.

When Kifer began walking
down the stairs, he shot her and she fell down the stairs.

He tried to shoot her again with his rifle, but the gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him, the complaint noted.

'If you're trying to shoot somebody and 
they laugh at you, you go again,' Smith, 64, told investigators, according to a criminal complaint filed 
Monday.

He then shot her several times in the chest with a
.22-caliber revolver, dragged her next to her cousin, and with as she 
gasped for air, fired a shot under her chin 'up into the cranium'.

'Smith described it as "a good clean finishing shot",' according to the 
compliant, but acknowledged that he had fired 'more shots than 
(he) needed to'.

Smith said
he left the bodies in his home overnight before calling a neighbor to 
ask if he knew a good lawyer. He later asked the neighbor to contact 
police.

Another break-in? A day before they were shot to death in Byron Smith's home, a car driven by Brady was spotted in the driveway of Richard L. Johnson's home in Little Falls

A prosecutor at Morrison County District Court 
on Monday morning called Smith's reaction 'appalling.

On
Monday, he was charged with second-degree murder and police revealed he
told them he fired more shots than necessary after his gun jammed and 
Kifer laughed at him.

While Minnesota law stipulates people are allowed to use deadly force when defending their 
homes, relatives, friends, police and prosecutors claimed Smith reacted too drastically by killing them.

'A
person has every right to defend themselves and their homes, even 
employing deadly force if necessary,' Morrison County Sheriff Michel 
Wetzel said. 'Circumstances of this case however, led deputies to 
believe that Smith went beyond that point.'

Before the burglary was discovered, 
deputies were called to Smith's neighborhood because a red Mitsubishi 
Eclipse was spotted in the driveway of a home owned by Richard L. 
Johnson, Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel said.

Nicholas
Brady, 17, had been driving that car, although it wasn't registered to 
him. Deputies questioned him, but then let him go, Wetzel said.

A day later, Byron Smith shot and killed Brady and Brady's 18-year-old cousin, Haile Kifer, in the basement of his Little Falls home.

Smith told authorities that he disturbed the pair as they tried to break into his house and that he shot them in self-defense.

The same red Mitsubishi Eclipse was discovered Friday parked around the corner from Smith's property.

'There are some preliminary 
indications that the Johnson burglary may have been committed by the 
Brady boy and the Kifer girl, but it's too early now to say 
definitively,' Wetzel said, adding that more information could be made 
available later today.

The 
Minneapolis StarTribune reported that Johnson, a retired high school 
teacher, had been in Spain and did not know his home had been 
burglarized until he returned to the home on Sunday.

Johnson
told the paper that he reported several items stolen from his house, 
including less than $5 in pennies kept in a box on his dresser, silver 
and copper coins, and some prescription medication, including drugs for 
diabetes and controlling cholesterol.

Wetzel couldn't immediately say whether any of those missing items were found in Brady's car.

In addition, Johnson reported a sliding glass door that had been broken.

'I
do know they found quite a bit of evidence in their vehicle that was 
parked near the Smith place,' the sheriff said late Tuesday. 'We're 
trying to investigate whether it might have come from the Johnson 
burglary.'

Scene: Smith's home in Little Falls, MN has been burglarized eight times in recent years, his brother said

'Mr. Smith intentionally killed two teenagers in his home in a matter 
that goes well beyond self-defense,' Morrison County Attorney Brian 
Middendorf said at a hearing on Monday.

Friends have taken to a memorial Facebook page for Kifer and Schaeffel to vent their anger about the deaths. Others spoke out at a vigil for the youngsters on Sunday night.

'They were just really great people,' 
friend Rachel Stauffer, 15, told the Star Tribune. 'They 
could make anyone laugh.'

Carlee Davich, who coached Kifer in swimming at school, added: 'She was 
always happy. She had a way that just made everyone happy. A lot of the 
swimmers and divers looked up to her.'

Emma Schmidt, a fellow classmate at Little Falls High School, said Kifer was talented and well-liked
and 'everyone's wondering' what she was doing in Smith's basement.

Further
insight into the lives of the cousins was given by Brady's sister, 
Crystal Shaeffel, as she visited Smith's home and spoke with his 
brother.

'They were 17 and 18 years old, and didn't need to die,' she told Bruce Smith.

'That
all depends on your perspective,' he responded, referring to a series 
of break-ins his brother had endured. In one in October, thieves stole 
$10,000 worth of guns and electronics, he said.

But Shaeffel insisted that her brother had no 
need to turn to burglary, as he made good money working for their 
father's tree-trimming business.

She added that her cousin, who had undergone treatment for substance abuse, could have been after pills from the home.

'Yes, she had an addiction problem and stuff, but that doesn't mean she 
deserves to get murdered at 18 years old,' Shaeffel said. 'I understand 
they came there to rob them, or whatever, but shoot them in the shoulder
and call the cops.'

On the Facebook page, friends agreed that the shootings were too severe.

'It doesn't matter what they
were or weren't doing there,' Mike Boulley wrote. 'They were KIDS that didn't deserve to die.
Defending your property against armed burglars is one thing, gunning 
down two unarmed teenagers is just inexcusable.'

Support: Friends on a memorial Facebook page have asked whether the appropriate force was used

Logan Ayres added: 'It's hard to see 
such nice people lose their lives to something that could of been so 
easily taken care of instead of murder. R.I.P. nick and halie (sic) you will 
be dearly missed.'

Smith, 64, is currently being held on $2million bail.

According to his friends, Smith said 
that he had didn’t go to police immediately after the shooting because 
he panicked about the deaths.

'He
was very traumatized by what had occurred and didn’t know who to call 
or what to do and that is very sad that the whole thing even happened,' 
Kathy Lange told KSTP-TV.

His brother, Bruce Smith, said that this was the latest of eight burglaries he had suffered in recent years.

Byron Smith said that he suspected that the two had been responsible for at least some of those past robberies.

Neighbors told the Star Tribune he kept
to himself, but they complained that he regularly shot guns on his 
property and said they were concerned children playing nearby could be 
hurt.
