Alastair Cook was said to be devastated on Saturday over his sacking as one-day captain just two months before the World Cup but England insist he simply is not worth his place in the one-day team any longer.

England wielded the axe in ruthless fashion on the man they have put such faith in at the end of a dismal seven-match tour of Sri Lanka where his highest score was just 34.

Now they have turned to Eoin Morgan, himself in worse form than Cook during 2014, to somehow spearhead a challenge for a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand that England will start as rank outsiders.

Cook took the decision badly when Paul Downton, the managing director, and national selector James Whitaker visited his Buckinghamshire home late Friday afternoon to deliver the news.

The man who was charged with leading England’s new era in the bitter fall-out of their Ashes shambles was unceremoniously dumped even though there were repeated public reassurances that he would take them to the World Cup.

The scale of his feeling was revealed in the ECB’s confirmation of the news on Saturday that broke on Friday when Cook said: ‘I am gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment. That said I wish Peter Moores, Eoin Morgan and the lads all the best for the World Cup. I would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me as one-day captain.’

There was no attempt to mask the extent of the blow to Cook at Lord’s on Saturday from the men who have backed him but now sacked him. ‘Of course he’s upset,’ said Downton, who only on Monday had said he would be ‘very surprised’ if England had a new captain for the World Cup. ‘Gutted was the word he used. He had a dream to lead England at the World Cup and it’s been taken away from him a month from its fulfilment.

Snatching Cook's captaincy away was not a brave decision... the selectors should be red-faced  

‘He still believes he’s the right man for the job but the selectors had to make a decision in the best interests of English cricket. He’s very raw and of course it’s a blow to have the captaincy taken away from you.

‘He’s hugely, hugely disappointed but hopefully in time he will reflect that he wasn’t scoring runs and he was putting himself under an awful lot of pressure. We want him to free up his mind and focus on Test cricket which is what he does best anyway. I hope he’ll come round to thinking this is the best thing for him and English cricket and will get back to scoring centuries in Test matches.’

Downton, who has endured a turbulent first year in office at the head of England cricket, sat in on Friday’s long selection meeting but was adamant that a decision which was shocking in its timing was made only by the selectors.

‘We had to have a full discussion and weigh up current and historical form,’ said Whitaker, who made the decision on Friday with fellow selectors Mick Newell and Angus Fraser as well as coach Peter Moores. ‘Everything went into the discussion and we gave it our full attention for a number of hours. It was a long meeting but it was felt unanimously that we had to change because Alastair was no longer in the sort of form he is capable of. He wasn’t in our best 15.’

Whitaker insisted that the selectors were happy with the presence of the man who is in effect their boss at their meeting. ‘we’re perfectly comfortable with it. I feel we’ve got a group of integral people on the selection panel who will give honest opinions regardless of whether Paul’s there or not. We speak our minds in front of him just the same as if he wasn’t there. We appreciate his input when we ask him for it.’

The statistics might suggest that Cook is no longer worth his place in the side but such has been the level of support for Cook that the timing of his one-day demise must be an acute embarrassment. Not so, says Downton.

‘Embarrassment doesn’t come into this,’ he insisted. ‘This is not about personalities. It is always about what’s best for English cricket.

‘It was very clear to my mind and others that Alastair during the Test summer was absolutely the captain to back. It’s always been more debatable in one-day cricket. It’s not about embarrassment. It’s about looking at the facts and doing what’s right, or what we hope is right. I’m not embarrassed.’

Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook 

But less than a week ago you were backing Cook to the hilt? ‘My job in this role is to support our team and our captain,’ said Downton. ‘We had one game left to play when I said that and we couldn’t predict the outcome so for me to be questioning Alastair going into the last game would have been wrong.

‘But plans have to change if they’re not working and while it wasn’t my decision I completely endorse what the selectors have done because I think it gives us the best chance going into the World Cup.’

Morgan is a good friend of Kevin Pietersen and the England outcast was quick to tweet on Friday that he hoped he could play under him. But clearly there is no chance of that happening.

‘No, no, no,’ said whitaker when asked whether this move opens the door to Pietersen. ‘The ECB management made this decision in January and it is the same decision now. There is no way that Kevin Pietersen will ever get back into an England team. He’s no longer part of England cricket.’

And Downton added: ‘We parted company with Kevin in January because throughout the ECB management, from the dressing room up to the board, it was felt that it was the right decision to go in a slightly different direction.

‘If anything more bridges have been burnt by Kevin’s book. There is no interest from our point of view in going backwards. We’ve got an exciting group of young players and Eoin’s excited to be working with those guys. He wants to fulfil that team’s potential.’

The odds, though, have to be against Morgan breaking England’s long World Cup duck with a squad, revealed in its entirety by Saturday's Daily Mail, that includes the recalled Gary Ballance but not Ben Stokes, who was left out after his own miserable run of form.

Sportsmail understands Joe Root was considered before England plumped for Morgan and Whitaker added: ‘Morgan has had captaincy experience and when he has captained England it’s generally brought the best out of him.

‘It’s our feeling that the characteristic of his leadership style coupled with his determination will help galvanise the one-day team and set a course for us through the World Cup. We help he sets a course in one-day cricket that will be very positive. He’s got a lot of qualities. His form was talked about and reviewed, as everybody’s is, but we felt he could be stimulated by this. We feel he’s the right man to take us forward.’

England supporters can only cross their fingers and hope that he is right.
