Raheem Sterling will miss England's final warm-up game against Honduras on Saturday after he was sent off during the draw with Ecuador in Miami.

The Liverpool forward saw red with 11 minutes remaining after a wild sliding tackle on Manchester United counterpart Antonio Valencia sparked a late brawl.

Substitute Sterling had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes before launching into a flying challenge near the touchline which won him the ball - but took Valencia out afterwards.

The angered Ecuador captain responded by jumping to his feet and grabbing the England winger’s neck, before the pair were split up.

Sterling's absence against Honduras means he will struggle to force his way into Roy Hodgson's starting line-up for England's opening game of the World Cup against Italy on June 14.

Valencia, who suffered an horrific leg break four years ago after a challenge from Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot when playing for United in the Champions League, apologised to his team-mates and coach Reinaldo Rueda after the game.

'I am sorry for the fight with Sterling,' said Valencia. 'I apologised to the team after the match and the coach.'

Team-mate Segundo Castillo nearly missed out on Ecuador’s World Cup squad because of a knee injury he sustained against Mexico.

Valencia reacted so aggressively against Sterling because he feared the Liverpool winger could have ended his World Cup prospects.

'When he (Sterling) tackled me I thought about Segundo Castillo,' Valencia said. 'He nearly missed the World Cup because of injury and I feared I would too, but thankfully I am OK.'

Hodgson later spoke of his 'disappointment' after the duo were given their marching orders.

'I'm disappointed,' he said. 'I thought it was a fierce challenge from young Raheem, not a foul challenge. He played the ball and accelerated into the ball.

'I'm disappointed with Antonio's reaction, grabbing the player. Had he not jumped up there wouldn't have been a problem but, when he does that, the referee had to deal with that and sent Raheem off. I'm pleased Raheem didn't react to a lot of people milling around him.

'Jack had been on the receiving end a few minutes early from a very similar challenge from an Ecuadorian player and did not react.'
