Radamel Falcao's agent Jorge Mendes has reiterated that his client would be better off at Manchester United under former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

The Colombia international has managed only four goals in 16 Premier League appearances since arriving at Old Trafford on an expensive loan deal in the summer.

In a swipe at Louis van Gaal, super agent Mendes claims he misses Ferguson and insists Falcao would score in 'almost every game' if he was allowed to complete 90minutes more often.

'Falcao is a champion. At Manchester, I miss Ferguson because he is Manchester United and he has given a lot to this club. With Ferguson and this same squad the situation would be different,' Mendes told ESPN.

'I feel sorry with myself because I know Falcao and I know that if he is handed five consecutive full games, I am convinced he will score in almost every game. Because he is very good. 

'Recently he was being the best player of the match and after 70 minutes... there are things I don't want to discuss further.'

The 28-year-old has only completed 90minutes in three league games, casting uncertainty over whether United will choose to make his loan deal permanent in a £43million deal.

Nonetheless, Mendes, who includes Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea in his stable of players, insists Falcao  will play for one of the world's best clubs should United decide not to sign him permanently.

'Falcao will find his way. If next season he doesn't stay at Manchester, he will be in one of the top five or six best teams in the world,' he said.

It is understood that Mendes is referring to lingering interest from the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus who have both been previously linked with the forward.
