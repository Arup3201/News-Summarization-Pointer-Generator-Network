A British holidaymaker has been awarded nearly £3,000 in compensation after she was diagnosed with salmonella following her all-inclusive stay at a Tunisian resort.

Julie Roberts, from Walsall in West Midlands, fell ill on the final day of her two-week trip to the Dessole Riviera Resort in Port El Kantaoui in July and August of 2013.

It was supposed to be a relaxing getaway with her mother and sister, but it turned into a ‘nightmare’ as she suffered stomach cramps, unusual bowel movements and severe diarrhoea.

Mrs Roberts said she and her mother, Christine Hartshorn, and sister, Joanna Wright, only ate at the resort and did not visit any local restaurants or bars.

At the hotel they were supplied with bottled water and did not have any cause for concern, she said.

The 32-year-old said she generally consumed ‘egg, tomato and cheese on toast for breakfast, chicken with salad or pasta at lunch time and meat, vegetables and potato for dinner’.

After falling ill shortly before she was scheduled to travel home, she chose not to report her illness to anyone at the resort.

She added: ‘I was worried they wouldn’t let me travel. There was no rep available and I was desperate to get home, feeling so unwell.’

When she returned to the UK she sought medical attention from her GP, who confirmed she contracted salmonella, a foodborne illness that occurs when a person consumes contaminated products such as raw or lightly-cooked eggs or undercooked poultry.

Mrs Roberts, who booked with Airtours, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook, hired solicitors from Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors, to investigate the source of her illness and pursue a claim against the tour operator, which resulted in her being awarded £2,685 in compensation.

Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘We were saddened to hear that what was planned as a relaxing time to grieve for a loved one was spoilt by Mrs Robert’s illness.

‘Salmonella infections can be very serious and in some cases complications can arise. Hospital treatment may be required due to dehydration.

‘We hope that Thomas Cook and the hotel management carried out investigations into food handling and hygiene practices in order to ensure that that there no further cases of illness arise.’

Mrs Roberts’ mother and sister did not experience any symptoms, but other holidaymakers were reportedly ill at the resort, according to the law firm.

In a statement, a Thomas Cook spokesman said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mrs Roberts fell ill while on holiday at the Riviera Resort in Tunisia in summer 2013. We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with her legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved.

'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.

'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'
