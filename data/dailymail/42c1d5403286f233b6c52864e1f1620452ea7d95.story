Home buyers will be paying an average of £7,500 in stamp duty within two years if the current house price surge continues, it is claimed.

The recent property price boom has delivered a huge windfall for the Treasury and the Chancellor George Osborne in terms of income from the controversial property tax.

Research suggests that the failure to raise the thresholds at which stamp duty applies in line with rising prices means the Government made an extra £4.7billion from home buyers in 2012-13 alone.

Home buyers will be paying an average of £7,500 in stamp duty within two years it is believed

It seems the Government is keen to keep picking the pockets of buyers with no plans to revise the tax on buying a home, despite claims the current system is warping the market.

The struggle to find the money to pay stamp duty is putting a huge burden on home buyers, who are facing other big bills, such as raising a deposit, funding legal and removal costs.

Research by estate agents Haart (correct) suggests the UK average house price will rise above £250,000 by the end of 2016, which is the threshold for stamp duty to rise from one per cent to three per cent.

Currently, a house selling for £250,000 attracts stamp duty at one per cent, which works out at £2,500, however this rises to £7,500 once the price hits £250,001.

Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just one per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more.

Now it is charged at one per cent on properties between £125,000 and £250,000, three per cent up to £500,000, four per cent at £500,000-£1,000,000, five per cent at £1,000,001-£2,000,000, and seven per cent above £2,000,001.

The Institute of Economic Affairs slammed stamp duty as ‘a bad tax’ which should be ‘abolished’ by the Chancellor, or ‘at the very least’ overhauled.

Both the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Council of Mortgage Lenders think the crude thresholds should be replaced with a system similar to the income tax regime.

The Haart chief executive, Paul Smith, said: ‘If national property prices continue to increase at their current rate, the average price of a UK home will fall within the three per cent stamp duty tax bracket before the end of 2016 – which means buyers forking out at least £7,500 on top of other costs when moving home. 

‘Where a property tips over into this 3% tax band, an extra penalty of at least £5,000 is incurred on any property priced over £250,001.

‘Stamp duty bands have not moved upwards in line with house price inflation, a fact that successive Governments have benefited from to the tune of £4.7 billion for 2012/2013. 

‘First-time buyers, who pay an average £154,645, have no relief as they are already in the one per cent stamp duty band.’ 

A second survey published by the Rightmove property website today (mon) raises the predicted price rise for 2014 to eight per cent.

Rightmove estimates house prices will continue to rise despite measures introduced by the Bank of England last month to curb prices such as new caps on high loan-to-income value loans and stronger affordability ‘stress tests’ for borrowers.

Earlier this week the Office for National Statistics said house prices in London had risen at a record annual rate of 20.1per cent while they were up 10.5per cent across the UK.

Rightmove said the Government’s Help to Buy scheme had not only encouraged first-time buyers, but had freed up the market for richer third-time buyers who could afford larger properties.

Director at the group, Miles Shipside, said: ‘The unleashing of this more affluent group, plus good supporting acts from first-time and second-time buyers, will mean that the musical chairs of trading up and down will continue in the second half of the year having been kick-started by Help to Buy in the first half.’ 

The group also said that speeding up of housing completions, down 10 days year-on-year to 65 days had brought more sellers into the market.

The housing website also added that the London ripple effect, which pushes up the prices of properties around the capital, continued unabated because of the shortage of suitable housing stock.

The firm added it was seeing the beginnings of the same London ripple effect around large northern cities such as Manchester, Leeds, York and Liverpool.

A third study published by the Post Office suggests the average cost of moving one rung up the property ladders is more than £100,000.
