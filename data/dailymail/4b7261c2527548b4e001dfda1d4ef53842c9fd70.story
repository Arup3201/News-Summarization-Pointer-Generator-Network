After a post-match chat, Mourinho is seen shaking hands with Abramovich and Arkadiy before giving Tenenbaum a hug as they make their separate ways.

The Portuguese boss was also spotted in discussion with Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil shortly after the game. 

Mourinho signed Ozil from Werder Bremen when he was in charge of Real Madrid and spent three years coaching the German international.

The sight will likely rile many Arsenal fans, especially considering Mourinho's persistent baiting of their manager Arsene Wenger.

The incident was reminiscent of one Andre Santos was involved in two seasons ago. 

The Brazilian hugged and swapped shirts with Robin van Persie at half-time at Old Trafford after the former Arsenal captain scored against them for Manchester United.

Chelsea's win takes them five points clear at the top of the Premier League table while Arsenal have slipped to eighth.
