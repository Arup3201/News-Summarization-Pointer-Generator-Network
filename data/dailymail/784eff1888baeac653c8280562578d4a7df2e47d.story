It looks like a scene from science fiction. Gored by the claws of the beast, the man's body tenses in terror.

A smirk crosses the face of the green monster as its red eyes gleam at the sight of its prey.

But looking closer, the victim is smiling. This isn't this man's vivid nightmares come to life - it's art.

Yeouch! But thankfully it's just a 3D painting and not an actual monster pulling this man into the front seat of his car at an exhibition in Hanyang in China's Hubei Province

The jaws of danger have never been safer, as this man found at the 3D Fantasy Art museum

The monster moment is one of the interactive paintings on display at China's new 3D Fantasy Art Museum.

The artworks appear to jump out from the walls, allowing visitors to become part of the floorshow themselves.

They range from scary monsters and hungry dinosaurs bearing down from their frames to the more lighthearted pieces, such as a toilet you can stick your head through for the flushed look.

The museum has opened within the Wuhan City Hanyang cultural industry park complex in Hubei province and visitors can immerse themselves in optical illusions until September.

It is the latest show in China to embrace the idea of getting visitors inside the art instead of keeping them as far away as possible.

Last year, Hangzhou Peace International 
Exhibition and Conference Center let people find themselves in the mouth of a lion at an exhibition by South Korean artists.
