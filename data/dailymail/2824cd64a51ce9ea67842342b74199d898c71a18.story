Tiger Woods' half-brother has been arrested after making a bomb threat against the office building where he works in Phoenix, Arizona.

Earl Dennison Woods Jr., one of Tiger's two older half-brothers, reportedly called in the bomb threat against the Arizona Department of Economic Security on Thursday.

The 58-year-old admitted to building management that he was the one who called in the threat but said that it was a joke.

The building was evacuated and searched regardless and no harmful materials were found.

Police told The Arizona Republic that Woods made the call shortly before 8.30am and said that he was going to blow up the building.

Woods later repeated his claims to 
police, saying that he was the unidentified caller who threatened the 
office earlier that day.

He was charged with one count of using an electronic device to threaten, terrify or harass.

Daddy's girl: Cheyenne Woods, Earl's daughter, is now a member of the LPGA tour

He was released from Maricopa County jail Thursday evening and stuck to his story when questioned by a local Fox 10 reporter.

'It was a joke, man. I was joking with co-workers,' Woods said to the reporter.

While Earl may work in the security field as opposed to sports like his famous younger half-sibling, his daughter is also becoming a well-known name on the golf circuit.

His 23-year-old daughter Cheyenne is now a professional golfer after joining the LPGA and qualifying in the 2012 U.S. Women's Open.

Earl raised Cheyenne in Arizona, where the warm temperatures allowed for a long playing season, before she went to college at Wake Forest in North Carolina.

She got the same start as her famous uncle as it was her grandfather, Earl Woods Sr, who was the first to put a golf club in her hands when she was an infant.

She was just 19 months old when her mother, Susan, pushed her around Riviera Country Club in a stroller while uncle Tiger, then 16, made his PGA Tour debut.

Woods then started playing competitive at age eight and went on to win more than 30 amateur tournaments, winning the 2011 Atlantic Coast Conference championship title.

'It's something that I always wanted to do since I was five years old and I started playing golf,' she said. 'Watching Tiger play as I grew up, I knew I wanted to get out (on tour) some day.'
