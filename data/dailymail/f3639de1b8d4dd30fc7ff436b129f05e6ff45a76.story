A Chinese man that fought a 10 year legal battle against property developers has been left marooned after they surrounded him with a water filled moat.

Zhuang Longdi refused move out and make way for a luxury homes project

The developers deny they have been trying to force the 75-year-old, and his family to move out of their home in Pangyang village, Jiangsu province, east China.

New feature: Developers surrounded the house with a moat to make it look better for the apartment block residents

Development: 75-year-old Zhuang Longdi refused to move to make way for more luxury flats

Property firm spokesman Lu Hun said: 'His house is a mess, we had complaints, so we made it into an island to make it more pleasant to look at.

'All the other villagers sold up and left, but he decided to stay and we had to do something.'

In order to get in and out of the property Zhuang and his family have to wade through waist deep water.

Leave: Mr Longdi and his family may move house now because he said that he is ashamed of his shabby home

Struggle: His family are forced to navigate the moat every time they want to go out or return to their home

Ironically Zhuang is now thinking of moving, not because of the pressure from developers, or the money they offered, or even the moat.

He said: 'The worst thing is there are all these high-grade villas everywhere, but I am still living in this shabby house, and I am ashamed.

'I am now talking again about a move.'
