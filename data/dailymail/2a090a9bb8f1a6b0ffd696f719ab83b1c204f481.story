A hunter in New Zealand proves just how remarkably the Himalayan tahr can blend into their environment in a video filmed while out on a shoot.

At first, the opening moments of Brett Langford's short piece of footage looks like an unimpressive rocky hillside but it soon becomes an optical illusion of sorts.

When a shot is fired into grey rock the objects that looked like brown boulders turn out to be the very much alive tahr, which rise quickly and disappear down the slope.

The tahr, large goat-like animals originally from the mountain ranges of India and Nepal, were introduced to New Zealand by European settlers for sport hunting. 

They have thrived in the landscape to such an extent that their numbers are now culled, the New Zealand's Department of Conservation say, to 'control numbers in critical sites of high conservation value'.

'Tahr are popular with recreational and tourist hunters,' says . 'Their horns – and sometimes the male’s striking mane – are sought-after trophies. Tahr are generally found in the alpine grassland zone, where they graze on snow tussocks, alpine herbs and sub-alpine shrubland plants.'

The tahr are most prevalent in the alps of the South Island, between the Rakaia and Whitcombe valleys in the north near Christchurch to Lake Hawea in the rugged south near extreme sports mecca Queenstown.

Tourists are welcome to join tahr hunts year-round with the appropriate permits, with the feral range for the species accounting for about 1.7 million hectares of the central South Island.

The West Coast Tai Poutini has 47 areas where tahr hunting is permitted, while the Canterbury region in the east of the island has 12 areas. The popularity of the Haast area above Mount Aspiring National Park means a ballot is conducted to ensure it isn't crowded with hunters.
