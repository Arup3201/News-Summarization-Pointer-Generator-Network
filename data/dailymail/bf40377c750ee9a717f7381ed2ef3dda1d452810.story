As US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson beavers away on his potential Ryder Cup pairings, it is the combination of bad luck and bad judgement that is threatening to undermine his prospects.

This week the PGA Tour season draws to a close with the FedEx Cup finale in Atlanta and the feelgood factor should be overpowering since two young American thrusters presently sit one and two in the race for the £6.2million bonus.

Both have just completed outstanding victories, showing exactly the sort of composure under pressure that would make them ideal for Gleneagles. Trouble is, neither of them will be there.

Unlucky: 2008 skipper Paul Azinger thinks Chris Kirk was unlucky to miss out 

Watson overlooking Chris Kirk in favour of Webb Simpson is looking a bigger mistake with each passing day, while Billy Horschel’s emergence a week late for wild card consideration is indicative of the sort of misfortune America can ill afford.

The expressive Horschel, precisely the sort of passionate character who thrives at a Ryder Cup, summed it up well after his fine victory at the BMW Championship on Sunday.

‘Tom won’t be kicking himself for not picking me but he will probably be wanting to kick me for not playing like this a little earlier,’ said the 27-year-old.

The turn of events has left America’s last winning Ryder Cup captain feeling distinctly uneasy. ‘I would have picked Chris over Webb, certainly,’ said Paul Azinger, skipper in 2008.

‘Chris has won twice this year, he’s hot and I like hot players. Why not pick a rookie? It’s OK picking experience if you’re European but so often with us it’s losing experience.’

Late charge: Billy Horschel missed out despite his excellent recent form, including winning the BWM Championship

Just to complete the picture, Phil Mickelson will turn up at Gleneagles and find the first questions will be about his PR gaffe of walking out of the BMW at the halfway stage.

His playing partner Keegan Bradley also dropped out. He was given the all-clear regarding a rules decision by the PGA Tour’s chief referee and still decided it wasn’t enough to settle his state of mind.

His bizarre withdrawal cost him his place among the top 30 this week.

Actually, there will only be 29 in attendance. The man who finished 30th was Dustin Johnson, and his absence is just one more sorry aspect of a team in a palpable state of disarray, with the Ryder Cup now only a fortnight away.

Out of contention: Keegan Bradley also dropped out of the BMW Championship 

The first major occasion to take place in Scotland after the independence referendum will be the Ryder Cup. And, now there is the distinct possibility of a ‘Yes’ vote, it is intriguing to wonder what impact, if any, it would have on the event or the atmosphere. 

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, a keen golfer and high-profile supporter of the Ryder Cup, will be prominent anyway, but imagine if he is empowered with the mandate he seeks? 

One thing that must be running through the mind of Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley — if Scotland is awash with patriotic fervour, it might be a smart move to send Stephen Gallacher out in the opening series of matches.

No surprise to see rabid sports fan Rory McIlroy take in the home opener for the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium on Sunday night. After his recent experience at Old Trafford, it must have been nice for him to see the home team win for a change.

What was noticeable watching the match on television, though, was how often the cameras cut to McIlroy, who was given tickets by the Broncos’ star quarterback, Peyton Manning.

He was shown signing autographs before the match and then profiled at least three times thereafter.

If ever proof was needed he is now a worldwide, A-list sporting superstar, this was surely it.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK 

'What a week. I got to drive some sweet cars at the BMW and not I'm off to Atlanta. It just means the world to me.' 

American Morgan Hoffman started the FedEx Cup play-offs in 124th place out of the 125 qualifiers. Now, after shooting 62 and 63 at the weekend, he is one of 29 who will contest the finale in Atlanta and is exempt from the Masters, the US Open and the Open next year. Sweet indeed.
