Jailed: Joaquin Rabasco was jailed for 18 months after posting an animation showing 20 ways to kill a woman online

A politician who posted a video on his local party's website detailing 20 gruesome ways to end a woman's life has been jailed for 18 months.

Joaquín Rabasco was found guilty of uploading the sick animation - which included a woman dying while riding her bike, in the lava of a volcano and being chopped into pieces by an industrial fan.

A judge in Mallorca, Spain, yesterday said the 60-year-old had promoted 'clearly contemptuous images of women' which tried to demonstrate 'the uselessness of women'.

Rabasco, also a former policeman, was fined €18,000 for inciting gender violence. His secretary Claudia Falleman was handed the same sentence.

The court heard that the cartoons were uploaded in 2005 and remained online for more than two months.

Judge Francisco José Pérez said the pair deserved such harsh sentences because the uploading of the animation was 'of such gravity'.

Diario de Mallorca reported he said it 'presented women as banal, whose death was funny and whose intelligence is so low that they will do nothing to try to save their lives.'

The animation, called The Naked Woman, showed 20 ways to end the life of a woman riding a bicycle.

The character was nude, and drawn with oversized breasts.

The running 'joke' of the video, the newspaper reported, was that her breasts were so big she could not see over the top of them.

Other ways the character met her death included running over a dog that split in two and resulted in them both dying, cycling over broken glass and being caught in a trap meant for tigers.

Joaquin Rabasco was a councillor in Llucmajor, Mallorca

The judge added in his 100 page sentencing report: 'The spread of animations like the one in question does not encourage or contribute anything to placing men and women on equal terms, which is exactly what they are.'

Rabasco was a councillor for the area of Llucmajor in an alliance between the ASI (Independent Social Action) group, and the conservative Popular Party.  

El Pais newspaper reports he already had a criminal record after being sentenced to two years in jail for corruption.  

Rabasco revealed he will appeal against his latest jail sentence.
