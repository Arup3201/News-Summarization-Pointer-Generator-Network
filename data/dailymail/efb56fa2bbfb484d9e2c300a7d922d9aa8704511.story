It might not be as fragrant as evergreen but this giant beer keg Christmas tree sure taps into the festive spirit.

The Genesee Brewing Co. in Rochester, New York, spent around two weeks constructing the 23-foot-high structure out of 300 stainless steel half-barrels. 

Employees laced it  with 600 feet of green LED lighting and placed a rotating  sign bearing the company's name on top instead of an angel.

An ale lover's dream: The Genesee Brewing Co. in Rochester spent around two weeks constructing this 23-foot-high Christmas tree out of 300 stainless steel kegs - employees topped it with 600 feet of green  lights and a rotating sign bearing the company's name instead of an angel

An official public lighting ceremony is set for 5:30pm Thursday, December 18.

The keg tree was the brainchild of Kris Sirchio, the CEO of Genesee's parent company, North American Breweries.

After pitching the idea to staff, they clubbed together and bought the design to life. 

'It was a fun project, we had a ball. Everyone thinks it's cool and the whole company rallied around it,' Mike Gaesser, a Genesee Brewery employee told the Democrat and Chronicle. 

The finished construct is certainly an impressive sight and locals have been flocking to catch a glimpse of the two-story-high tree.

Alas, beer lovers, the kegs - tied together with a cable system - are empty. 

But when the tree is dismantled, the company says the kegs will return to the production line and be refilled once again. 

The festive keg tree is something new for the brewery but it plans on making it an annual tradition.
