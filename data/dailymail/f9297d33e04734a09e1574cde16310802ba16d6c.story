David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson are backing the campaign to rename the tower housing Big Ben the Elizabeth Tower, to honour the Queen’s six decades on the throne.

The Daily Mail yesterday revealed cross-party calls for Parliament to mirror a tribute bestowed in 1860 on Queen  Victoria, the only other monarch in history to mark a  Diamond Jubilee.

The square tower at the south-west end of the Palace of Westminster, previously known as The King’s Tower, was renamed The Victoria Tower to mark her long reign.

Tribute: The tower, seen looming over the Palace of Westminster from London's Westminster Bridge, was named in honour of Queen Victoria in 1860

Senior figures from all three main 
parties are calling for the Clock Tower, the official name for the tower
which houses the famous bell nicknamed Big Ben, to be called the 
Elizabeth Tower.

Around the world the 316-foot tower has become one of the most well-known symbols of London and the United Kingdom. MPs accept it will continue to be known colloquially as Big Ben, but say the tower itself should carry the present Queen’s name in perpetuity.

‘It’s a really great idea and would be a fitting tribute,’ the Prime Minister told the Mail. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said: ‘The Queen’s Diamond Jubilee is an occasion that the whole country is keen to celebrate, and Members of Parliament are no exception.

Address: The Queen last visited the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday. Above, Prince Philip looks on as she delivers her speech in Westminster Hall

'I think the idea is an excellent one and I hope the House does so.’

Labour leader Mr Miliband said: ‘I want to give my wholehearted support to this idea. It’s a great way of recognising the amazing service the Queen has given to the country.’

London Mayor Mr Johnson agreed the capital’s most celebrated landmark should be  associated with the Queen forever. He said: ‘This is an excellent way of honouring Her Majesty, who is arguably this country’s longest serving Parliamentarian, having opened Parliament 56 times at the last count and signed into law over 3,500 bills.’

Parliamentary private secretary at the Foreign Office Tobias Ellwood, the MP who proposed the idea, said he was delighted by the support. He said: ‘Victoria became the mother of the nation in the same way that the Queen has. I believe the idea of a similar tribute to the Queen will be welcomed by MPs across Parliament and people across the nation.’

Commons Leader Sir George Young will next week raise the idea with the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the running of the Commons. He added: ‘This is an imaginative and timely proposal from Tobias.’

Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: ‘Our current Queen has celebrated so many years as our successful Monarch that the idea of renaming the Clock Tower as the Elizabeth Tower is an inspired one. It will command a lot of public support and affection.’

Anti-monarchy group Republic struck the only dissenting note, saying: ‘The idea you’re going to turn a major feature of our Parliament into a tribute to an unelected, unaccountable head of state stands against everything democracy’s about.’

But Liberal Democrat grandee Sir Alan Beith, a former member of the Commission, said: ‘The Queen’s dedication for 60 years has been a tremendous support to Parliament and the constitutional monarchy.

‘She has never let us down and it would be fitting to honour her service with a landmark to British democracy.’
