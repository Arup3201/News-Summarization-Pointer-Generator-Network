A secretive hen scampered through hedges and undergrowth to find a hidden location 500 yards from her coop to lay her eggs.

The bantam hen, named Raindrop, spent the past five weeks wandering out of her pen and for every day she escaped she laid an egg in the nest.

But little did Raindrop's owners know that the hen had been sneaking through a gap in a hedge to a private nest 500 yards from her house.

The sneaky hen had been escaping to a secret location to lay her 37 eggs. Sandra Palmer's son James Palmer-Snellin pictured holding Raindrop at the farm.

Sandra Palmer only discovered the large pile of eggs stacked under a tree, when she noticed the bird was missing one day and went looking for her. She soon spotted two-year-old Raindrop on top of the stack.

After laying more than three dozen eggs, the hen tried to nest the haul in the hope that they would hatch. But because they were left out in the cold, none hatched.

Mrs Palmer, 50, co-owner of Farmer Palmer's children's activity farm near Poole, Dorset, said she was 'gobsmacked'.

Raindrop was spotted emerging from the hedge through which she was making her escape. Owner Sandra Palmer said: 'She must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we hadn't noticed'

She said: 'We have 10 hens and a cockerel who live together, but when we went to check on them one morning, Raindrop was missing.

'She must have got out through a hole in the hedge that we hadn't noticed.

'I went looking for her and found her under a tree in a field about 500 yards away.

'I was absolutely gobsmacked because she was sitting on top of 37 eggs, I couldn't believe it.

'Chickens lay around one egg per day, so we think she had been sneaking off to the tree and laying an egg for the last 37 days.

'It's her 
first year of laying and was obviously feeling broody, and by sitting on
 the eggs to incubate them she was hoping they would hatch.

'But the eggs need to be kept warm at all times for that to happen and when we felt them, they were stone cold.

'Sadly,
 we weren't able to eat them because we couldn't be sure how long they 
had been there and so we left them out for the magpies to eat.

'We
 have now put Raindrop in a separate coop so there is no risk of her 
sneaking off again where she could easily be attacked by a fox.'

Raindrop lives with 10 other hens and a cockerel but she kept disappearing to her secret second home
