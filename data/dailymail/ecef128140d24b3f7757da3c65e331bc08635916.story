Rupert Murdoch faces trouble on both sides of the Atlantic today following claims the FBI has 80,000 News Corp emails in their possession while a corporate probe into the company continues to gather pace.

According to reports, the FBI has copies of at least 80,000 emails  - all of which are said to have been taken from the servers at News Corp, Mr Murdoch's parent company, in New York.

The messages were not included in evidence submitted during the British phone hacking trial - and so could not be reported until the jury reached its verdicts, it is claimed.

The FBI are allegedly in possession of 80,000 emails taken from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp servers

Reports of the FBI emails come amid suggestion two of the mogul's former editors - Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson - were cautioned as part of a corporate probe into News UK

The collection, which is said to be held by the FBI on a single disk, is thought to include some messages sent by former CEO of News International Rebekah Brooks, The Daily Beast reports.

It is currently unknown what the messages contain - or what the FBI is planning to do with them.

A spokesman for the FBI refused to comment on today's claims when approached by MailOnline.

It is understood that many of the emails were made available to Scotland Yard's Operation Weeting as long as 16 months ago by the Bureau.

The FBI was provided with the emails after they were disclosed by News Corp to the United States Department of Justice.

It is unclear whether they were then shared with the Crown Prosecution Service or with defence lawyers.

A News Corp executive said today: 'Reports that there are new hacking allegations or newly
discovered emails are false. 

'We
voluntarily produced material to the Department of Justice more than a year ago
and we understand that material was fully available to the authorities in the
UK well before the trial.’

One report today suggested that the prosecution told the trial about their existence in April, towards the end of evidence being brought. However the emails themselves were not used.

The twist comes amid reports Mrs Brooks and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson were cautioned as part of an on-going corporate investigation into Murdoch's News UK.

According to the Independent, Mrs Brooks and Coulson were formally cautioned by Scotland Yard in May 2012 following a probe into the company - formally known as News International -  over hacking and bribing offences.

A corporate charge for News UK would have serious implications to the running of News Corp.

Mr Murdoch leaves his home this morning. The alleged corporate probe is separate to the individual hacking prosecutions this week - which saw Coulson found guilty of conspiracy to intercept voicemails

Mr Murdoch was said to be at News UK's Wapping base today for talks following the hacking trial verdict

News UK today refused to comment on the corporate charge and the allegations of cautions for Mrs Brooks and Coulson.

The alleged caution is entirely separate from the hacking trial which culminated this week with Coulson - David Cameron's former director of communications - being found guilty of conspiring to intercept voice-mails.

Coulson will be sentenced next week - as will five other former employees of the company who pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

Mrs Brooks, however, was cleared of all charges.

It has also been suggested today that Mr Murdoch himself will be questioned by the Met while in London this week. However, a spokesman for News UK categorically denied this was the case.

Ms Brooks, who was cleared of all phone hacking charges in court this week, is said to have been cautioned by Scotland Yard in May 2012

The News Corp boss was seen leaving his central London home this morning and is rumoured to have gone to the company's east London base in Wapping.

It is suggested Scotland Yard has been sitting on evidence News UK could face corporate action as far back as October 2011.

Andy Coulson was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones earlier this week. He is also said to have been cautioned by Scotland Yard

Bosses were then informed the company was under suspicion in May 2012, it is claimed.

Until that point, it is thought News Corp cooperated with police fully - a stance which changed when minutes from the Management and Standards Committee were requested.

This is thought this move led to the confirmation that the company was being investigated - and not just individuals.

Shortly afterwards, News UK lawyers are said to have met with the Met and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to argue corporate action would 'kill' the company.

Lawyers are said to have argued such action would 'not be in the public interest' as it would lead to 46,000 jobs being jeopardised.

It was around this time that Fox News and 21 Century Fox, Mr Murdoch's film and television companies, were separated from his newspaper businesses.

The Met is yet to hand over its evidence to the CPS, reports suggest.

Scotland Yard today told MailOnline they were 'not prepared to discuss' any of the allegations.

When asked whether Mr Murdoch was also facing questing, they said 'no comment'.

Labour MP Tom Watson told the Independent: 'It has now been revealed that a number of executives have been interviewed under caution, and now that the individual cases have been resolved, I am sure the Metropolitan Police will apply their customary urgency and pass their work on potential corporate charges to the CPS.'
