A mom may have saved her teenage son's life by spying on his Facebook page, as she found death threats on it and alerted police.

The concerned parent, from Salt Lake City, called the authorities when she found threats to shoot her son - who attends West High School – had been posted on his profile page.

The threats were allegedly made by two male teenagers, 16 and 17, who police arrested when they were found waiting in a car near the school on Friday.

Potential life-saver: A mother of a West High School pupil alerted police after she saw threats to her son's life had been made on his Facebook page

Police said they found a gun, loaded magazine, ammunition, cash, marijuana and a bong inside the car.

Salt Lake police detective Greg Wilking told Deseret News: ‘She [the mother] had actually read threats and seen the threat on his Facebook page. There were very specific threats that they were going to go the high school and shoot her son.

‘There was a picture of the gun on Instagram, the gun that was seized. And there were letters written on the hand that was holding the gun, and those letters were gang affiliated.’

He described the threat to the teenager’s life as ‘credible’.

The two arrested boys, who were not West High School students, have been place in juvenile detention and charged with various misdemeanours.

Police are not yet certain whether the two arrested teens were waiting to shoot the boy threatened on Facebook or what the origin of the dispute was.

Wilking said that the mother had done the right thing by alerting the authorities to the threat.
