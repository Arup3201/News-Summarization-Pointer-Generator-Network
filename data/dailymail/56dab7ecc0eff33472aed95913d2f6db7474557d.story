The parents of a 24-year-old military policeman shot dead by a civilian at Virginia's Naval Station Norfolk on Monday have opened up about their heartbreak for the first time.

While the Navy has not officially released the victim's identity, Decondi Mayo and Sharon Blair said naval officers told them on Tuesday that their son, Mark Mayo, was killed in Monday's attack.

Mayo was chief of the guard aboard the USS Mahan, a guided-missile destroyer, when a civilian gained access to the ship and disarmed a sailor. Mayo was shot as he rushed to help the sailor.

'Just put there he died a hero,' Blair said, according to Herald Mail-Media. 'He was at work. The line of duty.'

Blair said before she knew anything about the shooting, she began to feel sick.

She said her son, a Williamsport High School graduate who made a name for himself as a standout wrestler, was devoted to his family and often went to the movies with her.

Blair said her son had been a military policeman since completing special forces training in 2008 and patrolled the base.

He'd been stationed in Bahrain and Spain before patrolling the U.S. Navy base in Norfolk.

Blair said her son was born in Washington, D.C., but she moved her family to Hagerstown in 1998 for a better life.

'I wanted to do right by them,' Blair said.

USA Today reported the tragic events unfolded about 11.20pm Monday when the quarterdeck on USS Mahan noticed a civilian behaving erratically.

As several security officers confronted him, the civilian stripped the gun
 from the Petty Officer of the Watch and shot Mayo as he rushed to the scene.

A roving guard 
subsequently shot and killed the civilian, who gained access to the world's largest naval base with the proper credentials. 

According to USA Today, the shooter had a Transportation Worker Identification 
Credential, which allows maritime workers unescorted access to secure 
areas of port facilities and vessels.

The cards are commonly issued to 
truck drivers, Navy Military Sealift Command employees, merchant 
mariners and workers at a commercial port.

The civilian used the card to gain access to Pier 1, which has a separate guard who checks identification.

The cards were created after September 11, 2001, in order to strengthen security at commercial ports.

However, USA Today reported some members of Congress have criticized the cards because the biometric data stored on them is not scanned when civilians are granted access.

It is not clear what prompted the attack and if the civilian worked at the base. He has not been identified.

The Norfolk base was briefly on lockdown after the Monday night shooting but all areas aside from USS Mahan resumed operations on Tuesday. 

Blair said she would bury her son at Arlington National Cemetery, a U.S. military cemetery in Virginia.

Naval Station Norfolk covers more than 6,000 acres and is the home port for 64 ships, according to information the Navy provided in February.

About 46,000 military members and 21,000 civilian government employees and contractors are assigned to the base and its ships, according to the Navy figures.
