The 'Class of 92' are back together once more - but this time in the form of commemorative Coca Cola bottles.

Former Manchester United midfielder Phil Neville posted the picture on Instagram after being sent the image by a fan.

Sir Alex Ferguson's famous side are recreated in bottle form, all lined up next to each other.

The 37-year-old former Everton player seemed keen to reminisce about the glory days, accompanying his post with the caption: 'Class of 92 Coke!!!!!'

Neville and his team-mates graduated from United's academy and went on to enjoy great success, winning multiple Premier League titles and the Champions League.
