President Barack Obama is set to brief the media and make one final pre-vacation push for his signature health insurance overhaul, just hours after his Department of Health and Human Services took a giant step toward obliterating the 'individual mandate' that is holding Obamacare together.

HHS said Thursday night that nearly 500,000 people who have lost their medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act would qualify for a 'hardship exemption' to the individual mandate, allowing them to buy the same low-cost, bare-bones 'catastrophic' coverage plans that were previously available only for Americans under 30 years of age.

News reports have projected the number of canceled policies as closer to 15 million, but Obama administration officials insisted that number was greatly exaggerated. Insurers automatically renewed most of those plans or otherwise found them 'grandfathered,' they said, while not directly acknowledging that those renewals came at a much higher cost.

The nearly half-million Americans with hardship exemptions, however, will now have an extra year to find traditional coverage – a status that other Americans will envy, Republicans will blast and insurers already dread.

'This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,' said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry's main trade association.

Ignagni's members worry that allowing so many Americans to shift away from the gold, silver and bronze plans, and into cheaper catastrophic coverage, will upset a carefully balanced system that planned premiums in advance – possibly resulting in cost hikes for everyone else in the market.

Republicans quickly complained that if the individual mandate has already failed hundreds of thousands of Americans, the Obamacare law in general is unsustainable.

'The administration is recognizing the grim reality that more Americans have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare,' Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio said Thursday night.

'Holding a fire sale of cheap insurance is not a responsible fix for a broken program. This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.'

Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn noted that in a recent hearing, 'we asked Secretary Sebelius point-blank what would be the next "holiday surprise," and she was silent.'

'Yet, here we are with another major policy shift. The sad reality is that when the law takes effect come January 1, more Americans will be without coverage under Obamacare than one year ago.'

A group of six left-leaning senators, however, are patting themselves on the back for a job well done in suggesting a politically feasible way out for the White House.

Democrats Mark Warner, Jeanne Shaheen, Mary Landrieu, Heidi Heitkamp and Tim Kaine, and the nominally independent Angus King wrote to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Thursday, specifically asking her to carve out the exemption.

The six all face criticism in their home states, where their liberal politics put them at odds with more conservative red-state majorities.

'We are pleased that the administration appears to have responded to the concerns we’ve raised,' they said in a joint statement.  'As a result, this clarifies an option that will help those consumers who have had their plans canceled transition more smoothly into the marketplace.'

Consumers who have received dreaded cancellation letters from their health insurers and can't afford higher-priced plans, Sebelius wrote to them, 'should qualify for this temporary hardship exemption and I can assure you that the exemption will be available to them.'

'In addition to their 
existing options,' she explained, 'these individuals will also be able to buy a 
catastrophic plan to smooth their transition to coverage through the 
Marketplace.'

Americans taking advantage of the new hardship exemption will have to prove their eligibility by showing that their plans were canceled in 2013.

But the bigger picture will find the GOP, and even some liberal Obamacare defenders, arguing that offering exemption after exemption undermines the universal-coverage mandate that once upon a time made everyone subject to the same set of rules.

Hardship exemptions were already available to Americans who satisfied any of a host of conditions, including homelessness, expenses caring for sick family members, a death in the family, eviction or foreclosure, or domestic violence.

Americans claiming the domestic violence exemption are unique in that they are not expected to provide any documentation to support their claim.

The new exemption criteria requires that 'you received a notice saying that your current health insurance plan is being cancelled,and you consider the other plans available unaffordable.'
