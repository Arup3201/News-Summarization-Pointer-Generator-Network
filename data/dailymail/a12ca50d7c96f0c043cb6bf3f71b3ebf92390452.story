Alleged Colorado theater gunman had the date of his deadly rampage marked with a 'special symbol' on the calendar and a backpack that included 'serial killer game' at his apartment, investigators have revealed.

However, James Holmes' lawyers are arguing that evidence - and anything else seized at his Aurora home are admissible at trial because the initial search of the apartment was done without a warrant.

If the defense team wins the argument, prosecutors will not be able to use much of the evidence that points to Holmes' motivations and planning of the shooting that killed 12 people and wounded nearly 60 others in July 2012.

Insane? James Holmes' defense is claiming he was insane at the time of the trial and that his legal responsibility is limited

After the massacre at a midnight screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, Holmes led police to believe that his apartment was rigged with explosives and ready to blow.

They used a robot armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and a specialized shell to blast open the door. Inside, they found vats of chemicals rigged to explode.

Defense lawyers have filed a motion that claims that search was illegal. Under the 'fruit from the poisonous tree' legal theory, all evidence obtained from the apartment would be not be allowed shown to a jury.

That includes computer records that could point at Holmes' motive.

Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr. said he would 
issue written rulings on the suppression motions. A series of pretrial 
hearings involving death penalty motions are scheduled for December.

Detective Thomas Wilson testified Wednesday a page from a spiral notebook found in a backpack in Holmes' apartment contained a drawing that depicted 'a maze game ... a serial killer and a downtown Denver address.' He did not elaborate on the drawing.

He also had a Batman mask in his apartment.

The disclosure came on the final day of a series of hearings on what evidence should be admissible in the onetime neuroscience graduate student's murder trial, scheduled to begin in early February.

Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the shooting and his lawyers have described their client as mentally ill and say he was psychotic when he went on the shooting spree.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted. Public defenders have filed a flurry of pleadings seeking to have nearly all the evidence amassed against Holmes precluded from trial.

Defense lawyers said in court documents that they plan to file motions never 'litigated before in the state of Colorado' relating to capital punishment and mental illness.

Holmes underwent a court-ordered sanity examination over the summer after he invoked the insanity defense. The results have not been publicly released.
