Dallas authorities suspect a sinister plot upon finding a district attorney and his wife slain on Saturday, only months after an assistant district attorney in the same Kaufman County office was murdered.

Mike McLelland and wife Cynthia were found shot in their home near Forney, police said.

On Jan. 31, assistant district attorney Mark Hasse was also killed.

Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March and their slaying was reportedly the inspiration for the hit that Canfield tried to arrange

In January, McLelland was eulogizing assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, and authorities now suspect the killings could be connected

Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January, and had recently pursued cases involving the Aryan brotherhood

'It's a shock,' Kaufman Police Chief Chris Albaugh told reporters. 'It was a shock with Mark Hasse, and now you can just imagine the double shock and until we know what happened, I really can't confirm that it's related but you always have to assume until it's proven otherwise.'

Texas Rangers are helping with the investigation at the McLelland's home, the Dallas Morning News reported.

'Because we have to treat it as related [to the Hasse investigation], we'll be working side by side again,' Albaugh said.

Authorities were also checking on other district attorney's office employees Saturday night, and believe everyone had been accounted for

Hasse, 57, had been heavily involved in the investigation of members of the Aryan Brotherhood.

He was shot dead as he walked from his car to his county courtroom office.

He was shot multiple times by at least one gunman, police said.

The apparent assassination took place at around 8:50 a.m. in a parking lot near the courthouse where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed murder and drug cases.

Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of Mark Hasse's killing in January

Suspects: Authorities said they were searching for on suspects in Hasse's shooting but have yet to make an arrest

Authorities have yet to prove a connection the killings but are assuming one exists until evidence shows otherwise

Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said he had never seen such a case in his four decade career.

'I've
 been doing this 43 years and I have never experienced anything like 
this before,' he told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference.

Hasse was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. He was unmarried and had no children.

Witnesses
 told police they saw two suspects flee the scene in an older, silver 
Ford Taurus. However, the number of suspects had not been verified.

Kaufman Chief of Police Chris 
Aulbaugh said the shooting appeared to be targeted at Hasse for a number
 of reasons. 'The fact it was not an ongoing rampage, it was one 
individual being shot and then (the gunmen) leaving the scene,' he said.
 'It was a very small, very short confrontation.'

The
 suspects were of unknown race but were reportedly wearing all black, 
with one or both of them wearing a tactical-type vest. Some reports 
claim they were wearing masks.

Brotherhood member: James Marshall Meldrum is one of the alleged white supremecists involved in the trial Kaufman was prosecuting

No arrests have been made as yet. The Dallas County District Attorney's Office told the Dallas News  that a suspect had been arrested in the case but the Kaufman County police later said DA Craig Watkins had been mistaken.

The initial $10,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest of the gunmen has been doubled to 
$20,000 after a local business offered to match the cash offered by 
Kaufman County Crimestoppers.

Investigators are searching through Hasse's
 case files, trying to identify any potential enemies he may have had, 
including any members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang.

Shortly after the prosecutor was shot and killed, the Department of Justice put out a statement crediting the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office with helping in the investigation of two known members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang.

The gang members pleaded guilty today to racketeering charges, after Hasse's shooting.

The release states that Ben Christian
 Dillon, aka 'Tuff', of Houston, and James Marshall Meldrum, aka 'Dirty'
 both 'agreed to commit multiple acts of murder, robbery, arson, 
kidnapping and narcotics tracking' for the Aryan Brotherhood.

Tragic: Mark Hasse, pictured in older footage, was unmarried and had no children but gave everything to his job

At the time, McLelland said that the county had suffered a 
'devastating loss.' However, he said Hasse had been fully aware of
 the 
dangers of his job and 'accepted them readily'.

'When you deal with bad people on a 
regular basis, you know there's the potential for these bad people to do
 something bad to you because they have done bad things to other 
people,' he told reporters.

Hasse had no active cases dealing with the Aryan Brotherhood.

'(We're) a family not just an office,' McLelland had told reporters. 'And trust me
 the entire office took this very, very badly.

'Mark was an absolutely stellar prosecutor and good friend.'

He then appealed to anyone who had any information to come forward. 
'Anything you folks can do to help us get our hands on this scum would 
be appreciated,' he said.

Sheriff
 Byrnes said the courthouse had surveillance cameras but they were 
directed at the buildings not the parking lot so didn't capture the 
shooting or the suspects as they made their getaway.

He said his office was beefing up security for Hasse's colleagues.

'We will have a uniformed officer in the parking lot for the foreseeable future ,' he said.

McLelland added that the walk to the courthouse would be 'humbling... unhappy' now his friend was gone.

All hands on deck: ATF agents stand close to the area where an Assistant District Attorney was shot and killed on Thursday, Jan. 31, 2013 in downtown Kaufman, Texas

Lockdown: Police taped off the parking lot near the courthouse where the assistant DA was shot

But he insisted: 'We'll still show up and do the walk and send bad guys out of Kaufman County.'

Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told the Dallas News earlier today
 that he did not know what cases the assistant district attorney had 
been working on before his death but said he was not aware of any 
heightened security.

'It's a horrible situation,' Wood 
told the Dallas News. 'None of us would have ever expected anything like
 this to ever happen in our county.'

The county courthouse went into lockdown and was later closed after the shooting.

Tonya
 Radcliffe, a board member on the Kaufman County Appraisal District 
whose office is adjacent to the scene of the shooting, told NBC that a staff member heard the gunshots and called police.

Radcliffe said she and her staff of 
about 25 were in the building and under lockdown along with seven Kaufman
 Independent School District campuses.

Lawyer
 James Lee Bright, who arrived at the Kaufman courthouse just as 
officers flooded the scene, told the Dallas News that the veteran 
prosecutor had worked on numerous cases over his career that could be 
connected.

Sad day: David Byrnes, Sheriff of Kaufman County, right, bows his head as Mike McLelland, District Attorney of Kaufman County answered questions about Hasse's death, just months before he himself was murdered

'When you hear a DA at 8:40 in the morning is gunned down by two people, I think there's a reasonable presumption that it's not random,' he said.

Defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the Dallas News that he immediately feared Hasse had been targeted. 'I felt it very certainly had to be work-related,' he said.

Smenner added that Hasse parked in the same area of the courtroom parking lot each day. 'So if somebody was out to get him all they'd have to do is watch him a little bit,' he told the Dallas News.

According to CBS, Mark Hasse graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1981 and had been licensed to practice law since 1982.

The 57-year-old had been a Kaufman County District Attorney since July of 2010. He was chief of the Dallas County district attorneyâ€™s organized-crime section from 1985 until 1988.

Steinke said: 'Mark was really a great guy, 
he was the consummate prosecutor, he was hard-working, loved his job, 
and juries loved him for some reason. He wasn't very large in stature, 
but juries loved him and he exuded confidence.'

Hasse had recently bought a house in Kaufman County and was in the process of renovating it, McLelland said.

'It's a scary deal,' Dallas attorney Ted Steinke told WFAA.com regarding the role of a prosecutor. 
'Every prosecutor every once in a while gets a death threat, and we take
 them seriously, but this is the first time in 20 years that I can 
remember here in North Texas a prosecutor actually being assaulted.'
