Five horses were killed when a huge lorry overturned on a Chinese motorway.

The busy main road in Changsha, Hunan province in the south of China, was closed for five hours after the HGV carrying 60 horses to market crashed.

The driver swerved to avoid a car in front of him and the lorry flipped onto its side and the horses, standing in the back of the vehicle, were flung out onto the road. 

Crash: The horses were thrown from the lorry after the driver swerved to avoid a car in front on a busy Chinese motorway

Five of the horses died in the horrific crash and the rest of the herd galloped off down the road in panic.

Tragically, two more of the animals were killed when they were hit by cars coming the opposite way. 

Police were forced to seal off the road completely while they tried to round up the rest of the horses and put them on a new lorry.

Officers and workers found it extremely difficult to coax the terrified animals back into a lorry.

Horrific: Five horses were killed as the truck crashed and two more were hit by cars coming in the opposite direction

Frightened: Two horses huddled together in the ruins of the lorry. Police sealed the road for five hours while they dealt with the crash

Some horses were even found feasting on grass a mile away from the accident site, and police admitted that six of the horses had completely vanished.

The driver of the truck Liu Xianpeng was unhurt and was able to help out the police in rounding up the horses.

He said: 'The horses were so fast that the police drove their cars to find them and round them up, but some of the horses ran quickly and left the road. We even found several of them grazing on a lawn in a park.

'I have no idea where the other six horses went to but they were nowhere to be seen.'
