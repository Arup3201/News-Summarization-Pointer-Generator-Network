Cosmetic surgery cowboys will have ‘nowhere to hide’ when new rules to protect patients come into force, a Health Minister promised last night.

In a victory for The Mail on Sunday, Dan Poulter said ‘robust action’ would be taken against rogue operators to safeguard those who go under the knife or opt for other treatments such as Botox.

Nearly 50,000 women were affected after having faulty breast implants inserted, with many having them removed again as they ruptured more frequently (pictured)

Plans to make the £3 billion-a-year industry safer will be put before Parliament in January. They include:

Cosmetic surgeons who have long pushed for tighter controls welcomed the proposals, but cautioned: ‘The devil is in the detail.’

The plans are the Government’s official response to a Health Department review of the industry, which was led by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh.

The review was triggered by the PIP scandal, in which up to 47,000 women in Britain were fitted with the French implants made from industrial-grade silicone. The exact number is unclear because of chaotic record-keeping.

It was years before anyone spotted that the implants ruptured far more frequently than other brands. In part, the delay in identifying the link was because there was no central register.

Most women affected then found they could not sue as firms that carried out operations either folded or called in administrators.

Dr Poulter said: ‘For too long, the cosmetics industry has been completely unregulated and there are too many tales of women being exploited and of lives ruined by rogue cosmetic firms.

'This has to change, so we are taking robust action to clamp down on cosmetic cowboys to protect the public.’ He added: ‘There will be nowhere to hide.’

Sir Bruce put forward 40 recommendations to clean up the industry and Dr Poulter said the Government aims to put every one into action.

The Mail on Sunday has campaigned for improvements in five key areas, including minimum standards for cosmetic surgeons,  an end to ‘hard sell’, and full training and regulation of those administering Botox and dermal fillers.

Congratulating The Mail on Sunday for its ‘vigorous’ campaign, Dr Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the Government appeared to be acting on the first three areas, while it had not yet committed to the last two. But he warned: ‘The devil is in the detail and we wait to see the full response.’

Concerns remain about key details, such as whether the breast implant register will be compulsory.

Others remain worried Ministers will bow to industry pressure and stop short of meeting our fifth demand by ensuring all those administering Botox, fillers and laser therapy are properly trained and registered.

Many beauty therapists carry out such work and some ‘practitioners’ inject clients in their own homes.

In his review, Sir Bruce described fillers as ‘a crisis waiting to happen’.

 insisted the Government’s plans mean everyone providing such treatments
 will be regulated, but it may only be a voluntary scheme.

They also claimed several cosmetic 
firms, including Harley Medical Group, which fitted 13,900 women with 
PIP implants, had dragged their heels on changing their ways.

In
 September 2012, directors at Harley Medical Group called in 
administrators to put the company into liquidation. All legal claims 
against the firm died with it, meaning it could not be sued by 1,700 
women who had filed a class action.

The review of rules was triggered after French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) was found to be using industrial grade silicone in its implants

Directors then set up a new holding company operating from the same premises. Lawyer Mark Harvey, who is fighting for compensation, said other firms acted in a similar way.

Jan Spivey, who runs the PIP Action Campaign, said: ‘Everyone seems very keen to swiftly move on. Not enough is being done for women who still have PIP implants.’

Government policy in England remains that women who had implants privately can have them taken out on the NHS only if they have ruptured, she said. The NHS will not pay for replacements.

The Harley Medical Group said it had been the victim of a fraud by the PIP makers.

A spokesman said it could not have survived if it had not ‘restructured’ to avoid the resultant liabilities. Winding up the original company had therefore been in the best interest of patients, he said.

Sharon Little had PIP implants to boost her breasts – and self-esteem – after the birth of her children. The surgery was carried out in 2008 by Harley Medical Group.

But an MRI scan in August 2012 revealed that one implant had ruptured while the other had developed a  ‘gel bleed’. Silicone had spread to her lymph nodes.

Although she qualifies for their removal on the NHS, she is not entitled to free replacement and cannot afford the £3,500 operation. She is living in pain rather than face the disfigurement of not having new implants.

Miss Little, 31, of Cuckfield in West Sussex, said a breast implant register was urgently needed, adding: ‘These changes won’t help me or others.’
