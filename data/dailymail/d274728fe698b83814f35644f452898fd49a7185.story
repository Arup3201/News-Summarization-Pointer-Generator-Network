Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is preparing to make the first big call of the new season by leaving out England goalkeeper Joe Hart for Sunday's Community Shield clash against Arsenal.

And there could be problems for another England star as Frank Lampard’s loan deal to City may be investigated by UEFA over financial fair play issues.

Pellegrini, who won the title in his first season at City, wants to start with £6million summer signing Willy Caballero in goal at Wembley.

Safe? Joe Hart has been warned that he faces a battle to keep his place in City's starting line-up

Hart will be disappointed by his manager’s decision. The 27-year-old was dropped for two months last season after a costly mistake against Chelsea but bounced back well to reclaim his place and collect a second League title medal in three seasons.

However, Pellegrini said he regarded both Hart and Caballero, 32, as first-choice goalkeepers after signing the Argentine from his former club Malaga.

Although Hart is seen as one of the most commanding goalkeepers in Europe, Pellegrini admires Caballero’s kicking and ability to sense danger, which fits in with the defensive high line the manager wants his team to play.

Hart joined City’s pre-season tour of America late after the World Cup, though he played well as a substitute against Liverpool in New York’s Yankee Stadium.

Pellegrini last night ducked questions about his No 1, saying: ‘Why are you interested in the goalkeeper? Why don’t you ask me about centre-halves?’

Meanwhile, UEFA are expected to ask to see the full documentary details of Lampard’s loan deal from City’s sister club New York City.

The six-month arrangement was criticised last week by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a potential means for avoiding UEFA’s tough financial regulations, prompting City to respond by revealing that the Premier League club will be paying 100 per cent of Lampard’s wages while he is on loan there.
