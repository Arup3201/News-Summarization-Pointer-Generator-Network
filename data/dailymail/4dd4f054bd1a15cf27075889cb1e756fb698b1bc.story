The Duke student-turned-porn-star defended her choice to make adult films today saying that she was taking a stand for her sexuality and that she had watched porn since she was 12 years old.

'Belle Knox', 18, took questions on talk show The View on Monday after her burgeoning porn career was outed by a fellow student at the prestigious school last month.

Miriam Weeks said that making adult movies - she has starred in around 30 films so far -left her feeling empowered.

She said: 'For centuries, sex workers have been the untouchables of society. I'm sick of it, I'm taking a stand against it.'

Miriam Weeks, 18, aka porn star 'Belle Knox' is a student at Duke University. She appeared on The View on Monday to defend her choice to be an adult porn star

First porn star on The View: 'Belle Knox' said she felt like Sherri Shepherd (second from right) was judging her during her appearance on The View on Monday

The 18-year-old, whose real name is Miriam Weeks, has caused nationwide 
uproar and family heartache, was raised a devout Catholic in
 a loving home in Spokane, Washington.

Miriam’s Catholic father Kevin and 
mother Harcharan, reportedly have been ‘floored’ by their daughter’s decision to 
turn to porn to fund her $60,000-a-year education at the 
elite school.

Miss 
Weeks said today that her parents were not aware of her decision to 
enter the porn industry but are now 'absolutely supportive' of her choice.

She added: 'We tell our children through school and socialization that sexuality is bad' before adding to the shock of the panelists that she had been watching online porn alone since the age of 12.

Miss Weeks has explained that she entered the porn industry to pay for her $60,000-a-year tuition at Duke. The teenager makes around $1,000-$1,500 for each film she stars in.

When asked by Barbara Walters why she could not work at something else to help pay her way through college, she replied: 'I'm an 18-year-old without a college degree. Any other job would not have footed the bill.'

She described her career in porn as 'empowering' because it allowed her to make decisions in a 'safe, controlled environment'.

However she admitted that life at Duke has been difficult since her porn career was made public.

She said: 'I have received numerous death threats, people threatened to throw garbage on me. There are petitions online to have me expelled from Duke. It's been a hostile, unsafe, unwelcoming  environment.'

However Miss Weeks remained upbeat saying that she plans to graduate from Duke with her class and wants to become a lawyer for civil rights, particularly women's rights. She is unsure whether she will continue in her porn career after college. 

A family member told MailOnline exclusively last week that despite the shock, the teenager won't be abandoned by her parents.

Amanda
 Minor, the mother-in-law of Miriam’s brother Paul, told MailOnline: 
‘This is a tragedy in the family.  The father is one of the best human 
beings I’ve ever met. He is just back from Afghanistan; he served his 
country, how awesome is that?

‘He’s
 so proud of his daughter; there’s no way they could have known this was
 going on. It’s terrible. But they would never abandon their daughter. 
This is a nightmare what the family are going through.’

Last week, Miriam had claimed in interviews that her parents had only themselves to blame for her decision.

'The financial aid that I was given to 
pay for my tuition was insufficient and just really an enormous 
financial burden on my family,' she said.

Shocked: Dr Kevin Weeks returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan to discover his daughter was making X-rated films to fund her college studies. He and his wife Harcharan are heartbroken over what Miriam is doing

Several relatives, friends and associates of the family interviewed by MailOnline painted a picture of an extremely devoted couple who have only wanted the best for their three children, Miriam, sister Anita, 20, and brother Paul, 22.

Kevin, 54, and Harcharan, 48, were dumbfounded when they learned that their daughter was a porn actress just 24 hours before the news broke.

In their suburban home in Spokane, 250 miles east of Seattle, the couple was slowly coming to grips with their daughter’s new lifestyle.

Mr Weeks, a religious Catholic, is an esteemed doctor at the Mann Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, which deals only with war veterans. His Indian wife comes from a culture where pornography is generally vilified.

Educating their children and setting them
 on the right path meant everything to them, say family members, and 
their financial outlay on their children’s education has been 
staggering, even on Dr Weeks’s six-figure salary.

Grin and bare it: Even before emarking on her new career, sexy Miriam like to show off

All the children, including Miriam, attended Gonzaga Prep School in Spokane, a Jesuit school known for its high academic and sporting achievements. Tuition is about $11,000 a year.

It was well worth the outlay. Miriam was a straight A ‘genius’ student. She was given the ‘Spokane Scholar’ in Foreign Languages during her final school year, 2012-13.

It’s hardly surprising that out of 38,000 applicants, Miriam Weeks was one of just over 3,000 students admitted to prestigious Duke University.

A doctor of Miriam’s father’s standing would earn in excess of $200,000 a year plus deployment pay.

It’s believed that Mrs Weeks is not working right now. Putting three children through private schools and college would cost over $1 million.

As Miriam herself said in an interview with the website www.realcleareducation: ‘I have siblings in college, who are being supported by my parents, and my parents are paying $1,000 a month just for their own student loans and my dad graduated 20 years ago.

'One of my parents is recently unemployed. I was offered $13,000 in financial aid. That wasn't enough -- that's $47,000 still unaccounted for.’

The couple also recently moved to a new house on a private estate in Spokane. They bought their four-bedroom home costing $477,730, but they are burdened with a substantial mortgage of $460,607.

In all likelihood, friends conclude, the family are going through financial hardship and cut Miriam’s funding because they couldn’t afford the tuition fees and the living expenses, which total in excess of $6,000 a month.

But many who know the Weeks say that talk of them simply abandoning their child is ridiculous, which rings true considering how much Miriam backed off her initial claims of financial abandonment.

As one family member says: ‘The more interviews she did, the more the truth came out that the family didn’t cut her funding. She just said that paying such a large amount would be a strain on any family, but it’s hard to see they’d abandoned her.

‘It seems more reasonable to suspect that she didn’t tell the family the truth as to how little aid she was getting from Duke. Ironically, she may have been trying to protect them from further financial pain,’ said one source.

John Steven’s, Miriam’s agent who spoke to MailOnline, insists her family is at fault for all of this.

He says: ‘She’s not done anything wrong. Her parents have cut her off financially. In the first semester, her parents worked out a payment plan with the university for tuition of $5,000 a month. But that lasted until the month of January, and then they cut her off.

‘So starting February 1, she owed the school $5,000 a month. Where is an 18-year-old girl supposed to get that?’

Steven, who runs Matrix Models in Beverly Hills, said he had ‘Belle Knox’ booked up for four days solid of shoots in New York, Phoenix and Los Angeles during the media frenzy.

No regrets: Her agent insisted to MailOnline that she is 'level-headed, intelligent' and 'never regretted doing porn'. For now, at least

 Smackdown: Miriam smooches with a fellow porn star, a prelude of more to come in one of her racy  flicks

‘If she hadn’t done porn, she’d have 
been thrown out of school, as she would have missed the monthly 
payments. I have no idea why they cut her off, as far as I know her 
parents were running into financial problems.

‘She
 makes a lot of money from porn. She could easily make $10-15,000 a 
month, that’s for multiple shoots. She gets $1,500-2,000 per shoot, then
 I get a cut, which is less than 20 percent and then it’s taxed. It’s a 
legitimate business I run.

‘She
 simply had to make a decision whether she wanted to continue with her 
college career or drop out of school. She wants a college education, so 
had no other option. She tried to apply for government grants, 
scholarships, but the irony is that her parents make enough money so 
that she’s not eligible for anything.

'She’s
 not poor enough, but they’re not paying for her, so they’re doubly 
screwing her because she’s not viable for financial aid and they’re not 
helping her.

‘My question is that if she wants to become a lawyer and stay at Duke, what else could she possibly do?’

Steven
 says Miriam comes to LA during her breaks, or if she has a weekend off.
 She’s planning to go out to LA for the whole summer, and hopefully pay 
for the rest of her next semester.
