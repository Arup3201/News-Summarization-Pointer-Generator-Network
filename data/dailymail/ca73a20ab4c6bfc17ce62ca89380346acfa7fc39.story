An unnamed suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a string of random highway shootings that left three people wounded in the Kansas City, Missouri, area.

Investigators have looked into as many as 20 reported highway shootings as part of their investigation.

Three people have been hit with bullets, and their injuries were not life-threatening. No new shooting incidents have taken place since April 6. More details are expected at a press conference on Friday.

One woman said she was driving down the road with her three-year-old child when a figure in a ski-mask driving beside her opened fire, narrowly missing the youngster.

Witness Tom McFarlane told KMBC-TV: 'I
 was just driving down the highway and heard a loud noise. Something hit
 the car, didn't know what it was, so I pulled over at my first 
opportunity to kind of see if there was any damage and that's when I saw
 the bullet hole.'Â 

One witness claimed the shooter was wearing a ski-mask and just missed her three-year-old child who also in the car

Kansas City Police and the FBI had been offering a $7,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the unidentified suspect

Most of the shootings were reported in an area in the southern part of Kansas City known as the Grandview Triangle where three interstate highways and U.S. 50 intersect.

Local police called in help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

A $7,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the capture of the attacker. The first incident was reported to police on March 8.

Luckily, no one was killed but two victims have been hit in the legs and a third received a gunshot wound to the arm.

Jenny Baugher said: 'It's really scary to think that somebody is just out here with no regard to what could happen.'

Another victim, Ginny Bauer said she was driving a friend home when she was hit by a bullet. 'There wasn't another car in sight and we were in the right lane and hit on the right side," she said
