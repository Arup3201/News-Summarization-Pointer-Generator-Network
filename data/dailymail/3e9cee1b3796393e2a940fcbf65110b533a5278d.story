It’s widely accepted than in 5 billion years our Milky Way will collide with the nearby Andromeda galaxy - but what will happen when it does?

In a new simulation scientists have revealed the intricate process that will take place, with the two central supermassive black holes merging into one.

And the newly formed super-galaxy, dubbed ‘Milkomeda’, will also ultimately spell disaster for Earth as our planet is flung out into interstellar space.

A simulation (shown) created by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia has revealed the formation of 'Milkomeda'. This is the name given to the super-galaxy that will be created when the Milky Way and Andromeda collide in 5 billion years

The simulation was created by a number of institutions led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (Icrar) in Western Australia.

In the simulation it can be seen how the two galaxies will interact as they approach each other.

First, in a tentative meeting, they will ‘swoop’ past each other, possibly disrupting some of the orbits of stars in the arms of each spiral galaxy. 

Then, after separating, the two galaxies will accelerate towards each other again.

The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains about 300 billion stars.

This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars.

On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created.

Based on the immense gravity that would be required to explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, the centre of the Milky Way is thought to have a supermassive black hole like many other galaxies in the universe.

As Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way, with one trillion stars in the former compared to about 300 billion in the latter, it will technically be the one ‘eating’ our galaxy.

The Milky Way is also expected to ‘eat’ two nearby dwarf galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, at some point in the future.

And studies have also suggested the third largest galaxy in our Local Group, called the Triangulum Galaxy or M33, may also be involved in the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda.

In the video, gas is shown in blue and newly formed stars in red - meaning those that formed over the duration of the simulation.

‘As the galaxies come together, mutual gravity leads to gas and stars being flung out in the form of tidal arms,’ Dr Chris Power of Icrar explains.

‘The first passage does little damage to the galaxies; it's on the second and subsequent encounters that gravitational interactions have most effect, with huge clouds of gas undergoing shocks and collapsing to create bursts of star formation that lead to powerful supernovae-driven winds.

‘At late times, gas that was expelled from the galaxy falls back in and settles into a rapidly rotating compact disc.

‘Although we show only the newly formed stars, the stellar discs and bulges of the Milky Way and Andromeda will have merged to form a massive elliptical galaxy, shaped like a rugby ball.’

The data for the research was collected by the Anglo-Australian Telescope in New South Wales as part of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (Gama) survey, which involves more than 90 scientists and took more than seven years to complete.

Owing to the huge distances between stars, it’s unlikely that any two will collide.

For example, the nearest star to our own sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light years away.

If the sun were the size of a ping pong ball, Proxima Centauri would be a pea about 680 miles (1,100km) away.

With the average distance between stars being 100 billion miles (160 billion km), it’s unlikely any two will collide when the merger happens.

Nonetheless, its likely that the supermassive black hole at the centre of each galaxy will converge.

These will converge near the centre of Milkomeda, transferring additional orbital energy to stars over millions of years.

Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the super-galaxy.

Ultimately, gravity is expected to cause all the galaxies in bound groups and clusters in the universe to merge into a few super-giant galaxies like this, although it will be many billions of years before this takes place.

Is this what the collision will look like from Earth? As Andromeda approaches it will become much larger in the night sky before merging with the Milky Way. Some simulations predict that this event will see Earth brought nearer the centre of the combined galaxy before being flung out of the new super-galaxy

It's unlikely any stars will collide due to the great distances between them

Earth may ultimately be flung out of the new super-galaxy, however
