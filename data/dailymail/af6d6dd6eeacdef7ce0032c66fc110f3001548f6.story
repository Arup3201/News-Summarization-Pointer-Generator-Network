A Florida stripper hung up the phone on a cop attempting to locate her missing daughter last night so she could get back on stage.

Bobbey Jo Boucher, 29, was booked into the Pasco County jail for misdemeanor obstruction after she terminated a conversation with a police officer attempting to find her 10-year-old daughter who had been reported missing, signing off by saying: 'I have to get on stage.'

Boucher had been the last person to see her daughter when she left her alone at a nearby BBQ earlier that day to head to work at Calendar Girls strip club in Hudson.

The Smoking Gun reports that cops were initially summoned to Boucher's home when the young child's grandmother called to report her missing, saying it had been over four hours since she saw or heard from the youngster.

They quickly started pulling together information about the child and her disappearance so they could enter her in the missing child database, but when they called her mother for details she hung up before cops could get some of the necessary details.

Boucher claims she did not hang up, but was rather 'transferred to another caller who was calling her.'

The child was found unharmed around 9 pm, and an hour later her mother was picked up at the club and arrested.

She was released from custody this morning after posting a $663 bond. 

Calendar Girls advertises itself as, 'Full liquor, full nude and full touching,' on their website.
