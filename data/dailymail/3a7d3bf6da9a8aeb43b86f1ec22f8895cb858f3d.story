Michael Owen professed it would be a ‘perfect day’ if his horse Brown Panther was to triumph in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on Thursday afternoon and England’s young stallions followed up by beating Uruguay in Brazil.

But Owen has more faith in Brown Panther doing the business than England reaching the latter stages of the tournament.

‘I think Brown Panther is more likely to win than England are to reach the semi-finals,’ said Owen, ‘England’s group is very hard, it’s toss of a coin to get out of the group. If they do then maybe the quarters but then it’s a potential meeting with Spain or Brazil - and they’ll have too much.’

Owen is sending the strongest team yet from Manor House Stables to Royal Ascot this week and his beloved six-year-old Brown Panther, trained by Tom Dascombe, is the headline act.

‘We always saw him as a long term project, we didn’t over race him as a baby and now he’s doing exactly what should be in many ways. His two races this season have been exceptional. He’s in as good a form as ever and has a good chance but I keep telling myself to have a horse running in a race like this is staggering. Even if he tailed off last, he’s still the best horse I’m ever likely to own, he’s the apple of my eye.’

Owen began to plan for Manor House Stables in his mid-20’s, knowing he would require something to occupy his time after his football career had finished. It has now grown to 95 horses.

‘I see too many people finishing football then considering what next and it’s a bit too late by then,’ he said, ‘I’ve got a few businesses. Horse racing is only 10% of my life. The main focus of my life is still football, commentating and running a management company for young footballers. 

‘In many ways nurturing horses is the same as nurturing footballers. I’m interested in the mechanics of what makes someone fast, or able to run for longer or further. If I got injured it was always “Why? How? What happened to my body? How do we piece it back together and make sure it’s stronger so can’t happen again.” Horses are mammals, their muscles work identically to humans. The only thing that’s different is they cant speak.’

Owen sat on a horse for the first time last year under the instruction of his wife, Louise. He compared the pressure on jockeys at Royal Ascot to the England football team in Brazil.

‘I think 
the pressure is all relative,’ said Owen, ‘Royal Ascot is their world 
cup so it’s about how they handle it. The pressure in their mind will be
 as great as ever the same as for a footballer at the World Cup.

“But
 they can handle it because they know they can do it. Put me on a first 
tee of a golf course with 100 people watching and I’m petrified. Ask me 
to stand in front of 10mil and kick a ball straight not nervous because I
 know I can do it.’

Owen pleaded for Hodgson to be bold and play the youngsters in his squad so one of them might experience the same life changing tournament as he did in France in 1998.

‘I hope the likes of Barkley, Sterling and Lallana get a big say in it because I think they can do well,’ he said, ‘I think our strength lies in some of these young unproven players that are quick, had good seasons, are not scarred from past failures and have self belief. I can only look back to how I felt going into a World Cup. Instead of fearing who you play against as you do later on, it’s totally the opposite as a kid. You’re just thinking I’m going to score, don’t think about who you’re playing against.’

Manor House stables in Malpas, Cheshire, has recently taken on two of Sir Alex Ferguson’s horses, one of which, Red Icon, is heading to Royal Ascot. Things didn’t turn out so well for Switcharooney, the horse owned by Wayne Rooney and trained at Owen’s yard.

‘He didn’t make the grade so isn’t in training any more,’ said Owen, ‘Let’s just say he wasn’t as talented as his owner.’
