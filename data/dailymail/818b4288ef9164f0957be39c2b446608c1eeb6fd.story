His annual summer cruise of the Mediterranean appeared to be missing its usual 'harem' of devoted female followers as he set sail aboard the £50million Slipstream yacht.

But Simon Cowell couldn't seem to be without the company of the fairer sex for too long, and was joined by a bevy of bikini-clad blondes and former flame Sinitta as he kicked back on the French Riviera on Monday.

Despite being joined by a decidedly more masculine crowd as he embarked upon his month-long holiday on Sunday, the 53-year-old music mogul appeared to be back to his old ways as he enjoyed a day of jet-skiing and sunbathing with his army of female friends.

Joining the music mogul were Kelly Bergantz, who is his top female TV executive at Syco Entertainment and a close friend, as well as her sister Jamie - and the pair wasted no time in soaking up the Mediterranean sun in bikinis.

The X Factor boss appeared to be keen
to stay active as he enjoyed the first day of his summer break, using 
the opportunity to get out and about on a jet-ski.

Expertly
ripping through the waves as he meandered the area near his luxury 
yacht, the father-to-be appeared to be enjoying a spot of alone time.

As
Simon enjoyed an action-packed day out, Kelly, who married Ben 
Belldegrun in April, donned a blue 'Dubai' Melissa Odabash bikini and chatted with her lookalike sister Jamie, who was 
clad in a similar white bikini from the same designer.

While queen been Sinitta, who brought her publicist boyfriend Jason Gale, caught up with friends on board the lavish vessel.

As Sinitta joined Simon on board, she also broke her two week Twitter silence as she wrote: 'Bye Bye Blighty, take care til next time ... Ps what a "header" Van-Persie!!! Xx.'

Prior to Monday, Sinitta hadn't tweeted since July 29, with a tweet many believe was a reaction to finding out Simon was destined to become a father.

She tweeted: 'Something has just happened ..half miracle, half nightmare! #WakeMeUpIWantToGetOff!!'

It was previously reported Sinitta grew emotional at discovering Simon had fathered a child with New York socialite Lauren SIlverman, telling him 'it should have been me'.

After visiting his mother Julie in 
London last week, Simon re-emerged on the continent on Sunday as he 
prepared to board the $73million yacht for his annual month-long cruise.

Simon's 'harem' usually includes 
ex-fiancee Mezhgan Hussainy and former girlfriend and best friend Jackie
St Clair, who was reported to be shocked at his recent news that he has
fathered a child with Lauren, was not on 
board - and has not joined him on the yacht.

Simon
has rarely been seen over the past two weeks - bar an X Factor 
press conference in Los Angeles on August 1 - since it emerged his 
married lover was pregnant.

While Simon will spend the next few weeks cruising the Med, it's expected the American socialite, 36, will remain at her home in The Hamptons, New York, with estranged husband Andrew as they try to resolve their issues regarding the care and custody of their seven-year-old son.

However, sources close to Lauren have vehemently denied to TMZ.com that she is planning to uproot and move to Los Angeles to be with Cowell, insisting she will remain in New York.

The X Factor judge has chartered the $458,000-a-week 196.9 foot vessel for his winter holidays in the Caribbean and summer holidays in the Med in recent years.

Joining him last summer was Lauren and her husband Andrew, along with Simon's usual harem.The yacht features seven guest cabins and sleeps up to 13 guests, with a crew of 15 catering to their every need.

She's back! Despite reportedly being shocked by the recent news that Simon had fathered a child with New York socialite Lauren Silverman, Sinitta appeared to be well and truly back in his fold as she chilled out on the Slipstream on Monday

Earlier this month, photos taken in August 2012 emerged that appeared to show Simon and Lauren kissing on the yacht, despite her husband also being on board. Simon is said to have met up with Andrew in New York just before his flight to Europe.

Simon and Andrew secretly met with each other reportedly at the Francis S Gabreski airport in Westhampton Beach, New York, where they allegedly spent three hours clearing the air.

The summit is supposedly the first time the men had come face-to-face since the news emerged that Simon was the father of Andrew's estranged wife's love-child.

Home sweet home: Meanwhile, Sinitta didn't waste any time as she settled down to enjoy a sun-soaked holiday with her showbiz bestie once again

Simon is finalising a deal to rent Lauren a luxury apartment as she works out her divorce, from Andrew, who named Simon in the legal papers.

But he reportedly flew in from Las Vegas - where One Direction were performing on August 2 - to the small airport which is close to where Lauren has been staying with hers and Andrew's seven-year son Adam.

An airport source told The Sun on Sunday: 'There didn't seem to be any animosity, they both seemed just like normal friends.'

The 53-year-old star - who is standing by New York socialite Lauren Silverman and their child - will pay $20,000-a-month for the sprawling three-bed property in NYC.

The couple are also now discussing which of Cowell's many properties they will also share - as he already owns multi-million dollar homes in Beverly Hills and London.

Simon and Lauren are officially a couple, according to friends, and the music mogul is keen that she finalises her divorce from her property millionaire ex as quickly and peacefully as possible.

Friend Sinitta told The Sun she believes Simon will be a good father because 'he’s great with kids.'

The 'So Macho' singer – the former girlfriend of ‘The X Factor’ boss -  is confident the music mogul will live up to his title of a doting dad because he jokes around with her children, Magdalena, eight, and Zac, six, and even has the nickname 'Silly Simon.'

Speaking to The Sun newspaper, she said: 'Simon does everything naughty. I’m trying to promote eating nicely, speaking nicely, not being rude.

'He shows them food in his mouth when he’s eating and gives them loud toys to bang in the bedroom when I’m trying to sleep. He’s great with kids. He becomes a third child.'

Navigating the scene: The music mogul looked utterly at one with the sea as he expertly navigated the waves
