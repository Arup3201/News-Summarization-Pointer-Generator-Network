This elegant Belgravia townhouse was once the home, salon and workshop of royal milliner Simone Mirman and in the fifties, sixties and seventies was a regular haunt of  aristocracy, film stars, celebrities and fashion designers.

Vivien Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor and Hardy Amies were all regular visitors to the Central London townhouse and although royal protocol dictated that the milliner had to visit the Queen and Queen Mother at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House, Princess Margaret would often break the rules and turn up for secret visits to view the latest looks.

Now this piece of fashion history, which has recently been given an ultra-luxe makeover, is on the market for £14.5m.

After a major refurbishment and a new interior design scheme, 9 Chesham Place exudes the luxury and quality of its heyday

The first floor salon, once the venue for fashion shows and visits by film stars and celebrities, is now a grand double volume reception room with parquet flooring, 14 ft high ceiling and bespoke joinery

After Simone retired in 1980, the building was converted into flats. Now, following a major internal overhaul and interior design revamp, the property has been transformed back into a magnificent 4,932 sqft five-bedroom townhouse.

Paris born Simone was trained by Rose Valois, the leading Paris Milliner of the 1930s to 1950s. In her twenties she had a passionate affair with medical student Serge Mirman, who she later married, and the pair eloped to London. 

In London Simone originally worked with renowned couturier Elsa Schiaparelli before establishing her own salon at this property, 9 Chesham Place, in 1952.

On the ground floor, Simone’s shop, has been replaced by a magnificent 14 seater dining room with parquet flooring, elegant fireplace, metallic silver wallpaper and 13 ft high ceiling with bespoke chandelier

The two ground floor rooms served as a shop, with hats and headpieces displayed all around the spaces, and also up the main staircase. 

The first floor main reception room served as a salon for VIP clients. On the two floors above were workrooms for a dozen ladies who created the hats from Simone’s initial sketches. 

Finally the top floor housed a flat for Simone and Serge, with a kitchen, dining room and staff flat on the lower ground floor.

Simone’s clients included Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Vivien Leigh, Valerie Hobson, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Christian Dior, Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. 

The grand entrance hall, with its sweeping staircase that used to display Simone’s various hats and headpieces, is now a stunning showcase for luxury with marble flooring and granite-effect wallpaper

The other clients – film stars, celebrities and the cream of London society – would regularly come to 9 Chesham Place for viewings and fittings.

For major fashion events in the first floor salon, the queue outside the ground floor bathroom would often contain notables such as Vivien Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor. If only walls could speak, this house could write its own celebrity-laden biography.

In 1980 Simone closed her salon and returned to France, later retiring in 1990 to Menton in the South of France.
