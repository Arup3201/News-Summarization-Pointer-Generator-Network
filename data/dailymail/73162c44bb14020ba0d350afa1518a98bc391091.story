He was the hardman ruler of the Soviet Union's most loyal vassal state who faced off against Nato and commanded an army of a million men... but he couldn't stand to be around his wife.

East German leader Erich Honecker was so fed up in his marriage with wife Margot that he even arranged for her to go on separate foreign trips when he was away so she wouldn't be able to travel with him. 

He referred to her behind her back with the name the streets gave to her, 'the purple dragon', from the sometimes bizarre shades of colouring she used on her hair.

Public face: Erich Honecker and wife Margo, seen in their adopted home in Santiago, Chile, displayed an image of being happily married. But new files paint a very different picture

Intelligence reports collated by the BND spy service of West Germany have just been published and show that Honecker, who ruled the so-called German Democratic Republic for 28 years, had a 'difficult' marriage with his partner Margot that he eased by indulging in affairs. And so did she.

While he and his politburo preached the benefits of marriage to building a 'strong socialist state', Honecker played away when he got the chance.

Once when he was invited to Japan in 1981 he made sure his Communist brethren in then Yugoslavia invited her - she was the country's education minister - to Belgrade at the same time.

Loveless: Files reveal Erich and Margot Honecker's marriage was only held together for party and state purposes

This time it wasn't to chase the ladies but so 'I can find some peace and quiet', a file quoted Honecker as saying.

According to the files, the marriage to 
Margot was apparently 'already over by this time in all but name and was
 only being held together for party and state purposes.'

While Erich was reportedly having an 
affair with one of his co-workers, Margot was linked to one of the 
country’s top economists Guenter Mittag, according to Spiegel magazine, 
which accessed the BND files.

BND snoops painted Honecker as something of a sexual predator who particularly liked younger females and observed that the the politburo 'pressured Erich into marrying Margot in 1953 so that his frequent affairs with young girls would have an end'.

The couple only married after the birth of their daughter Sonja in 1952, which itself occurred during his first marriage to Edith Baumann.

Honecker was also quoted as saying to an aide that his wife 'exasperated' him - and he wondered if 'western leaders have this problem?'

BND transcripts also showed how he abused his position in other ways.

In December 1981, as the Cold War still 
dragged on, he took thousands of border guards and troops from front 
line Iron Curtain duty to search for a suitable hunting dog across the 
country.

Addicted to hunting, Honecker felt he was let down when foreign dignitaries joined him on his killing expeditions in the woods around Berlin because he didn't have a 'suitable hound'.

'The whole republic is being scoured for a dog,' said a BND report.

Finally a suitable pooch was found near the city of Magdeburg - 'three and-a-half years old, short haired and good tempered,' said the report.

Despite the marital upsets of the Honeckers they fled to Chile together after East Germany imploded in 1989.

Honecker would have faced trial if he stayed in a reunited Germany because of the shoot-to-kill orders he gave to the guards on the Berlin Wall.

Honecker died of liver cancer in 1994 in Chile.

The 84-year-old Margot still lives in Santiago, Chile with daughter Sonja.
