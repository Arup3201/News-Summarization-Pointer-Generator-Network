A veteran Labour MP has come under fire for claiming Ukip could not win his seat even if his party selected a 'raving alcoholic sex paedophile' as its candidate.

Austin Mitchell claimed there was 'no chance' Labour will lose Great Grimsby, where he is standing down after four decades as MP.

The seat is a key Labour target for Ukip, whose candidate accused Mr Mitchell of 'insulting' voters and taking their support for granted.

Veteran MP Austin Mitchell claimed Labour could hold his seat of Great Grimsby even if the candidate was a 'raving alcoholic sex paedophile'

In 2010, Labour won with 32.7 per cent of the vote, just ahead of the Tories on 30.5 per cent, with UKIP in fourth on 6.2 per cent. However, Victoria Ayling, who stood for the Conservatives in 2010, is now the Ukip candidate.

An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft in December put Ukip on 34 per cent, just behind Labour on 35 per cent with the Tories down to just 20 per cent.

Now Mr Mitchell has dismissed the idea that Labour is on course to lose a seat it has held since 1945.

He told The Independent on Sunday: 'There is no chance we'll lose Grimsby, even if we selected a raving alcoholic sex paedophile we wouldn't lose Grimsby.

'I don't think there is a problem in Grimsby. There will certainly be a rise in the Ukip vote now that they have a councillor and did quite well in the European elections. But when it comes down to it their vote isn't concentrated enough to win any seats.'

Labour won Great Grimsby in 2010, with the Tories in second place, but an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft in December put Ukip just one point behind

However, the remarks have been condemned for playing into the idea that Labour is taking its supporters for granted.

In October, Labour came within 617 votes of losing the Heywood and Middleton by-election to Ukip, despite the party boasting on polling day it would win with a majority of more than 3,000.

Senior Labour figures privately admit they have struggled to tackle the threat posed by Ukip on one side and the Green party on the other.

Ms Ayling, who came within 700 votes of winning the Grimsby seat for the Tories in 2010, accused Mr Mitchell of 'insulting the great people of Great Grimsby'.

She added: 'It's exactly the sort of 'take them granted' attitude that is turning people away from the establishment parties.

'Austin Mitchell has been a respected constituency MP but he's assuming that people don't think very carefully about how they vote. People do think very carefully and I don't like Mr Mitchell insulting the people of Grimsby.'

Mr Mitchell hit back on Twitter, accusing the Independent on Sunday of bad journalism

Even Labour's own candidate in the seat, Melanie Onn, said Mr Mitchell's comments were 'awful'.

Last night Mr Mitchell responded by accusing The Independent on Sunday of 'bad journalism' saying his comment was a response to an attack on Grimsby and the Labour candidate, Melanie Onn.

'Making summation of nowt,' he wrote on his Twitter feed. 'Was a response to an attack on Grimsby and Mel. Grimsby is loyal, Labour & Great.'
