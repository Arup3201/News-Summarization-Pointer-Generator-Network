Stoke City are set to secure German defender Philipp Wollscheid on a six month loan deal. The Potters can activate a buyout clause at the end of the season should they wish to. But who is the imminent new signing from Bayer Leverkusen?

Who's Philipp Wollscheid then?

At just 25 years old, Wollscheid is already something of a Bundesliga journeyman. After his breakthrough at Nuremberg, the centre back moved to Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2012. Despite a strong start at his new club, Wollscheid eventually fell out of favour, and was loaned to Mainz 05 last summer in a bid to get more playing time.

Did that not work out?

So far, Wollscheid only made five appearances for Kasper Hjulmand's side in the first half of this season, and three of those were as a substitute. That means he's only player about 200 minutes of league football since last season. Injuries have held him back, but even bad luck cannot hide the fact that he was fourth choice centre back, behind Stefan Bell, Gonzalo Jara and Niko Bungert.

So Stoke aren't getting a superstar?

Not quite. But there are similarities between Wollscheid and the Potters' star signing of the summer Bojan Krkic. Both were tipped for great things, but didn't quite make the cut for the highest level early in their careers. 

In his first season at Leverkusen, Wollscheid established himself in the starting line up, playing a full ninety minutes in 31 of the 34 Bundesliga fixtures. His form paid off, and Joachim Low nominated him for the Germany squad which toured the Americas in 2013. The tour was a bit of a disaster, and many young players like Wollscheid have not played for their country since. In the following season, Wollscheid also lost his place in Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen side.

Tell me more about the way he plays.

At 6'4, Wollscheid may come to share the nickname 'BFG' with his compatriot Per Mertesacker. Like Mertesacker, Wollscheid may be big, but he will not strike the fear of God into opposing strikers. At his best, he is a gifted all round defender, with excellent positioning and relatively secure heading and tackling. He can play with both feet, and can mark equally well man to man or zonally, although he can be prone to losses of concentration.

Will Stoke be desperate to buy him in the summer?

That depends on two things. Firstly, how well he settles, and secondly, how much faith Mark Hughes shows in him. If Wollscheid gets regular game time, he is definitely up to becoming a strong addition to Stoke's defence, and well worth his £4m price tag. If he is underused, as has been at Mainz, he may struggle to fight for his place, and will probably return to Germany.

Anything else we should know?

Wollscheid gave the nation something to laugh about when he embarrassed Sky TV presenter Jessica Kastrop. During the pre-match warm up, The defender's misplaced pass struck Kastrop in the head while she was speaking into the camera. It was the second time Kastrop had been hit by a loose ball on live TV.
