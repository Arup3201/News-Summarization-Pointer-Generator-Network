Rui Li was found murdered in the boot of a Fiat Punto in Bournemouth, Dorset. Her bigamist husband, his other wife, and son are on trial accused of her murder

A bigamist conspired with his wife and son to kill his second bride for her £300,000 life insurance policy, a court heard.

French national Pierre Legris, 61, also known as Alain Baron, is accused of killing Rui Li by hitting her over the head with a blunt implement before wrapping her body in a building sheet at the home they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, on May 23 last year.

The 44-year-old Chinese national, who moved to the UK in 2003, was found in the boot of a Fiat Punto car a week later on May 30.

Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court that Pierre Legris conspired to murder Ms Li, who worked as a nurse, with his other wife, Irene Smith, 66, and their son Jonathan Legris, 27.

He explained that the three defendants had financial difficulties and this was a potential motive for the killing.

He said that Ms Li, who drove a Porsche Boxster, had a life insurance policy worth £300,000 and also owned a property which she was trying to sell to make a profit of £100,000.

Mr Lickley said it was at this property in Wolverton Road, Bournemouth, where Pierre Legis ran a massage service which also 'on occasion' provide 'sexual services.'

The court heard that some customers, who responded to an advert on Gumtree, paid for the sexual services of Rui Li and that Pierre Legris was present and participated. 

Mr Lickley said that the defence put forward by Pierre Legris was that a 'disgruntled' customer may have followed Ms Li home and murdered her while her husband was out.

The prosecutor said that Ms Li was murdered at her home which was undergoing substantial building work.

Mr Lickley said: 'Rui Li suffered blunt force trauma, an injury to the back of her head. The blows were so forceful they were probably caused by a heavy implement, one of those blows caused a deep penetrating wound to the back of Rui Li's head.

'Such was the nature of the wound that she would have been expected to have bled extensively.

'No such heavy weapon has been found and in addition very little blood was found at the scene - it suggests a thorough clean-up has been done to prevent blood from escaping to the scene nearby.'

Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris had bought several bags of cement and added: 'It may be there was a plan to bury Rui Li under the floor of that property.'

Mr Lickley said that the victim's body was in fact placed in Pierre Legris' Ford Transit van which the following day was worked on by Jonathan Legris at the garage which was owned by his mother, Smith, and which he ran with his father.

He explained that Jonathan Legris replaced the starter motor while Ms Li's body lay in the back of the van at Cromer Motors in St Clement's Road, Bournemouth.

Mr Lickley added that the body was later transferred to a Fiat Punto, owned by Jonathan Legris and on sale at the garage, which he drove to Verwood Crescent, Bournemouth, where Ms Li was found a week after she was killed.

He said that following the killing Pierre Legris was 'cool and focused and clear in what he was doing, not rushed or in a panic, he had a plan and it involved others, his son, Jonathan Legris and his other wife Irene Smith'.

He added: 'The fact is the three of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill.'

Jonathan Legris was alleged to have driven the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside

Mr Lickley said that the day after the killing, Pierre Legris and Smith went to a dance competition in Watford and it was the following Tuesday that he reported Ms Li missing to the police after Poole Hospital where she worked had begun inquiries to her whereabouts.

Her daughter of a previous marriage, Lu Yao, 18, had also begun asking questions about her mother.

During police interview, Pierre Legris was to change his story from not knowing anything about her death to saying he had gone out and returned to find her murdered.

Mr Lickley said: 'He said he left for 40 minutes then came back to find Rui Li murdered. He told police in panic he cleaned the scene, wrapped her body as she was found, he put her into the Transit van and carried on as normal.'

Describing the financial motive for the killing, Mr Lickley said that Pierre Legris' financial affairs 'were becoming desperate' and explained the 'complicated link' between his finances and his two wives.

He said that Smith was in danger of losing her home because she owed money on the property and was unable to get a mortgage because of her age.

Pierre Legris was intending to buy the property from her and she had transferred £50,000 to his account to use as a deposit but the bank was asking questions about these funds.

Mr Lickley said that this was further complicated by the fact that Pierre Legris was due to pay £20,000 back to relatives of Ms Li in China which would have come from the deposit money which in fact belonged to Smith.

Mr Lickley said that 'animosity' between the two wives meant that 'the last thing that would have been countenance would be Rui Li helping herself to what would have been Irene Smith's money.'

Prior to the start of the trial, Legris pleaded guilty to an offence of bigamy by marrying Ms Li in 2007 while having been married to Smith since 1987. He denies murder.

Jonathan Legris and Smith deny a charge of conspiracy to murder.

Jonathan Legris, of Spring Road, Bournemouth, also denies a charge of assisting an offender by driving the Fiat Punto with Ms Li's body inside.

Smith, of St Clement's Road, also denies a charge of perverting the course of justice by providing a false alibi to Pierre Legris by saying he stayed at her home on the night of the murder.

She also denies an offence of assisting an offender by hiring a storage facility and placing her husband's clothes and French passport in it.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

The trial of Pierre Legris, Jonathan Legris and Irene Smith is taking place at Winchester Crown Court
