Find it hard to take a photo that shows your beloved pet in their best light? Dog owners know it can be nigh on impossible to get their little furry faces pointing towards the camera at the right moment. Not any more.

Dog lovers can now take perfect portraits of their pets every time thanks to a new app that barks for their attention.

BarkCam makes a variety of noises designed to make dogs look towards a smartphone's camera allowing owners to take the ideal picture with ease.

Whether it's a squeaky toy, cat's meow, a
 rusting treat bag or doorbell, the sound of choice is emitted at the 
touch of the shutter button.

London-based company Bark & Co. hope to put an end to pet owners struggling to get their pet's undivided attention.

The new app is said to be the dog version of Instagram, letting users enhance their dog photos with filters, texts, and stickers.

You can also share your photos with other dog owners via its in-built social network, or on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

BarkCam is the latest offering from Bark&Co, which also has apps for on-demand veterinary care (BarkCare) and finding adoptable pets nearby (BarkBuddy).

The company also has BarkBox, its flagship subscription service that delivers a monthly box of treats, toys and other goodies to pet owners, say Mashable.

Although BarkCam is decidedly sillier than Bark&Co's other apps, the app will likely appeal to its pet-obsessed demographic.

While the free app is only available on Appleâ€™s App Store, an Android version will be released later this year.
