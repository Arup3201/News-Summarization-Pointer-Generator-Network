The ex-wife of a mining tycoon claims she is facing homelessness - despite being hugely wealthy on paper - because her ex-husband has failed to honour a £2 million divorce payout.

Shelley Mann, 47, claims her former partner, David, agreed to 'maintain' her 'for life', but has left her hanging 'between the devil and deep blue sea'.

Since their marriage failed and he left the £1.8m family home in Hampstead in 1999, the mother-of-two says his reluctance to pay up has caused her a dramatic fall from grace.

Shelley Mann claims her ex-husband David Mann owes her £2million from a divorce settlement and that his haphazard payments to her have meant she now faces homelessness because of rent arrears

She is now threatened with life on the street as court proceedings are underway to evict her and her two daughters from their Belgravia home over £50,000 in rent arrears.

Mr Mann, 49, says he is simply unable to help as he is battling cancer and has 'run out of money'.  

Senior family judge, Lord Justice MacFarlane, heard that Mrs Mann's comfortable home life was shattered when she and her husband, who specializes in brokering mining deals, separated in 1997, then divorced two years later.

Mrs Mann was initially handed the matrimonial home in Hampstead, north London, and given 'solid' maintenance payments for her and their children as part of her divorce settlement.

Her barrister, Rex Howling, said things began to go seriously wrong when Mr Mann 'failed' to keep up mortgage payments on the house.

Mrs Mann says that forced her to sell the home in 2004 - for £1m less than it is worth today.

She was then unable to buy a new house as the legal costs of her settlement dispute mounted and she moved into a rented home with her daughters, initially in Hampstead.

However, they later moved to a 'cheaper' £6,000-a-month mews house in Belgravia, which Mr Mann paid for.

But the former couple could still not get along, and after a further decade of bitter wrangling over money, Mrs Mann says Mr Mann still owes her £2m.

Mr Howling told the judge that the Mrs Mann's troubles escalated when, in October last year, her ex-husband stopped paying the rent on her home in Belgravia. As a result she has racked up £50,000 in rent arrears.

Mrs Mann and her daughters, aged 20 and 21, are facing eviction proceedings in the coming days. 

Because they are unlikely to qualify for council assistance, they are facing life without a roof over their head, the Court of Appeal heard.

Mr Howling said: 'His ex-wife and his two daughters, who both still live at home, are being pushed out.'

He explained that, although Mr Mann is still paying his ex-wife about £4,000 a month, his 'haphazard and unpredictable payments' mean she can't get a deposit together or provide the proof of regular income necessary to get a new rented home.

Mr Howling said: 'He is giving her money on a drip feed basis, preventing her from renting anywhere else.'

'In the eyes of the local authority, the wife, in light of her rent arrears, will be classed as intentionally homeless and will be unable to seek assistance under the Housing Act.

'She is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.'

Mr Howling said Mr Mann had access to money 'it is a matter of how he wants to apply it'.

Mr Mann's lawyer, Justin Warshaw, said his client was in poor health and was also suffering financially, saying he was 'in a similarly parlous position to his former wife'.

Mr Warshaw said Mr Mann made his money through introduction fees for mining and associated deals, the last of which that netted any money was in 2013.

He said that was why Mr Mann stopped paying his ex-wife's rent.    

The barrister added that Mr Mann is living in a housing association flat and can't even afford to pay for proper cancer treatment.

He didn't attend the proceeding because he was in hospital, Lord Justice MacFarlane was told.   

Mr Warshaw argued that the 'ancient divorce' should not still be hanging over Mr Mann's head after 15 years. The amount owed to Mrs Mann is also in dispute. 

At an earlier hearing Mr Mann had been criticised for his 'poor payment record, his repeated breach of the duty of full and frank disclosure, his manipulation of the trial process and his presentation of a dishonest case,' including 'producing rather questionable medical certificates'.

Mr Howling disputed Mr Mann's claim to poverty, saying he wasn't living in local authority accommodation. 

He added that, even if Mr Mann is in trouble financially, 'there is the possibility for his wealthy friends to dig him out of a hole.'

Lord Justice MacFarlane expressed dismay at the havoc being wrought on the family by the couple's marathon divorce.

He said: 'I don't know, but I strongly suspect, what the state of affairs is in the relationship between the husband and the wife. But what of the relationship between him and his daughters?

'Situations like this do enormous damage to relationships.'

Lord Justice MacFarlane said the orders made by the court had not been honoured and 'haphazard and unpredictable' payments had caused Mrs Mann's predicament.   

He said: 'There is clearly a pressing need to try to save the housing of Mrs Mann and her daughters, because of the lack of options open to them'.

Clearing the way for Mrs Mann to take debt enforcement action against her ex, he added: 'What she needs is cash at the moment.'

Outside court, Mrs Mann described what is happening to her and her daughters as 'an awful situation.'
