Shirts and caps are usually the souvenirs one can expect to find if you were to walk into a footballer's house.

But they are clearly not enough for John Terry, who has kept every single armband he has worn over the years.

The Chelsea and former England skipper has posted a picture on Instagram of the dozens of armbands he has collected.

Terry wrote: 'Saved all of my arm bands over the years and hoping to add many more to my collection. Very Proud and Honoured.'

As well as the armbands he has worn during his 10-year spell as captain of Chelsea, the collection also includes several from his time as skipper of the national side.

Terry, 33, is the most successful captain ever at Stamford Bridge, winning three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, a Europa League and being an integral part of the squad that won the Champions League.

He recently celebrated his 500th match as Chelsea's captain, leader, legend and will be hoping to add this season's Premier League title following his side's unbeaten start to the season.
