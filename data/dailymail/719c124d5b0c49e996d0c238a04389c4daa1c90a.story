Manny Pacquiao is training harder than ever as he prepares for his $300million fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr in May.

The Filipino star posted more videos on Instagram from his Los Angeles training camp on Wednesday as he starts to spend more time in the gym in the run-up to the bout.

Pacquiao showed off his hand speed inside the ring and out, dancing about and throwing punches before working on the speed ball.

Pacquiao also posted a message for his fans as he ups the intensity with the fight just two months away. 

'Day 3 of my road work training. Thank you Lord for your grace and mercy and your love endures forever. Thank you fans have a blessed day.'

Pacquiao's coach Roach is trying to keep his man focused on the task ahead, rather than getting involved with any verbal sparring with Mayweather.

'Manny has not been in with a lot of trash-talkers,' said Roach. 'Mayweather is like Ali in the sense that he will talk to you a lot in the fight. He will rest on the ropes, chatter in your ear and try to get you out of your game.

'I'm really not sure how Manny is going to react to that. He can't let himself get distracted.'
