More than 200 people have been arrested after violent clashes broke out between hooligans and police in Warsaw.

Rocks, firecrackers and cobblestones were launched at officers amid chaotic scenes on the streets of Poland’s Capital city as the nation marked the anniversary of its independence.

The police responded by firing rubber bullet rounds into the air, and used jets of water, stained red by a colouring agent, from four water cannon trucks to push them back.
