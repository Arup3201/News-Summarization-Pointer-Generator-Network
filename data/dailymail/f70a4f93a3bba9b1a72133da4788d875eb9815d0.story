He had dreamed of serving his country as a child from a young age.

These touching pictures from the family album reveal how a cheeky toddler pictured grinning alongside his sister grew up to become brave soldier Lee Rigby.

He fought for Britain in Afghanistan where he was a machinegunner, but the serviceman was brutally killed on the streets of London.

Today his family, still coming to terms with the killing that has shocked Britain, appeared at a press conference where they said: 'We loved you so much, you didn’t deserve this'.

His two-year-old son Jack now faces growing up without a father after the killing which has shocked Britain.

The machinegunner, 25, was hacked to death in broad daylight by Islamist fanatics as he walked back to Woolwich Barracks in south-east London, where he was stationed.

The soldier grew up on the sprawling 
Langley estate in Middleton, near Rochdale, and attended nearby 
Middleton Technology School.

His wife Rebecca burst into tears as she told a press conference: 'I love Lee and always will. I am proud to be his wife and he was due to come up this weekend so we could continue our future together as a family,' Mrs Rigby said today.

'He was a devoted father to our son Jack and we will both miss him terribly.'

His parents Lyn, 46, and Phil McClure, 53, had Lee and three daughters, Sara, 24, Chelsea, 21 and Megan, before they split up.

Lyn later met and married Ian Rigby and the young man took his stepfather’s name.

The couple went on to have two daughters, Courtney, 11, and Amy, eight. 
Drummer Rigby married girlfriend Rebecca in her home village of 
Southowram, near Halifax, in 2007 and the couple had a son Jack, who is 
now two. The couple are understood to have separated.

Drummer Rigby wed Rebecca Metcalfe in 2007 and although they had become estranged, she told a press conference today they had agreed to meet this weekend to 'continue our future together as a family'.

Yesterday, as he was named as the man brutally murdered Army comrades paid tribute to 'Riggers' who they described as 'larger than life' and a 'great character'.

The soldier joined the Army in 2006 and, after completing his infantry training, was selected for the corps of drums and posted to the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, which is currently based on the island of Cyprus.

In 2009, he deployed to Helmand 
province where he was a machinegunner with the battalion’s fire support 
group in Patrol Base Woqab in Sangin, an insurgent hotspot.

His
unit arrived in the warzone at the height of the Taliban insurgency and
ran a deadly daily gauntlet of firefights and improvised explosive 
devices.

During his 
military career, the life-long Manchester United fan had proudly stood 
outside the royal palaces on ceremonial duties.

Friends and neighbours said yesterday they were devastated by the ‘shocking and appalling’ murder.

Katie
Lord, 26, who lives opposite Drummer Rigby’s mother and stepfather in 
Middleton, said: ‘I’ve known him since we were knee high and he was a 
lovely lad.

‘He wanted 
to join the Army ever since he was a kid – it was his ambition. I just 
can’t believe it. I’m in total shock – in pieces.’

Another friend, who declined to be named, said: ‘He got married to his sweetheart in such a lovely, romantic wedding.

‘He was a proud dad and family man. He was a good egg, always had time for people. We’re all just shocked and appalled.’
