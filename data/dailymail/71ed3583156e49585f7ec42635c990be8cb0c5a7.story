Manchester United will activate a one-year extension of Michael Carrick’s £130,000-a-week contract to keep the midfielder at Old Trafford beyond the summer.

Carrick agreed to the clause when he signed a two-year deal in 2013 and has expressed a wish to stay.

The midfielder, 33, has been one of their most influential players since his return from injury and it has coincided with an upturn in fortunes for the club.

Manager Louis van Gaal wants to keep Carrick at Old Trafford and United will confirm their plans in talks early in the new year.

Carrick has become one of the most important players during United’s climb into third place in the Premier League and Van Gaal is a big admirer of his qualities.

Carrick also forced his way back into the England team this year. He has won five Premier League titles since his move from Tottenham in 2006 and was United’s player of the year in 2013.

Angel di Maria is set to miss United's trip to Tottenham on Sunday with a pelvic injury

United will be without Marouane Fellaini for the remainder of the holiday period after it emerged that the Belgian has a rib injury. Van Gaal had put Fellaini’s absence from the squad down to a mystery ‘virus’.

However, it is understood Fellaini is also nursing injured ribs suffered in the win against Liverpool a fortnight ago. They are expected to sideline the former Everton player until after the FA Cup third-round tie at Yeovil a week tomorrow.

Van Gaal had better injury news about other players. Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo could travel to Yeovil, while left-back Luke Shaw is in contention for today’s Tottenham game.
