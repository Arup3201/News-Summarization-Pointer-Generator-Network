Simple measures such as staying inside and watching TV can help combat potential flu epidemics, experts have revealed.

Vaccinations and medications provide an effective form of response in the face of an outbreak.

But avoiding social activity and staying at home can help halt the spread of infectious diseases, scientists have said.

Simple measures such as staying at home during a flu pandemic can help halt spread of the virus, scientists have today revealed

A new study by a team of scientists at the University of California, Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Yale University found these non-pharmaceutical interventions can prove effective.

Whether privately initiated or policy directed, actions calling for the closure of schools and entertainment venues, and cancelling public events are becoming more relevant in control strategies.

Lead author of the study economist Michael Springborn, from the Univeristy of California, said: The swine flu outbreak that hit Mexico City in April 2009 could have been worse, but spread of the virus was reduced by people's behavioural response of distancing themselves from each other.'

The researchers created a a new model that incorporates behavioural responses into existing models of disease spread.

In April 2009 in Mexico, following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, or swine flu, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place.

Researchers looked at television viewing in the home in Central Mexico as an indicator of behavioural response, during the pandemic.

Professor Springborn said television ratings are consistently and widely available and 'highly correlate' with time spent in the home.

The data provides a good indicator for the level of social interaction, with time spent watching TV increasing with the amount of time spent in the home.

When people are at home, they limit the number of other people they come into contact with.

In March 2009 following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place

'We found that the behavioural response to the outbreak was initially strong but waned sooner than expected,' Professor Springborn said.

'This dynamic is interpreted as a rebound effect.'

At the onset of the flu outbreak, the public responded strongly to the directed control policies.

But after a period of time of staying at home, people began to leave the confines of their houses.

Professor Springborn said: 'This suggests that efforts to utilise social distancing to mitigate disease spread may have a limited window of efficacy, before pent up demand for activities outside the home takes precedence.'

The study revealed measures including using face masks can be effective at halting the spread of flu during an outbreak

In 1918 the influenza pandemic in Australia reflected that behaviour pattern.

When the perceived risk decreased, the public reverted back to normal behaviour. 

'Our study reinforces the view that capturing behavioural changes that amplify or blunt the transmission rate is key to improve our ability to make predictions about the impact of epidemics,' said co-author Dr Gerardo Chowell, from Georgia State University. 

The study's findings revealed differences in age groups and socio-economic groups.

The researchers found that the increase in television watching for children and wealthier groups was more pronounced.

The authors speculate that those from poorer backgrounds may face greater difficulty in taking self-protective measures, like social distancing, because of less flexibility with working hours.

They suggest the differences could have implications for policy makers directing responses to future outbreaks, directing more resources to help those with lower financial means.

Professor Springborn, said: 'This affects public health authorities tasked with planning epidemics.

'This has implications for management advice, including the allocation of resources between pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions.'

Other forms of non-pharmaceutical interventions include closing businesses and distributing face masks.

But people can also take personal action, washing their hands thoroughly and wearing personal face masks to help reduce transmission. 

The study was published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases.
