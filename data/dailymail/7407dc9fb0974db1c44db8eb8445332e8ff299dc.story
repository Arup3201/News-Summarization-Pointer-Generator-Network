Jan Russ was a successful casting director, known for launching the careers of people like Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kylie Minogue and Dan McPherson but she had a deep dark secret that not many people knew about.

Jan has revealed the drama that is her life, on the Australian Story, and the pain and guilt she harboured as a teenage girl.

Her tumultuous story starts in 1965 with a teenage pregnancy and how she had no say and was forced to surrender her baby girl, a decision which still haunts her today.

'Rejection and shame and guilt were the three emotions that I carried with me my whole life,' Jan said.

Jan Russ has revealed the drama that is her life, on the Australian Story, and the pain and guilt she harboured as a teenage girl when she became pregnant

She started to do local theatre shows and that's where she met a guy that she called her boyfriend, they just had sex once but it only took one time and she fell pregnant.

'I was absolutely terrified to tell my parents, I was just in a total state of shock I didn't know how to handle it, what to do, I was terrified I was scared,' she told Australian Story.

Jan hoped for a fairytale, that her boyfriend would ask her to marry him but her life was shattered when he asked to adopt her baby and didn't want to be roped in to getting married young.

'That to me was like an arrow through the heart,' said Jan.

'Your head is full of fear and guilt. It's a terrible terrible thing for a single girl to get pregnant, you were looked down on as if you were a third class girl, a bad girl, a wanted girl.'

An unthinkable situation forced her to travel to Sydney to go to an unmarried mothers home.

'He put me on the train and stood there while the train left. I always hoped he would say don't go, I didn't want anything to happen to my baby, but he didn't.'

He promised her he would write her and when the baby was born and adopted he would come back and they would again have a relationship, but that never happened.

When she got to Sydney she went to visit the unmarried mothers home, but they had no room so she was forced to stay at the YWCA for a night.

Scared and frightened, Jan considered commiting suicide and jumping out of a window but when she felt her baby kick she knew she had to 'get on with it'. 

The next morning she received a call from the unmarried mothers home and from then she was taken in by a lady called Tessa Durston.

'When I first met her she seemed desperate and then I decided that she should come and stay with us, Tessa told Australian Story.

Jan never told a soul, besides her boyfriend, about her pregnancy, but talked about adoption with Tessa.

The day of the birth, Tessa was told she wasn't allowed to be there with Jan.

Jan told of how she was taken to a ward for unmarried mothers and described her surroundings as a dreary room with terrible beds. 

'I'm in pain, on my own, I'm scared, I'm frightened, I think I'm dying and I'm screaming because I didn't know what else to do and I just wanted someone to come and give me a bit of help,' said Jan.

'I can remember this sister, very vicious sister just coming in and ripping the front curtain back and just saying shut up, you're making too much noise, just shut up.'

'I'll never forget the doctor saying to the nurses let her rip she's just one of those girls don't worry about it.'

Jan had a baby daughter. It was then she called her mother and all she said was 'I need you'.

It was September 1965, Jan's mother arrived at the hospital before calling Jan's brother, who was married.

Dillas and Bob Russ assumed she was bringing a baby for them because they had no children and they were going through fertility program.

But the baby was to be taken away without the say of Jan and given to another family to be adopted and cared for.

The night before Jan got to say goodbye, she was devastated, 'I held her all night and cried, and I told her that I loved her so much and that I always always loved her no matter what, I felt my life had been ripped apart,' she said.

Even her father, who the family thought would disapprove of the birth of the baby, wrote a letter saying it wasn't the end of the world and to just come home. 

Despite a devastating past, Jan got on with her life and thrust all her efforts into musical theatre and when she decided to give professional theatre a go, it only took one audition before she was called back to say she had a part in the production 'Oliver'. 

She became the ultimate party girl drinking and having fun and also toured New Zealand with a few shows and even worked alongside John Farnham in Charlie girl.

Then her life changed when she met her husband, Bruce, a kiwi who she fell in love with and the couple married and had a baby boy called 'Sam'.

'It was really a mixed emotion when my son was born, I was so thrilled to have him but at the whole time at the back of my mind was the birth of my daughter,' Jan told Australian Story.

She soon found her way into film and Television, on screen for several programs then finally behind the screen as a casting director for popular Aussie TV drama, Neighbours.

Jan also got the chance to travel overseas to become part of a Korean television series with her son Sam, who is a high profile TV star in South Korea.

It was a cooking show with her daughter in law and there, the tables turned for son Sam who says he always stood in the shadow of his talented mother. 

'One thing I grew up with with mum was that I was Jan Russ' son,' he told Australian Story.

'It was never Sam Hammington. I never had my own identity. Especially in the entertainment industry everything was linked to my mother.'

'She gave everything up for me, I think she still had an aspiration to tread the boards, whether it was film television or theatre but she realised that if you're an actor, you're out of work a lot of the time and being able to support a child is near impossible,' said her son Sam.
