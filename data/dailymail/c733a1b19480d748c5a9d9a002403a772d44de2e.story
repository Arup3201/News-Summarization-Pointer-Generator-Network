A 1,000lb woman, once dubbed the 'half-ton killer' after she falsely confessed to accidentally killing her nephew, has lost 800lb.

Mayra Rosales, from Texas, said she had given up on life when she decided to protect her sister Jamie and take the blame for the death of her nephew Eliseo in 2008. 

Rosales, 34, told police she had smothered the child by rolling on top of him, a claim  later disproved when autopsy results revealed the boy had died from multiple injuries to his skull.

After her sister Jamie confessed to the crime and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mayra vowed to get healthier to take care of her sister's surviving children.

Miss Rosales decided to turn her life around and since 2011 has been shedding hundreds of pounds. 

Miss Rosales lost weight with the help of 11 surgeries, including a lap band surgery and extra skin removal procedures.  

She has also changed the way she thought about food, she told ABC 13.  

'Food to me is I have to eat to live,' she said. 'Before it was living to eat, and now you know, it's just something normal.' 

Houston surgeon Dr. Younan Nowzaradan said he could see Rosales was driven to make a change.

'Once you're in bed for several years, she had no life,' he said. 'Once she get up and walk and do things, you'll be amazed how motivated people become.' 

After her trial, Rosales immediately began around the clock treatment with an obesity doctor and lost 100 pounds in her first 10 days

The newly slimmed down Rosales hasn't just seen a major change in her appearance. Her health has drastically improved as well. 

'I'm not diabetic, I do not have high cholesterol, I do not have high blood pressure,' she told ABC's Nightline. 

'Now I'm okay and my organs are perfect.' 

Rosales now has an active following on Facebook with over 18,000 fans, who she keeps updated as her transformation continues. 

Last month Rosales posted about another skin removal surgery, writing that 'my leg looks normal like any other' except for the scar she now has running from the back of her knee to her ankle. 

Rosales also invites fans who are struggling with their weight to inbox her if they'd like to receive health tips.

On her Facebook Rosales also revealed that she and her husband Bernie, was shown in her TLC documentary when she was still 1,000 pounds, had gotten a divorce in 2013 because he wanted to move back to Mexico to be with his family.

Rosales recently posted photographs smiling with a new boyfriend.

On her official Facebook page, which has over 18,000 followers, Rosales posted photographs with what appears to be a new boyfriend. She revealed on the page that she divorced her husband Bernie in 2013 

Rosales has seen a drastic improvement in her health as well. 'I'm not diabetic, I do not have high cholesterol, I do not have high blood pressure,' she said 

Although she now weighs around 200lb, Rosales said at the time of her two-year-old nephew's death she was dying.

'I was alive but not living life,' she said. 

Rosales had watched her sister hit Eliseo with a hairbrush on his arm, legs and head. The little boy died later that day from his injuries.

Jamie begged Rosales to take the fall. 

'I thought I was dying anyway so I decided to admit that I'd done it to protect my sister because I love her,' Rosales told the court during her trial. 

Rosales' trial became a media sensation. Cameras rolled as Rosales had to be cut out of her house and transported into a moving van to the court. 

Her attorney also bought a king-sized mattress so she could live in the courtroom while the jury decided her fate.   

Rosales later told ABC she was willing to give up her life for Jamie.

Instead Rosales ended up changing her life. 

She is now in the process of getting custody of Jamie's surviving children, who Rosales said are excited just to see her walking again.
