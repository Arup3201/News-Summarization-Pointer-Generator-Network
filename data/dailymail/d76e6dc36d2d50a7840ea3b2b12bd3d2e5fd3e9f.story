An Alabama man who has spent just four years on death row for the fatal suffocation and beating his infant son was put to death by lethal injection on Thursday evening.

The execution of Christopher Thomas Johnson, 39, took place at  the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.

For his last meal, Johnson had a turkey bologna sandwich with cheese and tomato, a grape Sunkist, french fries, Reeses peanut butter cups and pretzels.

Though he extended his visiting hours during his last day, his only visitor was his brother, Thomas Eugene Lagos.

Johnson made the rare move of pleading guilty to capital murder in the 2005 death of his six-month-old son Elias Ocean Johnson.

This case stands as one of the quickest death penalty case in recent memory, as it only took six years for the murderer to be put to death after the crime.

The inmate himself requested the death penalty, which was granted in February 2007, and waived all appellate and intervention measures on his behalf.

Johnson represented himself at trial. He testified he killed his son because 'he hated his wife, didn't want to be near her and didn't want to worry about her threats of putting him in jail for alimony or child support,' according to documents filed by the state Attorney General's Office.

Johnson offered no mitigating circumstances for his crime, and the trial court found the 'the heinous, atrocious and cruel' nature of the murder outweighed any justifications that could have been offered, records show.

According to court documents, Johnson tried to quiet Elias while his wife slept.

After several unsuccessful attempts in the early morning hours, he 'laid on top of Elias, covered Elias' mouth with his hand for extended periods of time, and forced his fingers into the child's mouth and down his throat to stop the crying'. 

He also struck the child with his hand.

During his trial, Johnson said that “You go see Jesus,” were the last words he said to his son.

When the child's mother awoke, Elias was unresponsive and cold to the touch.

The forensic pathologist who performed Elias' autopsy testified during the trial that the infant suffered at least 85 separate injuries.

Suffocation and head trauma were cited as the causes of death.

Johnson's ex-wife Dana spoke to a local Alabama newspaper for the first time since the murder, saying that she welcomes Christopher's death.

'Although I normally do not agree with capital punishment, I will not lose any sleep over this particular execution.  Whether it is right or wrong I  feel that a weight will be lifted from my soul on Thursday, and finally I will feel relief,' Dana said to NorthEscambia.com.

'I am scarred by this, and Christopher took away my son, my trust in other people, and even my desire to ever have another child.  I still have a hard time being around children because of the sorrow it makes me feel.  Everyday I see children that are Elias’ age, and I wonder what he would have been like,' she continued.

Ms Johnson has since moved to an unidentified city out West and is currently studying to become a nurse.

'My son was the most delightful calm little boy I have ever known.  Christopher Johnson took him from me.  I have spent years trying to heal from this unimaginable pain,' she said.

One law professor said Johnson's brief stay on death row is unusual and could possibly be among the shortest on record nationwide.

Donald Q. Cochran, a former prosecutor and a professor at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, said the only other case he could recall following such an abrupt time line was that of confessed Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

The two cases- Johnson and McVeigh- are tied, as both took six years between the time of the crime and the execution.

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the average time an inmate spends on death row awaiting execution is 14 years, with many waiting longer than 20 years.

Johnson was the sixth inmate executed in Alabama this year and the 38th put to death nationwide in 2011.

In a statement issued by Project Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty, executive director Esther Brown said even though the organization respects Johnson's right to have the death penalty imposed, they questioned his motives.

'We are a prisoner organization and therefore respect a prisoner's wishes. Nevertheless, we question Mr. Johnson's mental stability, which would allow him to make this kind of decision,' Brown said.
