Sales of skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products

Many men may be making sacrifices amid the continuing economic gloom but looking good isn’t one of them.

Sales of facial skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products.

A study by market researchers Mintel found that total sales of men’s grooming products was now £58million, up 3.6 per cent on the year.

Moisturiser was used by 42 per cent of men, while facial cleanser was used by almost a quarter (22 per cent).

As many as 23 per cent of all men use lip balm, while 16 per cent use facial wipes.

Eye cream and gels are used by seven per cent of men, while almost the same number use face masks and peels (six per cent).

A further eight per cent use anti ageing products.

Charlotte Libby, a Mintel analyst, said: ‘Prestige products have benefited from the “Lipstick Effect”, which has seen sales of luxury beauty products remain strong despite the economic downturn, as consumers treat themselves to small items.

'Additionally, increased and improved distribution channels will have no doubt buoyed the prestige sector.'

Top of the range products have risen by almost 10 per cent with people treating themselves despite being strapped for cash.

Meanwhile, overall, women are more sceptical about facial skincare claims than men.

More than half (52 per cent) of women don’t always believe the claims made by facial skincare products compared to 32 per cent of men.

Ms Libby said: 'While many of the nation’s men are adopting a regular skincare regime, it remains that a lower proportion of men use facial skincare products than women.

'Additionally, 19 per cent of men agree they only use facial skincare products when their skin visibly needs it.

'Men’s reactive approach to their skincare regime is the biggest challenge facing the industry.

'Encouraging men to adopt a more preventative approach to their skin’s needs could help drive sales in the category.'

Soap is the biggest loser from the sales, with the proportion of female users falling from 58 per cent in 2012 to around a third (36 per cent) in 2013.
