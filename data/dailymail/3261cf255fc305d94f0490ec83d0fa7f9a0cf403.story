A California man who gambled away $500,000 and is suing the Las Vegas casino in which he lost it has explained why the gambling palace is to blame for his loss.

Retiree Mark Johnston says the Downtown Grand Casino served him so many drinks that he has no memory of playing table games all day.

'I believed that they were just trying to take advantage of a player,' Johnston told CBS News.

Taking a gamble: Mark Johnson is citing Nevada gambling legislation in his suit for $500,000

'If you're intoxicated, you're not allowed to gamble. They're supposed to stop you.'

A lawyer for Mark Johnston says his client was so drunk when he lost the money that he couldn't see his playing cards.

Johnston is suing the casino, citing Nevada gambling laws, which forbid 'permitting persons who are visibly intoxicated to participate in gaming activity' and 'complimentary service of intoxicating beverages in the casino area to persons who are visibly intoxicated.'

He's not willing to take responsibility for being 'blackout drunk' either.

'I believe them just keep bringing me drinks, I blame that on them, and then continuously letting me gamble and letting me drink, I blame that on them,' he told CBS News.

Johnston estimates that he had two to four drinks at the Burbank airport, one drink on theÂ  flight to Las Vegas, two drinks in his limousine when he arrived, and 'several more' drinks at dinner.

After dinner, a 17-hour gambling binge ensued, which, says Johnston, he doesn't remember.

But memory or no, Johnston appears to have had quite the time in Sin City.

So much so that he took out a loan with the hotel for $500,000. And promptly lost it all.

And therein lies their claim, said Johnston's attorney Sean Lyttle.

'You certainly aren't to issue half a million dollars in markers to someone who's intoxicated,' he said.

'I feel like they picked my pockets,'
 Johnston told MyNews3. 'I feel like they took a drunk guy...like a 
drunk guy walking down the street, and you reach in his pockets and grab
 all his money.'

Just opened: The Downtown Grand had only been open for a couple of months when Johnston visited there from California in February. The casino is counter-suing Johnston for shirking his gambling debt

The experienced gambler says he's 'won this amount of money, and I've lost this kind of money,' before.

Johnston says the surveillance footage is being reviewed. The state Gaming Control Board is investigating.

The
 Downton Grand does not comment on pending litigation but Lyttle says 
the Grand, which opened late last year, is countersuing Johnston for 
trying to shirk his gambling debts.

Johnston says this all boils down to responsibility and, not surprisingly, he blamed the casino.

'They
 should have cut me off,' he said. 'The bottom line is the casinos are 
supposed to not gamble to you and not over-serve you in alcohol. That's 
gaming regulation.'

The casino has offered to settle for less money, but Johnston says he is proceeding with the lawsuit.
