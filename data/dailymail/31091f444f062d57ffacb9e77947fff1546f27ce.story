Drinking on park benches and rifling through bins, these Romanian immigrants are making their home in one of Britain’s most exclusive neighbourhoods.

The photographs were taken outside exclusive shops and restaurants on Park Lane in Central London, where the average property is worth more than £3million.

It was recently revealed how the number of Romanians sleeping rough in some parts of the capital has trebled since European Union restrictions on movement were lifted in January.

Upsetting the locals: Workers and residents nearby have complained that the Eastern European gangs have been washing in fountains and dumping rubbish

And earlier this year the Government 
pledged that arrested foreign nationals – including EU citizens - will 
face deportation even if they are not convicted of any crime.

The
 crackdown will use a European law that states those wanting to remain 
here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient - 
which could be used to tackle the Park Lane begging issue.

Local
 employees and residents of the area in W1 have complained that the 
Eastern European gangs have been allegedly washing in fountains, dumping
 rubbish and urinating in public.

Aaron
 Devaney, a sightseeing tour sales agent in Marble Arch, said last 
month: ‘They rob, they steal, they make a mockery of the country and 
then the police come and give them free flights home.

‘I know what they’re up to because I see them every day. They sleep around the edges of the grass and shower in the fountains.’

On the rise: A Westminster Council report shows that the number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London has risen from 20 in January to 59 last month

'The situation you see in these pictures is exactly what we feared would happen'

Councillor Nickie Aiken, Westminster City Council

Councillor
 Nickie Aiken, Westminster City Council cabinet member for public 
protection told MailOnline today: ‘The situation you see in these 
pictures is exactly what we feared would happen.

‘It’s
 why we led the campaign for new powers to deal with anyone who comes to
 London offering nothing but disruption - or worse.

‘The
 fact is that while Westminster City Council proactively seeks to help 
any rough-sleepers who have a genuine reason to be here, we have a 
problem that can only be solved on a national and international level.

‘That’s
 why we’re seeking assurances from Home Office Immigration Enforcement 
officials that they are doing everything possible to protect residents 
and businesses that do make a positive contribution to London life.’

The Mail On Sunday reported last month how the council has been working with the UK Border Agency to use new powers to crack down on homeless groups.

Under new legislation they can deport EU nationals sleeping rough and bar them from re-entry for 12 months if they cannot prove ‘they have a proper reason to be here, such as a job’.

In London, border guards have recently removed 44 Polish nationals, 64 Romanians and two Bulgarians, all either suspected offenders or criminals.

But Borcoi Freguta, a 45-year-old mother-of-seven who was living on the site last December, told the Mail at the time: 'People have the wrong impression about us. We’re not all criminals.'
