Everyone's heard of the crocodile hunter, well meet the crocodile huntress - a school girl from Australia's Top End.

This Northern Territory 17-year-old has been posted on possibly the most dangerous internship any school student has ever faced, catching crocodiles with some of Australia's most experienced reptile handlers in Darwin.

It's a job not for the faint-hearted and probably one most adults wouldn't do if they were paid. But Rebekah Gesch, channeling the late Steve Irwin, is getting up close and personal with the river monsters while working on a school-based internship.

Gotcha: A 3.4 metre croc was caged during an internship expedition Rebekah Gesch was on in Darwin

And although she might seem young, those with an enthusiasm for taming wild animals seem to start at an early age. By the time Steve Irwin was nine years old, he was helping his dad catch small crocodiles in muddy creek beds and wrestling them back to his dinghy.

It was a skill he carried on into in his adult years spawning the television series The Crocodile Hunter. And it appears his legend is living on through Rebekah who might have inherited the similar thrill seeking genes made famous by Irwin.

In one of the teenager's pictures the crocodile management team, from the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Commission, tempt a large crocodile with a long piece of rope with some bait attached to a pulley.

The reptile takes hold of the bait and wrestles its way towards the boat before being captured and caged.

Once boxed inside the security of the steel structure, it's counted alongside hundreds more caught by the handlers to get an idea of the number swimming in Australia's far northern rivers.

It is one of two crocs the handlers captured that day, the other being a two-metre crocodile pulled from a nearby creek. It brought the number of crocodiles caught in the Top End this this year to 151.

From Darwin's Good Shepherd Lutheran College, Rebekah has been volunteering on a school-based internship and venturing out on tours like this for the past two months.

She told the NT News being on 'croc patrol' was part of the daily tasks of the internship which also saw her working inside Charles Darwin National Park.

The crocodile management team are capturing and surveying the reptiles to get a better idea of its habitat, how many and to warn humans of the locations where they should never go.
