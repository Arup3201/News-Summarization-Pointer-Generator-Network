Celtic are refusing to sell Fraser Forster to Southampton until the Scottish club’s European fate is determined.

Southampton are poised with an improved offer for Forster after a £3.5m bid was rejected last week.

Celtic play Legia Warsaw in the Champions League qualifier on Wednesday with the return leg on August 6.

Glove affair: Celtic and England keeper is a target for Southampton

The Saints are looking to continue their policy of buying British after seeing several first team players, including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert, leave St Mary's in the summer.

However, they will have to increase their offer for the England international after Celtic described their opening bid as 'derisory' - the Scottish champions are believed to be holding out for a figure closer to £8 million.

Celtic manager Ronny Deila said: 'We want to keep Fraser because we want to qualify for the Champions League and build our team.

'We want to do what we can to keep him here.'
