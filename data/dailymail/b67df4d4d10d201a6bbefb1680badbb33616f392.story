There are 29 convicted sex offenders currently serving in the armed forces, it has been reported.

All are on the sex offenders’ register, with at least ten convicted in a civilian court. Six, meanwhile, were prosecuted at court martial and four were issued with a police caution.

One is reported to be a category one, level two offender, who is described as a risk to the public and whose behaviour is monitored.

According to the Daily Star Sunday, the other 28 are category one, level one offenders – the least serious classification.

Soldiers convicted of sexual offences are normally sacked by the Ministry of Defence apart from in ‘exceptional cases’.

The offences the 29 have been convicted for are said to include indecent assault and downloading internet child porn.

The information was obtained through a parliamentary question.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence told the paper: ‘All those who are found to fall short of the armed forces’ high standards or who are found to have committed an offence are dealt with robustly through the military discipline process and this can include discharge if required.

‘Personnel found guilty of a sexual offence are normally discharged but each is dealt with on a case-by-case basis and in exceptional circumstances can be approved.’

In 2011, a former SAS soldier carried out a string of 'repulsive' sexual assaults against children and even got one of them pregnant, forcing her to have a termination.

Ian Tuckely, from Walsall in the West Midlands, was branded 'dangerous' as he was jailed by Judge Patrick Thomas QC, who told the paedophile he had 'no idea' when he would be considered safe in the company of children.

The 32-year-old, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was told he must serve at least 12 and a half years before he is considered for release as he was given an indeterminate sentence.

Tuckley was found guilty of 15 sexual offences against two different girls last month.

He abused one girl from the age of six to when she was 18 and another girl when she was eight years old.
