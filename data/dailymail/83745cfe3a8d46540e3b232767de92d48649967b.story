‘The club was closing,’ San Antonio Police Chief William McManus told NBC affiliate WOAI. ‘They were leaving.

‘He approached them when they were near the car, killed the male and then chased the female and shot her multiple times.’

The shooting on Sunday, which police said was by a ‘wannabe boyfriend’, happened as the couple left the gym and walked in the car park.

Mr Escamilla was fatally shot in his upper torso as his girlfriend Miss McCombs ran across the car park, reported the Houston Chronicle.

He got into a short struggle with two officers after he refused to put up his hands when requested, but they managed to take him into custody, authorities said.

Police got control of the situation when an officer kicked Masaki to the ground.

He was only charged with aggravated assault on a police officer - while authorities probe whether he was indeed the gunman.
