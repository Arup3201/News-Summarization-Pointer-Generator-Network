A leading FBI analyst who gave a lecture last year criticising mainstream Muslims has been caught on camera giving a second presentation urging agents to 'forget Al Qaeda' and 'go after the Death Star' of Islam.

The Bureau's William Gawthrop was recorded making the 'dangerous' remarks to an audience of over 60 law enforcement officials during a counter-terrorism seminar in New York three months ago.

Gawthrop's presentation in June told the audience that the fight against Al Qaeda is a 'waste' compared to the threat posed by the ideology of Islam itself.

The controversial training seminar then went on to compare the 'internal forces which seek to exert Islamic rule' to the Death Star in the Star Wars films.

Gawthrop's 25-minute speech has since been branded 'mind-numbingly stupid and dangerous' and has drawn strong criticism from top Senators and representatives from Arab and Muslim-American groups.

During the lecture on June 8, Gawthrop tells the audience: 'We waste a lot of analytic effort talking about the type of weapon, the timing, the tactics. All of that is irrelevant... if you have an Islamic motivation for actions.'

According to Gawthrop, even taking down hostile states like Iran is futile, since 'there are still internal forces that will seek to exert Islamic rule again.'

He added: 'Look at the motive first... if you have an Islamic motivation for actions, group those together.

'So what is this doctrine? It is an expansive doctrine with a single objective: world imperial, controlling the world.

'That sounds grandiose... but it is a stated objective. The means to do that is jihad. Jihad is rooted in doctrine. There are identifiable rules of engagement and we will discuss that.'

It has since emerged that Gawthrop said before the speech he was speaking as a private citizen, rather than an FBI analyst

Gawthrop goes on: 'If you remember Star Wars, that ventilation shaft that goes down to into the depths of the Death Star, they shot a torpedo down there. Thatâ€™s a critical vulnerability.'

During the presentation Gawthrop then waved a laser pointer at his projected PowerPoint slide, highlighting the words 'Holy Texts' and 'Clerics.'

He then adds: 'We should be looking at, should be aiming at, these.'

Aki Peritz, a former intelligence analyst at the National Counterterrorism Center, now with the Third Way think-tank in Washington, told Wired.com: 'This is mind-numbingly stupid and dangerous.

'If we were to follow his idea to a logical extension, that means we have individuals in every single government agency, at top levels, from CIA to the Defense Department to members of Congress, that are part of this cabal to destroy Western civilization.

'If you truly believe that, then this is McCarthyism on steroids.'

According to Wired.com, Gawthrop 
delivered his speech at the New York chapter of Infragrad, a 
public-private partnership between the FBI and the private sector.

Infragrad has chapters across the 
U.S. 'dedicated to sharing information and intelligence to prevent 
hostile acts against the United States'.

Bosses at Infragrad have since defended the comments made by Mr Gawthrop, insisting that he made a 'good presentation'.

Joseph Concannon, president and CEO 
of New York Metro Infragard, told the Danger Room website: 'We actually 
thought Bill had a very good presentation.

Mr Gawthrop's comments about Islam were branded 'stupid and dangerous'

'We gained a better understanding of the constraints put on [Muslims] in cooperating with law enforcement by some of the rules and policies they have in place.'

In the June lecture, Gawthrop is said to have spoken as a private citizen, not as an FBI analyst.

The FBI has publicly declared that its counterterrorism training seminars linking 'mainstream' Muslims to terrorists was a 'one time only' affair that began and ended in April 2011.

Probe: An FBI spokesperson said the bureau would conduct a comprehensive review into the footage, as FBI training should be 'consistent with its core values'

The latest disclosure by Wired.com prompted the FBI to say it is conducting a comprehensive review of all FBI training and reference materials that may, in any way, relate to religion or culture.

An FBI spokesperson said: 'We are consulting with outside experts on the development and use of training materials, to best ensure the highest level of quality for new agent training, continuing education for all employees, and any FBI-affiliated training.

'All training will be consistent with FBI core values, the highest professional standards and adherence to the Constitution.'
