British shirtmaker Thomas Pink has filed an infringement case against Victoria's Secret over the name of its secondary line, Pink.

The London-based luxury shirt brand has accused the British arm of the U.S. underwear giant of misleading its customers by using the name Pink to market and sell its line, which is aimed at teenagers.

Thomas Pink, which has been using the iconic word Pink as their trademark since 1984, said that Victoria's Secret are confusing their younger customers by using the same name.

Legal battle: British shirtmaker Thomas Pink are taking on lingerie giant Victoria's Secret because they say using the same name for their younger line is 'confusing' to customers

Too similar? Thomas Pink, which was set up in 1984, said that Victoria's Secret Pink are confusing their younger customers by using the same name

Thomas Pink filed the infringement case 
with the Patents County Court and a spokesman told Vogue: 'Thomas Pink is determined to protect the considerable investment that has been made into building the world's luxury leading shirt brand.'

But industry heavyweight Victoria's Secret is now fighting back.

The lingerie brand, who can count Cara Delevingne, Miranda Kerr and Alessandra Ambrosio as past and present models, filed a declaratory judgment suit in the U.S. last week.

Victoria's Secret want to seek to establish 'the rights of the parties, allowing them to continue the peaceful coexistence that has been in place for many years,' according to Vogue.

Classic: Thomas Pink was established in London in 1984 by three Irish brothers James, Peter and John Mullen and prides itself on its quintessentially British shirts, pictured both left and right

Challenging: It seems to be a big challenge for Thomas Pink to take on Victoria's Secret- the largest American retailer of lingerie with 2012 sales of $6.12bn (£3.99bn) billion

The teen line - which was established in 2002 and aims its underwear, loungewear, beauty line and accessories, at 15 to 22-year-olds - has seen unfounded success in recent years, seeing sales reach $1 billion (£652m) in 2012.

Now the brand have cashed in by opening standalone stores around the world with two in London (one in Westfield Stratford and a flagship store on Bond Street).

The average price of a Thomas Pink ladies shirt is £89, while a Victoria's Secret Pink shirt is around £40.

It seems to be a big challenge for Thomas Pink - who recoded annual profits of £33.87 million in the UK last year - to take on Victoria's Secret - the largest American retailer of lingerie with 2012 sales of $6.12 (£3.99) billion.

No comment has been made by Victoria's Secret and their Pink site is currently temporarily unavailable.

It is now part of the LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey) group and has flagship stores in London’s Jermyn Street, Madison Avenue, New York and Rue Francois Premier, Paris and a total of 90 stores worldwide.

The company was named after Mr Pink, an 18th century London tailor.

He was responsible for designing the hunting coat worn by Masters of Foxhounds and other huntsmen.
