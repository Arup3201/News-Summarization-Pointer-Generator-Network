The founder of bookshop chain Waterstones has said that traditional printed books will see off the challenge of the e-reader 'revolution'.

Tim Waterstone, who started the retail chain in 1982, said that there were indications that the e-book's market share was in decline, and that printed books were 'immovable'.

Speaking at an Oxford Literary Festival event on Saturday, entitled The Future Of Publishing, Mr Waterstone said he did not believe that physical books were under threat from their technological counterparts, such as Amazon's Kindle, the Apple iPad and the Kobo eReader.

No threat: Tim Waterstone, the founder of the Waterstones bookshop chain, has said that traditional printed books will see off the challenge of the e-reader 'revolution'

'I think you read and hear more garbage about the strength of the 
e-book revolution than anything else I’ve known,' Mr Waterstone said, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'The e-books have developed a share of the 
market, of course they have, but every indication – certainly from 
America – shows the share is already in decline. The indications are 
that it will do exactly the same in the UK.'

Mr Waterstone left the bookshop which bears his name in 2001 after merging the business with HMV in 1998.

In 2012 Waterstones, which is now owned by Russian businessman Alexander Mamut and run by James Daunt, started selling Amazon's Kindle in its 300 British stores, and Kindle 
users can read some books for free while connected to the Waterstones 
wifi network.

Last year British readers spent £300million on 80million e-books, but £2.2billion on 323million traditionally printed books.

Figures released by the Association of American publishers showed that hardcover book sales had gone up by 11.5 per cent in the 12 months leading up to last November, while the sales of adult e-books had climbed by just 4.8 per cent, indicating that while sales were growing they had levelled off.

A separate study by the Pew Research Centre from January this year revealed that while 28 per cent of American readers surveyed said they had read an e-book in 2013, 69 per cent said they had read a printed book.

Success: Experts at Neilsen said a drop off in e-book sales could be explained by a lack of a publishing success story such as E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey

Fall: There was also a comparative fall in sales of children's titles such as The Hunger Games, which was made into a hit film series starring Jennifer Lawrence

Just four per cent of those questioned said they were e-book only.

A UK study by Neilsen BookData showed e-book sales fell by 26 per cent in four weeks to June 9,  2013, compared with the corresponding period in 2012.

Experts at Neilsen said the drop off could be explained by a lack of a publishing success story such as E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey in 2012, and a comparative fall in sales of children’s titles, such as the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, and non-fiction.

Mr Waterstone told the audience in Oxford that print on paper had lasted for centuries and he was sure the traditional book would last long into the future.

He said: 'The product is so strong, the interest 
in reading is so deeply rooted in the culture and human soul of this 
country that it is immovable.'
