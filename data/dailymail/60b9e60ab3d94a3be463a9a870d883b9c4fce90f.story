When Krystal Whitesell found out her father was not going to live to see her wedding day, she decided to move it so he could walk her down the aisle.

She decided to surprise him by arranging to have the ceremony the hospital in Greensboro, North Carolina where her father Kenneth Whitesell, who is suffering from terminal lung cancer, now lives.

Ms Whitesell rallied hospital staff, who were more than happy help make it a memorable event, and less than a week later, she married with her father at her side.

Krystal Whitesell, from Greensboro, North Carolina, knew her father Kenneth would not live until her June wedding, so moved the nuptials to the solarium of Moses Cone Hospital

Even though there was no aisle for Kenneth to walk daughter Krystal down, he was wheeled alongside his daughter as they made their way into the solarium for the ceremony

Ms Whitesell had told her father on 
Monday that she would be moving her nuptials so that he could attend, 
but what Kenneth did not know, was that they would take place at Moses 
Cone Hospital the following Friday.

With
 the help of three nurses who wheeled him on his bed with bags of fluids
 and electronic monitors attached to him throughout the ceremony, Mr 
Whitesell followed his daughter up the makeshift aisle.

Despite
 having less than a week to plan the wedding, Ms Whitesell and hospital 
staff were able to provide food and drinks, help decorate the solarium 
and rope in the hospital chaplain to conduct the ceremony.

'I love my daddy. I wanted him to be there,' Ms Whitesell told local paper News & Record.

Joy and pride: Kenneth Whitesell said that his daughter's wedding day was the happiest day of his life

Surrounded by 20 friends and family, Ms Whitesell married her fiance Michael Neddham - her proud father at her side.

'It’s
 the best day of my life,' Mr Whitesell told News & Record from his 
bed in the hospital’s solarium. 'I’m so glad I was a part of it.'

Mr Whitesell's nurse, Beth Passmore added that the entire hospital wanted to help.

'We wanted to do anything we could for her and her family'.

'It was just another way to show we care for our community. We made it happen.'
