Admission: Tony Barrett called a TV station newsroom saying he killed his wife

A Washington man was apprehended after he called a TV newsroom and declared that he had just killed his wife, then asked the station to broadcast the news on their Facebook page.

Tony Barrett, 41, was arrested early Thursday after a high-speed chase that reached 100 mph from Tacoma to Gig Harbor, where police and state troopers stopped his car with spike strips, authorities said.

'I just killed my wife... I want you to put it on your Facebook,' Barrett told  KOMO in a phone call late Wednesday night. 'It was supposed to be `til death do us part, but she wouldn't...'

His wife and mother of their three sons, 42-year-old Sara Barrett, was found dead from 'homicidal violence' around 6 a.m. THursday at a Tacoma motel, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said.

The discovery came just hours after Barrett, who has a history of violence against his wife, was arrested around 2:30 a.m.

'He got out swinging a crowbar' at officers who used a police dog to take him down, Troyer said.

He was treated at a hospital for dog bites on the way to jail and held for investigation of murder.

Barrett had called the station because he didn't have a Facebook page and wanted the station to post the message, Troyer said. The caller did not say where the woman could be found.

The assignment desk asked if there was someone they could notify, and the caller said, 'No, I'm not going to be here much longer.'

He said he and his wife had been together 28 years. He disconnected the call when they mentioned police.

'Very odd,' Troyer said. 'That was a full-blown confession to place on Facebook.'

Concerned for the wife, the station worked with the sheriff's office. Investigators were able to identify the man, his wife and their cars.

Authorities said Barrett's car was spotted around 2:30 a.m. Thursday in Tacoma and he sped away over Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with police and troopers in pursuit until his tires were flattened and he was arrested. He wouldn't talk to officers about his wife.

The investigation led detectives to the body at the motel, where the couple had checked in Wednesday evening, Troyer said.

'We were hoping to find her' alive, Troyer said. 'But obviously it didn't work that way.'

The couple was estranged and investigators did not know what led to the killing, Troyer said.

Court records show Barrett had attacked his wife in 2007, holding a pillow over her face until she nearly suffocated, the station reported.

The couple's grown son broke down the bedroom door and stopped the attack. Barrett pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and served a day in jail and two years under supervision by the Department of Corrections.

He pleaded guilty to to third-degree assault and served one day in jail. He was also ordered not to have any hostile contact with Sara Barrett for five years. That order expired on Feb. 25.

Sara Barrett had filed for protection orders against her husband in 2009 and again in 2012, but she failed to show up for court so they were denied.

In the second petition, she said her husband had followed her to her car after work one day and forced her into his car at knifepoint so they could talk.

'He has said that he will never let me go,' she wrote in the petition. 'I am afraid for my life when it comes to him.'

Barrett works as a delivery driver for the Tacoma School Districtâ€™s purchasing department, delivering food, school and office supplies to various campuses. He began working there in July 2001 and is currently on a two-week vacation, district spokesman Dan Voelpel said.
