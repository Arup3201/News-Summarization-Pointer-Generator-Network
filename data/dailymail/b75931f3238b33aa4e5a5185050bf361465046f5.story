A Texas woman made a startling discovery when she bit down into a burrito she bought at a convenience store earlier this week for the bargain price of 86 cents - in addition to theÂ  beans and cheese, Cynthia Corrigan found a piece of latex glove inside her burrito.

On the bright side, she says, there wasn't a finger inside of the glove.

On Wednesday, Corrigan walked into a Stripes convenience store in Midland, Texas, and bought herself the economically friendly treat on her way to work.

Gross: A Texas woman found this piece of a latex glove inside of a burrito she bought at a convenience store for 86 cents

'I just wanted to stop by and get one, I hadn't had one in I don't know how long,' Corrigan told KWES. 'I couldn't wait.'

After a few bites, Corrigan found something amiss about her burrito.

'I was using taco sauce and when I was looking at my burrito to put it 
in, that's when I noticed the little blue speck in there,' Corrigan 
said. 'I didn't even know what to expect at that point, what was coming out of there, it was so gross.'

Upon further inspection, Corrigan realized that the blue speck she'd found actually was the finger of a latex glove.

'It was nauseating. I kind of yelled and my boss came and asked me what was wrong,' she said. 'Luckily no finger in it!'

Buyer beware: Always use caution when buying Mexican food from a store that also sells gasoline

Corrigan says she then called the store to alert management that she had nearly eaten a piece of a glove she found in her burrito. The manger told her that burritos come from an outside vendor and the only thing the convenience store does in terms of preparing the burritos is frying them after they receive the frozen burritos from the vendor.

The manager told Corrigan to fill out an incident report with the company's corporate office.

'I filled out my incident report and he refunded my money for the one burrito,' she says.

In a statement, the company says the burritos are a 'pre-packaged good supplied by a third party vendor,' but said the incident was unacceptable. Additionally, the company removed all of the similar products and notified the vendor from which it buys its burritos.

Corrigan says that while she's still a bit grossed out, she is satisfied with how the convenience store handled the situation

Corrigan says that while she's a bit grossed out, she's satisfied with how the company handled the situation.

'He genuinely apologized, shook my hand and thanked me for being a customer and that's all I could ask for,' she says.

As for whether she'll go back to Stripes, Corrigan says 'maybe for a soda but not food.'
