Tragic: Zoe Anderson died from carbon monoxide poisoning

A gas fitter whose faulty boiler installation led to the carbon monoxide death of a millionaire's daughter has been convicted of her manslaughter.

Andrew Hartley fitted the new boiler into Zoe Anderson’s Bath home less than two weeks before she was overcome by gas fumes.

The 37-year-old had already admitted a charge of breaching gas safety regulations by failing to secure the boiler flue pipe with screws.

But a jury at Bristol Crown Court today found Hartley guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence following his 'rushed' and 'botched' job on the appliance in December 2010.

During the trial the court heard that Miss Anderson, 24, the daughter of magazine tycoon Chris Anderson, was found dead by her boyfriend in the shower room of her father’s home in Sion Hill - one of Bath’s most exclusive streets.

At first it was thought the neuroscience graduate had slipped and banged her head, but later it was found she had collapsed from carbon monoxide poisoning.

The prosecution said Hartley - who was paid more than £2,000 - did a 'rushed' and 'botch' job, failing to secure the flue pipe correctly, if at all.

Miss Anderson died within just 30 minutes of being exposed to the carbon monoxide after fumes leaked from the flue pipe connected to the boiler in the garage of the Victorian townhouse.

Hartley, who was wearing a dark suit, showed no emotion as the jury forewoman returned the verdict, although his wife, sitting in the public gallery, burst into tears and had to be comforted by friends.

Prosecutor James Townsend told jurors: 'The only person who really knows how the installation went is Mr Hartley - he was the man who fitted the boiler.

'Initially no-one knew what had caused Zoe’s death - it appeared to be a mystery - but after an examination by a pathologist it was clear she had died from carbon monoxide poisoning.

'When the boiler was working, instead of the fumes going down the piping to the outside they were being blown out into the garage rather than the flue pipe.

'The extension pipe should be firmly fitted to the turret flue elbow and in addition the extension piping should be secured in the turret elbow with the use of screws.

'The only explanation for the boiler leaking the fumes within days of the fitting can be that it wasn’t attached at all in the first place or if it was, it wasn’t left fitted correctly.'

Carbon monoxide had been 'pouring' into the house since the boiler was fitted on December 16, Mr Townsend said.

Miss Anderson had been in America visiting her father while the boiler was fitted but returned to Bath on December 27 and complained the new boiler was not working and the house was freezing.

She was due to meet a friend at the cinema the next night at 8pm but failed to turn up.

The next day her boyfriend, Alastair Uhlig, travelled from London to meet her but when he turned up at the house he could not get inside.

After going to Miss Anderson’s mother’s house to find a spare set of keys, he returned to the townhouse where he found his girlfriend lifeless in the shower room.

Hartley was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and admitted he had neglected to fit screws to the extension pipe but maintained the boiler had been correctly fitted.

He suggested the flue pipe had become disconnected during the cold weather.

Mr Townsend added: 'The prosecution say the explanation, a desperate explanation, was put forward by the defendant to try to explain the botched job he had undertaken.

'The failure to fit the screws, a tiny but important job in its own right, was a serious measure of indication of the defendant’s attitude to the job.'

Hartley, who has been in the gas and plumbing industry for 20 years and had an unblemished career, was said by colleagues, acquaintances and friends to be reliable, professional and trustworthy.

He told jurors that he admitted a 
charge of contravening gas safety regulations, which reflected his 
failure to secure the flue pipe with screws.

However, he denied he was grossly negligent and said he felt 'awful' about not carrying out the installation properly.

'I didn’t complete it the way I should have done because I didn’t put the screws in,' Hartley said.

He said that when he left Mr Anderson’s home the Worcester boiler was working properly and he had fully tested it.

Father-of-three Chris Anderson, who was in court to hear the verdict, previously took to the witness box on the first day of Hartley’s trial.

He proudly told the jury of seven women and five men how his eldest daughter had been due to fly to her 'dream job', as an intern at Foursquare, in New York, four days after her death.

Judge Neil Ford QC, The Recorder of 
Bristol, released Hartley, of Bath New Road, Radstock, Somerset, on bail
for the preperation of reports until sentencing in April.
