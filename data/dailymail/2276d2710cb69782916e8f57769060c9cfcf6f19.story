Bargain hunter Holly Smith pulls in more than £10,000 each year in prizes - by spending hours a day entering online competitions.

Ms Smith, 28, suffers from a rare stomach condition and has recurring bone tumours which have left her hospitalised in the past.

But to help support her working husband and two children, she spends hours each day trawling the internet for competitions and cash saving coupons - entering as many as 800 competitions a day.

She said: 'All in all I reckon I bring in £10,000 each year from competitions. I even have a note book at the side of my bed in case I wake in the night thinking about a coupon I haven't tried.'

Holly Smith shows off some of the thousands of prizes she wins by entering up to 800 competitions a day

Ms Smith, who suffers from a health condition which has prevented her working,  subsidised her wedding using vouchers, coupons and competitions

So far, she has won a trip to Gran Canaria through a Kellogg's competition worth £2,500 and her £70,000 haul of goodies also includes fridge freezers, washing machines, TVs, games consoles and concert tickets.

Other prizes have included a three year supply of toothpaste, a six month supply of toilet paper and a five star trip to the Isle of Man worth £2000.

The money she saves helps subsidise husband Callum's income as a massage therapist and many of the prizes she wins she donates to charities including the Salvation Army.

Even her own wedding was subsidised by her love of coupons and competitions. She won supermarket vouchers which paid for the wedding desserts, she won £1,000 cash toward the reception and hired a luxury wedding car for £40 which normally cost £250 for two days.

Ms Smith, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, said: 'I have done really well out of the competitions. I started doing them when I was 21 and only recently took up couponing. I can enter around 100 to even 800 competitions a day.

'We are now on first name terms with the postman because he is delivering something pretty much every day. He doesn't even need to knock on the door now. It really helps me with the pain, to know that something maybe arriving the next day.' 

Ms Smith suffers from a rare condition that affects around 1,000 people in the UK and causes muscle spasms

Her haul of prizes has included toys and games, which she has started donating to charity

She takes hundreds of pounds off the family's  shopping bill and has won scores of gifts - including DVDs

She added: 'I am not one to sit and watch Jeremy Kyle. I enter the competitions to deal with the pain and to contribute to my family.' 

Ms Smith started entering competitions when she was just 21 years old after being diagnosed with a a rare condition called Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction that only affects around 1,000 people in the UK and causes spasms in the muscles that control the flow of bile into the digestive system.

Among the prizes Ms Smith has won are - 

A trip to Alton Towers with £300 spending money

Use of a Skoda Octavia for a week

A trip with British Airways to see ACDC in Germany

A luxury trip worth £2,500 to Jersey

A trip to Gran Canaria worth £2,500

Three TVs

Two Nintendo Wii’s

A PS3 and an Xbox 360

Three video cameras

An iPad

£2,500 cash prize from Doritos

£300 worth of DVDs

£1,500 in wedding decorations

She had invasive surgery to her left shin to remove a tumour that fractured her leg in six places and had a metal rod put through the bone which means she has difficulty walking.

She added: 'I bought a dog to have some company and I went on the internet to win something for him in a dog competition. That was the start of my addiction.

'I often wake up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain and entering these competitions really takes my mind off the pain. It happens when the medication wears off. Sometimes I might enter competitions from 1am to 10am.

'I just have to distract myself by doing something and with these competitions you often have to be creative, use your mind to think of funny slogans or come up with reasons why you should win. 

'I have been struggling so much with the pain and it really takes my mind off it. I can win anything from dog food to a £2,500 cash prize from Doritos.

'The weirdest thing I have won was a book about the history of roundabout and a DVD about towing a caravan.

'I once won a £5,000 ski trip but I couldn't get insurance due to my leg so I couldn't go.' 

Receipts show how much the family save each week by Ms Smith's 'addiction' to coupons and deals

Ms Smith's husband Callum, who works as a massage therapist, celebrates a haul of prizes. His wife spends hours a day looking for deals online

She added: 'Our wedding day was heavily subsidized because of competitions and my couponing. I won all a whole load of craft gear to do the invites and sold £300 worth of DVDs I had won.

'I reckon all in all, out of a proper church wedding with a lovely reception, 80 guests and a chocolate fountain I won £1500 in decorations, craft gear and other things.

'I will have saved thousands with the coupons. The wine on the tables was free with coupons. That is £1,500 I could put toward a £4,500 wedding.' 

Ms Smith also goes to extreme lengths to cut down on her grocery shopping bill spending four hours each week flitting between supermarkets - much to the delight of her four-year-old daughter.

She said: 'I have a massive binder which puts the coupons in date order. It takes us up to 4 hours to do a grocery shop because instead of just buying everything in Tesco like I used to, we go to loads of different supermarkets. We go from Asda to Sainsbury's to Aldi.'

Ms Smith - pictured with husband Callum and daughters Mollie-Rose and Bella-Marie, now two - says the bargain hunting is her way of contributing to the family budget

The family's home in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk is full of stacks of supplies the busy mother has won online

She added: 'My daughter gets really bored because we are doing it for so long that we invented a game called "spot the win". She has got really good at it. 

'She has to look around the supermarket for things that say "win" on it. These are just more opportunities for us to get stuff and save money.

'I just have to distract myself by doing something and with these competitions you often have to be creative, use your mind to think of funny slogans or come up with reasons why you should win. 

'We do all kinds of thing to win. Once, to win a trip to Alton Towers we all dressed up in Halloween gear.'

'The best thing about all this is I can always give stuff to my friends and family. I won my husband Callum a trip with British Airways to see ACDC in Germany.

'It was all paid for and he loved it. I won a luxury trip worth £2500 to Jersey and I gave it my mum for 60th birthday - she had the best time ever.'

Ms Smith now has her own blog called UK Couponing, which she is trying to turn into a business, and a popular Facebook page which now has more than 12,000 followers.
