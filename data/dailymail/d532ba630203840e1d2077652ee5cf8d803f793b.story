Former Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes has picked his #one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career, onThe Fantasy Football Club.

It is no surprise that Gomes' team is dominated by Brazilians, as the eccentric keeper played alongside several World Cup winners.

But Spurs stars get a look in to, with now QPR midfielder Sandro the surprise inclusion alongside Gareth Bale, Luka Modric and Ledley King 

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. 

GOALKEEPER:Dida

'Even before I met him for the first time he was a great goalkeeper, he was my inspiration' 

Gomes picked Brazilian legends Kaka and Roberto Carlos as the best full backs he ever played with

Gomes said facing a Roberto Carlos free kick, even in training, was a terrifying experience

RIGHT-BACK: Cafu

'He was fantastic, always up and down. That gave the team so much energy.' 

CENTRE-BACK: Ledley King

'He's just amazing. He couldn't train during the week, he'd come once a week for 25 minutes, 30 maximum. And he was ok for the game. I can't remember him making a foul. He tackled only the ball.' 

CENTRE-BACK: Alex

'A real leader, he was very quiet guy outside the pitch, in the dressing room, but when he came on the pitch he was so important for any team.'

Despite his injury problems, Ledley King was still able to perform at the highest level for Spurs with Gomes 

LEFT-BACK: Roberto Calos

'His finishing was amazing. Those free kicks were so powerful. It was difficult to train with him, and train against him. When he came to hit the ball against you, it was scary. Fortunately I played on his side.'

DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD :Sandro

'He was a real beast in front of the defence. I believe for the defenders, and also for the goalkeeper, he made it an easy job for us.'

CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Phillip Cocu

'He was, at my time at PSV, so important for me. You can give him the ball and he can pass, he can tackle, he can score goals. He was a great player.'

CENTRAL MIDFIELD: Luka Modric

'He was a masterclass. You know he can pass long balls and short balls, you can give him the ball forever. If you don't know who to pass to, pass to Luka Modric, he will give you the answer.'

LEFT WING: Gareth Bale

'No-one can beat him in that position. He was so important for us. He is the kind of player who can decide games, as he did at Inter Milan. We were one player down, and he almost gave us a point in that game.'

RIGHT WING : Ronaldinho 

'I could pick Kaka, or Robinho, but I pick Ronaldinho. His free kicks were just amazing. Over the wall, or under the wall - he used to do it in training sessions. They could keep the ball in the air for such a long time, doing tricks. It was just amazing to see.'

STRIKER: Ronaldo

'Outside the pitch he was just a simple guy. So simple. Ronaldo is just a goal machine. He can finish left or right, doesn't matter. In a short space he was so fast.' 

Gareth Bale scored a hat-trick to help Spurs come back from 4-0 down against Inter to almost get a point
