Children should be weighed every year in primary school to stop them getting fat, according to the head of the Commons health committee.

Tory MP Sarah Wollaston warned that most parents do not know that they child is ‘slipping’ into obesity.

One in five children are overweight when they start primary school, but by the time they leave aged 11 the figure has risen to one in three.

Children are weighed at in reception and Year 6 of primary school, but there are warnings this is not enough to stem the obesity timebomb

Dr Wollaston, a former GP, was elected to chair the health select committee last week.

She argues that current rules on measuring children only in their first and last year of primary school risked failing to catch health problems during the intervening seven years.

Official figures show that 22.2 per cent of children aged four and five in reception classes were classed as overweight in 2012-13. But the figure rises to 33.3 per cent among Year 6 children.

Dr Wollaston is calling for annual health checks to prevent children’s weight ballooning during their schooldays.

‘We should be measuring every year. If children start to slip into difficulties you can let parents know and offer help,’ she told The Sun.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP who now chairs the Commons health select committee, warned many parents do not know their children are slipping into obesity

Obesity costs the NHS £5billion every year. In 2012-13, more than 3,100 children were admitted to hospital with illnesses linked to obesity, up from 1,117 a decade earlier.

Dr Wollaston told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: 'A survey in Newcastle showed that parents tend to underestimate their children’s weight. It’s about catching them before they slip into obesity.

'Parents want information and the best thing they can do is cut sugar out of their children’s diets. The assumption that parents know that their children are slipping into problems is just not right.

'The results of the child management programme are never shared with the school. They can be shared with the parents but sometimes they would have to ask for the results to be sent direct to them.’

Health campaigners backed the idea of regularly weighing children in schools.

But Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'You don't need some nannying doctor to tell you children are overweight.'

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Children are weighed and measured at key points in their development- the start and end of primary school. Local authorities can measure children more often if they choose to.

'We know some people eat too many calories including sugar. Childhood obesity is at its lowest since 1998 but more should be done. 

'We want to help people make healthier choices and get the nation into healthy habits for life. 

'We have invested £155m into school sport and our Change4Life Sports Clubs are helping over 225,000 children to take part.'

In primary schools alone 75,000 children now enjoy 60 active minutes on most days of the week — an increase of nearly 60 per cent. 

We have also committed £1.2 million to promote walking in five of our major cities.' Local authorities can measure children more often if they choose.’

New food standards will encourage schools to make milk available while limiting access to unhealthy snacks and fruit juice.

They will specify that semi-skimmed milk ‘must be available for drinking at least once a day’ in all primary and secondary institutions. However, it will not be free for all. 

Under the guidelines, fruit juice will be restricted to one 150ml glass per day from January amid growing evidence of the damaging effect of its rich natural sugars on children’s developing teeth.

Many nutritionists now recommend that children are only allowed one small glass of fruit juice per week as a treat.
