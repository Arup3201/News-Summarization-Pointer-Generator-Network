The 17-year-old girl charged with the January shooting spree that killed one police officer and wounded another made her first appearance in court on Monday, with her lawyers saying she is 'scared to death' staring down her maximum sentence of life in prison.

Looking solemn and dressed in a yellow jail jumpsuit, Meagan Dakota Grunwald, of Draper, appeared in front of a judge in Provo, Utah, to face accusations she was high on meth when she and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was trying to help them with car trouble last month.

Grunwald, who is being held at the Salt Lake County jail, is charged as an adult with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony, and 13 other charges related to the January 30 events.

She is accused of driving her pickup truck while her boyfriend allegedly shot and killed one police officer and wounded another, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Life in prison without parole is the maximum penalty the teen could face if convicted of aggravated murder.

Because she is a minor, she is not eligible for the death penalty.

Meagan Grunwald, 17, who has been charged as an adult in the shootings of two Utah deputies, makes her first appearance in Judge Darold McDade's court in Provo, Utah, on Monday

Megan Grunwald is being tried as an adult - and standing trial for the murder her boyfriend took out - because there was enough culpability

Grunwald is also charged with two counts of felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of attempted aggravated murder, and aggravated robbery — all first-degree felonies — along with charges of felony obstructing justice, failure to respond to an officer, possession or use of a controlled substance and lesser charges of felony discharge of a firearm, and misdemeanor criminal mischief and violation of operator duties after an accident.

While 27-year-old Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui is accused of pulling the trigger, prosecutors claim the teen girl is just as responsible for killing Utah County Sheriff’s Sgt. Cory Wride and wounding deputy Greg Sherwood.

'We think the culpability is such that she should be charged as an adult,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Sam Pead said outside of court.

Prosecutors have said that the teen was an 'active participant' in the alleged crimes.

Zabriskie said the teen is 'scared to death'.

'Being locked up in an adult environment with these serious charges is very traumatizing for her,' he said.

Documents filed in court shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in death on I-15 roadway last month.

Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help.

Grunwald
 was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She 
gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a 
false name.

Wride went 
back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother
 and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's 
actual identity.

It was while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer and his girlfriend sped off.

Wride died and his body wasn't found until 45 minutes later when another deputy was sent out to check up on him.

Fellow deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over.

But Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend started shooting.

Garcia-Juregui hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood eventually recovered from the injury and returned home Tuesday after spending 19 days in the hospital.

Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday

After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on the road near Nephi, Utah. 

Instead of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flagged down a minivan and her boyfriend carjacked the vehicle from a woman who was on her way home from a parent-teacher conference.

This is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime spree.

After abandoning the truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be coerced by him'.

The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. 

After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose.

Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head.

Justice: Grunwald has her first hearing scheduled for next Monday. She is being held on $1million

While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him'

The officers kept the couple separated as they arrested Grunwald and prepared her boyfriend to be taken to the hospital, which displeased a dying Garcia-Juaregui.

'You not going to let me kiss my girl with my last dying breath,' he asked. He died the following day at the hospital

Friends who knew the couple told investigators that Grunwald was carrying Garcia-Juaregui's child and the two planned to marry in August when she turned 18.

On her Facebook page, Grunwald posted a
 cover photo which reads:' I'm just a girl who is in love with the most 
annoying, cutest, funniest, nicest, and completely perfect guy in the 
world'.

After their 
marriage, the couple planned to move to Mexico. They had been living at 
Grunwald's mother's home in Draper 'for several months'.

Grunwald
 had allegedly been buying meth for her boyfriend and tested positive 
for the drug after her arrest. Prosecutors have not yet said whether 
Garcia-Juaregui had meth in his system during the car chase but drug paraphernalia was found in the truck.

She
 faces 12 felony charges which include the first-degree murder of Wride,
 attempted aggravated murder for critically injuring Sherwood and 
aggravated robbery for the car jacking.
