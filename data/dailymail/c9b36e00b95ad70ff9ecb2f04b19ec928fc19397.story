Fears: There are mixed reports circulating that Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction may be caught up in Cyclone Marcia in Queensland Australia

A fan going by the Twitter name of @DailyBailey3 has claimed his mother met Louis on the island on Thursday night.

‘Here is me receiving the photos last night at 11:05,’ he wrote on his Twitter timeline, attaching a screenshot of a text message conversation between his mother and himself which showed her sending the snaps to him.

The two photos showed the blonde posing with Louis, who looked rather relaxed in a black singlet as he pulled some fun faces for the camera.

It seems Louis was dining at Mediterranean restaurant Manta Ray.

The fan went on to post another image, writing: ‘My mum met Louis Tomlinson last night at manta ray in Hamilton island (sic)’.

He later added: 'Heres a pic of the restaurant for those who don't believe you can tell its the same by the railing and roof.@idkflo,' also attaching a photo of the Manta Ray's exteriors. 

When contacted by Daily Mail Australia, a representative for the band from Sony Music Australia said 'At this stage we are unable to make a comment about the location of the guys'.  

Fans of One Direction are also worried Louis and Zayn may not be able to make it to Perth in time if they are indeed staying in areas affected by the cyclone, with the flight to Perth approximately eight hours.

A representative from Hamilton Island airport told Daily Mail Australia the airport has not been shut down at this stage, with flights to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Cairns still going ahead.  

Fan site OTRA Tour Updates wrote on Twitter on Friday morning: ‘wait if the show in Perth is tomorrow night and this thing is coming wouldn't travel not be permitted? Uh oh’. 

Hamilton Island is approximately 532 kilometres north of the town Yeppoon, which is expected to be affected by the cyclone on Friday.

Will they make it? One Direction is scheduled to perform in Perth on Friday night, and some fans are worried Louis and Zayn won't be able to travel to Western Australia in time if they are indeed in Hamilton Island

One Direction kicked off their Australian tour at the beginning of the month, performing in Sydney on February 7 and 8.

They then performed in Queensland's capital city of Brisbane on February 11, before travelling south to Melbourne. 

On Tuesday the pop stars took to the stage in Adelaide, with their next performance scheduled in Perth on Friday night. 

A representative from Patersons Stadium in Perth has confirmed to Daily Mail Australia the One Direction concert at this stage is still going ahead at its venue on Friday night.

A dire warning has been issued to hundreds of residents in the path of category 5 Cyclone Marcia tearing towards the Queensland's coastline, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk admitting the next few hours will be 'harrowing and terrifying'.

The severe cyclone, packing winds of 300km per hour, is expected to cause catastrophic damage to Yeppoon in far north Queensland on Friday morning, when the cyclone makes landfall about 8am local time, Ms Palaszczuk warned.

'Please do not leave your homes this morning. Go to the strongest part of your house, which is usually the bathroom area. Take clothes and mattresses. Make sure your children are safe. Your safety now is paramount,' she said.

'Over the next few hours, many Queenslanders are going to go through a harrowing and terrifying experience. We will be standing by your side. This is a severe cyclone, I want everyone to take all the precautions.'

Hamilton Island is approximately 532 kilometres north of the town Yeppoon, which is expected to be affected by the cyclone on Friday 

A stoney-faced Ms Palaszczuk said it was too late to escape the storm's destructive path and residents should seek shelter in the safest place they could find.

Emergency officials are warning people to take shelter ahead of torrential rain and flooding, destructive winds and massive seas as the worst of the storm hits - with Cyclone Marcia predicted to be the most destructive cyclone in the state since 2013. 

Brian Cox, from the State Disaster Co-ordination Centre in Brisbane, says the eye is currently approaching Yeppoon and is expected to cross the coast at about 8am.

He said the timing couldn't be worse, with the landfall time expected very close to the peak of the high tide at 10am, compounding the risk of flooding from the dangerous storm surge the cyclone will bring.

Rockhampton, south of Yeppoon, is also in the firing line with Marcia still expected to be a strong category three cyclone when it hits there, after tracking south over land.
