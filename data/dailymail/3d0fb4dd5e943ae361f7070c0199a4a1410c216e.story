Just like a fine wine, Tim Howard is getting better with age.

The 35-year-old proved as much on Tuesday evening when he put in arguably the greatest goalkeeping performance ever witnessed at a World Cup during the USA's narrow extra-time defeat to Belgium in Salvador.

He conceded twice in that added 30 minutes, failing to stop Kevin de Bruyne's low strike and Romelu Lukaku's sweeping finish, but he had already won the hearts of a nation with a string of fine saves.

In total he kept Marc Wilmots' side out on 15 separate occasions - a new World Cup record - and almost helped his country reach the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time in 12 years.

He has since received a congratulatory telephone call from president Barack Obama and seen a petition for his name to adorn an airport in Washington begin online.

While the Tim Howard Washington National Airport is still some way off from becoming a reality, the transformation of the former MetroStars keeper from Manchester United flop to the most talked about player in world football - at least for a night - is complete.

Howard began his career at Old Trafford in promising fashion after joining from Major League Soccer for around Â£3million in 2003, making a decisive penalty save to help the Red Devils win the Community Shield against Arsenal.

He continued his impressive form in the Premier League, cementing his place as the club's No 1 goalkeeper ahead of Frenchman Fabian Barthez and Roy Carroll as Sir Alex Ferguson's side chased the title.

But the honeymoon period didn't last for long. In the latter half of his first season in England, Howard fumbled a Benni McCarthy free-kick during a Champions League last 16 tie against Porto and allowed Costinha to fire home the rebound.

United were out, Jose Mourinho famously ran down the touchline to celebrate and Howard's confidence was shot to bits. He lost his place in the side to Carroll but did recapture it in time to help secure a comfortable win against Championship side Millwall in the FA Cup final.

The American continued his unconvincing performances during 2004-05, dropping in and out of the side as he failed to convince both Ferguson - and the United faithful - that he could be the long-term successor to the legendary Peter Schmeichel.

Edwin van der Sar arrived the following summer and immediately went about doing just that. He became a commanding presence behind the Reds' talented back-four and undroppable from Ferguson's first choice lineup. Howard's brief stint in Manchester was effectively over.

Fortunately for the ex-North Jersey Imperials star, he had impressed David Moyes enough for the then Everton manager to sign him on loan for the 2006-07 season. He'd be the Toffees' No 1, too.

The faith shown in him by Moyes helped reinvigorate Howard's career on English soil. Gone was the nervous, error-prone keeper who appeared unable to cope with the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs, and in his place stood a man who relished the opportunity to pull on his gloves and perform each week.

On the up: Howard has revived his career at Everton and become one of the club's key players

Big impact: Howard even scored this incredible goal against Bolton at Goodison Park in January 2012

Howard found his best form under the Scot, helping the Merseyside club qualify for the Europa League, reach the 2009 FA Cup final and consistently challenge towards the top end of the Premier League after making his move permanent a year after signing on loan.

Along with Tim Cahill, Mikel Arteta and Phil Jagielka, he is viewed by many Evertonians as one of the most shrewd signings of Moyes' 11 years in charge. Some would even describe him as the club's best keeper since Neville Southall graced the blue half of Merseyside during the 1980s and 90s.

That faith was tested in Moyes' final season at the helm when, uncharacteristically, he made a number of errors which cost Everton valuable points in their hunt for fourth place.

A weak Kenwyne Jones header was conceded in a draw with Stoke and Fulham's Bryan Ruiz was allowed to score a lacklustre free-kick at Craven Cottage. In total, Howard could be directly blamed for at least five point-costing goals.

When Roberto Martinez took over Moyes last summer, it appeared as if Everton's new boss was already planning for life without the veteran in his squad.

No way through: Howard keeps out a low effort from Belgium's Divock Origi at the Arena Fonte Nova

Still got it: Howard keeps out an effort from Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud during a 1-1 draw last season

Joel Robles, a player Martinez had on loan during his time at Wigan, was signed from Atletico Madrid on a five-year deal. At just 23 when he signed, the Spaniard looked every inch like Howard's replacement.

Fast forward almost a year and the picture is very different. Robles featured in just two Premier League fixtures last season as Howard - now in his mid-thirties - enjoyed his most consistent season in between the sticks.

He ended the campaign with 15 top-flight clean sheets, a fifth place finish and a two-year extension on his contract, keeping him on Merseyside until at least 2018. He'll be 39 when his deal runs out.

After watching Howard in action over the past year, Everton fans won't have been too surprised to see their player shine on the biggest stage of them all. Incredibly, he seems to be improving the older he gets.

If he can continue the trend at club level, a final farewell in Russia in four years' time might not be such a far-fetched prospect for America's latest hero.
