He is the boss of one of the world's biggest internet giants.

And so it was only natural that Google chief Eric Schmidt would attract a host of stars to his new book launch.

A host of celebrities, entrepreneurs and even Royals turned up to the launch of 'The New Digital Age' book launch at Lou Lou's in London.

Those in attendance included  Princess Beatrice , James Middleton - the younger brother of Kate and Pippa Middleton -  and supermodel Lily Cole.

Sarah Duchess of York also made an appearance at the star-studded bash.

The book looks at what the future holds as the digital revolution develops. Schmidt and his co-author Jared Cohen outline what awaits the world in the coming decades.

Earlier this week, the Google boss said he was 'perplexed' by the debate over the company's tax affairs.

The internet giant's executive chairman insisted the company paid everything it was legally required to in the UK and suggested it was up to the Government to change the law if it wanted more from the firm.

Google has come under fire over reports that it paid only £10 million in corporation tax in the UK between 2006 and 2011, despite revenues of £11.9 billion.

Mr Schmidt told BBC Radio 4's Start the Week: 'What we are doing is legal. I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for quite some time because I view taxes as not optional.

'I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate. You pay the taxes.

'If the British system changes the tax laws then we will comply. If the taxes go up we will pay more, if they go down we will pay less. That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom.'

Much of the company's UK profits are understood to be routed through Ireland.

Mr Schmidt was hauled before the public accounts committee earlier this month to account for Google's tax affairs after MPs were unhappy with the company's previous evidence.
