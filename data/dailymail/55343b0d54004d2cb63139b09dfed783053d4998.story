David Cameron's bid to legislate for a referendum on Britain leaving the European Union has been blocked by the Lib Dems, MailOnline can reveal.

The Prime Minister is understood to have urged Nick Clegg to give the people a say on Europe, but the Lib Dem leader refused to give government time for the EU Referendum Bill to pass through the Commons.

Mr Cameron has pinned his hopes on the promise of an in-out vote to win back Ukip supporters, but support for Nigel Farage's party has soared to a new record high.

David Cameron urged Nick Clegg to clear the way for the EU Referendum Bill to become law, but the pleas were rejected, the Tories claim

The coalition is bitterly divided on the idea of staging a referendum on Britain remaining in the bloc of 28 European countries.

Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the next election he will renegotiate membership of the EU before staging in an in-out vote by 2017.

The Tories were hoping to use a backbench bill to pass the necessary legislation, but claim the move has been scuppered by Mr Clegg.

The Lib Dems demanded that in exchange for support for the EU referendum the Tories had to allow a backbench bill to curb the bedroom tax to continue. 

Tory MP Bob Neill, who was taking the Bill through Parliament, told MailOnline: 'The Lib Dems have killed off our chances of putting into law, this side of an election, an in out EU referendum by 2017.

'They didn't have the guts to vote against an EU referendum in the House of Commons. Instead they have used Westminster tricks to try to deny the British people a say on their membership of the EU.'

The row centres on the need for a money resolution to be granted to allow the EU Referendum Bill to make progress through the Commons.

The Lib Dems granted the resolution for a similar Bill last year, but the Tories say it has been refused this time.

It is claimed Mr Clegg demanded changes to housing benefit – dubbed the 'bedroom tax' – as a price for agreement to allow the EU Bill to continue.

Tory MP Bob Neill, who was trying to pass a law for an EU referendum, blamed the Lib Dems for blocking its passage through Parliament

The Lib Dems say the Tories offered to grant a money resolution to Lib Dem MP Andrew George's Bill on the bedroom tax, but  demanded both a money resolution and government time for Mr Neill’s backbench bill on the EU referendum.

Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Malcolm Bruce said: 'There is a completely reasonable deal on the table here – each party gets a money bill for a Private Member's Bill they feel strongly about.'

A senior Liberal Democrat source added: 'But the Tories are putting forward a proposal they know for certain will be turned down by the Lib Dems – a completely unfair deal.

'They know we are not about to sign up to their bill being given government time when it is neither the Liberal Democrats position, nor the Coalition Government's, especially when they are not prepared to offer anything in return. The Coalition Government is a two-way street.

'The Liberal Democrats were never going to block their referendum bill. We were happy to allow them to try and get it passed in the House of Commons. 

'But the truth is they have folded like a cheap deck chair and are trying to make us take the blame by adding ridiculous conditions they knew we would not and could not accept.

'The only logical conclusion that can be reached is that the Tories don't really want their bill to pass and are trying to set the Lib Dems up as the scapegoats. Why else would they put forward a proposal they know cannot be agreed?'

The Conservatives say the Lib Dem policy to ease the pressure of the benefits changes would cost £1billion. But a senior Lib Dem source said it would only cost £300million.

Mr Neill added: 'This is will now be a major issue at the general election. Two parties – Labour and Lib Dems – have done everything they can to stop a referendum.

'Ukip aren't able to offer a referendum and a vote for them makes the prospect of a Labour government led by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who don't want a referendum, more likely.

'Only David Cameron and the Conservatives are offering a renegotiation followed by an in-out referendum by 2017 if we are returned to office after the general election.'

A new poll today showed support for Ukip has surged to a record level of support in the wake of Brussels' demands for an extra £1.7billion from Britain.

Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June

Some 19 per cent of people now say they will back Nigel Farage's party, twice the level seen early last year.

Mr Farage last night said the EU should be told to 'get stuffed' and said the demand had been a 'gift' to his party.

The rise of Ukip has come at the expense of both the main parties, with Labour slumped at the lowest level of support since Ed Miliband became leader.

The Tories and Labour are neck and neck on just 30 per cent, the ComRes survey for The Independent showed.

Senior Tories have pleaded with even voters who want to leave the European Union to stay with the Tories.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'If you want change in Europe, if you want a referendum on Europe, if you are against Europe and want to leave, the only party that will give you that vote is the Conservatives.'
