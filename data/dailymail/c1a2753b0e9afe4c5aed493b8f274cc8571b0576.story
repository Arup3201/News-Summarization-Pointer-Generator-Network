A bus driver who tried to avoid a being caught out in a drugs test by using his wife's urine got busted when officials told him, 'Congratulations, you're pregnant.'

The driver was selected along with colleagues from the General Transportation Authority for the standard test to detect if they had been using narcotics.

Egypt is gripped by a wave of painkiller addiction, with the prescription opiate tramadol particularly popular among workers who sometimes need at least two jobs to get by.

To avoid being rumbled for his own drug use the driver, whose name has not been revealed, tried to pass off his wife's urine as his own when his turn came to give a sample.

What he didn't realise is that his wife was two months pregnant, reports the BBC's News From Elsewhere blog, citing Egyptian news website Al-Yawm al-Sabi.

Tamer Amin, a presenter on Egyptian politics show Bottom Line, says officials asked the driver to confirm the sample was his own before they revealed the result.

When he did, they reportedly told him: 'Congratulations, you're pregnant.'

'This story despite being funny has several lessons,' the BBC quotes Mr Amin as saying. 'First, that drugs have become available to many and have become as common as cigarettes. This is a calamity.'

Danger: More than 12,000 people die on the roads in Egypt every year, according to the World Health Organisation, and one fifth of those killed are pedestrians

More than 12,000 people die on the roads in Egypt every year, according to the World Health Organisation. That gives the country a road traffic fatality rate of 42 deaths a year per 100,000 population.

One fifth of those killed are pedestrians.

Drug use, meanwhile, is on the rise. The cheap, medical-grade painkiller tramadol has found massive popularity for its energising properties.

In Egypt's floundering economy, the drug can ease the pain of stressed employees who work two jobs to survive and hardly have any sleep, reported Al Jazeera last year.

Since the farce with the 'pregnant' bus driver, Egypt's transport authority says it will require a blood test as well as a urine test to prevent others giving fake samples.
