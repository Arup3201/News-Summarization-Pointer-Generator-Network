The wrecked fuselage of the AirAsia jet at the bottom of the Java Sea is to be raised to the surface with special balloons after rough conditions again prevented divers from searching for trapped bodies on Saturday.

It was the third attempt by divers to swim the 30m down to the main body of the aircraft which is believed to contain most of the bodies of the passengers.

One more body was recovered from the sea's surface today - bringing the total found to 51 - but experts believe scores of others are still strapped to their seats inside the wreckage. 

It comes one week after investigators searching for black boxes in the crashed AirAsia plane lifted the tail portion out of the Java Sea on Saturday, two weeks after it went down, killing all 162 people on board.

As officials carried the coffins of victims today, others were preparing to raise the wrecked fuselage of the AirAsia jet to the surface with special balloons

After today's diving failure, caused by strong underwater currents and poor visibility, search officials say they will now attempt to raise the fuselage to the surface using special balloons before it is lifted by cranes onto a ship.

'We got down a little way, but then it became dangerous to continue to dive further,' said Mr Henry Bambang Soelistyo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency.

'But we did discover more wreckage down there, as well as what looked like passenger seats with bodies in them.  

'We have also seen what we suspect is the cockpit and an engine, so there's a lot of work to be done.'

Divers have already recovered the vital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder and experts in Jakarta have started to download the data.

The Airbus, with 162 people on board, crashed while flying from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on December 28.

It is believed bad weather caused the crash.

Mr Soelistyo said he hoped the task of raising the fuselage could begin within days.

But experts have warned it will be a painstaking task, considering the condition of the bodies. 

After the tail was lifted from the ocean last Saturday, it was not immediately clear if the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were still inside the tail or had been detached when the Airbus A320 plummeted into the sea Dec. 28. Their recovery is essential to finding out why it crashed.

The tail was hoisted from a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) using inflatable bags that were attached to the rear of the aircraft and a crane to lift it onto a rescue ship.

Intermittent underwater ping-like sounds were picked up Friday about a kilometer (half mile) from where the tail was located, but it was unclear if they were coming from the recorders located in the back of the aircraft. It was possible the signals were coming from another source.

No metal was detected at the ping location, and Nurcahyo Utomo, a National Commission for Transportation Safety investigator, said the sounds could not be confirmed.  

Footage recently emerged showing Indonesian military divers investigating the submerged tail of doomed AirAsia flight 8501, as search and rescue teams are hopeful that  the black box from the plane's wreckage has been located.

Having located the tail of the plane, search teams began pressing ahead with their efforts to find the black box and retrieve bodies from the wreckage, and on Friday afternoon reported detecting 'pings' from the flight data recorder.

But Suyadi Bambang Supriyadi, director of operations of Indonesia's search-and-rescue agency, said pings detected about 1km southwest of the wreckage suggest the black box may be located elsewhere, reports Business Spectator.

The underwater searches ended before dusk last Friday, after divers were unable to find the black box.

Indonesian authorities have warned that the black box, which is located in the tail in the Airbus A320-200, may have become separated during the crash. 

Footage released by Indonesian authorities shows divers surrounding the submerged wreck, shining torches into the badly damaged hull, 30 metres under the surface of the Java Sea.

The flight data recorder, or black box, which is located in the back end of the plane, could prove crucial to determining the cause of the December 28 crash that killed all 168 people on board. 

Lifting balloons were loaded onto helicopters in preparation of recovery efforts to lift the tail out of the Java Sea, despite worries that the black box may have been separated from the tail during the crash.

The footage was captured by the divers despite poor weather and murky water which has been hampering recovery efforts.
