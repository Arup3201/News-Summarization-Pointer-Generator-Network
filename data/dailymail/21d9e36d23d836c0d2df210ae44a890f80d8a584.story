A former student at a Roman Catholic college has filed a lawsuit against the school, after ending up with a roommate who she says repeatedly made love with her boyfriend in their shared room.

Lindsay Blankmeyer, 21, claims the college in Easton, Massachusetts
didn't do enough to help her when she complained about her roommate Laura Sidla's overactive sex-life.

Blankmeyer suffered from depression and attention deficit disorder before she enrolled at Stonehill College, the lawsuit alleges, but was driven into a suicidal depression after school officials failed to offer her reasonable alternative accommodation.

Blankmeyer, now a marketing executive, 
according to her Linked in profile, said her roommate had sex with her 
boyfriend while she was trying to sleep just feet away and also 
participated in 'sexually inappropriate video chatting' while Blankmeyer
was in the dorm room.

After trying unsuccessfully to persuade school officials to force her roommate to move out or to give her an acceptable private room, Blankmeyer ended up living at a hotel, the lawsuit said.

'Stonehill refused Lindsay's request for
a single room and in the following weeks and months Lindsay fell into a
dark and suicidal depression requiring her to take a leave of absence 
from school and undergo extensive psychiatric and medical treatment,' 
the lawsuit states.

Blankmeyer eventually completed her final semester of school at her home in New York and received a bachelor's of arts degree in Sept 2011. Her current Twitter profile says she is obsessed with all things Disney.

Blankmeyer enrolled as a freshman in 2007 but the lawsuit said problems began her senior year.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston earlier this week, seeks unspecified damages.

Stonehill spokeswoman Kristen Magda 
said the college responded 'swiftly and professionally' to Blackmeyer's 
complaints about her roommate, first trying to resolve the dispute 
through mediation with a residence director, then by giving Blankmeyer 
'multiple options' for campus housing, including a private room.

'At no time did the student notify college staff that her concerns involved her roommate's sexual activity,' Magda said Friday.

In the lawsuit, Blankmeyer says the college offered her two options, one was moving to another dorm where she would live in a room that was previously used as a study lounge and was a 'small cubicle-like space.'

The other option was to move to a dorm with a reputation as a 'party dorm' to live with a girl Blankmeyer did not know.
