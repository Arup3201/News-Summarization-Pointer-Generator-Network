Praise: Which? has sided with pensions experts and campaigners for the elderly to back George Osborne's reforms

Britain’s consumer watchdog Which? has joined up with Saga and pension experts to praise George Osborne’s people power reforms, saying they will ‘transform the way people of all ages save for their future’.

In a rare intervention into the political arena, the consumer champion claimed the measures will introduce ‘genuine flexibility and choice for millions of people planning for their retirement’.

Some Labour politicians have suggested that pensioners could not be trusted to spend their money wisely. However Which? has come together with over-50s group Saga as well as Aegon – one of the UK’s largest insurers – and the country’s most prominent pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann to praise the ‘landmark reforms’.

In a letter to the Daily Mail, the experts say Mr Osborne’s decision that retirees should no longer have to buy an annuity have their ‘wholehearted support’ because they mean treating people ‘like grown-ups’. And they pointedly back the Chancellor’s call for people to spend their pension pot as they wish.

The endorsement is significant as it is rare for Which? to take sides in a political battle. The letter has been signed by Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith, Adrian Grace the boss of Aegon, Andrew Goodsell of Saga and Dr Altmann.

In an attack on the Labour politicians who claimed people would waste their money, the experts wrote: ‘Some say people can’t be trusted to make decisions about how to invest their pensions savings. We disagree.

‘It is good that people who have saved all their lives will now be able to choose for themselves how to access their pension and whether or not to buy an annuity.’

The letter contradicts claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that the changes will make annuities – for those who do choose to buy them – worth even less in future.

Support: Dr Ross Altmann, the country's foremost pensions expert, also signed the letter

‘Ending the captive market for annuities will be good for competition, and spur the pensions industry to provide more products and better value,’ the experts insisted, adding: ‘It’s good to see the Government encouraging saving and treating people like grown-ups.’

Dr Altmann also praised the Mail for campaigning to help savers, saying: ‘I do believe the Mail made an enormous difference.’

Last night George Osborne thanked the group for their unusual intervention, saying: ‘This impressive letter confirms that the pensions reforms in my Budget have struck a chord. I’m grateful for the very positive response from the consumer groups and savings industry.’

And David Cameron taunted Labour for its uncertain response to the reforms, branding Ed Miliband’s team ‘all over the place’. The Prime Minister said: ‘While Labour dither and flail around for ideas, we have made long-term changes that will give millions greater security in old age.

‘This is about backing those who work hard, save and do the right thing. And it’s about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place.’

Labour MPs demanded that Ed Miliband beef up his economic policies last night after his ‘lame’ response to the Budget gave the Tories a poll bounce.

And in further dispiriting news for the Labour chief, a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘weirdest’ party leader in Britain.

The YouGov poll for BuzzFeed showed that 41 per cent think Mr Miliband is either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’, while 34 per cent thinks the same of Nick Clegg and only 27 per cent believe that David Cameron is weird.

Lame response: Ed Miliband has faced criticism for his response to the Budget

The survey, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school, a third think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest-working pupil.

But the more pressing concern for Labour MPs is that another YouGov opinion poll put the Tories on 36 points, just one point behind Labour, while a Survation poll had the Conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind.

And Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were still trailing far behind the Conservatives when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy.

A senior Labour frontbencher said: ‘Our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters. Ed’s lame response has not helped with that.

‘Some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory. This poll should be a wake-up call.’
