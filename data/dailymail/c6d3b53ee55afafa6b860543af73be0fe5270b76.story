A man was stunned when he looked out his flat window on Friday evening and caught a couple brazenly having sex in the building opposite him. 

The pair, who have yet to be identified, had not pulled the window blinds in their Nottingham city centre office and were in a full view of residents in the building.

The shocked onlooker, who did not want to be named, filmed the entire encounter.

He said the other residents in his building were also watching the scene unfold.

He said: 'She was really good looking.

'She walked into the office and started stripping off, then she started ripping his clothes off and performed a sex act on him.

'They then started having full-blown sex over his chair and then his desk.

He said that he filmed the pair for twenty minutes and the couple 'didn’t care that everyone in my building was staring at them.'

In the video, the man's suit can be seen hanging on the chair. At one point the man looks out the window but doesn’t seem to mind or perhaps notice, the watching audience.

The woman is thought to be in her late 20s and has long dark hair. The man is thought to be in his early 30s, had balding light brown hair and was wearing a suit.

Friday saw temperatures soar to the mid-twenties as Britain entered a heat wave.
