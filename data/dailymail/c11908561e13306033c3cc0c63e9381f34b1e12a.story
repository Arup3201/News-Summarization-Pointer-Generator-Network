An Indian village in the popular Indian tourist destination of Goa has clamped down on couples kissing in public, claiming the sight of such 'obscene' behaviour offends locals.

Salvador de Mundo, a beautiful fishing village in the western coastal state, imposed a ban on public displays of affection after a unanimously passed a resolution by the village parliament.

The village, eight miles north of Goa's capital Panaji, has put up signs warning holidaymakers against engaging in PDAs with the council saying they were forced into the action by a lack of a response from local authorities. 

The resolution also 'banned public drinking and playing loud music.'

'We have adopted this resolution following complaints from villagers about couples kissing in public. This was the only way to put an end to it,' deputy village chief Reena Fernandes told AFP.

She however declined to comment on whether punitive action will be taken against potential violators of the bylaws.

'We have serene beaches which attract tourists in a big way. Several times we saw couples acting indecently which irked us,' villager Savio Rebeiro told AFP. 

Goa's beaches have long been a haven for millions of tourists drawn mostly from the West, but a string of controversial statements by local politicians has dented its tourist-friendly image.

The state is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which this week barred its female employees from wearing jeans and sleeveless tops in the office.

India as a whole prohibits obscene acts in public. And although its law don't define 'obscene' in great detail, it definitely includes PDAs. 

Kissing in public, if enforced, can lead to fines or even imprisonment for up to three months.

With Salvador de Mundo clamping down on kissing in the streets, here are some other places where visitors should refrain from kissing, or even holding hands in some cases, in public. 

The UAE is the most relaxed of the Gulf Arab nations but kissing in public is still forbidden and can result in deportation, fines or jail

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES 

Even though Dubai is the most relaxed of the Gulf Arab countries, kissing in public is still strictly illegal and could see offenders deported or jailed.

Ahead of last year's festive season the UAE's British embassy released a take on the 'Twas the Night Before Christmas poem to raise awareness of what is and isn't acceptable in public there.

“No holding of hands or Christmas kisses; under the mistletoe, despite amorous wishes,” it said.

Holding hands in public is also frowned upon and public intoxication is very much a no-no. Sex on the beach, the act rather than the cocktail, will definitely get you put in jail.

CHINA

While larger cities with high Western populations may be more tolerant than other areas, couples holding hands or kissing in public goes against the primary values of Buddhism or Confucianism observed in the country.

There has even previously been a three foot rule for separation between members of the opposite sex - an extreme version of the balloon between teens at a school dance - but PDAs are still more or less off limits. For some, kissing is considered among most intimate of acts meant only for behind closed doors. 

INDONESIA

The highly controversial 'Bill on Pornography' prohibits by law those engaging in pornography and pornoaction - a word invented to mean indecent acts. This also includes public displays of affection including kissing. 

The law aside, kissing in public deeply offends some locals, especially the older generation, in the most populous Muslim country in the world. 

Couples caught kissing too vigorously in public can be prosecuted and spend up to five years in jail. 

In saying this, Balinese Hindus recently celebrated their annual Nyepi Day of Silence in which thousands of locals gather in the streets to take part in a kissing ritual known as omed omedan that is supposed to bring fortune for the coming year.

JAPAN

While not forbidden by law, kissing in public just isn't done in Japan.

A bow to a friend or family member is far more appropriate than a kiss on the cheek and in general terms kissing passionately is reserved for behind closed doors.

Being a nation renowned for being incredibly polite, it only makes sense to be the same back. 

EGYPT

As a predominantly Muslim country, Egypt too frown on kissing in public and even holding hands by the opposite sex isn't appreciated. Indecency laws can be used by police, should they choose to, for overzealous displays of affection and the drinking of alcohol on the streets.
