The U.S. threatened targeted sanctions Sunday against those responsible for the worsening sectarian violence in the Central African Republic as at least eight died in fresh clashes.

Mob violence in the capital Bangui claimed eight lives Sunday as Christian militia attacked and looted predominantly Muslim neighborhoods, with fighting between religious groups intensifying. On Friday a former Muslim minister was hacked to death by armed groups.

John Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, said 
Washington was considering ‘targeted sanctions against those who further
 destabilize the situation, or pursue their own selfish ends by abetting
 or encouraging the violence’.

He called on the country’s leaders to halt attacks on civilians and to condemn the violence.

Almost one million people have been displaced by fighting that began when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the majority Christian former French colony in March.

Christian groups, known as "anti-balaka", or anti-machete, have since taken up arms against Muslims, with the U.N. estimating that more than 2,000 people have been killed in the last ten months.

French and African Union peacekeeping troops have so failed to stem the bloodshed.

Kerry said the appointment of new interim President Catherine Samba-Panza last week was a chance to move forward. She replaced Michel Djotodia, a former Seleka leader, who stepped down earlier in the month because of intense international pressure.

Samba-Panza has said she will aim to start talks between armed groups and called for militia to lay down their weapons.

A witness told the Reuters News Agency he saw two burning bodies in Bagui’s Castor district. A convoy of heavily armed rebel Seleka Muslim fighters was seen leaving Bangui Sunday.

Almost 1 million people have been displaced by fighting that began when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the majority Christian former French colony in March.

"The youth in the neighbourhood saw the men here. They called them over, and they ran away. They caught them just right here and killed them," said a young man who gave his name only as Alex.

With the U.N. backed peacekeeping mission largely present in the capital, the violence has spread to the surrounding countryside.

Rights groups have warned of heavy fighting in the northwestern towns of Baoro and Bossemptle, where civilians were killed and hundreds of homes were burned last week.

"There is a huge risk of a major human tragedy because of the complete absence of any peacekeeping force," Amnesty senior crisis adviser Donatella Rovera said.

"Peacekeepers were sent to the CAR with a clear mandate: to protect civilian lives. They must not fail it."
