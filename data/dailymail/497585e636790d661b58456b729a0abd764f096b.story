'I raced in to the bedroom and woke my wife and told her that we'd won Oz Lotto! She said to me, 'This doesn't happen to us!' and I said, 'Well it just did!'

The winning Oz Lotto entry was purchased from Mittagong Newsagency, 4 Princess Street in central Mittagong.

The man said he couldn't believe his luck when he read the winning numbers.

'I checked my ticket so many times from 11pm to 2am! I've had butterflies in my stomach ever since!'

'We've had some bad times and it's been a struggle for us. This first division win is going to make our lives so much easier! I'm not sure what we'll do with our windfall but we will invest some of it.'
