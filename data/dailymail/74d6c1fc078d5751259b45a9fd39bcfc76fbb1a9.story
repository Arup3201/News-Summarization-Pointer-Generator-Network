A senior editor of Rolling Stone has been forced to apologize after he tweeted a sarcastic and profane comment in response to the controversy stirred up by the cover of the latest issue featuring suspected Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

'I guess we should have drawn a d*** on Dzhokhar’s face or something?' Christian Hoard wrote on his Twitter account Wednesday morning.

The comment was later removed from the page, and Mr Hoard issued an apology Thursday for his online outburst.

Flippant: Hoard's tweet was in response to claims that the magazine glamorized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of the latest issue

Walk-back: Hoard later removed the offensive comment and issued an apology for his tweet - but not for the cover

‘Yesterday I made a sarcastic remark here in response to the RS cover controversy. I stand by our cover, but not my tweet - it was inappropriate and disrespectful. I'm sorry,’ the tweet said, according to Fox News.

Some Twitter users were dissatisfied with Hoard’s reaction to the scandal surrounding the cover.

‘Have some conviction. If you felt that way, let it stand. And the cover is awful,’ wrote Rob Katz.

The cover has sparked a nationwide backlash, with Rolling Stone's critics accusing the magazine of glamorizing the 19-year-old suspected terrorist by presenting him as a tousled-haired, brooding heartthrob in the mold of The Doors frontman Jim Morrison. 

Boston Mayor Tom Menino and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick accused the magazine of offering Tsarnaev 'celebrity treatment' and called the cover 'ill-conceived, at best' in a letter written by Menino to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner.

'The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them,' the letter stated.

Members of law enforcement have slammed Dzhokhar's softly lit 'selfie' featured in the issue now on on newsstands as an affront to anyone who has ever worn a uniform. 

One of them, Massachusetts State Police photographer Sgt Sean Murphy, was so incensed with Rolling Stone's glitzy treatment of the suspected bomber that he ended up leaking a series of previously unseen photos of Tsarnaev's dramatic arrest in Watertown, Mass.

The images, which Murphy handed over to Boston Magazine, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place.

Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 7,000 people having 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page

'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,' wrote Murphy in a posting on the magazine’s website.

'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.'

Murphy has been suspended for the unauthorized release of the gory images and is now facing a possible termination.

However, the police photographer’s plight has sparked an outpouring of support nationwide, which has led to the creation of a 'Save Sgt Sean Murphy' Facebook page.

By Saturday evening, the page has drawn more than 20,900 'likes.'

The social media portal has been launched with the intent to help save Murphy's job with the state police.

'He did what I think most of us would have liked to do or would have done had we had the same resources,' the creator of the page wrote.

Speaking to the New York Post Saturday, the woman behind the page explained that she has been deeply touched by the predicament of the officer, even though she does not know him personally. 

'It just hit me very hard that this poor guy, Sgt. Murphy, is getting reprimanded and could lose his job,' she said. 'What Sgt. Murphy did was something all of us wish we could have done.'

The beleaguered photographer’s champion, who identified herself to the Post as ‘Lisa,' said that she has been getting support from retired police officers, and most importantly, even from within the state police. 

According to the creator of the Facebook page, officials from the law enforcement agency have told her that while Sgt Murphy may face a penalty, he does not deserve to lose his job over his actions, which some cops have touted as heroic.

‘I'm getting people wanting to support his family or give him a job if he is fired, people offering free legal counsel,’ Lisa said.

Federal prosecutors, however, were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions.

'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,'
said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz, whose prosecutors
are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges, 17 of them
capital offenses.

'We have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking action internally in response.'

It is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260.

Murphy accompanied the Swat teams as 
they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where 
Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. 
history.

Within hours of releasing the photos, Murphy was relieved of his duties for a day.

A hearing is expected next week to 
determine whether Murphy will be formally suspended while the internal 
investigation is conducted, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio told the L.A. Times.

Murphy, who has worked in law enforcement for 25 years, has been ordered by his bosses to refrain from speaking to the media.

The Rolling Stone cover story on Tsarnaev was released online this week, a few days after his public court appearance.

Critics blasted the magazine, saying the cover shot of Tsarnaev was reminiscent of the magazine's flattering portrayals or rock legends such as Jim Morrison.

Rolling Stone claimed the story was part of its commitment to 'serious and thoughtful coverage' of important political and cultural issues, but several stores - including Walgreens and CVS - have refused to stock it.

'As a professional law-enforcement officer of 25 years, I believe that 
the image that was portrayed by Rolling Stone magazine was an insult to 
any person who has every worn a uniform of any color or any police 
organization or military branch, and the family members who have ever 
lost a loved one serving in the line of duty.

'The truth is that 
glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family 
members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an 
incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face
on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.

'I hope that the people who 
see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it 
gets.

'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a 
television show. Officer Dick Donohue almost gave his life. Officer Sean
Collier did give his life. These were real people, with real lives, 
with real families. And to have this cover dropped into Boston was 
hurtful to their memories and their families.

'I know from first-hand 
conversations that this Rolling Stone cover has kept many of them 
up - again. It’s irritated the wounds that will never heal - again. There is
nothing glamorous in bringing more pain to a grieving family.

'Photography
is very simple, it’s very basic. It brings us back to the cave. An 
image like this on the cover of Rolling Stone, we see it instantly as 
being wrong.

'What Rolling Stone did was wrong. This guy is evil. This is
the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of
Rolling Stone magazine.'
