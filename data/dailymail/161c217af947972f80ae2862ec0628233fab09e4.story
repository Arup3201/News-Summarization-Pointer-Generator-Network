Over the course of two games against Bolton from the Championship, Liverpool have seemingly invented new methods of not scoring. With just minutes of this replay left, however, Brendan Rodgers’ team finally found a way and Steven Gerrard’s dream of a birthday FA Cup final lives on.

Liverpool should have won the first game a week-and-half ago. Certainly they should have won this one much more easily than this.

However, having hit the frame of the goal three times, they were staring at an embarrassing defeat after Eidur Gudjohnsen’s second half penalty edged Bolton to the precipice of another 2015 FA Cup shock.

With a man advantage after the subsequent sending off of Bolton’s Neil Danns, Liverpool still looked as though they were heading out. With five minutes to go, however, Liverpool’s pressure – and their extra player – finally told.

First defender Emre Can – really a central midfield player – delivered a lovely chip over the Bolton defence for Raheem Sterling to volley in the equaliser. Then, three minutes later and with extra time seemingly inevitable, Phillipe Coutinho beat Bolton goalkeeper Andrew Lonergan with a right foot shot from 20 yards to hand Liverpool a fifth round game at Crystal Palace.

It was tough on Neil Lennon’s Bolton. Struggling with injuries, the home team played for 90 minutes with a defender – Matthew Mills – up front. Had they not had Danns sent off, they may won. At 1-0 Gudjohnsen spurned a really good headed chance and that also proved significant.

Liverpool, though, somehow found a way to win. It’s a habit they must now keep.

Rodgers spoke in the run-up to the game about the manner in which his team had improved in recent weeks. It was easy to see his point but it is not an observation that extends to Liverpool’s work in front of goal. They do have mitigating circumstances – their centre forwards are either not good enough or rarely fit enough – but they are in danger of becoming a little like the Arsenal side of a few seasons ago. Lovely to watch but inadequate at the art of scoring.

Rodgers spoke of justice being served after the final whistle.

'It was never a penalty,' he said.

His defender Martin Skrtel did dangle a leg in front of young Bolton prospect Zach Clough in the 59th minute, though, and had Liverpool gone on to lose Rodgers may well have found that he had few allies when it came to talk of miscarriages of justice.

Simply, Liverpool need to start taking a greater share of the chances they create. Wednesday night began with Gerrard shooting tamely at Lonergan when he perhaps should have scored and that pretty much set the tone for the evening.

Bolton were always in the game. They were never overrun. They were significantly second best in terms of possession and chances, though, and Liverpool should have been ahead by half-time.

In the wake of Gerrard’s early opportunity, there were similar sights of goal for Sterling, Coutinho and the disappointing Adam Lallana. Sometimes Lonergan saved while on occasion the wrong choice was made. 

There was over-elaboration, too, and some bad luck when Sterling curled a cute effort against the angle of post and bar from 12 yards.

In games like this, one of two things usually happens. Either the dam breaks and the water pours in or something goes awry at the other end. On this occasion it was the latter.

Liverpool spurned further chances early in the second half as Sterling over hit a simple pass to Lallana and then saw a curling shot touched over by the Bolton goalkeeper. He was also played clear on goal only for Dorian Dervite to tackle him.

Bolton’s penalty emerged out of nothing. A cute dart in to the box by Clough was all it took to tempt Skrtel and Gudjohnsen rolled the kick down the centre of the goal.

As Lennon pointed out afterwards, his team were not immediately besieged. Liverpool seemed shocked to be behind and left the goal scorer unmarked at the far post soon after. The header was straight at Simon Mignolet.

'That would have sealed the game,' said Lennon and he may have been right.

Subsequently the sending-off didn’t help the home side. Danns had already been booked for a first half lunge at Joe Allen and when he did it again he had to go.

It was this that finally gave Liverpool some fresh impetus and belief at a time when they looked as though they may be running short on both. The introduction of Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge helped also, the latter finally giving Liverpool’s attacking movements some genuine shape.

Still Liverpool couldn’t score, though. Sterling drove a shot goal wards only for it to rebound off a defender’s legs before David Wheater’s head diverted a Henderson shot on to a post and Lonergan’s fingertips touched a super Can shot on to the bar.

With the clock ticking, Rodgers had pushed Can forwards into midfield, his natural position. It proved a significant decision as the German’s chipped pass to Sterling was as precise as the subsequent finish. It may yet prove to be one of the most telling goals of Liverpool’s year.

As for the winner, it had a rather peculiar trajectory. So, though, has Liverpool’s season. It does, however, remain alive.
