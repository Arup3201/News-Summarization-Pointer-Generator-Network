A woman has launched a campaign for U.S. airlines to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplane cabins, after learning that her prickly friend could not travel with her by air.

Zoe Herman was shocked to discover that Heloise the hedgehog could only board a flight if she was stowed in the airplane's cargo hold - something she says is just not safe for the delicate little animal.

So now Zoe, from Portland, Oregon, is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow the prickly creatures to travel  in the cabin, just like small cats and dogs.

Zoe first discovered that airplane cabin's were a no-go for hedgehogs when she booked a flight across the States to visit her family for the holidays.

She quickly learned that most, if not all U.S. airlines, refuse to allow hedgehogs to travel in airplanes, and only a handful allow the prickly animals in cargo-holds. 

'They all said they were a danger of chewing out of their cages, which if you know anything about hedgehogs, they can't do that,' Zoe told KATU News.

'They don't have teeth that chew. They just kind of tear apart meat, that's it.'

Zoe's petition is directed at American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which she says harbor numerous misconceptions about hedgehogs.

On her campaign page, Zoe writes: 'Hedgehogs are very clean animals, and because they do not have fur, they have little to no dander. Unlike cats and dogs, it is uncommon to be allergic to a hedgehog.'

She also points out that hedgehogs do not make any noise, 'other than the occasional sneeze or itch'.

Zoe says Heloise is clean and quiet, so traveling with her in an airplane cabin should not be a problem at all

'They do not bark, meow, whine, growl, hiss, or scratch at their cages, as cats and dogs may do, Zoe adds. 

'In fact, hedgehogs sleep most of the time, meaning that traveling with a hedgehog is essentially like traveling with a very small, spiny stuffed animal.'

Hedgehogs, affectionately known as 'hedgies' by their fans, are an increasingly popular pet in the United States. However, they are actually illegal in some cities and states, including New York City, California, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, and Maine.
