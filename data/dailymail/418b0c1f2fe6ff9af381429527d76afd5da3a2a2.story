Can an app or website really boost your mental health? According to a new study the answer is yes.

The research specifically examined websites focusing on the practice of mindfulness - one of the biggest buzzwords of the last 12 months.

In psychology it involves consciously directing awareness. The practice is a type of meditation, but rather than clearing the mind, encourages us to acknowledge thoughts and allow them in and then to pass.

The trend has spurred a flurry of mindfulness apps and websites promising to improve stress levels using online tools. These include apps like Headspace (created by mindfulness guru Andy Puddicumbe) where you plug in and meditate to the sounds of Andy's voice guiding you through each step. Others use alarms to remind you to be mindful at strategic parts of the day (such as Mindfulness Bell). Â

The study, by Surrey University, carried out in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation, analysed whether tech-based therapies have real benefits on stress levels and found they can effectively reduce fatigue and negative work-related anxiety and also improve sleep quality.

Participants were randomly allocated to an online stress-reduction course or control 
group and levels of negative emotion, sleep and fatigue 
were measured pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 
three and six months later.

They found that the
 online interventions had a significant positive effect if the participants used the online tool for at least two hours a week.

The
 researchers said: 'Research has shown that there are significant 
numbers of people who are suffering from work-related fatigue and 
rumination.

'We ourselves have found evidence of the causal relationship 
between how people worry about work and their ability to recover and 
switch off effectively at the end of the day.

'Mindfulness
 helps people to develop awareness of their thoughts and emotions in a 
positive way.

'Online
 mindfulness interventions provide a cost-effective way to improve their health whilst helping 
reduce the long-term negative consequences of work stress.'

The study found that two hours a week of online 'mindfulness interventions' can do us a world of good
