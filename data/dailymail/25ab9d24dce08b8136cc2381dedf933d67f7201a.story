An account manager has quit her job to become a professional vlogger - after videos of her guinea pigs attracted  10million hits on YouTube.

Laura Mellors, 29, from Arnold, Notthingham, started making short films chronicling the daily antics of her pets in 2010 as a hobby.

But the video's popularity sky-rocketed and she now has a global following with 54,000 subscribers to her own YouTube channel.

After getting 10 million hits on YouTube, animal-lover Laura Mellors, pictured with Fozzie Bear and Brian, quit her job as an account manager for E.ON to focus on making videos about her products for guinea pigs

Laura has more than 100 videos on her Piggiepigpigs channel - generating 10 million hits - and she's sold more than 5,000 products through her website

The clips have been viewed more than 10million times and she is so well-known on the internet that she and her pets receive fan mail from animal lovers across the world.

Laura has now quit her job as an account manager with energy giant E.ON to concentrate on making more videos as well as selling guinea pig products.

Laura, who runs her Piggiepigpigs business from her home said: 'The response has been amazing and it's all down to the internet. 

Laura, pictured filming her American short hair guinea pigs Bobby and Billy, has promoted her fledgling business on YouTube over the past five years, after first showing a cage she had made for her furry friends on the video sharing platform in 2010

Laura and her husband James now share their home with seven guinea pigs, Billy, Bobby, Fozzy Bear, Brian, Bo, Alfie and Gizmo

'I was just bored one day so I made a film about my guinea pigs, Gus and Hercules.

'I'd bought a new cage which gives them different compartments and levels to climb on and I was intrigued to see how they would react to it.

'I uploaded the video to YouTube and within a few days I was getting really positive feedback and requests for more videos.

'Someone asked me to make a video showing them how to construct the cage so I did and it just snowballed.

Laura, who runs her Piggiepigpigs business from her home, said: 'The response has been amazing and it's all down to the internet'

The 29-year-old's Piggiepigpigs online shop sells pet beds and supplies, and offers information on keeping guinea pigs and hamsters

'My guinea pigs are now followed and sent fan mail. People ask what they're up to.

'When I was at the London Pet show last year a little girl and her mum even came up and asked for my autograph.

'The strangest thing happened last October. I'd told people on Facebook I was going to America on honeymoon and I got requests to meet them so I ended up meeting two families while I was there.'

Laura and her husband James, 30, a project engineer, now share their home with seven guinea pigs, Billy, Bobby, Fozzy Bear, Brian, Bo, Alfie and Gizmo.

She earns around £2,000-a-month from her YouTube videos as well as selling guinea pig goods through her online shop.

Laura added: 'At the moment I work two or three days a week making videos and updating the guinea pigs' updates on Twitter and Facebook.

'If I don't post regular updates I get messages from people asking if the guinea pigs are okay.

'People seem to love the videos. It's a joy to do something for a living which is also a passion.'
