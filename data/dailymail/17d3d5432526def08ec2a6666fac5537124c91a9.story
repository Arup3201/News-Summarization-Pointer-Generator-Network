The son of a famous Boston Red Sox announcer who is accused of stabbing to death his girlfriend in August has broken his silence to announce his innocence.

'How dumb would I have to be? I loved her, I still love her,' he said in his first interview since the attack where police say he pinned 27-year-old Jennifer Martel to the patio and stabbed her repeatedly as their 5-year-old daughter Arianna watched.

The bulky 34-year-old maintains his innocence despite first hand accounts of Remy committing the act and despite his having been covered in blood as police dragged him from the scene of the murder.

Jared Remy is accused of stabbing to death his 27-year-old girlfriend last August while their 5-year-old daughter looked on at their Boston home

Jennifer Martel, 27, was stabbed multiple times and bled to death on August 15. Her family says she was very close to escaping the abusive relationship

'No,' was Remy's blunt response when a Boston Herald reporter asked if he killed the mother of his daughter. 'That’s ridiculous.'

Remy is the son of Red Sox second baseman turned sports announcer Jerry Remy.

When he spoke to the Herald reporter over the weekend, it was the first time he'd spoken publicly or even met with anyone since his August 15 arrest for the bloody murder.

That includes his family.

'I’m just trying to get adjusted here,' Remy said. 'I’m sure they’re not thrilled with me right now.'

Remy's daughter has been in state custody since after the murder.

'She’s in a good place. She has a dog to play with, which makes me happy because she loves animals. I’m hoping she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' he said.

While both his and Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of Arianna, Remy said he'd prefer his parents to get custody because of their financial means.

He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars.

'If she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said.

While Remy admitted his past steroid abuse, he said he'd stopped using them. 'I wasn’t currently taking them,' he said.

Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother.

'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault. They don’t need to be dragged down in this, too,' he said.

Remy is slated to the arraigned this week.

Longtime Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy has opened
up about the allegations that his son stabbed to death his girlfriend, saying that
his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable.

In a statement released through his Twitter account , Remy said he and his wife are ‘heartbroken’ over the death of
Jennifer Martel. 

Jennifer Martel's five-year-old daughter Ariana witnessed her mother's brutal murder last August

‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy
wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse
over this senseless and tragic act.’

Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex
 at around 9.30pm August 15 following multiple 911 calls. They found 
Martel bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds.

Middlesex
 Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in 
the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to 
the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly.

'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.'

Remy was arrested at the scene after he held
 his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was 
soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an 
engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket.

Just
 feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab 
wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A 
blue cloth covered her face.

Witnesses: Neighbors saw Remy, left, repeatedly stabbing Martel, right with the couple's daughter

'There
 was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the 
victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was 
motionless, not breathing.'

Remy, who in 2005 
admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District 
Court to face allegations that he assaulted Martel in a domestic 
violence incident not long before the murder. He allegedly threw her against a mirror.

He was released on personal 
recognizance, and Ryan said that 
the bail recommendation made by her office was based, in part, on a 
conversation with Martel.

'The bail recommendation was based on a totality of circumstances,' Ryan said.

She
 added: 'A (bail) request was made based on the 
information that we had on Wednesday. Obviously and tragically, there is
 different information today, Friday morning.'

Famous father: Jerry Remy and his wife have petitioned for custody of their 5-year-old granddaughter

History: Remy was released from jail for assaulting Martel just two days before her murder

Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend.

'She
 said, "I was planning my escape,"' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on
 Wednesday. She said, "Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape."'

Her mother is furious Remy was released after the assault and blames the blunder for her daughter's death.

'(Prosecutors) did not do their job,' Patty Martel said. 'They failed. She would be alive today if they had put him away.'

Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing.

'She
 went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' 
she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on 
him.'

At least one 
neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid 
and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved 
his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said.

'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.'

Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio.

Remy pleaded not guilty and 
has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter 
Bella, did not contest the bail order.

Police found Miss Martel dying from multiple stab wounds at the Windsor Village apartment complex in Waltham, Massachusetts last summer

Remy has maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of his girlfriend last year

'I've been in contact with the Remys. They are devastated, he said. 'This is a very sad and tragic day for two families.'

Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna.

'She
 had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on 
getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to
 marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would
 do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in 
the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it 
was this.'

She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter.

'I
 don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first
 thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his 
daughter for the rest of her life.'

A neighbor told Boston.com: 'It's creepy, it's a couple hundred yards from my window,' as Waltham police and State Police investigated the bloody 
crime scene. 'The little girl was literally selling lemonade the other 
day.'

Remy suffered an unspecified injury 
that wasn't self-inflicted, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital
 and released before the arraignment.

Another neighbor described Remy as a very nice guy, though he had 15 prior cases out of Waltham District Court between 1998-2010, according to the Boston Herald.

In 2009, Remy, then a security guard 
for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was 
fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he 
denied supplying steroids to his coworker.

The couple's daughter was unhurt is now in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. They also had two pitbulls.
