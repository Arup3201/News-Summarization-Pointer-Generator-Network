Police are searching for the body of a Florida woman who they believe drowned in a river after apparently being pushed into the water by her boyfriend.

Witnesses told deputies that the victim, an African American female in her late teens, was hesitant to jump, because she could not swim, but she was pushed off a bridge in Florida.

The woman who has not yet been identified, was standing on Morgan Park Bridge in Arcadia, on Sunday with her boyfriend, who has been identified as 28-year-old Mark Allan Huntley.

Other park goers began jumping into the Peace River to 
escape the summer heat, according to Sam Williamson, Chief Deputy of the
DeSoto County Sheriff’s Department, according to ABC News. 

When the woman did not re-surface after being pushed into the water, Huntley and another man later identified as Andrew Skevington, jumped in after her.

Although she briefly managed to grab a pylon, she then disappeared underwater and hasn’t been seen since, Mr Williamson said.

According to the arrest report, seen by Wink News, after being unable to save the struggling victim they gathered up her possessions and left.

Authorities found Huntley hitchhiking along Highway 70, trying to get back to Tampa.

'What started out as a playful type thing on the bridge turned into manslaughter because they pushed this girl who couldn’t swim into the river,' Williamson said.

'It was maybe an accident and now is more sinister.'

Huntley is on probation on charges from Hillsborough County and will be charged with manslaughter and violation of probation.

Andrew Skevington, the third person involved, has been arrested and charged with manslaughter.

The 28-year-old suspect was with the woman when she and Huntley jumped from the bridge.
