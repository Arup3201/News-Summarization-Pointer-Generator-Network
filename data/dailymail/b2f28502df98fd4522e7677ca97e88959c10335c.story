It could be the plot from a Hollywood 
movie: After exhausting the Earth's supply of natural resources, 
global corporations turn to space to replenish their stockpile of raw 
materials.

However the stuff of science fiction could soon become a reality following the revelation of proposals
to begin mining asteroids to guarantee the human race's prosperity.

A
team of scientists are to unveil plans for the new space venture - and the project has the backing of Hollywood film maker and 
explorer James Cameron.

As well as the Hollywood director, other investors include chiefs from internet giant Google and a former software architect for computer corporation Microsoft.

Details of the proposed space mission are to be officially launched on Tuesday, by start-up company Planetary Resources.

The proposals will be unveiled at a press conference at the Museum of Flight in Seattle which will also be available to view online.

The company's objectives are to be twofold: the mining of natural resources and space exploration, with the aim of selling the raw materials it extracts from the asteroids and adding trillions of dollars to the global GDP.

Untapped resource: NASA scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural resources

Space man: Entrepreneur Peter Diamandis

The shortage of sources for raw 
materials on the planet has caused global inflation to spike in recent 
years causing tensions to rise between nations, experts have said.

NASA
scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in 
asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron 
and platinum - could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural 
resources.

Space entrepreneurs Peter Diamandis and Eric Anderson are just two of the names behind Planetary Resource. In a press release, the company announced its intentions to create 'a new industry in space and a new definition 
of natural resources'.

Diamandis and Anderson - both known for their aspirations for commercial space exploration - will host the launch event along with two former NASA officials.

A driving force behind the Ansari 
X-Prize competition to spur on non-goverment space flight, Diamandis has
made no secret of his goal to one day become an asteroid miner.

In an interview earlier this year with Forbes magazine, he said: 'The earth is a crumb in a supermarket of resources.

'Now we finally have the technology to
extract resources outside earth for the benefit of humanity without 
having to rape and pillage our planet.'

Hollywood film maker James Cameron is no stranger to daring exploration.

Just
last month the director of Titanic and Avatar became the first solo 
diver toÂ  reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep - the deepest point on
Earth.

Radical concept, but old idea: Experts believe it is only now that we have the ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth asteroids

It might seem like a radical concept, but scientists have been toying with the idea of mining asteroids for their natural resources for longer than the space program has been running.

Experts believe it is only now that we have the technology and ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth asteroids (NEA).

The mining could yield a large amount of water - frozen inside the asteroids - oxygen and metals which could not only be brought back to Earth but could help further space exploration by allowing humans to fuel spacecraft and build space stations.

Nasa believes capturing placing an NEA 
in lunar orbit could provide a unique, meaningful and easy-to-reach 
destination for exploration by astronaut crews in the next decade.

It is only now that the 
sufficiently-powerful electric propulsion systems necessary to transport
a captured NEA are becoming available.

Mining asteroids could take several forms. This includes sending humans in a 
spacecraft to an asteroid to explore and mine it.

Another possible scenario could involve launching a robotic spacecraft to either to mine an 
asteroid directly or transport it closer to Earth so it could be reached by humans more easily.

Extracting raw materials, such as iron and nickel, from the space rocks is a possibility that has been discussed for decades.

However, the obstacles for such a mission has always been the cost, sufficient scientific expertise and technical prowess.

It could cost tens of billions of dollars - and could take well over a decade - for astronauts to successfully land on an asteroid, NASA experts have said in the past.
