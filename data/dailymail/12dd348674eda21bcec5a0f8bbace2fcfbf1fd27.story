A member of the firing squad assigned to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman has revealed what it is like to pull the trigger.

The revelations come as Chan's fiancee Febyanti Herewila saw the convicted drug smuggler for the first time after he was transferred to Nusakambangan in Central Java for his execution.

Chan's brother, Michael, gave up his place on the boat from Cilacap - the port closest to Indonesia's 'Death Island' - so she could visit him, Fairfax Media reported.

Andrew Chan's fiancee Febyanti Herewila visited the convicted drug smuggler for the first time since his transfer to Nusakambangan in Central Java

Ms Herewila, who is known as Feby, was one of the last people who visited Chan last Tuesday before he and Sukuraman were transported in armoured cars to the island.

She and Michael tried to seek out a final visit before Chan's transfer but were unsuccessful.

With Chan and Sukuraman held in semi-isolation cells, the pair are only allowed three visitors each per day, a source close to the family told Daily Mail Australia.

As the Bali Nine duo are just days away from their executions, a member of Indonesia's firing squad told News Corp taking a prisoner's life was something he would never forget.

It was revealed earlier this week that Chan had proposed to Febyanti Herewila after his clemency was rejected by the Indonesian president

The executioner was also part of the group that put to death five people at Nusakambangan on January 18.

The weapon of choice for the firing squad is a SS1 assault rifles, which is made in Indonesia and is standard issue to officers.

As a select number of the members on the squad are given live rounds, the executioner - who did not wish to be named - said he would never know if he delivered the final bullet that killed one of the inmates.

'As Brimob [Indonesia's answer to Australia's special forces], I have to do my job and I don't have any choice,' he told News Corp.

Chan's mother, Helen, also accompanied her future daughter-in-law to visit her son in Besi prison

She was one of the last people to see Chan before he was transferred last Tuesday. Last Wednesday she and Chan's brother, Michael, tried to visit him before the Bali Nine pair were transported to Nusakambangan 

'But as a human, I will never forget this for the rest of my life.'

It was revealed earlier this week, Chan and Feby got engaged last month following his failed bid for clemency.

Following the news of their engagemant, Feby told News Corp she was totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity.

'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' she said.

'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.' 

Chan's mother accompanied Feby along with Sukuraman's mother, sister and brother to visit the inmates.

Australia's Consul-General to Bali, Majell Hind, also made the boat trip across with the family members. 

The pair's lawyer will appear in Jakarta's State Administrative Court on their behalf on Thursday to appeal a decision made in February not to review Indonesian president Joko Widodo's decision to put them on death row.
