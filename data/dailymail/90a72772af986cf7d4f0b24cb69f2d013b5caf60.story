Angela Swann is still suffering illness now, a year after contracting illness on a dream holiday

A woman who fell seriously ill on a £13,500 trip of a lifetime to Africa is still taking medication a year later.

Just days after arriving in Zanibar, Africa, Angela Swann and Andrew Smith say they were infected with gastric illnesses, which they say ruined their longed-for break.  

The pair were confined to their rooms for three days when they suffered diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea during the week-long, all inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa in March last year. 

And today, as the pair instruct expert lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to look into their case, they have told how their holiday was ruined. 

Angela, a nurse from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: 'We just couldn't keep anything down. 'We just thought it was a 24-hour bug. 

'But as soon as we were eating we had to go back to the villa. We were just very ill and weak. 'It totally ruined the holiday of a lifetime. 

'We both came back suffering from really bad symptoms and it's left us with an illness we have never had before.' 

The holiday was part of a two-week Under The Serengeti Skies tour arranged through Kuoni, which began on March 15 last year. 

Both Angela and Andrew, a service manager for Mercedes Benz, took antibiotics which they had taken on holiday with them as a precautionary measure and, following their return to the UK, they also sought treatment. 

Angela saw a private medical specialist and also had blood tests taken and an ultrasound scan due to the severity of her illness problems. And now - nearly a year on - she says she still feels ill. 

She added: 'This was supposed to be a holiday of a lifetime which we would treasure forever, but sadly when we look back now we only think of the turmoil we've been through. 

'I was not happy about some of the food served as on occasions it was undercooked and I had to send it back.

'Also sometimes some of the food served did not appear fresh and some of the food on occasions did not appear hot enough. 

'Following falling ill, our holiday was ruined and was utterly embarrassing to say the least. 'Now, we just want answers as to why we fell ill, so that we can begin-to move on from what we've been through.' 

Nichola Blackburn, the legal expert in Irwin Mitchell's International Personal Injury Law team who is representing Angela and Andrew, said: 'We are conducting investigations into what was the cause of the illness Angela and Andrew suffered from. 

The couple's week stay at the all-inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa turned sour after the pair fell ill

'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible. 

'Sadly, their story of working and saving to afford a luxury break only for the holiday to be ruined by serious illness is an unfortunate one, and understandably such issues have left Angela and Andrew frustrated and desperate for answers regarding the illness they have suffered. 

'Kuoni have denied liability and we are seeking to establish what caused them to fall ill.' 

A Kuoni spokeswoman said: 'Kuoni take any claims surrounding the health and well-being of our customers very seriously indeed. We are aware of this case, which is currently with our legal team and continues to be under investigation so it would be inappropriate to comment further on this particular incident at this stage.'
