After almost seven years, the end in convicted killer Jodi Arias' case is in sight as the jury began deliberations on Wednesday to determine whether she will receive the death penalty for murdering her boyfriend in 2008.

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' life during his closing arguments, saying the 34-year-old was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Travis Alexander.

Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'.

Jury began deliberations on Wednesday to determine whether Jodi Arias (pictured at Maricopa County Superior Court on Feb 24) will receive the death penalty for murdering her former boyfriend, Travis Alexander, in 2008

'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. 

Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. 

Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim, according to the Associated Press. 

He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 

'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' 

Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed.

If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years

So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. 

Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. 

Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. 

Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman.

Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex.

After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'.

Arias was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Alexander in 2008. She claimed she killed him in an act of self-defense, while prosecutors claimed she murdered him in a jealous rage

But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. 

Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case.

She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live.

In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury.

The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision.

If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. 

The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. 

If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
