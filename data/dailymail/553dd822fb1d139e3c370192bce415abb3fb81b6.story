Fans walked out of a UB40 gig because the music was so loud it made their ears bleed.

Around 30 people left the performance in Cambridge after complaining about the deafening volume.

Anna Webster, 54, left before the reggae band had even finished their first song on Monday night.

She said: 'It was just horrendously loud - the bass was vibrating even in the foyer.

'There were so many people walking out because they couldn’t deal with it.

'It was vibrating through your whole body - it was actually altering heart rhythms.'

Ms Webster, from Willingham, Cambs., said the noise caused her ear at the Corn Exchange - which already had a perforated drum - to bleed.

Fellow fan Angela Paffett, 56, from Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, said deafening renditions of hits including Red, Red Wine and Can’t Help Falling in Love left her in physical pain.

She said: 'The bass crashed into you like a steam train. I had a pain in my chest.'

Stella Jackson, 52, from Arlesey, Bedfordshire, also left early and said the gig was a 'waste of money' and gave her a headache.

A UB40 spokesman said he spoke to Ms Webster and apologised to her if her evening was 'spoiled'.

He said she was happy with the offer of VIP tickets to a gig in Wolverhampton.

Birmingham's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978. The original line-up played together for about 30 years - before Ali Campbell left in January 2008, claiming management disputes

One music fan - who had already had a perforated ear drum (a hole or tear) complained of a bleeding ear due to the noise levels at the concert - this is a symptom of the condition.

This is in itself not dangerous and is nature's way of relieving pressure from the build up of pus behind the ear drum. This in turn relieves the pain of the infection and allows it to get better.

Repeated perforation should however be avoided if possible because each time the ear drum bursts it leaves a small amount of scar tissue as it heals. Scar tissue is thicker than normal tissue and makes the ear drum less flexible to noise vibration.

Repeated perforations may scar the ear drum leading to reduced hearing in that ear.

According to the World Health Organisation, the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places and loud music.

Ways to protect your eats at concerts include: wearing earplugs, standing away from speakers and taking breaks from the room where the noise is playing.

He said he believed 'the vast 
majority of people were not affected', adding that no-one had complained
 about the noise to the band’s sound engineer.

A
 Cambridge Corn Exchange spokesman said the venue always worked within 
'strict health and safety guidelines' and ear plugs were made available 
for people on the night.

He said the responsibility for the concert’s sound levels lay with promoter DHP Concerts.

Health and safety law at the venue states that the continuous sound level should not exceed 107 dB, with the peak sound pressure level not exceeding 140 dB.

Birmingham's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978 and went on to have 34 top 40 singles and release 18 albums.

The original line-up played together for about 30 years - before Ali Campbell left in January 2008, claiming management disputes.

Mickey Virtue followed suit and then Astro quit in 2013 - the trio have now reformed as UB40 Reunited.

The remaining six members continued to tour and record with Ali Campbell's brother, Duncan, on vocals - it was this group which played at the Corn Exchange on Monday night.

The split has proved to be acrimonious - in February UB40 Reunited released a statement saying: 'Anyone going to a concert by the remaining five will be treated to merely a karaoke version of how the band did indeed sound, with a replacement singer who has never recorded a previous UB40 album and is no part of the UB40 history.

'There is only one vocal sound for UB40 and only two genuine vocalists and it is us.'
