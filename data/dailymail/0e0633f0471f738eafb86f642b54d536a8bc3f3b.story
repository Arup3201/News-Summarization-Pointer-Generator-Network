A million-dollar haunted house attraction at the Perth Royal Show based on the notorious London mental health institute  has been forced into a last-minute name and theme change after a backlash from mental health groups.

The Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia has confirmed the ‘Bethlem Sanatorium’ will be renamed as ‘Mayhem Manor’ and rather than feature actors playing the mentally ill patients, it will now offer the more mundane zombie contagion.

This is despite the attraction being created over  six years.

Architect Leonard Pickel said the theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute

The Bethlem Sanatorium ride was based on one of the world’s oldest mental institutes, the Bethlem Royal Hospital, which was founded as a hospital in the 13th century, located in Beckenham of south London.

The haunted house style exhibition had initial plans to feature an open ward with 23 rooms filled with actors dressed in hospital gowns and scrubs.

But executive director of Consumers of Mental Health, Shauna Gaebler told Daily Mail Australia that it was unacceptable to host attractions that misinterpret people with mental health issues as an object of fear, humour and entertainment.

'I was horrified by the inclusion of the exhibition at the show, which  was offensive and stigmatising to people with lived experience of mental health challenges.

‘We also considered the exhibition would encourage people with mental health issues to be viewed as a tourist attraction and as an object of fun for the general public, just as they were in the 1600s.

‘We want a family fun event but not to an extent of confronting vulnerable members of the community or have people laughing at it and treating it as a joke.'

Ms Gaebler said that with an estimated 400,000 people attending the Royal Show each year, exhibitions such as the Bethlem Sanatorium had the potentials to send the wrong message to the community in regards people with mental health challenges. 

‘We are pleased that the Royal Agricultural Society has listened to our views and made changes to this attraction,' she said.

'The zombie themed horror show is a lot better than actors playing patients in hospital gowns while yelling and screaming and the outcome is a real win for people with mental health issues.'

The exhibition will no longer feature actors playing mentally ill patients but is set to provide some frightening zombies instead

The Bethlem Sanatorium architect Leonard Pickel told Daily Mail Australia that the theme had nothing to do with the modern day mental health institute.

‘It's disappointing but we’re happy to change and go a different direction because we didn’t want to push anyone away or get people upset and offended,' he said.

‘We wanted to shine the light on the sanatorium during a historical time of the horrible and the frightening condition when patients were horrendously treated and the hospital was underfunded and wasn't well managed.

'We were really gentle with the theme and it was a theatrical literature for everyone to experience an actual place in time but in a safer environment.

'It's probably the best haunted house I've made - nothing like Australia has ever seen and I'm looking forward for people to come and see.'

The Royal show spokeswoman Maryanne Shaddick told Daily Mail Australia that there were no intentions to cause offence and the exhibit was not about mental health issues.

'It's a haunted house thrill attraction with sophisticated special effects and people should see it before drawing any conclusions,’ she said.

‘It’s a family event, with a range of entertainment for all ages and we encourage everyone to attend this weekend.’
