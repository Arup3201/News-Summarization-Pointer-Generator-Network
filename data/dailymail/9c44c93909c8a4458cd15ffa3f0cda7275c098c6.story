Attacked: Rene Umberger wants her attacker charged with attempted murder

A female diver claims she was attacked Thursday while 50 feet underwater off the coast of Hawaii, and has the video to prove it.

Rene Umberger, 53, of Kona, is calling for the man who ripped the air supply out of her mouth to be charged with attempted murder after an altercation that she says almost killed her.

‘This man needs to be arrested,’ she told Hawaii News Now. ‘I think this man needs to be arrested immediately for attempted murder.’

Umberger claims she encountered her attacker – who is named in a separate article, but MailOnline is withholding his name because he has yet to be charged – while documenting damage to coral reefs just off the coast.

Video of the incident shows a diver quickly swim towards her and rip out her oxygen line. She eventually got it back in again, but then he came back for more.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

‘I honestly thought he was coming back for a second attack,’ said Umberger. ‘I got up on the boat and I said oh my God, someone just tried to kill me underwater.’

The environmental activist says she has taken more than 10,000 dives in her life, and that experience is what kept her from dying.

‘An inexperienced diver would likely panic. Either panic from the stress of the situation and shoot for the surface, she explained. ‘They may panic because their air source is missing and they can't find it.

Any of those things causes a diver to shoot for the surface and those incidents often lead to death.’

Suffocating: Her air supply was ripped out, leaving her unable to breath for almost half a minute

Umberger appears in the video to find her oxygen in under 30 seconds.

Going to the surface too quickly causes divers to die of a condition called ‘the bends,’ which results from oxygen decompressing in the body and forming bubbles in different parts of the body.

The oxygen bubbles can cause symptoms ranging from joint pain to paralysis and seizures caused by brain damage.

‘Never in a million years. Never in a million years did I think that someone would attack like that, especially from such a distance,’ Umberger lamented. ‘It's not like we were close up or in their face.’

Coming for her: The divers saw Umberger from a distance away and swam at her

Not near to them: This shot from the beginning of the video shows how far they were from the other divers, there appears to be no provocation

She believes the man, and another diver he was with, were reef fisherman skimming the area for fish to take back to land and sell for use in aquariums – which she says damages the ecosystem.

‘The greater issue is that Hawaii's reefs are being emptied by these commercial operations,’ said Umberger. ‘Hawaii's reefs are suffering incredibly from this unlimited collection.’

Reef fishing is legal in Hawaii provided the fisherman has the proper permit and adheres to seasonal, territorial and quantity rules, Hawaii News Now noted. It is not clear if the aggressor was breaking any of those rules.
