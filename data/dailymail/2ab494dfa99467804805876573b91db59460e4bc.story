Many people are subjected to their neighbours' noisy attempts at DIY. However, most of us might only have to endure it on the weekends or on Bank Holidays.

So spare a thought for the residents in this London road whose lives were made a misery for ten years while their noisy neighbour built a microlight plane and a boat - in his one-bedroom flat.

Mad mechanic David Cameron - who shares his name with the Prime Minister - transformed the block of flats he lived at in exclusive West Kensington into his own personal workshop for a decade.

Scroll down to see what Mr Cameron's neighbours experienced!...

His own personal workshop: Huge chunks of Cameron's contraptions were built in his flat then taken outside and assembled

The end of their tether: Neighbours said they had enough of him operating heavy machinery, tinkering with engines and sawing and hacking at wood on the doorstep of their apartment block

First he built his own full-sized 
microlight - fitted with a cockpit and propellers - at the property and 
then spent two years constructing his own 12ft by 10ft speed boat.

Now the housing association tenant is to be evicted from his home.

Huge chunks of Cameron’s contraptions were built in his flat then taken outside and assembled.

However
both were dismantled when neighbours complained to housing association 
chiefs - about the incessant banging, crashing, sawing and 
angle-grinding which has gone on for a decade.

Neighbours said they had reached the 
end of their tether with him operating heavy machinery, tinkering with 
engines and sawing and hacking at wood on the doorstep of their 
apartment block.

On one occasion Cameron was caught single-handedly lowering a 12ft metal girder from his bedroom window on a piece of old rope.

On
another occasion he was filmed with sparks flying on to the street as 
he recklessly operated an angle grinder on his front garden wall.

Housing bosses confirmed they had lost patience with Cameron and were giving him the boot.

Constant and incessant noise... but Cameron's contraptions were dismantled when neighbours complained to housing association chiefs

The pensioner is being evicted after 
he was finally ruled to have breached his tenancy agreement and ignored 
an injunction he was served with last year.

Stephen Meinhold, 55, a father of two, who lives below Cameron said his life had been made a 'living hell'.

The former computer engineer said: 'There is constant crashing, sawing and chopping, which goes on for hours.

'It started when I moved in and he built a plane. He then spent years repairing bike engines in his little one bedroom flat.

'Then about two years ago he started building a boat. I have asked him to stop dozens of times but he just threatens me.

'He caused flooding on Christmas morning and even lowered a massive steel girder from his bedroom window entirely on his own.

'It's amazing he can do all this in his flat but he has caused havoc for the rest of us.

Causing havoc: Cameron's work left neighbours so distressed that housing officers are now in the process of evicting him

'I have been trying to get him stop and he has been taken to court but he just doesn’t listen. All I have ever wanted is peace and he has not allowed me to have that.'

In September last year Genesis sought a court injunction preventing Cameron from undertaking large building work in his second floor flat, which is in a converted town house with three other apartments.

But at the start on February 10 housing officers were forced to visit Cameron after receiving more complaints from distressed neighbours.

He failed to comply with a final warning and a notice to possess his property was sent last week.

A spokesman for housing association Genesis, said: 'Following repeated complaints about Mr Cameron we sought a court injunction to prevent further work from taking place.

'As the resident has consistently ignored the previous warnings and the injunction, Genesis has been left with no other alternative but to seek possession of the property.

'In terms of how Mr Cameron was building the plane and boat, he was constructing various bits in his flat. He claimed that the full thing was then being constructed away from his flat.'
