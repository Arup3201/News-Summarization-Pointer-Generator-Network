Andy Murray is to marry his fiancee Kim Sears at the luxury hotel he owns in Scotland.

The couple are understood to be arranging the private service for April 11 at the five-star Cromlix House Hotel, close to his home town of Dunblane.

The former Wimbledon champion bought the venue in 2013, which has its own chapel, for £1.8million and it opened last year after a refurbishment.

The hotel where they will tie the knot was named Scottish hotel of the year in 2014 - just weeks after it opened its doors to guests.

The tennis star bought Cromlix, three miles (4.8km) from Dunblane in central Scotland, in 2013.

The Victorian mansion was extensively refurbished, featuring 10 bedrooms and five suites which overlook manicured grounds and tennis courts.
