Thomas Eric Duncan's temperature spiked to 103F during the hours of his initial visit to an emergency room - a fever that was flagged with an exclamation point in the hospital's record-keeping system, according to his newly-released medical records today.

Despite telling a nurse that he had recently been in Africa and displaying other symptoms that could indicate Ebola, the man who would become the only person to die from the disease in the U.S. underwent a battery of tests and was eventually sent home.

Duncan's family provided his medical records today, more than 1,400 pages in all. They encompass his time in the ER, his urgent return to the hospital two days later and chronicle his steep decline as his organs began to fail.

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, is the first person to die from the recent Ebola outbreak on U.S. soil. He passed away on Wednesday morning at a Dallas hospital

Duncan carried the deadly virus with him from his home in Liberia, though he showed no symptoms when he left for the United States. He arrived in Dallas on September 20 and fell ill several days later.

When he first showed up at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the man complained of abdominal pain, dizziness, a headache and decreased urination.

He reported severe pain - rating it an eight on a scale of 10. Doctors gave him CT scans to rule out appendicitis, stroke and numerous other serious ailments. 

Ultimately, he was prescribed antibiotics and told to take Tylenol, then returned to the apartment where he was staying with his partner, Louise Troh, her son and two adult nephews.

In spite of his fever, a physician's note dated September 26, said Duncan was 'negative for fever and chills'.

'I have given patient instructions regarding their diagnosis, expectations for the next couple of days, and specific return precautions,' according to the emergency room physician's note. 

'The condition of the patient at this time is stable.'

After his condition worsened, someone in the apartment called 911, and paramedics took him back to the hospital on September 28. That's when he was admitted and swiftly put in isolation. 

Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said the care his uncle received was 'either incompetence or negligence'.

Either way 'there is a problem, and we need to find the answer to it,' he said, adding that it was 'conspicuous' that all the white Ebola patients in the U.S. survived 'and the one black man died'.

The medical records, released today, contain some 1400 pages in all of the Ebola patient's care from his first visit to hospital to his more critical care

The documents also show that a nurse recorded early in Duncan's first hospital visit that he recently came to the U.S. from Africa, though he denied having been in contact with anyone sick.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had alerted hospitals nationwide to take a travel history for patients with Ebola-like symptoms. 

According to the records, Duncan was 45. Relatives said he was 42. The discrepancy could not be immediately resolved. 

In a statement issued Friday, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said it had made procedural changes and continues to 'review and evaluate' the decisions surrounding Duncan's care. 

Doctors who evaluated Duncan did not respond to messages left at their offices. 

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who reviewed some of the records, said Duncan's travel history was listed in a nursing notice but not in the physician's note.

The patient's 103-degree fever might warrant 'a little more investigation,' Adalja said. 

A chart showed he did not arrive with a fever but left with one.

By Duncan's second ER visit, the care was 'impeccable,' the doctor said. Dallas physicians immediately signaled concern about Ebola and 'spared no measure to try to keep him alive'.

The hospital has repeatedly changed its account of what the medical team knew when it released Duncan from the emergency room early on September 26.

A few days later, on September 30, it initially said Duncan did not tell the staff he had been in Africa. 

On October 1, it said Duncan's nurse had been aware of the Africa connection but did not share that information with the rest of the medical team.

The next day, the hospital blamed a flaw in its electronic health-records systems for not making Duncan's travel history directly accessible to his doctor.

A day later, on October 3, the hospital issued a statement saying Duncan's travel history had been available to all hospital workers, including doctors, who treated him during his initial visit.

On Thursday, Texas Health strenuously defended Mr Duncan's treatment and said he was given the highest level of care 'regardless of nationality or ability to pay'.

The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas was responding to claims from the 42-year-old Liberian's family that he was given substandard treatment because he was 'a poor black man'.

The hospital said Mr Duncan had been cared for by a team of over 50 doctors and nurses, 24 hours a day.

The hospital said Mr Duncan was not given the experimental drug ZMapp because the manufacturer has no more stocks and that he was not given a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor because he was a different blood group.

Dr Kent Brantly, the first American flown back to the U.S. for treatment of Ebola, confirmed that account, saying he spoke with a doctor caring for Duncan and was willing to donate blood. 

But their blood types were incompatible, he said on Friday in an interview with Abilene Christian University's alumni magazine where he was giving a speech on surviving the Ebola virus.

Details of his care were released as Duncan's nephew launched a renewed attack on the Dallas hospital, claiming his uncle had received inferior treatment.

Josephus Weeks told MSNBC: 'He is a poor black man. He had a very deep accent coming from West Africa. 

'I believe they [the hospital authorities] didn't believe he deserved the care that everyone else should get. And you don't treat people like that.' 

The hospital also claimed Mr Duncan was appropriately dealt with when he first presented to the hospital feeling unwell with Ebola-like symptoms - and was sent home with antibiotics - two days before he was rushed to hospital and given the correct diagnosis.

It said: 'In addition, we'd like to correct some misconceptions that have been reported about Mr. Duncan's first visit. Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care.

'In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.' 

Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three have recovered. Virus victims Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol were treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Dr Rick Sacra and NBC camera Ashoka Mukpo received transfusions of Dr Brantley's blood.

Ashoka Mukpo, is being treated at the University of Nebraska's Medical Centre and a World Health Organization doctor is being treated in Atlanta, Georgia.
