Tragic: Jesse Quincey, 15, has died after falling from a train station platform on to a 750-volt live rail while 'drunk on vodka'

A teenage boy has died after falling from a train station platform on to a 750-volt live rail while 'drunk on vodka'.

Jesse Quincey, 15, was electrocuted when he stumbled on to the power line at Horley railway station in Surrey yesterday.

Despite emergency crews arriving at the scene within minutes, he was pronounced dead at around 8.40pm.

Jesse, from Redhill, Surrey, has been named locally, but is yet to be formally identified by police.

Today, his distraught friends said he had been drunk on vodka when he fell on to the station's 'third rail', which is situated between the rails of the track and provides power to trains.

Trent Reed, 16, said Jesse had been standing on the platform with another friend called Morgan when the accident happened.

'He was here with us last night. It was just a usual night 
and we were chatting and stuff,' he said.

'Jesse
 turned up drunk. He was drinking vodka but that was what he was like. 
He had had a hard life so I think he drank to block out the pain.

'He seemed quite drunk so Morgan walked him to the station so he could catch the train home.

'The
 next thing we heard was he had fallen on the tracks and was dead. I 
just can't get my head around it. He was with us one minute and gone the
 next.'

Mr Reed said Jesse had been taken into care after his father was sent to prison and his mother became seriously ill - adding: 'But you never saw him without a smile on his face.'

Police were called to Horley railway station yesterday after Jesse fell from the platform edge, while a train which had just passed through the station juddered to a halt.

British Transport Police and Surrey Police officers and paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes, but were unable to do anything to save the teenager.

Today, investigators were examining CCTV footage and speaking to witnesses at the railway station.

One woman, whose son was friends with Jesse, said the news of the teenager's death was 'absolutely heartbreaking'.

'He was in my house last night and he was the same old Jesse,' she said. 'He had an outstanding personality and he was always there for his friends to talk to.

'He was always laughing. Despite everything he had been through in his life, I have never seen that boy sad.'

A British Transport Police (BTP) spokesman said: 'Officers from BTP and Surrey Police attended Horley railway station on Monday after a report of a body on the tracks.

'The incident was reported to BTP at 8.41pm and was also attended by Surrey Fire Service and South East Coast Service.

'On arrival, officers discovered the body of a male who is believed to have been electrocuted after falling from the platform and coming into contact with the live power rail.

'He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The spokesman added: 'At this stage, officers believe there are no suspicious circumstances and the incident appears to have been the result of a tragic accident.'

An inquest is expected to take place in due course.
