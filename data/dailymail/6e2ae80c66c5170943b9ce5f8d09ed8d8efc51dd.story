Michel Platini has backed Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's plan to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12.

Dyke is facing opposition to his plans from the Premier League but UEFA president Platini said the European body would work to help him.

It comes as Dyke said it was 'depressing' to read Rio Ferdinand's newspaper column claiming that managers such as Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho may not be giving young English players a chance.

UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players

The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12

While there is a slight increase in the number of English players in the Premier League this year — up from 32% last year to 35% — that is largely down to Burnley being promoted. If they were to be relegated and replaced by Watford — second in the Championship — the proportion would fall to 31%.

However, only 22% of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for England, compared to 28% last year.

In 2014, just 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage, compared with 78 Spaniards, 55 Germans and 51 Brazilians.

This season the three English clubs that reached the knockout stages of the Champions League started only 10 English players, compared to 12 French and nine Spanish in those three sides.

In the last two weeks only five English players started in the second legs of the knockout stage.

In 2010 England Under 17s won the European Championship, beating Spain in the final. Of that 18-man match-day squad, only four have gone on to play more than 20 top-flight games, while double that from the Spanish squad have done so in La Liga.

Of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five Premier League seasons, the average number of home-grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4. Only 62% of current home-grown players are qualified to play for England.

Platini, speaking after the UEFA Congress in Vienna, said: 'This is a position we defend. We're not only talking about England, we're talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke's struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him.

'With the new leader of the European Commission it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect home-grown, grass-roots young players in the different countries. We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one.

'There is free flow of workers but there are some things that doesn't work well and we need to address it.'

UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino admitted that its similar rule of eight home-grown players in European squads was not working as well as it should and called Dyke's initiative 'fantastic'.

He added: 'We are at eight out of 25 and we see it is not really as great as it should be so whatever move in favour of increasing home-grown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.'

Dyke's proposals are set to be discussed at a Premier League chairmen's meeting on Thursday as well as the FA board. They also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21.

The FA chairman said: 'I thought Rio Ferdinand's column was in some ways quite depressing. It virtually said Mourinho is virtually saying he is not going to play the kids anyway. Why have an academy then?

'It's not fair on the kids. It was always tough for kids to get through but it seems unfair now.'

Asked if he had looked at how the FA could force the new rules through despite opposition, he replied: 'We have but that's not the way we want to go. We have looked at it yes.'

Dyke said all the proposals were open for discussion.

He added: 'I think it's more about the clubs than the leadership if you want my honest opinion. It's the unfairness of a system that is massively improved because of the EPPP (Elite Player Performance Plan) which was introduced by the Premier League led by Richard Scudamore, he has done a great job.

'The trouble is that it is only any good if the kids get through the system - if they can't get through the system why bother?

'We are open to discussions on all of it. This is a set of ideas which we think will work.'
