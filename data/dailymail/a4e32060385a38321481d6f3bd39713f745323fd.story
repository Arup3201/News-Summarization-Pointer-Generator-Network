Police rescued two small boys from a squalid house after finding it filled with garbage, rotting food and a septic system had backed up into the bathtub, the toilet and the sink.

Officers in Lilburn, Georgia, arrested the children's mother, Sky Mitsch, along with the father of one of the children, Stephen Hunt, both 22, on child cruelty charges. Both children are now in state custody.

The boys, an infant and a 2-year-old, had no food in the house and there was no running water, authorities said. The toddler was covered in flea bites and his ears were impacted with wax. 

Conditions were so deplorable, police called animal control officers to remove the dog from the house because they feared for its safety.

Squalor: The owner of this house called police when he saw the horrible mess that his tenants were keeping their two children in

Fetid water: The septic tank was full and had been backing up into the sink and shower drains in the home

'They determined it was not even fit for the dog,' Lilburn Police Capt Ben Haynes told Mail Online.

The owner of the house, Charles Reagin, was renting it to Mitsch and called police when he saw the deplorable conditions inside.

Outside, the front yard was littered with garbage, broken beer bottles and diapers full of excrement.

The back yard was a dump, filled with trash.

Inside conditions were dramatically worse, Capt Haynes said. 

The water to the house has been shut off and the septic tank was overflowing. This caused sewage and waste waster to back up in the sinks, the toilet and the bathtub.

The toilet could not flush, but the family seemed to be using it anyway.

The bathtub, once pearly white, was ringed with black sludge.

Mess: Police said the deplorable conditions inside the home were not even fit for animals, much less an infant and a toddler

In the kitchen sink, dishes soaked in fetid water with food scraps.

The refrigerator was filthy and nearly empty -- brown sludge coated the bottom.

The floor was so messy, it may as well have been dirt, the Capt Haynes said.

Food sat out, rotting. Garbage, dirty clothes and diapers littered the rooms.

Live ammunition and prescription drugs were discovered within reach of the children.

When they found the two-year-old boy, his face was covered with flea bites.

He was so badly in need of care that earwax was coming out his ears.

'It's very difficult to understand how you would let something like this get to this degree,' Haynes said.

Mitsch and Hunt seemed largely un-phased by the horrifying squalor, Haynes said.

They told officers they knew the house was 'just a little dirty' and that they were in the process of cleaning up.

The pair were arrested on the spot. The Department of Human Services took the toddler into custody and went to the grandmother's house to seize the infant, who was just seven months old.

As officers left the house, one discovered a remnant of the horrid scene had stayed with him -- he found a flea crawling on his skin. 

Investigators are still trying to determine how and why the parents allowed their house to sink to such deplorable conditions, Haynes said.

Officers found drug paraphernalia, but addiction to hard drugs does not appear to be the driving factor in the case, he said.

'I never let my kids live in something like this, never,' Reagin, the landlord, told WSBTV.

Mitsch and her family members told the TV station that they were planning to move out of the house, anyway and are working to get her children back.
