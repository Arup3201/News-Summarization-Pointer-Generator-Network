Ministers are considering allowing heterosexual couples to enter civil partnerships

Ministers are considering allowing heterosexual couples to enter civil partnerships as part of a desperate attempt to avoid defeat on their gay marriage Bill.

In yet another U-turn to placate restive Tory backbenchers, the Government has promised a review into the future of civil partnerships five years after same-sex marriage becomes law.

It will look at whether the partnerships should be scrapped – or whether they should also be offered to a man and woman as an alternative to marriage.

The government has previously refused to 
countenance such a move, saying it would undermine the ‘gold standard’ 
status of marriage.

But Tory rebels – estimated at up to 150 – said the change did not go far enough.

They said they would still vote on Monday for the immediate extension of civil partnerships to heterosexual couples – which they said was vital if marriage was to be extended to same-sex couples.

Rebel leader Tim Loughton, a former children's minister, said he was confident of victory.

‘This amendment will not wash,’ he said. ‘If this Bill passes through Parliament as it stands, both marriage and civil partnerships will be available to same-sex couples, but opposite-sex couples would only have access to marriage.

‘This cannot be fair to the many couples in loving, stable relationships who for whatever reasons do not wish to go down the traditional marriage route, but who do want a public recognition of their commitment and protections under the law that civil partnerships rightly brought to gay couples.’

The new government amendment promising the review was tabled yesterday.

Culture minister Maria Miller, who is in charge of equalities issues, said: ‘The Equal Marriage Bill is about extending marriage to same-sex couples. Questions have been raised about whether we should also extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples.

‘There are strong views on both sides of
this debate, and we have listened to those views. We are therefore 
offering the House the opportunity to have a review of this area, rather
than legislating now without the required evidence.’

Only three days ago, Mrs Miller ruled out extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples completely, saying it was neither a ‘necessity or a requirement’.

She told the parliamentary joint committee on human rights: ‘We don’t feel there is either a necessity or a requirement to open up civil partnerships to heterosexual couples because there is no deficit there - there is no lack of an ability to be able to formalise a relationship in a legal way.

'It is already there for heterosexual couples. It’s called marriage.’

Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who has campaigned for civil partnerships to be extended to heterosexual couples, said he was disappointed the move will not be implemented immediately and will only be considered as part of a review.

‘While the government’s promise of a review of civil partnership law is welcome, it is unnecessary,’ he said.

‘A majority of the public support the retention of civil partnerships and want to make them available to heterosexual couples, according to the government’s own public consultation last year.

‘David Cameron and Maria Miller should stop delaying and making excuses. They say their support for gay marriage is based on a commitment to equality, yet they are refusing to support equal civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. They’re not being consistent.’

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘Civil partnerships were created for a very specific reason - to give same-sex couples access to legal rights at a time when society was not ready to give them access to marriage.

‘Now that the time is right to extend marriage to same sex couples, it is also right that we should consider the future of civil partnerships.

‘There are strong views on both sides of this debate, and we have listened to those views. A proper review will allow us to look at the issues in a considered and thorough way, giving full consideration to the implications of any changes.’
