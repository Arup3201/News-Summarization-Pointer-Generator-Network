Tragedy: Father-of-six Ceri Griffiths, 71, died when a tree he was felling crushed him, an inquest heard

A wildlife park boss was killed in front of his son after he was crushed by a tree he was felling for fuel, an inquest heard today.

Father-of-six Ceri Griffiths, 71, could not escape as the tree crashed down onto his head at his South Wales bird centre.

Mr Griffiths suffered catastrophic brain injuries from the accident at his Welsh Hawking Centre in Barry, near Cardiff, and died later in hospital.

He cut into a v-shaped trunk believing it was one tree - not two - and the second tree fell on him.

Falconry expert Mr Griffiths and son Griff were cutting down trees with a chainsaw to use as fuel for his wood burner.

His son  told the Cardiff inquest: 'He had cut a v-shape in the tree four feet from the ground when I saw that the tree was two trees which had merged into one trunk.

'My dad cut through the trunk not knowing this and as it was it was falling it caused a split and the whole thing came crashing down.

'My dad could not get out of the way and it fell onto his head.'

Paramedics treated Mr Griffiths at the scene before he was taken to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales in October where he died hours later.

Former teacher Mr Griffiths bought a former zoo in Barry to turn it into one of Britain's leading falconry centres.

He gave lessons, provided hawks and owls for films and TV and became a pioneer of breeding birds of prey in captivity.

Arab sheiks visited his centre and he had recently been working on a falconry project in Dubai.

Cardiff assistant coroner Christopher Woolley told the inquest: 'Mr Griffiths was very experienced in cutting down trees. But unknown to him two trees had merged.

'It made the cutting down more complicated than he had anticipated. It split 20 feet high and came down unpredictably. He died from catastrophic brain injuries.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
