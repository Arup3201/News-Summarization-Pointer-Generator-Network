A lawyer for the Leveson Inquiry who had an affair with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press was paid more than £200,000 by taxpayers.

Carine Patry Hoskins charged fees of £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work on the counsel team used by Lord Justice Leveson for his investigation into  media standards.

Rob Wilson, the Conservative  MP who uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions, said it was ‘one hell of a pay day’ given the judge’s claim that Miss Patry Hoskins had no influence over his findings.

Pay: Leveson barrister Carine Patry Hoskins received almost £220,000 in fees, it emerged

Mr Wilson has led calls for an inquiry
into whether the relationship between the married mother-of-two and 
David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press 
regulation, could have compromised its findings.

A code of conduct suggests that 
affairs between opposing lawyers risk creating the perception of ‘a 
danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’.

Mr Sherborne, who represented Hugh 
Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to 
the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last 
year – while the inquiry was being conducted.

The pair claim they simply discussed 
the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. They 
say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry
had ended in December.

Affair: She reportedly began a relationship with David Sherborne, a lawyer who acted for several celebrities during the inquiry including actor Hugh Grant

Lord Justice Leveson has rejected any 
suggestion that his report into press standards may have been tainted by
the relationship and insisted ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion 
and every recommendation’ in last year’s report was his alone.

Mr Wilson, parliamentary aide to 
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, says he will write again to Lord Justice 
Leveson to request a full breakdown of the work done by Miss Patry 
Hoskins.

‘This is one hell of a pay day for 
someone described by Lord Justice Leveson as doing merely mechanical and
fact-checking work,’ the MP said.

‘It raises questions as to whether 
this is value for taxpayers’ money as to why she was paid over ten times
the average wage only to have no influence or input whatsoever into the
Leveson Report.

‘Surely someone more junior could have
undertaken these junior tasks – at a fraction of the cost? This is 
either an extravagant use of taxpayers’ money, or we do not yet know the
full extent of her work.

‘I will be writing to Lord Justice 
Leveson to request a full breakdown of what Carine Patry Hoskins was 
paid for in the light of the huge sums of taxpayers’ money involved.’

Appointment: Barrister Robert Jay QC, who became the face of the Leveson Inquiry griling witnesses for months, was today made a High court Judge where he was pictured with wife Deborah

Miss Patry Hoskins became known as 
‘woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for 
her close attention to Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry, which
cost £5.44million. Counsel’s fees hit £1.44million, with a further 
£315,600 spent on barristers providing assistance to counsel.

Lord Justice Leveson has said it was 
for the Bar Standards Board, not him, to determine whether there has 
been any breach of the professional code of conduct. He also said he 
would not be ‘engaging in further public debate about the work of the 
inquiry or the integrity of its processes’.

In his report, he thanked the inquiry 
counsel, who included Miss Patry Hoskins, for ‘collating and presenting 
such a massive volume of evidence so efficiently’.

He said that as second junior counsel 
to his inquiry, Miss Patry Hoskins ‘undertook all of her work at the 
request and under the direction of either myself or Robert Jay QC’.
