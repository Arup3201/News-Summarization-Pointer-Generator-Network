Barcelona are set to sign Valencia defender Jeremy Mathieu as Luis Enrique's overhaul of the Catalan club continues.

Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and goalkeepers Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Claudio Bravo have already arrived at the club this summer and now Enrique has turned his attention to strengthening the club's defence following the retirement of Carles Puyol.

Javier Mascherano has previously played that role but it is believed Enrique has earmarked him for a spot in midfield after his performances in that position for Argentina at the 2014 World Cup helped them reach the final.

Dream move: The 30-year-old will sign a four-year deal with the Catalan giants

Strength in depth: The French defender will compete with Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra

Barca have been at deadlock with Valencia over the signing of the French defender, but are believed to have reached a compromise lower than the â‚¬20 million release clause in Mathieu's contract after he pleaded with his employers to sanction the move.

Mathieu is quoted by Superdeporte as saying: 'My transfer to Barcelona could be announced this afternoon? I'm hopeful.'

The 30-year-old could even be confirmed as a Barcelona player on Tuesday.

His arrival continues a summer of change at the club which has seen goalkeepers Victor Valdes and Jose Manuel Pinto depart as well as former club captain Puyol retire, while Xavi has been linked with a move away. Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez were also allowed to join Chelsea and Arsenal respectively.

Mathieu is likely to compete alongside Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra for a place in the heart of Barcelona's defence.
