With the deafening noise of commercial planes overhead, peeling paint, chipped tiles and a patchy backyard complete with an over-sized antenna, one might ask who would want to live in the run-down home.

But the three bedroom home in Mascot in Sydney's south-east, has proven to be just another one of the citys dumps that home-buyers are willing to spend millions on.

Only a three minute drive from Sydney's busy and bustling airport, the house is expected to be auctioned off for at least $1,089,000 when it goes under the hammer.

A three bedroom home on Middlemiss Street in Sydney's south-east is expected to be sold for at least $1,089,000 despite its poor condition

N G Farah real-estate agent Joe Recep told the Daily Mail Australia that 'it would be a lot easier just to bulldoze it and start again'

Since being advertised online only three days ago, N G Farah real-estate agent Joe Recep said the property has received well over 40 inquiries.

'The demographic [of people inquiring] is very wide. There are people looking to invest, people looking to upgrade from units or smaller dwellings who live in the area and developers looking to bulldoze it and put two dwellings in its place,' Mr Recep told the Daily Mail Australia.

'It's all about the location and the price point; you can't get much for under a million in this area.'

Mr Recep said that the location of the house, rather than being a detriment in terms of noise, was more likely to attract buyers due to its 'convenient' proximity to the airport, benefiting anyone who works there.

Since being put on the market only three days ago, the property has already received at least 40 email inquiries from people showing interest

Built in the 60s, the property is set on a 390 square metre plot of land but the house only takes up about 40 per cent of the available space.

'It's in pretty poor condition. It's pretty much in its original state and it would be a lot easier just to bulldoze it and start again,' Mr Recep said.

The agent said that the current owner is a young man who bough the house as an investment property and is now planning to put the sale money into his business.

Mr Recep acknowledge the growing trend of home-buyers who take on run-down properties 'as their project', a movement which has been pushed along by 'Sydney's hot property price market'.

'They may seem expensive but they're often really good value. A lot of people like to be their own home renovators and build their dream home to their own taste,' Mr Recep said.

Inquiries have come from people looking to invest, people looking to upgrade from smaller dwellings who live in the area and developers looking to bulldoze it and put two dwellings in its place
