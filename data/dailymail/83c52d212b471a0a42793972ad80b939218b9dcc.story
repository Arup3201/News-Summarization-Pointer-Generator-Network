She has taken the challenge of overcoming her phobia one step at a time.

And finally Louise Wilson feels she has beaten her life-long phobia of stairs.

The 43-year-old is so scared of going up and down steps has had to turn down countless jobs in offices without lifts due teachers would have to meet her on the ground floor at her son’s parents’ evenings.

And the fear - bathmophobia, as it is known - she has had since she was five meant she could only go up to the first floor of her home by clinging to the wall.

Daunting: Louise is finally learning to face her fears of stairs after sessions with a hypnotherapist

In one of her most trying episodes she had to go down a flight of stairs on her bottom after an escalator broke down in the shop she was visiting.

She said: 'I remember going into Marks and Spencer in my 20s, and just about being able to get upstairs on an escalator.

'But to my horror, I realised there was 
only a huge flight of stairs to go down. I completely panicked, and to 
my shame, had to sit on the steps on slide down one by one while 
clinging onto the rail.

'I think people thought I was drunk, or mad, but to me the embarrassment was nothing compared to my fear.'

The phobia progressed as she got older to the stage where she could no longer cope with slatted and open-sided stairs.

Finally, the mother-of-one sought help after her son became interested in castles and she was to frightened to go and visit them with him.

Louise said: 'I truly don't remember a time when I wasn't scared of stairs and heights; it's just always been there.

'I would get panicky and full of 
adrenaline - I didn't know what it's like to not be frightened. It was a
true phobia - I would just freeze when faced with stairs, specially 
open-slatted and open sided staircases.

'I'd feel dizzy and sick, and just want to grip the floor or the walls.'

Bathmophobia is triggered when a sufferer sees a steep slope or steps.

In that way it differs from climacophobia, which results when sufferers are expected to actually climb or descend them.

Children and adults can suffer from bathmophobia - and it is fairly common household pets.

Bathmophobia, as with other clinical fears, is generally not diagnosed in children unless it persists for more than six months.

It can be caused by a wide range of factors, but experts say a particularly common cause is an early negative experience with stairs or a steep hill, such as a trip or a fall.

The mother from Coventry sought help by visiting hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings in September.

Mr Hemmings said: 'When I met Louise, she came to me believing she had
a fear of heights.

'But after a few sessions, we realised that her real fear was stairs - especially open slatted ones.

'A couple of weeks into the treatment, 
we discovered a suppressed memory Louise had of falling off the top of a
slide when she was a young child.

'Her parents told her the incident had happened, and we believe that is where her fear stems from.'

Mr Hemmings used a combination of hypnotherapy and Neuro Linguistic Programming to tackle her phobia.

He said: 'Unless you had seen
how genuinely frightened Louise was when she came to me, it's difficult
to appreciate how well she has done.

'She has worked really hard, and we've visited "scary" stairs together.

'It just goes to show that however long you have been suffering with phobias for, it's never too late to get help.

Louise added: 'Before,
I couldn't go to my son's school to see his work in the classroom 
because it was upstairs. Even on parents' evening, the teachers had to 
come downstairs to meet me.

'It was mortifying, but there was nothing I could do to get rid of this completely irrational fear.

'I finally feel as though I can begin to live my life properly now.

'It's so nice to know that I am able to go out with my family and not have to fret about where we're going and how I'll be able to avoid the stairs.

'I still don't feel 100 per cent comfortable around them, but I know it's a fear I can control now - and in time, I hope I won't be bothered by them at all.'

Mrs wilson, who walked up stairs for the first time since she was a child three weeks ago, said: 'There’s so much I’d like to do now, like go to college. That was something I couldn’t have done before - it’s certainly opened up my options.

'I couldn’t have done it on my own, that’s for sure.'
