A teenager who weighed 414lbs has revealed how she lost half of her body weight through diet and exercise alone.

Kaitlyn Smith, 19, from Portland, Oregon, shared on her website that she previously considered gastric bypass surgery, but eventually shed 208lbs with the guidance of a local health coach.

Now, as part of her physical transformation, Kaitlyn plans to undergo a series of surgeries to remove the excess skin on her body.

Body transformation: Kaitlyn will undergo $50,000 worth of plastic surgery to remove the skin that hangs from her arms, legs, stomach and back

Kaitlyn had started raising money on GoFundMe for the surgeries, which are estimated to cost $50,000.

'There is only one thing holding me back… the excess skin,' she wrote on the page.

She explained that although her doctor found the skin-removal procedures 'medically necessary' because the excess flesh caused infections, back pain and pinching, her insurance provider deemed it 'cosmetic' and refused to cover the cost.

'Since I am still so young, I just want to feel beautiful in my own skin,' Kaitlyn added. 'I've come so far and proven to myself and others that it can be done.'

But on hearing her story, Miami-based plastic surgeon Dr Michael Salzhauer offered to perform the procedures for free

The teen, who has raised over $7,000 in six months, will now use the money to pay for her travel expenses in Miami, where she will have to fly to and stay for two weeks after each of her three surgeries. Her first procedure with Dr Salzhauer is scheduled for February 19.  

Only a few years ago, Kaitlyn dreaded going out in public because of her size and often hid in her house. After battling obesity for most of her life, she began preparing to undergo gastric bypass surgery in 2012.

'The doctor was rude, and basically told me I would never look normal,' she told The Portland Leader of starting the process. 'I left crying and my parents left furious. I was really down, and scared about it all.'

Kaitlyn's mother Kim Smith eventually contacted Portland health coach and trainer Kina Wald.

'Honestly, I was scared at first,' Kaitlyn recalled. 'I thought she was going to be like a drill sergeant yelling at me. I had tried so many different things - so many different diets. I thought there was no point.'

Nutrition guide: Kaitlyn would often skip meals because she was embarrassed to eat in front of others (left). She now eats every two hours to sustain her new figure (right)

She noted that her parents feared she was going to die after a doctor said that he didn't think she would live to be 25 years old. 

Kaitlyn said Ms Wald listened to her concerns, but reminded the teen that she would have to be the one doing all the work.

It was through Ms Wald that Kaitlyn learned she was eating too little. Her coach advised her to eat every two hours. She also taught Kaitlin how to monitor her nutrition and moderate certain exercises so she could complete workouts that were once too difficult.

'I was in size 32 pants. I didn't feel normal,' Kaitlyn said. 'I did not eat enough to be that way. For the first three to four months, I sent her what I was having for every meal. If I wasn't doing something right, she would tell me.'

When she hit 326lbs, the teen ran and completed her first 5K race.

Kaitlyn, who said Ms Wald helped her get her life back, noted that her journey has been about more than just appearance.   

'It has changed me emotionally and spiritually,' she said. 'I had to learn to love myself again, and I'm more confident now.'

Kaitlyn told The Tennessean that she had struggled with obesity at an early age.  

Although she had always been heavier than her five siblings, she began rapidly gaining weight when she was four years old. When she was eight years old, she realized that she couldn't keep up with the other kids her age.

Breaking point: Before losing the weight, Kaitlyn (left) said she stopped going out to eat with friends because she could no longer fit in the restaurant booth. Now she is no longer ashamed to be seen in public (right)

Kaitlyn's parents sought the help of a nutritionist, but their daughter continued to gain an average of 3lbs a week.

'We tried to monitor her, but she just kept gaining weight,' Mrs Smith told the outlet. 'The pediatrician couldn't understand why. Her thyroid gland and bloods tests came normal.'

Kaitlyn eventually stopped eating breakfast and lunch because she was worried that others would watch and make fun of her. She tried to avoid overindulging in home-cooked Southern dinners, but by middle school she had weighed 200lbs.

Kaitlyn said she hated going to gym class, and would get changed in the bathroom stalls. Her peers started to make fun of her 'pigeon walk'. She explained that she even started to make fun of herself as a coping mechanism. 

At 13, she could no longer fit in a single seat on a roller coaster. She stopped going out to eat with friends because was unable to squeeze into restaurant booths. Her weight made walking difficult, and she could only fit into one pair of jeans during her freshman year of high school. 

Kaitlyn soon started being home-schooled along with her younger sister Kristen, who suffers from migraines.

At her heaviest, she was wearing size 32 pants and 4XL shirts.   

'I dreaded going in public because I was afraid someone would see me,' she recalled. 'I started avoiding mirrors, and if I saw myself, I told myself how disgusting I was.' 

After losing half of her body weight and learning to love herself again, she said that she is determined to help others to do the same. 

'People told me I was the reason they're in the gym,' she said. 'People call me a hero, inspiration and superwoman. That pushes me even more.'
