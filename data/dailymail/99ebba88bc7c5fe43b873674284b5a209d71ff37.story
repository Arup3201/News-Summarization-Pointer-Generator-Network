They may be the most feared group of investigators in the world, but FBI agents still need a hand understanding internet slang like LOL and BRB, it has been revealed.

Agents who find themselves baffled by abbreviations on message boards or social media have an extensive guide to turn to, which has been released to the public under Freedom of Information laws.

The document - which is 83 pages long - includes 2,800 translations, from everyday terms such as LOL ('laughing out loud') and BRB ('be right back').

Slang: The lengthy guide can teach agents abbreviations such as L8R and BRB

Any crack investigators left scratching their heads at 2DAY or L8R also have them helpfully parsed to 'today' and 'later', according to the document published by Muckrock.

But as well as the commonplace and the obvious, it also features lengthier and more exotic examples like PMYMHMMFSWGAD ('Pardon me, you must have mistaken me for someone who gives a damn') or EOTWAWKI ('end of the world as we know it').

Some seem particular appropriate to agents working in counter-intelligences, who may not be surprised to find their targets writing phrases like SIW ('someone is watching') and IKWYL ('I know where you live').

One particularly relevant - and worrying - entry is IITYWIMIWHTKY ('If I tell you what it means I will have to kill you').

A few British-themed acronyms also made the cut, with an entry explaining GSTQ ('God save the Queen') and another making sense of NFN ('normal for Norfolk').

The FBI defines the latter phrase as: 'A derogatory term used by medical doctors in Norfolk and Norwich hospital in UK for intellectually challenged patients. Now may also mean something more endearing – like quaint.'

Although it is an official Government document, produced by researchers from within the FBI, the authors remembered to keep a light tone.

The foreword to the piece reads: 'The list has about 2,800 entries you should find useful in your work - or for keeping up with your children and/or grandchildren.'

BFFLTDDUP – Best friends for life till death do us part

BMGWL – Busting my gut with laughter

ICBINB – I can’t believe it’s not butter

IGP – I gotta pee

IITYWIMIWHTKY – If I tell you what it means I will have to kill you

IOKIYAR – It’s OK if you’re a Republican

KTBSPA – Keep the backstreet pride alive

NIFOC – Naked in front of computer

WTFT - What the French toast?
