A bonfire society has been criticised for burning a 'distasteful and disrespectful effigy' of Remembrance poppies.

Rye Bonfire Society burned a huge poppy display during their November 5 celebrations, leaving many spectators stunned.

The fire club, based in the East Sussex town, claim the display was torched to commemorate the centenary of the First World War.

But many visitors were appalled at seeing the ten-foot-tall poppies being put to the torch during the annual Bonfire Night event.

Visitors were left shocked after an 'effigy' of poppies was burnt at a bonfire event in Rye, East Sussex

Nakita Manlow, who attended the event, said: 'I am appalled at the choice of effigy. Not only was it distasteful but disrespectful too.

'If their intention was to celebrate the WW1 centenary, Rye Bonfire Society were short-sighted. There was no consideration to the way this would have been inferred by others.'

The local branch of the Royal British Legion also condemned the burning.

President Colonel Anthony Kimber said: 'I raised the issue with officers of the Rye Bonfire Society. I was reassured that the purpose was to mark and remember. 

'I did not witness the burning but envisaged what might happen.

'In my view the national symbol of Remembrance could have been given a prominent position at the event without destroying the display.

'There are differing views of Remembrance, but to burn the symbol of sacrifice and Remembrance was, at best, naive and ill-judged.'

While many were disgusted by the burning, some locals leapt to the defence of the society.

Barry Thomas, from Hastings, said: 'I was heartened to see the respectful commemoration.'

Organisers said: 'The tableaux was lit by red lances only and was not exploded, this was not an effigy'

Visitors to the event said they were shocked by the move, which was branded 'distasteful and disrespectful'

Tim Fellows added: 'Poppies in fireworks have been a feature of bonfire since the 1920's.

'As a descendant of a number of Bonfire Boys who gave their lives for this country, I am shocked at the criticism of Rye Bonfire Society in paying a tribute.'

Rye Bonfire Society issued a statement on Monday, which said: 'The tableaux - created to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War - was made in remembrance and to raise the profile of the Poppy Appeal and the good work the British Legion does.

'The Tableaux was lit by red lances only and was not exploded, this was not an effigy.

'Rye Bonfire was not making a protest, nor was it making any statement other than to highlight Remembrance, and we very much regret any offence this may have caused.

'The fact the tableaux was burned after discharge had no intended significance, any thinking differently that this was anything but an act of remembrance is regrettable.

'Rye Bonfire supports the Rye branch of the Royal British Legion in helping with the Remembrance Day service organisation and through donations and will continue to do so.'

The Sussex town has a long history of bonfire burning, which they say goes back to the time of the Vikings

Some in the town have defended the move, saying it is a traditional way of remembering the war dead
