Scandal-hit banks are facing an exodus of customers - with more than 1,000 people deserting them every day for mutual Nationwide.

Some 1,200 new current accounts are being opened daily at Nationwide alone, as customers reject rotten service, punitive fees and a string of mis-selling scandals, Britain’s biggest mutual revealed yesterday.

More than 430,000 new accounts were set up over the past 12 months. Nationwide is tempting new customers with a popular current account paying 5pc interest to those who stay in the black – more interest than you can get in any savings account.

Nationwide has revealed some 1,200 new current accounts are being opened daily as customers reject rotten service, punitive fees and a string of mis-selling scandals by other banks

It has also lured many customers from rival mutual Co-op which was tarnished by the drug revelations of former chairman Paul Flowers and poor financial performance including a £2.5 billion-pound loss.

A new switching service which ensures a seven-day transfer between bank accounts has also helped boost its appeal.

Although the building society couldn’t confirm where all its new customers were coming from, it’s understood the bulk stem from High Street banks including RBS/NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group.

Jafar Hassan, bank specialist at price comparison uSwitch.com says: ‘It’s a boon to see such huge numbers prepared to desert their banks.

‘At long last, people are confident to shake off mis-placed loyalty and go elsewhere for better treatment.’

Now with 5.5 million current account customers – a market share of 6.2 per cent - Nationwide is so far one of the biggest winners in the battle for bank accounts on the high street.

Graham Beale, chief executive, said: ‘Most people leave their bank because something wasn’t resolved or couldn’t be sorted. People do want an alternative and we want to be the place people come to.’

It picked up one in ten current switchers in March. However, the competition is getting fiercer.

Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer launched a free bank account with a £100 gift card and loyalty points in a bid to shake up high street rivals.

Others muscling in on traditional banks include the Post Office, which is rolling out new current accounts in branches, while Tesco Bank and Virgin Money will unveil new deals later this year.

Earlier this year, figures from the Payments Council – the body behind the new switching service – showed 609,300 customers had changed accounts in the six months to the end of March.

This is a 14 per cent rise on the 532,500 switches in the year before.

Under the new rules current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. It had taken up to 30. And money wrongly sent to the old account will be automatically swept into the new one for 13 months.

So far, nearly 2 million payments that have gone astray have been redirected to the new account.

A spokesman for the Payments Council said the service had removed the ‘fear factor’ from switching. However, experts have been disappointed that the overall numbers switching remain low.

‘With roughly 70 million of current account holders in the UK, the proportion prepared to up sticks for a better deal every year is low,’ said David Black, of analyst Consumer Intelligence. 

Graham Beale said that customers wanted an alternative and the Nationwide wants to be the place people come to

Last year, a report by the Office of Fair Trading discovered that three-quarters of people had never switched bank.

The vast majority of customers had never even considered switching, it found.

On average, only three in every 100 customers bother to switch accounts each year because they are fearful the move will go wrong.

Separately, the boss of Britain’s biggest building society said the UK’s housing market did not look set for a crash.

Fears of a bubble – with prices rising at up to 18 per cent in parts of London and 8 per cent across the country - have triggered concern of a crash.

Mr Beale said: ‘Anecdotally, there is some evidence of a slowing down in the housing market.

‘At the end of December 2013 and earlier this year, the market was quite frenetic; now it’s only busy.

‘All regions are now experiencing some growth but the big increases are mainly centred in London and the South East, and there are few signs of affordability being stretched in other UK regions.’

In the 12 months to April 4, it lent out £28.1 billion in home loans it said – nearly a third up on the year before.

One in five of first-time buyer mortgages were given by Nationwide.

If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
£100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf.

account to one of the Post Office’s Standard, Packaged or Control 
current accounts the bank will give you a £100 gift card.

Lloyds Bank is tempting 
desperate savers with its Club Lloyds current account - offering up 
to 4 per cent for balances between £4,000 and £5,000. But you will have to pay in at least £1,500.

TSB has also recently launched an interest-paying, the Plus Account pays 5 per cent on balances of up to £2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £500.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers
free travel insurance. It also operates a Refer a Friend scheme, 
whereby both parties will receive £50 if an existing customers
