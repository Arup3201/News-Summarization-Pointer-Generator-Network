A Jack Russell has claimed the title of Britain's oldest dog - thanks to her fussy diet of Peppa Pig pasta shapes and gluten free fish fingers.

Meg has reached the ripe old age of 25 by shunning regular dog food in favour of human treats.

The pampered pet - who is 113 in dog years - is now believed to be the oldest pooch in the UK following the death of the previous title holder, who died in July aged 23.

Meg was rescued from a puppy farm 23 years ago by doting owner David Abrahams when she was just 18 months old.

She developed a taste for soft food, such as canned Peppa Pig pasta shapes in a tomato sauce, after her teeth began to fail. Her other human favourites include, gluten free fish fingers and roast dinners.

Mr Abrahams said: 'I think she's lived so long because she's a tough little cookie and she's had the right diet and exercise.

'The fish fingers and the Peppa Pig pasta have helped her along the way.

'As she got older she got extremely fussy. She won't eat the same meal twice in a row. If you make her a roast beef dinner, the next day she won't eat it.

'With age she is picking at food more. She has a roast dinner sometimes twice a week when we have one. The rest of the time it is varied.

'Sometimes it is cat food, senior dog food, or soft pasta based things. Everyday she has something different.'

Mr Abrahams rescued Meg in 1999 and has looked after her at his home in Stoke St Michael, Somerset, ever since.

The pet is now 18 months older than the previous title holder of Britain's oldest living pet, a Jack Russell called Daisy which died aged 23-and-a-half in July.

Mr Abrahams' partner Maria, 62, said Meg has become quite picky with her food in her twilight years.

She said: 'We just feed her what she likes whether it's a selection of dog food or human food.

'She has a roast meal with us on a Sunday, which she absolutely adores, and she can't get enough of carrots or greens vegetables.'

David added: 'She can't cope with chews any more so the softer stuff really helps. With dog biscuits, we soften them up with warm water before she can eat them.

'Every time we go to the supermarket we try to think of something different to buy her.

'Her vet recommended softer food because her teeth were playing up. They are very old so we tried her on something soft.

'Is she spoilt? Of course. She is the greatest of little dogs and is truly loved by everyone.'

Meg nearly died from pancreatitis a few years ago but pulled through and is now living a healthy lifestyle.

Owner David Abrahams admits that Meg is spoilt, but describes her as the 'greatest little dog' who is 'loved by everyone'

'She can still run like a whippet when she wants to but tends to sleep a lot now,' said Mr Abrahams, who runs a motorbike dealers.

'Sometimes we have to prod her in the mornings to make sure she's still with us.

'We're dreading the morning that she's not but at the same time hope that she passes peacefully in her sleep in her favourite little sofa bed.

'She has been a brilliant companion.'

Meg's vet Sam Fowlie said: 'It is a rare for a dog to reach such an impressive age and is testament to the love and care that she has received from her owners.'

A Guinness Book of Records spokesman said: 'We do not currently have a record allocated for the 'oldest dog living' but we would welcome an application from Meg's owners.'
