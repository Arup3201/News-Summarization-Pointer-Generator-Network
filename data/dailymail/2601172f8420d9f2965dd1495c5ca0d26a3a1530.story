Leeds president Massimo Cellino arrived back in the United Kingdom in defiant mood on Tuesday and told the Football League it had 'made a big mistake' in disqualifying him from owning the club.

Cellino was holding talks in Bahrain with the club's former owner Gulf Finance House - the investment bank still control 25 per cent of the club's shares - when the Football League announced on Monday the Italian had failed its 'owners and directors' test'.

The league told Cellino he must stand down after finally receiving further evidence of dishonesty from the Italian judge who convicted him for tax evasion in March.

The 58-year-old will be entitled to return to his position at the club on March 18 next year when the conviction is spent under UK law. The league has said Cellino had 14 days to lodge an appeal.

'I don't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers,' Cellino told ITV. 'This club in the last five years has spent more money on lawyers than players.'

When asked to confirm he will appeal, Cellino said: 'Sure. I'm going to meet my lawyers. They (Football League) have made a big mistake.

'They're just throwing money from the window.'

Cellino took control of Leeds in April when his family company, Eleanora Sport Limited, bought 75 per cent of the club's shares from GFH.

The former Cagliari owner announced a new £20million investment in Leeds on Saturday and said he had successfully negotiated a £5million contribution from GFH after meeting with the investment bank's officials in Bahrain.

We have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until March 18 2015.

The club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League’s Professional Conduct Committee in April 2014.

The steps that the League wishes the club to take – to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months’ time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party. 

Cellino added: 'I solved a big problem (on Monday) in Bahrain. It was important for the survival of this club. This club now is financially strong, it looks to the future and we're going to present the facts.

'We're going to fix the club and the league is going to realise it's doing a big mistake.'

The league initially attempted to block Cellino's takeover of Leeds after his tax conviction in April, but the Italian successfully appealed.

But the judge who over-ruled the league's decision, Tim Kerr QC, said if it was later concluded that Cellino had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import duty on his yacht, he would fail the 'owners' and directors' test'.

Cellino faces a second similar charge of tax evasion on another yacht. The latest court case in Sardinia was adjourned in late October and it is understood a new date has yet to be confirmed.

The league has also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether Cellino breached league regulations by not disclosing information it had obtained from the Sardinian court which convicted him in March.

Press Association Sport understands there is no time limit on the commission's findings as this further breach of its rules is an entirely separate process.

It is also understood that Eleanora Sport could install a new management structure at Elland Road to satisfy the league that Cellino has no financial or executive influence on the club during his disqualification period. 

The Board of Directors of The Football League has, once again, considered the position of Leeds United President, Massimo Cellino, under its Owners' and Directors' Test.

Previously (March 2014), the Board had ruled that Mr Cellino was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under Italian tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat (which resulted in him being fined €600,000). In April 2014, this decision was successfully appealed by Mr Cellino at a hearing of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by an independent QC (sitting alone).

In reaching his verdict, Tim Kerr QC concluded that: “Mr Cellino has satisfied me that on the facts before me, what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest.” Before going on to state that: “if the reasoned ruling of the court in Cagliari discloses that the conduct of Mr Cellino was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest, he would become subject to a Disqualifying Condition.”

At its meeting last week, the Board considered the reasoned Judgment of the Italian Court against Mr Cellino, having successfully applied to the Italian Courts for its full disclosure. The Board considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously (with the exception of its Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest*) that Mr Cellino is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test.

Mr Cellino is entitled to appeal the Board's decision to the PCC within 14 days. As the Judgment of the Italian Court has not been published in Italy, The Football League will not make any of its contents public.

Additionally, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent Football Disciplinary Commission (FDC) to consider whether Mr Cellino and/or Leeds United breached League regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information. The matter will be heard by an FDC in due course.
