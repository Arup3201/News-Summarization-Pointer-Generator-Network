A miserable few days for Mark Cavendish continued on Monday with the news that he will also miss the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow after crashing out of the Tour de France on the opening day.

A statement from his Omega Pharma-QuickStep team confirmed that Cavendish had undergone further tests in London and did indeed need surgery on his shoulder.

‘The results underlined the need for surgery after it was confirmed that all ligaments around the AC-joint were ruptured and the shoulder separated,’ said the statement.

‘The surgery to stabilize the AC joint will take place on Wednesday.

‘The recovery time after the surgery will be around six weeks.’

Cavendish said: ‘It's worse than I was hoping but immediately after the crash I knew something was really wrong.’

Cavendish
 has already accepted the blame for an accident that brought down two 
other riders in the sprint for the line in Harrogate on Saturday.

But on Friday he came under fire from a fellow professional for his sprinting style.

Milan-San Remo winner Alexander Kristoff suggested the Manx Missile ‘lost his head a little bit’ when he tried to win the stage.

He even went as far as comparing Cavendish to footballer Luis Suarez.

‘Suarez
 was banned for biting people in soccer and to me it looked like he 
crashed on purpose,’ said Kristoff, who complained that the crash cost 
him the opportunity to challenge for the stage.

‘At
 60 kilometres an hour it's really dangerous and you can injure people, 
so it's not nice of him. It’s not the first time he's done this. I hope 
he calms down a little bit in the future. He's a brilliant sprinter but 
it looks like he lost his head a little bit.’
