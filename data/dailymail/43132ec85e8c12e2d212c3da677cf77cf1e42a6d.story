NASA is planning for a robotic spaceship to lasso a small asteroid and park it near the moon for astronauts to explore, a top senator revealed Friday.

The robotic ship would capture the 500-ton 25-foot asteroid in 2019. Then using an Orion space capsule, now being developed, a crew of about four astronauts would nuzzle up next to the rock in 2021 for spacewalking exploration, according to a government document obtained by The Associated Press.

Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the plan would speed up by four years the existing mission to land astronauts on an asteroid by bringing the space rock closer to Earth.

Nelson, who is chairman of the Senate science and space subcommittee, said on Friday that President Barack Obama is putting $100 million in planning money for the accelerated asteroid mission in the 2014 budget that comes out next week.

The Democratic Senator is also a former astronaut, he spent six days orbiting the earth in 1986 aboard the shuttle Columbia.

The money would be used to find the right small asteroid.

'It really is a clever concept,' Nelson said in a press conference in Orlando. 'Go find your ideal candidate for an asteroid. Go get it robotically and bring it back.

'While there are thousands of 
asteroids that size out there, finding the right one that comes by Earth
 at just the right time to be captured will not be easy, said Donald 
Yeomans, who heads NASA's Near Earth Object program that monitors 
close-by asteroids.

He said once a suitable rock is found 
it would be captured with the space equivalent of 'a baggie with a 
drawstring. You bag it. You attach the solar propulsion module to 
de-spin it and bring it back to where you want it.'

Yeomans said a 25-foot asteroid is no threat to Earth because it would burn up should it inadvertently enter Earth's atmosphere. The mission as Nelson described is perfectly safe, he said.

Nelson said this would help NASA develop the capability to nudge away a dangerous asteroid if one headed to Earth in the future. It also would be training for a future mission to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s, he said.

The government document said the mission, with no price tag at the moment, would inspire because it 'will send humans farther than they have ever been before.'

The mission was first suggested last year by space experts at the California Institute of Technology.

Projected to cost $2.65billion in 
total and last ten years, the project has found favor with the Obama administration, which has already announced a goal of sending 
astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025.

Researchers from CalTech's Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) detailed the plan in a paper published last spring.

'The idea of exploiting the natural resources of asteroids dates back over a hundred years, but only now has the technology become available to make this idea a reality,' the report says.

The KISS feasibility study suggests that bringing a 500-ton asteroid closer to Earth would give astronaut crews a 'unique, meaningful and affordable' destination for the next decade.

It adds: 'Placing an NEA [Near Earth 
Asteroid] in lunar orbit would provide a new capability for human 
exploration not seen since Apollo. Such an achievement has the potential
 to inspire a nation.

'It would be mankind’s first attempt at modifying the heavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space.'

The report outlines an entirely robotic mission to locate and capture a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), with a diameter of about seven meters and a mass of around 500,000kg.

It is hoped such a modestly sized space rock may contain up to 100 tons of water, 100 tons of carbon rich compounds, 90 tons of metals and 200 tons of silicates.

An 18-ton probe would be launched on an Atlas V rocket and use the Moon's gravity to slingshot itself towards its target in interplanetary space.

Once there, the spacecraft would deploy a massive inflatable bag to envelop the asteroid - maneuvering to stabilize against any tumble or rotation - then 'multiple "draw strings" would cinch-close the opening of the bag and also cinch-tight against the bulk material,' the report says.

It adds: 'Due to the residual velocity between the asteroid and the spacecraft, there would be some “impact” as the asteroid is captured.

'Although, since the asteroid would be much more massive than the spacecraft, it is perhaps better to think of this as the asteroid capturing the spacecraft.

An ion thruster is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft that creates thrust by accelerating ions.

Ion thrusters use beams of ions 
(electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust in accordance
 with momentum conservation.

They create very small levels of 
thrust compared to conventional chemical rockets but achieve very high 
specific impulse, or propellant mass efficiencies, by accelerating their
 exhausts to very high speed.

However, ion thrusters carry a 
fundamental price: the power imparted to the exhaust increases with the 
square of its velocity while the thrust increases only linearly.

Normal chemical rockets, on the 
other hand, can provide very high thrust but are limited in total 
impulse by the small amount of energy that can be stored chemically in 
the propellants.

Due to their relatively high power 
needs and the requirement of an environment void of other ionized 
particles ion thrust propulsion is currently only practical in space.

'Nevertheless, once the spacecraft and 
asteroid are tightly secured together, the spacecraft could then 
de-tumble the combination.'

Moving such a huge object using conventional rockets would need an enormous amount of fuel to be carried along with the probe.

So rather than using chemical rockets it would be equipped with a solar powered electric propulsion system.

Such
 'ion thrusters', as they are known, work by using electricity generated
 by solar panels to accelerate charged particles away from the space 
craft, ars technica explains.

Using these, the spacecraft could begin its long track back to the Moon, estimated to take between two and six years.

The
 announcement of the $100 million in funding for the project comes three
 months after Major-General James Bolden made a cryptic suggestion to a 
National Research Council committee on human space flight.

'When
 the President announced that an asteroid would be the next destination 
for NASA's human spaceflight program, he did not say NASA had to fly all
 the way to an asteroid,' he said.

'What matters is the ability to put humans on an asteroid.'
