A mother-of-two has been jailed for making two false rape claims against men she was dating after one, who she had met online, failed to show up for a liaison.

Emma Saxon, 23, from Sheffield, was jailed for eight months after telling police she had been raped in a BMW car in a supermarket car park.

The victim of her slur Martin Blood spent 14 hours in a police cell and suffered the indignity of an intimate medical examination while the police spent 90 hours investigating before finally concluding it was a hoax.

Jailed: Emma Saxon made a false claim of rape against Martin Blood, a man she had met online, after he failed to show up for a liaison

Sheffield Crown Court heard Saxon, 23, was given a community penalty in 2007 after a similar false allegation against a former boyfriend.

Jailing her Judge Michael Murphy said: 'Rape is such a terrible, diabolical offence that it is always treated very seriously in these courts. It is a dreadful thing for a person to be raped. It is a most serious allegation for one person to make against another. It is truly awful if it is untrue.'

Saxon, of Westfield, Sheffield admitted perverting the course of justice by making a false rape allegation.

Bev Tait, prosecuting, said a man rang the police saying Saxon had been raped in the car at a Sheffield supermarket ten minutes beforehand by a man called Martin.

An incident team swung into action and police traced the car driver within 20 minutes. Officers went to his address but found the car engine cold in the driveway and a dry patch where the car was standing although it had been raining heavily.

Despite their suspicions about the allegation police arrested Mr Blood and as well as being kept in a cell for 14 hours and being examined by a doctor his car was thoroughly searched.

Saxon was taken to the police station and also examined by a doctor but refused to take part in a video interview.

Ms Tait said it took a month for six police officers and a detective inspector to finally ascertain that the allegation was groundless.

Mr Blood told police he met Saxon on a dating site and for him it was a purely sexual relationship but she wanted something more and they would often exchange texts and arrange to meet up.

against a former boyfriend

On July 16, 2010 they exchanged texts about 9pm. He walked his dog an hour later and swapped more texts with her. She wanted to meet him and he said he would but had no intention of doing so.

He went to bed and the next thing he knew was when officers arrived at his home.

He said in a victim impact statement read in court that he was 'terrified' of the medical examination but went through with it because he was innocent.

When he asked for a glass of water in his prison cell an officer gave him a look as of he was 'scum' which he said would haunt him for the rest of his life.

He had been forced to take time off work as a school caretaker with stress and it was as if 'his entire life had fallen apart.'

Saxon was then arrested. She admitted she had an affair with Mr Blood but on the night in question she was pressurised by other people she was with to report him to the police.

In the previous allegation which was made in 2006 her ex-boyfriend was arrested and interviewed by police but Saxon then undertook a video interview before police concluded she was lying.

Rebecca Stevens, for Saxon, said she lived in supported council rented accommodation and had suffered with learning difficulties. 'The offence was unsophisticated and it was obvious to the police from the outset that there were suspicions about the allegation,' she said.

She was a 'vulnerable young woman' in the company of 'less desirable' people who bullied her into making the allegation and it was not her who initially reported the complaint.

Given her lack of co-operation with the police it was hard for her to admit she had lied and her refusal to give a video interview was an acceptance that 'what she was doing was wrong and she no longer wished to pursue the matter.'

By June last year she freely admitted the matter. She had difficulty in managing her everyday life and her two sons aged one and three lived with her mother. There was a real likelihood she would lose her home and children if jailed.

But Judge Murphy said the false allegation, the 'shame and degradation' suffered by Mr Blood through his false arrest and her previous conviction for a similar offence made jail inevitable. 'It is important that people understand that a false allegation of rape is a wicked thing to do,' he told her.
