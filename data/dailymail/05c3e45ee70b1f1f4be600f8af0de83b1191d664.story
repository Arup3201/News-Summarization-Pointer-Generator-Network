For all Jose Mourinho's pre-match posturing about how this was Chelsea's 'Academy Day' ahead of the match, he used this as an opportunity to allow some of the fringe players – who have sat frustrated on the bench for much of the season – to prove their worth. 

Petr Cech, Filipe Luis, John Mikel Obi, Andre Schurrle and Mohamed Salah all started, with John Terry, Eden Hazard and Willian given a break.

The only youngster he included in his squad for the match was Ruben Loftus-Cheek – and the 18-year-old midfielder had to make do with a place on the bench before coming on to make his first-team debut.

Sporting did not have a great record on these shores for keeping English sides at bay before kick-off – and it took only eight minutes for Chelsea to take the lead. 

Sporting have now failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their 13 European away games against English sides. Cesc Fabregas's early penalty was the 25th goal they have conceded in those matches.

Jose Mourinho opted to play Diego Costa from the start in a bid to get him fully match fit to prepare him for the punishing Christmas and New Year period of games.

The striker is not available for the Hull match at home on Saturday after picking up a fifth yellow card against Newcastle. Didier Drogba and Loic Remy had to make do with a place on the bench.
