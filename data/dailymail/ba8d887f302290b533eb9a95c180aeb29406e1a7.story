Jewell Berggrun, pictured, was swindled out of $500 from a 'suitor' on a Christian dating site

A woman says she was scammed out of $500 from a would-be suitor on a Christian dating site.

Jewell Berggrun, 54, from Winder, Georgia, told WSBTV that the man called her twice a day -- and that she fell in love before realizing what was going on.

'I put my heart out there, he took it and destroyed it,' she told the channel.

After her husband died of a heart attack, Berggrun turned to the free Christian dating site to find new love. She told WSBTV that she quickly fell for 'Alexi,' a man who said he was a Texas resident and did business in Malaysia.

'Alexi' told Berggrun ran into money problems, asking her for $8,000, the channel adds. She ended up giving him $500 through a wire transfer.

Berggrun quickly realized that 'Alexi' may not have been who he said he was, when she found out his photos were on three different dating sites using three different names, she said.

On top of her recent troubles, Berggrun told WSBTV that she is on disability and on a fixed income.

'I can't get any medication or groceries for the rest of the month,' she said. Authorities say it is unlikely she will get her money back from the man.

Her dating site experience is similar to one MailOnline reported on earlier this month, where a divorcee was scammed out of $500,000 on Christian Mingle.com.

The woman, 66, said she had been in contact with a Irish man named 'David Holmes' -- only to later find out he was Nigerian. His dating profile picture was allegedly that of a male model downloaded elsewhere.

She was eventually convinced by 'David Holmes' to wire him $300,000, followed by another $200,000 to a Turkish bank, Mail Online reported. She became suspicious and contacted authorities -- who were able to freeze her funds before the man's associate could collect them.

It is unlikely that she will be able to collect the remaining $300,000.

Berggrun says 'Alexi' initially asked for $8,000, but she only transferred him $500
