Chicago police have used facial recognition technology to identify and convict a thief - the first person to be captured thanks to the department's new technology.

Pierre D Martin, 35, was captured on Chicago Transit Authority surveillance footage robbing two men at gunpoint in separate incidents in 2013.

Martin was identified robberies using NeoFace technology that the police department bought with a $5.4 million federal grant.

The face that gave him away: Pierre Martin was identified using facial recognition technology and sentenced to 22 years

He is the first man arrested by Chicago police with the help of facial recognition technology and has been sentenced to 22 years in state prison.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports that 35-year-old Pierre D. Martin was sentenced this week.

Armed robbery: Martin's face was clearly visible in security footage

In February 2013, he was filmed approaching his 20-year-old victim on board a Pink Line train, pulling a gun on him and demanding his phone.

When the train began to move, he jumped off and escaped.

Martin committed a similar crime on a train platform in January 2013.

He was convicted by a judge last month of one 2013 robbery and then pleaded guilty to the othe robbery.

Using the facial recognition technology investigators could compare those images against 4.5 million criminal booking shots.

Martin, a convicted felon, came back as the number one match, then witnesses identified him in line-ups.

His mug shot was in the police database following convictions on aggravated unlawful use of a weapon in 2009 and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.

'This case is a great example that these high-tech tools are helping to enhance identification and lead us to defendants that might otherwise evade capture,' Cook County Stateâ€™s Attorney Anita Alvarez said in a statement.
