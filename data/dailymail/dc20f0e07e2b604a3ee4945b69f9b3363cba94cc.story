West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce says he is prepared to rest his new foreign stars during the busy Christmas period to protect them from burnout.

The likes of Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate have had a major influence this season, helping the club to fourth in the Barclays Premier League.

But the trio have not experienced England’s busy festive period, with many other nations taking a winter break.

And Allardyce is ready to risk upsetting fans after admitting he is willing to take his new stars out of the firing line.

‘When you come to November and December and get injuries - even though they might not be out as long they miss more games because they come so thick and fast,’ said Allardyce.

‘If players are out around Christmas they can miss six or seven games.

Sakho will be given until Saturday morning to prove his fitness to Sam Allardyce ahead of the Stoke clash

‘New players - Enner Valencia, Sakho, Kouyate and Mauro Zarate - won’t have hit that cauldron of mental and physical output during that particular period. Those players normally have a break.

‘Sir Alex Ferguson used to send players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani away at Christmas. He gave them a rest and then brought them back in and they kick on. I know what I’m doing.’

Meanwhile, Allardyce will make a late decision on the fitness of Sakho, who is suffering with a shoulder injury, ahead of Saturday's clash against Stoke.
