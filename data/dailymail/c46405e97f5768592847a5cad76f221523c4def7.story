Victoria Police have defended their investigation into a historic rape allegation made against Labour leader Bill Shorten after the woman who claimed she was attacked accused them of 'failing her'.

A month after Mr Shorten publicly dismissed rape claims against him as 'untrue and abhorrent' and Victoria Police found no case to answer, the woman who claimed she was raped by him in 1986 has waived her right to anonymity and accused the force of not investigating her allegations properly. 

The woman named Kathy, who agreed to be named and pictured by the Herald Sun, has claimed Victoria Police failed to locate witnesses after she handed them a 19-page statement detailing the alleged incident on October 23 last year.

However, a spokesperson for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'The matter has been investigated as would any allegation of sexual assault.

'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions which advised them there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.'

The woman named Kathy, who agreed to be named and pictured by the Herald Sun, has accused Victoria Police of failing to properly investigate 

Kathy, 44, told the newspaper: 'I don’t think I had a hope in hell with the police because of who he is.

'If Bill was just a regular guy I think it would have been different.' 

A spokesperson for Mr Shorten told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday: 'Bill doesn't have anything else to say, we refer you to his statement on August 21. He said he won't be making any more comments.' 

Deputy Labour leader Tanya Plibersek said in a press conference on Thursday, when asked about the woman's claims, that the allegations were 'thoroughly investigated by the police'.

'Bill Shorten cooperated fully, and that should be an end to the matter,' she added.

The Victoria Police spokesperson added that anyone who has concerns about the manner in which the investigation was conducted can contact the 'professional standards command or independent broad-based anti-corruption commission.' 

Kathy alleges she was raped during a Young Labor conference in Portarlington, near Geelong, Victoria, in the winter of 1986 after she had previously spoken to Mr Shorten about policy issues on the phone.

She claims the MP raped her in a bathroom in the early hours after a group came back to the camp after going out for a drive.

She said she gave the police three main witnesses, including the phone number of one and her maiden and married name, when she reported the crime. She  alleges police failed to find the witnesses.

On August 21, Mr Shorten released a brief statement in Melbourne which confirmed police had dropped their investigation into the claims.

'I will not go into the details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent,' Mr Shorten said at a press conference.

Mr Shorten revealed the investigation had been difficult for he and his wife Chloe Bryce, the daughter of former Governor-General Quentin Bryce.

'This has been deeply distressing for my family,' he added.

'I'm thankful for the love and support of Chloe and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.'

The alleged victim made claims on Facebook last year that she was assaulted at a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986.

'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions, which advised there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,' read a statement from Victoria Police.

Mr Shorten said 'there is absolutely no basis for the claim' during a brief statement

'All parties have been notified that Victoria Police will not be proceeding with criminal charges.'

Richard Marles, the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and a longtime friend of Mr Shorten, told 2GB at the time that it had been 'one of the worst moments of Bill's life'.

'I first met Bill in 1987 and I have been a close friend of Bill since that time. I know that these allegations are not true, because the person I've known is simply not capable of undertaking the allegations that have been made against him,' he told Ben Fordham on his radio program on 2GB.

'I have no idea what the motivations are behind the allegations that have been made.

'There's just no way that any of this was possible. These allegations surface almost immediately upon Bill becoming the leader of the Labor Party.

'It's been a really difficult time for Bill. I think this has been one of the worst moments of Bill's life. I think with this being dealt with in the background shows how tough a guy he is.'

Late last year I learned that a claim had been made about me, going back to when I was nineteen. It was made on social media, when I was elected Opposition Leader.

I will not go into details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent.

The allegation was made by someone I knew briefly at that time.

There is absolutely no basis for the claim.

The claim has now been thoroughly and rigorously investigated by police, as is entirely proper.

I fully cooperated to clear my name. And that is what I have done.

I freely answered all questions the police asked of me.

Now the police investigation has concluded, I can make this statement.

This has been deeply distressing for my family.

I am thankful for the love and support of Chloe, and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.

Others who were aware of the investigation have acted with the utmost integrity by leaving the police to do their job.

The police have now concluded the investigation.

The decision speaks for itself.

It is over.

I have no intention of making any further comment.
