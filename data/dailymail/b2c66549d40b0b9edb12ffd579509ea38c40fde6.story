Recovering: Russian banker German Gorbuntsov is back on his feet in hospital

The Russian banker shot six times near Canary Wharf in March is back on his feet again – and vowing to defy his enemies by continuing to live and work in London.

This exclusive photograph shows German Gorbuntsov, 46, who was gunned down in an apparent contract hit, learning to walk again in a privately funded room at an NHS hospital.

He revealed that he faces major new surgery this week on his wounds – but hopes to be discharged in about a month.

Yet his determination to remain in Britain could potentially run up a huge bill for the taxpayer in police protection.

‘They wanted me dead but now I’m walking,’  he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I can now manage about a third of a mile if I stay on the same level, and even climb 20 steps.’

A wound in his abdomen, where he was sprayed with bullets, will be treated during the latest operation.

He attributed his progress to the care of ‘the best medics in the world’ in an NHS hospital that cannot be identified.

The millionaire was treated without charge by the NHS for three months before moving into a private room at the same hospital under the care of the same doctors.

Mr Gorbuntsov is guarded round the clock by a Metropolitan Police team who will remain with him for the duration of the investigation.

‘I’ve already changed where I will live and organised a new office, so I will be simply doing the same as before at a different location,’ he said.

Recalling the shooting, he added: ‘The bullets started hitting my body and it was very painful.  I should have avoided moving to that location.

'It’s so quiet at night – now I will live in an area where it will be much more difficult to do the same.’

Mr Gorbuntsov’s asylum application, along with those of his wife Larisa, 46, and son Vladislav, 26, is pending.

So are applications from Russian Natasha Semchenkova, 36, with whom he was living when he was shot, and their baby son.

Safety: The 46-year-old is claiming political asylum in Britain for himself and his family, something which, if granted, could mean huge bills for the British taxpayer in police protection
