Muslims in Birmingham arranged a festival for 40,000 people to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan in just 16 hours.

Organisers 
contacted Birmingham City Council in advance, securing a licence for 
their festival by block-booking the event for Sunday, Monday and 
Tuesday. They held their highly successful event in the Small Heath Park
 in Birmingham. 

This is the third year Muslims have held their event in the Birmingham park on the day of Eid itself. 

Once
 the new moon was spotted over Saudi Arabia, Ramadan would officially 
finish the following day, allowing the celebration to take place. 

It
 is understood that Monday's festival was the largest ever of its type 
in the UK and, despite the short notice, catered for more that the 
35,000 people who went to Latitude in Suffolk. 

Prayers at the beginning of the festival took place at 9am with stalls selling halal sausages and ice cream.

Millions of Muslims across the globe have been celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan including these worshipers at the Jama Mosque in New Delhi, India earlier this morning

Luckily for the 40,000 Muslims celebrating Eid in Birmingham, they had far better weather than the 35,000 revelers earlier this summer attending the Latitude festival in Suffolk, pictured 

Eid also provides a summer boost for retailers with the so-called 'Ramadan rush' where thousands rich people from the Middle East travel

London's department stores are bracing themselves for a 'Middle Eastern gold rush' as scores of rich Arab shoppers are expected to hit the tills in what has become known as the 'Ramadan rush'.

Middle Eastern shoppers are expected to increase their summer spend by a quarter over the next three days on a quest to 'out-shop and outspend' each other as Eid al Fitr celebrations - which mark the end of the 29-day fasting period of Ramadan - begin.

Around 69 per cent of the total Middle Eastern spend in August 2013 was in major department and clothing stores, like Harrods and Selfridges.

Ramadan is the Muslim holy month of fasting where the observant refuse to eat or drink during daylight hours. 

However Muslims who are ill, pregnant or travelling can be excused from fasting. 

Smoking and sex is also prohibited in daylight hours during Ramadan.  

The timing of Ramadan changes because it is based on the Islamic lunar calendar, but it normally lasts around 30 days. 

As well as a time of prayer, Muslims during Ramadan are also expected to give money to the poor.

Once the crescent moon is sighted, normally in Saudi Arabia, Muslims celebrate the ending of Ramadan with the festival of Eid al-Fitr.

Families gather and have special prayers, give each other presents and eat sweets. 

Muslims often greet each other with the phrase Eid Mubarak, or 'happy Eid'.
