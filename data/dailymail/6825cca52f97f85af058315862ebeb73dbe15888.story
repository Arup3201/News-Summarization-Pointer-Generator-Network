They look like two teenagers who are besotted with each other.

The girl is Guadalupe Shaw, the 14-year-old 'bully' charged with a cyber hate campaign that drove schoolmate Rebecca Sedwick to her death.

And the boy is John Borgen, the teenager at the center of a feud between the two girls ultimately resulted in 12-year-old Sedwick's tragic suicide.

In an interview with MailOnline 13-year-old Borgen said he believed his continued affection for Sedwick could have been to blame for much of the bullying.

Jealousy: Borgen had dated Rebecca when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight years old

Young love: John Borgen posted these images of him and Shaw on his Facebook page. He has urged victims of bullying to 'speak up' in light of Rebecca's suicide

He had dated Sedwick when they were classmates at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, and had known her since she was eight years old.

After they split up he began dating Shaw - but said she was consumed with jealously because he made no secret of his affection for Sedwick.

'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said Borgen whose cover photo on his Facebook page shows him holding Shaw.

'She was didn't that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her.'

Speaking with the permission of his parents Pablo and Yolani at his home in Lakeland, Florida, the teenager said he was devastated that he did not know the full extent of the bullying suffered by his ex-girlfriend.

Sedwick took her own life on September 10 after jumping from a disused cement tower.

Prior to her death her computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl'.

Victim: Rebecca Sedwick jumped to her death on September 10. She would have been 13 this weekend

One of the teen's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track and she changed her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.'

Borgen, who told police Shaw had often verbally abused Sedwick, said he wished she had spoken up about the bullying.

'She never said anything to me, not a word. The only person she told was her mother.

'If I'd have known I could have said something. I miss Rebecca.'

Police believe Sedwick suffered a sustained hate campaign waged online and in social media by Shaw and her once closest friend, 12-year-old Katelyn Roman.

Both girls were identified by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd as being responsible for the hate messages sent to Sedwick in the months before her death.

The two girls have been charged with stalking and Judd took the unusual step of 'naming and shaming' the pair despite both being juveniles.

He is also looking into charging their parents as he believes they share part of the blame for allowing their children to post vile messages that drove Sedwick to kill herself.

In the middle: John Borgen previously dated Rebecca and her alleged tormentor Guadalupe Shaw

Shaw was arrested after she posted a message at the weekend confessing to bullying Sedwick and adding IDGAF -- teen speak for I don't give a f+++.

When Roman was interviewed by police she allegedly admitted to bullying Sedwick and said she was sorry.

Police said Roman had been Rebecca's best friend but had been turned against her by Shaw.

Shaw also intimidated other girls into ending their friendship with Sedwick.

Friends of Sedwick said they were intimidated by Shaw into not talking with her while she was at Crystal Lake Middle school in Lakeland, Florida.

Makayla Valentin told police said she saw Shaw verbally abuse Sedwick telling her to 'go kill herself.'

She also said Shaw told her love rival she 'should die'.

An arrest affidavit for Shaw released by Polk County Sheriff's office points to how Shaw made Sedwick's life a misery.

It says:'Valentin also stated Shaw would "bully" anyone who was openly friends with Sedwick, and would attempt to convince others not to be friends with her.

'For this reason Valentin stated "no one" wanted to be friends with Sedwick for fear of being bullied by Shaw. Valentin said she kept her friendship with Sedwick secret from Shaw.'

Tricia Norman, Sedwick’s mum, claimed in an interview with MailOnline that Shaw was the behind the bullying campaign and the reason she pulled her daughter out of the middle school.

'Shaw would call her ugly, call her fat,' said mother of three Mrs. Norman.

'The name calling kept on for weeks. Becca was friendly with a boy called Darren and Shaw sent him some very inappropriate messages.

Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca

'Becca told him they were not things a girl her age should be saying and the bullying started from there. Until the trouble at the Middle School Becca had not problems with either girl.

'Roman was her best friend, but that all changed.'

Mrs Norman has been using her daughter's death to highlight the problem of bullying in schools.

She told MailOnline she was "relieved" police had charged two girls with stalking and added that she was told Shaw could be charged as an adult which will result in a far harsher punishment than if she were a juvenile.

Borgen said he had dated Sedwick for three months before she left their Middle School to be homeschooled.

Sedwick's mother Tricia Norman had pulled her out of the school because of the bullying with her daughter suffering verbal attacks and once being set upon in corridor.

Borgen said his relationship with Sedwick ended when she left the school and he started going out with Shaw.

'Guadalupe is cool. I liked hanging round with her. She is nice, but I had no idea what she was doing to Rebecca.

'No one should be bullied like that. When I found out what happened I knew it was so wrong.'

Borgen,who turns 14 on January 1, said he planned to remove the photo of him hugging Shaw from his Facebook page.

Guadalupe's neighbor George Conlon said the family had a fearsome reputation in Lakeland and he had been harassed by the teen's older brother.

'Mowing my grass, cleaning my yard and boy comes and gets in my face and yelling obscenities and calling me names,' said Conlon.

Other school friends spoken to by MailOnline confirmed that Shaw was known as a bully.

One girl, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone was scared of her. She was tall and strong and used filthy words all the time.

'Anyone who crossed her was in big trouble. Unless you were her friend she was just nasty.'

In a TV interview the teen's parents denied that their daughter was a bully and claimed the taunting Facebook post that led to her arrest was because her account had been hacked.

The couple, who have seven children, declined to appear on camera and were filmed from the back showing only their heads and the interviewer on ABC TV.

They said they were angry over remarks by Sheriff Grady that their daughter was 'very cold' with 'no emotion' when arrested.

'My daughter don't deserve to be in the place she's in right now and I just hope that the truth comes to the surface so we can get out of this nightmare', her father told ABC News.

The family declined to speak with MailOnline.

Sheriff Judd dismissed their claim that their daughter's Facebook had been hacked and said they were in denial over her postings.

Police sources said officers had been monitoring the social media accounts used by many of the teens who had been interviewed during the investigation.

When the 'I don't give a F+++ ' post appeared he said they decided to make arrest to prevent further online bullying.
