A 'gangster's moll' who blew more than £75,000 of drugs money on a luxury lifestyle will only have to pay back £800.

Natasha Hugh, 28, spent £78,000 on an opulent wedding, top-class dental work and exotic holidays in the Caribbean.

The beautician was bankrolled by her boxing champion husband Justyn Hugh, 30, who made £400,000 bringing cocaine into the country from Albania and the Netherlands.

She spent thousands of pounds during a four-year spending spree, including £10,477 on her dream wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury hotel near Cardiff used by sports stars and celebrities. 

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh.

'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash installments.

'Mrs Hugh knew or should have known the money had come from crime.'

The mother-of-two spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,345 on bridal accessories ahead of her wedding to ex-Welsh Light Heavyweight champion boxer Justyn.

She also paid £5,000 in cash for a sporty Mini Cooper - which she later upgraded for a £19,570 Mini Countryman.

Hugh's luxury lifestyle was paid for by her husband after he trafficked five-and-a-half kilograms of cocaine into South Wales from London.

Judge Stephen Hopkins, sitting at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured), ordered Justyn Hugh to pay back £9,500 while Natasha must pay back £820 

Justyn Hugh, from Newport, South Wales, was caught following an eight-month police investigation and sentenced to 10 years in jail after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply a Class A drug.

His wife, also from Newport, was given 18 months in jail after being found guilty of possession of criminal property following trial.

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing was told the couple made more than £400,000 from their criminal activity but would only have to pay back the £10,320 that could be recovered by police.

Judge Stephen Hopkins, sitting at Cardiff Crown Court, ordered Justyn Hugh to pay back £9,500 while Natasha must pay back £820.

The judge told her he did not believe she had expressed any remorse for what she had done and that she had 'financially benefited' from her husband's drug dealing.
