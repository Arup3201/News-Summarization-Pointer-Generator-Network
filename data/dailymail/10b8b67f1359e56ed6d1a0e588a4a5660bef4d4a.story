It is not just emails like those of studio head Amy Pascal that are being leaked as a result of the recent Sony hack, but also scripts, as the upcoming screenplay for the latest Bond film, Spectre, has found its way online.

And while the first two acts of the film, starring Daniel Craig in his fourth outing as the iconic 007, are praised by executives inside Sony, the ending seems to be riddled with problems and in need of a serious rewrite.

This as the film has already begun filming, with a staggering budget of $300million which was revealed in emails that were leaked earlier this week.

The gang's all here: Plot and character details have been leaked along with the script for the new Bond film Spectre

Returning players: Ben Whishaw, Naomi Harris, Daniel Craig and Ralph Fiennes (above) will reprise their roles from Skyfall in the new film

Ladies night: Harris will be joined by two new female actors, Monica Belluci (left) and Léa Seydoux (right)

As has already been widely noted, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear will all reprise their roles from the recent Skyfall, with Monica Belluci, Christoph Waltz, David Bautista and Léa Seydoux joining the cast of the film, which will be directed by Sam Mendes.

Set to be released on November 6, 2015, the movie will film in London, Mexico City, Rome and Tangier and Erfoud in Morocco. Also included are such Austrian towns as Obertilliach, Lake Altaussee and Sölden, centering around Bond's quest to uncover a sinister organisation after receiving a cryptic message from his past.

And now, as a result of this leak, it is known exactly what will happen and what characters the new actors will be playing.

Exposed: Studio head Amy Pascal (above) has been the biggest victim of the hack, with hundreds of her email exchanges leaked

WARNING: SPOILERS! 

Not surprisingly, new addition Waltz will play the film's villain, Heinrich Stockmann, who also uses the alias Franz Oberhauser according to the script, which was seen by Defamer.

Stockman is revealed to be on of Bond's foster brothers, as well as the head of a terrorist group called Spectre, hence the film's title. 

As the villain is wont to do in most Bond films, he captures and tortures the secret agent, before Bond creates some sort of distraction or incident that forces the villain to travel  to London.

Bond eventually kills him there, though many studio executives are not a fan of how this happens.

One script note reads; 'ALSO, THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME KIND OF A PLOT TWIST RATHER THAN A SERIES OF WATERY CHASES WITH GUNS. THIS IS BLOFELD AFTER ALL. WHAT DOES HE HAVE UP HIS SLEEVE?'

Baddie: As had been speculated, Christoph Waltz (above with Craig) will play the film's villain

Complicated role: Newcome Andrew Scott (above) will also have a very pivotal, and interesting, role

The Blofeld reference is interesting as many had speculated that Waltz would be playing a descendant of Ernst Stavro Blofeld or a member of his family, the most famous of all the Bond villains who appeared in six films: From Russia with Love, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever and For Your Eyes Only.

In those films he is the head of a criminal organization known as Spectre.

Threre will also be another villain, and a duplicitous one at that, In Andrew Scott, who will play the head of MI-5, but secretly be working with Waltz's character.

Love interest: Seydoux will play Bond's love interest in the film

As for the women, Seydoux will be the man love interest, though their relationship seems to be problematic in the script.

Jonathan Glickman, the president of MGM's film division, writes that 'the relationship with Madeline is terrific.'

But Hannah Minghella, co-president of production at Columbia, semms to disagree, saying; 'If this is the movie that resolves the last three films then the emotional significance of that idea for Bond seems only lightly served at best. He finds the Vesper tape but never watches it.' 

She then adds; 'He appears to fall in love again for the first time since Vesper but there's no real emotional vulnerability there - why this girl? Why now? When he leaves with her at the end of the movie and throws his gun in the river has he gone for good or is this just a well earned vacation as is so often the ending of a Bond film.'

Extended cameo: Belluci will appear in just one scene of the film it appears

Belucci meanwhile seems to be in and out, playing a woman seduced by Bond to give up information after he kills her husband.

As for rumors that the film would star a lesbian character, they too seem to be true, with the character named Irma and the actor playing her still unknown.
