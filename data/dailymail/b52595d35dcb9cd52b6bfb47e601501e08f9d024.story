An ice hockey fan who suffered a cardiac arrest in the stands was given life-saving CPR - from the goalkeeper.

The middle aged man collapsed struggling to breathe minutes before amateur squad the Gander Flyers took to the arena in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada.

Wearing skates, hockey pants and one shin pad, 26-year-old Patrick O'Brien, a paramedic, rushed out of the dressing room to help.

'I just hopped in and started chest compressions,' O'Brien told the Gander Beacon following the incident on Sunday, just five months after completing his medical diploma.

He continued until the emergency services arrived with defibrillators.

The man, who remains unidentified, was unconscious with no pulse.

After two shocks, he was taken to James Paton Memorial Regional Health Centre where he is now in a stable condition.

O'Brien has been hailed as a hero - but shunned the praise.

Shunning the praise: O'Brien, who is a trained paramedic, said he was more nervous about playing hockey

'There was lots of help,' he said, thanking Gander Mayor Claude Elliott and Flyers board member Tom Whelan, both former paramedics who rushed to his assistance.

'It wasn't just me,' he said.

'Anyone would have done what I did. I guess it's just where it was at the rink and I had some of my gear on. But it's what I do. It happens with some level of regularity [while on duty].'

He added: 'I suppose it might have been easier for me to get ready for the game, given what I do for a living. 

'I was probably more nervous because I hadn't played in a while.'
