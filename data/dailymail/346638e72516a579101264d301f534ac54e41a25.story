A five-star Turkish resort is calling all snap-happy travellers to apply for a summer job - as a Chief Instagram Officer.

Tech-savvy tourists are being invited to spend a week each at the stylish Hillside Beach Club in Fethiye for free - and all they need to do is update the hotel's social media.

Dubbed 'Heaven on Earth', the hotel has decided it is desperately in need of people to spend seven days each lounging on the pristine beach, swimming in the sea and sipping sundowners - documenting their experience online.

Say cheese: The social media-savvy Instagrammers will be asked to post photos of their trip

And how should they apply? Through Instagram of course.

The hotel is calling on people to submit their best beach photos with @hillsidebeachclub under the hashtag #jobatheavenonearth before June 15.

The post, which is perhaps one of the most relaxing summer jobs on the market, will be offered to six successful applicants who will each spend a week sunning themselves at the resort.

There will be plenty to sample. Set in its own bay and backed by green mountains, the hotel has three beaches, two of which are adults-only and one which is a 'silent' beach, concentrating of calm and tranquility.

They can also sample the two spas and take to the water for wakeboarding and waterskiing classes.
