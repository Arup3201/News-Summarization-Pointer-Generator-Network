A photographer who spent two weeks trekking  across the Arctic is sharing incredible images from his epic 1,800-mile journey.

Peter Cox, 39, captured the awe-inspiring shots of melting glaciers and wildlife using a camera attached to a drone.

He travelled across Norway's Svalbard archipelago in a bid to document the area's stunning natural beauty.

As well as incredible drone footage, heart-warming stills caught Arctic fox cubs playing around

Accompanied by a group of photography tourists, Cox controlled the drone remotely from the ground giving viewers an amazing aerial view of the remote wilderness.

Cox, from Killarney, Ireland, said: 'The video shows the beauty of the Arctic environment from the standpoint of a group of photographers.

'There were some difficulties with the drone used to capture the aerial footage - it didn't like being that far north and ended up nearly crashing a couple of times because of compass problems.'

The video has received rave reviews online, and Cox added: 'I think people really enjoy seeing such a remote and beautiful environment from a different perspective.'

His video captures the journey of a ship navigating its way through giant icebergs, polar bears relaxing on the snow and walruses frolicking in the sea.

Still images taken throughout the journey not only capture the awe-inspiring beauty of the icy landscape, but also Arctic animals in their habitat.

Writing on his website, Cox says: It was a place that Kevin (Raber, a colleague on the trip) and I were very keen to return to after our trip there in 2013.

'The Arctic gets under my skin in a way that few other locations have. Dramatic landscapes, beautiful and plentiful wildlife and, of course, ice.'

Peter Cox has won numerous awards for his stunning photography and now resides in Ireland

Cox is a member of the Irish Professional Photographers Association (IPPA) and in late 2008 received the organisation's associateship award. This is the second-highest qualification in the association and has been achieved by less than 10 per cent of the membership.

He was also named ‘Landscape Photographer of the Year’ in both the single image and portfolio categories at the National Photographic Awards in 2007. 

The name Svalbard means 'cold coasts' and was first mentioned in Icelandic texts in the 12th century. 

Nearly 65 per cent of the surface of Svalbard consists of protected areas, including three nature reserves, six national parks, 15 bird sanctuaries and one geotopical protected area.

Norway's largest glacier, Austfonna, is located on Svalbard. Austfonna is the world's third-largest icecap after Antarctic and Greenland, with a glacier front of 186 miles.
