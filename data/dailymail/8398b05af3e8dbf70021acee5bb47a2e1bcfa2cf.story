A daredevil has beaten the record for the furthest unassisted flight in a 'birdman' competition.

Ron Freeman soared 159.8metres in the Worthing International Birdman competition yesterday, passing his 141.5metre record set at the event last year, organisers said.

Mr Freeman, the reigning champion, could now land the £10,000 top prize at the event which sees people throw themselves off the Sussex seaside town’s pier in machines and costumes.

A spokesman for the event confirmed Mr Freeman’s distance, adding that his adapted hang glider the Geordie Flyer had a large wingspan.

He said: 'He overlapped the edge of the platform that the competitors jump off.'

On its official Twitter, competition organisers said: 'Ron Freeman got an official score of 159.8m well done another new record for Worthing Birdman.'

To win the prize, Mr Freeman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, needs another good run today.

Competitors in his Condor Class for serious attempts have their final scores based on flights on both days of the event.

Last year he missed out on the money after strong winds forced him to take a sideways rather than a forwards route off the pier.

Mr Freeman was not the only flier today to pass the 100 metre mark that competitors have to pass to be eligible for the £10,000 prize.

Tony Hughes sits in second after soaring 117.1 metres in X Plane VIII, down on the 132.5 metre best he posted last year.

They were among 25 competitors taking part yesterday, ranging from the serious to the wacky, including one who jumped off dressed as a Minion from the cartoon film Despicable Me.
