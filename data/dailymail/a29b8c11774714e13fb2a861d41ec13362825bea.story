In the dead of the night 70 years ago, more than 1,000 Japanese men stormed the barbed wire perimeter fences of Cowra prisoner of war camp in central NSW.

Armed with improvised weapons including baseball bats and sharpened kitchen knives, hundreds of Japanese prisoners overcame machine gun posts in what would become the biggest POW escape of World War II.

The mass breakout at the detention camp on August 5, 1944 resulted in a 10-day manhunt as Australian soldiers and police searched for hundreds of armed escapees roaming the Cowra countryside, 300km west of Sydney.

This Japanese prisoner of war was one of hundreds who were injured or killed when they tried to escape from the Cowra camp in central NSW in August 1944 - it was to become the biggest breakout of World War II

A total of 359 Japanese prisoners escaped and the death toll reached 231 in the days following, including 31 suicides and 12 who perished in huts they had set on fire themselves.

Four Australian soldiers were killed in the breakout, including Privates Benjamin Gower Hardy, Ralph Jones and Charles Henry Shepherd. Lieutenant Harry Doncaster was killed when he was ambushed during the rounding up of passengers. 

Japanese man Teruo Murakami, who took part in the infamous Cowra breakout, returned to NSW for the 70th anniversary earlier this month as survivors and descendants gathered in Cowra for a memorial service.

This Japanese prisoner ended his own life during the Cowra breakout to avoid being captured. The kitchen knife he used was still clutched in his hand

He was among the 2,200 Japanese held captive in the prison, alongside nearly 20,000 other prisoners that Allied forces had captured in countries across the world.

Mr Marakami's translator and historian Mami Yamada said despite being the biggest breakout of World War II, many Japanese didn't know about it.

'In Japan, maybe more than 95 per cent of people do not know even the name of this event,' she told the ABC.

A number of knives and improvised weapons were found in the compound immediately after the mass escape

Baseball bats, iron piping and axe handles were among the weapons used by prisoners

Prisoners used baseball gloves as protection for when they climbed the barbed wire fences surrounding the camp. These gloves were found scattered in and around the camp

Blankets were thrown over the camp's fences as extra precaution against the barbed wire

Gloves handmade out of leather were found around the barbed wire surroundings of the camp

Some prisoners were killed trying to climb over the barbed wire as the escaped in the early hours of the morning

A number of huts were destroyed by fire as Japanese prisoners set them alight. Twelve people perished in these huts

'I have been trying in the last 21 years to let the Japanese people know that it was happening like this.'

Japanese prisoners chose to strike at 2am on August 5 - the day many were due to be transferred to different camps.

Screaming prisoners stormed the camp's  fences and historical photos show how they used blankets and clothing to protect themselves from the barbed wire.

'Many escapees chose to take their own lives rather than be recaptured,' historical writer David Hobson said.

'Two threw themselves under an oncoming train, while many hanged themselves. On their recapture, some pleaded to be shot. Others surrendered peacefully. At least two prisoners were shot by local civilians and several by military personnel.'

A Military Court of Inquiry investigated the incident and the Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, read the findings in September 1944.

Various media reported the escape of prisoners from Cowra and the widespread manhunt it required to track them down

This press cutting from the Sydney Daily Mirror reported that all Japanese prisoners who escaped had been captured

The investigation found conditions at the camp were in accordance with the International Geneva Convention and there had been no complaints from prisoners regarding their treatment in the lead up to the breakout. 

Mr Curtin’s statement also suggested that the attack was characterised by 'a suicidal disregard of life'.

For 50 years following World War II, the most famous prison escape was out of Nazi Germany’s Stalag III camp in March 1944.

Allied prisoners spent months digging tunnels out of the camp and the attempt was immortalised in the 1963 movie The Great Escape.
