The male model who last week accused Kevin Clash, the voice of Elmo, of having sex with him while he was underage stands by his story, claims he was pressured into recanting it, and is now seeking legal advice on how to undo his settlement.

The $125,000 settlement was struck between the two men several hours before the accuser, Sheldon Stephens, 23, officially retracted his underage sex allegation.

Under the terms of the settlement, if Stephens is asked by anyone about his relationship with Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: 'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with Mr. Clash was an adult consensual relationship.'

Sheldon Stephens now wishes to undo the $125,000 settlement that he signed last week with Clash's lawyers

Stephens reportedly cried during final 
negotiations with Clash's lawyer and repeatedly insisted he didn't 
want to sign.

He has apparently met with 
lawyers in Los Angeles and told them he was pressured into recanting his
allegation and insists he's telling the truth when he says he had sex 
with Clash when he was 16, reports TMZ.

Stephens, a struggling actor/model, is now telling lawyers he will gladly forfeit the $125,000 settlement to restore his name. 

Accusations that Clash, who is openly gay, engaged in an underage sexual affair set off a media firestorm after they were revealed last Monday. Within 24 hours of the story breaking, Stephens recanted his claim.

After Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a 
spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to 
rest. I will not discuss it further.'

Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, 
has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the
popular children's TV show on PBS.

Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage

Clash, 52, had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop since the scandal broke

Andreozzi & Associates, the law firm representing Stephens, did not return requests for comment from MailOnline.

On his Twitter account, Stephens describes himself as an 
'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor.' On 
his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. 
I'm very spontaneous and random… I'm determined and goal oriented. My 
destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and
never will it dim.'

Court records show Stephens has 
been arrested several times since 2009 on charges including writing a
bad check and reckless driving.

His most serious charges were in 
September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in his hometown of Pennsylvania 
after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles.

He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knife-point.

Pollard accused Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint.

Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California.

Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.'

The puppeteer told the man almost 30 years his junior 
that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New 
York, it has emerged.

The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual 
relationship with the accuser, but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult.

In emails sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.'

He added: 'I want you to know that I love
you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure 
your dreams come true...

'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.'

Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply 
saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.'

The 
accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers.

In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a
letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit 
the victim in order to protect its 
employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.'

The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of
a young man.'

Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was 
unsubstantiated after a thorough 
investigation.

They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received.

TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, 
acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the
accuser never mentioned such an email existed.

In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want'

Sesame Street disciplined Clash 
for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to 
the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual 
relationship.

They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed

his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations.

Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said.

Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards.

He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials.

He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud.

Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.
