When notorious mafia boss Michele Zagaria was seized from a secret bunker by police last December after 16 years on the run,  jubilant police could be seen cheering and making the V-sign.

Now it appears the threat posed by the gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder has not gone away, and he is communicating with his fellow gang members through coded letters.

Crime author and mafia expert Roberto
Saviano made the claim after analysing a hand-written letter addressed to Zagaria, the former head of the 
Camorra's Casalesi clan, which was intercepted by investigators.

Victory: Italian police arrested Michele Zagaria last December after 16 years on the run. He was the most senior boss of the Camorra mafia still at large

In an analysis for the Italian daily La Repubblica, Saviano says the letter uses 'cryptic and allusive' language and 'a real construction of coded messages' to give information about how the restructuring of the clan, its activities with other crime groups, and its contact with corrupt politicians.

He cites the sentence: 'the friends are going on holiday and they took the home-made jam and they say 'hi',' and says this probably means that clan members are due in court but will keep their mouths shut.

They thought it was all over: Italian policemen were jubilant after Zagaria's arrest last December. Now a letter to him suggests he is being kept informed of developments within the notorious Casalesi clan

The line 'We're all well and the children are growing up' could well refer to appointments and promotions that followed the jailing of senior clan members including Zagaria, says Saviano.

Zagaria is nicknamed Capastorta, or 'twisted head', in a reference either to his violent reputation or his asymmetrical features.

'At the market we filled the car with fruit' could refer to arms, hand grenades being commonly known as pineapples, or to lucrative dealings in large fruit and vegetable markets, which are often run by mafia clans.

Saviona even asserts that a line about 'Uncle Nicola in his gallery' appreciating 'everything that he's heard' could allude to Nicola Cosentino, a former junior economics minister of Silvio Berlusconi, who some MPs want arrested over his alleged links to the Camorra.

Control: Al Pacino in the 1972 film The Godfather immortalised the mafia's notoriety

Mr Saviano admits that despite being an authority on the Naples mafia – he has lived under armed guard since the publication of his best-selling book Gomorrah: Italy's Other Mafia – much of his interpretation of the letter is speculation.

He said even the recipients might not understand the contents of such letters until subsequent events – such as arrests or killings – provide meaning or context. However what was not in doubt was that Camorra members used a complex system to ensure their words could not be used against them in court, he said.

The clan, notorious for its violence, is heavily involved in supplying drugs to the Mafia in Palermo and has alliances with Albanian mobsters and Nigerian crime syndicates.
