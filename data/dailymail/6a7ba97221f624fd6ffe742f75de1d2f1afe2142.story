An Australian camera crew have captured endearing footage of the devastating effect of the Ebola virus in one of the hardest hit areas of Sierra Leone.

The team of journalists, who were the last camera crew in the area before a government lock down forced them to leave, were recording the stories of a number of Australian volunteers working alongside the infected and their families at an emergency centre near the borders of Liberia and Guinea.

Since the most recent outbreak in March of this year, the Ebola virus has killed more than 1427 people in West Africa, according to the World Health Organisation. This figure continues to grow and appears to be close to dwarfing the total number of deaths recorded in outbreaks between 1976 and 2012; 1590.

The disease is highly contagious, has no cure and with a fatality rate of 90 per cent, leads to an incredibly painful death.

Malcolm Hugo, an Australian Psychologist, is one of the many health professionals working at a crisis coordination centre in a town called Kailahun alongside the International Red Cross, Medecins Sans Frontier and the World Health Organisation. 

The centre is complete with an isolation ward where patients battle to survive through the 21 day cycle of the illness, but where 6 out of 10 people die.

Dr Hugo, who provides counselling services to people with Ebola, their families and even medical workers, is responsible for finding foster homes for children who have lost both their parents to the virus.

He said one of his hardest roles was separating children from mothers who could be carrying Ebola.

Malcolm Hugo, an Australian Psychologist providing counselling to people with Ebola, their families and  medical workers, said his most 'heartbreaking' role is separating children from mothers who could be carrying Ebola

‘It’s always a heartbreaking moment to actually tell the parent that it’s in the best interest of the child to separate from the mother and in two cases they were actually breastfeeding, so it is very difficult to persuade them to give up their children, and then the problem arises who is going to look after the child in a safe environment,' Dr Hugo said.

'People are scared, and anybody who has been here faces a huge problem with stigma and marginalisation when they go home.

'Giving really correct timely information to the community, is really important, I guess given the kind of suddenness of the epidemic, and the catastrophic impact it’s had on small communities where whole families have been wiped out.'

Dr Richard Broome, a NSW Public Health physician who was sent to the coordination centre to assess the effectiveness of the strategy, explained how local customs and emergency workers were colliding in their response to the outbreak.

'The environments in which people are living is absolutely a critical part of the effectiveness of the spread of this outbreak,' Dr Broome said.

'There’s a lot of beliefs in black magic and those traditional beliefs, so people often explain things through witchcraft and curses. All those things come together I suppose with the disease like Ebola to result in the explosive outbreaks.’

But amongst the tragedy there are stories of remarkable survival, including a little two-and-a-half-year old girl who lost 17 members of her family to Ebola but endured and conquered the illness herself.
