The salon is supposed to be a place of rejuvenation but that sanctum of relaxation was breached at one New Jersey shop when a dissatisfied customer attacked two employees with acetone over a broken nail.

Hakera D Cochran, 29, went to get her nails done at Mei Holiday Nails in Bridgeton on Friday, but returned to the salon later in the day when one of her nails broke and she got into an argument with the staff.

Witnesses say Cochran refused to calm down, even after being asked by employees.

At one point she grabbed a bottle of nail-polish remover and squirted it in the faces of two of the employees.

Paramedics responded and treated both employees for their injuries at the scene. Both declined to go to the hospital.

Police arrested Cochran and charged her with one count of aggravated assault and one count posession of a weapon for unlawful purpose.

After being processed, Cochran was released from jail on her own recognizance pending a trial.
