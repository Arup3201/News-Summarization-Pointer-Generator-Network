Rowland and Elsie Olarenshaw met when he was 14 and she was 13 living in the same street in Fairfield, Melbourne.

Mr Olarenshaw celebrated his 100th birthday in December last year and today Mrs Olarenshaw joins him in centenarian status.

Rowland and Elsie Olarenshaw recently celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary and today mark Mrs Olarenshaw's 100th birthday

The pair – who are Australia's oldest married couple after marking their 80th anniversary last year - will celebrate Mrs Olarenshaw's birthday with a café lunch with 30 relatives and friends.

Mr Olarenshaw remembers first meeting Mrs Olarenshaw when his father bought a house two doors down from hers.

'We were kids playing in the street more or less in those days,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We grew up together.'

Mr Olarenshaw said that by the time they were 19 they had fallen in love and decided they wanted to get married.

But it was the middle of the Great Depression and their parents were less than supportive.

'Our respective parents were horrified,' he said.

'They said "Where is the money going to come from?"'

But the couple didn't care and they got married in a simple ceremony at Collingwood Baptist Church on November 11, 1933 by the same minister that married Mrs Olarenshaw's parents.

The couple, pictured with two of their children in 1936, had five daughters but one died when she was 60 years old

Mr Olarenshaw worked as a general engineer and owned his own business for 34 years, while Mrs Olarenshaw stayed at home and raised their five daughters.

'We did have five but unfortunately we lost one when she was 60 years old,' Mr Olarenshaw said.

'She had a bad series of operations that affected her brain and she got dementia.'

The couple say they have 'lost track' of how many grandchildren and great-grandchildren they have.

Mr Olarenshaw said he was proud to be in Australia's longest marriage but he didn't think there was a secret to their happiness other than 'just being compatible'

The Olarenshaws now live in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, and Mr Olarenshaw cares for his wife 24 hours a day because she suffered a bad fall 18 months ago.

Mr Olarenshaw is proud to be in Australia's longest marriage but he doesn't think there are any secrets to their happiness.

'Just being compatible,' he said.

'You have your difficulties but you've just got to get over them.'
