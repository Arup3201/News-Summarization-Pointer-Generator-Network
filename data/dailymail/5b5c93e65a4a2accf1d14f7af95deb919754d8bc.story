Free: Paedophile Gary Karn 48, sexually assaulted two girls aged seven and eight on an allotment but has been spared jail

A paedophile who avoided jail because was worried his family would be affected if he went to prison is having his sentence reviewed.

Gary Karn escaped with just a suspended sentence after being convicted of sexually abusing two little girls as they picked fruit at his allotment.

But following public outrage at the case, the Attorney General is now considering whether to launch an appeal against the sentence.

The 48-year-old father of three inappropriately touched his victims, aged seven and eight, after inviting them into his greenhouse to help themselves  to raspberries.

He was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against a child at Norwich Crown Court earlier this week.

Judge Mark Lucraft imposed an 18-month suspended sentence, saying a jail term would unfairly affect his family as he would probably lose his job in a food processing factory.

‘I have to consider the impact on them - people who are not in any way at fault yet might suffer serious hardship from your actions,’ he said.

But the father of one of his victims said: ‘He talks about the effect on the offender’s family, but what about the effects on my family?'

It was revealed today that a member of public has asked the Attorney General's Office to review whether the sentence might have been 'unduly lenient'.

The office is considering the case, and must decide whether to refer the sentencing to the Court of Appeal by May 22.

The court heard Karn invited the 
girls on to his allotment. He told them that he needed to brush spiders 
off them then put his hands up the top of one girl, and down the 
trousers of the other.

He 
was also charged with six counts of possession of extreme pornography 
and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child.

Mr Lucraft decided not to proceed with these offences but took them into consideration.

Jude Durr, defending, had told the judge: ‘Imprisonment will almost certainly lead to him losing his job.

'If he loses his liberty and they lose
their house, that would have pretty devastating consequences on the 
family circumstances.’

The decision outraged the victims’ 
families, who said the girls have been left traumatised from both the 
incident and the ordeal of having to give evidence in court.

The father of the eight-year-old added: ‘I find it all very disgusting. The judge has been too lenient.’

He told how the two girls were 
playing on his allotment last September when Karn invited them to pick 
vegetables and fruit on his plot.

The next morning the mother of one 
the girls overheard the pair saying they ‘didn’t want to talk to the man
down the allotment’ again.

The girls then told what had happened
after breaking down in tears when preparing a salad using vegetables 
from Karn’s allotment.

The father continued: ‘I feel totally let down. The judge lives in cloud cuckoo land.

‘It has caused arguments between me and my wife – it happened on my watch. It has caused a lot of anguish and grief.’

He added: ‘I told my daughter that 
she wouldn’t have to see that man ever again and it is all over and done
with and now he is going to be walking around – how do you explain that
to an eight-year-old? It will just confuse her.

‘We have put her through this –and ourselves – and for what? If I had known the outcome I would not have bothered.’

Talking about how it has affected his
daughter, the father said: ‘There are noticeable little differences. 
She won’t stay upstairs in bed any more if her mum gets up and she 
carries her teddy everywhere as a comfort toy.

‘What scares me is that I am one of 
those parents who encourages my children to talk to people and 
acknowledge them when they are spoken to. The allotment is the last 
place I would have expected this to happen.’

Mr Lucraft suspended Karn’s sentence for two years and banned him from working with children for five years.

He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and was given a five-year sexual offences prevention order.
