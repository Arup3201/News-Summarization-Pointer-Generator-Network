Police divers have recovered a body and a gun from a dam at the NSW Riverina farm where a woman and her three children were earlier found shot dead.

The gun and body, believed to be that of the children's father 44-year-old Geoff Hunt, was recovered from the dam about 2pm on Wednesday after a white ute was found nearby.

His wife Kim Hunt, 41, and children Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8 and Phoebe, 6, were found murdered on Tuesday afternoon at the homestead on Boree Creek Road, northwest of the town of Lockhart, some 80 kilometres south of Wagga Wagga.

Police told Daily Mail Australia the body retrieved from the dam had sustained serious injuries and authorities were not looking for anyone else in relation to the investigation.

'I don't think even the most hardened professional could remain unmoved by what's out there,' Wagga Wagga Local Area Commander Superintendent Bob Noble told reporters.

'It's certainly not something I've encountered anything similar to before, and I hope not to ever again.'

Police believe the Ms Hunt and her children were killed early Tuesday or late on Monday.

Police would not comment on reports a suicide note had been found at the property

Supt Noble said the focus of the investigation was locating the 44-year-old father who hasn't been seen since police made the grim discovery.

Police divers commenced the search for him at a dam at the property on Wednesday after a white ute was found abandoned nearby. A ground search was also conducted on the large rural property.

Supt Noble would not comment on reports a suicide note had been found at the property. He had earlier also declined to say whether or not police were confident of finding Mr Hunt on the farm.

The three children were found inside the house while their mother's body was found behind the homestead, according to police.

St Josephs Catholic School, where the three children attended, flew its flag at half mast on Wednesday to honour the family

Ms Hunt's colleagues at the Lockhart District Hospital are said to be devastated by news of the deaths.

'Kim is remembered as a bubbly, positive, caring and passionate nurse who was dedicated to patient care,' Murrumbidgee Local Health District spokesperson Jill Ludford said.

'She was very excited to still be able to use her skills and knowledge to educate other nurses.

'Her death is a huge loss and she will be greatly missed by all of her colleagues and friends.'

Two years ago, she was found in a critical condition after her car flipped twice on Lockhart Boree Creek Road with her four-year-old daughter inside.

A post-mortem is yet to be carried out on the bodies, but it is believed the family suffered gunshot wounds

Ms Hunt's husband Geoff did not leave his wife's side in hospital while her condition slowly improved.

'She's been showing signs of waking over the last two days and she's been making progress,' he told The Daily Advertiser at the time.

'She's a great mum and a very caring person.'

The flag at the St Joseph's Primary School, where the children attended, flew at half mast on Wednesday as its 74 pupils, teachers, students and parents mourned.

Like many small rural schools, parents lend a hand, with Mr Hunt rostered on for lawn mowing duties for the first two weeks of September, according to the school's newsletter.

Father Tony Schipp, who led a Mass at the children's school on Wednesday, said nobody in town had suspected anything was amiss with the local farmer in the lead up to this week's events.

'Nobody that I've spoken to indicated that they were aware that anything was amiss,' Father Schipp told AAP.

'He was happy. He was making arrangements for events that were coming up, that he was going to be part of.

'There was no hint or signal of any internal stress factors at all.'

Local police, SES members and a forensic team worked through the night

The victims were found at a property in Lockhart. The property is south of Boree Creek - a small town 80 kilometres west of Wagga Wagga

The tragedy at the property has sent shockwaves through the quiet town, with a population of only 900

The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the quiet town, with a population of only 900, with friends and neighbours of the nurse and her children finding it difficult to describe their shock.

'We are devastated by the tragedy, it's unbelievable,' Lockhart mayor Peter Yates told Daily Mail Australia.

'I knew the family and the people that were involved were well-respected people, a farming family.

'I just can't believe it, especially when there's children involved. They had their whole lives ahead of them.'

Deputy mayor Roger Schirmer described Mrs Hunt, a former intensive care nurse who had recently started work at Lockhart hospital, as 'a lovely person' with 'a lovely family'.

He also said the area had experienced 'pretty tough' weather conditions this year and widespread frosts hadn't been good for crops.

Cr Yates extended his condolences to the family members of the victims.

A Lockhart resident working at a service station said the deaths would be felt in the small community.

'God yes,' said the woman who declined to be named.

'We're only a tiny little village. We're all so sad.'

A post-mortem will be carried out on the bodies, but it is believed the family suffered gunshot wounds.
