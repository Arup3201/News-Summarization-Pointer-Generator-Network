A woman became an internet sensation after actress Michelle Rodriguez posted a video of her singing at her best friend's wedding online.

Sarah Lane was shocked to discover her rendition of 4 Non Blonde's What's Up had been shared by the star following the Irish nuptials on Saturday.

The 26-year-old  from Pen-y-fai, Bridgend, has been offered singing jobs since clip was shared with the actress's 800,000 followers on Instagram.

Miss Lane was maid of honour at the wedding of Tonya Meli, a celebrity endorser and friend of Rodriguez who has starred in the Fast and Furious, Avatar and Lost. 

After the ceremony and a 'few bottles of wine', the council worker was called up to sing with the band. 

The following day, a video taken by Rodriguez  had been liked by more than 8,000 people. 

'I had no idea,' said Miss Lane. 

We went for brunch on the Sunday and someone said: "You’re on Instagram." I said: "I know I’m on Instagram" as I’ve got an account and they said: "No, you’re actually on Instagram - Michelle put a clip up of you"'. 

'I was summoned to the stage quite late in the night after a few bottles of wine. I’m mortified, I just wish it wasn’t that clip.'

'When I do speak to her she’s got a lot to answer for.

'She was lovely, she’s a good friend of the bride’s.'

The video shows Miss Lane in a beaded bridesmaid dress and flower crown.

Rodriguez accompanied it with the caption: 'I love life people are resilient to life love and the endurance of it all.' 

The video of Miss Lane singing What's Up by 4 Non Blondes has been liked more than 8,000 times online

Michelle Rodriguez shared photographs of the wedding on her Instagram page (left). The actress has been globe-trotting this summer and was seen leaving Ibiza last night after a week of partying 

But the woman, who grew up with the bride in Pen-y-fai, Bridgend, said being photographed or filmed singing was something she wanted to avoid.

'I’m 26. I started getting older, maybe lost my confidence. Social media got bigger and I felt really self-conscious about people taking photos - now look what’s happened.

'I feel completely overwhelmed. I didn’t think that going to a wedding would lead to this. 

'I thought the hard part was walking down the aisle in front of the bride. A couple of people have got in touch and asked if I was interested in doing some gigs.'

The wedding in Kenmare was a first for Rodriguez who posted several joyous photographs of the happy couple online.

Writing beneath one of the bride and groom, she wrote: 'Congrats Tonya and Jared I'm loving Ireland my 1st Irish catholic wedding... May you both find the Joy and Bond most people dream of Love You'.
