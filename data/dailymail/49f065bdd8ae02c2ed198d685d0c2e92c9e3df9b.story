Teresa Giudice may be going to prison on January 5, but once she sheds her orange jumpsuit she's got a job already waiting for her.

The beleaguered Housewife already has a deal to host a cooking show for Bravo and will also appear part-time on the Real Housewives of New Jersey, a show insider reveals exclusively to MailOnline.

Teresa and husband Joe, both 42, pleaded guilty to 41 counts of fraud on March 4, which allegedly saw them net over $5 million in a 10-year period.

Mangia! When Teresa Giudice finishes serving time, she'll be serving up the pasta on her own cooking show

Mama mia: The judge wanted to make sure one parent is with their four daughters, Gia, 13, Gabriella, 10, Milania, 8, and Audrianna, 5, at all times so he allowed Joe to stay home until Teresa gets out

On October 2 Teresa was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison while Joe received a 41-month sentence. And because he is not a U.S. citizen Joe could also be facing deportation back to Italy once his time has been served. 

Joe will report to serve his time after Teresa is released. The judge wanted to make sure one parent is with their four daughters, Gia, 13, Gabriella, 10, Milania, 8, and Audrianna, 5, at all times so he allowed Joe to stay home until Teresa gets out.

'Teresa is, of course, devastated she has to spend even one day behind bars but she has already made this whole situation a money maker for her,' the insider reveals.

According to network insiders, BRAVO knows Teresa has always been a ratings winner for them ever since she flipped a table in the first season of the popular reality series. So it was a no-brainer to have a show ready to go when she gets out of the slammer.

And a cooking show was a natural choice for the Housewife. She could earn about $2million a year.

Teresa has already published three successful cook books that have all been on the New York Times Best Seller list. Skinny Italian, Fabulicious and Fabulicious! Fast & Fit.

'Teresa and BRAVO have been taking this time to plan a big media event when she is released from prison either late next year or early 2016,' the insider continued.

'Teresa has been so popular with the viewers that they know this is going to be an amazing event.

Ingredients

· 3/4 cup low fat ricotta cheese

· 3 tablespoons one percent milk

· 3 tablespoons confectioner's sugar

· 1/4 cup cold brewed French or Italian roast coffee

· 1 tablespoon dark or golden rum

· 8 dry ladyfingers crushed into crumbs 

· 2/3 cup fresh raspberries, or about half of a 6-ounce container

· 1/2 ounce, or 1/2 square, semisweet chocolate

Preparation

Mash the ricotta, milk and 2 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar with a rubber spatula until smooth. Mix the coffee, rum, and remaining tablespoon sugar together in another bowl.

For each serving, put the equivalent of one cookie, or about 2 tablespoons of crumbs, in the bottom of a parfait glass. Sprinkle with a scant 2 teaspoons of the coffee mixture. Top with a scant 2 tablespoons of the ricotta mixture. Repeat with the cookie crumbs, coffee mixture, and ricotta mixture. Cover each with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, which takes at least one hour and up to one day.

Just before serving, top each tiramisù with an equal amount of berries. Using the large holes on a box grater, grate the chocolate onto a sheet of waxed paper. Lift up the waxed paper and use it to help sprinkle the chocolate over the berries. Serve chilled.

'They are going to stay in touch with Teresa while she is in prison by taping phone calls and if possible, they will do jailhouse interviews with her.'

Once she leaves the prison the first person to get an interview will be Andy Cohen on BRAVO, says the insider.

'But aside from her career Teresa is also planning to file for divorce as soon as she gets out of jail and gets back home with her girls and Joe is carted off to do his time.

'Teresa is livid with Joe for putting her in this position so she is fed up and going to send him the divorce papers and tell him to sign them while he is sitting in cell— or else!

'Teresa depended on Joe too much to take care of the family and now she is paying for it!

'She trusted Joe and that's why they got into trouble — he was greedy and did some shady deals to live large.

'This has been a huge wake-up call for Teresa but she is not going to lay down and give up!

'Teresa is determined to make all of this up to her daughters.

'Teresa does not want her kids to suffer because of her — and Joe's — mistakes so she has been working on her life after prison and she is going to be very rich!' 

'Up until now Teresa was just another housewife who loved to cook for her family and lavish her daughters with expensive gifts but now she is planning on being a single mother who has to raise her daughters.

'This is a whole new life for Teresa and she is going to be a force to be reckoned with when she starts over!

'Teresa has a new attitude, she is much wiser and will not trust anyone to take care of her and their daughters again.'

MailOnline reached out to Bravo for comment but has received no response.
