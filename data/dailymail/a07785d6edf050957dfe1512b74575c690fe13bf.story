Regeneration: The park is planned for Barcelona's 'neglected' Olympic venues

In a promotional video for the £16million park, visitors are shown experiencing virtual ski jumping, while donning ski gear in a wind tunnel, as well as being strapped to machines designed to recreate speed swimming in an Olympic-sized pool.

The park will also stage daily awards ceremonies to dole out bronze, silver and gold.

The venture is expected to create at
