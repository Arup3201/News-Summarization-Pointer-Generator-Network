Emotional: The mourners, many in tears, paid tribute to the ex-marine - known as Kosta to his comrades - and threw flowers at his coffin as it passed

Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria

Mr Scurfield's body was flown to Manchester because the People’s Protection Unit (YPG), who he was fighting alongside, has a large base in the city.

The mourners, many in tears, paid tribute to the ex-marine - known as Kosta to his comrades - and threw flowers at his coffin as it passed.

There were shouts of 'martyr' and 'hero' from the crowd, many of whom carried his picture.

His mother Vasliki said she was proud of the her son for standing up for the freedom of Kurdish people in Syria.

'Although he did not die fighting for a British cause he died representing British values,' she said.

Hozen Kasen, a prominent member of PYD in Manchester, added: 'We are very proud that Konstandinos Erik Scurfield went to represent us in a plight that was not his own.

'He is not just a Kurdish hero but a humanitarian hero and will go down in history as such.'

Mark Campbell, a pro-Kurdish rights campaigner who organised the event, told MailOnline: 'The mood was one of great admiration for this man who had fought alongside the Kurdish struggle out in Syria. 

'We wanted to be there to welcome him home and pay our respects. I felt it necessary to acknowledge his return and his sacrifice.

'This is Kosta returning today, but we are seeing funerals every day in Rojava.'

Last week, Mr Scurfield's body was returned to his family at a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border, attended by hundreds of Syrian Kurds.

His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father Chris and uncle.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine

Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine.

He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline.

But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities.

His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said.The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland.

It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. 

Mr Scurfield has been described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East'.

He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults.

Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' 

His family were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. 

The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. 

His family, including his archaeologist parents and student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him.

In a statement following his death, they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.'

Earlier this week, Mr Scurfield's mother told a reception in Parliament: 'Let's stop standing by and let's instead think creatively about grinding down and putting out the biggest threat to the world since the Nazis.

'Kosta was not a mercenary, he wasn't an out of work soldier looking for an adventure or something to do to pass the time.

'And although this is not the way that many of us would have had him choose, it is the way he considered best for him and I'm proud of him for finding the courage to do this.'

Mrs Scurfield urged governments and media across the world to 'shine a spotlight' on ISIS and to name and shame all organisations and states supporting them in any way.

She added: "He was a small drop in an ocean but he has caused big ripples."

Mr Scurfield's body will  be taken to Leicester where a post-mortem examination will be carried out.
