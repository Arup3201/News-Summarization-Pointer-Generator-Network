City life will become a distant memory for a Gold Coast family who will be relocating to their very own private island after signing a 20-year lease for less than $1 million this week.

The new leaseholders of paradise will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island, which is just off the coast of Mackay, north Queensland.

It features three sea shanty-style cottages, a 100,000-litre water supply, a power generator and lots of coconut trees.

The new leaseholders will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island which is just off Mackay - north of Brisbane

A Gold Coast family signed a 20-year lease for less than $1 million this week

'There's not a lot to it, it's quite simple,' Mackay and Marina Real Estate licensee Kim Griffiths told Daily Mail Australia.

A Gold Coast woman, her son and partner will be moving to the 1,100-hectare island. However the residential lease covers about 4 hectares as the rest of the land is a national park.

Mr Griffiths described the couple, in their 60s, as 'quite eccentrically private'.

'They just had the normal reservations in terms of isolation – when living a metropolitan style life you attach yourself to lifestyle habits but I think they're just looking forward to living a simple island life that most fanaticise of us only fantasise about,' he said.

'They're heading towards the island now and they're bringing up a convoy of boats to potter around on and she's going to grow veggies.'

Mr Griffiths said the lease was advertised for $985,000 but could not reveal the final figure.

The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries, most within Australia and New Zealand but also including interests from Europe and Asia

The agent said several people had lived on the island over the last century.

'The bays the only part of island that’s ever been lived on – just the little beach there,' Mr Griffiths said.

'It just the typical idyllic screen saver with palm trees and all.'

The island was originally owned by the Bourke family but the surviving holder of the lease took on some partners and formed a local syndicate of businessmen.

'They used it for family holidays for about 5 or 10 years and then they wanted to go their separate ways and so they put it on the market,' Mr Griffiths said.

The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries which were mostly from Australia and New Zealand but also generated interests from Europe and Asia.

'People inquire because the dreams always there: it reads pretty well, peoples see the photos and think 'wow' – it doesn't get much better cause it's still one of the most beautiful coastal regions of the world,' Mr Griffiths said.

The island was originally marketed for a 12 month lease and about three people inspected the island.
