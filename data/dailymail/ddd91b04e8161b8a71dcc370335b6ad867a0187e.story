With the transfer window set to officially open on July 1, a football club in Bolivia has undoubtedly made the most bizarre signing of the summer.

First division outfit Sport Boys have signed Evo Morales, the Bolivian President, ahead of next season.

The 54-year-old will earn £127 a month and is expected to make his debut for the Santa Cruz-based club in August.

Lives for the game: 54-year-old Morales, pictured during a friendly, will play around 20 minutes of matches

With a busy schedule, Morales, who is a huge football fan, will play around 20 minutes of the games he chooses to play in.

Sports Boys president Mario Cronebold said: 'He loves football and plays well. He'll wear the No 10 shirt.

'We'll send him a list of matches and he'll chose which ones to play in.

'We are contracting a person who is in very good shape and who lives for soccer.

Morales, who plays in midfield, has made a number of appearances in matches with journalists and other presidents while in 2006, he suffered a broken nose following a clash with a goalkeeper.

In 2007, Morales played in a match 6000m above sea level to protest against the national side having to play it's fixtures at such high altitude.

With just one game of the season remaining, Sports Boys currently sit ninth in the division which consists of 12 teams.
