From Ant and Dec's SMTV Live to Tiswas, it would appear the glory days of Saturday morning children's television are behind us.

But now, ITV is hoping to recapture the weekend buzz by launching a new breakfast show.

Scrambled! - which will start at 7.30am on Saturdays and Sundays - is due to be aired late January. 

Popular: Tiswas, featuring Chris Tarrant, became a cult favourite when it hit ITV's airwaves in the 1970s

Mayhem: The show proved popular with both children and adults across the UK, before it was axed in 1982

It will feature chat, games, competitions and a range of established and new children's programmes, according to The Sun.

Viewers will also be encouraged to interact with the show by sending in photos and videos.

Producers are yet to reveal the names of the show's four young presenters - however, they are believed to be two males and two females.

'It is a big deal for ITV. They are hoping to recapture the glory days of Ant and Dec on CD:UK and SMTV Live,' a source told the newspaper.

Successful: SMTV Live, hosted by Ant and Dec and Cat Deeley, has been the channel's most successful children's programme since Tiswas. It attracted a staggering 2.5million viewers at the height of its popularity

The unnamed source added that the 
show - commissioned by CITV - will be shot in a flat in Brighton and is 
expected to air during a two-hour slot.

However, the show has a lot to live up to - with previous Saturday morning programmes attracting more than 2million viewers.

SMTV Live - first broadcast on ITV in 1998 - has been the channel's most successful children's programme since Tiswas. 

The
 show - featuring competitions, cartoons and comedy sketches - attracted
 a staggering 2.5million viewers at the height of its popularity.

Fun: The BBC's Live & Kicking, featuring Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball, was broadcast from 1993 to 2001

Location: Scrambled! - commissioned by CITV - is expected to be filmed in a flat in Brighton (pictured)

It was axed by ITV in 2003 - however, ex-hosts Ant and Dec have recently spoken of their wish to see it return.

Tiswas - believed to be an acronym for Today is Saturday, Watch and Smile - also became a cult favourite when it hit the airwaves in the 1970s.

The show proved popular with both children and adults across the  UK - attracting more than 4million viewers at its peak.

Despite being axed in 1982, it spawned a variety of Tiswas-branded merchandise, including books, t-shirts, CDs and even a ceramic money box.

Other successful Saturday morning shows include Live & Kicking, Swap Shop, Going Live! and Saturday Superstore.
