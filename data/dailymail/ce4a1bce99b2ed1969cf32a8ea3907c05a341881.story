Stuart Lancaster was given an extended contract until 2020 on Wednesday, then told that failure at next year’s World Cup will not be tolerated.

While some questioned the wisdom of making such a long-term commitment to England’s head coach and his assistants, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie was defiant.

‘We want to win the World Cup,’ he said. ‘We are trying to galvanise the England coaching team and do our best to win it. There will be a review at various stages and one of those will be after the World Cup. It will be a very simple review if we win it. Anything less than that, we’ll review afterwards.

2014: March - England again miss out on the Six Nations. October 1 - Lancaster contract extended to 2020 by the RFU

‘Then you get into that delight of what is and is not acceptable below that and what the criteria are, and I’d really rather not go into that.’

Lancaster said: ‘It’s great that the RFU have faith in us as a coaching group and their support has been critical to what we have achieved. While our focus is on the QBE international against New Zealand, and the 2015 World Cup on home soil, we want to build a team that leads into Japan in 2019 and beyond.

‘We believe England Rugby is moving in the right direction, we have the right coaching and management team to take us forward and are excited about the challenge ahead.’

Ritchie admitted that approving contract extensions for Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt at this juncture is a gamble. ‘Of course there are some elements of risk to it,’ he said. ‘But coaching at international level is unique in that the time Stuart and the coaches have with the players is limited and in that regard it requires a special and stable coaching team.

‘We therefore felt it important to secure their long-term future.’

One risk appears to be fudging Lancaster’s remit. While part of his brief is to plan for the medium to long term, as he does so adeptly, the bottom line is the quest for here-and-now victories.

Ritchie said: ‘Of course it’s about results, but it would be short-term if you looked purely at results. You have to look at their contribution in a broader sense; the relationships the guys have with directors of rugby, Premier Rugby, with the community game. Results are extremely important, but there’s more to it than that.’

Lancaster’s England have never beaten South Africa

Lancaster cannot afford to think the same. Despite the breathing space, he must see English success in this season’s Six Nations and next year’s World Cup as a necessity. There have been too many barren years. England are undoubtedly a rising force but whether they can climb fast enough to mount a convincing challenge next year remains to be seen.

First, they must negotiate their way out of a proverbial ‘Group of Death’ containing Australia and Wales. Even if that is achieved, going through as runners-up would surely leave them in the path of South Africa, then the All Blacks, rather than on a less treacherous route to the final.

No matter how difficult the terrain along the way, the world’s richest union have a right to expect a minimum return of a semi-final place in this country, while reaching the final should be a realistic objective.

The doomsday scenario of a pool-stage exit would leave Ritchie and the RFU board facing fierce pressure to consider a management change. 

Ian Ritchie said RFU bosses acted swiftly to secure the long-term future of Lancaster and his coaching group

Ritchie spoke of various objectives: plotting a course for Japan 2019 while continuing the fine work of re-engaging with the rugby public. These are worthy targets, but they are more in tune with a wide-ranging director of rugby role.

Lancaster is committed, resourceful and meticulous, but he should be left to focus on the approaching World Cup. In explaining the timing of this move, Ritchie said that the priority was to show ‘four very talented coaches’ that they are supported and valued, and to ward off potential suitors, should the World Cup reach a glorious conclusion.

There is sense in that, as Rowntree was previously coveted by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and Farrell’s motivational qualities are admired far beyond these shores.

But Lancaster and his assistants are immersed in the English system and their salvage operation after the 2011 World Cup debacle stems from a detailed knowledge of the domestic landscape that would not be an asset overseas. These patriotic men are unlikely to have their heads turned, aside from the prospect of a possible call-up by the Lions. They are doing a good job, but this is still a profound leap of faith by the RFU.

‘We have a belief that we are going to be successful,’ said Ritchie.

He must hope this belief is well-founded to avoid the need for a grim post-mortem examination and regrets.
