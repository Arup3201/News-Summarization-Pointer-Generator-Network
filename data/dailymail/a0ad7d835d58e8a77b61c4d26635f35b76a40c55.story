First came the alleged divorce threats.

And now Matt Lauer's wife has taken to chaperoning him in her latest quest to control his roving eye.

It was reported today that Annette Roque and their there children will be accompanying her husband to London when he travels there next month to report on the 2012 Olympics.

Not only that, but Lauer and his family will stay in a different hotel to the rest of the NBC cast and crew, according to RadarOnline.

Chaperone: Annette Roque is said to be accompanying her husband Matt Lauer to London for the Olympics so she can keep a close eye on him

Co-host: Matt Lauer's wife allegedly said she would divorce him if Natalie Morales, left, took over from Ann Curry as the two were rumored to have had an affair. But Savannah Guthrie, right, took the chair

A source told the website: 'Annette and the kids will all be going to the Olympics so she can keep 
very close tabs on Matt, and he and his family will be staying at a different 
hotel than the rest of the cast and crew.

'Annette generally doesn't like
 to accompany Matt when he travels for work, but it's the Olympics and 
the kids are very excited.

'It's hard to travel with three kids and 
Annette enjoys spending the summer at their Hamptons mansion where they 
live full-time now but Annette has made it very clear the whole family 
will be heading to London. Annette has made no bones about the fact she 
will be keeping close tabs on Matt.'

The news comes just days after it was revealed that Annette allegedly threatened to divorce Lauer if Natalie Morales - who he is accused of having had an affair with - took Ann Curry's co-anchor spot on the Today show.

A source close to Lauer's wife told the The National Enquirer: 'When
 she heard about Ann getting the boot, the first thing she told Matt was
 that she didn't want him cozying up any closer to Natalie.

In her tearful farewell Ann Curry said: 'I did 
not expect to leave this couch after 15 years but I am so grateful, 
especially to everyone who watched. We often call ourselves a family but the viewers are the real family'

Team: Natalie Morales - who is one of the people
 poised to take over from Ann - holds the co-hosts hand as she 
reminisces over her time on the show

'In fact, Annette drew a line in the sand and said if he pushed show bosses to make Natalie his new co-host, she'd divorce him.

'Annette knows Matt is the key to the Today franchise and his bosses will put whoever he wants in the co-host chair.'

Lauer, who is said to have signed a 
$25million deal earlier this year to stay with Today, was accused of 
having an affair with Ms Morales when they were covering the Winter Olympics in Italy in 2006.Â 

Though he denied claims, they were enough to prompt a then-pregnant Annette to file for divorce - which she later withdrew.

However
 two years later, there was speculation Lauer was the father of one of Ms 
Morales' children. She is married to Joe Rhodes and the couple have two 
children together.

Annette lives in the couple's $3.5million house in the Hamptons with their three children. Lauer only sees them at weekends.

Accompanying her husband to the London Olympics will be the second victory for Annette as it was actually Savannah Guthrie who appeared in Ann Curry's place on the Today show this morning, less than 24 hours after the 55-year-old bid a tearful farewell.

Surprise: NBC was due to make an official 
announcement after the show finished, although the appointment was 
widely reported before then

Rumors abounded that Lauer was pivotal in ousting Ann from the seat, believing they 'lacked chemistry'. She was also blamed for the falling ratings which saw ABC's Good Morning America take the lead for the first time in 16 years.

Ann broke down in tears as she said goodbye on this morning's show, apologizing to fans for not being able to 'take the ball all the way to the finish line' but saying she 'tried her best'.

In an interview with USA Today the night before her departure, Ann insisted she was not to blame for the ratings drop.

She said: 'I know I am not to blame for the ratings worries. And my bosses have said to me there are many factors involved. There is no doubt that the rating wars have become meaner and less focused on our responsibilities as journalists.'

Viewers were this morning greeted by the sight of a beaming Guthrie sitting on the sofa instead of Curry, in what felt like a surreal transition as there was no on-air announcement of the changing of the guard.
