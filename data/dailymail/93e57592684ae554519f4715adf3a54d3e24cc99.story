A maths student who started university just three months ago has died of a suspected allergic reaction after a meal in a burger bar.

Shahida Shahid, 18, was taken to intensive care after she collapsed in Manchester city centre on Friday night. She died three days later.

Police have launched a joint investigation with the Food Standards Agency as friends of the teenager said she was 'beautiful, brilliant and kind'.

Meal: Miss Shahid, who started university just three months ago, ate at this branch of trendy burger restaurant Almost Famous in Manchester's Great Northern Warehouse. She then collapsed half a mile away

Miss Shahid, a first-year student at the University of Manchester, collapsed at 8.30pm on Friday after eating in the trendy burger restaurant Almost Famous.

Unlike many allergic reactions, however, Miss Shahid did not suffer from symptoms immediately. 

She and friends ate in the city's Great Northern Warehouse shopping centre and paramedics were only called when they reached The Printworks, another shopping centre half a mile away. 

A  Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At about 8.30pm on Friday, January 9, police were called to Withy Grove in Manchester city centre following reports an 18-year-old woman had collapsed.

'The woman was rushed to hospital but she sadly died on Monday, January 12.

'Initial inquiries have established the woman had been out for a meal in the Northern Quarter prior to her collapse and may have suffered an allergic reaction to her food.

'A joint investigation is currently underway involving Greater Manchester Police and the Food Standards Agency to establish the exact circumstances.'

The 18-year-old grew up in Worsley, Greater Manchester, and attended the local Walkden High School and Winstanley College. 

Her devastated cousin, Farjana Alam, wrote on Facebook the day before Shahida died that she was in intensive care with brain damage.

'Everyone please keep my cousin in your prayers,' she wrote. 'She is in the ICU, has gotten brain damage, and she isn't being responsive - every prayer counts xx.'

Following the death, Farjana posted: 'To God we belong and to God we return. My beautiful, brilliant, kind, loving cousin has passed away.

'Please everyone keep her in your prayers - I still cannot believe she's gone and my heart aches with pain that she has left the world.

'May Allah grant her mercy and take her to the highest of Jannah - everyone please pray for her and her family's strength.'

Others paid tribute to the teenager on social media. 

Sophie Ball wrote on Twitter: 'Rip Shahida, you were such a lovely woman and a great best friend to my cousin - you will be deeply missed. Keep shining.'

Gemma Woodward posted: 'So much to live for. Rip Shahida xxxxx So, so amazing.'

Investigation: The restaurant's management passed on its condolences but said it could not comment further

Another friend, Sophie, wrote: 'So last night I found out that one of my friends was taken off life support few hours ago and sadly passed away. RIP SHAHIDA sadly missed.'  

Just a month ago the FSA launched new EU rules on how customers should be told about allergens in outlets which don't usually label food, such as restaurants and sandwich bars.

Restaurants must now label 14 main substances which can cause an allergic reaction on their menus.

They are gluten, fish, shellfish, egg, peanuts, other nuts, soy beans, milk, celery, mustard, sesame seed, sulphur dioxide, lupin and molluscs.

Marie Carter, company director of Almost Famous, said: 'We're absolutely devastated to hear the tragic news that this young lady has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'As the authorities are conducting investigations it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'
