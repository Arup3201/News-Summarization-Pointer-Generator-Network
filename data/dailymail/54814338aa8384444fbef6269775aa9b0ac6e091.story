A handwritten letter by scientist Francis Crick announcing his discovery of the DNA model to his son has sold at a New York auction for $5.3 million making it the world's most expensive letter.

In the letter dated 19 March 1953 to his 12-year-old son Michael, the British scientist describes his discovery of the structure of DNA as something 'very beautiful,' weeks before it was even made public.

Christie's auction house had previously estimated the letter would fetch only $1 million to $2 million.

Breakthrough: In page one, seen, of British scientist Francis Crick's letter dated 19 March 1953 to his 12-year-old son, he announces his monumental discovery of the structure of DNA

Step-by-step: The father offers his 12-year-old son a step-by-step, easy to read guide to each part of his model here seen composed of sugar and phosphorus

'We have built a model for 
the structure of des-oxy-ribose-nucleic-acid, called DNA for 
short,' he writes of his breakthrough with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins.

'In other words we think we have found the basic copying 
mechanism by which life comes from life.'

It includes a simple sketch of DNA's double helix structure, which he writes underneath: 'the model looks much nicer than this.'

He would go on to win a Nobel Prize for his work, which revolutionized our understanding of genetics.

The seven-page letter, written to his son in boarding school, concludes: 'Read this carefully so that you will understand it. When you come home we will show you the model. Lots of love, Daddy.'

Dr Crick, who died in 2004 at age 88, was awarded the Nobel prize along with Watson and Maurice Wilkins.

Price tag: The letter, which shared his discovery weeks before it was announced to the public, was sold for $5.3 million at auction on Wednesday

Composition: Here, on page four of seven, Dr Crick explains the various orders of each base that make up the model, abbreviated A, G, T and C

First to know: Dr Crick is seen with his son, Michael, whom he wrote the letter to in 1953 while his son was away in boarding school

Topped: The letter by Dr Crick, who is seen back in the day working, easily passed the $3.4million spent in 2008 on a letter written by Abraham Lincoln

The items are among a dozen artifacts Dr Crick's heirs are selling to benefit scientific research.

Half the proceeds from the Christie's sale would benefit the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, where Dr Crick was a professor, the granddaughter said. Twenty percent of the proceeds from the Heritage Auctions sale would go to the new Francis Crick Institute in London, a medical research institute due to open in 2015.

The price was a record for a letter sold at auction, Christie's said, eclipsing an Abraham Lincoln letter that sold in April 2008 for $3.4m including commission.

Other items in the Heritage sale include Dr Crick's
endorsed Nobel prize check in the amount of 85,739,88 Swedish krona, 
dated 10 December 962, and a white lab coat complete with stains and 
wear.

Dr Crick's son, Michael Crick, now 72 and living in 
Seattle, still fondly recalls his father's discovery.

'My father believed that DNA 
contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared 
his enthusiasm with me.

'Everything came together in February 
1953 when my father and Jim Watson were given the 
go-ahead to try and construct a model of DNA.

'My father's enthusiasm could not be 
contained. The story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub 
called the Eagle and announcing to all who would listen that he had 
found “the secret of life”. Then on March 19 my father wrote to me 
describing the model and its implications. I was 12 at the time and away
at Bedales – the British boarding school.

'When I returned to Cambridge my father very proudly showed me the model.

'The excitement of the event was 
beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter 
summarising the discovery in seven simple pages.'

Dr Crick, Watson and Wilkins all won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1962.

Attempting to put his work in simple 
terms, Dr Crick wrote to his son that DNA could be thought of as a 'very
long chain with flat bits sticking out, called the “bases”'.

He said: 
'We have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a 
helix – and the chain, made up of sugar and phosphorus, is on the 
outside and the bases are all on the inside.

'Now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together.'

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life.

Two Cambridge scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, first described its famous double-helix structure in 1953, changing the face of biology for ever.

The complete set of DNA instructions that makes us what we are is known as the Human Genome.

Within it, there are 2.9 billion chemical "letters". Certain sequences of these letters make up the genes, the "software" that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body.

Working out the entire pattern of DNA in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon.

A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder.

The sides of the ladder, made of sugar and phosphate molecules, are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases.

Four different bases are present in DNA, and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code. They are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).

The two DNA strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand, forming base pairs.

Genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs. In the case of the human genome, the figure is 2.9 billion.
