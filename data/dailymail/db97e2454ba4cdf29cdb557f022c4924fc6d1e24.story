A banana tycoon repeatedly refused to call 911 after a woman he gave cocaine to began overdosing in the middle of a wild sex party at a luxurious New York hotel, a cop testified yesterday.

Kimberley Calo, 41, collapsed and began 'frothing at the mouth' after consuming the high-quality cocaine during the three-way romp with Thomas Hoey Jr and his then-mistress Nicole Zobkiw at a plush $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue.

Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'heâ€™d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.'

Victim: Calo, 41, collapsed and died after taking high-quality cocaine at a three-way sex party with Thomas Hoey and his former mistress Nicole Zobkiw

The banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards Calo, a personal trainer, said retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who investigated Calo's 2009 death.

Calo had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw is on trial for making false statements and perjury.

Zobkiw, 29, is accused of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party. Mr Hoey has not been charged.

Boyle, who investigated the death, told the court that Mr Hoey had sex with both women and offered Calo cocaine using his business card, according to the New York Post.

The Post quoted Boyle as saying that Calo began convulsing before 'her head dropped to the table with a thud.

'She was frothing at the mouth. Her eyes rolled back in her head. Her lips started turning blue,' he added.

The court was told Zobkiw 
attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency services but he refused, 
allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine.

She is seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle said.

Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way.

Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night.

But
she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by
a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said.

Scene: The wild sex party took place at a $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Zobkiw ran to the reception desk three times as she tried to get help for Calo

Zobkiw was told she would not get custody of her son if she did not lie, Lato explained.

The conversation was secretly recorded by her boyfriend, according to Lato, who told members of the jury 'your eyes are going to pop out of your head' when it is played.

During opening statements, Manhattan federal prosecutor Margarat Garnett said Zobkiw told a 'string of lies' about the evening.

She is accused of impeding an investigation into Calo's death by denying either woman had sex with Hoey or took cocaine.

Federal agents launched an investigation into Hoey last year but no charges were brought.

The company was founded in 1991 and employs between ten and 20 employees.

According to Cortera business director, Long Island Banana has annual sales figures of under $500,000.

The trial is expected to continue today.
