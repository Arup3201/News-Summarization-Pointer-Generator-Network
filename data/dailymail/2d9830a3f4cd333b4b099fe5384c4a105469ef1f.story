Two Red Bull pilots had a miraculous escape when their planes collided in the sky above the Aero India air show.

Spectators looked on horrified as the pilots from the Czech Republic, known as the ‘Flying Bulls’, crashed while attempting an inverted loop.

The video footage shows three planes in formation before one tails off upwards and away from the others.

The remaining two, beginning their acrobatic manoeuvre, then turn into each other and their wing tips make  contact.

Forced to land, the two pilots were lucky to make it back down to earth without injury.

But the same could not be said for the planes, as both received damage to their respective wing tips.

Near-fatal collision: The heartwrenching moment the pilots collide in the sky as an acrobatic manoeuvre goes horribly wrong

After the accident the air show was stopped for half-an-hour while the runway was checked and cleared of debris before it was allowed to resume.

The near-fatal incident occurred in the air over the Yelahanka Airforce station in Bangalore, which has this week played host to the Aero India show, and has been attended by around 450,000 people.

Regulars to the event, the ‘Flying Bulls’ have performed in earlier editions of Aero India in 2011 and 2013 but it is unlikely that they will make another appearance at this year’s show.
