A cancer-stricken mother has passed away just 12 hours after her three daughters held a last-minute joint wedding so that she could attend.

Sarah, Kaylee and Jodie Swales - aged 19, 21 
and 22 - from Snellville, Georgia learned last week that their mother's breast 
cancer had spread to her liver and there was nothing doctors could do.

The sisters had planned to marry on October 26 but as their mother's condition worsened, they decided to wed on Sunday afternoon to fulfill her final wish of seeing them walk down the aisle.

Bittersweet: Sisters Sarah, Kaylee and Jodie Swales married in a triple wedding on Sunday as they wanted their mother, who had terminal cancer, to see them walk down the aisle. She passed away hours later

Joy: The sisters brought their triple wedding forward after their mother's condition worsened

Surrounded by friends and family, and with their mother Becky and father Otis in the front row, the sisters took turns to marry their fiances as the others watched.

'It's kind of bittersweet,' Jodie Swales told FOX5 before the ceremony. 'We are happy that she's here, but this will probably be the last big thing that we do with her.'

Sarah added: 'It's not like losing a mom, it's like losing a mom and a best friend 
and anyone would want their best friend at their wedding.

'Our wedding wouldn't be the same if she wasn't there to experience 
it with us.'

Together: They said their wedding just wouldn't be the same without their mother Becky, seated

Last wish: Becky, who had wanted to see her girls marry, passed away on Monday - hours after the wedding

Excitement: The women said they were overjoyed that their mother could experience their big days

Otis Swales, who walked all of his daughters down the aisle, said he was hoping his faith would get him through.

'My wife is the love of my life so it's hard,' said Otis, who has been married to Becky for 25 years. 'But I'm proud of my daughters. I just pray God gives me strength to get through every day.'

Just 12 hours after her daughters walked down the aisle, Becky Swales succumbed to the disease.

She had been diagnosed with breast cancer on February 15, 2010 and although chemotherapy proved effective at first, doctors recently discovered that the disease had spread to other organs.

Despite her bleak prognosis, Mrs Swales' daughters say she had continued to maintain a positive attitude until her death.

Battle: Chemotherapy was successful at first but doctors later learned the cancer had spread to other organs

Sadness: Her husband of 25 years, Otis, said Becky was the love of his life and life without her would be hard

'She does always have a smile on her face and she's pushing so hard,' Kaylee said.

Before her death, Becky, 43, wrote on Facenook: 'I thank God for waking me up every day. I have such a great support system.

'My loving husband, my three beautiful daughters and my Mom have stood by me every step of the way. I can't say enough about what a blessing that has been.'

Throughout the wedding planning, support
 and donations had poured in for the family and a company even donated a venue for a reception on October 26, which they said will 
still go ahead.
