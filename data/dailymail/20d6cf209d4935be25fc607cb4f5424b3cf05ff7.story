A teen took a surprise picture with Paul McCartney and Warren Buffett in Nebraska on Sunday night.

In the snap, Tom White stands on a Dundee street as he gives the camera a big grin and flashes a thumbs up as McCartney and Buffett sit behind behind him on a bench.

The musician and the Omaha-based billionaire, who were seen getting dinner together, appear to notice the photo being taken from where they are sitting.

McCartney is currently on tour and will perform at the Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln Monday evening.

'Chillin with my homies': Tom White is seen with 'friends' Paul McCartney and Warren Buffett sitting behind him on a bench in Dundee, Nebraska

A boy identified as Luke Koester by the Huffington Post shared the image on Twitter Sunday night.

He captioned the photo 'Best picture of the night with @WarrenBuffett and @Paul McCartney goes to Tom White!'

That night, Koester also uploaded a photograph of McCartney walking down the street.

'Just saw Paul McCartney in Dundee! My night is awesome!!!!!' he wrote.

However, the encounter didn't go exactly as Koester wished.

'Too bad he couldn't sign my Abby Road vinyl :/' he tweeted.

Sweet treats: McCartney and Buffett were also seen getting dessert after dinner in a local restaurant. McCartney is set to play a concert in Lincoln on Monday

I was here! Jacob Murray, pictured, took the now-famous photo of his friend Tom White

White later shared the same photo online - and described the moment as 'Chillin with my homies.'

McCartney's Twitter account retweeted the image on Monday.Â 

The picture is not technically a selfie, Mashable
 notes, because Koester told the site it was taken by pal Jacob Murray. 
He also shared a photo of himself on Twitter posing in a similar fashion
 to White.

Murray's
 mother Deborah told MailOnline that Jacob and White photographed one 
another standing in front of the Beatle and his dinner companion.

'Paul was very kind and wonderful to the kids,' she said.

Though the boys were photographed with McCartney and Buffett in the background, one fan managed to pose right next with them - on her birthday, no less.

'I can do one better than a selfie! Best bday ever!' Katy Clarke wrote on Twitter.

McCartney and Buffett ate in town at Avoli restaurant and later bought ice cream from eCreamery, Omaha.com reported.

'We had a special dish - gluten-free pasta for Paul ...Sir Paul,' Avoli's owner Dario Schicke told the paper.

A fan at eCreamery, Jeff French, told the paper 'He deserves to be called "Sir" because he's nothing but polite.'
