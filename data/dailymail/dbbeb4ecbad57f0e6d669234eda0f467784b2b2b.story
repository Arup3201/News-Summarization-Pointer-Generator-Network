A Florida woman was so eager to kill some hogs that she left her 9-year-old son and infant daughter alone in her car in frigid 38F weather while she went hunting.

Police have charged Kayla Marie Shavers of New Port Richey with two counts of child neglect after the 9-year-old called 911 on Thursday morning because 'a police car would be warmer.'

Responding officers say they waited 40 minutes for Shavers to emerge from the woods.

Whole hog: Police have charged Kayla Marie Shavers of New Port Richey, Florida with child neglect after she left her children in the car in 38F weather as she went hunting for feral pigs

She was dressed in hunting camouflage.

According to WFTS, Shavers told police she was trying to nab some nuisance hogs that were tearing up her property and felt she'd taken plenty of precautions for her son and baby.

'She said she left the keys for her son to start the car if it got cold. He didn't start the car, he couldn't,' said Corporal Sean Kennedy.

Sheriff Chris Nocco said the 9-year-old may well be a hero.

'He may have saved that 8-month-old baby's life. So kudos to that little 9-year-old boy,' Nocco said.

Meanwhile, his mom faces two charges of child neglect.
