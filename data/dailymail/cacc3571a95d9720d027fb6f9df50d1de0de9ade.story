An American 'billionaire' who claims he wants to buy HMS Ark Royal for £375million is an alleged conman facing up to 20 years in jail.

Mark D. Jones had set up a deal to buy the 600ft aircraft carrier and turn it into a floating hospital to be used on rescue missions at natural disasters.

His scheme would have created hundreds of jobs and won the backing of officials in Belfast where the decommissioned carrier would have undergone a multi million pound re-fit.

Uncertain future: First launched in 1981, HMS Ark Royal may be transformed into an international floating hospital

But far from being a billionaire Jones, 44, is currently in jail in upstate New York awaiting extradition to Las Vegas where he is wanted on fraud charges.

He is wanted for swindling a woman out of more than £100,000 with an investment scheme to aid Native Americans.

British-born Jones, who run as construction company called Stratezyme in Tennessee, has been on the run for over a year after failing to turn up for a court hearing in Las Vegas.

Prosecutors in Las Vegas said Mark D Jones is conman who 'doesn't have a pot to pee in.'

John Kelleher, chief deputy attorney for the fraud division of the Nevada state attorney's office, described him as a 'Walter Mitty' character.

He said Jones had spent the money he allegedly stole on 'strippers and luxury hotels'.

Jones is due in court in the town of Lockport, near Niagara Falls, for a hearing on his extradition to Las Vegas.

The 22,000-ton Invincible Class carrier, launched in 1981, was controversially put up for sale online after it was axed by the Government in 2010’s defence review.

Plans for it had included selling it for scrap, turning it into a nightclub or sinking it for use as a diving wreck.

Jones's idea would have involved sailing the ship from its mooring in Portsmouth to Belfast where it would undergo a massive overhaul for use as a hospital.

It would also be fitted with a desalination plant so it could be deployed in areas struck by water-borne diseases and transform seawater into safe drinking water.

The vessel would also carry building machinery to assist reconstruction in disaster zones.
