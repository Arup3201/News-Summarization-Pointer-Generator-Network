A new study has found women who drink three sugary drinks a week increase their risk of suffering breast cancer

Women who have more than three sugary drinks a week may have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, a study has found.

Researchers found that the more sugary drinks consumed by the women in their study, the greater the density of their breasts - a known risk factor for cancer.

Dense breasts have less fatty tissue and more of the gland tissue that makes and drains milk as well as supportive tissue that surrounds the gland.

Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.

Their cancers are also more likely to be missed because any areas of abnormal tissue are harder to spot during mammogram screening.

Lead author of the study, Dr Caroline Diorio from Laval University in Quebec, said: ‘We know that worldwide consumption of sugar has increased and the findings of this study show what effect that type of diet could have on breast density, one of the strongest indicators for breast cancer risk.’

For the study, 1,555 women - half of whom were pre-menopausal and half of whom were postmenopausal - answered a questionnaire about how often they drank sugar-sweetened fruit juice and fizzy drinks. A serving was 355ml, about the size of a normal can of fizzy drink.

Their breast density was then measured through mammogram screening.

Dr Diorio said: ‘Among all women, those who had a sugary drink intake of more than three servings per week had a mean of 29.6 per cent in breast density but those who did not drink this type of drink had a mean of 26.2 per cent in breast density.

‘An increase of about three per cent in breast density is not negligible in terms of breast cancer risk.

‘By comparison it has been shown that healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer who received (the breast cancer drug) tamoxifen for four-and-a-half years had a reduction of 6.4 per cent in breast density, and it has been observed that tamoxifen can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 30-50 per cent in high-risk women.’

Experts believe sugar can enhance cell growth, and therefore the density of breast tissue. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous

It’s thought that sugar can enhance cell growth, and therefore, density in breast tissue.

Dr Diorio concluded: ‘Considering the worldwide increase in sugar consumption and all the health problems it is related to, it is important to continue research on this subject and begin to inform the public about the adverse effects of sugar consumption.’

The study was published in the journal BMC Public Health.

A new piece of research at the University of Illinois has found IVF drugs do not cause breast or gynecological cancers

Fertility drugs do not trigger cancer in women trying to get pregnant, says new research.

A US study of almost 10,000 women suggests hormonal drugs and other medication do not raise the overall risk of breast, ovarian and womb cancers.

The exception is women who remained childless despite having drugs called gonadotrophins as part of IVF treatment.

But experts believe the extra risk is caused by underlying health problems responsible for the infertility.

Debate has raged about whether IVF drugs may cause cancer because they stimulate hormones linked to the disease, especially breast cancer.

A new study looked back at 9,892 women treated for infertility between 1965 and 1988 at five US centres, and followed them for 30 years for data on cancer.

Altogether 749 breast cancers, 119 womb cancers and 85 ovarian cancers were found.

Using a popular fertility drug called clomiphene was not linked with breast, womb or ovarian cancers.

A small number of women treated with the drug for at least a year had a 69 per cent higher risk of breast cancer, but only 31 women fell into this category.

Experts said current guidelines recommended just three to six months of treatment.

Dr Bert Scoccia from the University of Illinois, Chicago, presented the data today at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich.

He said the results were ‘generally reassuring’.

There was a higher cancer risk for women treated with newer fertility hormones known as gonadotrophins who remained childless.

But, said Dr Scoccia, only 13 women were in this category and it was likely the increased risk was caused by their severe infertility ‘rather than that of drug usage.’

Richard Kennedy general secretary of the International Federation of Fertility Societies, said ‘Cancer risks of drugs used to stimulate egg production have been evaluated in a number of national studies and not found to significantly increase the risk, other than that which relates to the underlying risks in this patient group.

‘This study does not change the current recommendation to patients that the risks are low but that clomiphene should generally not be used for more than 12 cycles.’

The study based on 30 years of research found 'little evidence' women treated using conventional fertility hormones for ovarian stimulation increased the long-term risk of breast and gynecological cancers. Pictured is breast cancer cells under the microscope
