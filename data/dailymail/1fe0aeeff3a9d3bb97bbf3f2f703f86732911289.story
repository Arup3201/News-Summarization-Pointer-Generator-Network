A woman has exacted the ultimate revenge on her roommate after she wrapped every item in his bathroom with cling wrap and aluminium foil.

Shari Griffin, who lives in Darwin, was getting her roommate named Chris back for parking horizontally across both car spaces in their apartment block as a prank.

'I came on a Sunday night at 9.30pm and... at the time I had to do a 50-point turn and go back down three storeys and park on the road. I was pissed off,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The 24-year-old lives in Darwin in the Northern Territory posted a video of the prank on her Facebook page

So the Northern Territory woman, 24, hatched her own hilarious plan, which took between half an hour to an hour to complete, and posted a video of her efforts on Facebook. 

In the footage, Ms Griffin showed off how she had wrapped every from the toilet to the basin to skincare products in her housemate's bathroom with cling wrap and aluminium foil.

It has garnered just over 2,000 views so far on the social media site. 

Ms Griffin said she had seen someone else had carried out a similar prank on social media and had found it funny.

It took her between half an hour and an hour to complete her prank, which included wrapping the toilet (left) and toilet paper (right) 

When her housemate came home, much to her frustration, he pretended like nothing was wrong.

'At first he was walked in and said "This is the way I left it",' Ms Griffin said.

'He acted like it didn't even bother him because he knew it would p*** me off. 

When her housemate came home, he pretended not to notice because he knew it would annoy her

'He was joking around saying "Why wouldn't I put tinfoil on the sunscreen?" and "Why wouldn't I put cling wrap on the shower head?" It was funny.'

Ms Griffin said she and her housemate 'get along like brother and sister' and she expected retaliation.

'It's like a war zone at home. Every time I come home I'm being really cautious about what I touch. I know he'll get me back,' she said.
