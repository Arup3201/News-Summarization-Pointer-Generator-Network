Right to remain silent? Four Republican lawmakers want to classify bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, an 'enemy combatant'

Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not be read his Miranda rights – but a battle is being waged whether he should.

Four prominent Republican Congressmen have argued that the 19-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen should be treated as an ‘enemy combatant,’ meaning that he would not be Mirandized. 

Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, as well as Rep. Peter King, New York, said in a joint statement they ‘do not want this suspect to remain silent.’

In a statement obtained by the Washington Post, the four Republican lawmakers wrote: ‘The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.’

Officials said late Friday after Tsarnaev was detained that they would use a public safety exemption to delay the suspect’s Miranda rights.

However, the exemption expires 48 hours after the arrest, so quick actions must be taken.

According to authorities, the suspected bomber remains at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in critical but stable condition. Eleven of the bombing victims are still being treated only doors away.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said today that Tsarnaev is likely unable to communicate, but hopes the suspect comes around 'because we have a million questions.' 

The reading of a suspect’s Miranda rights alerts a person of their right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to a fair and speedy trial.

The Congressmen wrote that alerting Tsarnaev of his rights as a naturalized U.S. citizen shouldn’t be anything near a priority.

‘We should be focused on gathering intelligence from this suspect right now that can help our nation understand how this attack occurred and what may follow in the future.’

The lawmakers then challenged the Obama administration to consider the ‘enemy combatant’ option, saying: ‘We continue to face threats from radical Islamists in small cells and large groups throughout the world,’ saying their primary goals were ‘killing as many Americans as possible, preferably within the United States.’

Federal public defender Miriam Conrad, who represents Massachusetts, told FoxNews.com that her office will likely represent Tsarnaev following his charges.

The debate over denying the suspect his Miranda rights has sparked outrage in the American Civil Liberties Union. The organization said Saturday that denying Tsarnaev his rights is ‘un-American.’

Anthony D. Romero, ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement today: ‘Every criminal defendant is entitled to be read Miranda rights. The public safety exception should be read narrowly.

‘It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule. Additionally, every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel.

‘We must not waver from our tried-and-true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.’

According to FoxNews.com, the Obama 
administration’s Department of Justice is weighing its options and could
seek the death penalty.

As  Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald notes, the Obama administration 
pushed back Miranda rights in 2010, limiting the rights for terrorists 
arrested on U.S. soil to be Mirandized. 

Slate’s
Emily Bazelon also looked at the examples of other terrorism suspects, 
including the Christmas Day 2009 ‘underwear’ bomber, Umar Farouk 
Abdulmutalab, who was only Mirandized after 50 minutes of interrogation.

Then, Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shazad was arrested in 2010 for trying to bomb the New York City neighborhood. In both cases, Bazelon notes, the FBI said they received valuable information from invoking the public safety exception.

But, she writes: ‘Because no one is crying over the rights of the young man who is accused of killing innocent people, helping his brother set off bombs that were loaded to maim, and terroriz(e) Boston Thursday night and Friday.

‘But the next time you read about an abusive interrogation, or a wrongful conviction that resulted from a false confession, thing about why we have Miranda in the first place. It’s to stop law enforcement authorities from committing abuses.’
