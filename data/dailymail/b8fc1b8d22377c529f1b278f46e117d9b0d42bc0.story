Brisbane mother Kellie van Meurs has died after suffering a heart attack while receiving a stem cell treatment in Moscow

A Brisbane mother-of-two has passed away from an apparent heart attack while receiving controversial stem cell therapy in Russia which remains unapproved in Australia.

Kellie van Meurs traveled to Moscow in June to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for her neurological disorder, Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS), a rare disease which causes muscle spasms.

Family and friends of the mother have said it was not the controversial treatment that killed her on July 19, but rather that the treatment was her last hope to live a pain free life.

Mrs van Meurs was inspired to undertake HSCT after hearing of the success story of Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Kristy Cruise, who she soon became very close friends with.

Ms Cruise underwent the same procedure last year to treat her own condition. The treatment involves intense chemotherapy and the patient's own stem cells being drawn out of the blood stream before being transplanted back, in an effort to 're-grow' their immune system from scratch.

While the exact reason for her death remains unclear, Ms van Meurs' family remains satisfied that the hospital in Moscow gave Mrs van Meurs the best care possible.

'Kellie was in great pain. Her treatments here gave her limited quality of life. She wanted the chance to be free of the shackles of SPS and enjoy a normal life as a Mum and wife,' Kristy Cruise told Daily Mail Australia.

Mrs van Meurs's family do not believe she died from the hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), which she was receiving in an attempt to treat her neurological disorder, Stiff Person Syndrome

'It is my belief the result may well have been the same if she had been treated with HSCT in Australia.'

Ms Cruise said that Mrs van Meurs had applied for HSCT in Australia, but that she grew desperate for treatment as the wait for approval continued and her health deteriorated.

'The key thing is that her doctors here said that they would try and do a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but it was all held up in red tape and she just couldn't wait, so we need to get a move on and get this happening in Australia,' Ms Cruise said.

'It is currently in extremely limited trials in Sydney, with very few patients who meet strict criteria being accepted. HSCT is currently performed for MS in over a dozen first-world countries. The Australian healthcare system is too conservative and the funding for clinical trials is too limited. 

Kristy Cruise, a close friend of Mrs van Meurs who received the same treatment to treat her Multiple Sclerosis, said Kellie's health was deteriorating as she waited for the procedure to be approved for her in Australia

'The FDA has been trialling this treatment for over a decade and FDA approval is expected in 2022.  When will Australia catch up with the rest of the world?'

Both Ms Cruise and Mrs van Meurs received HSCT in the Pirogov National Medical Surgical Centre in Moscow, which currently has a waiting list of over two thousand people from around the world, according to Dr Denis Fedorenko.

Nine Australians are currently being treated by the hospital as 300 more await their turn.

The Moscow hospital where Ms van Meurs (pictured) was being treated, currently had a waiting list of 300 other Australians hoping to undergo the treatment which is not approved in Australia

'The demand for pro-active, clinically-researched treatments for MS is massive. Current successful applicants are being given dates in 2016,' Ms Cruise, who is currently assisting 80 Australians seeking HSCT from the Pirogov hospital, said.

'Patients are sick of being told that this is a "liveable" disease. Those who seek HSCT feel their current quality of life and the negative outlook for their health outweighs the small risk associated with this treatment.'

The demand is so high however, that the hospital was recently forced to delayed a number of treatment dates for approved Australian patients.

Ms Cruise has set up a fundraising page to help Mrs van Meurs' family pay for her funeral costs.
