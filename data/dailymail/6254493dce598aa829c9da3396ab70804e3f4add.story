A New York TV reporter covering this week's blizzard was very nearly injured on the job, but it wasn't the dangerous elements that could have done her in.

it was a car skidding out of control.

What's more, the driver who came so close to smashing into Stacey Bell did so in a live NBC 4 New York shot.

Watch the car behind her: NBC News 4 New York reporter was nearly hit by a car during a live shot Monday near a snowy New York street

The perilously close call came just as Bell was ending her segment.

She was reporting from a nearly deserted, snow-covered New York street when three cars came to a stop at a red light.

As the cars prepared to make a turn in Bell's direction, one of them revs the engine.

Bell carries on calmly, without evening looking behind her.

Shocking: As Bell spoke into the camera, a car behind her revved its engine then spun wildly around a corner

Unfazed: The car came dangerously close to Bell, who never looked in the direction of the noise vehicle

Meanwhile, over her shoulder, the revved up driver's turn went so wide that his car came shockingly close to taking out Bell.

The car than drives away and out of the shot. 

The super professional Bell didn't even flinch, though she must have known something was up by the noise coming from the car,  but the in-studio anchors did.

'Not sure if that was a little sliding or spinning or intentional,' said one of the shocked anchors. 

Suspicious: While she couldn't see it, the in-studio anchors commented that the car's spinout looked suspiciously purposeful

Viewers and even her anchors in the studio wondered if the driver in NBC 4 New York reporter Stacey Bell's shot skidded on purpose
