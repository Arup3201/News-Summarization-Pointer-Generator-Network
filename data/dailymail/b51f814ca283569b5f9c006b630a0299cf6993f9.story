A fascinating letter by astronaut Neil Armstrong prior to his historic moon landing in which he contemplated the words he would speak if the mission was successful has been unearthed.

The letter was sent to a fan a month before Armstrong became the first person ever to walk on the surface of the moon on July 21, 1969.

Millions watched live on television as he took his first steps and famously declared the mission was 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'.

The amazing letter was written by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin just weeks before the moon mission

The words are among the most celebrated of all time and helped secure Armstrong's place in the history books.

Fittingly, in his letter to Hawaiian supporter Mrs A. O. Teller on June 23, 1969, Armstrong revealed he hadn't decided on what he would say should the Apollo 11 moon landing go to plan but hoped she would be 'pleased with whatever message we do have'.

Armstrong said: 'Colonel Aldrin and I appreciate your taking the time to write us for your suggestion on a message from the lunar surface.

'We do not know at this time what our inclination will be should we be successful in our landing attempt.

'I certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have and the impressions that people on earth receive from our efforts.'

The letter, on NASA-headed notepaper and signed by both Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, has sold for almost $24,000 at a sale held by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts.

A spokesman from RR Auction said: 'This amazing letter pertains to one of the most historically significant broadcasts of all time-the first words sent to Earth from another world.

'Even before Armstrong, Aldrin, and Michael Collins would lift off for the moon on Apollo 11, people wondered what those words might be.

'With the danger and uncertainty that swirled around the historic NASA mission, its success was more important to Armstrong and the crew than what words would be uttered.

'As Armstrong noted here, "We do not know at this time what our inclination will be should we be successful in our landing attempt. I certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have."

'He later explained that following a train of thought that he had had after launch and during six hours and 40 minute after landing, he developed the now famous line, "That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."

'This is the only correspondence we have seen between Armstrong and Aldrin and someone outside of NASA regarding one of the most historic and familiar quotes of modern times.'

Astronaut Michael Collins remained on board the Columbia mother ship while the others went to the moon 

The trio took off from the Kennedy Space Center  in Florida on July 16, 1969 at the start of their moon mission
