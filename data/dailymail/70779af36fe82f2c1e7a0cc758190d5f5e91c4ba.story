Ireland will ask the European Court of Human Rights to reopen a landmark case against Britain over the use of alleged torture in Northern Ireland.

On the back of new evidence, Amnesty International and other human rights organisations pressed Dublin to relaunch proceedings in the so-called 'Hooded Men' case.

They were 14 Catholic men interned - detained indefinitely without trial - in 1971 who claimed they were subjected to a number of torture methods.

These included five techniques, hooding, stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and water, along with beatings and death threats.

The men were hooded and flown by helicopter to a secret location, later revealed as a British Army camp at Ballykelly, outside Londonderry. None were ever convicted.

A documentary on Irish State broadcaster RTE in June disclosed fresh evidence that the British Government authorised the 'deep interrogation' tactics at the highest levels.

Confirming Ireland's approach to Europe, Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said the fresh evidence was taken very seriously by Dublin and legal advice was also sought.

'On the basis of the new material uncovered, it will be contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the Hooded Men should be recognised as torture,' he said.

The men say they were forced to stand in 'stress positions', as demonstrated by these Amnesty International campaigners in this file picture, for long periods of time by their British captors

'The Government's decision was not taken lightly.

'As EU partners, UK and Ireland have worked together to promote human rights in many forms and during the original case, the UK did not contest before the European Court of Human Rights that a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human rights took place.

'The British and Irish governments have both worked hard to build stronger more trusting relations in recent years and I believe that this relationship will now stand to us as we work through the serious matters raised by these cases which have come to light in recent months.' 

The Irish government first took a human rights case against Britain over the alleged torture in 1971.

The European Commission ruled that the mistreatment of the men was torture, but in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights held that the men suffered inhumane and degrading treatment that was not torture.

The UK did not dispute the finding.

The men were taken to a British Army camp at Ballykelly, outside Londonderry

The new evidence, uncovered from national archives in London by the human rights outfit The Pat Finucane Centre, throws doubt over the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.

It includes a letter dated 1977 from then-home secretary Merlyn Rees to then-prime minister James Callaghan in which he states his view that the decision to use 'methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971/72 was taken by ministers - in particular Lord Carrington, then secretary of state for defence'.

Mr Rees added that 'a political decision was taken'.

The Irish government had until December 4 - six months after the new evidence came to light - to inform Europe if it wanted the case reopened.

A High Court case was launched in Dublin seeking to compel the Cabinet into acting.

Amnesty International said the reopening of the case would help the surviving 'Hooded Men' and the families of those who have died to their right to truth and justice

'The UK withheld from the European Court what it knew about the terrible suffering deliberately inflicted on them and its being sanctioned at the highest levels of the UK Government,' said spokesman Colm O'Gorman.

'Ireland's decision today bravely flies the flag for human rights and the universal and unconditional prohibition of torture.'

Liam Shannon, one of the 14 men, said they were absolutely delighted.

'We've waited 43 years and we want to thank everyone involved, our legal team and all the researchers who turned up the relevant information in order that we could make a case and we'd particularly like to thank Amnesty International for their assistance,' he added.

Paul O'Connor, of The Pat Finucane Centre, said three successive British governments had deliberately deceived the European court over the case, which has since been used to justify techniques in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo.

'The recently discovered documents show the British government withheld vital medical, legal and policy documents from both the European Court and the Irish government in respect of the case taken by the Irish state on torture,' he added.
