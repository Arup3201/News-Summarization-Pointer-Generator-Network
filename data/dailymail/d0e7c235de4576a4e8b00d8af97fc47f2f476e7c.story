The chances of a ewe giving birth to five lambs is a million to one but brothers Robert and Andrew Mackintosh have beaten the odds for the second year in a row.

A ewe at their farm in Glengolly in the Highlands gave birth to the rare set of quintuplets last week and both mother and babies are doing well.

Andrew, 41, who helped make the special delivery, said he was stunned to see five lambs pop out - especially after another of their ewes gave birth to quintuplets during the lambing season last year.

Against the odds: This ewe at a farm in the Scottish Highlands had five normal-sized healthy offspring -  a million-to-one chance

And despite the unusual pregnancy he said the labour was one of the easiest there has been at the farm this year.

'Despite the ewe giving birth to five lambs, it was a straightforward labour,' he said.

'The lambs came out of the mother one straight after the other without any difficulty. There were also no health problems with any of the lambs and, despite being quintuplets, they are all regular size.

'You rarely see a ewe giving birth to quadruplets, so to have it happen second year running is a complete surprise.'

Last year, Andrew and Robert, 46 allowed all five lambs to stay with their mother, a cross Lleyn breed, for two days before the brothers gave two of them to other ewes, to give the lambs a better chance of growing up stronger.

Simple: The birth was surprisingly straightforward, according to the farmer. Pictured with the five lambs are (left to right) James, Ally and John Mackintosh

'They were kept together for a couple of days but it wouldn't be fair on the ewe or the five lambs to be all kept together,' said Andrew.

'It would put too much pressure on the ewe and the lambs would not get the milk they required.

'To relieve stress on the mother, two of the five lambs were given to other ewes and it has worked great for all of them.'

The brothers, who began their lambing season on April 13, have so far seen 680 ewes give birth, with just another 40 to go.

As well as attending to expectant ewes, Andrew and Robert are also in the process of calving.

After spending several days inside the barn, all five lambs have now been put out to graze.

Bounding along in the green fields of the Highlands behind their proud mother, the lambs have all now been put out to pasture.
