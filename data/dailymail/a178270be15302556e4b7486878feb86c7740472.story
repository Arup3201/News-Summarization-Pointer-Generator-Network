Joshua Saunders, who authorities said was driving while under the influence, was attempting to back out of the driveway of a Gainesville, Georgia home when Martin ran behind the car (above the 1978 Chevrolet K10 he was driving)

Georgia State Patrol said following the accident, Joshua Saunders got out the car and saw what happened but left the scene. 

He was then spotted less than a mile from where the incident occurred by a Hall County sheriff's deputy and was taken back to the scene.

'He was standing right there playing and Josh went to back up and Josh jumped out of the truck and started screaming, 'Landen! Landen!' Martin's grandmother and Joshua Saunders' mother, Martha Saunders told Channel 2.

'He didn't mean to hit that baby. He didn't. He loved him.'

Martin and Joshua Saunders' family said the teen was not aware that the child had run into the path of the Chevrolet he was driving at the time.

'It was an accident and accidents happen,' the toddler's mother, Kristian Saunders, told CBS 46. 

Joshua Saunders was extremely remorseful and was also cooperative with authorities, according to investigators.

The family has said that they do not want Joshua Saunders to be put behind bars, and he is currently being held at the Hall County Jail.

'He loved his uncle Josh,' Smith told CBS. 'We want to roll back time, we want to roll back a day.' 

Allen said that toxicology tests on Joshua Saunders' blood-alcohol content are pending.
