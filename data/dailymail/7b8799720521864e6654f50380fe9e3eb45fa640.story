'Firearms, ammunition, firearm parts and realistic replicas of firearms are always prohibited in carry-on baggage,' a statement from the Transport Security Administration (TSA), released to KIRO 7, said.

'However, these items can be transported in checked baggage provided the traveler declares them to the airline during the ticket counter check-in process.'

Russell had a permit for the gun but did not declare the weapon during check-in.

His background check was clear and he was released, an airport spokesman said.

Firearms in checked baggage must be unloaded and stored in a locked, hard-sided container.

Russell now faces a fine of up to $7,500 in addition to facing local or state criminal charges.

The TSA recommends civil penalty charges ranging from $3,000 to $7,500 on a case-by-case basis.
