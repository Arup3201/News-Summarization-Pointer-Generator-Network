The United States has delivered 10 armoured but unarmed Humvees as part of its $75 million non-lethal military aid deal to Ukraine. 

Over the next month, a total of 230 of the vehicles is due to arrive in the troubled region to help Ukrainian forces prepare against further attacks from Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. 

The U.S. has already sent Ukrainian forces high-tech night-vision goggles, surveillance drones and secure communications systems as part of their commitment.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said: 'I have just personally seen - having been behind the wheel of the Humvee - that it is an extremely effective, extremely powerful, extremely good military vehicle which Ukrainian air forces, Ukrainian special divisions, the Ukrainian army are waiting for today.'

He told Ukraine Today: 'And I as the president of Ukraine, as commander-in-chief, on behalf of the Ukrainian people, would like to thank to the United States of America for its comprehensive and firm position regarding the resolution of the conflict in the Donbass, for recognising Russia as an aggressor which annexed Crimea and which launched direct military aggression in particular areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.'

So far, President Barack Obama has decided against equipping Ukraine with offensive military equipment, although the armoured Humvee vehicles donated to Ukraine have turrets which can be easily fitted with heavy machine guns. 

Fighting in the region has abated although there are some skirmishes still being reported. 

Although, President Obama has deployed A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft to Powidz airbase in western Poland.

The four tank-killing aircraft are involved in a number of training missions until the weekend.

Meanwhile, EU leaders will hold a summit with President Poroshenko in Kiev about the status of the Minsk ceasefire agreement.

Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Yevhen Perebiynis said: 'We expect that the EU-Ukraine summit will take place on April 27.'

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk are expected to attend, as well as EU heads of state and government who wish to go, EU officials added.

Trade issues will likely also be on the agenda, the officials said.

The summit will be a chance for Poroshenko, who attended an EU summit in Brussels in February, to brief leaders on whether the Ukraine ceasefire deal is fully working and to shape the EU's decision on whether to extend or lift sanctions on Russia.

EU leaders agreed last week that economic sanctions imposed on Russia will stay in place until a Ukraine peace deal is fully implemented, effectively extending them to the end of the year if need be.

But they will still have to take a formal decision later on whether to extend economic sanctions on Russia expiring in July.

Russia has always denied assertions by Ukraine, backed by the United States and the European Union, that it has been sending arms and troops across the border to support the pro-Moscow separatists.

Despite the reduction in violence, innocent civilians are still being killed and injured as a result of the conflict. 

Three people were killed and six were injured after the bus they were travelling in struck a landmine in eastern Ukraine. The bus had been in the process of crossing from government to rebel-held territory. 

A local police official, Ilya Kyva, said the bus had been carrying about 20 passengers from Artemivsk, a government-held town north of the region's main city of Donetsk, to Horlivka, which is held by the separatists, about 22 miles away.

The bus struck the land mine as it apparently tried to negotiate around a road block manned by government forces, Interfax quoted Kyva as saying.

Kyva said the six injured people were 'in a serious condition'.

So far, more than 6,000 people have died in the conflict which erupted last April.
