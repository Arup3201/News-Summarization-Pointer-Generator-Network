A one-bedroom Mayfair flat has been let in a record-breaking 40 minutes after the successful new tenant paid £10,000 up-front to secure it.

The stampede for the 301 sq ft central London home, which is only slightly larger than a garage, was so intense that the 'winning' tenant paid more than six months rent in advance.

Within 15 minutes of uploading the flat to its website with an asking price of £1,560 per month, letting specialists E J Harris was bombarded with more than 200 email and telephone enquiries.

During the first 30 minutes, there were five serious offers made on the property, which is located just off Regent Street.

And 10 minutes later the flat was let to an executive working in the hospitality industry in the West End.

Boasting one-bedroom, a shower room and a small living area which leads into a compact open plan kitchen dining area, the flat was described as 'compact and bijou'. 

Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, described the deal as 'extraordinary'.

She said: 'If it was a swanky flat in Mayfair's posh Western district I would expect it to fly out of the door, but this is an 'ordinary Londoner' apartment on the eastern Soho border by Regent Street.

For around the same price, you could rent a stunning four-bedroom country home in Somerset or a two-bedroom flat with garden in Wimbledon

'The speed of this deal and the battle to secure the tenancy is the clearest indicator yet to me how buoyant and hot London's letting market is at present.

'It is the ordinary nature of this that makes it so extraordinary.'

For around the same price, you could rent a stunning four-bedroom country home in Somerset or a two-bedroom flat with garden in Wimbledon.

But the desirability of renting a property in Mayfair, albeit on the Soho border, rather than buying before the General Election, created a 'perfect storm' for the flat.
