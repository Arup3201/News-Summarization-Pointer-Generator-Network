The surgery that allowed Mark Cahill to once again use his hand was hailed as a landmark moment in British healthcare.

But since being given a new lease after Britain's first ever hand transplant, a simple thought has been crossing the 51-year-old's mind - where his new hand came from.

The former pub landlord will never know who donated the limb for data protection reasons but as he recovers in Leeds Royal Infirmary he said he 'appreciates the gift he has given me'.

Life changing: Mark Cahill, pictured with wife Sylvia, underwent the first hand transplant on Boxing Day

Revealing that he and wife Sylvia are
receiving counselling to ensure they don't reject the hand, Mr Cahill 
said: 'Obviously the thought goes through your mind who the donor is.

'You think about what the hand has done, where it has been.'

Mr Cahill, from Greetland, West 
Yorkshire, lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – 
when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he 
had suffered for 20 years.

He said that every morning his first thought is now 'there's my new hand', describing the feeling as 'such a novelty'.

In an interview with The Sun, Mr 
Cahill described his emotional farewell to his hand, saying 'goodbye' to
it before the landmark operation.

He described being 'ecstatic' 
following the eight-hour procedure as he caught a glimpse of his new 
fingers, even being able to move them slightly.

Mr Cahill revealed that he will have 
to take 'anti-rejection drugs' for the rest of his life to ensure that 
his body accepts the new hand.

He also had to undertake psychological evaluations and IQ tests before and after the operation.

One of the things he is most looking 
forward to is being able to once again shake people's hand, describing 
previous scenarios as 'embarrassing'.

Following the operation, Mr Cahill said that his next
milestone was to be able to hold his three-year-old grandson’s hand for 
the first time.

After losing the use of his right hand five years ago, he said the implications
of his surgery were still sinking in.

As he continued to marvel at being 
able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand, he said he hoped to regain 
his independence and enjoy family life to the full.

Speaking of his grandson Thomas, he said: ‘Anything I can do will be a bonus. Holding his hand is going to be great.’

‘I had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand,’ he said.

He and Sylvia, 47, had to 
leave their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn near Halifax, and he has
been unable to work since.

‘It made it virtually impossible to do
anything,’ he said. ‘My wife had to help me dress and cut my food up. 
You can imagine without any hands it’s very difficult.

And Sylvia spoke of looking forward to holding her husband's hand for the first time in five years. She admitted it will be strange holding a stranger's hand but is still excited.

A friend said how so far, 
for all of Thomas’s life, Mr Cahill has had to settle for ‘just 
observing’ the little boy, rather than be able to play with him. ‘He’s 
the apple of his eye,’ the friend added.

Mr Cahill’s operation 
became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same 
procedure.

While there have been 70 hand transplants world-wide, in 
those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery.

The surgeon who carried out the 
transplant previously praised the donor’s family for bringing about good
from the ‘awful tragedy of a loved one’.

Professor Simon Kay, who led the 
complex procedure at Leeds General Infirmary, said their permission had 
to be sought soon after their relative’s sudden death on Boxing Day.

There is no tick box for ‘limbs’ on donor register forms so next-of-kin must be consulted ‘individually by the hospital’.

The plastic surgeon said: ‘I really 
think we have to acknowledge the circumstances that this hand was given,
at Boxing Day, at a time of enormous tragedy and loss. I would like to 
acknowledge the extraordinary gift.

‘Organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one.’

It is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke.

Professor Kay said it could 
be 18 months before the operation is considered a success.

‘If all goes 
well, I would hope he has quite strong grasp, and have good sensibility,
a good ability to feel, and he’ll have a precision pinch,’ he said.
