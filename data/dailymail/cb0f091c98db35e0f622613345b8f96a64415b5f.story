Harvard might be known internationally for its academic prowess, but it is gaining attention for advocating a healthy approach to women’s bodies too.

A photo project, called 'Rugged Grace’ done by the Harvard Women's Rugby team exploring what sport and community mean for their bodies and identities has become an online hit.

Featuring members of the team dressed in simple grey shorts and sports bras, they write on their own bodies, and those of their teammates, the things that they admire or appreciate.

The inspiring project sees the women with words like 'powerful' and 'big heart' written across their bodies

The team wrote what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body

The project also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team

The group say that rugby 'necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful'

The team say that their sport helps their positive body image. 'Rugby is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training'

The Harvard team pride themselves in the strength and power of their bodies on the pitch

The uplifting photos see the girls covered in affirming words like ‘strong’, ‘open heart’, ‘powerful, ‘ripped’ and ‘battle scars.’

They also show the comradary and sisterhood that exist within the team, with shots showing them laughing together, hugging and standing arm in arm.

On the Rugged Grace tumbler site they explain: ‘We asked teammates to write what they loved and appreciated about each player on their body, in the hopes of opening a visual discussion about beauty, strength, and appreciation.

'We decided to have players write their favorite things about other players physically on their bodies to demonstrate the immense body positivity, encouragement of strength and utility, and the overall supportive nature of this team.

‘Rugby is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training, and that intense appreciation, love, trust, and support for each other is what we wanted to reflect. The sport necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful.’

The project ascertains that for a woman to love her body is a political statement

Two players happily show off their impressively muscular biceps, with the words 'huge' and 'ripped' written on

Despite being very simple, the photos mange to convey a powerful message and have gone viral online

The project says that mass media is sending girls the message that only slender, tall bodies are beautiful

Statements written explore the positive attitude of the women, and not necessarily the appearance of their body parts

The uplifting photos see the girls covered in affirming words and statements

Alongside the photo project, three members of the team wrote an essay for the Harvard Political review.

Brooke Kantor, Lydia Federico and Helen Clark say in the piece, entitled ‘An Exercise in Body Image’ that: ‘Loving one’s body is an inherently political act. Maintaining pride in having a body that is “too big,” “too small,” or “not ideal” is a political statement against the many voices that tell us our bodies are problematic.

‘Mainstream culture normalises the flawless bodies that dominate every kind of mass media, sending girls the message that only slender, tall bodies are beautiful.’
