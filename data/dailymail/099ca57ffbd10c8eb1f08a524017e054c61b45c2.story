In court: Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to the affair with an 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania

A former high school teacher admitted today to having sex with a 17-year-old student.

Rachel Farrell, 26, pleaded guilty to corrupting a minor in Northampton County Court, Pennsylvania.Â 

It emerged in February that the newlywed teacher had carried out the trysts in her car and in Ramada 
Inns.

She faces up to five years in prison when she next appears in court on May 25.

Farrell was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania.

The woman had only been married for two months when the sexual liaisons took place. She was teaching reading to the 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School.

She later resigned and got divorced. Police also believed she may have had sex with three other students.

However Assistant District Attorney Lara Mammana Kash declined to comment to local paper The Morning Call on the investigation into other potential victims.

The victim, who is now 18, told police he and his teacher began communicating on Facebook and had sexual encounters 'numerous times at many different locations', including parking in secluded spots.

Investigators said some of the encounters took place at a Walmart parking lot and twice at a Ramada Inn in Tannersville,
 Monroe County.

Scandal: Farrell resigned from her teaching post at Bangor Area High School and got divorced

Police said Farrell confessed to colleagues at the school that she had sex with two 17-year-old students, later also 
admitting it to county Detective Robert Righi.

Farrell was married in June 2010. The affair took place between August of the same 
year and January 2011.

Bangor Area High School is no stranger to controversy. A biology teacher fatally overdosed on heroin in 2009, while a male teacher's aide was jailed after admitting drug possession charges and of supplying drugs to students, one of whom went on to kill himself.

In 2010, a nude photo of a female teacher's aide was circulated on students' mobile phones.
