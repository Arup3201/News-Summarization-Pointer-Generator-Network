An MI5 agent praised by Tony Blair for playing a key role in the UK’s war on terror is suing the Government after being told that he can no longer live in Britain.

The 33-year-old Moroccan-born agent worked for MI5 for six years, risking his life to prevent terror attacks on the UK.

He infiltrated Islamic extremist cells and worked on investigations into the 7/7 attacks on London and the Madrid bombings as well as providing intelligence which led to the arrest of Al Qaeda terror suspects.

Now the Home Office has told him he has no right to remain in Britain because ministers say he has a criminal record.

His case is due to be heard at a high-profile immigration hearing in May, where MI5 has been asked to give evidence.

The agent, who married a British citizen with whom he has a five-year-old daughter, says he faces arrest and torture in his home country of Morocco if forced to leave.

The man left Morocco when he was 15 and arrived in Britain three years later.

He stayed in Finsbury Park Mosque where he met radical preacher Abu Hamza, whose followers sent him to Georgia and then Chechnya.

According to legal papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, he claims that when he returned from Georgia to the UK in 2000 he was approached by MI5 and recruited as an agent. In December 2001 he was sent on a mission to Belgium to infiltrate an extremist cell but was arrested by Belgian security services.

He was held in solitary confinement without charge for two years before being convicted for associating with terrorists and possessing a false travel document.

But in January 2004, when he faced a further two years in prison, he claims he was visited by an MI5 officer who told him then-Home Secretary David Blunkett had authorised his transfer to Britain.

He claims he was offered the choice of remaining in prison in Belgium, returning to Morocco – where he faced arrest and torture – or continuing his work for MI5.

The agent arrived in Britain in April on a specially chartered jet and immediately began training with MI5, including how to use fake documents and infiltrate extremist groups.

He provided vital intelligence on the detonation system used by the terrorists in the 2004 Madrid bombings and helped track down extremists linked to the bombers in the 7/7 attacks in 2005. He was also sent on a mission to Ireland to infiltrate a suspected Al Qaeda cell.

For this work he claims he was repeatedly told by MI5 that David Blunkett and Tony Blair were very pleased and that Mr Blair had personally made use of the intelligence he gathered from extremist groups.

But in February 2006 MI5 summoned him to a meeting in a hotel in Surrey, where he was told the relationship was being terminated because he was no longer any use to them.

He was offered a £10,000 bribe to leave the UK for Morocco and says in his legal claim that he chose to stay in the UK because he was promised he would be granted permanent residency if he remained.

But he alleges that since he left MI5 he has been betrayed, with MI5 refusing to return his calls and the Home Office rejecting his claims for residency. He says this has caused his marriage to end.

Last night David Blunkett denied he had any knowledge of the case.

The man’s Belgian lawyer, Christophe Marchand, said he ‘believed he had no choice’ but to work for MI5.
