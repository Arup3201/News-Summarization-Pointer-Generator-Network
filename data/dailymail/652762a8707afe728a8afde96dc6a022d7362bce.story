The new mother mauled to death yesterday while working at a big cat animal shelter, may have violated safety procedures according to a statement released by the organization.

Renee Radziwon-Chapman, 36, was already dead when emergency responders arrived at WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon Saturday night on reports that an employee was gravely injured. She was the sanctuary's animal care technician and also a new mother.

Few details have been released on the attack so far, but it appears that Radziwon-Chapman was breaking the facility's safety rules when she was attacked.

WildCat Haven in Sherwood, Oregon says animal technician Renee Radziwon-Chapman was alone in a cage of cougars when she was killed Saturday night.

Breaking the rules? According to a statement released by the sanctuary, Radziwon was discovered alone in an animal enclosure with cougars which goes against their safety guidelines. Above, Radziwon-Chapman gives a reporter a tour of the facility in 2011

A statement released by the organization 
refers to their safety handbook which requires staff members to work in 
pairs when going into animal enclosures. Once big cats are safely in 
'lockout areas' one team member can go into the enclosure.Â

'At this time it is believed that Radziwon-Chapman was alone at the sanctuary and alone in the enclosure with cats, who had not been shifted into the lockout area,' the statement said, adding that an investigation is ongoing.

While it was initially reported that several cats were loose within the sanctuary, the organization denied that saying that no cats escaped from their enclosures, which are surrounded by 14-foot tall walls.

'The enclosures exceed what is required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects the facility yearly,' they said.

The cougar responsible for Radziwon-Chapman's death was locked up after the attack.

'Right
now, out thoughts and prayers are with the family of our dear colleague
and friend who we have so sadly lost. We are devastated by this loss,' 
the statement said.

Radziwon-Chapman's husband, Aaron Chapman, had also volunteered at the facility in the past and the two recently had a baby girl.

WildCat Haven was started in 2001 by Cheryl and Michael Tuller who rescued one bobcat but their sanctuary has now grown to shelter 67 Cats. For the past eight years, Radziwon-Chapman has served as the head keeper at the facility and is also a certified tech.

As the sanctuary's first employee, Radziwon-Chapman has spoken to the media on behalf of the facility before.

In 2011, she gave KATU a tour of the facility for a story about people who keep big cats as exotic pets.

'I don't think people realize how many cats are in captivity in back yards,' Radziwon-Chapman said in 2011.

Some of the cats living at the sanctuary come from families who adopted them at a young age and then got overwhelmed with them once they grew into full-size cats.

Radziwon-Chapman's death came as a shock to WildCat Haven board member Jim Caliva.

'Her relationship with the cats was amazing,' he said. 'She knew exactly what she was going, but apparently there was a mistake. I don't know what it could be.'

Its website describes the facility as a 'last hope' for more than 60 wildcats that have been abandoned or abused, including bobcats, cougars, lynx and tigers.

Last summer, the sanctuary announced plans to move from its 8-acre facility in Sherwood to an 82-acre site near Silverton and launched a fundraising effort. The Tullers did not set a timetable for the move, the Oregonian reported.

The facility is not open to the public, but does provide on-site tours to donors.
