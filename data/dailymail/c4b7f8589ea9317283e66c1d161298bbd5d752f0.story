A 40-year-old mother-of two-has scored herself the prized position of an NFL cheerleader, beating out competitors half her age to join the New Orleans Saintsations.

Kriste Lewis, from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease 14 years ago, and as she approached her 40th birthday in April, she decided it was now or never if she wished to tick this lifelong dream off her bucket list.

'Today is the day, not tomorrow,' she told the Hattiesburg American. 'Wear your best shoes. Don’t save that bottle of wine... I know that I will be on dialysis and in need of a transplant, but I could be killed in a car wreck tomorrow.'

She made it! Kriste Lewis (pictured), a 40-year-old mother-of-two, has become the oldest New Orleans Saintsations cheerleader in the team's history, and achieved a lifelong dream just in time for her birthday

The feisty dancer, who appeared on ABC's Good Morning America this morning with her husband Tim, and sons Jake 14, and Rob, 11, trained hard for six months ahead of the try-outs; an experience she would have been happy to settle with as a birthday present to herself on its own.

Mrs Lewis did not disclose her age during the first round of nerve-wracking auditions in April, and she held on to her husband's motto 'focus and fun' to keep her eye on the prize.

She impressed the judges strictly based on her dancing abilities alone, and two rounds later, it was unanimously decided that she should make the team.

Energetic: Mrs Lewis works part time as a fitness instructor, but says she had forgotten just how much she loves to dance

'I had honestly forgotten how much I loved to dance,' Mrs Lewis, who works part-time as a fitness instructor, admits. 'I told my husband, "Please remind me after this audition to not stop dancing."'

Mrs Lewis joins 35 other women in the new team, some as young as 19, and most in their early to mid-20s.

'It’s a family,' Mrs Lewis told the Hattiesburg American. 'It’s like I have 35 little sisters. They are such sweet girls. All of the girls are so intelligent and they are so kind and well-rounded.'

She will have to wait until September for the defining moment when she cheers her first Saints game, a team she has been a lifelong fan of, and an honor she never expected to experience.

'If I died tomorrow, I’m good. I’m a happy girl. It’s been a blast'

'I can’t even fathom what it’s going to be like to walk out on that field in the Superdome with all those Saints fans,' she said. 'I hope I don’t pass out. If I died tomorrow, I’m good. I’m a happy girl. It’s been a blast.'

Mrs Lewis isn't far behind the oldest NFL cheerleader in history; Laura Vikmanis, now 45. Mrs Vikmanis is a cheerleader for the Cincinnati Ben-Gals, who was also 40 when she made it to the team. She has since written a book, entitled It's Not About The Pom-Poms, and New Line Cinema is currently making a film about her life.
