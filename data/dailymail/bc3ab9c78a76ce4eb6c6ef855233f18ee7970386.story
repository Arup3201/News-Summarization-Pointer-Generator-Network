As a new steamy trailer for Fifty Shades Of Grey is released,  E.L. James has given her fans a chance to channel their inner Anastasia. 

Fresh from the release of the two-and-a half-minute preview,which shows Jamie Dornan's Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) finally getting down to business in the bedroom, the author has unveiled her Christmas lingerie range.

Following the successful launch of its debut collection in September, the festive Fifty Shades of Grey Lingerie and Sleepwear for women range is about to land in Tesco.

It's here! The official Fifty Shades Of Grey Christmas lingerie range designed in collaboration with E.L. James will arrive in Tesco ahead of the festive season

Designed in collaboration with the steamy author herself, the collection is inspired by the global best-selling trilogy.

The range, which arrives in store on November 24, comprises of 19 new pieces, including logo sleep-masks and sheer lingerie in jewel tones. 

Speaking about her new offering, E. L. James, who was involved at every stage of the creative process, said: 'For the Christmas collection we wanted dark and sensual pieces with a hint of decadence. 

'We went for rich, deep red and midnight black to create a forbidden allure, and used signature embroidered elements and silk trimmings to add a touch of festive luxury'.

Bedroom style: Speaking about her new offering, E. L. James said that she and the team wanted dark and sensual pieces with a hint of decadence

Would Anastasia approve? The colour palette is one of rich, deep red and midnight black to create what E.L. James calls a 'forbidden allure'

Something for everyone: The range of emblazoned pants and bras costs between £5-£25 and sizes range from 32B - 38DD

Comfy and casual: As well as more revealing pieces, there's simple pyjamas too 

There's balconette bras and plunge bras with matching briefs and thongs and side tie pants emblazoned with phrases such as ‘no peeping’. 

E. L. James added: 'Designing the collection was a very organic process. It was important that every piece should be distinctly Fifty Shades, so we included iconic elements such as the Fifty Shades mask in the lace embroidery for the Seduction range, and a crystal key charm for the silk Temptation.'

The range, which was shot by industry heavyweight Rankin, costs between £5-£25 and sizes range from 32B - 38DD.

Anticipation for the film is mounting following the release of the full trailer today.

Anastasia is shown in a blindfold and Christian is seen undressing his beau in his bedroom, before taking her to see his 'playroom.'

There's plenty of old fashioned romantic moments too. The billionaire Christian takes his new girlfriend up in both his plane and helicopter, also bringing her to meet his family for dinner.

There they meet his adopted mother and sister Mia - played by Rita Ora in a bobbed wig. 

In action: Grabs of the movie have been released and Anastasia is shown in a blindfold and Christian is seen undressing her

Cashing in: British author E.L James saw her tome become the best-selling book in Britain, and the fastest-selling paperback book of all time
