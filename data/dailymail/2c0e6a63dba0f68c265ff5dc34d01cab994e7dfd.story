He is the baby-faced ladies man and self-proclaimed 'unrivaled intellect' who was left red-faced when he was sent packing on The Young Apprentice last year.

But despite missing out on the much coveted title, 18-year-old Harry Maxwell has proven his critics (and Lord Sugar) wrong by launching a host of projects, one of which is selling Demi Moore's beauty range on his website.

The 49-year-old's range, which is titled More by Demi, has been launched by Oriflame and will be sold on Harry's website LegitEssentials.com- an online department store retailing not-on-the-high-street luxury well-being brands.

Demi has been working on the range for a year and Harry could not be more excited to be selling it on his site

'I can't believe that in a year I have been on The Young Apprentice and now I am working on all of these projects, it is amazing,' said Harry in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

Demi has been working on the four-piece range for a year and has created the brand to empower women.

'She feels that her products should give women confidence at a young age. It is entitled "More by Demi" because she wants people to strive for more in their lives,' explained Harry.

Harry's glamorous and entrepreneurial new life is a far cry from his humble beginnings on the BBC show, where he came in joint third place.

The product range features perfume, body cream, shower cream and hair spray and the introductory price is of £28.90 for the next two weeks

'It was a shame that I didn't win and at the time it was such a massive deal but I am the only one who has gone on to do something.

'In terms of proving Lord Sugar wrong, 
the winner Zara Brownless, from what she told me directly, informed Lord Sugar she
 didn't have any big plans for the next five years while she finishes 
school and uni, but in the meantime has bought an Apple MacBook Pro with
 her 25k prize fund.

'I have clearly done more than that, but for me it's
 not about beating my former competitors, it's about being the best I 
can be,' said Harry.

Despite his own mother even calling him arrogant, Harry has been made an ambassador for professional networking site LinkedIn in the UK and is also set to launch two new projects and team up with a Made In Chelsea star to launch their body care range alongside his studies at the London School of Economics.

Although Harry didn't win the series, he maintains that he is the only one who has gone on to be a success

He said: 'It may sound cliche but I genuinely want to succeed more than I want to breathe and I will never ever stop trying to better myself.

'Last year I was working with Lord Sugar and Karren Brady, this year I'm working on all this. I'm never going to give up.

'Finishing third in The Young Apprentice Semi-Final in a twist where all the losing team were sent home was just the start of me, and it always would have been that way no matter where I finished.'

Outside of the boardroom Harry is just like any other teenager, he loves partying and having fun with his friends.

Harry is wholly embarrassed by the photographs of him partying in Mahiki

The Rugby school boy caused a stir last year when he was photographed drinking a £1,000 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne in Mayfair haunt Mahiki with young blonde ladies hanging off his arm (and face).

'Those pictures were horrendous and tragic but at least they weren't self taken,' he joked.

Although Harry sacrificed his relationship with his girlfriend when he was caught in a love triangle with fellow contestants Hayley Forrester and Zara Brownless, Harry isn't in touch with the pair anymore.

'It is so hard to stay in touch with everyone from the show. I did actually bump into Lord Sugar at the BAFTAS and had a thirty second conversation with him.

'I would love for him to know what I am doing and I really want to update him on my projects.'

With the latest series launching on-screen next week, Harry has some advice to the eager contestants.

He said: 'Remember that at the end of the day it is just a competition but play your own game. I have learnt to never say never to anything and I want to make as much money as possible.'

Harry advises this year's contestants to focus on their own game just like he did
