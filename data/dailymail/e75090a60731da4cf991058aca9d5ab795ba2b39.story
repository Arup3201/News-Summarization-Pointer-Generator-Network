Manchester United's new summer signings Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind celebrated their team's 4-0 Premier League win against QPR with a Chinese meal. 

Falcao and Blind were joined by Dutch duo Robin van Persie and Patrick Kluivert as they dined out at Wing's Chinese restaurant in Manchester. 

Blind was joined by his famous father Danny and his girlfriend Candy-Rae Fleur while Falcao, wearing a T-shirt paying homage to martial arts movie legend Bruce Lee was all smiles as he cradled his daughter.

The United stars certainly had something to celebrate after picking up their first three points of the season with an impressive win against Harry Redknapp's side.

Goals from Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata helped Louis van Gaal's side sail to a victory which lifted the gloom from a tough start to the season.

Despite Sunday's emphatic win, Van Gaal claimed he was quick to warn his players there is still plenty of room for improvement.

The Dutchman's new-look side ran Rio Ferdinand and his QPR team-mates ragged all afternoon, but the United boss insists there is yet more to come from his squad, which was only completed last Monday following the deadline-day signings of Falcao and Blind.

'The result is fantastic, but I think we can do much better,' Van Gaal said.

'I said (before the match): 'let's make a new start today'. 

'I have made now the (squad) selection of 27 players - three goalkeepers and 24 players, you shall see it Tuesday with the photoshoot, that is our squad.'

Van Gaal was even restrained is his post-match praise for Di Maria, who set United on their way with a curling free-kick and then had a hand in the other three goals.

'When you prepare three goals and make the first goal by yourself then you cannot play bad but he had a lot of unnecessary losses so we can do better,' the former Ajax manager said.

Falcao missed a chance to score on his United debut but insists he will make a big impact.

'I will fight to stay here to play many years for Manchester United, I want to make my mark here,' he told Sky Sports. 'I would like to be a legend at this club.'

The Colombia striker added that his aim was always to play for a club like United, saying: 'I refused another club with Champions League pedigree for this club. I am so excited, I always worked to arrive at a club like this.'

Falcao tweeted after the match: 'Very happy to debut in Old Trafford and for all the support I received from the first day in @ManUtd.'
