Court: Junior doctor Suhail Ahmed sexually assaulted and secretly photographed female patients during intimate examinations

A junior doctor sexually assaulted and secretly photographed female patients during intimate examinations.

Suhail Ahmed, 28, touched the women, all in their 20s, as he removed their clothing in order to get a better view of their bodies for his mobile phone camera.

Ahmed, who worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, was today jailed for 18 months.

Exeter Crown Court heard Ahmed would section his victims' beds off from the rest of the ward so he was alone with them.

Ahmed, of Cyncoed Road in Cardiff, then carried out intimate examinations claiming his mobile phone was being used to time their heart rate.

The court was told some of his patients were in extreme pain or recovering from surgery at the time of his attacks, which were carried out between March and June last year.

He was suspended by the hospital after he was caught when two women separately made complaints.

A subsequent police investigation uncovered 110 images of patients at the hospital in 'various stages of undress' uploaded onto his computer from his phone camera.

Footage from a secret camera Ahmed hid in a property owned by his family was also discovered.

Ahmed later pleaded guilty to 11 counts of voyeurism and two counts of sexual assault by touching.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC jailed Ahmed for 18 months and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for the 'very serious offences'.

'You asked female patients in their 20s to remove more clothing than was necessary for examination purposes and on two occasions you touched them,' the judge said.

'You then used your mobile phone during examinations to photograph those patients. You said you were using your phone to time their breathing or their heart rate.

'Your victims describe their distress at what you did and the continued effect it has had upon them. A doctor is trusted not only by his patients but also by his employers.'

Exeter Crown Court heard the offences took place when Ahmed was working as a trainee surgeon.

Prosecuting, David Bowen said: 'The defendant from time to time used to examine female patients.'

'All of the victims are female and in their 20s. The defendant took photographs with his mobile phone of the unclothed and uncovered parts of his female patients.'

Mr Bowen said Ahmed also performed 'perfectly appropriate' medical procedures on his patients.

Footage from a secret camera - also 
believed to have been taken last year - hidden in a property owned by 
Ahmed's family was also found. It showed young women using the bathroom.Â 

'These files included sound and the victims have not been identified,' Mr Bowen said.

Ahmed initially denied any wrongdoing but later admitted the offences in police interview.

Mr Bowen said his victims had been left devastated by their ordeal, with one left unable to leave her house.

Defending, David Martin insisted the photographs had not been distributed or shown to anyone.

'Here is an individual who has in every way ruined his career,' Mr Martin said.

'It was a tremendous achievement to get to where he had and it has been thrown away in this ridiculous behaviour.'
