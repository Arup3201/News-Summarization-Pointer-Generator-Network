She might be just 16 years old but Becca Caxton from Hull has big plans for her future - and for that of her family.

Despite her tender years and lack of work, Becca is planning for life as a benefits mother - much to the horror of her mother Anita, 38.

'I think kids shouldn't have kids and I 
told that to Becca before she got pregnant,' fumes Anita, 38, who has a part time role as a delivery driver for Iceland.

Pregnant: Becca Caxton, 16, is pregnant and has dropped out of school to live on benefits

'I don't think it is right. I
 think they should both work, work until they're much older and can 
provide and be responsible for a child.'

Becca, however, says she wants to move out and plans to move into a council flat with boyfriend Sonny Smith, 17, when the baby arrives.

'I do feel bad for [moving out and getting benefits] but obviously I 
need the money to provide for a baby so she's [Anita] just going to have to deal
 with it,' says Becca.

'I don't care what people say about me being 16 and pregnant 
because I wanted it and it's not their lives and anyone can look after a
 baby - it's not hard to do.'

Becca's hometown, Hull, has a teenage pregnancy rate 60 per cent higher than the national average - and the unemployment figures to match.

Not only is the Yorkshire town home to the highest percentage of job seekers in the UK, the youth unemployment rate is above 25 per cent.

Worried: Boyfriend Sonny says he wants to finish college and get a job to support his new family

Children: Becca's mother Anita, 38, says she is horrified by her daughter's choice and wants her to get a job

As a result, many teenagers, among them Becca's sister Charlotte, 19, and brother Michael, 18, have joined the dole queue and show little inclination to do anything else.

'Teenagers are a pain in the backside,' says their mother Anita, 
'because when there's nothing out there for them, they don't want to get 
up, they don't want to do anything, they complain they're bored... 
They're the bane of my life they are!'

Anita herself was on the dole until recently, only getting a job when faced with losing £120 a week in child benefits should Becca move out.

Nevertheless, she has high hopes for her children and says she'd like them to do better, in particular Charlotte.

'It's quite annoying to think that you are 19-years-old and you can't do anything,' complains a furious Anita to a reluctant Charlotte. 'You could be a barrister. You could be a solicitor!'

Unfortunately for Charlotte, she, like Becca, has little in the way of qualifications and failed to pass her English and maths GCSES.

Boyfriend Sonny does have qualifications and has just started college but despite admitting to misgivings, says he will go along with Becca's plans for a benefits baby.

Bad odds: Becca and Sonny live in Hull, one of the worst parts of the country for youth unemployment

Hard: Becca's sister Charlotte and brother Michael both sign on due to lack of job and learning opportunities

'It was a real shock due to me being 
really young and having just started college, so not really able to provide for
 a baby,' says Sonny of the moment he discovered he would become a father.

'Thanks to the benefits system, it's going to be a lot easier.'

Becca has no such qualms, with her only complaint being told she can't start claiming benefits on her own account until the baby is born.

'I was so happy,' she says of the moment her pregnancy was confirmed. 'I was just smiling in the doctors but I knew I wanted it. I can't wait to move out!'

While Sonny has qualms about being on benefits and Anita has found a part time job, it seems the only member of the Caxton family reluctant to sign on is the youngest, 15-year-old Aaron.

'I'm not going to be signing on because 
you don't learn anything from that,' he insists. 'I think everyone who signs on  in 
this house is ridiculous!'

But Anita has other ideas. 'He's got learning difficulties to an 
extent, he's deaf... I suppose if somebody saw him, they would say he 
was going to end up on the social.'

For Aaron's sake, you can't help but hope she's wrong.

The Caxton family appear on Britain on Benefits: Life on the Dole, which airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 5
