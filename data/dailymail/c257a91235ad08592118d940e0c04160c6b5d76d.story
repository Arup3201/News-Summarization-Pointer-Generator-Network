Shocking: The point-blank use of Tasers to stun suspects is being discouraged by senior police as fears over the effects of the weapon grow

Senior police officers are under growing pressure to stop their officers using 50,000-volt Tasers at point-blank range.

A review is to be published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the use of Tasers in the so-called drive-stun mode.

This refers to the use of the stun gun as a close range weapon, where the cartridge is removed and is thrust into an individual’s body in a move designed to inflict pain.

Police are being told to dramatically reduce the frequency of such deployments.

The directive comes as new figures show the use of Tasers by police in England and Wales has more than doubled to 7,250 deployments a year, raising fresh concern about the risks to the public of more widespread use of the devices.

Office for National Statistics numbers, due to be released on Tuesday, will show deployment of the weapons has risen from around 3,500 in 2009 to 14,500 in the two years 2010 and 2011 – 7,250 a year.

Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the IPCC, told the Guardian: ‘We have specific concerns about some of the ways and circumstances in which [Taser] is used.

‘We have expressed concerns to Acpo about the use of Taser in the drive-stun method.’

Jules Carey, a lawyer who represents several clients taking action against the police over Taser use, said: ‘There is a real concern around training and judgment.

‘The worry is that Tasers may become the default method of restraint rather than being used as nearly lethal force to prevent serious crime.’

The rise in Taser use comes after the Home Office began rolling out 5,500 new weapons to forces across the country in 2008 after changes allowed the weapons to be used by non-specialist police officers after three days’ training rather than only by specially trained firearms officers.Currently, 11 per cent of police officers – 14,700 – are armed with Tasers.

The number of officers trained to use Tasers has jumped dramatically in the last few years

The Association of Chief Police Officers said the use of drive-stun is discouraged because it is ineffective, usually used after the officer has missed with the weapon, and often simply enrages the suspect.

Simon Chesterman, Acpo's spokesman on
armed police, said there were ‘valid concerns’ about the use of Tasers 
in the drive-stun move - but questioned the figures.

He
said the rise in deployments corresponded to the increase in weapons 
being rolled out across the country, and did not represent Tasers being 
used more often.

Taser use in the figures covers drawing the weapon but not firing, aiming the weapon and engaging the red light on the suspect, using in the drive stun mode and firing the Taser – which happens in only around 25 per cent of cases, according to Acpo. 

Mr Chesterman said: ‘These figures show the use of Taser has increased in line with the rollout of more weapons.

‘There will be concerns raised by individuals that don’t necessarily understand the underlying causes of the increase and there will be people raising concerns over this who don’t agree with the police having Tasers.

‘I would argue that there are more valid concerns around drive-stun and around Taser use on vulnerable people than on these figures.’

Jules Carey is a lawyer representing a number of clients taking action against the police over Taser use.

He
said: 'They are being used as a convenience to assist with restraint, 
rather than disarming someone who may have a lethal weapon themselves.'

Police are also under pressure over Taser deployments against vulnerable individuals.

In
April, 32-year-old Andrew Pimlott – who had doused himself in petrol 
and was threatening to kill himself – died in a fireball after police 
fired a Taser at him outside his home in Plymouth, Devon.

In 2011 a 12-year-old girl was shot by police with a 50,000-volt Taser.

The
girl, who was brandishing two knives and threatening to harm herself, 
was one of more than 20 children shot by officers using the electric 
stun guns, figures show.

In
July Jordan Begley, 23, of Gorton, Manchester is suspected to have had a
fatal heart attack after being hit by the 50,000 volt charge by a police officer.

A police enquiry is under way into the death, after it emerged that Mr Begley may have been mistaken for a wanted man with the same name

Officers were called to the ice cream factory worker’s home by his mother Dot to deal with a row between him and a neighbour.

She
claimed her son was unarmed and ‘calm and compliant’ before he was 
shot, which left him ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes 
flickering’.

There have been seven taser-related deaths in the UK since 2004, all believed to be from the conventional use of the weapon

Six weeks before the incident he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests to diagnose a suspected heart condition when he died.

On nine occasions, youths were subjected to the drive-stun technique.

Police
said the Taser was used to  detain the girl and ‘prevent serious harm 
to both her, the public and the officers’ after she began behaving 
‘aggressively’ in St Helens, Merseyside, in July 2011.

The
schoolgirl was one of  more than 20 children stunned with the weapons 
in the past three years,  according to figures obtained under the 
Freedom of Information Act.

They included six children aged 14, four aged 15 and 13 aged 16.

Police officers have also shot 75 dogs, two cows and a sheep with Tasers stun-guns since 2010.

Last week, the Crown Prosecution 
Service said it was not laying charges against an officer who deployed a
Taser against blind man Colin Farmer, 63.

The police officer mistook his white stick for a samurai sword. The blunder happened on October 12 last year after reports were received of a man walking through the town centre in Chorley, Lancashire, with a martial arts weapon.

Mr Farmer, who has suffered two strokes and walks at a 'snail’s pace', was on his way to a pub to meet friends for a drink and did not realise anything was wrong until the officer Tasered him.

The grandfather, who is now pursuing legal action against Lancashire Constabulary, was taken to hospital before being released.

Police later arrested a 27-year old man believed to be the real offender but he was released without charge after no weapon was found.

Mr Farmer, who has five sons and two grandchildren, said: ‘This officer displayed that his judgement was clouded because he clearly can’t tell the difference between a disabled old man and a criminal.

‘I am devastated that the CPS have made this decision because I am now worried about the safety of others as this trigger-happy officer continues to patrols our streets.

He added: ‘I was slowly making my way down the street when I heard this man shouting. I had no idea it was directed at me and I thought I was being mugged.

‘But suddenly I felt a huge force on my back and this electric shock went right through my body and I collapsed in a heap on the floor. I was shouting all the time, “I’m blind! I’m blind!”

'After Mr Farmer fell to the floor face down, the police officer knelt on his back before handcuffing him.

Mr Farmer said: ‘By this stage he could clearly see that I was disabled and my walking stick was in full view but he couldn’t wait to force his knee into my back and hurt me.'

The officer now faces a gross misconduct hearing.
