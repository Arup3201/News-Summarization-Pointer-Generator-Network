Tiny the formerly obese cat has a lot to purr about these days.

Not only has he lost half his body weight, the orphaned feline has found a new home.

The pudgy pet was dumped outside the Fredericton SPCA in New Brunswick, Canada, just over a year ago weighing a whopping 30lbs.

But, after sticking to a strict diet, the ironically-named feline is now fit and healthy and has been officially adopted by foster parent, Nancy Garon.

Garon even threw an adoption party for Tiny on Saturday, dressing the noticeably more slender cat in a sparkly bow tie.

'It was a nice way to celebrate all the work, dedication and time that went into Tiny,' LeeAnn Haggerty, the director of education at the shelter, told TODAY.com.

'She's really bonded with him and it's nice for everyone to know that he'll be doing well in Nancy's care.'

The animal has a penchant or bow 
ties, which are made by some of the many volunteers who have tracked his
weight loss progress on Facebook.

Lighter: The pudgy pet was dumped outside the Fredericton SPCA in New Brunswich, Canada, just over a year ago weighing a whopping 30lbs but now weighs just 16lbs

Donations and sales of Tiny's Ties have already raised $10,000 for the Fredericton SPCA, Today reported.

Tiny now ways 16 pounds and the weight loss has transformed his life.

'As soon as he lost the first six pounds you could start to see the changes,' Haggerty said.

'To
not be able to groom yourself must've been pretty frustrating. When he 
walked, he used to take a few steps, but now he runs all over the place.
He is a very playful cat.'

Big surprise: Tiny, left, and his buddy, Rapunzel, arrived in a cardboard box at a Canadian animal rescue center

Fat cat: When Tiny arrived at the Fredericton SPCA, he weighed in at 30.2lbs, or about three times the size of an average house cat

Cat with a plan: Tiny was put on a calorie-controlled weight loss regimen

Baby steps: Initially, Tiny would hardly walk, and even swatting at a feather wand would wear him out

In
August, the cat had lost more than 10 pounds, weighing in at 19.1lbs. 
Haggerty said back then that it had taken a lot of hard work to bring 
Tiny's weight down to that point.

'When he came to the shelter, we knew
this weight was a medical emergency, really that obesity in pets can be
fatal; his weight was quite a concern,' she told CBC News.

Tiny,
who at that point was about three times the size of an average house 
cat, was taken to Dr Nicole Jewett at Valley Veterinary Hospital, who 
created a special calorie-controlled weight-loss plan for him at a 
foster home.

Breakthrough: On January 24, Tiny weighed in at just under 28lbs after shedding more than two pounds

Shedding pounds: Thanks to eating right and being more active, Tiny lost about 6lbs from his starting weight

On track: With his weight melting away, Tiny's coat became shiner and he started getting playful again

Getting trim: On June 12, The once-grossly overweight feline dropped to impressive 21.13lbs

The drastic weight loss has been 
accompanied by a significant improvement in Tiny’s appearance and 
well-being, according to his veterinarian.

When the pet first arrived at the 
center, his coat and eyes were dull, and he could only make a few steps 
at a time before he would have to lie down.

Thanks to his new svelte physique, however, Tiny has become more playful and active. 

'He runs, he plays — it's amazing,' Haggerty said.

Celebrity status: One of Tiny's supporters has created a clothing line for the shrinking feline

Force for good: The SPCA created signature Tiny ties, which they sell online to raise medical funds for animals 

Milestone: On August 16, Tiny reached an important benchmark when he was weighed in at 19.11lbs

Another
fringe benefit that came as a result of Tiny's impressive slim-down is 
popularity.

Fans send in fabric to the SPCA, which
they use to make the signature Tiny ties and sell them on the site 
Etsy.com to raise medical funds for animals.

According
to Haggerty, about 40-60 per cent of North American pets are 
overweight, and in cats, it can lead to diabetes, arthritis, organ 
issues and even death.
