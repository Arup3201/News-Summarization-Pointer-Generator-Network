The three women held captive in a Cleveland house before escaping a year ago Tuesday have spent their first year of freedom in nearly a decade learning to drive, taking boxing lessons and cherishing time with their families.

Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus both said in statements released Monday that they are thankful and growing in many ways.

Michelle Knight said in an interview on NBC's Today show Monday that she forgives the man who kidnapped and tortured her and the two others. She said Ariel Castro deserves forgiveness because she'd want to be forgiven if she did wrong, and 'that's the way of life.'

Tuesday is the anniversary of the escape from the house by Knight, Berry and DeJesus. Knight, 33, said she doesn't see much of the other two women, saying 'we're all now living in our own way.'

DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped by Castro. She said she's enjoying learning how to drive and use new technology. 'I am spending time with my family and working with Amanda on a book that we are really excited about,' she said.

Berry said the future is bright for her and thanked her family and friends for support.

'On this day, we decided that the right place for us to be was with other families who have gone through what our family has gone through,' Berry said. 'I want these families to know they will always have a special place in our hearts.'

Knight - who has a book coming out Tuesday - said she's a singer who just recorded a song, and she's also training to be a boxer.

Knight said in the interview that she was surprised when Castro, who pleaded guilty in August, killed himself in prison, wondering 'why would he hurt his children like that?'

Berry was 14, DeJesus was 16 and Knight was 20 when they disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004. They were rescued from Castro's rundown house May 6, 2013, after Berry broke through a screen door.

Berry and DeJesus are collaborating with two Washington Post reporters on a book due out next year. Charles Ramsey, the man credited with helping the women escape from the house, also has written a book.

Amanda Berry: 'I would like to thank all the people who have helped and supported my family and me. You have changed our lives in ways you'll never know. On this day, we decided that the right place for us to be was with other families who have gone through what our family has gone through. I want these families to know they will always have a special place in our hearts. So much has happened this past year. I have grown. I am strong. And I have so much to live for, to look forward to. The future is bright.'

Gina DeJesus: 'I want to thank everyone who donated to the Courage Fund and sent gifts to me. You have made such a difference in my life. This past year has been amazing, full of healing and hope. I am spending time with my family and working with Amanda on a book that we are really excited about. I have also been enjoying new experiences, such as learning how to use new technology and how to drive. Thanks for continuing to respect my privacy and that of my family.'
