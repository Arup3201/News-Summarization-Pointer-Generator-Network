Manchester United Treble winner Jonathan Greening has signed for non-League outfit Tadcaster Albion in the ninth-tier of English football.

Greening, who was a member of United's historic all-conquering squad during the 1998/99 season, joined the Yorkshire-based club on Thursday.

The 35-year-old had initially retired from football earlier this week after being on trial at League Two outfit Hartlepool.

However, the midfielder has decided to reverse his decision and join his brother Josh at the the i2i Sports Stadium.

Greening, who started his career at York City in 1996 before moving to United, could make his debut on Saturday against Maltby Main in the Toolstation NCEL Premier Division.

Following a four-season stint at Old Trafford the midfielder had spells at Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion, Fulham. 

He also played for Nottingham Forest but was sent out on loan to Barnsley during that time.

Greening is the latest former Premier League player to move into non-League football following Simon Davies' decision to play for Wales amateur side Solva FC in the Pembrokeshire League Division Two.
