A city hospital is begging patients to stop stealing its pyjamas after losing more than 1,900 pairs since January.

Pyjamas are one of the items most often taken from hospitals by patients when they are discharged.

But after being left with just 73 of the 2,000 new sets bought at the start of the year, Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire, have pleaded with patients to stop.

A medical pyjama set costs £6 each - meaning the hospital has lost out on more than £11,000 in clothing.

Walking sticks and blankets are also frequently taken away as patients hurriedly collect their belongings before leaving.

The University Hospital Southampton NHS trust, which runs the General Hospital, is now offering an amnesty on items taken from its premises in an effort to solve the problem.

Juliet Cox, head of patient experience, said: 'The loss of any hospital property, whether clothing, crutches or other equipment, has an impact in terms of supplies for other patients and the cost of replacements.

'We will always have gowns and nightwear available to protect patients' privacy and dignity.

'But a few small steps can ensure we avoid unnecessarily purchasing additional clothing and can put the funds to better use.

'We are working with patients and staff to highlight the problem.

'We've launched a project with nursing and care homes across the city to ensure patients have their own clothes to return home in, or are supplied with disposable alternatives.'

The hospital has also updated its 'Your Stay in Hospital' booklets which highlight the need for patients to bring their own clothes.
