The US-led coalition hit Islamic State group targets in Syria's central province of Homs for the first time Saturday as it pressed what Washington says are 'near continuous' strikes, a monitoring group said.

The coalition also targeted IS, also known as Isis, in the town of Minbej, east of second city Aleppo, for the first time, as well as multiple targets in the jihadist heartland province of Raqa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the targets hit in Homs province were far away from the front line with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, who control Homs city, Syria's third largest.

'The US-Arab coalition has for the first time struck IS bases in the eastern desert of Homs province,' Abdel Rahman said, adding that the positions were in the area of Al-Hammad, east of ancient city Palmyra.

Washington has been keen not to let Assad's forces exploit the air campaign against IS to take the upper hand in the more than three-year-old civil war.

In eastern Aleppo province - the western limit of IS control - the coalition hit several jihadist targets in Minbej, said the Observatory, which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports.

Further east, the coalition pounded the city of Raqa, which the jihadists have made their headquarters, the Britain-based group said.

Airstrikes in northern Syria killed the 'world's most wanted terrorist' before his band of Islamist militants were able to carry out deadly 'toothpaste tube bomb attacks' on the U.S. and Europe, American officials believe.

Muhsin al-Fadhl, 33, was identified as the leader of the Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group - a radical terror collective specializing in intercepting Western jihadists on their arrival in Syria, and training them to carry out deadly bomb attacks on targets in their home nations.

As well as an American and Arab coalition hitting targets relating to ISIS militants in Syria yesterday, the U.S. air force also independently struck Khorasan as intelligence suggested the group were nearing 'the execution phase' of a terror atrocity against a Western target that could have rivalled 9/11.

Details of the alleged death of al-Fadhl emerged this afternoon from a U.S. military official speaking on condition of anonymity.

Despite his relatively young age, the Kuwait-born militant was an Al Qaeda veteran; joining the terror group as a teenager and becoming so close to its leadership that he was among a select few with prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks in America, despite having only just turned 20 at the time.

'At least 31 explosions were heard in Raqa city and its surroundings.'

The strikes also hit IS targets around the town of Tabqa, which houses an air base whose capture by the jihadists last month sealed their occupation of the whole of Raqa province, as well as two training camps, the Observatory added.

The United States and its Arab allies launched air strikes against IS and other jihadist positions in northern and eastern Syria on Tuesday.

A US defence official told AFP on Friday that the mission is now similar to US-led air raids against IS in Iraq, with 'near continuous' combat flight operations over Syria.

It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark added their firepower to the operation against Isis. 

The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency. 

Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea on Friday for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.'

'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a "walk on by" option. There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.'

Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq.

That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria.

British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result.

The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition.

'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.

Air strikes by the UK will increase the risk of terror attacks in Britain by jihadists returning from fighting in Syria and Iraq, the EU’s anti-terrorism chief warned yesterday.

The number of Europeans fighting for IS was rising all the time, posing a major threat to EU countries, said Gilles de Kerchove.

If his figure of 3,000 is correct, it means that almost a tenth of Islamic State fighters may be European, with some 500 of those coming from Britain.

Mr de Kerchove said it was significant that France, the only European nation so far to have carried out air strikes, has already been singled out by IS for terrorist attacks targeting the Paris metro.

Speaking to the BBC, Mr de Kerchove also warned that groups competing with IS, such as Al Qaeda, may try to launch attacks in Europe to maintain their profile.
