Britain's most dangerous roads are in Lincolnshire, a new report has revealed.

The county was named as the place where more drivers, passengers and pedestrians were killed  than anywhere else in the country.

The study also found that residents living in rural communities nationally were more likely to be 'killed or seriously injured' on the roads.

This is because vehicles travel faster and there are fewer traffic calming measures, according to the research carried out by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTs) and Direct Line Car Insurance.

This is compared to more urban areas where casualty rates were well below the national average. 

The report calculated the casualty rates for residents of each parliamentary constituency.

Those in the North and East of England had the highest  in Britain, with both Lincolnshire and Lancashire having three constituencies each in the top ten.

It concluded that Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, had the highest road casualty rate in Britain.

The town's casualty figures were 53 per cent higher her than the national average.

Banff and Buchan in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, had the highest number of people killed or seriously injured, with figures 111 per cent above the national average.

By contrast, South Wales had the lowest rates for  casualties killed or seriously injured. 

Four Cardiff constituencies, along with Torfaen and Newport West, ranked in the bottom 10.

In 2013 a total of 183,670 people were reported injured on British roads, including 23,370 killed or seriously injured, at a cost to society of £15 billion.

There are three main factors affecting deaths and serious injury on the roads, the report said.

The first is the driver's behaviour, including speeding, drink and drug driving, non-use of seat-belts and use of mobiles behind the wheel.

The second is the safety quality of the road network itself and the vehicles using it, and the third is the quality of emergency medical system and trauma care in that particular region. 

David Davies, Executive Director of PACTS said: 'Road collisions remain a major cause of death and serious injury in Britain. 

'Traffic danger has a significant negative influence on society, it discourages people from walking or cycling, restricts the freedom of children and means vulnerable road users feel intimidated. 

'Despite great improvements in emergency services and trauma care, thousands of victims of road collisions are left with life-changing injuries while the families of casualties also find their lives changed forever.' 

Mike Holliday-Williams, Managing Director Personal Lines at Direct Line added: 'Good information is an essential basis for effective road safety action.

'Now, for the first time, MPs have specific road casualty information based on their constituency boundaries and its residents. 

'We hope the Road Safety Dashboard will provide a catalyst for action aimed at reducing deaths and injury at a local level, as the diversity of results demonstrate there is a no 'one size fits all' solution . 

'The Dashboard will become a vital tool in helping improve the safety of Britain's roads.
