The next 30 minutes are going to be a challenge for Steven Gerrard. From the moment he walks into a meeting room at Liverpool’s plush hotel, he knows where the conversation will head.

As soon as he puts his phone and wash bag on the floor and settles into a chair, he knows it will be  necessary to revisit the events of April 27.

That, of course, was the day Liverpool’s exhilarating surge to win a first league title since 1990 came asunder; the day the fates conspired against him.

He had set himself to control a ball from Mamadou Sakho when he slipped and Chelsea striker Demba Ba sped away. Thousands of dreams died as Chelsea won 2-0.

With some players, reopening old wounds would be strictly off limits but Gerrard is different. He has never shied away from the difficult subjects and, even though this is particularly painful, he is not about to start now.

So how was it after Chelsea?

‘You are a brave man asking this question,’ comes the reply, his eyes narrowing. ‘How do you think it was? You tell me.’

The worst day of your life?

‘There’s your answer.’

Once the issue is broached, Gerrard opens up. Few people in football speak with such searing honesty and, in some ways, this is cathartic. It has been a demanding, draining period in his professional life but speaking about it now can bring closure.

‘It was cruel,’ he says. ‘I haven’t lost my man at a set piece. I haven’t missed a penalty. I haven’t made a bad pass or a mistake. Every single person on the planet slips at some point in their life, whether it is on a set of stairs, on the floor or whatever.

‘For me, it happened on the pitch at a really bad moment. But, you know, over the course of 38 games, a lot happens for you and against you and that determines whether you win the league or not. But that happened at a really crucial time and I have to face that.

‘Football isn’t always going to be celebrations, highs and winning things and stuff like that. When you’re fighting for things at this level there are always going to be heartbreaks and disappointments and the last three months have been a massive disappointment, probably the worst of my life.

‘When you’re captain of this team, you can’t afford to feel sorry for yourself or mope around. Everyone in this group looks to me to see what sort of mood I’m in; to see how I am behaving round the place moving forward so I have to shake it off pretty quick.

‘And I will do. But I have to use it as a positive to drive me on. At 34 there is no possible way I am going to let the last three months be the things I remember moving forward. It’s important it finishes on a high.’

Close bond: Gerrard will be deployed as a 'quarterback' by manager Brendan Rodgers this season

As that moment was so dramatic, it has obscured how much Gerrard actually did to get Liverpool in a position to challenge Manchester City. His performances after he returned from a hamstring injury in January were exemplary, arguably as good as at any point during his stellar career.

He contributed 13 of Liverpool’s 101 Premier League goals, created another 15 and thrived in the deep-lying role Brendan Rodgers created for him. Rodgers has been raving on this tour of America how Gerrard will be his ‘quarterback’ and advancing years are no barrier to his importance.

There is, clearly, a bond between the captain and his manager and Rodgers was responsible for  providing the crucial advice when he came to make a decision about his England career.

Though he still feels he could influence Roy Hodgson’s team, ending his 114-cap career after the World Cup felt right. He and Liverpool will now reap the benefits and it will also allow him to spend time with his girls — wife Alex and their three daughters: Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes.

‘You sort of feel like you are lying to them all the time,’ Gerrard explains. ‘It’s difficult to say to them you are going away for four to six weeks. So you kind of lie and say you will only be gone a couple of weeks, then they are on the phone and on Facetime saying they want you home.

‘It does become difficult being away. I’ve done it for 14 years. I had to be fair to my family but also to Liverpool as well. To be fair to Brendan, when I had the chat with him, he said that if you want to carry on for England I can tailor your Liverpool games.

‘When I had the chat with him I was close to already knowing what I was going to do. When he said that my Liverpool games could be tailored then it made me go to 100 per cent with my decision because I don’t want my Liverpool games to be tailored.

‘I still want to be available, I want to be fresh and play at a high level for Liverpool for certainly one more season. We will have to wait and see if there are any more after that. I don’t feel like a weight has been lifted because I never saw it as a burden.

Reinforcements: Lazar Markovic has also been brought in from Benfica for £20m

‘I used to love going down there, knowing I was going to be captain. Of course I’m going to feel fresher and benefit from not playing.

‘I don’t feel as if I could go to a tournament at 36 and be who I wanted to be. Everything was pointing towards calling it a day but I’m going to miss it.’

He will not, however, be dwelling on it as there are big challenges ahead and the words from another emotional moment in April will be in his mind. After Liverpool had beaten Manchester City, who they face tonight in a friendly here, Gerrard gathered his squad together.

‘We go again, exactly the same,’ he implored, demanding that focus be retained. He will say the same over the coming weeks as he starts to dream about finally getting his hands on the trophy he has coveted all his life. His faith in a squad that has lost Luis Suarez is unshakeable.

‘That was real, it was from my heart,’ said Gerrard. ‘I was emotional at the time as we had just beaten City. We were so close. It was a reminder to everyone that there was still work to do and as it proved there was. But I’ll keep going and I will go again.

‘We are a good team with a good manager, that is getting stronger. The confidence is rising in the dressing room and we have got to show that we are the real deal. We are not there to just make up the numbers.’
