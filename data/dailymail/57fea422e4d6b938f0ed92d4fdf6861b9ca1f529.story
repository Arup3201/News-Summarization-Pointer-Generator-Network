Angry: Mario Balotelli at training this week. He has furiously denied a Mafia informant's claims that he had sold drugs to an addict 'as a joke'

Footballer Mario Balotelli has furiously denied a Mafia informant's claims that he had sold drugs to an addict 'as a joke.'

Balotelli, 22, was drawn into controversy after the supergrass gave evidence at a Mob money laundering trial.

Former gangster Armando De Rosa claimed the player had sold drugs as 'a joke' while in the company of senior gangsters.

But in a furious denial on Twitter Balotelli said: 'Ah..so now I'm a drug dealer. First I was a shag...Then maybe I took it up the a...You should be ashamed. You are using my name just to publicise yourselve' he wrote in a dig to prosecutors involved in the case.

Balotelli posted his response minutes after TV news reports emerged of De Rosa's claims during a trial in Naples, the heart land of the local Mafia known as the Camorra.

De Rosa had told the court: 'A friend called and said 'Would you like to see Balotelli' who was in Scampia (area of Naples). I thought it was a joke but he asked me to come and see him at a syringe exchange he had.

'Balotelli was there with members of the Russo and Amato-Pagano clams.

'Among them was a lad who was a dealer, he had a bag with doses of cocaine and heroin. I remember that Balotelli watched as a few deals tookÂ  place. Then for a joke he asked if he could do a sale.

'So he handed a dose to the next client. I remember asking him if he had recognised Balotelli but he didn't know what was happening or believe me.'

Balotelli's tweet was later removed from
 his account with Italian media reporting his new club AC Milan, where 
he moved to from Manchester City earlier this year, ordered him to.

Angry: In a furious denial on Twitter, Balotelli said: 'Ah..so now I'm a drug dealer. First I was a shag...Then maybe I took it up the a...You should be ashamed. You are using my name just to publicise yourselve.' He later deleted it

However Balotelli unleashed his anger yet again late last night on Twitter aiming his fury at a local TV station in Naples saying: 'Your newsroom should be closed down. Unless you apologise you will sweat the tears of my mother.'

Balotelli's visit to Naples where he was shown round by mobsters is said to have taken place in 2011 and he has admitted being there but insisted he left when he realised he was in a 'dangerous area.'

He has been questioned by prosecutors in connection with his visit but has never been charged with any offence or suspected of any wrongdoing.
