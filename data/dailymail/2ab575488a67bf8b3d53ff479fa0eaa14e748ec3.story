The number of toy-related injuries has increased nearly 60 percent in the past two decades - in large part due to the growing popularity of foot-powered scooters.

According to research by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Ohio, every three minutes in the U.S., a child is treated in an emergency department for an injury received playing with a toy. 

The data compiled from emergency room visit reports from 1990 to 2011 (the most recent year the data is available) showed more than 3.3 million children received urgent treatment for a toy-related accident.

Columbus hospital’s Center for Injury Research and Policy said this was in part down to the trend for scooters, which began in 2000.

The research shows that since they starting rising in popularity, a child has been treated in an emergency department every 11 minutes for an injury from a foot-powered scooter.

Children aged 5-17 years, are most likely to suffer injuries from riding toys including foot-powered scooters, wagons, and tricycles.

With their lightweight aluminium frame and tiny wheels — children place one foot on a board and use the other to propel themselves along — scooters can reach 25mph.  

The study says that injuries from riding toys are three times more likely to involve broken bones or dislocations than injuries from other toys.

'I've never seen anything like it in my career as a pediatric emergency room physician,' said Dr. Gary Smith, the study's lead author and director of the center, reports ABC.

'For the next two years the rate of scooter injuries spiked, dropped slightly until about 2005 and have been on the rise ever since,' Smith said, adding that skate board injuries have actually declined during the same time period. 

A survey compiled by a motor insurance company last year revealed that British death and serious injury rates for child pedestrians aged five and under were at their highest for ten years.

Research by Waikato University in New Zealand also found a five-fold rise in the number of injuries to children using mini-scooters over the past five years.

Mini-scooters weren’t originally designed for youngsters. 

The brainchild of Swiss inventor Wim Ouboter, they first became popular in 1998 among adult commuters in Tokyo. 

By 2000, the phenomenon had spread to Britain with celebrities such as Kylie Minogue owning one.

In the study injuries varied by age - for younger children the main hazards are choking on small toys or small parts of larger toys is the biggest risk.

Every day, 14 children are treated in a hospital for an injury they got from swallowing or inhaling a small toy or toy part.
