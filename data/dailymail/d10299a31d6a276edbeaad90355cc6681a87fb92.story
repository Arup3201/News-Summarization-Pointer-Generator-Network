A daredevil skier who filmed himself being towed by a train along a snowy railway track is being hunted by police in Poland.

Footage of the stunt shows the skier attaching himself to the back of the Polish railways train with a tow rope while passengers are getting on and off in a rural station.

And as the train accelerates away, the skier, believed to be a teenager, is seen disappearing at speeds estimated to be over 50mph.

Daredevil: A skier who filmed himself being towed by a train along a snowy railway track is being hunted by police in Poland

Tied on: The footage shows the skier being attached to the back of the train by a tow rope as it stops to let passengers on and off

The film has become a huge internet and media hit in Poland.

But police say the skier is facing court for his illegal activity.

'It is one of the most dangerous and idiotic stunts I have ever seen,' said a police spokesman.

'We are studying the footage to try and identify the location of the train and also the skier, we cannot let this sort of thing go unpunished or it will encourage others,' they added.

Set to a background of heavy rock music, the video shows what appears to be a crew of people preparing for the stunt at a section of the railway track.

The footage then cuts to a camera attached to the front of a person taking skiing equipment out of a car and making his way to a junction where a road meets the railway track.

He then positions himself behind a train which has stopped as a man ties a rope to the back of the carriage.

The train then sets off and pulls the skier along while he films the entire journey.

At one point, footage filmed from a car travelling alongside the train shows him skiing on one leg while being pulled along at speed by the train.
