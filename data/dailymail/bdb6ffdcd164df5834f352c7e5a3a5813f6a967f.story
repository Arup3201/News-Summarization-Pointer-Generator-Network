The 37-year-old cricketer couldn't believe he had won after ingratiated himself to Australian viewers

'That walk from the trial gate to here was one of longest walks of my life. I don't like insects, snakes, the dark…'

Reflecting on his experience in the camp he said: 'I've just tried to take everything out of it, no point moping around. I love meeting new people it's been nice.

'Friendships get accelerated in the camp, so I dropped my guard and spoke about things.

It came down to the English cricketer and AFL legend Barry Hall (R) who became good friends in the end

'I've spoken about my depression in the UK before, it's not something I'm ashamed of, it's something I do. I spent a lot of time hating myself.' 

Earlier in the program Flintoff, was unknowingly led to his wife and mother of this three children Rachael in an emotional reunion.

Gasping as he realised it was her, the two embraced as she ran to kiss him cupping his face.

'It was a bit embarrassing,' he later said. 'I must have stunk.'

'He stunk,' she later agreed, adding: 'But he's smelt worst before. It was so lovely to see him.' 

England's Ashes hero, who's time in the jungle saw him fall from  a helicopter, lock horns with Barry and bond with ten Australian strangers, was seen enjoying the final supper with funnywoman Chrissie Swan and Barry before the debut Australian series wrapped up.

AFL star Barry said everyone was a winner on the show for toughing it out in the jungle

AFL legend Barry, known for his insane tidiness, said: 'Let's have a toast to the finalist of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here everyone's a winner in my book. 

'The hardest thing was dealing with myself.'

Opening up about his private life he added: 'I know because I've got a deep voice and I stare at people intensely, they can take me wrong. People think Barry Hall, footballer, aggressive, physical. But I'm caring, I'm a very simple person.'

The affable cricketer willingly took on challenges without complaining and talked openly during the show

Barry, who split with his wife Sophie just prior to signing on for the show also admitted that he isn't proud of his newly single status. 

'Me and my wife wanted to have a break up, I don't want to be single at this age, but now I have a clearer picture of what I want to do.

'I lay in bed and thought I can now be happy with very little, with very basic stuff around me. I've learned to appreciate food, and loved ones. 

'I've really missed my loved ones, I've never missed anyone before. I've learned tolerance. I went though a dark time and came out the other side.'
