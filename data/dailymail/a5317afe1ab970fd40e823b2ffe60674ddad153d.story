Missing: Arthur Jones, 73, was last seen early last week on the Greek island of Crete

A British grandfather has gone missing on the Greek island of Crete during a hiking holiday.

Relatives of Arthur Jones, 73, are now desperately searching the island in an attempt to locate the keen adventurer after he failed to return to the UK last week.

The retired Welshman – described as a veteran Bear Grylls-style adventurer by his family – has been missing since June 19 after going into the Crete hills, where he planned to camp for a few days.

A major air and land search has been launched by the Greek Army, and helicopters are scouring the area near the resort of Chania where Mr Jones was last seen.

Mr Jones, from Denbigh, North Wales, arrived on Crete last Tuesday, and sent his family a postcard in the first few days, saying he was planning a walking trip.

The father-of-four has been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and had previously trained army cadets mountaineering and hill-climbing.

Speaking from Crete, his son Jeff is hoping British tourists may help find his father.

He said: ‘At the moment, the major problem for the authorities over here is pin-pointing an exact location.

‘We are looking for a positive sighting.

‘The area is so vast. I think that’s what’s taken us all a bit back really, now we’re here.

‘It’s not a small town. It’s not a small island. It’s huge, and there’s so many different areas where people go walking in.’

Mr Jones relatives have brought with them 1,000 leaflets in Greek and English, featuring the grandfather's picture, to hand out in the area.

Lost adventurer: Mr Jones, described by his family as a 'Bear Grylls-style' hiker, had told his family he was going to spend a few days camping in the hills near Chania

Jeff said: ‘In Greece they have what is called a silver alert and when the adverts are on TV a poster to help locate my dad is being shown.

‘There is a big search underway now and we know the army are helping and there have been helicopters up with thermal imaging equipment.

‘We received information that he may have been looking to go camping for a couple or a few days so he may have taken camping packs and have shelter to survive.’

Arthur was staying in the city of Chania, but has not been seen since 19 June.

Mr Jones said groups of walkers may remember seeing his father.

‘It stands out more if you see a stranger walking rough terrain, especially a 73-year-old man,’ he said.
