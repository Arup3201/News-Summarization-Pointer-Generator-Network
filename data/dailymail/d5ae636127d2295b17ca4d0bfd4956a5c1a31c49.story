A Florida resident who called 911 to report a violent home invasion on was directed to voice mail when a dispatcher tried to transfer the call from the fire department to law enforcement.

Unable to get a hold of police on time, the homeowner at Gwain Road in Port Richey in Pasco County grabbed a gun and shot one of the intruders who were apparently after cash and prescription pills.

WTSP reports that Joseph Rich, and brothers Michael Reverdes and Steven Reverdes are now in custody after police finally arrived on the scene. Steven Reverdes was shot in the back by the homeowner.

SCROLL DOWN FOR RECORDING

Joseph Rich, 31, allegedly entered a home on Wednesday to steal cash and prescription pills

Michael Reverdes, 31, was another one of the alleged intruders in Pasco County on Wednesday

Steven Reverdes, 33, was shot in the back by a homeowner when he allegedly broke in to steal cash and pills

'Hang up and call 911,' can be heard on this chilling recording of a homeowner calling the police for help when they are in danger.

The family screams in the background telling the robbers to leave the premises.

Apparently the phone was transferred to voice mail after the dispatcher tried moving the call from the fire department to law enforcement.

'somebody just came into my house, four people just came into my house, they beat the s**** out of me and my wife and my stepmother, then they robbed us, ' said the homeowner.

Police say that the suspects broke in the home in the middle of the night and fired shots at the homeowners, just inches away from a sleeping baby.

'The male inside said, I have a gun and will use it - the gun battle begins. They pistol-whipped the female and took a weapon and pointed it to the child and said they would kill the child if they don't get what they want,' said Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco.

Fox reports that the county released a timeline showing that officers where dispatched almost 4 minutes after the call but they said that this did nothing to slow their response time.

They said that they will take measures in their own hands to make sure nothing like this ever happens again but they didn't elaborate on those plans.

They said that this attack was a targeted one and that residents should not be concerned for their safety.

Three of the four robbers have been captured, including the man who was shot.

'I'm at a loss for words, had to protect my family,' the homeowner said about the incident.

The Mail Online contacted the Pasco County Police Department but no one was available for comment.
