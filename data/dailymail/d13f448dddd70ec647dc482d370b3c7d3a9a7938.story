Crystal Palace have never won a game at home in the Premier League in September, losing five and drawing four.

Sean Dyche admitted Burnley need to improve in the final third if they are to start winning in the Premier League.

They squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to get a first victory since returning to the top tier when Scott Arfield’s tame 84th-minute penalty was palmed away by Julian Speroni.

Julian Speroni's save meant that Burnley have still only scored once in their five games this season

Arfield, the scorer of his team’s only goal in five league and cup games this season, was given full backing by Dyche, who conceded there was a lack of ‘clarity and quality’ from his strike force.

‘It’s just small details,’ said Dyche. ‘That’s why the people at the front of the pitch usually drive the big cars and leave for about £50m, because they find ways of breaking teams down.’
