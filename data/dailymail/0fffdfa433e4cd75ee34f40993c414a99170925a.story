England fans upset at the FA for switching the extra loyalty value of attending matches from away games to Wembley will be infuriated at the way their appeal over the change has been ignored.

The FA intend to carry on regardless awarding two caps to their England club members for coming to home games and one cap for trips abroad. For years it had been the other way round for the loyalty league table that will next be used to allocate FA tickets for what will be a hugely over-subscribed Euro 2016.

England supporters have chanted their upset - ‘two caps for Wembley, you’re having a laugh’ - at every international game since the World Cup and the matter was raised by fans chief Malcolm Clarke at the last FA council meeting.

The FA board said they noted Clarke’s concern. But rather than look fully into whether they had made the right decision, the FA are staying on the same course.

They claim that the hardcore loyal support who go to home and away games are not being disadvantaged and that filling Wembley is the over-riding priority.

England fans ambassador Kevin Miles said: ‘We have appealed in the right way through our council representative and it will be disappointing in the extreme if our complaints are effectively ignored. The FA have not heard the last about this.’

Land Rover, who pulled their England rugby sponsorship after boorish behaviour by the players on a company day during the 2011 World Cup fiasco in New Zealand, have purposely made their tournament sponsorship in 2015 grass-roots related. Yet Land Rover still felt the need to spice up their launch match between two amateur sides at Farnborough Rugby Club by inviting along rugby celebrities Sir Clive Woodward, Jonny Wilkinson , Matt Giteau and Will Greenwood. And so much for grass-roots delivery — all the junior and mini-rugby sessions were cancelled so committee members could meet the big names.

Brian Cookson, the UCI president charged with cleaning up rotten cycling, faces a difficult day on Thursday. UCI’s licence commission meet to discuss his recommendation to withdraw leading team Astana’s elite competition licence following major doping offences by their riders.

Drug-riddled Astana are expected to take their case to the Council of Arbitration for Sport if they lose their permit. They will claim Cookson has not followed the correct legal procedure as there is nothing in the UCI statutes about withdrawing team licences for rider transgressions.

Potentially, Astana — backed by the Kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund — could then sue the UCI for massive damages if their appeal is upheld by CAS.

League One club Scunthorpe have tenuous links with the England team through being the first professional clubs of Kevin Keegan and Ray Clemence. And they are now in the unlikely position of having their chief executive of 10 days Jim Rodwell on the FA international committee. Rodwell was in Turin on Tuesday night as an FA representative.

Jevans’ RFU pay-off

The size of Debbie Jevans' six-figure pay-off from the RFU after walking out as chief executive of England Rugby 2015 points to Twickenham’s high command wanting her out — even if she made the first move.

It is understood the breakdown of Jevans’ relationships with the RFU leadership included those with affable chairman Bill Beaumont as well as chief executive Ian Ritchie.

It is said Jevans had been thinking about leaving since New Year, such was the disconnect. So there would have been time to ensure she did not depart Twickeham empty-handed and her believed £150,000 severance payment reflects tournament preparations going well.

The last big split before the Debbie Jevans affair in which both sides kept this quiet followed Adrian Chiles’ sacking as ITV’s lead football presenter. Chiles has still not spoken out about losing his prime sports host role to Mark Pougatch, despite having settled his pay-off terms with ITV.
