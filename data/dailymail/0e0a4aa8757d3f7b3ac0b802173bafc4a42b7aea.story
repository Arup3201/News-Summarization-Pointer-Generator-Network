May the odds be ever in their...wedding favor?

Hunger Games fans obsessed with Peeta's smoldering love for Katniss can embrace their inner geek with smoking 'Catching Fire'-themed nuptials.

David Lilly from Lilly and Lilly photography worked with a style team to dream up a Capitol-inspired ceremony which has it all: mockingjay pins, District-numbered tables and poison Nightlock berry spritzer.

Power to the people: Models Adel Travis and Andrew Johnson, wearing Jessica Rios of All Brides 2 Be and Formalwear outfits, make the three-fingered salute for a mock Hunger Games-themed wedding shoot

For most couples, organizing wedding seating is like a scene out of Hunger Games

Natalie Henry-Charles, from Pretty Peacock Planning which designed the tablescapes,  said the styled 'Love On Fire' shoot combined modern elements with a 'high-style glamorous Capitol perspective'.

'In
 the novel, the author alludes to Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark 
eloping... We imagined what the wedding would look like if the Capitol 
found out about the union and wanted to host an extravagant wedding for 
the couple,' she wrote for lillyandlillyphotography.com.

'Brides
 are taking more risks with their weddings and are creating customized 
weddings to suit their taste and aesthetic. This shoot was a 
representation of the modern bride.'

The
 theatrical wedding set-up also brought together globes of fiery-colored
 flowers, orbed with gold leaves which mimicked The Hunger Games 
Trilogy-inspired centerpiece, and over-the-top stationery with 
rhinestones in true Capitol fashion.

The Katniss-like model poses with 'poisonous berries from the wild Nightlock plant' - the berries Katniss and Peeta threatened to eat before they were saved in the first Hunger Games movie

This autumnal bouquet was pulled together by Heather Coscia of The Wild Hare Flowers
