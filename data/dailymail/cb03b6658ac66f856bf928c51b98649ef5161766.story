While Helen Flanagan struggles with the smallest of creepy crawlies in the jungle, model Cara Delevingne has put the squeamish actress to shame by posing with a tarantula on her face.

The 20-year-old model-of-the-moment is the cover girl of this month's i-D magazine, which was shot in London Zoo.

Wearing Sister by Sibling clothing with
neon hot pink eye-liner and bright pink hoop earrings Cara showed she had no fear by befriending the super-sized spider as well as a
lemur and a komodo dragon on the shoot.

The model follows in the footsteps of singer and new found friend Azealia Banks who recently posed for the magazine cover.

Each cover of i-D mag always features a wink or one eye completely covered, and this is the wildest concept to date.

When Karl Lagerfeld graced the cover he used an eye patch to convey a wink while
Kate Moss covered her eye with a super stylish blunt fringe.

The model, who recently walked in the annual Victoria's Secret show, gave her 130,000 Twitter followers a sneak peak of the shoot by tweeting pictures of her getting up close and personal with the animals.

Cara is just one of eight stars shot for the Wise Up i-D issue. Other cover stars include Lara Stone, Arizona Muse, Grace Coddington and Lena Dunham.
