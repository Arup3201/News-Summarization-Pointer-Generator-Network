Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group

Syria has said it is ready to cooperate with the international community to tackle Islamic State militants as it continues its civil war with various rebel groups.

Foreign minister Walid al-Moallem said his government was ready to work with any side, including Britain and the U.S., or join any regional or international alliance against the Islamic State group.

But he insisted any military action inside the country must be co-ordinated with Damascus, or else an attack would be considered as aggression.

Al-Moallen added that airstrikes alone will not be enough to eliminate extremists groups such as the Islamic State and the Nusra Front.

He called for 'drying up' their resources including cutting off funding and arming by regional state actors and private donations as well as controlling the borders and exchange of intelligence information.

America's top general last night said he will only recommend military action against Islamic State militants in Syria directly if they become a threat to the U.S. homeland.

General Martin Dempsey said that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff also said he believed key allies in the region, such as Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, will join the U.S. in its battle against the group.

Al-Moallem's remarks at a news conference in Damascus  marked the first public comments by a senior official of President Bashar Assad's government on the threat posed by the Islamic State group, which has captured large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian territory.

'Syria is ready to cooperate and coordinate on the regional and international level in the war on terror,' al-Moallem said. 'But any effort to combat terrorism should be coordinated with the Syrian government.'

He went on to say: 'Any strike which is not coordinated with the government will be considered as aggression.' 

President Barack Obama has resisted ordering U.S. military action in Syria for three years, even after a deadly chemical weapons attack a year ago near Damascus he blamed on President Assad's government. But now, Obama faces pressure from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State group inside Syria.

Obama remains wary, however, of getting dragged into the bloody and complex Syrian civil war that the United Nations says has killed more than 190,000 people.

Western authorities now fear the Islamic State 'caliphate' could be used as a launchpad for global terror attacks - fears that were increased following the beheading of American journalist James Foley last week.

An Islamic State video last week depicting the beheading of Mr Foley prompted revulsion in the West and calls for tougher action against the jihadists, including taking the fight to them in Syria as well as Iraq.

Some experts have suggested that attacking Islamic State in Syria should involve coming to some sort of arrangement with the government of President Assad, seen in the West as a pariah since an uprising against him began three years ago.

Last week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted that Britain will not 'align' itself with President Assad to defeat IS fighters.

Mr Hammond said Britain may have a 'common enemy' with the Syrian regime but added: 'That doesn't make us friends. It doesn't make us able to trust them, it doesn't enable us to work with them.'

His remarks came after Lord Dannatt, the former Chief of the General Staff, said it was impossible to fight Islamic State terrorists in Iraq while allowing them to retain their stronghold in bordering Syria.

The peer said Britain would eventually have to work with President Assad to defeat the insurgency by getting his approval for a bombing campaign in Syria.

During today's press conference, al-Moallem  said the Syrian government had repeatedly warned of the threat of terrorism and the need to cut off resources and funding but 'no one listened to us.' 

Syria's government has long described the rebels fighting to topple Assad as 'terrorists' in a foreign conspiracy.

U.S. officials revealed last week that U.S. forces had tried to rescue Mr Foley in a failed operation in Raqqa in July.

General Martin Dempsey said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe

'Had there been prior coordination that operation would not have failed,' al-Moallem said.

The minister also denounced 'in the strongest terms possible' Mr Foley's killing last week by Islamic State militants, while asking: 'Has the West ever condemned the massacres by the Islamic State and Nusra against our armed forces or citizens?'

Al-Moallem's news conference came a day after jihadis captured a major military air base in northeastern Syria, eliminating the last government-held outpost in a province otherwise dominated by the Islamic State group. 

After several failed attempts, Islamic State fighters stormed the Tabqa air base Sunday, killing dozens of troops inside.

Al-Moallem conceded defeat in Tabqa, saying that soldiers were withdrawn to nearby areas, along with their weaponry and warplanes inside the base.

The Islamic State group has established a self-declared caliphate in areas straddling Iraq and Syria's shared borders. The United States began airstrikes against the group in northern Iraq earlier this month which have helped the Kurdish peshmerga to reclaim some lost territory.

The United Nations meanwhile today condemned 'appalling, widespread' crimes by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including mass executions of prisoners that could amount to war crimes.

U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay condemned 'grave, horrific human rights violations' being committed by Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim group which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria to the alarm of the Baghdad government and its allies in the West.

Up to 670 prisoners from Badush prison in the city of Mosul were killed by Islamic State on June 10, Pillay said in a statement quoting survivors and witnesses to the 'massacre' as telling U.N. human rights investigators.

'Such cold-blooded, systematic and intentional killings of civilians, after singling them out for their religious affiliation, may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Pillay said.

Islamic State (ISIL) loaded 1,000 to 1,500 prisoners from the jail on to trucks and took them for screening, Pillay said. Sunni inmates were then separated and removed.

'ISIL gunmen then yelled insults at the remaining prisoners, lined them up in four rows, ordered them to kneel and opened fire,' she said.
