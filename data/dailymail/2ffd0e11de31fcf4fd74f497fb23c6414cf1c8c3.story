'Took two stun gun shots': Zane Thomas Gavin, 23, reportedly tried to carjack a deputy at 4:30am

A topless 23-year-old man reportedly tried to carjack a sheriff's deputy, soaked up two shots from a Taser and then brawls with back-up officers in a bizarre early-morning encounter.

Zane Thomas Gavin was arrested after a significant struggle at 4:30am early Saturday morning in Palm Harbor, Florida, in which he allegedly attacked several deputies and tried to steal a patrol car.

Gavin was spotted by deputy Richard Tipton running suddenly across a highway in the town, then seemingly getting knocked down by a passing SUV.

But when Tipton went to check on him, Gavin allegedly stood up and aimed a brutal punch at the officer's head, flooring the man and breaking his glasses.

Deputies said Gavin continued to beat Tipton, then got into his cruiser and started revving the engine as if to drive away, local station Bay News 9 reported.

The deputy was able to call for back-up, and tried to use his stun gun on Gavin , but the electric shock failed to bring him down.

The driver of the SUV, Sharon Scroggins, 59, tried to intervene and was also injured.

Describing the first moments of the encounter, she told Bay News: 'We just turned not too far down the road and this big huge guy with no shirt on, literally just his hands up and like he was diving, he went right in front of my car.'

An incident report said that Tipton's second shot with the weapon also had no immediate effect, but that Gavin got out of the car and then collapsed in the middle of the road again.

By this point, the report said, backup deputies had arrived and approached Gaving - who reportedly brawled with them as well.

They were eventually able to arrest him.

Gavin has now been charged with two counts of aggravated battery, violently resisting arrest, attempted carjacking.

Deputies said Tipon was left with a broken tailbone and damaged to his face and lip. Scroggins was taken to hospital with head injury, which was described as not being life-threatening.

Gavin was taken to hospital then booked into jail, as officers continue to investigate.
