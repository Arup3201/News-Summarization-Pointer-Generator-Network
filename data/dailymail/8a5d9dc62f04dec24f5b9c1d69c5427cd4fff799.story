Mauricio Pochettino might want to look up that old saying about houses built on sand. It might just ring a Christmas bell or two regarding a side who are reasonably capable of scoring but need some pointers on how to defend.

That much was obvious here in a performance of numerous back-line errors that had to be redeemed by goals 85 minutes apart.

Leading after four minutes through Harry Kane, Tottenham spent large swathes of what remained hanging on. Had Wilfried Bony made more of the space he was repeatedly afforded by Federico Fazio, this might have been a different result altogether.

Instead, Bony scored only once and Tottenham rode a Swansea storm until Christian Eriksen picked their pocket at the other end. As Swansea manager Garry Monk put it: ‘It would have been stopped in the second half if it was a boxing match.’

Pochettino, meanwhile, was asked if there was a Spanish phrase for ‘smash and grab’, but he didn’t understand the question.

Instead he focused on the ‘positives’, which in this case meant a first win in three league games and a tribute to the team’s spirit. Certainly, there was no shortage of application from Tottenham’s players when the going got tough and that has not always been the case in this strange season.

Pochettino said: ‘We showed character. It was a difficult game because Swansea are a very good team. It is important to show character and fight. It was a very, very important win because Swansea have very good players.’

He added: ‘In football, sometimes you deserve it and sometimes not. I think we deserved it because we scored. Sometimes in the last few games, we deserved more but didn’t score. This is football.’ 

Monk was not nearly so philosophical, lamenting the lack of clinical finishing up front and the errors from Angel Rangel and Jazz Richards that led to Tottenham’s two goals. 

He said: ‘It’s sickening. I couldn’t see that coming, to be honest. Two individual errors cost us two goals and the result. We created enough chances to score a number of goals and didn’t do it.

‘We gifted them the first and the second half it was one way until we made another mistake for the goal.In the second half they were hanging on. That is when you have to kill people. You have to be ruthless.’

Of those errors, the first came inside four minutes. The origins were questionable, a debatable foul given against Jefferson Montero on Swansea’s left from which Tottenham won a corner. 

Eriksen delivered the cross and Kane headed his 10th goal of the season.

A fine tally, certainly, but helped generously in this instance by some flat-footed marking from Rangel, who was similarly lacking in defeat against West Ham last week.

The retaliation started soon after and Pochettino ought to be concerned about the opportunities his side gave up. 

There’s no doubt that Bony’s movement has improved this season, but a man of his build should not find it so easy to escape detection from centre halves. At times, Fazio and Jan Vertonghen were clueless in plotting his location.

The first sign came on nine minutes when the Ivorian turned inside Fazio and drew a good save from Hugo Lloris. Bony then got away from Vertonghen to meet a superb through-ball from Montero. 

The striker was clean through but Ben Davies’s slide tackle was a perfect mixture of timing and technique. The left-back tussle with Danny Rose looks to have been won. 

Bony was twice more given space to threaten and Gylfi Sigurdsson had a shout for a penalty ignored after an apparent foul by Fazio. Monk said: ‘I asked the fourth official if their player touched the ball. I don’t think he did.’ 

Spurs were living dangerously and the pressure told soon after the break. Again, Fazio was guilty of allowing Bony to meet Wayne Routledge’s cross eight yards out. The initial shot came back off Fazio and Bony buried the rebound for his eighth of the campaign.

From there, Sigurdsson dragged a low shot wide, while Jonjo Shelvey and Montero also went close. Kane glanced a header within a foot of the far post after an Eriksen corner, but Spurs were mostly countering rather than setting a pace.

Then the sucker punch. Richards made a hash of a clearance in the 89th minute, Davies squared and Eriksen finished from the edge of the area. ‘Christian is still young — 22 years old,’ Pochettino said. ‘It is his second season in England and he is a big talent and a very key player for us.’

That much is not in doubt. It’s what happens a little further back that ought to be the concern.
