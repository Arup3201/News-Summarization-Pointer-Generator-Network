A 13-year-old boy was seriously injured after being attacked by a dog as he visited his cousin.

The boy was reportedly dragged downstairs by the animal while visiting a relative yesterday and attacked in the kitchen of the terrace house in the Little Horton area of Bradford, West Yorkshire.

Police were called to the house at 7.26pm yesterday and had to shoot the animal so paramedics could treat the boy, who suffered serious neck injuries and has been named locally as Luca.

Horrific: The boy was reportedly dragged downstairs by the animal while visiting a relative yesterday and attacked in the kitchen of the terrace house in the Little Horton area of Bradford, West Yorkshire

During the ten-minute attack, 
the dog is believed to have dragged him down stairs and into the 
kitchen, while people nearby tried to rescue him as he shouted: ‘I’m 
going to die, I’m going to die.’

At the end-of-terrace house where a 
13-year-old boy was attacked by a dog, two men and a woman 
appeared to be cleaning today.

They
wore blue rubber gloves and carried mops and buckets into the house, as
well as putting black liners full of rubbish into bins. Later, one of 
them took their other dog, Coco, for a walk.

Asked
what had happened, one of the men claimed the teenager, named as Luca, was 
antagonising the dog. He said: ‘We only got the dog on Friday, we didn’t
know what it was like.

‘It 
was an American Bulldog called Patch. Luca had come round on Sunday and 
was teasing the dog, provoking it. I told him to stop it, but he 
didn’t.’

Location: The incident happened on Frank Street in the Little Horton area of Bradford, West Yorkshire

House: A man leans out of his upstairs window at the property in Bradford where the boy was attacked

One person on the street said there was ‘blood everywhere’ in the property after the attack.

Man at house

Two women who live nearby said the 
alarm was raised when a girl who was also at the house ran to the door 
screaming. One of the women told how her partner tried to help the boy. 

She
said: ‘I’ve heard that the boy was upstairs and the dog managed to get 
upstairs somehow. The dog was just attacking him and there were two 
girls there. They were just screaming and shouting.

‘They
thought the dog might be trying to get them too. Dean, my partner, went
in and heard what was happening. He saw the little boy lying on the 
floor and the dog was attacking him.

‘He didn’t know what to do, so he hit the dog with a shovel just to try and get him off the little boy and he started kicking him. The dog kept on going back to the boy who was trying to get away.

Witness

‘The little boy managed to drag himself upstairs. He was crying and was saying, “I’m going to die, I’m going to die”. Dean said to him, “Get upstairs and shut that door”. Luckily he managed to do that.

‘When he got upstairs he was dizzy and his eyes were all over the place,’ the woman said, adding that the boy then passed out. ‘Dean didn’t even let the police in, he shoved them out.

‘He said, “You don’t want to be in there”. The police shot the dog twice so that they could get in. They couldn’t get upstairs with it there. The little boy was in danger. Even the police said if it wasn’t for Dean, the boy could be dead.’

Response: A police community support officer stands with his bicycle near where the dog attack happened

The woman, who reported the attack and did not wish to be named, said that the dog had been given to a family on the road, Frank Street, just two or three days earlier.

'Dean' was labelled a 'real hero' by one neighbour. And Katrina Green, who lives nearby, said she heard sirens and other commotion in the street and did not know what was happening.

'The police shot the dog twice so that they could get in. They couldn’t get upstairs with it there'

Witness

‘We thought it was a murder at first,’ 
she said, ‘or that it was a fight. I'm really shocked. It's not the 
dog's fault, it's how they bring them up.’

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said the incident was being investigated and confirmed that the dog, whose breed has not been confirmed, had been shot dead.

A police statement said: ‘The child was then taken to Leeds General Infirmary where his condition is this morning described as stable, with injuries which are not believed to be life threatening.

'Enquiries are now ongoing as to the breed of the dog and to establish whether any criminal offence has been committed.’
