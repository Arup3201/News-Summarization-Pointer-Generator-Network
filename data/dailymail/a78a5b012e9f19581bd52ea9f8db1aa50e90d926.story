The number of pet animals poisoned and high on marijuana is growing higher, veterinarians say.

California Bay Area-based veterinarians told KTVU on Tuesday more pets are being rushed to animal emergency rooms severely ill and high on the drug. The rise in emergency cases coincides with the rise of medical marijuana, they said.

Rick Benjamin from the Berkeley Dog and Cat Hospital told KTVU that marijuana toxicity is more common in dogs than cats.

The rise in California medical marijuana has been linked to an increase in ER visits for pet animals, who may accidentally be poisoned eating baked goods containing THC, like in these file photos

'They're making cookies and crackers and cakes that are fairly potent in marijuana, and the dogs in particular love that,' he said.

He said that the main problem is that the small animals have to metabolize large quantities of the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.

'We're seeing more I think for a number of reasons, probably one is the potency of the THC in the marijuana has increased, so that the animal consuming the pot gets more of the active drug,' Benjamin said.

Benjamin told KTVU that animals need to have their stomachs pumped to filter the marijuana out of their bodies. Most animals recover -- but in rare cases it can be fatal.

Symptoms of poisoning in pets can occur within 30 - 60 minutes of exposures, Michigan Live reports. They include stumbling, dilated pupils, vomiting, and glassy eyes.

Other serious side effects, Michigan Live reports, include changes in heart rate, coma, tremor and seizures.

The rise in pot poisoning cases in pet animals in not happening just in California. The Huffington Post reports that a 5-year study in Colorado found that pot poisoning in dogs quadrupled after the state legalized marijuana in 2000.

Some have claimed that medical marijuan could be beneficial for pet animals. The Daily Mail reported in 2011 that Medical Marijuana Systems LLC had licensed a patent for Tetracan, a 'pot patch' meant to serve as pain relief for animals.
