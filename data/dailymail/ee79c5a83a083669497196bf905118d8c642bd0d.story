An armed man has surrendered himself to police following a five-hour siege in which he allegedly held a woman and a baby - who is believed to be her child - captive inside a Queensland home.

Police were called to a disturbance at a Larkin Court property in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, about 10.30am on Thursday.

They then spent the next three to four hours negotiating with a 37-year-old man who was inside the house.

A man has been arrested by police following a siege in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, on Thursday

He had been holding a baby captive for almost five hours. A woman was also held hostage but she escaped

During this time, police believe a warning shot was fired near the Caboolture woman causing an injury to her ear, Nine News reported.

But later the woman was seen escaping and running away from the residence - leaving the child with the man.

The Courier Mail reported the woman had blood smeared on her body and was heard yelling: 'He's found me'.

The man, who surrendered to police about 3pm, is expected to be charged with a number of offences - including assault occasioning bodily harm, possession of a firearm and deprivation of liberty.

A Queensland Police Service spokesman confirmed the woman suffered a laceration to the back of her head.

It is believed she was assaulted by the man during her time inside the house.

Larkin Court was placed in lock down about 12pm and residents were required to remain inside their homes.

Footage showed the man walking out of the house, holding the baby and acting erratically before eventually surrendering to police by laying on the ground.

A female police officer took the child from the man's grasp while heavily armed police surrounded him in the middle of the deserted suburban street.

The Queensland Police spokesman said the woman and child were taken to Caboolture Base Hospital, but the child did not suffer any injuries.

The man is yet to be identified and police are still unable to confirm his relationship with the child.
