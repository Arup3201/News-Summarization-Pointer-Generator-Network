Accused: Jamie Geer is alleged to have abused the teenager from an early age

A teenager has told a court how a former fire chief sexually molested her in return for lavish gifts during a near decade-long period of abuse.

Jamie Geer, former fire chief in Clearwater, Florida, allegedly sexually abused the girl when she was in elementary school in return for shoes, clothes and even lingerie.

A court was yesterday told that the girl, now 19, was even taken to fore conventions by Geer when he was Clearwater fire chief.

The victim told a jury at Pinellas 
County Courthouse in Clearwater that Geer began to talk to her about sex
when she just seven years old.

She
claimed that just a year later, she was forced into the first of 
hundreds of sex acts, before buying her silence with a string of 
extravagant gifts.

The court heard that Geer, 58, also bought her lingerie and made her pose in sexual positions.

During
her two hour testimony yesterday, she said: 'Anything that he bought 
me, he would get a sexual favor for. If you buy me this, I will trade 
you and give you this.'

After
being asked what items she traded sexual favours for, she replied: 
'Cell phone, purses, Coach purses, shoes, clothes,' according to MyFox Tampa Bay.

The fire chief also recorded some of sexual incidents with a video camera, and made her pose in provocative positions in a hotel room, it is alleged.

When she turned 15 Geer allegedly began having sex with her, the same year the teenager began a physical relationship with her high school boyfriend.

Her partner got her pregnant, and it was at this point that she told a family member of the abuse she had suffered at the hands of Geer.

Trial: Geer, pictured in court yesterday, has denied the allegations but could be jailed for life if convicted

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement began investigating Geer after an anonymous tip, and arrested the former fire chief in December 2010.

While being cross examined, the teenager admitted moving in with Geer after she had her baby, and continuing a sexual relationship with him.

Geer faces three counts of Capital Sexual Battery, and faces life in jail if convicted.

The trial, which is expected to finish on Thursday, continues.
