Dozens of dementia patients were moved out of a nursing home in their pyjamas after regulators branded it ‘dangerous’ and shut it down at short notice.

In chaotic scenes, pensioners were carried out in the freezing night to waiting ambulances after they were deemed ‘at significant risk of harm’.

Patients and their families were given just a few hours’ notice before police and paramedics arrived to move the patients out of Merok Park Care Home.

It was reported that staff at the care home were working up to 60 hours per week and that they had not been given relevant training. A recent care quality inspection found that residents were being washed in cold water

The Care Quality Commission ordered its immediate closure after finding elderly patients in filthy conditions and forced to wash in cold water by untrained staff.

Inspectors also described an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine at the care home in Banstead, Surrey – which charges up to £500 a week.

Shocked families were told about the emergency move on Tuesday morning and some arrived at the home with bin liners to pack up their loved ones’ belongings.

As darkness fell, there was chaos as pensioners were carried from their beds in nightclothes to be transported to other homes.

Some were left shivering by the front door in wheelchairs with blankets around their necks as they waited, while one confused woman – who did not appear to have any relatives – was left all day in the corner of the lounge.

Families also complained they were left without information on when transport would arrive.

The closure comes despite the home being given a clean bill of health in January by the watchdog – and despite numerous complaints from relatives going back years.

Leslie Shields, 53, whose father was among those moved out, said: ‘The home was a pigsty. My father’s health has really gone downhill there. I think they’ve been cutting corners when it comes to staff.

‘I’ve complained to the council on numerous occasions about the concerns I had, but they just seemed to file the documents away and do nothing.

‘But the worst was moving all those elderly people out on one of the coldest, windiest nights of the year. It was awful for them.’ 

Another relative, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The thing that makes me angry is that the home passed its CQC inspection in January. The care hasn’t got worse since then – it’s always been that bad. How can they have passed it 11 months ago and now be shutting it down?’ 

The CQC said it carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1 and, after the visit, it was decided that the care facility had to close immediately. Patients were moved immediately

There were other questions last night over why elderly people were ever placed in the care home by Surrey County Council, which was damned by a coroner this year over the death of a dementia patient.

Gloria Foster, 81, died when she was left without food and medication for nine days after the care agency which visited her daily was shut down by immigration officers.

The CQC said it had taken ‘urgent’ action to remove registration from Merok Park after a range of safety concerns. Inspectors found its 29 residents were not being helped to eat and some were confined to the top floors because of a broken lift.

Some staff had neither passed police checks nor received ‘relevant training’ and worked up to 60 hours a week.

The residents have now been re-housed by the local authority in different care homes.  

Adrian Hughes, chief inspector of adult social care in the south for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), confirmed the health and social care services regulator had taken action because of the 'significant risk of harm' to residents.

He said: 'We have taken urgent action to remove CQC registration from Merok Park Nursing Home in Banstead, Surrey, because of concerns that the people living there are at significant risk of harm.

'CQC does not take enforcement action lightly given the obvious impact on people who live in nursing and residential care homes, but in this case we – and other agencies locally – felt that the home was unsafe.

'We made the providers aware of our concerns some time ago, but action has not been taken to maintain the safety and welfare of people.' 

Mr Hughes confirmed that the CQC carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1, after receiving concerns about the level of care provided.

He said: 'We identified a number of serious issues with the care provided at Merok Park.

'We saw that people living in the home were not being appropriately supported by staff, and witnessed some incidents of poor manual handling. 

'People were being washed in cold water, there was a high risk of people developing pressure sores due to inappropriate beds.

'People were not supported to eat, and the home was dirty. The smell of urine in the home on the first day of the inspection was overpowering.

'Some staff working in the home had not had criminal records checks, and staff were working up to 60 hours a week.

'There has been neglect': Leslie Shields

A furious son has described how he complained ‘hundreds’ of times about the state of Merok Park and its treatment of his father.

Leslie Shields, 53, said he and relatives repeatedly confronted the home and Surrey County Council officials about the standard of care.

His father – also called Leslie, 78 – entered the home six years ago with dementia after suffering several falls and some memory loss.

But over the years the family began to worry about conditions at the Surrey centre. Mr Shields described it as a ‘hovel’ and complained of a bad smell throughout, saying there were so few staff that it was difficult to arrange health appointments.

He claimed his father was left to soil himself and had blisters and sores all over his legs caused by ‘poor hygiene’. The family said they were ignored by the council after repeated complaints – and despite filling out formal questionnaires and filing letters to an NHS commissioning body.

‘We’ve been telling social services for years... and ramped up our efforts in the last two years,’ he said. ‘Each time, nothing was done. We feel there has been neglect at the home.’

'There were not enough staff on duty, and relevant training had not been provided.

'A broken lift had left some people unable to get downstairs in the home for several weeks.' 

Mr Hughes said the decision to move the residents from the home was made in their best interests.

He said: 'Taking any decision which causes people to leave their homes is always difficult at any time of year – but it is our view, shared by other agencies, that it was no longer safe for people to remain in Merok Park.

'The level of concerns we had here were rare, and robust action was needed.

'The local authority and the CCG are in the process of moving people to other services, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.' 

Merok Park is run by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, who also run the Faygate House care home in Sutton. That was criticised earlier this year by the CQC for failing to store the residents’ records properly.

The couple, who own a £1.3million home in nearby Cheam, were unavailable to comment yesterday.

Merok Park passed an inspection in January even though there were ‘concerns’ during a visit in September last year.

That inspection found that residents were ‘generally satisfied’ but a report said the home had ‘not always taken steps to provide care in a home that was adequately maintained in all areas’.  

Surrey Police confirmed officers assisted with the closure of the home.

A spokesman said: 'Uniformed officers assisted with the closure of a care home in Banstead following a request by the Care Quality Commission.

'The closure, which involved several partner agencies, took place on Tuesday.'

MailOnline has contacted Mr and Mrs Cooppen for comment.
