Smiling and clapping enthusiastically, Gary Speed looks happy and upbeat as he and wife Louise cheer on friend Robbie Savage in the Strictly Come Dancing studio.

The couple were the very image of contentment in the audience as they applauded and gasped in delight during Savage's performance with dance partner Ola Jordan.

The images are even more poignant since they were captured just weeks before the football hero was found hanged at his home. His body was discovered by Louise last Sunday morning.

Support: Speed is seen giving Savage a high-five after his routine. His upbeat appearance in the studio makes his death last weekend all the more puzzling

This picture is thought to be the last time the couple were photographed in public before his untimely death in an apparent suicide.

His appearance on Strictly was also the last time that Savage saw his former Wales colleague and close friend.

Savage, 36, has now vowed to dedicate his performance on tomorrow 
night's show in memory of the Welsh legend.

He promised to deliver a polished routine which would 'make Speedo proud', he announced on Twitter.

He posted: 'So
hard to concentrate on dancing this week. Head’s all over the place. 
Going to be so emotional, the last place I seen Speedo was in studio. 
I’m going to make him proud of his mate.'

He added: '(Gary) loved Strictly. My performance is for him, still stunned!'

The last time Savage saw his friend was in
the Strictly studio on October 22, when 42-year-old Speed and his wife 
Louise, 41, sat beaming in the audience.

'Still in shock': Robbie Savage has dedicated his performance to friend Speed

When Savage's routine with Ola Jordan was over, the couple gave him a standing ovation and Speed gave his friend a high-five.

Savage,
who is in the final six in the BBC1 show, posted a picture of Speed 
sitting in the front row of Strictly.

He tweeted: 'This was just 4 weeks ago – great picture me and Speedo doing a hi 5 !!'

A tearful Savage said of Speed  in an interview for BBC News last Sunday: ‘He had a caring, loving family and was doing great 
at his job. Why has this happened? It’s the most incredible news I’ve 
heard in my lifetime.'

He added: 'I spoke to him yesterday 
morning and we had a good chat, we were laughing and joking. He had been
to Strictly Come Dancing three or four weeks ago with his wife.

'After
my routine I high-fived him and afterwards we had a few drinks. I spoke
to him yesterday and he was in high spirits. I can’t believe it.'

In his column for the Daily Mirror this week, Savage wrote: 'I laughed with Gary Speed, got drunk with him, cried with him on a couple of occasions.

'This week I have been crying on my own. I still can't believe what has happened and I will never, ever understand it.

'Strictly Come Dancing has been great for me for so many reasons but the thing I'm so grateful for is that now I will always have a picture in my head of Gary smiling in the front row when he came to the show a few weeks ago.

'So thanks, Strictly. And thank you for everything, Gary.'
