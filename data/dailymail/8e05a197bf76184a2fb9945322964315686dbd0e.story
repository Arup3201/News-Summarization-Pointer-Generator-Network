 we must inform the Taft community of the passing of one of our 
students. Erik Lucansky was tragically struck by a train and killed 
while crossing the tracks at Bryn Mawr and Avondale on his way to 
school.

Grief counselors have been made available in the school and are

Erik's family our deepest sympathy in this time of sorrow.'

The Chicago Tribune spoke to a mother of one of the boy's friend's, Rose Bates.

'He was a fun-loving kid,' said Bates.

'He was nice kid, very polite, quiet when he was around here. He seemed to have a good head on his shoulders,' she said.

Her daughter who was shocked by the death decided to stay at the school and speak with one of the grief counselors. Bates had gone to the school to see if her daughter was overwhelmed and wanted to go home

This is not the first time a 17-year-old has been struck by a Metra train on their way to the Taft School.
