Ed Miliband was left red-faced last night after voters rejected his boast that he is ‘more intelligent’ than David Cameron.

According to a Mail on Sunday poll, the Prime Minister is seen as more than twice as intelligent as the Labour leader, who is lagging behind UKIP’s Nigel Farage in the brainbox ratings.

Even more embarrassing, Miliband is regarded as ‘thicker, wetter and more sexless’ than Cameron, the Lib Dems’ Nick Clegg and Farage.

David Cameron was described in the poll as cruel, bullying and phoney

The ‘political insults poll’ was 
commissioned by this newspaper after a week in which Miliband launched a
 provocative twin assault on the Conservatives.

He argued he is ‘more 
intellectually self confident’ than Cameron and followed it up with a 
Labour TV broadcast that portrayed the PM as rich, uncaring and out of 
touch, and Clegg as his feeble puppet.

However, the Survation poll suggests Miliband may have been better advised to heed the adage about people in glass houses and stones.

Asked to judge the four main leaders on ten less than flattering character traits, Miliband comes top in three – ‘thick’, ‘wet’ and ‘sexless’.

Cameron hardly has anything to shout about, with first place in the five categories of ‘cruel’, ‘remote’, ‘phoney’, ‘sanctimonious’ and  ‘bully’.

Deputy Prime Minister Clegg is seen as more ‘naïve’ than the others, while Farage is the most ‘cocky’. Asked who is the most ‘intellectually self confident’, Cameron wins by a country mile on 33 per cent, with Farage on 16, Miliband 14 and Clegg a meagre six. A total of 31 per cent of those polled didn’t know.

A total of 17 per cent said Miliband is ‘thick’ with Cameron seen as ‘least thick’ of the four on nine per cent. Asked which leader is most ‘wet’, Miliband comes top again, on 27 per cent, with Clegg on 25, Cameron 13 and Farage seven.

A total of 19 per cent say the Labour leader is ‘sexless’ with Farage on 12, Cameron 11 and Clegg nine, making the Lib Dem leader the sexiest of the four.

Cameron’s ‘cruel’ image will do little to help him shed the ‘Nasty Party’ tag that has dogged the Tories. And the perception of him as a ‘remote bully’ has echoes of his membership of Oxford’s notorious Bullingdon Club in his student days.

However, Tory MP friends of the Prime Minister said he could draw some comfort from the findings.

One said: ‘Given the choice of being seen as a hard b****** or a wet rag, most leaders would choose the former. Margaret Thatcher may not have been loved by millions, but millions voted for her because they respected her.’

Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was described by those who completed the questionnaire as naive

If the key to winning the next Election is to convince the electorate you are a ‘nice guy’, Miliband may have the last laugh. A tiny five per cent regard him as a ‘bully’ and six per cent as ‘cruel’, compared to 25 and 18 for Cameron respectively.

The two highest individual scores in the survey go to Clegg and Farage. One in three say the UKIP leader is ‘cocky’, with 28 per cent stating Clegg is ‘naïve’.

But Cameron’s big lead in brainpower has failed to overhaul Labour, which remains at the top of the poll to win the next Election on 33 per cent, with the Tories five points behind on 28, UKIP on 20 and the Lib Dems 10.

lSurvation interviewed 1,005 people online on Friday and Saturday.

Potential voters described the UKIP leader Nigel Farage as 'cocky'

Ed Miliband opened up an aggressive new front in his class war against the Government last week, using a controversial party political broadcast to portray the Prime Minister and his Cabinet as privileged, out-of-touch toffs.

Miliband, who is considered to be a member of Labour aristocracy as the son of celebrated Marxist academic Ralph, lives in a £2.4 million North London home and has an estimated joint annual income of £350,000 with his barrister wife Justine.

And what about the rest of his team?
