Virgin Atlantic has lost 'millions' during the first six months of its new domestic service with flights just one-third full on average.

The Little Red service, which provides flights from London to Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, has had nearly 300,000 passengers since starting earlier this year. It is estimated the planes therefore would have been about a third full.

Virgin Atlantic however has said its 
business plan allowed for the 'low load factors' and said the flights 
were contributing to the overall business plan by connecting passengers 
to its long haul network.

The company started flying from Heathrow to Manchester in March while links to Edinburgh and Aberdeen began in April.

According to The Independent, industry insiders believe losses for the network could be in the region of between £2m and £3m a week. It is understood the airline disputes this figure.

Losses on domestic flights can be sustained by airlines if they supply passengers to its intercontinental network.

A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'With the launch of Little Red, Virgin Atlantic is offering millions of passengers a strong alternative for domestic flights and renewed choice for connections to the rest of our long haul network, and it is those connections which means Little Red is contributing to a robust business model that will protect competition to and from Heathrow for the long-term.

'As with any new route it takes time for customers to become fully aware of our service and it is normal to have comparatively low load factors in the first six months of operation. 

'Our business plan allowed for this. 
Bookings for future travel continue to grow steadily and our recent 
connecting revenue performance has beaten our expectations.

'We are fully committed to all of our domestic routes and believe our great reputation for service and value for money will continue to attract passengers to Little Red.'

The aircraft used by Virgin Atlantic for its Little Red service in fact belong to Aer Lingus, who 'wet-lease' the planes and crews to Virgin and get paid regardless of how many people use the routes.

Virgin Atlantic said the average number of passengers was rising as the airline built up its domestic operation.

Sir Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group and President of Virgin Atlantic said: 'Little Red is a British business giving a better deal to British passengers.

'On routes where previously customers in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Manchester had a “choice” of one, there is now a strong alternative and we are shaking up a monopoly market.

'We are doing so with a full service, a great schedule and at exceptionally good value for money. 

'There have been challenges as there would be for any new business, but we do not shy away from these – in fact they are what the Virgin entrepreneurial spirit is all about.

'Bookings are growing steadily with passengers from around the globe connecting onto Little Red flights and we know they will continue to do so.'
