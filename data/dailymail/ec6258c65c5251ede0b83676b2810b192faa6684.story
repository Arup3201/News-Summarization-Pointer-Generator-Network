Former Daily Mail cartoonist Dick Millington, whose work enthralled and amused generations for more than half a century, has died at the age of 81.

The lifelong illustrator won an international audience with characters that ranged from curmudgeonly George Damper in the Mail’s ‘I Don’t Believe It’ strip, to the celebrated Mighty Moth, an insect whose adventures appeared in TV Comic for 25 years.

Mr Millington, who wrote most of his storylines as well as illustrating them, also supplied the Mail’s long-running Guinness Book of Records feature until the late 1990s.

He was inspired as a child by superhero and other comics from America – and created his own characters and stories to sell to classmates at a penny a time.

At the age of 14 he got a job providing the hand-written lettering for cartoon balloons – but quickly displayed a talent for inventing and drawing his own strips.

Mighty Moth was born in 1959, six years after Mr Millington completed National Service in the RAF. 

It spawned a cartoon portfolio that came to include characters such as Ray Presto, Jolly Roger and the Moonbeans.

Millington was also the artist who transported TV’s Basil Brush to comic strip format, and who illustrated a children’s book by Animal Magic television presenter Johnny Morris.

Although George Damper bore striking similarities to grumpy Victor Meldrew in BBC TV’s One Foot in the Grave, ‘I Don’t Believe It’ was not the original title for Millington’s comic strip and he had never seen the programme when he created it.

His son Stephen said yesterday George was simply one of the ‘many, many figures’ he invented from a combination of real life and imagination.

Mr Millington died on Wednesday at his home in Kent after an illness, leaving a wife, three children and a grandson – plus, of course, a family of cartoon characters that had the advantage of never ageing.
