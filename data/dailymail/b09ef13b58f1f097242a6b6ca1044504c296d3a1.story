A search for the remains of King Harold is due to be carried out at a church in Waltham Abbey in Essex

Tradition has it his body was cut to bits after he was killed by an arrow in the eye at the Battle of Hastings.

But nearly 1,000 years on, a search is being carried out for the remains of King Harold at a church in Waltham Abbey, Essex. 

The project will be charted by Oval Films, which also helped to find Richard III’s remains in a car park in Leicester.

It will follow amateur historian Peter Burke, who has written two historical novels on the times of Harold, and claims the king was wounded but survived.

He believes he died 30 years later and was buried near the east wall of the former abbey that dates to the late 11th century.

A stone monument to the king stands in the grounds, although not where the search is taking place. 

Mr Burke, a stonemason who has spent years researching his theory at the British Museum and British Library, is sponsoring a £2,000 search of the site using ground penetrating radar. A film crew are recording the work.

He said: ‘I am convinced Harold survived the Battle of Hastings.

‘If we find the complete remains of an old man in his late 70s with scarring to his temple from a battle wound then we need to do a DNA test.’

David Hatton, of Oval Films, added: ‘We are very excited by the whole concept that there is another, even more plausible, story to the life and times of King Harold.

‘If we find what we are hoping then this could change history.’

Anglo-Saxon rule over England ended in 1066 when the Norman invaders arrived, led by William the Conqueror.

But some believe Harold fled England or lived out his life as a hermit at Chester or Canterbury.

There have also been a variety of claims about his resting place, including at Bosham Church in West Sussex.

The search in Essex was due to begin on Tuesday but has been delayed for a fortnight while the team wait for a licence to be issued by English Heritage.

Historians remains sceptical about the chances of finding Harold’s remains, however, with one describing them as ‘extremely minute’.

Chris Sumner, chairman of Waltham Abbey Historical Society, said: ‘The site that they will searching for the remains has been disturbed so many times by building works that it will prove very unlikely that the remains will be located.’

The remains of Richard III were discovered under a car park in Leicester last year.

Earlier this year archaeologists excavating from the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great or his son, Edward the Elder.
