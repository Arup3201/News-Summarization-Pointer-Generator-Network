Supermarkets have been accused of fuelling an obesity crisis with ‘irresponsible’ promotions on sugary junk food.

Discounts and buy one, get one free deals are skewed towards unhealthy products, according to a study.

Prices and nutrition data across 6,000 food and drink items sold over a year by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Ocado were analysed by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School.

Fuelling obesity: Researchers claim buy one, get one free deals are geared towards unhealthy foods

Professor Paul Dobson, head of the business school, said: ‘We found a bias towards sugary products for price promotions and that straight price discounts are on average more skewed towards unhealthy products.’

A snapshot survey yesterday found, for example, that Tesco has a £1 offer on boxes of Maltesers and tubes of Cadbury Fair Trade Buttons and Smarties, and price drops of up to 50 per cent on Terry’s Chocolate Orange,  Cadbury Roses, Thorntons and Quality Street products.

Asda’s current deals include two £1.98 bottles of Coca-Cola for £2.50, while Sainsbury’s offers include a 58 per cent saving on a Cadbury Collection tin, bringing the price down to £5.

Britain’s obesity rate has risen from 15 per cent to 26 per cent since 1993, while projections suggest 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women will be obese by 2050.

Just over a third of ten and 
11-year-olds are overweight or obese but in many areas the rates are far
higher, Department of Health figures show.

The worst is Southwark, London, where 42
per cent are deemed too fat. In four other boroughs of the capital – 
Barking, Enfield, Greenwich and Hackney – the figure is 41 per cent.

They are closely followed by Sandwell, 
near Birmingham, where 40 per cent of 11-year-olds are overweight or 
obese, and Manchester, where it is 39 per cent.

Last week the Government signed a voluntary ‘Responsibility Deal’ with supermarkets and food companies to boost the promotion of fruit and vegetables, but Professor Dobson said more radical action was needed.

‘What is required is a comprehensive move away from price promoting unhealthy foods rather than token gestures for marketing spin,’ he added.

‘It is simply irresponsible for supermarkets to overly promote foods  with high sugar and fat content.

Food producers can do more by reducing  the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods, while food retailers can ensure healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable, and that they practise responsible marketing.

‘Responsibility lies with both retailers and producers, otherwise regulation might be needed.’

Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: ‘There’s no such thing as an unhealthy food, only an unhealthy diet.

‘Retailers have been encouraging people to eat more fruit and vegetables with innovative products, prominent promotions and competitive pricing for years.’
