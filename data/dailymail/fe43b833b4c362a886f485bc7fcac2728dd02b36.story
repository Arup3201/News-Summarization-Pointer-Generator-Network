Suspended over the River Thames on wires just over an inch thick, this daring stunt involving the new Jaguar XF looks like something out of a James Bond film. 

The dramatic pictures of the Jaguar rehearsing crossing the Thames  will give car enthusiasts some much-needed excitement in the absence of Top Gear.

With the iconic skyline of Canary Wharf in the backdrop, the Jaguar was pictured yesterday rehearsing for the world's first high-wire water crossing to demonstrate the car's 'lightweight and agile credentials'.

With British stuntman Jim Dowdall, who has appeared in Bond, the Bourne film series and Indiana Jones at the wheel, the sports car was spotted practising traversing across the two 34mm-diameter wires.

Tonight he will perform the feat in full - and it will be broadcast live on Jaguar's website at 7pm.

Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar, said: 'I believe the all-new XF will be the best looking car in its class. 

'Elegant, handsome and with proportions that imbue a great sense of integrity - the all-new XF will be true to the strong tradition of sporting Jaguar saloons while being completely of its time.' 

Jaguar's original XF range was first launched in 2007 and is the biggest selling and most awarded car in its current product range.

Tonight's stunt in the capital's financial district comes a week ahead of its public motor show debut in New York - and enthusiasts can watch it live from  7pm at www.jaguar.co.uk/newxf.

Last week, Jaguar Land Rover laid the foundations for a new £150million automotive technology and innovation centre at Warwick University which is to open in 2017 and employ 1,000 people.

The 33,000 sq m facility will become the hub for Jaguar Land Rover's advanced research with cutting-edge workshops, laboratories, virtual engineering suites and advanced engine facilities. 

It will also 'focus on inspiring the next generation of engineers – from schoolchildren to undergraduates.' 

Jaguar Land Rover already employs more than 8,000 engineers and designers in the UK and in 2015/16 the business will invest up to £3.8billion in product creation. 

The new centre will complement Jaguar Land Rover's existing product research and development centres in Gaydon and Whitley.

Jaguar Land Rover has invested more than £10billion in the last five years and currently employs 34,000 people in total. 

Last year Jaguar land Rover sold 462,678 vehicles – up nine per cent increase on 2013.

Its turnover has almost trebled to £19.4 billion in its financial year ending March 31 2014, with a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion.
