Family slayings: Dean Holmes, 40, pictured, is in jail after confessing to murdering his wife and daughter

An indebted house painter shot dead his wife and 11-year-old daughter, drove to McDonald's for a snack with the girl's body in the car and then handed himself in to police.

Dean Holmes, 40, of Spanaway, Washington, murdered his wife, Kristi, 41, whom he had been lying to about the family's flailing financial affairs, while she slept on Tuesday night.

He woke his daughter, Violet, dropped home her friend who was staying the night then fatally shot the girl in the car.

'The
suspect then drove to a fast food restaurant in Spanaway, purchased a 
meal for himself, then went home and placed his daughter's body in bed 
with his wife's body,' the Pierce County sheriff's office said.

Violet's dead body was in the car while he stopped at McDonald's.

After
several hours spent scrubbing blood from the vehicle and the family home, Holmes walked into 
the county jail in Tacoma and confessed to the shocking double-murder at around 4.45am on Wednesday.

Police say a second child was not at home at the time of the shooting, according to King 5 News.

Holmes, who owns a house painting business, told investigators that he felt he was drowning in debt -- something he'd been hiding from his wife.

The
man owed $18,240 in unpaid 
taxes and had lied to Kristi about a home they were supposed to be moving into. He was also being sued for unfinished work by a client in nearby Puyallup and told officers he and Kristi had been having marriage problems.

All of these things may have pushed Holmes over the edge, police say.

Sherrif's Captain Ed Smith said deputies discovered Kristi and Violet's bodies at the home just before 5am yesterday.

'They did see through the window what appeared to be a person in the bed. The person was non-responsive,' Smith told KOMO News.

'They went ahead and forced entry into the home, and found two deceased persons in the master bedroom bed.'

Connie
Miller, a client of Holmes', told the news organisation she had paid 
the man to paint her shed, then asked for a refund when the job never 
got
done.

'He just kept coming up with excuses,' she said.

'So I called him up and I asked him, 'Dean, if you're not going to paint the shed, can I please get my money back?''

The woman added that if she had known Holmes was so desperate for money, she would not have demanded the refund.

'I would have just gave him the whole $250,' Miller said, crying.

'I had no idea they had these kinds of problems. I never would have even called them. I just would have let the money ride.'

Neighbours were disturbed when they woke on Wednesday to find their street cordoned off with police tape and learned what had happened to the family, who many of them counted as friends.

'I can't understand why anyone would kill their wife let alone their child,' Don Majors told Komo News, struggling to make sense of the tragedy.

Walter Diaz, who lives nearby, told King 5: 'Everybody went to their barbecues, everybody hung out. They walked the neighborhood in the afternoons and the mornings too.'

But one neighbour said Holmes seemed unusually cold on Tuesday.

'He usually says, 'Hi, how's it going?' but nothing,' Kim Sedergren, who shares a backyard fence, told King 5.

'He looked at me with this blank stare and just shut the sliding glass door.'

According to the Orlando Sentinel,
a candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night for the victims, by the
Holmes' neighbours and friends.

Flowers have been placed in the 
driveway of the property.

Holmes is being investigating for two counts of first-degree murder and is expected to make his first court appearance this afternoon. Police say he is cooperating with the investigation.
