Smooth operator: Police claim Alejandra Tobon carried out cosmetic surgery in her garage

Police have arrested a woman who they claim gave Botox, fillers and vitamin injections illegally after turning her garage into a doctor's office.

Alejandra Tobon's house in Pembroke Pines, Florida, was raided yesterday after an informant claiming to be a former patient had an allergic reaction to a Botox jab.

They say the 43-year-old converted her garage 'to have the appearance of a doctor's office' where she also gave plasma and Carboxy therapy without a license.

Although Tobon is registered by the Medical Quality Assurance Services of Florida, the register says she has only gained two licenses in other disciplines, according to checks made by MailOnline.

One certified her as a massage therapist in 2003 and the other as an electrologist in 2009.

Pembroke Pines Police are appealing for more alleged victims to come forward.

A spokesman said: 'Investigation revealed that the listed suspect was performing unlicensed cosmetic procedures inside the garage of her residence.

'The garage was converted to have the appearance of a doctor's office.

'Some of the procedures the suspect was performing included Botox injections, filler injections, vitamin injections, plasma therapy and Carboxy therapy.

'The suspect is not duly licensed in the State of Florida to perform the aforementioned treatments and her actions are a third degree felony.

'If there are any additional victims of Suspect Tobon, they are asked to contact the Pembroke Pines Police Department Investigations Bureau'.

Neighbors told CBS Miami they would often see Tobon wearing scrubs and women going in and out of the house.

'I’m in shock, you know, because sometimes you see the neighbors walking around, saying ‘Hi’ in the morning. But that’s it. So I’m in shock,' said neighbour Dulce Lopez.

Carmen Sanchez added: 'It’s crazy... Going to someone’s house and doing something like that, it has to be crazy.'
