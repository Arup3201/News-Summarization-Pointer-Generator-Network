A former soldier who served in Kosovo has been jailed for life after butchering and dismembering his mother in a brutal and bizarre killing.

Scott Hobson, 32, left his 59-year-old mother Margaret Hobson dead on the floor with 80 separate injuries.

During the sickening attack he carved a cross into her chest before running out into the street in his blood covered clothes where he was spotted by passers by who called police.

Horror: Scott Hobson, 32, left, left his 59-year-old mother Margaret Hobson dead on the floor with 80 separate injuries including carving a cross into her chest before running into the street in blood covered clothes

The psychotic killer was detained indefinitely in a secure mental hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Sheffield Crown Court.

The court heard Hobson, who has a three-year-old daughter, had suffered previous depressive episodes and was a heavy drinker.

Peter Moulson, QC, prosecuting, told the court that Hobson lived with his mother Margaret and father Michael in Walkley, Sheffield. His parents had been married for 36 years.

Two weeks before her death on May 18, Mrs Hobson had finished a course of chemotherapy for cancer and was awaiting a scan to assess the results of the treatment.

Mr Moulson said Hobson’s mental condition worsened in the month before the killing and regulars in a local pub noticed him ‘laughing maniacally to himself for no apparent reason’ two days before the killing.

The next morning he also began ‘swearing shouting and crying uncontrollably’ when he took his daughter Eva to her playgroup.

Mr
Moulson said: 'In the early morning of the day of the 
killing Hobson had been behaving strangely and his father noticed a 
measure of aggression in him. Hobson was talking about people coming 
back to life.'

Mr Hobson, snr, left the house for work to ‘defuse the situation’ at 4.20am and his wife called NHS Direct.

'Obviously
she was concerned about the condition of her son,' Mr Moulson said. 'It
may well have been at the conclusion of that telephone call that Mrs 
Hobson was then subjected to the attack which killed her.'

She was found dead just after 7am by a horrified neighbour, lying across the entrance to the back door. When Hobson was arrested by police at the scene he said: 'You know I didn’t mean it'.

In a report, psychiatrist John Kent said: 'This was a brutal and bizarre killing with features which cannot easily be explained other than they are likely to have formed part of some torture psychotic thinking.'

The court had heard that Hobson, who had served in Kosovo with the Territorial Army, had suffered previous depressive episodes, was a long-standing user of cannabis which could have contributed to his schizophrenia and was a heavy drinker.

Dr Kent said he had ‘relapsing severe mental illness’ which may have links to the misuse of illegal drugs.

Judge Roger Keen, QC, ordered that Hobson, who had no previous convictions, should be treated indefinitely and should only be released with the Home Secretary’s permission.

He said: 'You killed and butchered your mother in the most dreadful and grotesque way. This is a terrible family tragedy. I am satisfied you are suffering from a mental disorder which is capable of medical treatment. There is a clear risk of you committing more offences.'

In a statement, Hobson’s father Michael, said: 'We are still coming to terms with Margaret’s loss. She was a well liked woman and will be missed by all of us very much.'

Peter Wilkinson, from the Sheffield Branch of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association said: 'It is known for troops to turn to drugs to deal with psychological problems.

'It can absolutely happen, it is one way in which it can affect them, because of the situations they have been in or the things they have seen.'
