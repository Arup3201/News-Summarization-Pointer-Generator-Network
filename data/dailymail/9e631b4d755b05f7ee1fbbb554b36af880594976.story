A teenage gymnast who suffered a career-ending spine injury at the age of ten has revealed how she managed to make an unlikely return as one of the sport's top-ranked athletes.

Annie Hilton, 14, from Southern California, who is starring in Gatorade's new Win From Within campaign, was working towards earning a place on the US women's national gymnastics team when a simple mistake during a floor routine left her with a fractured neck. 

But while that injury alone should not have kept her from competing, the pre-teen suffered another devastating blow when doctors diagnosed her with dyslastic spondylolisthesis, a congenital spine disorder which prevented her vertebrae from fusing together.

Star athlete: The gymnast was just ten when she was forced to take more than a year off in order to recover

Annie was forced to undergo painful surgery in order for doctors to put screws in her spine. The procedure left her bedridden for a number of months, with experts predicting that she would then have to spent another year in recovery. 

'Annie had a mishap on floor one day, took off wrong and landed on top of her head,' Southern California Elite Gymnastics Academy coach Kathy Strate explains in the Gatorade video.

'It turned out to be an injury that just needed time to heal, it wasn't in any way a career-ending or serious injury. But as her neck was healing, she noticed that her back was hurting.

'Most kids who take a year or more off do not make a comeback in a sport like this. Gymnastics was over for her.'

'My dream was to compete at World's and to be on the national team for gymnastics,' Annie said. 'When they told me I would have to take a year off, I was devastated.'

Down but not out: Annie initially thought that her injury would take just a matter of months to heal 

'Frustrated': Doctors later diagnosed Annie with a severe spinal disorder which required painful and complex surgery

During the first few months of her recovery, Annie was incredibly frustrated and angry at how helpless she felt. 

'I like trying to feel like I'm independent, but people had to do everything for me; I couldn't even walk on my own,' she recalled.

Her father Dan admits that watching his daughter struggle with just the simplest of tasks was heart-breaking for Annie's family - but to witness her passion slowly start to return as her recovery quickened gave them all the determination and motivation they needed to help her return to her beloved sport. 

'I just remember when she was walking across the room three feet, she was so frustrated, she couldn't stand up,' he said. 

'But by the time she was walking to the end of the hallway, that was almost when the light switch turned on and she could see she was making progress.' 

Determination: Annie has had to dedicate endless hours towards ensuring that she was able to regain her skills

Flying high: The teen defied doctors' expectations when she returned to the gym after just 13 months of recovery

After 13 months of recovery, Annie was finally given the all-clear by doctors and told that she could start to try other forms of physical activity, beyond walking. 

But while many believed that the hardest part of her recovery was over, Annie had to face yet another seemingly impossible battle - returning to gymnastics and attempting to regain all of the skills that she had lost during her time away from the sport. 

'When I would reach down to touch my toes, I would get to about my knees,' Annie said. 'My arms especially - I lost all of my upper body strength.

'It was really hard. I felt so weak.' 

But her determination and unwavering self-belief paid off, and within a year, the teenager was competing - and winning - at national competitions once again.

Comeback kid: Annie's goal is to get a full college scholarship so that she can continue competing at the highest level

'I'm fearless': The young gymnast has managed to overcome every obstacle put in her way

'[Annie] doesn't get down, she just keeps working and working and working,' coach Kathy said. 

'I thought that it was very possible that she could compete the next year. And she was ready to go by the first meet. And she competed not one event, but all four events.

'It's the best comeback story I've seen in 25 years. And the way she's going, she's going to reach her ultimate goal, which is to get a full ride scholarship.' 

'These things just happen and when they do, you have to be ready, you have to put all of your effort into it,' Annie added. 

'What makes me different is that, I'm fearless.'
