Trekking through the Antarctic ice and snow is already a tough job - but Google has persuaded researchers to go the extra mile and do it wearing their special street View backpack.

The search giant has revealed a major update to its Antarctic images, adding a range of hard to reach places.

It persuaded researchers at the Polar Geospatial Center to carry the trekker, a 42 pound backpack with 15 lenses.

Bull Pass in the Murdo Dry Valleys: a relatively ice-free area on a continent where ice covers more than 99 percent of the land.

Google’s Trekker is a modified backpack that carries a 42-pound camera and battery.

The Trekker is operated by a smart phone and consists of 15 lenses angled in a different direction so the images can be stitched together into 360-degree panoramic views.

It is controlled by a smartphone, and images electronically stitched together.

'It’s very exciting because there’s so much more potential for it being useful to scientists,' said Cole Kelleher, a cartographer and support coordinator at PGC, which is headquartered at the University of Minnesota, told the Antarctic Sun.

Kelleher captured most of the imagery using Google’s Trekker, a modified backpack that carries a 42-pound camera and battery.

The Trekker is operated by a smart phone and consists of 15 lenses angled in a different direction so the images can be stitched together into 360-degree panoramic views.

It has previously been used to capture the Grand Canyon, the River Thames and hundreds of other areas around the world where Google's cars and trikes can't reach.

The Internet giant recently unveiled its latest batch of panoramic imagery for its Google Maps and Google Earth applications that include some remote and stunning areas of Antarctica.

PGC cartographer Cole Kelleher walks through the Adélie penguin colony at Cape Royds with the Google Street View camera strapped onto his back.

The mobile Trekker camera was introduced last year and first used in Arizona’s Grand Canyon.

Photos are taken roughly every 2½ seconds while the walker is in motion.

'It’s very top heavy. … That was probably the toughest part – taking care of it and trying not to damage it,' Kelleher told the Sun.

'I told [Google] it would probably not come back in the condition it goes out in.

'You’re out in the middle of nowhere.

'It’s tough terrain - although I only fell about three times.'

Many of the Street View images released are from the McMurdo Dry Valleys a relatively ice-free area on a continent where ice covers more than 99 percent of the land.

The Cape Royal Adelie Penguin Colony: The Adélie Penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, is a species of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast. They are among the most southerly distributed of all seabirds. In 1840, French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville named them for his wife, Adèle.

A short distance from the Geographic South Pole is the Ceremonial South Pole, situated in front of the elevation station building - and it was added in an earlier Google project. It consists of a metallic, mirrored ball atop a 'barber pole' plinth. Surrounding the marker in a semicircle are the flags of the 12 original Antarctic Treaty signatory nations, a tribute to Antarctica's preservation on the environment and dedication to scientific research

Last year, Google released the first batch of Antarctic Street View imagery that had been shot by PGC

It included 3D explorable panoramas of the huts used by two fo the greatest Antarctic explorers - Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott.

The huts have been preserved by the intense cold - and offer an insight into the grim conditions faced by Scott and Shackleton a century ago.

The panoramas were created by a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens - as Google had not yet developed its backpack.

In the winter of 1913, a British newspaper ran an advertisement to promote the latest imperial expedition to Antarctica, apparently placed by polar explorer by Ernest Shackleton

It read, 'Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.'
