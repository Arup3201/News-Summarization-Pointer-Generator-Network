A web designer who claims two A&E departments failed to X-ray his broken leg is still waiting for surgery three weeks later.

Colin Wilson tripped while visiting friends in Hull, East Yorkshire, on February 9 and was taken to A&E at Hull Royal Infirmary two days later in pain.

But a triage nurse did not offer the 31-year-old an X-ray and told him to visit a hospital near his home in Keighley, West Yorkshire - 100 miles away - where once again he was not given the scan.

Unable to drive, he was given a lift home but claimed instead of X-raying him, staff at Airedale Hospital gave him an appointment to see a physiotherapist a week later.

When he attended the appointment, the expert immediately sought a second opinion and he was lined up for surgery, he said.

But after further delays, the surgery has still not happened.

Stuck: Mr Wilson did not attend hospital for two days after his fall, but the pain increased

Mr Wilson, who said he plans to take legal action against the hospitals, said: 'I tripped and at first I thought it was a sprain but the pain gradually got worse so I went to A&E two days later.

'I
 only got as far as the triage nurse who told me it was a bit pointless 
me being there and I should go to my local hospital as an outpatient. 
There was no X-ray.

'So I had to get 100 miles home with a broken leg.

'At
 the Airedale A&E department I did at least get to see a doctor, he 
was even moving my leg back and forth but I was given no X-ray, no pain 
relief and told to see the physiotherapist.

'A
 week later at the physio he walked into the cubicle and took one look 
at my leg and walked out again saying he was getting a second opinion.

'When he looked at it again he said he wasn't happy with the state of the leg and I should go to A&E.

'Eventually they did an X-ray and discovered I had broken my tibia and it had actually shattered.'

The self-employed web designer said he has had to halt plans to start a business while he recovers.

A spokesperson for Hull and East 
Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'To date we have not received any 
contact from Mr Wilson about this issue, so we would encourage him to 
speak with us directly.'

Stacey Hunter, director of operations at Airedale NHS Foundation Trust said: 'It is regrettable that Mr Wilson was not X-rayed when he first attended our A&E department with his leg injury.

A spokesman for the second hospital said the error was 'regrettable' but they are planning to operate

'However, concerns about his injury were picked up as part of his physiotherapy referral and he was X-rayed and immediately referred to an orthopaedic specialist.

'Further tests and discussions with colleagues followed to ensure the most appropriate treatment was carried out.

'Our rescheduling of his operation was a clinical decision to ensure we had a full picture of his injury and that a knee specialist could carry out his surgery. We apologise to Mr Wilson for the breakdown in communication.'
