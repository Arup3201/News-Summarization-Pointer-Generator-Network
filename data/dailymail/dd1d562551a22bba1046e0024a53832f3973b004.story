Though his extramarital exploits became public fodder some three years ago, the details of Tiger Woods’ personality off the green have been heavily guarded.

Former swing coach Hank Haney is changing all of that – revealing Woods’ often selfish, egocentric behaviour in a new book.

He writes during their six years together, Woods showed little respect for those around him, making others pay for takeout and simply leaving a restaurant when he was done eating - whether or not those around him had finished.

For months, Mr Haney was afraid to ask Woods for a Popsicle when the golfer was heading to the refrigerator.

‘He never offered me one or ever came back with one,’ he writes in his book, The Big Miss, which will be released March 27.

He describes the anguish he felt over Woods’ simple lack of courtesy.

‘It actually took me a while to summon the courage to blurt out, “Hey, Bud, do you think I could have one of those Popsicles?”’

In the tell-all, Mr Haney depicts Woods as bad-mannered, cheap, and a lover of pornography and potty-humour.

Before the 2006 Ryder Cup, several golfers, including devout Christian Zach Johnson, shared a hotel room with Woods.

Tiger ‘immediately purchased the adult-move 24-hour package and turned it on,’ Mr Haney said, according to the New York Post.

Mr Johnson had no choice but to ignore the adult programming.

The ex-coach said Tiger let his fame go to his head.

When he would go out to eat with now ex-wife Elin Nordegren, he’d get up and leave, expecting her to follow – even if she hadn’t finished her meal.

‘When he was done – and he habitually ate fast – you were done,’ he wrote.

Though Tiger said he hated the ‘vultures’ in media for picking apart his personal life, he oddly loved his South Park depiction, in which he is seen calling Ms Nordegren a ‘fat Swedish cow.’

The coach quit via text message in May 2010 – perhaps a good move since he said Tiger was glued to his phone and would routinely ignore people to SMS.

As it turned out, the golfer was messaging his mistresses.

Woods has written off the book, calling it ‘unprofessional and very disappointing.’

He told ESPN.com in a telephone interview the book – which will be released prior to the Masters – was especially hurtful because ‘it’s someone I worked with and trusted as a friend.’

He called Mr Haney’s anecdotes ‘one-sided’ and a cheap way to earn money.

‘I’m not going to waste my time reading it,' Woods said.

In the end, the 247-page book ends with Mr Haney wishing Tiger well – he even thanks him for ‘an incredibly rewarding six years.’
