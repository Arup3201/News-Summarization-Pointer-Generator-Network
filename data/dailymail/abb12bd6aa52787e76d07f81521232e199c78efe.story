Indicted: Nicole DuFault, 35, is charged with 40 counts of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child for allegedly having trysts with 14- and 15-year-old boys 

A female New Jersey high school teacher accused of having sex with six male students is now facing a 40-count indictment in New Jersey.

Essex County authorities say 35-year-old Nicole DuFault, of Caldwell, is charged with aggravated sexual assault and child endangerment.

Authorities say the victims were 14- and 15-year-old boys and the assaults occurred repeatedly in 2013 and 2014. They say some of the sex acts took place on school property and in DuFault's car.

The indictment was made public Tuesday.

DuFault, a divorced mother of two, was a language arts teacher at Columbia High School for several years before she was arrested in September. She remains free on $500,000 bail.

Her attorney has said the charges 'run contrary to her commendable background and unblemished work performance.' 

The teacher is due back in court March 6.  

In investigating the allegations against DuFault, 34, authorities said they had discovered a video in her home that depicted the educator performing oral sex on one of the victims - along with a piece of clothing she was wearing at the time.

DuFault is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual
 assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported.

At least one other victim is supposedly present in the video.

DuFault has been a language arts teacher for nine years at Columbia High School (pictured) in Maplewood, New Jersey. Prosecutors say some of the assaults happened in her car and on school property and that they now have eyewitnesses to testify

Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim argued in September that DuFault had seen two prior complaints lodged against her at Columbia High School for 'lack of professionalism and her conduct.'

She was accused of having 'inappropriate sexual conversations in the classroom,' in one complaint.

Broken home: DuFault's two sons, ages 2 and 4, have been removed from her custody, and her husband left her last year

She was also accused of lying about her work experience on her resume, listing one former employer where she never actually worked. 

Prosecutors
 in Essex County said after her arrest that DuFault, who taught language arts at Columbia 
High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular 
academic year and summer school between 2013-2014.

The
 encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's 
campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, 
authorities charge.

She faces 12 separate charges. Each alleged victim was 14 or 15 at the time of the encounters.

DuFault's two sons, ages 2 and 4, have been removed from her custody. Her husband left her last year, reported CBS New York. 

Beyond the videotape, the state evidence reportedly includes statements from at least five of the victims about their encounters with DuFault and witnesses that also 'witnessed her in sexual acts with others.' 

Ms DuFault was arrested at her home September 17, 2014. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations.

'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York. .
