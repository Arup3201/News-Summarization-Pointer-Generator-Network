Command: Admiral Bill McRaven, commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, addresses the National Defense Industrial Association in Washington

The commander of the Navy SEALs raids 
which killed Osama bin Laden and rescued hostage Jessica Buchanan has 
been berated by a retired Lt General for publicising such operations - 
and putting future deployments at risk.

Admiral Bill McRaven, who led the bin Laden raid and heads the U.S. Special Operations Command, was told by retired Army Lieutenant General James Vaught to 'get the hell out of the media' to safeguard the secrets and security of special operations.

According to ABC News, Vaught told McRaven: 'Since the time when your wonderful team went and drug bin Laden out and got rid of him, and more recently when you went down and rescued the group in Somalia, or wherever the hell they were, they’ve been splashing all of this all over the media.

'I flat don’t understand that.'

And he added: 'Back when my special operators extracted Saddam [Hussein] from the hole, we didn’t say one damn word about it. 

'We
 turned him over to the local commander and told him to claim that his 
forces dug him out of the hole, and he did so. And we just faded away 
and kept our mouth shut.

'Now
 I’m going to tell you: one of these days, if you keep publishing how 
you do this, the other guy’s going to be there ready for you, and you’re
 going to fly in and he’s going to shoot down every damn helicopter and 
kill every one of your SEALs.

'Now, watch it happen. Mark my words. Get the hell out of the media.'

Response: Admiral McRaven said Vaught's was a 'great point', but that avoiding media coverage was almost impossible in the 24-hour news cycle

But McRaven told his audience at the 
National Defense Industrial Association in Washington, D.C. that 
avoiding media coverage was almost impossible in the 24-hour news cycle,
 and that while he objected to revealing sensitive tactics, the media 
could be useful, even when reporting operations which had gone wrong.

He joked that he became a Navy SEAL 
because his sister was dating a special forces member and because he was
 infatuated with John Wayne’s movie, 'The Green Beret'.

'The
 fact of the matter is, there have always been portrayals of SOF 
[Special Operations Forces] out in the mainstream media,' he added.

'We
 are in an environment today where we can’t get away from it. It is not 
something that we actively pursue, as I think a number of the 
journalists here in the audience will confirm.

'But
 the fact of the matter is, with the social media being what it is 
today, with the press and the 24-hour news cycle, it’s very difficult to
 get away from it.

'But not only does the media focus on our successes, we
 have had a few failures. And I think having those failures exposed in 
the media also kind of helps focus our attention, helps us do a better 
job.

'So sometimes the
 criticism, the critique, the spotlight on us actually makes us better,'
 McRaven said, before adding that Vaught had made a 'great point' and they didn't want to get to the point where 'sensitive tactics, techniques and procedures are open for everybody to take a look at so that next time we come in on a target we are exposed'.

The
 raids on bin Laden and the compound where two western hostages were held in Somalia attracted 
worldwide publicity.

A film about SEALs - Act of Valor - is due out 
shortly, while Oscar-winning film director Kathryn Bigelow is set to 
release a movie about the operation which ended with the killing of the 
Al Qaeda leader later this year.

The admiral added he was working to give his 66,000-person force — expected to grow to 70,000 over the next few years — more predictable schedules to reduce strain on families.

He also spoke of working to break down the stigma of combat stress.

'If you have been engaged in this war for any length of time, you are fundamentally changed,' he said. But special operations troops typically don't seek help for emotional problems.

'I encourage them to come in. We're not going to pull their security clearances,' McRaven said. 'We're going to take care of them.'
