The internet went into overdrive when Justin Bieber and Lara Stone were revealed as the new Calvin Klein campaign stars.

A few tweeters were, however, convinced that the pop star had a little help to make his muscles look more defined, with one tweeting: 'They airbrushed Justin Bieber to the high heavens!'

Despite his naysayers, the Believe singer has revealed that he worked extremely hard to whip his body into shape for his latest gig.

Airbrushed? Twitter came alive with chatter of Photoshopping after the launch of Justin Bieber's Calvin Klein campaign but the singer claims he worked out five teams a week with a personal trainer ahead of the shoot

The 20-year-old singer claims that he exercised intensely with his trainer.

He said: 'I work out with my trainer, Patrick Nilsson, five days a week for about 45 minutes each. 

'We do three-days splits: back and triceps one day, chest and biceps on day two, shoulder and legs on day three, and abs every other day.

'I'm not on a special diet, but I do try to watch what I eat. I do eat unhealthy sometimes - I am a 20-year-old guy!'

Tweeters pointed out that Justin's abs seem slightly more defined in the campaign shots compared to a softer appearance in the video co-starring Lara Stone.

Another user tweeted: 'They airbrushed a lot of muscle onto little Justin Bieber.'

MailOnline has contacted Calvin Klein for comment.

How did he do it? Justin says he works out five days a week for about 45 minutes each to achieve his toned look for the Calvin Klein campaign

Justin is known for working out a lot and has gradually built up his muscle with bodybuilding over the years.

The singer is so committed to working out that he has even been seen in the gym while recovering from a broken foot.

In a video posted online, Justin can be seen walking into a weights room with crutches before putting them aside to do some pull ups. 

Lara Stone, meanwhile, has publicly documented her road to her post-pregnancy body. 

Comments: Twitter came alive with speculation over the young popstar's muscles

The 31-year-old recently revealed that her pregnancy - and the months afterwards - were less about 'earth mother' perfection and more about bloating, limp hair and self-criticism.

She admits that she developed a love of fried food and that it took her a while to slip back into her pre-pregnancy jeans.

But the supermodel, who gave birth to her first child - Alfred - with David Walliams in May 2013, worked hard to shift her post-baby pounds and shows off the fruits of her labour in the new shoot.

Lara works out with Clean & Lean guru, James Duigan, who developed a 'super gentle' routine for her to follow.

Co-star: Model Lara Stone has been working out with James Duigan to get back in shape after having a baby

The programme, which they shared on Net-a-Porter, involves five key moves, designed to provide all-over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as new mums.

The first exercise involves keeping your feet on the floor with your toes up - which engages your glutes - before slowly raising your hips and squeezing your buttocks. This simple move is repeated about 10 times.

'They are so easy to do anywhere like in a hotel,' Lara says.

James claims the next move, The Superman, is the 'supermodel secret to a flat tummy'.

It involves kneeling on a mat on all fours before extending and retracting the opposite leg and arm simultaneously.

Other key moves involve the basic squat while inhaling on the way down and exhaling on the way up, and leg lifts using a resistance band round the knees to add resistance.

The final move the power pair love is the 'non-surgical boob lift', which involves going into a half-squatting position and holding that while fully extending the arms outwards and upwards.

'This really engages all the muscles that are going to lift up your chest,' James explains.

Foodwise, James gives Lara healthy meal plans with dishes such as sesame-crusted chicken with avocado and spinach salad and clean and lean oat pancakes.

The key to James’ philosophy is to eat clean foods (as close to their natural state as possible), cut back on CRAP (caffeine, refined sugar, alcohol and processed foods), eat lots of good fats (nuts, avocados, oily fish) and limit bad fats (bacon fat, pies, processed meats etc).

James says: ‘If it didn’t once fly, swim or walk, or wasn’t pulled from the ground, from a bush or a plant, don’t eat it! And you don’t have to get this right 100 per cent of the time. If you aim for 80 per cent, you’ll be okay.’

The new Calvin Klein images were shot by fashion photographers Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott in New York City.

The campaign continues the brand's association with music and pop culture, which began with the famous shots of Marky Mark (Wahlberg) and Kate Moss back in the Nineties.

'Given my on-going relationship with the house, this shoot reunited me with my Calvin Klein family -and it was really fun working with Justin,' said Stone.

'We had a great time on set and we had a lot of fun shooting the campaign. I think the shoot really captured the energy of the Calvin Klein brand.'
