Apple will finally let customers know what is draining the battery life of their devices with the introduction of iOS 8, their latest mobile operating system.

This new system gives users a display screen that allows them to see what apps they have been using, and just how much power those apps are taking up on their device.

Even better, the mobile software is available across all devices, not just the recently introduced iPhone 6.

Users who have the iOS 8 will be able to see a display of all their apps on a new battery usage screen that ranks, from highest to lowest, the percentage of phone power each app has used.

This then allows users to adjust their phone's settings for optimum battery life. 

Apple is currently riding a high following the release of the new iPhone 6, which sold a record-breaking four million units in just the first 24 hours of pre-order sales.

That number doubles the company's previous pre-order record of two million devices for the iPhone 5 back in 2012. 

Long lines: A record number of people lined up around the world this Friday to get their hands on the new iPhone 6

And while first day sales of the device, which became available to the public this past Friday, have not been reported yet, the long lines the release drew in major cities including London, New York, and San Francisco, to name just a few, has many investors optimistic that the company will have another record-breaking day of sales to celebrate when the numbers become finalized later this week.
