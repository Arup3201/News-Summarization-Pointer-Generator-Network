Buyers of these apartments might need to offer prior warning to guests before inviting them to a pool party - especially if they are troubled by vertigo.

The building, planned for Lima, Peru is  the concept of DCPP Arquitectos and offers owners the chance of a home with their very own swimming pool.

The pools have been designed to jut out from the building, giving the impression to swimmers that they are practising front crawl suspended in mid-air.

Pool the resources: DCPP Arquitectos designed the Sky Condos project for an affluent neighborhood in Lima, Peru

Water world: The new project offers homeowners the chance to a private pool... some suspended 20 floors above the ground

The structure, called Sky Condos, is 
scheduled to be built an affluent neighborhood with golf course views in
 the capital of nine million residents.

The Mexican architecture firm explained their concept, stating: 'We sought to create an icon for the future, a new luxury housing concept in Latin America; combining the idea of incorporating the exterior space to the interior life of the apartments and creating a new relation between public and private areas.'

The 20-floor tower of apartments has an open-plan feel to allow as much natural light as possible and give the impression that each home is suspended on its own.

DCPP has created other dramatically ambitious projects including an open-plan cafe and garden structure in Mexico City which transforms into a nightclub after dark. The firm has plans to revitalize the harbor in Helsinki, Finland.Â
