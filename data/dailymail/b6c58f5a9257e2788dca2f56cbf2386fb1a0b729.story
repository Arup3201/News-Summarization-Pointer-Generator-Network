Drug lord: Benjamin Arellano Felix was at the helm of a cartel that smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S.

A Mexican drug lord who pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money can be sentenced to no more than 25 years in jail.

An agreement between Benjamin Arellano Felix, 58, - the leader of a cartel that once smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana into the United States and dissolved bodies of its rivals in vats of soda in the 1990s - and federal prosecutors was reached in San Diego yesterday.

It is a lighter punishment than ordered for lower-ranking members of his once-mighty, Tijuana-based cartel.

He also agreed to forfeit $100 million in profits.

Prosecutors decided to dismiss other charges that could have brought 140 years in prison if he was convicted.

Arellano Felix told a judge that he has been suffering migraines almost daily but that his headaches didn't impair his judgment to accept the prosecutors' offer.

Yesterday's half-hour hearing was an 
anticlimactic finish to the U.S. government's pursuit of the head of an 
organisation that smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine and marijuana to 
the U.S.

One of the most high-profile drug lords to face prosecution, Arellano Felix will be sentenced in April.

Smugglers: Arellano Felix's cartel has an iron-tight grip on the drug trade from Mexico to the U.S. Picture: Mexico's border with the U.S.

Arellano Felix's cartel, with its iron-tight grip on the drug trade along California's border with Mexico, was portrayed in the Steven Soderbergh film Traffic but has struggled in recent years as other cartels have become more ruthless than ever.

The U.S. indictment said Arellano Felix was the top leader of a cartel he led with his brothers, going back to 1986.

It says the cartel tortured and 
killed rivals in the U.S. and Mexico as it smuggled Mexican 
marijuana and Colombian cocaine.

Robert Bonner, former head of the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a former federal judge, said 
the sentence 'may not be perfect justice but it certainly is adequate 
justice.'

He said there are many reasons why lower-ranking cartel members may get longer sentences, including strength of the evidence or the government's reluctance to disclose informants in a trial.

'You never have perfect equity in sentencing, and there's no reason to expect it,' said Mr Bonner, who was not involved in the case.

Lawyers who have followed the case said the lighter sentence may be because the alleged crimes occurred many years ago and relied on witness accounts, instead of wiretaps or physical evidence.

John Kirby, a former federal prosecutor who co-wrote the 2003 indictment against Arellano Felix, said cases can weaken over time as witnesses die or change their minds about testifying.

'This kind of case is based solely on witness testimony, and it slowly disintegrates,' he said.

'Maybe from the time when we put it together and now, it's not such a great case anymore.'

Laura Duffy, the U.S. lawyer in San Diego who built much of her career on the case, said Arellano Felix is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.

'Today's (Wednesday's) guilty plea marks the end of his reign of murder, mayhem and corruption, and his historic admission of guilt sends a clear message to the Mexican cartel leaders operating today.

'The United States will spare no effort to investigate, extradite and prosecute you for your criminal activities,' Ms Duffy said.

Anthony Colombo Jr., Arellano Felix's lawyer, said his client could be released from U.S. prison in 20 years if credited for time served in this country and good behavior, assuming he gets the maximum 25-year sentence.

As a Mexican citizen, he would then be deported to Mexico, where he still has nine years left on a sentence for related crimes.

Mr Colombo said the government may have agreed to the deal to avoid having to bargain with 21 potential government witnesses for reduced sentences in exchange for their testimony.

Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, the defendant's younger brother who led the cartel after Arellano Felix was arrested in Mexico in 2002, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007, a year after he was captured by U.S. authorities in international waters off Mexico's Baja California coast.

Jesus Labra Aviles, a lieutenant under Benjamin Arellano Felix, was sentenced in San Diego to 40 years in prison in 2010.
