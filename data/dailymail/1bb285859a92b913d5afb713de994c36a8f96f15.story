Tottenham are pressing ahead with plans to appoint Mauricio Pochettino as their next manager.

And the White Hart Lane club are growing increasingly confident they can announce Pochettino as Tim Sherwood's replacement by the end of week.

Spurs have privately expressed to Southampton their interest in the Argentine and work towards appointing the manager has been ongoing behind the scenes for a fortnight.

Is that the way to White Hart Lane? Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino looks set for Tottenham

Turmoil: Spurs have endured a difficult season which culminated in the sacking of Tim Sherwood 

Talks are at an advanced stage, and barring a last-minute collapse in the deal, Pochettino should be installed as new White Hart Lane chief in the coming days.

Sportsmail revealed Tottenham's intention to approach Pochettino on March 7.

However, the 42-year-old has been forced to fend off competition from Ajax boss Frank de Boer, who made a late rally for the post last week.

Pochettino has forged a reputation as one of the country's most-promising managers since his arrival in 2013.

And he is now set to be handed the task of firing Tottenham back into the Champions League.

De Boer's hopes had been been raised again despite his controversial outburst following his fourth successive Eredivisie triumph with Ajax.

The Dutchman was openly critical of Tottenham's handling of their recruitment process when he discovered he was among a number of candidates.

De Boer has the pedigree after a phenomenal start to his managerial career in Holland and has also worked with Spurs' star midfielder Christian Eriksen.

Headscratcher: Daniel Levy (front centre) has a decision to make about the next Tottenham manager

But Pochettino's representatives have persuaded Levy that the Southampton manager could  make the step up to one of English football's top clubs.

He has been involved in a series of talks with Saints aimed at keeping him at St Mary's, but he has yet to make a decision. 

Levy, coming under increasing pressure to make an appointment, is ready to make his final move within the next two days.

Tottenham had also spoken to former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini about the job but the Italian is not now a contender.

Mancini is currently in Turkey with Galatasaray and has just finished his first season in Istanbul by winning the domestic cup.

The 49-year-old is looking for a return to the Barclays Premier League and was very keen on the job at White Hart Lane. Mancini feels he has unfinished business in England after being sacked by City just over a year ago.
