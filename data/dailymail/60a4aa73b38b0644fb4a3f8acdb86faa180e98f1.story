Vicente del Bosque and his Spain team have endured a torrid time during the 2014 World Cup, but that doesn't mean the veteran manager can jump ship just yet.

Del Bosque was spotted attempting to get onto Chile's team coach before being pointed in the right direction shortly after Spain's 2-0 defeat at the Maracana.    

The 2-0 defeat sent the World Cup holders crashing out of the summer tournament after just two games.

La Roja suffered a shock 5-1 defeat at the hands of Holland last week as goals from Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Stefan de Vrij secured three points for the Dutch in Group B.

Del Bosque made several changes to the side for Wednesday's match against Chile but his side were unable to overcome a spirited Chile team.

Speaking after the game, Del Bosque said: 'It's true that when such things happen during a World Cup or a tournament like this then it has consequences but I don't want to start thinking about that right now.

'We have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now.

'There will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do.

'I think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for Spanish football and that applies to myself as well.'
