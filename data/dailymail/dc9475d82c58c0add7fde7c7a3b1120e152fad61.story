Up to a million people are expected to line the route of the men’s cycle road race today, hoping to roar Mark Cavendish to Team GB’s first gold medal.

Just six days after Bradley Wiggins’s astonishing victory in the Tour de France, Cavendish is hot favourite to win the 156-mile Olympic race.

It goes from central London to Surrey, where riders will do nine laps of hilly terrain, and back to the capital again.

The crowd will rival the hordes that turn out to watch the London Marathon and the race could be the best-attended outdoor sports event in Britain of all time.

World champion Cavendish, known as the Manx Missile, is expected to be cheered on by his girlfriend, former Page 3 model Peta Todd, 25 – mother of his four-month-old daughter – and a TV audience of millions.

Last weekend in France Cavendish, 27, was one of the Team Sky cyclists who helped Wiggins emerge victorious.

Today roles will be reversed as Wiggins and other Team GB cyclists try to ensure Cavendish takes gold.

Should he triumph near Buckingham Palace at around 3.40pm, it will be the perfect start for Team GB’s hopes for a record haul of medals.

There is also a growing expectation that Britain’s Lizzie Armitstead, 23, will gain a medal in tomorrow’s 87-mile women’s cycling race, which has the same route but involves two – as opposed to nine – circuits of Box Hill.

Olympic organisers believe a Cavendish victory will fuel the feelgood factor in the country and inspire other British competitors.

The men’s and women’s road races are two of the most eagerly awaited events of the Games.

Viewing is largely free and the races come at a time of unprecedented interest in top-level cycling.

Today’s race, which starts at 10am, takes riders from the heart of London, through Richmond Park and into the Surrey countryside where they will make nine ascents of Box Hill, and back to the Mall.

Thousands of police and security officers will be on duty amid fears that a publicity-seeking protest group might try to pull off a stunt that could damage Cavendish’s chances.

Travel chaos is expected with dozens of key roads in London and Surrey closed to facilitate the race. But few will care about the disruption if Cavendish, who is renowned for his blistering speed on the home straight, is victorious.

He says he feels no additional pressure despite potentially being the first home champion of London 2012.

He said: ‘An Olympic medal, regardless if it’s the first or last on offer, it’s an Olympic medal for your team.

‘It’s easy to get emotional about it. I’ve been nervous this week. We’ve trained to be able to deal with those nerves and we’ve got to put it to bed.’

Cavendish is joined in the five-man 
squad by Wiggins, Chris Froome, who was second in the Tour de France, 
David Millar and Ian Stannard. Manx-born Cavendish described it as ‘the 
dream team’.

Team GB officials will hope there is 
no repeat of the Twitter spat between some of the WAGs during the Tour 
de France after Froome was ordered to slow down to allow Wiggins to 
catch up during the 11th stage.

In a thinly-veiled jibe Froome’s 
girlfriend, South African sports photographer Michelle Cound, tweeted: 
‘Teamwork is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a
chance to shine in their own right.’

In response, Wiggins’s wife Catherine 
praised other  members of Team Sky for ‘genuine, selfless effort and 
true professionalism’ – but omitted Froome.

Meanwhile Cavendish’s partner Miss Todd wrote of Froome: ‘You are a little bit special. Legend.’ No mention was made of Wiggins.
