Mexican surrealist painter Frida Kahlo has always been something of an enigma.

Famed for her colourful but disturbing self-portraits, that unabashed mono-brow, a turbulent marital relationship with fellow artist Diego Rivera and a raft of severe health problems, Kahlo, who was born in 1907, has fascinated art lovers for decades.

But now the mist is clearing over a little more of her life, thanks to a new exhibition of her clothes, orthopaedic paraphernalia and even prosthetic limbs being displayed inside one of the Mexico City homes she shared with her husband.

Smoke and Mirrors: Frida Kahlo's 
Dresses displays 300 accessories, corsets, clothes and health contraptions worn 
by Kahlo that have been locked away for over 50 years since her death in
 1954, aged 47.

The exhibition also features a number of items designed by famous names - such as Jean Paul Gaultier and Givenchy -Â  inspired by the artist.

The artist wore corsets, left, to minimise constant pain due to childhood polio and a near fatal bus crash, and wore long dresses, right, partly in homage to indigenous Mexican women, and partly to hide her deformed body

The fascinating artifacts including 
jewellery, a corset emblazoned with the Communist logo, shawls, 
photographs, and a number of her trademark brightly coloured dresses, shirts
 and skirts.

Most intimate of all is the booted prosthetic leg she wore after having her 
right leg amputated at the knee due to gangrene.

The exhibits are on display in the Frida Kahlo Museum, formerly known
 as the Blue House, the home in which where she lived with muralist 
Rivera. Museum officials discovered the items in 2004 when they entered 
previously sealed rooms of the Blue House.

The exhibit 
explores Kahlo's unique wardrobe which was chiefly inspired by Mexico's 
indigenous women who were famous for their richly embroidered frocks, flowery 
headpieces and ornate silver jewellery.

But beneath her long dresses, Kahlo 
hid a body that had been contorted by childhood polio and then only just
 survived a horrific bus crash. Kahlo contracted polio when she was young, and the disease stunted the growth of her right leg.

When 
she was 18, a metal tube pierced through her abdomen during a bus crash,
 subjecting her to painful operations and long periods of bed rest 
throughout her life. She had her right leg amputated in 1953, a year before her death.

The
 exhibit also includes three artistic corsets, one made of leather and 
designed by Gaultier for Comme des Garcons in memory of the painter, who
 died in 1954 at the age of 47. She wore corsets because of severe back 
pain.

Kahlo's unique style made her a 
fashion muse and earned her a spot in Vogue magazine in 1937. Mexican 
Vogue is sponsoring the new exhibition.
