Between the spy drone that was said to have flown over the French training camp last week and the goal-line cameras  used here on Sunday night, Honduras would probably argue that technology has done their World Cup bid no favours.

They should perhaps blame themselves, too, for an over-physical approach that ultimately proved their undoing, Wilson Palacios becoming embroiled in a 45-minute wrestling match with Paul Pogba and getting himself sent off. His second yellow card, earned for a stupid challenge on the towering Juventus midfielder inside the area, was the decisive moment of the match.

There have been some controversial penalties in this tournament already but this was not one of them, Karim Benzema stepping up to secure the first-half advantage France deserved. But the circumstances surrounding what appeared to be Benzema’s second — it was given as an own goal three minutes after the break — could be a source of argument long after this encounter concluded.

Was it in? Karim Benzema starts to celebrate, believing he has made it 2-0 to France against Honduras

Controversial: At first, goal-line technology showed it wasn't at goal, but it was looking at the wrong angle

Proof: But on second glance, the proof was there that the ball HAD crossed the line

Desperate: Noel Valladares tries to stop the ball going in, but it went down as an own goal from the goalkeeper

Complaining: The Honduras players weer sure that the goal shouldn't have been allowed

France (4-1-2-2-1): Lloris 6; Debuchy 6, Varane 7, Sakho 6, Evra 6;  Cabaye 7 (Mavuba 65 6); Pogba 6 (Sissoko 57 6), Matuidi 7; Valbuena 8.5, Griezmann 8; Benzema 7.

Booked: Evra, Pogba, Cabaye.

Honduras (4-4-2): Valladares 4; Beckeles 6, Bernardez 5 (O Chavez 46 6), Figueroa 6, Izaguirre 6; Najar 5 (Claros 58 6), Garrido 6, Palacios 4, Espinoza 6; Bengston 5 (O Garcia 46 6) 6, Costly 5.

Booked: Palacios, O Garcia.

Sent off: Palacios (second yellow).  

Referee: S Ricci (Brazil) 6.

Man of the match: Valbuena. 

It was some half-volley that Benzema 
produced from a marvellous diagonal pass by Yohan Cabaye. But only after
 the ball bounced off a post, across the face of goal and struck Noel 
Valladares, the  Honduras goalkeeper, did it seemingly cross the 
goal-line.

The problem was what appeared on the big screen. The 
declaration that it was ‘No Goal’ sparked wild celebrations among the 10
 men of Honduras but was clearly a judgment made on the position of the 
ball before it reached Valladares.

A second judgment soon followed. 
‘Goal,’ the screen declared, Brazilian referee Sandro Ricci confirming 
the strike he had actually awarded the moment it was scored. Presumably 
he had received a buzz from his watch. It was a World Cup first.

The 
trouble was, pictures remained inconclusive to the naked eye and the 
more they were shown on the screen, the more confused everyone became. 
Didier Deschamps was baffled and expressed his sympathy to Luis Suarez, 
the coach of Honduras.

At least there was no disputing who scored France’s third goal; a blistering effort from Benzema in the 72nd minute.

Thump: Benzema made it 3-0, but not a hat-trick, with a fine effort into the roof of the net

Pride: The big forward was in fine form on Sunday night in Brazil

Patience: Karim Benzema put Les Bleus in front, converting a penalty just before half time

No chance: The goalkeeper is sent the wrong way by the Real Madrid striker

Sloppy: Wilson Palacios was sent off for a second bookable offence after needlessly bringing down Paul Pogba

A
 match lacking national anthems — presumably because of some kind of 
technical hitch — did not lack atmosphere, the Estadio Beira-Rio buzzing
 with excitement thanks to the French fans. 

What everyone 
anticipated, of course, was a physical contest from Honduras but France 
 collected the first booking after Patrice Evra’s naughty challenge on 
Andy Najar. 

France looked strong, Pogba giving them an imposing 
presence in midfield. Patrick Vieira sees much of himself in the former 
Manchester United midfielder, modestly suggesting the 21-year-old has 
been blessed with superior skill.

Pogba certainly made his presence 
felt in an aerial challenge with Palacios, the Honduras midfielder 
coming off distinctly second best. 

When a free-kick from Mathieu 
Valbuena was diverted into the path of Blaise Matuidi, his half-volley 
was pushed against the bar by Valladares.

The crossbar would then deny Antoine Griezmann after the Real Sociedad forward met a cross from Evra with a decent header.  

On-field battle: The duo clashed earlier in the game, resulting in two yellow cards

Petulent: After being stamped on, Pogba lashed out at Palacios, kicking him into the air

The
 only concern, at least for Deschamps, was an apparent desire to meet 
fire with fire. Pogba and Palacios were having a real battle, the Stoke 
midfielder appearing to stamp on Pogba with the Frenchman then lashing 
out — David Beckham-style — in response.

Both were booked when at 
least one red card could have been issued for a clash that sparked 
something of a melee between the two sides.

French opportunities kept coming, with Griezmann — who really excites their fans — consistently threatening. 

The
 breakthrough came when Palacios crashed into the back of Pogba and gave
 the Brazilian referee no option but to award the spot-kick and banish 
the Honduran. Benzema converted stylishly.

If Deschamps is pleased 
with the result, he will be less impressed that his team picked up three
 bookings, given he is a stickler for discipline. He is also sure to 
note that Pogba was a little fortunate not to get sent off. Even so, he 
will be encouraged by the display against some intimidation.

And Greg
 Dyke will be relieved too. After securing three points, the FA chairman
 will be delighted that the ‘mass suicides’ across the English Channel 
that he predicted are now unlikely to occur.
