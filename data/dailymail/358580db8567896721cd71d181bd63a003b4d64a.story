A foul-mouthed psychiatrist who swore at staff and said a patient ‘can just go and kill herself’ faces being struck off after being found guilty of misconduct.

Dr Marinus Klijnsma told a tribunal that his use of inappropriate and offensive language was a ‘dysfunctional habit’ that got worse over the years.

Some of his secretaries received angry voicemail messages in which he asked: ‘Where the f**k are you?’

'Played by his own rules': Psychiatrist Dr Marinus Klijnsma faces being struck off after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (pictured) heard he swore at and abused staff and patients and took unauthorised leave

In another voicemail he said: ‘Whenever I f**king ring you, you’re not at your f**king desk. You never answer the f**king phone.’

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard that the doctor made the ‘go kill herself’ remark when he was told that one of his psychiatric patients was going to appear on a television programme.

He ‘played by his own rules,’ taking unauthorised time off work
and unapproved holidays, while using NHS facilities for his own private
practice, it heard.

Dutch-born Klijnsma admitted to all charges at the tribunal in Manchester in relation to his employment at the Linden Centre and the Gables, in Braintree, Essex, between 1999 and 2011.

The doctor, who has also been in private practice at the Priory Hospital, in Chelmsford, Essex, since 2000, was found guilty of misconduct and now faces a ban from the profession.

Panel chairman, Dr Bernard Herdan told the doctor: ‘The panel has determined that there is a low risk of repetition, and that you do not pose a direct risk to patients.

Misconduct: The panel deemed his fitness to practice 'currently impaired' after he committed the charges while working at the Gables (pictured) and the Linden Centre, both in Braintree, Essex

‘Indeed, the panel accepts the wealth of evidence that you are a good doctor, and that you are seen by your colleagues as one who provides excellent care and has a strong commitment to the interests of your patients.

‘However, the panel has concluded that in all the circumstances of this case including, in particular, your defiance of the requirements set out for you by the trust and your dishonesty, you seriously compromised the reputation of the profession and your conduct was such as would undermine the public’s trust in doctors.'

He continued: 'The panel has determined that the need to uphold proper professional standards and public confidence in the profession would be undermined if a finding of impairment were not made in the particular circumstances of this case. 

‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that your fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of your misconduct.’

Klijnsma abused the trust placed in him by the NHS, using public-funded facilities and resources for the provision of private practice without the North Essex trust’s agreement, the tribunal heard.

Faces ban: The tribunal heard that Klijnsma used NHS facilities for his own private practice. Panel chairman Dr Bernard Herdan said that while 'he did not pose a direct risk to patients' he 'compromised the reputation of the profession'

He ‘dishonestly’ took fees from patients while working within the NHS and even asked his secretary to help him with his private work, the panel heard.

On one occasion he treated a Dutch patient, who had got the ferry from Holland to see him, at the Linden Centre.

Klijnsma told the hearing: ‘I offered. I was aware at the time I was offering a private patient in an NHS facility in NHS time. That was wrong.’

‘I was very aware that what I did was not acceptable.’ 

Klijnsma described using inappropriate and offensive language towards staff as a ‘dysfunctional habit’ that got worse over the years.

The panel heard that a receptionist at The Gables heard a patient comment that she had been waiting to see Klijnsma for 45 minutes.

She heard him reply: ‘I suppose you think I have been sitting on my arse all morning.’

On being informed a junior doctor had called in sick he said: ‘He’s a f**king w***er, he can go and play with his willy.’ 

But giving evidence, he told the panel: ‘It has been a long-standing habit. The kind of swearing that came about under stress or to let off steam. That swearing has got worse in the years leading up to this.’

To let off steam: Klijnsma told the tribunal that swearing was a 'long-standing habit' and came about because of stress (file photo)

'The use of the F-word came out of feeling frustrated I think. It was not meant to insult her [his secretary].

Klijnsma has also admitted to taking unauthorised absences from his work at the Linden Centre between June 2009 and May 2011.

On some of these occasions he undertook private practice work despite being contracted to work for the NHS clinic.

Simon Jackson QC, for the General Medical Council suggested this formed part of a pattern of the doctor ‘setting his own rules’.

He added: ‘On those dates you were absent from duties without authorisation it must follow that you abused the trust placed in you and you would do other things that you weren’t supposed to be doing.’

The tribunal heard that Klijnsma would ‘fly under the radar’ by ignoring annual leave protocol, in one year taking 11 more days holiday than he was entitled to.

Mr Jackson said: ‘You were running a system where you were playing by your own rules under the radar.’

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
