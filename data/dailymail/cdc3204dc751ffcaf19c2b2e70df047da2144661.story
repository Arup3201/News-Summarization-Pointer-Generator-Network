All Joseph Valente wanted for his 96th birthday was a slice of his favorite German apple ring cake from King Kullen supermarket.

But what he got was a severe case of diarrhea after allegedly biting into a dead rat.

The New York man's nephew, Neil Gold, said his uncle complained about the taste after downing one spoonful on Thursday night.

Rude shock: Joseph Valente specifically requested a German apple ring cake from King Kullen supermarket for his 96th birthday and was disgusted to find a rodent inside

Interesting ingredient: Valenti's disgusted family say they found a five-inch-long rat's tail still attached to the rodentÂ¿s hindquarters inside the sweet cake

Foul: Valenti's nephew Neil Gold said his uncle took a bite of the rodent-infested cake and complained about the taste

Unique topping: The rodent tail and what appeared to be grayish mold were embedded in the yellow cake

When Gold cut the store-baked cake, he said he noticed what looked like a line of black mold.

'We
 saw it was coming from the bottom. We flipped it over and seemed to be a
 rat's tail,' Gold, who is dating Valente's niece, told ABC7.

He told the New York Post he saw the rodent's five-inch-long tail still attached to its hindquarters 'bleeding into the cake'.

Images of the cake show a pointed, cord-like appendage baked into the cake, surrounded by black swirls.

Gold said he took the allegedly infested dessert to the law offices of his friend, attorney Ed Yule, who believes the cake had been 'tampered with'.

'I personally am of the opinion that this cake was tampered with,' Yule said. 'What's King Kullen have to say about this?'

Yule said he plans to turn the cake over
 to state officials for testing, with the New York Post reporting the 
family is considering whether to file a lawsuit.

Meanwhile, Lloyd Singer, a spokesman for the Commack store, said the outlet had no known rodent issues and the store was conducting an 'internal investigation'.

'King Kullen has had in-store bakeries for over 30 years and there has never been a case of a rodent in one of our store-baked cakes,' he said.

King Kullen also issued a statement.

'Product has been removed from the bakery and the premises has undergone
 a thorough inspection. There are no known safety or rodent issues in 
this bakery,' the company said.

Gold said his uncle was not hospitalized.
