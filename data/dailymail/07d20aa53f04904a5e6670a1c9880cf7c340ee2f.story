For
 decades, Helen Campbell suffered from heavy periods and nosebleeds. Her
 periods could last for 21 days and, as a result, she developed severe 
anaemia, leaving her exhausted.

Then, one morning in 2007, she 
suffered a nosebleed so severe, she had to be rushed to hospital for a 
blood transfusion. She had woken up to find her top drenched in blood. 
'I'd had a nosebleed in the night, but this was no ordinary nosebleed; 
it looked like a scene from a horror film,' says Helen, 42, a former NHS
 administrator from Leeds. 

Usually, if Helen suffered nosebleeds 
during the night as she slept on her back, the blood draining into her 
throat would choke her, making her wake up in time.

Helen Campbell from Leeds, West Yorkshire, who has blood clottiong disorder von Willebrand disease

'This time, I'd 
slept on my front. Normally, I'd lose about a third of a pint of blood; 
that morning, it looked like I'd been bleeding for hours. The top 
quarter of the bed was drenched in blood, which soaked the pillows, 
bedding, mattress, even the carpet.

'I staggered to the bathroom, but
 started feeling faint. Seconds later, I collapsed and passed out.'

Helen had lost five pints of blood. doctors said if she'd stayed asleep 
much longer she could have bled to death.

Helen has von Willebrand 
disease, the most common type of blood-clotting disorder. Similar to 
haemophilia, it is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means
 the blood doesn't clot. But, unlike haemophilia, which mainly affects 
men, this also affects a significant number of women, and an estimated 1
 per cent of the population, around 650,000 Britons, have it.

Those 
affected are particularly at risk after surgery, childbirth or injury, 
when they can bleed excessively. Symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding 
gums, bruising easily and heavy periods.

Women tend to suffer more due 
to the bleeding during periods, which also raises risk of anaemia.

Von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency in a blood protein which means the blood doesn't clot

Up
 to one in five women with heavy periods may have a blood-clotting 
problem, and between 10 and 15 per cent of them will have von Willebrand
 disease, says Michael Laffan, professor of haemostasis and thrombosis 
at Imperial College London.

'Lots of women soldier on with heavy 
periods, thinking flooding, passing clots and periods for weeks are 
normal,' he says. 'This is frustrating, as treatments to reduce blood 
flow are available. But a von Willebrand disease diagnosis will not 
occur to most GPs, and awareness is even variable in gynaecology 
clinics.

'Doctors tend to only think of haemophilia when it comes to
 blood-clotting disorders, and that mainly affects men. Potentially 
thousands of people, particularly women, could have this condition and 
would benefit from diagnosis and treatment.'

Liz Carroll, chief 
executive of the Haemophilia Society, a charity for people with bleeding
 disorders, says there may be tens of thousands of people with 
undiagnosed, untreated von Willebrand disease: 'Some experts estimate 
nine out of ten cases are undiagnosed.'

There are three types of von 
Willebrand disease. It is caused by deficiency in a blood protein called
 von Willebrand factor (vWF). With types 1 and 2, patients have low 
levels of the protein; this is not life-threatening, but can cause long,
 heavy periods, bruising, bleeding gums and bleeding after injury or 
surgery.

Type 3, which Helen has, is most serious, as patients have 
no vWF; left untreated, it can be fatal. Von Willebrand disease is 
diagnosed with blood tests to measure vWF levels; more than one test is 
needed as levels vary with stress and activity.

Treatments for heavy 
periods include the contraceptive pill, the Mirena coil (a contraceptive
 device fitted inside the uterus which releases progesterone, a hormone 
that thins the womb lining and reduces menstrual flow) and a drug, 
tranexamic acid, which reduces blood flow by encouraging clotting.

Another
 option is a nasal spray of desmopressin, an artificial version of the 
hormone vasopressin, which boosts the release of stored vWF. it can be 
used to control bleeding in an emergency, or self-administered on the 
heaviest days of a period.

Other treatments include endometrial 
ablation, where a layer of the womb lining is removed to reduce abnormal
 bleeding, or drugs to induce a temporary menopause. 

Patients with 
type 3 need injections of vWF; in severe cases, this is given as a 
preventative treatment. Helen was diagnosed at two, when her adoptive 
mother noticed she bruised easily and bled excessively.  'I bled into my
 joints in childhood and was on crutches and in callipers from age six 
to 12, as it was too painful to bear weight on my joints,' Helen says. 
'It became a nightmare when my periods started at 13. They lasted 21 
days and I'd feel so faint and dizzy, I couldn't go to school. 'I 
developed severe anaemia, which made me exhausted and affected my 
concentration. I was prescribed tranexamic acid and, although it helped 
with nosebleeds and gum bleeding, it didn't improve my periods or joint 
bleeds.'

At times, her anaemia has been so severe, she's been too 
breathless to walk up stairs and had a heart murmur and palpitations, 
where levels of haemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that 
transports oxygen around the body) drop so low, the body is deprived of 
oxygen, and heart and lungs must work harder.

Helen can now self-inject blood-clotting products every 48 hours

Helen nearly died at 
ages seven, 32 and 34 because of excessive blood loss during periods 
and/or nosebleeds. Each time, she received blood transfusions and was 
injected with blood-clotting products. 'There wasn't any preventative 
treatment given then. Now, I can self-inject blood-clotting products 
every 48 hours to reduce the severity of bleeds.' Helen also had an 
endometrial ablation in 2011 which has improved her symptoms.

Kelly 
Ridley, 37, has type 2 and says even this can be debilitating. The 
office manager, who lives in Wakefield with her husband and daughters, 
says her life was ruled by heavy periods for more than 20 years. She was
 diagnosed at seven when blood tests during a bout of measles detected a
 clotting issue. 

'My main symptoms were nosebleeds and bruising 
easily,' she says. 'When my periods started they were heavy and lasted 
three weeks. I tried many drug treatments through my teens and 20s, 
including the Pill and tranexamic acid, but nothing helped.' 

Before 
and after she gave birth, Kelly needed infusions of clotting factor so 
she didn't bleed heavily after birth. Three years ago, she had an 
endometrial ablation, but she still has nosebleeds and bruises easily. 
'Even now, having a tooth out requires a five-day hospital stay, as I 
need treatment with clotting factors. I can't take anti-inflammatory 
painkillers, including ibuprofen and aspirin, as there is a risk these 
drugs can cause bleeding in my stomach.'

As Liz Carroll says, while 
symptoms are not usually life-threatening, 'they can massively affect 
quality of life. heavy periods can have a big impact: some women get 
very tired and anaemic, others won't leave the house as they are scared 
of leaks, affecting school and work'.

'Other type 1 and type 2 
patients, including men, may have no symptoms. but it's still important 
to get a diagnosis so they can be treated with clotting factor 
injections if they have a serious bleed.'

Debra Pollard, lead nurse 
in haemophilia at the Royal Free Hospital, London, says heavy periods 
alone wouldn't warrant investigation for bleeding disorder. 'But if 
you've had heavy periods from the first one, suffer nosebleeds, 
prolonged bleeding from injuries or dental work, bleeding gums or bruise
 easily, then being referred for investigation may be advisable, 
particularly if family members have similar symptoms.'
