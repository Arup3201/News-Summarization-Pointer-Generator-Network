For most people, the prospect of eating Christmas dinner while holed up in the garden shed would not be an enticing one.

But for John Siggins, 62, the experience last year was one of luxury after he transformed his lean-to into a precise imitation of the dining room found on the Titanic.

The railway engineer, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has spent up to £10,000 turning the tiny structure into a replica of the lavish room - made famous in the 1997 film about the doomed ship.

John Siggins, 62,  is so pleased with his replica of the Titanic's dining room that he even ate his Christmas dinner in there last year

The railway engineer, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has spent thousands turning the tiny structure into an exact copy of the lavish room - made famous in 1997 film Titanic

He has claimed that his creation could be worth ten times that to the right collector.

The corrugated-iron shed features wooden panels, chairs and dining sets from the ship's sister liner, the Olympic - all of which Mr Siggins has collected over 25 years.

Assembled completely by hand, the idea for the project first came about after he was gifted an original blanket handed to a rescued passenger when the ship sunk in 1912.

Mr Siggins was at a library researching a family who had been on the Titanic when an elderly man sitting next to him recognised the name of a survivor he was reading about - Julia Cavendish.

The same name was printed on an old blanket that the man unwittingly had at home - which he had acquired through inheritance. 

As soon as the man mentioned the link, Mr Siggins offered to buy the blanket. 

Speaking about the various trinkets he has collected over the years, he said 'It's history - I buy it all because it's close to my heart

Mr Siggins said: 'He said I could have it. He told me he wasn't bothered about money and that I would make more use of it than he would.'

The blanket was heavily stained and in a state of disrepair but has since been professionally cleaned.

He added: 'It is the main thing that got me going on the project. I had always enjoyed collecting but this was the thing that made me want to build the shed properly.' 

Speaking about the various trinkets he has collected over the years, he said: 'It's history. I buy it all because it's close to my heart and this is how I want to see it.  

'When I get all of the building sorted I want to start an archive - that's my aim and my ambition.' 

Mr Siggins has spent thousands of pounds renovating the lean-to (pictured left) after being inspired by the gift of a blanket (right) which was originally given to a survivor of the Titanic upon being rescued

Mr Siggins has since researched the story of Julia Cavendish - the woman who first owned the blanket.

She had been married to Tyrell Cavendish - nephew of Emily Mundy of Markeaton Hall - who died when the ship sank in 1912.

Mrs Cavendish had been one of the lucky ones to get a space on a lifeboat and was ultimately rescued by the crew of the RMS Carpathia.

Many of the items found in the renovated shed have come from the Titanic's sister liner, the Olympic 

People were given blankets to prevent and combat hypothermia and Mrs Cavendish kept this with her for the rest of her life.

After she died, her blanket was inherited by the anonymous man who John met in the library.

Unaware of its significance, he was close to throwing the blanket away before John offered to buy it.
