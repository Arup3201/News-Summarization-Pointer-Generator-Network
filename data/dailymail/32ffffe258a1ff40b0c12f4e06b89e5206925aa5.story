The owners and visitors of a southern California pet shop have been happily reunited with their mascot, a female iguana named Godzilla who was stolen from the store's courtyard.

Paramount Pet Entertainment's store in  Los Angeles appealed for help after its mascot, the seven-year-old reptile, was stolen  in broad daylight on Monday.

Store surveillance cameras captured video of a man reaching down and stealing the three-foot lizard up from the store's courtyard just after 12.30pm.

Media coverage of the theft helped lead to Godzilla's return after a nearby pet shop owner who bought the lizard for $200 saw the news and gave it back, Paramount Pet's Holly Cepeda told Daily Mail Online.

Godzilla the iguana has been returned to Paramount Pet Entertainment's store in Los Angeles by a nearby pet shop owner after being stolen Monday

A man was caught on camera dipping down to the ground and stealing Godzilla from the store owned by Holly Cepeda and her family

The lizard was sold to a store 15 minutes from Mrs Cepeda's for $200 and returned after the buyer realized it was stolen

The store appealed for help in identifying the thief, who took the iguana back to his Dodge Charger before entering another shop

'My whole family is happy,' the store owner said after she saw the lizard again and it crawled up her husband's leg.

A pet store about 15 minutes drive away from Mrs Cepeda's contacted the family-owned store Wednesday morning around 9.30am after he saw coverage of the iguana theft.

Paramount Pets plans on fully reimbursing the owner of the shop, who did not want his store or himself identified. 

Mrs Cepeda said that she was anxious when driving over to find her pet, but was able to recognize the animal instantly after seeing her.

The animal was cold, and its owners believe that the thief did not feed the iguana.  

Video footage of a mustachioed man taking the three and a half pound animal back to his car, a new gray Dodge Charger, circulated around Los Angeles after Monday's theft.

Both thief and iguana remained at large after authorities pulled the man and lizard over for a traffic citation, but let them go because the police report had not yet been filed, Mrs Cepeda said.

The store made a report and asked for assistance from the public in identifying the thief, who has dark hair with a widow's peak and was wearing baggy clothes. 

Paramount Pets uses their reptiles in shows for schools and parties and said that Godzilla is 'priceless'

Godzilla, a seven-year-old female iguana, has her own Instagram account where her owners  asked for help finding her

Godzilla, which acts as the store's mascot and has an Instagram account, is sometimes petted by visitors who come to see her when she spends the daytime hours outside. 

Owners had hoped that spreading the story in the community would 'touch someone's heart and they bring her back'.

Mrs Cepeda speculates that the thief probably tried to get rid of the lizard as soon as he could after the story was picked up by local news outlets. 

Video footage showed Godzilla fighting back against her kidnapper, who entered nearby shops both before and after putting the iguana in his car.

The lizard, who generally not like being picked up, is seen scratching and whipping its tail at the man while being taken from her home.  

Iguanas are listed on Paramount Pet's website for $450, though Godzilla's owners told CBS Los Angeles that their pet is 'priceless'.

The store also shows off its reptiles in performances at schools and birthday parties and Mrs Cepeda said that Godzilla 'will be a little bit more famous' at the performances.

'I'm going to keep a good eye on her from now on.' 

Mrs Cepeda said that the thief had been seen with an iguana two hours before they made a police report
