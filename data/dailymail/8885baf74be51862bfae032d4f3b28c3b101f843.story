A newly married couple found an uninvited but very welcome guest at their nuptials.

As they left the Registrar's Office at Ayr Town Hall Private Barry Rooney and his new wife Kirstie met the Prince of Wales who was at a civic reception in the same building.

The prince who was in Ayr for a parade by the Queen's Own Yeomanry, of which he is the Royal Honorary Colonel offered his congratulations to the couple and posed for some special photographs for their wedding album.

Pte Rooney, 28, and his 22-year-old wife, from Patna in East Ayrshire, said: ‘That was absolutely amazing, we were really shocked. Who can say they had their wedding photograph taken with the Prince of Wales?

‘It's a day we'll remember forever.’

Earlier in the day, the prince who is the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland took a royal salute from the regiment as they marched through Ayr town centre.

Dressed in multi-terrain Army uniform, the prince then attended an honorary freedom ceremony for the regiment at the Auld Kirk in the town before the civic reception with soldiers and their families.
