The North-South divide is blurred in Prestbury, where the multi-millionaire footballers of the two great Manchester clubs make their homes.

There is a scent in the air as you drive along its sunken lanes, not only that autumnal blend of burning wood and rotting leaves — but of money.

This Cheshire village, a few miles north of Macclesfield, is one of the richest places outside the South-East of England — part of a triangle of wealth formed with the nearby settlements of Wilmslow and Alderley Edge.

Coleen Rooney has object to 'affordable' houses being built near to her eight-bedroom mansion in Prestbury 

Coleen, wife of England and Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, wrote an angry letter to the council about the plans

Mrs Rooney grew up in a rough area of Croxteth in Liverpool, but has objected to 'affordable' homes being built

There are some cheaper houses in Prestbury — think £900,000-plus for a four-bedroom bungalow — but very few are ‘affordable’ in the sense the Government means: ones that young couples on average incomes have enough money to buy.

So when a local developer suggested building five ‘affordable homes’ as part of a small ‘executive’ development — 15 houses in total — on the outskirts of the village, it might be expected that its more fortunate inhabitants, particularly those from humble backgrounds, would be in favour of the plan.

After all, Coleen Rooney, wife of Manchester United and England captain Wayne, knows what a struggle life can be. Her mum was a nursery nurse who grew up in a rough area of Croxteth in Liverpool.

And today, even though the Rooneys’ home on the outskirts of the village is a mansion worth about £5 million, they must remember the days before their world transmuted into an endless round of Caribbean holidays, Bentleys — and disappointing England performances.

But do they want affordable homes for people from similar backgrounds as themselves to be built near them and lived in by people not unlike themselves? Certainly not!

‘Let’s not ruin our village,’ Mrs Rooney wrote this week in a letter to her local planning authority, Cheshire East Council. ‘The development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land.’

She went on to warn of the dangers of increased traffic and damage to the ‘special landscape, character and appearance of the area’.

In a show of support that points to the village’s unusual make-up, Mrs Rooney was supported by the wife of glam-rock band Slade’s frontman Noddy Holder. The Holders are long-standing residents of Prestbury and live on the same secluded cul-de-sac as the Rooneys.

‘Prestbury is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting,’ wrote Suzan Holder.

On Thursday, the council planning committee threw out the offending application, though it may yet be resubmitted.

All very well — except that when it comes to altering the ‘special landscape, character and appearance of the area’ the Rooneys have form.

Coleen Rooney has hit out at plans to build 15 homes on Green Belt land (pictured), just yards from her £12million Cheshire mansion (circled)

Mrs Rooney’s concern for the green belt, expressed in suspiciously legalistic language, is no doubt sincere.

But some may be tempted to accuse her of, at best, nimby-ism and, at worst, double standards.

As Richard Morris, a surveyor advising the thwarted developers Harvey Wood, says: ‘There is a contradiction. The Rooneys’ house is like a mini office building and it seems slightly strange that they should object to what is a very sympathetic development on adjoining land.’

In architectural terms, the Rooneys’ house, completed in 2005, is a sprawling, characterless pile of the kind to be seen in many a faceless gated community in America.

The three-storey mansion boasts all the toys a star footballer would expect — swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, cinema — and all the style of one of the cheaper Las Vegas themed hotels.

Grecian columns and gold bath taps are said to grace the interior — but who really knows? Outside, the 20 acres of grounds are surrounded by high perimeter walls studded with security cameras.

There is nothing pretty about the house dubbed Wayne’s World, and no one in their right mind could describe it as being in sympathy with that ‘special landscape’ so treasured by Mrs Rooney.

There is also the fact that it replaced a perfectly adequate and less obtrusive five-bedroom property of 1930s vintage. In this, the Rooneys represent part of a controversial trend. The golden couple’s arrival in Prestbury presaged an influx of footballers, mainly from Manchester United and Manchester City and all stupendously well-paid and able to afford rocketing asking prices.

Peter Crouch, Wes Brown and Carlos Tevez have lived in the village at various times. The former England cricketer Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff is another well-known resident.

Of course, it wasn’t just footballers who turned this corner of Cheshire into a British Beverly Hills, but they played their part. One by one, perfectly good houses in the Prestbury-Alderley area were torn down to be replaced by palaces of varying degrees of ghastliness.

You see them as you drive around: partially hidden behind gates, walls and hedges, but still hideous — and most definitely not in sympathy with a beautiful landscape, framed in the east by the Peak District.

At its height in 2008, the mansion-building splurge prompted Thelma Jackson, a veteran Conservative councillor, to call a halt.

The plans, submitted to Cheshire East Council, would see five 'affordable' homes built on Green Belt land

‘Since Wayne Rooney moved into the village it’s been a snowball effect,’ she said. ‘Some of the houses do need pulling down, but the houses they’re building to replace them are just so huge. They are going up to three storeys high. It’s destroying the character of the village.’

The style of the new homes has not been the only issue — their inhabitants’ behaviour continues to draw criticism.

Don Foden, a member of Prestbury Parish Council, says that the footballers ‘don’t take part in the village. They live behind locked gates; they close themselves off from day one.’

There is also suspicion over their enthusiasm for the knock-downs and rebuilds. Building costs on new homes are not subject to VAT, which would add 20 per cent to the bill.

‘There is another story to this,’ says Mr Foden. ‘If you modernise a house, you pay VAT on it; if you build a new house, you don’t. So there is a financial advantage to knock-down and rebuild over renovation.’

There is, of course, an argument that such wealthy residents must bring much-needed funds to what could be a sleepy country village.

But stroll down Prestbury’s pretty High Street, past the parish church towards the Admiral Rodney pub, and there are a disturbing number of For Sale and To Let signs adorning empty shops and offices.

‘Footballers and celebrities tend to spend their money out of the area rather than in it,’ says Bill Livesley, a member of Cheshire East Council.

While he says Coleen Rooney does occasionally use the local Co-op — as does Freddie Flintoff — in his eyes, Prestbury has altered over the past 10 or 15 years.

‘I do appreciate it’s difficult for Wayne Rooney to walk up and down the street because he gets people coming up and asking him for autographs.

‘People like him live a more protected life. But, unfortunately, it is changing the village. It’s changing it away from a community.’

The actor Charlie Lawson, who plays Jim McDonald in Coronation Street and runs a farm shop in the village, begs to differ. Other well-known residents do contribute to local life, he says.

Coleen Rooney, pictured on another holiday in Barbados, where she and Wayne own a second home, objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would 'ruin' her village

‘Coleen and her husband support the village shops and, when they’re around, they go to the local Indian restaurant,’ he says.

‘Freddie Flintoff comes in our shop most days and he drinks in the pub. [Former footballer turned BBC pundit] Robbie Savage shops with us. [Sunderland player] Wes Brown shops with us, as does the wife of [Manchester City captain] Vincent Kompany.’

As for the Rooneys’ stubborn stance on the housing plans, he says: ‘It’s not nimby-ism — they have every right to object.’

Maybe, but it may seem to outsiders like one planning law for some and another law for others.

Certainly, those who live in the shadow of the vast new mansions find it impossible to ignore the area’s celebrity status.

‘We who have lived here for a long time are both amused by it and morbidly fascinated by it, but it also intrudes into our daily lives,’ says John Wallace, a resident of Alderley.

‘I’m sure it keeps property prices high and provides employment — but then you have the house building.’

The strength of feeling even prompted him to write a poem about it, which has been published on the website of the local residents’ group.

Naming no names, the verses describe ‘a house like an office block’ — a vast concrete- and-glass monstrosity surrounded by gates and ‘walls like Stalag Luft Eleven’.

The problem, of course, it that ‘though neighbours think it’s as ugly as sin, a footballer thinks that it’s heaven’.
