This summer is set to see a bloody revolution - with the red-hot tipple of choice being the Bloody Mary cocktail.

Bartenders across Britain are hailing the tomato and vodka concoction as the hottest drink of 2013 - and the spike in popularity is thanks to Great Gatsby fever.

Premiering on May 15 at the Cannes Film Festival, Baz Lurhmann's hotly anticipated film is set during the jazz age, when the Bloody Mary was first mixed.

The Prohibition era saw speakeasys become the high of fashion - and cocktails were key - with powerful flavoured mixers used to mask the taste of bootlegged booze.

Ninety years on our love affair with dimly lit drinking dens and the spicy and salty Bloody Mary continues.

Thanks to Leonardo Di Caprio, Tobey McGuire and Carey Mulligan - the stars of latest adaptation of The Great Gatsby – you won't just be drinking it with your eggs benedict.  

Andrew Webster, co-founder of nightlife DesignMyNight.com says: 'As with the history of many classic cocktails, the origin of the Bloody Mary is widely debated.

'Some claim it was crafted by bartender 
Fernand Petiot in 1921 at the famous Harry's New York Bar in Paris, a 
favourite with American expats including author Fitzgerald, while others
believe a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the 
Bucket of Blood was the creator.

A Bloody Mary 'it's packed with veggies, so we count it towards one of your five a day'

'Either way, the drink has exploded in popularity across the UK. It's no longer only seen as a modern hair-of-the-dog hangover cure but has attracted the attention of mixologists who are rethinking the recipe ahead of the summer.

Plus, it's packed with veggies, so we count it towards one of your five a day.'

And the hearty savoury drink is starting to move from brunch to all day bar menus.

Head Barman at The Sanderson Hotel's Long Bar, Thierry Brocher says: 'It is the perfect cocktail as its one of those drinks you can enjoy any time of the day, even for breakfast without feeling guilty.

The magic and mandatory ingredient is Horseradish, it bring more texture to the drink and helps blending all ingredients together, also 5ml of tio pepper makes a difference. 

'But if you're bored of the traditional recipe, there are numerous variations on the drink from The Bloody Maria with tequila to the infamous Red Snapper with gin.'

Leeds bar Revolution Electric Press have also seen a surge in orders for the tomato-based tipple. Joe Mitchell, Deputy Manager at Revolution's Electric Press venue in Leeds, says: 'The Bloody Mary is a classic cocktail served all over the world.

'It's also a versatile drink, which 
can be tailored to your own tastes, whether it's a little extra kick of 
Tobasco or a particular brand of Vodka you like.

And vodka as a whole is
experiencing a resurgence in popularity as people become more 
experimental with their drink selections.

'The
beauty of the Bloody Mary is its versatility so you'll find every bar 
has its own take on the classic recipe. The era of cocktail glamour is 
most certainly coming back, people are becoming more educated on spirits
and so we're constantly updating our own recipes to ensure we're ahead 
of the new trends.'

Bloodshot Vodka is a new British premium spirit created by chef and food and drinks writer, Mark Douglas Hill with the golden jazz era very much its inspiration.

A fiery fusion of exotic spices, hot peppers and aromatics, It combines the smoothest taste with an edgy character, which makes it the ingredient of choice for the true Bloody Mary connoisseur.

Distilled using only the finest English wheat, Bloodshot is created through combining both traditional and cutting edge techniques, and retails at £19.95.

The primary distillation takes place in the UK’s most state-of-the-art still followed by a second distillation through Angela, a 108-year-old copper pot still that breathes life, character and texture into the premium spirit. 

Bloodshot has a fiery side due to the maceration process that follows, when it is infused with a carefully balanced blend of spices, aromatics and botanicals, including: smoky chipotle chilies, cracked black pepper, lemon peel, horseradish root, coriander seed, hot cayenne pepper and celery seed.

The devilish spirit is then blended with lemon and lime, Worcestershire Sauce and award-winning Port from the Douro Valley. After three weeks of maturing, it passes through a four-step filtration process finishing with its distinctive deep red colour.
