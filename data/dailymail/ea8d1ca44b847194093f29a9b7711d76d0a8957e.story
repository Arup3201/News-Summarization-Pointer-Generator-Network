It was once one of the dirtiest and most polluted rivers in the UK - but the River Tyne is now the best in England and Wales for salmon.

Over the past few decades the murky waters of the river have been transformed into a haven for wildlife - including thousands of salmon.

A vast improvement in the quality of the previously heavily-polluted water has made as huge difference to conditions for the fish, combined with the introduction of baby salmon - or parr - from a nearby hatchery.

Images of salmon leaping up the fresh waters of the River Tyne are a far cry from pictures showing the river's grim industrial past.

For centuries the river was choked with filth because it was used as a major route for the export of coal, from the 13th century until the decline of the coal mining industry in north-east of England in the second half of the 20th century.

Anne Woodcock, of FishPal, which sells day passes for fishing on the river, said: 'The grading of rivers is based on statistical evidence obtained from Fish Counters and Catch Results of the number of salmon running the river.

'The River Tyne tops this list in England and Wales for salmon and is second in England for sea trout.

'Many people believe that this is the result of two factors, the improvement in quality of water in the river Tyne and the stocking of the river with salmon parr.'

A far cry: The River Tyne in its industrial heyday

Thanks to conservation efforts, many major UK waterways have been transformed

Many of the UK's rivers have undergone an astonishing reversal of fortunes in just a few decades.

Not long ago many were little more than foul-smelling conduits for sewage and industrial waste - in the 60s the River Thames was declared 'biologically dead' and if anyone fell in, authorities would have to quarantine them.

Now, thanks to the decline of heavy industry, stricter legislation and conservation efforts, many are once again teeming with species of fish, birds and other wildlife.

The Thames now has roughly 125 species of 
fish, while more than 400 species of invertebrates live in the mud, 
water and river banks. It now ranks among the cleanest metropolitan 
tideways in the world.
