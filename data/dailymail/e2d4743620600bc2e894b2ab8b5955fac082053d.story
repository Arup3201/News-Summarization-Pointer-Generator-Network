Five men have died in a cargo ship collision which caused a 450-tonne boat to capsize.

Coastguards found five bodies inside the Eifuku Maru No. 18, which overturned off the coast of Japan after crashing into the much larger Jia Hui, which weighs 2,687 tonnes.

Divers, helicopters and coastguard patrol boats are still searching for one missing man who was on the Eifuku Maru.

Capsized: The Eifuku Maru No. 18 capsized off the coast of Japan this morning

Search: The coastguard in Japan is looking for six men who are missing after the Eifuku Maru capsized

Rescue: Members of the coastguard are seen checking for survivors on the upturned hull of the Eifuku Maru

The crash - which is still unexplained - took place early this morning seven miles west of Izu Oshima Island, near Tokyo.

There
was initially hope that all six men could be alive, but the coastguard 
later confirmed they had found five bodies with no pulse inside the boat
the same afternoon.

The lost crewmen included skipper Shingo
Okawa, 62, and deputy skipper Tomokai Takai, 40, though it is now 
unclear which men have been found and who is still missing.

The crew of the Jia Hui, twelve Chinese people and a Malaysian, are believed to be safe and unharmed by the accident.

Aftermath: The Jia Hui is seen in the foreground while the upturned Eifuku Maru, attended by a coastguard patrol boat, is visible in the distance

They were being questioned this afternoon on board the ship about the incident.

It is still not known what exactly caused the crash.

The capsized Eifuku Maru, registered in Japan, had almost reached its destination of Ichikawa, Japan, having come from the small Sado Island.

The Jia Hui, which is registered in Sierra Leone, had not long begun its journey from Kawasaki, near Tokyo, towards Busan in South Korea.
