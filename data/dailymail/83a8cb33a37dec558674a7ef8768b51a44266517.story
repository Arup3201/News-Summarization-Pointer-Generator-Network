Crown court recorder Frank Abbott spoke of his exasperation at people who get drunk and end up in a fight, which 'usually happens in the kebab shop'

A top judge has admitted he used to go skinny dipping while drunk as he hit out at modern day binge drinking.

Crown court recorder Frank Abbott spoke about his own experiences as he sentenced two men for a drunken late-night assault.

He mentioned his exasperation at people who get drunk and end up in a fight, which 'usually happens in the kebab shop', while sentencing Oliver Spearey, 29, and Andrew 
Martin, 36, for actual bodily harm.

Mr Abbott said: 'When I was a student - these people have no idea what binge drinking was like - we weren't violent.

'We would go shinning up a telegraph pole then went naked in the swimming pool, but we didn't go around punching each other.'

Mr Abbott said it was now a typical scene witnessed in high streets up and down Britain.

He said: 'It usually happens in the kebab shop when someone is in the queue and says "are you looking at my bird?" or whatever, and they look at it later on CCTV and say "is that me? I can't remember doing that".'

'These things happen for no reason at all and nobody can remember what the problem was.

'It's unfortunate there's not a way of getting people together to shake hands and say "we're very sorry about what happened".'

Bristol Crown Court heard how the pair had been drinking lager, vodka, whisky and Jaeger bombs for ten hours before the assault on December 22 last year.

CCTV from a Subway branch in Bristol captured the fight break out at around 3.10am.

Spearey, of Yatton, north Somerset, punched a man called Kami Asgarfard in the face and was then hit by an unknown bystander.

He picked up a chair and started to chase the man but was stopped by victim Samuel Gold, who was then punched in the face by Martin and knocked to the ground.

As he curled up in a ball to protect himself, Spearey hit him on the back with the chair and Martin rained in more punches.

Mr Gold suffered a cut mouth, black eye and bruised back.

Spearey and Martin, of Saltford near Bristol, both admitted ABH and Spearey admitted an additional charge of assault.

The court heard that the defendants were 'very sorry and ashamed' of their actions but had little memory of the incident.

Describing
the violence as 'shocking', Recorder Mr Abbott ordered both defendants 
to do 100 hours' of unpaid work in the next 18 months.

Spearey must pay £450 in compensation and Martin must pay £350.

Mr Abbott, a barrister with Pump Court chambers, which has bases in London, Winchester and Swindon, has been a crown court recorder since 1991.

His biography on the chambers' website reads: Frank has an extensive practice in criminal and civil law, including negligence fraud, landlord and tenant and animal welfare.

'He is well known for his powerful advocacy, his humanity and kindness and is extremely well liked for his consolatory and dignified approach to his duties to the court as well as being tenacious in the interests of the client.

'He has long experience in resolving disputes and political issues at the bar in particular membership of the Bar Council fees committee helping to pioneer the introduction of the graduated fee system for legal aid.

'Of the matters in which he has mediated, all have come to a successful conclusion.'
