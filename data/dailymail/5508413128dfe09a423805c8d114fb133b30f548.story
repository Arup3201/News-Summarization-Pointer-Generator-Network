Authorities say a Utah mom has pleaded guilty for taking nude pictures of her 13-year-old daughter so that she could text them to an older man.

The Deseret News reports that the 35-year-old Duchesne County woman took the photos because her daughter didn't know how to use the camera on an Iphone.

Court documents show that the 31-year-old Daniel Dean Divine, a family friend living in Oregon, had sent the teenager the phone and asked her to send him nude photos.

'Family friend': Daniel Dean Divine is accused of soliciting naked pictures from a 13-year-old girl. Three photos were taken by the girl's mother

The charges claim that: '(The girl) stated she realized Daniel was older and wanted to have sex, so she took the photos just to keep him happy.'

'(The girl) asked her mother to take the photos of her when she could not figure out how to make the camera on the iPhone work.'

Police said the girl's mother agreed to her daughter's request, taking three nude photos of the teen.

The mother told investigators that her daughter and the man planned to wait until she was 18 to begin a sexual relationship.

Behind bars: Devine remains in Duchesne County Jail. His next court appearance is set for December 20

The girl's mother pleaded guilty to one count of child abuse on Thursday. She faces a possible sentence of up to five years in prison when she is sentenced on February 14.

The Deseret News reported that as part of her plea agreement with prosecutors, the girl's mother has agreed to testify against Divine.

Divine remains in jail on three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and one count of enticing a minor over the Internet. His next court appearance is scheduled for December 20.

The mother's name is being withheld to protect the identity of her daughter.
