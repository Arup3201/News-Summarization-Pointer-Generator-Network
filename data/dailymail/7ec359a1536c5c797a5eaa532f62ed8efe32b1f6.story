After problems with travellers trying to set themselves up in a public park over the summer, a council took the step of locking the main gates to keep them out.

But, as a fresh convoy of 30 caravans arrived, such common sense was clearly no match for the warped logic of health and safety.

Astonishingly, officials decided to unlock the vehicle access gate – because they were worried the intruders might hurt themselves during their efforts to get in.

Open season: The gate which was erected to keep travellers out has now been opened amid health and safety fears

Setting up camp: Scores of caravans are now settled across Wild Park near Brighton

Advice: Police had warned the council that it was not safe for travellers to keep trying to access the site around the barrier

The travellers duly made themselves at
home – and because the council voluntarily let them in, police have 
lost all powers to evict them.

Taxpayers
will instead now have to fund a lengthy civil court battle to throw out
the intruders from Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton.

The
farce emerged in a leaked confidential email by Brighton and Hove 
Council to councillors. It said: ‘After the initial trespass was 
reported, Sussex Police highlighted the dangerous nature with which the 
group were accessing the field.

‘As
such a decision was taken to open the access gate to reduce the risk to
road users and to stop the occupants from crossing the pavement to 
access the road.’

Local 
residents say they are now unable to use the park, Brighton and Hove’s 
largest local nature reserve, and fear it could become ‘a new Dale 
Farm’, the illegal Essex camp of 1,000 travellers which cost millions of
pounds to break up.

Delighted: Travellers have set up camp at Wild Park, Brighton, after being let into the site by council officials

Crazy: Critics have described the decision to open the gate and let travellers in as 'madness'

At the
start of the summer, the council padlocked the gates to Wild Park after
itinerants had to be removed. About 30 caravans arrived and the 
travellers, determined to gain access, repeatedly drove over pavements 
and mounds designed as obstructions.

It was then, last week, that the 
Green Party-led council decided to open the gates to reduce risk to the 
public and the travellers themselves. More than 30 caravans are now 
camped on the land, with more feared over the weekend.

Inspector
Bill Whitehead of Sussex Police said if the gates had remained locked, 
any travellers could have been evicted immediately because they would 
have been committing an offence under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice
and Public Order Act. But because the council had let them in, the 
section no longer applies.

Tory
councillor Dawn Barnett said last night: ‘The council is mad. They have
opened the flood gates. The kids who live nearby can’t play in the park
any more because it’s not safe. I am terrified it may turn into another
Dale Farm.’

One traveller, 
60-year-old Mary Long, said: ‘We have been to this site before. They 
haven’t opened the gate for us before but they did on Tuesday. The 
council here are helpful.’

A council spokesman said: ‘The council has initiated legal proceedings to evict the travellers.’

Problem: Around 100 caravans parked up in Wild Park in 2011. Councillors fear even more will come now

Fears: Residents are worried that the open gate will lead to influx of travellers and long legal battle similar to the one at Dale Farm (pictured)
