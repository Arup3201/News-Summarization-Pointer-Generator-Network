The last Briton held in Guantanamo Bay has dropped his torture case against MI6 in a move which could pave the way for his return to the UK.

Shaker Aamer has been imprisoned at the US naval base in Cuba for 12 years after he was arrested by Afghan militias working for the Americans shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

For the past three years, Scotland Yard detectives have been investigating claims that he was tortured in Afghanistan and that British interrogators working for MI6 were present.

He alleges one British officer watched while US soldiers banged his head against a wall. But in a dramatic development, Mr Aamer has written to the Metropolitan Police telling them to drop the investigation.

In his letter, Mr Aamer, whose family live in South London, says he does not want any MI6 officer to be punished for the torture he suffered because he believes the agents were only following orders from Whitehall.

British Guantanamo detainees have been paid up to £20 million in compensation by the Government.

It is not known whether Mr Aamer or his family have also received compensation but his decision not to testify will not affect any settlement.

Mr Aamer told The Mail on Sunday he hoped that by dropping his claims against the UK Government, MI6 would in turn drop their objections to his release.

He said: ‘I have many reasons for dropping the criminal complaint against the MI6 agents who were present when I was being tortured.

‘How can you punish a lowly agent when the real fault lies with someone far above him, possibly even the Foreign Secretary of the time or the Prime Minister, Tony Blair?

‘But I also hope that by taking away the threat of my being a witness, with them in the dock, MI6 will stop being fearful and paranoid, and trying to have me remain in Guantanamo Bay after all these years.’

The case is the last remaining criminal investigation against the security and intelligence services involving British detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

A team of Scotland Yard detectives officers flew out to Cuba last year to interview Mr Aamer about his allegations. Last night the Foreign Office said it would continue to negotiate Mr Aamer’s release but that the ultimate decision was with the Americans.

Mr Aamer faces no charges of terrorism and was cleared for release from Guantanamo in 2007 by the then President, George  W. Bush.

In his graphic accounts of his torture at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, he details how he was subjected to the medieval abuse known as the ‘strappado’, devised by the Spanish Inquisition.

‘The US soldiers,’ says Mr Aamer, ‘would tie my wrists together and then hang me with either my feet just touching the ground or even just off the ground.

‘This would gradually result in the dislocation of the shoulders in a way that was excruciating.’

Mr Aamer alleges British intelligence continued to interrogate him after he was taken from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, when UK spy chiefs were fully aware of the tortures being carried out there.

Mr Aamer’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith said: ‘Both Shaker and I know that the actions of MI6 continue to be an important reason why he is still in Guantanamo. I hope they will back off now, and stop stabbing him in the back.’

Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son who was born after his capture in Afghanistan, says his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London.

Last night a spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘Mr Aamer’s case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released as a matter of urgency.’

Scotland Yard declined to comment.
