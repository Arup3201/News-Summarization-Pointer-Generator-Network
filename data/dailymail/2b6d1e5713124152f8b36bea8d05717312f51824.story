They are Peppa Pig biscuits that should probably come with a XXX rating.

A bakery obviously saw the chance to jump on the bandwagon and dished up the treats for sale on its shelves to catch the eye of passing kids.

But the snacks that came out of the oven, complete with a drooping pink nose, beady eyes and a beaming smile, might be considered unsuitable for children.

Peppa Pig biscuits came out more phallic than anything shoppers might want to buy for their children

George Hughes, a trainee accountant who lives in London, snapped the rude snacks and posted his photo on Facebook.

George, 21, wrote on his page: ‘So I found these “Peppa pig” cookies in a bakery … They make me feel uncomfortable.’

He had been in holiday in Yorkshire when he came across the suggestive biscuits in a store there.

Twitter users this evening gave a mixed reaction over the design of the treats.

Peppa Pig is a cartoon character - but nobody expected that phallic like biscuits would be name in its image ...

Another, Ciara Curran @CiaraOnly1, wondered: ‘Are these the worst Peppa Pig biscuits ever made?’

The suggestively shaped snacks came just a day after a Tesco range of milk cartons raised eyebrows.

Shoppers in the supermarket chain’s Irish branches were left bewildered when packaging for the buttermilk range in stores there went on sale.

The male genitalia like design that stared down from the supermarket’s shelves was more likely to send consumers scarpering up the aisle than reaching for the milk.
