CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield. 

For half an hour here on Tuesday night we saw the embodiment of the vision Brendan Rodgers talked about when he arrived at Anfield two-and-a-half seasons ago. Players swarming like red ants towards the Kop. A good team - perhaps the very best in the country - pinned back in their own half. Blitzkrieg football.

That Liverpool didn't win - they didn't do tangibly more than remind Chelsea they remain a team of which they should be very wary - was due to the thickness of a post and the fact that visiting goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is 6ft 7ins tall.

It was Steven Gerrard who struck the post and substitute Adam Lallana who brought a terrific full-length save from the Belgian with a rasping drive from the edge of the penalty area.

This was the kind of football that Rodgers has been waiting for this season. The dextrous, high-tempo full-court press that he drills into his players' brains on a daily basis at their Melwood training base. Through the difficult times of the first half of the season, Rodgers promised this style of play - this relentless rhythm - would return and on Tuesday night it was spectacularly evident during a second half that they dominated.

Liverpool had to come from behind but the statistics show that they should really have won. They had 20 shots as opposed to Chelsea's two, for example, while the only time Liverpool's Simon Mignolet was really examined properly was when Eden Hazard beat him with a penalty in the first half.

This was a night that was good for Liverpool and indeed good for English football. Chelsea need teams other than Manchester City that can genuinely challenge them.

But for Courtois, Liverpool would have won the game against Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday evening 

Had Rodgers' team being facing anyone other than Chelsea - dogged, cussed, resilient Chelsea - and Courtois then they surely would have won and it will be intriguing now to see if Liverpool can go to London next week and dismantle a Chelsea home record that is rather formidable.

Jose Mourinho's team have played 15 games at Stamford Bridge this season. They have won 14 and drawn one. That's the nature of Liverpool's task.

After the final whistle on Tuesday night, Mourinho was perhaps as magnanimous as he gets.

'Liverpool didn't deserve to lose,' he said.

Deep down he will know the truth, though, and it says something for his own team's spirit that they came away with anything at all from this game.

For a spell they were in charge. There was little between the teams for the opening quarter of an hour and, when Hazard scored his penalty, it was easy to wonder if Chelsea would just ease away as they did when they won here 2-1 in the Barclays Premier League last November.

Ultimately, though, Chelsea needed something more than their usual stylish purpose as the game turned around on the back of improved Liverpool football.

They needed some resolution, some endeavour and some mental stubbornness. On nights like this, when the red tide has turned, you simply need a refusal to lose.

It helps if you have a terrific goalkeeper as well and Courtois perhaps showed again  just why he rivals Manchester United's David de Gea as the best in England and perhaps Europe.

The 22-year-old possesses a remarkable confidence and if this was an audition for the No 1 position ahead of Petr Cech for the rest of the season then it is perhaps one he passed.

Steven Gerrard epitomised how Liverpool have improved from earlier in the season

There is an assurance about the Chelsea goalkeeper's work that makes him so difficult to criticise. He does the routine things effortlessly and the difficult things regularly.

In the first half he was only really tested by one Gerrard shot from distance but when Liverpool moved through the gears in the second half they found him all but unpassable.

The goal that did beat him was superb and scored by a wonderful talent. Rodgers will hope that his centre forward Daniel Sturridge returns to fitness soon so that Raheem Sterling can be used where he is most dangerous, running from deep to score like this.

After that it seemed likely that Liverpool would break through again. Chelsea rode their luck at times and the save that Courtois produced from Lallana with a few minutes remaining really was deserving of earning an away draw all on its own.

Ultimately, it was wonderful to see these teams locked in genuine battle once again. The game Chelsea won here to deny Liverpool the title last April was a one-off for its sheer peculiarity while the match back in November saw Liverpool running at half-tilt.

Next week in west London Chelsea will start favourites. They will play better than this. Liverpool will travel in expectation, though. It won't be one to miss.
