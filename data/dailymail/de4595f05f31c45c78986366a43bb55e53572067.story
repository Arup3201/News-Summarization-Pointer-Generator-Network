The owner of a toilet used by Adolf Hitler has revealed he is desperate to sell his piece of history.

The Nazi leader's white porcelain toilet was uncovered last year in fully working order in a car repair garage in New Jersey.

It was originally installed on the Aviso Grille, the official German State yacht, in a room adjacent to Hitler's elaborate throne room on the luxury 433ft long boat.

The Aviso Grille, built in 1935, was the largest yacht in existence at the time and was used regularly by Hitler.

Workers at Greg's Auto Repair in Florence, Burlington County, still use the toilet every day, which is located in a small, plywood walled room.

The one-of-a-kind toilet was found by a previous owner in a nearby scrapyard in 1951.

Current owner Greg Kohfeldt said: 'I was invited on TV to 
sell it on a show dedicated to rare and unusual antiques but one of the 
experts called me evil for trying to sell it.

'The episode was never broadcast. It was a real pain because I had to get the toilet disconnected to take there.

'The toilet is getting a bit long in the tooth now. It still works well, the Germans knew how to build things back then.

'If the right offer came along I'd seriously consider it.'

'Not many people can say they have used the same throne as the most evil man in history, can they?

'There's salvage from the yacht all over town, the toilet was purloined by a previous owner who needed one.

'The local Veterans Association has the map table and one old man has the ship's wheel hanging up in his den.

'People took anything they could find and the guy who built the garage got this.

'There are some words in German on the toilet but nothing else to indicate that the most evil of cheeks were spread upon its seat.

'Nevertheless over the years hundreds of people have popped by to have a look.

'I've never charged admission, I didn't think it was right to do so. If people want to have a look they're more than welcome.'

The years up to the outbreak of  the Second World War saw Hitler take many voyages on his beloved boat which he nicknamed 'The White Swan'.

If Britain had been defeated in the war, Hitler planned to sail up the River Thames and disembark at Whitehall to accept Britain's surrender.

The yacht spent the rest of the war serving as a command ship in the German Navy.

The unique toilet was first sold to a British businessman who failed to make it a tourist attraction.

It was then passed through numerous owners - including the King of Egypt - before ending up on the New Jersey coast to be broken for scrap.

A desk used by Hitler sold for a staggering £250,000 and Mr Kohfeldt is keen to sell the historical toilet.

'I know we haven't cleaned it much, and it's been a man's toilet without the touch of a woman and I seriously doubt there's any Hitler remnants down there after all these years.

'I want to modernise the toilet. Imagine having it in your house, it would definitely be a conversation starter.

'How many people can say they have Hitler's toilet?'
