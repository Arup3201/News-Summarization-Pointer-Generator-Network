The wife of an Army general facing sexual misconduct charges in North Carolina has written an opinion piece in support of her husband, claiming that the stresses of a decade of war contributed to recent high-profile military scandals.

Rebecca Sinclair's husband, Fort Bragg-based Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, faces a long list of charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct, violating orders, engaging in inappropriate relationships and adultery.

Sinclair is accused of forcing women to 
have sex with him during combat tours and threatening at least one 
victim's life, as well as her career and the lives of her relatives if 
she told anyone about his actions.

Charged: Army Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates

Prosecutors allege
 that the married general committed sex crimes against five women 
including four military subordinates and civilian between 2007 and 2012 
in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany.

The 27-year Army 
veteran was deputy commander in charge of logistics and support for the 
82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in 
May.

Rebecca Sinclair's
 piece was published just days after retired Gen. David Petraeus 
admitted having an affair with his biographer and resigned as director 
of the CIA.

During the 
investigation into the affair, the FBI uncovered flirtatious emails 
between Gen. John Allen, the top American commander in Afghanistan, and a
 Florida socialite. Both were married.

Defense: Sinclair's wife of 27 years came to his defense, writing in an op-ed piece that the open-ended wars and years spent apart are partially to blame for sex scandals in the Army

In her 800-word 
piece in The Washington Post published November 15, Rebecca Sinclair 
said that her husband of 27 years spent more than six years in the past 
decade away from his family and that they moved six times in 11 years.

‘Spectators will 
try to make this scandal about many things: the arrogance of powerful 
men; conniving mistresses; the silent epidemic of sexual assault in the 
armed services. But these explanations obscure an underlying problem: 
the devastating influence of an open-ended war – now in its 11th year – 
on the families of U.S. service members,’ she wrote.

Rebecca Sinclair 
said the distance apart isn't an excuse for infidelity. But she said 
this is the only time in history the U.S. has fought for a decade with 
an all-volunteer force.

‘Nothing good can come of families being chronically separated for a decade or more,’ she wrote.
She said many military spouses don't have any good options after finding
 out a husband or wife was unfaithful. If they leave, they risk losing 
the financial security of military salary, pension, housing and health 
benefits.

Spectators will try to make this scandal about many things: the arrogance of powerful men; conniving mistresses; the silent epidemic of sexual assault in the armed services. But these explanations obscure an underlying problem: the devastating influence of an open-ended war — now in its 11th year — on the families of U.S. service members. Let me first address the elephant in the room. My husband had an affair. He violated our marriage vows and hurt me tremendously. Jeff and I are working on our marriage, but that’s our business. The officer corps is plagued by leaders abandoning their families and forging new beginnings with other men and women. And many wives know about their husbands’ infidelity but stay silent. For military wives, the options are bad and worse. Stay with an unfaithful husband and keep your family intact; or lose your husband, your family and the financial security that comes with a military salary, pension, health care and housing.We have moved six times in 11 years. On average, our kids change schools every two years. Between five deployments, site surveys and training operations, Jeff has spent more than six of the past 10 years away from his family. This is the only time in U.S. history that our nation has fought a decade-long war with a volunteer Army. Doing so has consequences. Nothing good can come of families being chronically separated for a decade or more. It will take years for Jeff to shed the false image of a hard-drinking, porn-dependent aggressor. The other generals will also struggle to rehabilitate reputations they spent decades building. All of these men are human beings, with strengths and fallibilities, and they have families who are under real strain.

‘Because we move 
so often, spouses lose years of career advancement,’ she said. ‘Some of 
us spend every other year as single parents. We are vulnerable 
emotionally and financially. Many stay silent out of necessity, not 
natural passivity.’

Rebecca Sinclair 
also wrote that she supports her husband fighting the charges against 
him. She said she thinks many of the charges will be dropped because the
 evidence isn't strong.

‘But the damage 
has been done,’ she writes at the end of her piece. ‘It will take years 
for Jeff to shed the false image of a hard-drinking, porn-dependent 
aggressor. The other generals will also struggle to rehabilitate 
reputations they spent decades building.

‘All of these men 
are human beings, with strengths and fallibilities, and they have 
families who are under real strain. How we address this strain will say 
much about what kind of country we are; it will also determine how 
stable and strong our military is.’

Mrs Sinclair's 
impassioned defense of her husband comes a little more than a week after
 two female Army officers testified that Gen Sinclair had forced them to
 provide him with their nude photos.

A
 married captain testified that Sinclair repeatedly 
asked her to send him nude photos of herself, which she said made her 
uncomfortable.

Eventually, she said she placated the married general by 
sending him downloaded pornographic photos of other women cropped so 
that their faces weren't visible.

The damaging 
testimony came last Wednesday during a hearing at Fort Bragg to 
determine whether Sinclair will go on trial for multiple criminal 
charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual conduct and adultery,
 which is a crime under the military justice system.

The allegations 
against Sinclair involve relationships with five women other than his wife.

On Tuesday a former subordinate to Sinclair testified that her superior
 officer started an affair with her in Iraq and later threatened to kill
 her and her family if she told anyone.

The
 woman says she was honored at first by the attention from Brig. Gen. 
Jeffrey Sinclair, who she said was highly regarded. They first had sex 
in 2008 at a forward operating base in Iraq, she said.

'I
 was extremely intimated by him. Everybody in the brigade spoke about 
him like he was a god,' the woman said, as Sinclair rolled his eyes and 
appeared visibly annoyed during her testimony. 

Now a captain, she was testifying on the second day of a military 
hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C., on whether there is enough evidence to 
court-martial Sinclair on charges including forcible sodomy, wrongful 
sexual conduct and engaging in inappropriate relationships.

Promiscuous: Prosecutors believe Sinclair committed sex crimes against five women in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany

She had earlier testified how he had grabbed her by the neck and forcibly sodomized her.

During the testimony, Sinclair repeatedly rolled his eyes, sighed audibly and stared at his former aide from the defense table. She did not look at him.

The captain testified that she believed Sinclair's threats because he had gone through special forces training, knew how to kill with his hands and had a reputation as a killer in battle.

Sinclair was deputy 
commander in charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne 
Division in Afghanistan before being abruptly relieved in May amid a 
criminal probe. He has been on special assignment since then at Fort 
Bragg, the sprawling base that is home to the 82nd Airborne.

Sinclair's
 former commanding officer, Maj. Gen. James Huggins, testified on Monday
 that he launched the criminal investigation that led to the charges 
after the female captain told him Sinclair forced her to have sex.

Trial continues: Sinclair's trial is now in its third day at Fort Bragg and witnesses continue to come forward

Huggins said that on March 19, the captain came to his office late at night in tears. She reported that she had been involved in a three-year sexual affair with Sinclair, then her direct commander and a married man. Adultery is a crime under the military code of justice.

Huggins said he knew the female officer to be a good soldier whom Sinclair had specifically asked to have transferred under his command.

According to Huggins, the captain said Sinclair had once forced her to perform oral sex on him, but that she also had sex willingly with her boss at Army bases in the United States and on deployments to Germany, Iraq and at the airborne division's headquarters in Afghanistan.

When she had tried to end the affair, Sinclair had threatened her and persisted in pushing for sex, according to Huggins' testimony. But she also told Huggins she finally decided to report Sinclair after finding emails exchanged with other women in his account.

Sinclair is accused of 26 
violations of military law including forcible sodomy, wrongful sexual 
conduct, possessing pornography while deployed and conduct unbecoming of
 an officer.

Sinclair's
 attorney asked for the charges to be thrown out, arguing that 
prosecutors had read confidential emails between the general and his 
defense.

Defense attorney Lt. Col. Jackie Thompson said this violated 
his client's rights and asked that new prosecutors be brought in to try 
the case.
