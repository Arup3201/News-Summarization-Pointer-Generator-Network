Police have evacuated part of a Milwaukee suburb as they search for evidence in Sunday's deadly gun massacre at a Sikh temple.

Officials are concentrating their search on a home in Cudahy, Wisconsin believed to be linked to the unnamed gunman who killed six and left dozens more injured before being shot dead by police.

As they began the investigation, they asked residents of two blocks near the house to leave the area.

The evacuation order is similar to that in Aurora, Colorado less than three weeks ago, when neighbours of shooter James Holmes were forced to leave their homes while police searched the suspect's apartment.

Siege: Police outside a house in Cudahy, Wisconsin believed to belong to the gunman who launched a massacre at a nearby Sikh temple on Sunday morning

Vehicles: The FBI arrived in the neighbourhood with armoured trucks and a bomb disposal unit

Armed: A police officer on high alert outside a home in Cudahy believed to belong to the unidentified shooter

In Cudahy, which is just a few miles away from the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, FBI vehicles pulled up with a dozen agents around 6.30pm, eight hours after the start of the deadly rampage.

Some agents were wearing protective clothing, according to Fox6.

Police were seen entering the top floor of a two-storey duplex, according to locals.

Precaution: Officers were heavily armed as they staked out the suburban house

Evacuation: Local residents were asked to leave the neighbourhood during the investigation

Fire truck: Other emergency vehicles were also standing by as well as workers from the local power company

Residents of the wider area, which is a 
mixture of duplexes and single houses, were told to remain in their 
homes during the search.

As well as the FBI officials, who arrived with an armoured truck, a trailer and other vehicles, a fire truck and an ambulance were seen nearby.

A police spokesman said the department's bomb squad was also on the scene, but had no details on why the unit was called.

Representatives of the local energy company were standing by, apparently so they could cut off the neighbourhood's electricity while police investigated.

Protection: Officials spent hours scouring the scene making sure the temple was safe

Desperate: Victims' relatives search for information in the wake of the massacre

The gunman who attacked a group of Sikhs as they gathered for a Sunday morning service has not yet been identified.

He is said to have been a white male in his 30s.

His motive is not currently known, but police are treating the crime as an act of 'domestic terrorism', apparently based on the shooter's tattoos.
