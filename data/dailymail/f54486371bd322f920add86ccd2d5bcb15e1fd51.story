If you look back wistfully at the Sixties and wish you were there, perhaps it's worth refreshing your memory.

These outrageous adverts were the norm - with men blowing smoke in their wives' faces, stepping on their heads and groping them while they clean the house.

Everything from Volkswagen cars to Kellogg's cereals used a little everyday sexism to brighten up their brands in a time when political correctness wasn't even dreamed up.

Advertisers once played on the fact many saw women as good for little other than shopping. While attitudes have come a long way, recent research suggests many men are still afraid to speak up in support of women

'Some men want to voice their support, but fear that no one will take them seriously, because they lack a vested interest in the cause,' said Professor Grant. Pictured is a sexist vintage advert from Schlitz

Fur-ious: This advert for trousers depicted a woman as a tiger-skin rug, boasting: 'After one look at his Mr Leggs slacks, she was ready to have him walk all over her'. The same would be unlikely to be true now

The big questions: It seems husbands tended to be either half-murderous towards their wives or groping them

Don't buy the wrong coffee! This advert for Chase & Sanborn is light-hearted, but would shock many today

In fact, the phrase 'politically correct' only gained its current meaning in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

That meant these advertisers felt free to be as offensive as they liked - depicting women being spanked and babies telling their mothers to smoke Marlboro cigarettes.

And the spirit of TV hit Mad Men is alive and well in one poster for Van Heusen ties, which shows a wife on her knees delivering breakfast with the bold claim: 'Show her it's a man's world'.

Some of the adverts are simply funny, like the Gillette razor so safe it's pictured being used by a baby.

But others would now be downright irresponsible: 'For a better start in life, start Cola earlier!'

Easily replaced: This VW ad said its parts were cheap, and it was cavalier in its attitude to women too. It boldly said: 'She can jab the hood or bump off the bumper... You can replace anything she uses to stop the car'

A man's world: Sexism was used to sell every luxury brand, from Van Heusen ties to Tipalet cigarettes

'Men are better than women!' This advert for sweaters said wives were 'a bit of a drag' on a mountain

The advert for Volkswagen boasts of the firm's hard-wearing cars, beginning simply: 'Women are soft and gentle, but they hit things'.

And one for Drummond sweaters proclaims: 'Indoors women are useful - even pleasant. On a mountain they are something of a drag'.

The vintage pieces look shockingly out of date now, but they will be far from the last adverts to be deemed sexist.

Last year an advert for Renault cars was banned in Britain for having a little too much 'va va voom' - in other words, multiple close-ups on the breasts and bottoms of burlesque dancers.

And a U.S. commercial for hair removal product Veet prompted outrage earlier this month by suggesting women were manly if they chose to keep their body hair.

Light up Mom! This advert claimed 'you need never feel over-smoked'. Perhaps they hadn't heard of cancer

Rotten: These adverts promoted sugary drinks for toddlers, asking: 'How soon is too soon? Not soon enough'

Nice and safe: The 'recent nationwide survey' this Camel advert was based on is probably a little out of date

And finally: Some of the ads, such as this one for a razor so safe it can be used by a baby, are downright funny

Women do not have the monopoly on being offended, however.

A Samsung TV advert last year infuriated some customers who claimed its depiction of lazy, hairy 'slobs' was unfair to the world's men.

The controversy was a lesson in there being no such thing as bad publicity, however - as despite being slammed as 'feminist porn' it got more than 10million hits on YouTube.
