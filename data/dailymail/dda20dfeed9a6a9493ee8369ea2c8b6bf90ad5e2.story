Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has reassured fans that the club do not plan to use artificial crowd noise to improve the matchday atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

In November, Jose Mourinho opened the debate on the Chelsea noise levels when he claimed that playing at home was 'like playing in an empty stadium'.

In the following months, there has been much debate within the supporters and at the club on ideas to improve the atmosphere, but Buck has categorically stated that recorded noise is not an option for the Premier League leaders.

Jose Mourinho said in November that playing at home was 'like playing in an empty stadium'

'Our manager, for some reason, decided a few months ago to say that the fans were quiet at moments,' Buck said to the crowd at an event in London hosted by the Wall Street Journal. 

'One of the problems is it's very difficult to get tickets when the stadium is sold out every week. It's difficult to get young people to visit because it's hard to buy tickets.

'Every club is looking to improve the matchday experience, but we can't have recorded fan noise — our fans just wouldn't accept that.

'We don't have cheerleaders; we have to do what's right for our home environment. You have to understand your market place.'

Despite the apparent lack of noise at home matches, it does not appear to have affected the team, who are top of the Premier League by five points. 

'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans. At this moment it's difficult for us to play at home, though, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium.

'The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home. It's difficult to get that strong start where the players, team and fans at Stamford Bridge (are all together).

'I was today looking around and it was empty, but not in terms of people because it was obviously full. That's what is frustrating.'
