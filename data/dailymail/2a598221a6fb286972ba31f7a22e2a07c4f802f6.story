Syrian government forces have dropped barrel bombs on rebel-held districts of Aleppo killing 13 people, including children, according to a monitoring group.

The latest slaughter came just hours after both sides congratulated themselves for 'positive' developments at peace talks in Geneva, following four days without a breakthrough.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the new government offensive saw barrel-bombings in the Maadi and Salhin districts of south Aleppo, and separate gun battles on the main road toward the city's Nairab airbase and near the famous Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers.

A woman and at least one child were killed in Maadi when helicopter forces loyal to Syria's President Assad dropped controversial barrel bombs on the residential neighbourhood.

The attacks are likely to have a negative effect on ongoing peace talks between the two sides, which only hours earlier were hailed as a 'positive step forward' by a negotiator for the rebels.

Louay Safi, a spokesman for the opposition's negotiating team, said the government delegation stuck to its demand that putting an end to terrorism remains its number one priority but added that it should be taken as a good sign that a change in government is now being openly discussed by both sides.

Even before today's barrel bomb attacks, the credibility of the supposed breakthrough was being called into question, as both sides continue to blame each other for not taking the talks further.

The peace talks will come to a close of Friday, with today's attacks seen by many as confirmation there will not be a significant breakthrough before the negotiators leave Geneva.

According to Safi, the government is now more willing to discuss the issue of Assad stepping down but he admitted it was still a subject they seem keen to push 'to the back of the discussion'.

Bouthaina Shaaban, an adviser to Syrian President Bashar Assad, confirmed that both sides touched on the issue, but described today's talks as constructive for another reason.

'The talks have been positive today actually because they spoke about terrorism,' she said.

A deal to allow humanitarian aid into the besieged central city of Homs remains on ice, with the Syrian delegation demanding assurances the aid will not go to 'armed and terrorist groups' in the city.

The talks were cut short yesterday over the U.S. decision to restart deliveries of nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition, more than a month after al-Qaida-linked militants seized warehouses and prompted a sudden cutoff of Western supplies to the rebels.

The officials said the communications equipment and other items are being funneled only to non-armed opposition groups, but the move boosts Syria's beleaguered rebels, who saw their international support slide, in large part because of the extremists among their ranks.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated that 1,200 women, children and elderly people are trapped in besieged areas of the old quarter of Homs.

Alongside the new government offensive, there was fresh fighting between ideologically opposed rebel factions in the town of Al Bab, where moderate fighters clashed with members of the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
