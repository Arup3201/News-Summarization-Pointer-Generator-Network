A police department wants to trade two vintage 1920s Tommy guns worth $30,000 each for modern rifles for its officers.

Forsyth County Sheriff's Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has had the machine guns since the 1930s when they were donated by a local tobacco company.

Reynolds Tobacco had used the weapons to protect their employees' cash on payday but then donated them when they changed payment methods.

The sheriff's office now wants to trade the firearms - which became famous during the prohibition era - with a gun store in return for AR-15 assault rifles for its officers.

Chief Deputy Brad Stanley told the Winston-Salem Journal it is a good deal because the old Tommy guns can't be used by its officers while new rifles would help the force reach its goal of giving every officer a long gun, a sidearm and a Taser.

County commissioners will vote on the trade next week.

While the vintage weapons are commonly known as 'Tommy' guns, they are actually called the Thompson submachine gun after its inventor John T Thompson in 1918.

Protection: The Tommy guns had been used by Reynolds Tobacco company to protect employees' cash on payday before they changed payment methods and donated the weapons to the police

The firearms were a common sight during the prohibition era when they were used by police officers and criminals alike.

The Thompson was also known informally as the 'Trench Broom', 'Trench Sweeper', 'Chicago Typewriter', 'Chicago Piano', 'Chicago Style', 'Chicago Organ Grinder', and 'The Chopper'.

During its time, the Thompson was favored by soldiers, criminals, police and civilians alike for its ergonomics, compactness, large .45 ACP cartridge, reliability, and high volume of automatic fire.

It has become a popular collectors item for because of its historical significance.
