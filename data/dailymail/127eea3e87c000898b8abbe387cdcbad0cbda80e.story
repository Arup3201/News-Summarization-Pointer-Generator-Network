Jailed: Zaher Somani (pictured), 58, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after admitting tax evasion and fraud

A disgraced former magistrate who lived a life of luxury on the proceeds of tax fraud and money laundering has been jailed for more than three years.

Zaher Somani, 58, built up a huge property portfolio, sent his children to private schools, was a regular at casinos and lived in a £300,000 house in an upmarket village.

But HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) discovered Somani, who also ran a taxi firm, was pocketing hundreds of thousands of pounds by lying to officials about his true income.

Between 2004 and 2011 Somani, who was serving as a Justice of the Peace at Loughborough Magistrates' Court at the time, fiddled self-assessment tax returns to pocket around £250,000.

He was jailed for three-and-a-half years yesterday at Nottingham Crown Court after admitting tax evasion and fraud at the same court in October.

Four co-conspirators, including his wife, appeared alongside him and were all given suspended prison sentences.

The court heard Somani, of Quorn, Leicstershire, committed the offences while he was the owner of two Loughborough taxi companies, A1 and Charnwood Taxis, which operated 30 private hire vehicles.

Family members helped hide his firms' earnings by using bank accounts and assets in Jersey, Canada, India, Turkey and Morocco, the court heard.

Somani's wife Ashraf, 43, brother Pyarali, 61, sister-in-law Shabina, 50, and officer manager Darren Green, 44, were also sentenced for their part in the conspiracy.

Judge James Sampson said: 'Zaher Somani lied to the bitter end and has been shamed and disgraced.

'The offending spanned many years while sitting as a magistrate, pretending to be a man of integrity and honesty. The hypocrisy could not have been greater.'

Stuart Taylor, assistant director of criminal investigation at HMRC, said: 'Zaher Somani was a serving magistrate at the time of these offences, a man supposed to uphold the law.

'Instead, he was stealing from the taxpayer.

'This man and his family lived well beyond their legitimate means, until HMRC uncovered their extensive tax evasion, associated money laundering and benefit fraud.

'Somani and his family failed to pay their full taxes, at the expense of honest taxpayers.'

Zaher's wife, Ashraf Somani, 44, of Quorn, was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work.

Along with her husband, she admitted tax evasion totalling £250,000 for self-assessment income tax fraud, unpaid VAT and tax credits fraud.

Zaher's brother, Pyarali Somani, 61, of Loughborough, worked as a taxi driver for both companies.

He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work.

He admitted self-assessment income tax fraud and tax credits fraud totalling £60,000.

Pyarali's wife, Shabina Somani, 51, of Loughborough, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

She was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work. She admitted tax credits fraud jointly with her husband totalling £16,049.

Taxi driver Darren Green, 43, of Leicester, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and given a nine-month supervision order.

He admitted income tax fraud and fraudulently claiming tax credits worth £11,229 and involvement in tax evasion totalling £250,000.
