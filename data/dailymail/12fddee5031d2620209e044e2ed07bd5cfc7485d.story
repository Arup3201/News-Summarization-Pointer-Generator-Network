Hillary Clinton is a politician of 'yesterday' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told a gathering of conservatives on Friday.

In a word-association game with Fox News host Sean Hannity, the Republican senator - considered likely to run for the White House in 2016 - offered a scathing assessment of the Democrat, who is expected to announce her own presidential campaign later this year.

Hannity asked Rubio about former president Bill Clinton to which Rubio first replied, 'What's the next one?' before saying the 42nd president of the United States is 'really yesterday'.

Asked about the current Commander in Chief, Barack Obama, Rubio simply said: 'failed.'

Rubio was the first in a line of likely Republican presidential candidates to address attendees of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning, now in its second day of speakers. 

Florida Senator Marco Rubio told a gathering of conservatives on Friday that Hillary Clinton is a politician of 'yesterday.' The freshman lawmaker said he is still undecided about his political plans while acknowledging that he wants to 'pay back in some way' the country for the opportunities it has provided his family

'I don't want to be in politics my whole life,' Rubio told Fox News Host Sean Hannity during a question and answer session during his appearance. He noted that he'd perhaps like to own an NFL team at some point. 'I don't know, I'd have to sell a lot of books for that,' the two time author joked

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina,  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson all spoke to the confab on Thursday.

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush were set to take the main stage on Friday. 

A notable exception to lineup was former Arkansas Gov. and Fox News host Mike Huckabee, who has said he is considering a bid in 2016 yet didn't participate in the Washington, D.C. area powwow that attracts roughly 10,000 conservatives from across the country each year.'

Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said Friday he is still undecided about his own political plans while acknowledging that he wants to 'pay back in some way' the country for the opportunities it has provided his family.

'I don't want my kids to come up and one day ask me, "how come you got to grow up in the greatest country in the world, but we get to grow up in a country's that's been diminished?" ' Rubio said.

The freshman senator said would 'have to decide through careful prayer' if running for president is the best decision at this stage in his life. 

Rubio reaffirmed that if he does make a play for the presidency, he won't seek reelection to his Senate seat even though Florida law allows him to do both simultaneously.

'I think if you want to want to be president, you decide that's what you've been called at this time in your life to at least run for, you believe that''s the best way for your to serve America, that's what you run for,' he told Hannity. 

'The truth is Sean, I don't want to be in politics my whole life,' he added, noting that he'd perhaps like to own an NFL team at some point. 

'I don't know, I'd have to sell a lot of books for that,' the two time author joked.

Results of the conference's straw poll for the presidential race weren't to be revealed until Saturday evening, but based on the number the conference goers who showed up to see Rubio speak and stayed until the end of his 20 minute session, he's likely to take a top placement. 

After Perry, who drew a noticeably smaller crowd that Rubio in the first place, finished his prepared remarks, guests flooded out of the room before the interview portion of his appearance began.
