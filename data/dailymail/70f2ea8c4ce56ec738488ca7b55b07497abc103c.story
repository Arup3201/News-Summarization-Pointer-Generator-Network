Liverpool legends Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler were in a jovial mood on Tuesday as they enjoyed a question and answer session with Liverpool fans in Boston, Massachusetts.

The lighthearted session saw former Reds striker Fowler poke fun at Ian Rush's infamous moustache much to the delight of the adoring crowd. 

The Liverpool ambassadors have been promoting last season's Premier League runners-up as they prepare for the new campaign with a trip stateside.
