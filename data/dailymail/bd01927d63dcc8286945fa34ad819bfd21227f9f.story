There may not be a sphinx on every street corner in London or Manchester, but Egypt has had a bigger influence on British architecture than you would think.

From cinemas to supermarkets, factories to mausoleums, a new book has revealed the deep-seated influence the ancient territory has had on British building design for more than 200 years.

The Egyptian influence on British architecture can been seen all over the UK, including Blickling Hall stately home in the village of Blickling in Norfolk, which houses a wonderful Egyptian mausoleum

Two faux-Egyptian sphinxes cast from bronze sit either side of Cleopatra's Needle in London, and make up the most famous example of Egyptian architecture in Britain. It is situated on the Victoria Embankment on The Thames

'Egypt in England' by Chris Elliott examines over 50 Egyptian sites in Britain, revealing the curious stories behind these unusual and often outlandish pieces of architecture and interior design.

Chris Elliot's book 'Egypt in England' looks at the influence Egypt has had on British architectural design in the last few centuries

For centuries the wonder of Ancient 
Egypt remained largely inaccessible to European travellers, until its 
'rediscovery' in the 19th century.

During England's Regency era (1811-1820) Egyptian style became the very height of fashion.

This 'Egyptomania' was fuelled by the
British discovery, exactly 90 years ago this November, of Tutankhamun's
tomb, which gave the world some of its most iconic images of the 
ancient civilisation.  

When
its jewels and treasures travelled to London, the event provided a 
global cultural blockbuster and created an enduring fascination with all
things Egyptian.   

Today,
this legacy can be seen in a wide range of English architecture and 
interiors, from the famous Cleopatra's Needle in London to the lesser 
known pyramid in Bickling Park, Norwich.

Published by English Heritage to coincide with the discovery of 
Tutankhamen's Tomb, 'Egypt in England' provides a look at these and 
other forgotten paragons of Egyptian-style that span our nation.

An accompanying exhibition is at London's Wellington Arch until January 13 next year. Click on Egypt in England for details.
