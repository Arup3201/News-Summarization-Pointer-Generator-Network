As a record-breaking NFL player, Aaron Rodgers has seen more than a few hairy moments.

But there's one he particularly enjoys - and for some Green Bay Packers fans, it's behind the team's run of victories.

The 31-year-old quarterback sparked frenzied debate when cameras caught him casually stroking a nine-inch ginger beard on Sunday. 

Lucky fuzz: Jeremy's Wilcox, the owner of the nine-inch ginger beard which has become Aaron Rodgers' lucky charm, says it's all a bit of fun. 'People come up to me all the time and ask if they can touch it', he added

In action: This is the moment during Sunday's Packers game which prompted a deluge of speculation

Now it's emerged he and the bristles' owner have had their good luck ritual for most of the season, and it happens at almost every home game.

To the more superstitious - or the fantasists, depending on your point of view - Jeremy's Wilcox's chin is to thank for Packers' unbeaten run of home wins.

But Mr Wilcox said from his log cabin in the town of Maine: 'It's just guys having fun'.

The 39-year-old is a communications technician whose job it is to provide help from the sidelines at the Packers' home games in Wisconsin.

He remained relatively unknown until the cheerful online storm which followed the Packers' game on Sunday against the Detroit Lions on national TV.

Meme-worthy: Reaction on Twitter was bemused and light-hearted, and it wasn't long before a Vine appeared

It prompted a deluge of interview requests and he was soon outed as the beard's owner, including on the front page of the Wasau Daily Herald.  

He told the newspaper he began growing the beard two years ago, and $18million-a-year star Rodgers simply caught his eye one day and gave it a tug.

'It's never at the same time or same place', he said. 'It's just lighthearted. It's a lot of fun - just guys having fun.

'I don't do anything with it. I let it run wild. People come up to me all the time and ask me if they can touch it.' 

The Packers have won all eight of their home games this season, and as their best-paid and most famous player Rodgers can take more than a small share of the credit.

Dip in fortune: The Green Bay quarterback did get stamped on, but came back from the dressing room to win

The quarterback signed a five-year contract worth up to $130million last year, including a salary cap of $17.9million in 2014 which rises in each year until the end of the deal.

His lucky charm has not been completely successful, of course.

He was carted off to the locker room with an injured ankle on Sunday after Detroit Lions star defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh stomped on it - a move which earned him a suspension.

But he returned in the second half - and duly led the Packers to a 30-20 victory.
