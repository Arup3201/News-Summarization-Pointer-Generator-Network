A headmistress of a private school has been shot dead by a former teacher who returned to the campus with an AK-47 concealed in a guitar case.

Dale Regan, 63, was shot dead by Spanish teacher Shane Schumerth, 28, after he stormed into her office on Tuesday morning. Schumerth, who had been fired hours before, then committed suicide.

No students were injured in the murder suicide at the Episcopal School in Jacksonville, Florida.

Killed: Dale Regan, the headmistress of a Florida school, was shot dead by a teacher who had been fired

Gunman: Police say Shane Schumerth walked onto campus with an assault rifle hidden in a guitar case and shot Dale Regan to death before taking his own life

Officers responded to the school at 1.23 p.m on Tuesday after reports of a person with a gun. The school was placed on lockdown. When officers arrived, the headmistress and the gunman were found dead.

'The situation is under control,' the 
Sheriff's Office said, according to the Florida Times Union. 'At this 
time there is no outstanding suspects.'

One eighth grade student, Lilly Sheppard, told the paper she was close to the shooting when it happened but did not hear the shots.

When she left her classroom, a member of
staff told her to stay inside. Students were evacuated shortly after 
but were not told why, she said.

Concerns: Staff and officers gather outside the school. The gunman killed himself after shooting Regan dead

Fears: Parent Shoran Williams, center, asks about getting into the school to collect her daughter after the fatal shooting at Episcopal High School. No students were injured

The 13-year-old added that Schumerth had been a substitute in her French class before. He also taught history and Spanish.

'He was shy and he sat by himself a lot at lunch,' Sheppard told the Times Union. 'He didn't really seem to fit in with the other teachers.'

Loss: Regan had worked at the school more more than 30 years, first as an English teacher

He failed to turn up for his home room class on Tuesday morning and Sheppard said there were rumours he had been fired.

'No one seemed that surprised,' she added.

Schumerth had also coached at Duval County public schoolâ€™s debate team in 2010 before resigning from the school system.

He began working at Episcopal in August 2010, according to the Times Union.

Brandon Steele, a seventh grade student, added: 'It was really really terrifying. A lot of people were crying.'

Undersheriff Dwain Senterfitt with the
Jackonsville Sheriff's Office expressed his grief at the tragedy.

'Our prayers go out to the Episcopal community,' he said. 'It's a tough day for us.'

The Rev. Kate Moorehead, the Diocese of Florida, called Regan a beloved and dedicated educator whose loss stunned everyone who knew her.

'We ask you to please pray for us as a 
community,' Moorehead said. 'We have full confidence that Dale Regan is 
already with God and in heaven with our lord and savior Jesus.'

Regan had worked at the school for 
more than 30 years, starting as a teacher before moving to 
administration and the head of school.

She was the first female to hold the position, which she called an 'exciting adventure' in 2010.

But she said she hoped to return to teaching, adding: 'I miss the classroom very much.'

Regan
was honoured in 2011 by The Florida Times Union for her 
accomplishments, particularly opening two new classrooms which used new 
technology.

In a statement, the 900-student school released said the community was 'deeply saddened'.

'Our deepest sympathies are with her family and we ask for your support and prayers during this time,' it wrote. 'The entire School family mourns the loss of our friend and leader.'

The school will close until the end of its spring break later this month. The statement added that it would provide counseling for all students, faculty and staff.

Vigils for Regan will be held tonight at
St. Johns Cathedral, St. Mark's Episcopal Church and 
San Jose Episcopal Church.
