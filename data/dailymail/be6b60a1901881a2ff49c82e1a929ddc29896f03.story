It’s a feeling dog owners know all too well – the guilt brought on by leaving Fido at home while working long hours.

But owners can now keep in touch with their dog by logging on remotely to what is being described by its makers as the world’s first video phone for pets.

U.S. company PetChatz says it allows an owner to rid themselves of the guilt of leaving their pet at home alone.

The system features a colour camera that allows the owner to check on their pet.

And with animals said to be able to follow images much better on modern screens, it can see their owner’s familiar face once they are taught to respond to a calling tone.

It can also record clips over a wi-fi network.

Both cats and dogs can see in colour, although neither animal’s eyesight is as good as a human’s.A
 special tone tells pets their owner is calling so they can be trained 
to run to the video phone.

The unit, which attaches to the wall at a 
level comfortable for the pet, also dishes out treats and diffuses 
soothing scents.

The Minnesota-based company says it is a ‘joyful sensory experience.’

The new gadget retails at £210 and is only available in the US and Canada.
