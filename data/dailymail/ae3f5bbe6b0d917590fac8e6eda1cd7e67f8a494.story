The wife of a heroic New York City police officer who narrowly escaped death when he was stabbed in the skull last year became one of the 1,247 new recruits who were welcomed into the Police Academy this week.

Standing in a packed Queens auditorium Wednesday, 27-year-old Dina Loor raised her right hand and repeated the words of the oath administered by Commissioner Raymond Kelly, officially making her a probationary police officer.  

The wife and mother-of-two knows better than most people the inherent dangers associated with a career in law enforcement.

Creme of the crop: Loor was among the 1,247 men and women who were sworn in by Kelly (behind lectern), becoming probationary officers

On April 17, 2012, her husband, officer Eder Loor, was stabbed through the skull while responding to a call placed by the mother of an emotionally disturbed man in East Harlem.

Terrence Hale, 26, plunged the three-and-a-half inch blade deep into officer Loor's left temple. The cop pulled the knife, which had enter just above his eye, out of his head, apparently unaware he had been critically injured.

Against all odds, Loor has survived, earning him the nickname ‘the luckiest unlucky man ever’ from his doctor. 

Mr Loor was truly fortunate: the blade
passed half an inch below an area of the brain that controls motor 
functions, and another half-inch from a collection of nerves which 
control vision.

Deadly weapon: Hall allegedly plunged this 3-and-a-half-inch knife deep into Loor's temple, narrowly missing an area of the brain that controls motor functions and nerves that control vision

On his side: Dina Loor stood by her husband during his slow recovery process

Loor's 
alleged assailant, who suffers from schizophrenia and a bi-polar 
ordered, has been charged with attempted aggravated murder, assault and 
criminal possession of a weapon, according to CBS New York.

This past March, the courageous cop was promoted to detective, but his injuries have left him unable to continue his service.

Her husband's extremely close call, followed by a slow recovery, has not deterred Mrs Loor from pursuing her dream of joining the force. If anything, the ordeal has steeled her resolve to join the force. 

‘After my education at John Jay College, I would say that I wanted to pursue this career more than I’ve ever anticipated,’ she told the New York Post. ‘I have passion for the law and to enforce it and to protect the community as well.’

The new recruit said that her husband stands behind her decision.

‘He’s always telling me to follow my heart and this is where my heart has been,’ she said.

Happy family: The Loors have two young kids, a 6-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy

Mrs Loor added that her spouse has offered her some words of advice as she embarks on her risky career path, namely to always be alert and ready, and to trust her partner.

The aspiring cop said that her 6-year-old daughter was excited to learn that she is going to be a police officer. The Loors also have a 2-year-old son. 

Mrs Loor said she is grateful to the NYPD for the support the agency has shown her. The recruit is one of 225 women joining the Police Academy.

On Friday, the 27-year-old and her fellow probationary officers will report to the New York City Police Academy in Manhattan to begin their training.
