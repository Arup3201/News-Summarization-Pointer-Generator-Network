A man who woke up during the middle of cataract eye surgery has claimed he was the victim of 'torture' after tape was put over his mouth to stop him complaining.

Hector Alonso, 69, claims he was forcibly held down and gagged by medical staff after he demanded the surgery be halted.

In legal papers filed against his surgeon he claims tape was placed over his mouth and as a result he swallowed one of his teeth.

Alonso said his treatment was 'torture' and claims the operation was botched leaving him blind in his right eye.

He has sued eye surgeon Shehab A. Ebrhim and Tulane University Medical Centre in Mississippi where the operation was carried out.

Alonso claims he was admitted to Tulane University Medical Center for a cataract surgery in his right eye but mid-way through the intensive surgery his anesthetic wore off.

He said he could see Ebrahim operating on his eye with medical instruments.

According to the suit, Alonso begged the surgeon to stop the surgery but he claims the medical personnel put a piece of tape over his mouth and continued the operation with him wide awake.

While being 'gagged' and allegedly held down by hospital staff he claims he swallowed one of his teeth, describing his treatment as 'torture.'

Alonso is seeking an unspecified amount in damages saying he was the victim of assault and battery as well as medical negligence.

He says the defendant failed to properly treat him, failed to take into account the safety of others, didn't use proper procedures, failed to properly supervise employees and failed to properly sedate and monitor him during the operation.

Alonso claims the horrific ordeal caused him immeasurable physical pain due as well as mental anguish, annoyance, disability, discomfort and medical expenses.

He claims the apparent loss of sight in his right eye caused by the 'botched' surgery has also stopped him from engaging in certain recreational activities and has destroyed his earning capacity.

Dr Ebrahim is certified by The American Board of Ophthalmology and is a member of the American Society of Retinal Specialists.

The case is being heard in the Judicial District Court in Gretna, Mississippi, before judge John J. Molaison Jr.
