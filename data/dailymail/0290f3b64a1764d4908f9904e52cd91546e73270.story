It is, say Royal insiders, the Duchess of Cambridge's 'secret weapon' for staying in shape. So it's no surprise that smoothie-maker the NutriBullet has become a must-have device.

The gadget, which pulverises fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds, is known as an 'extractor' rather than a juicer or blender, due to its unique high-powered blade action. It's this, manufacturers say, which is the key to retaining the nutritional content in your smoothie.

Today, The Mail on Sunday is offering readers the chance to buy one, along with a recipe book detailing how you can use it, and other bonus items as part of an incredible half-price deal. So what IS the NutriBullet – and can it justify the hype?

First, a word on digestion

Chewing is the first step in the digestive process, where food is broken down into smaller pieces. But, as adults, many of us do it a lot less, meaning that we absorb fewer vitamins and minerals.

This, coupled with the fact that digestive enzymes deplete as we grow older, means that by middle age, we're often not getting the best from our diets, even if we're trying to eat well. This is where the NutriBullet comes in.

Why 'extracting' is the key

Despite its small size, the NutriBullet's 600w motor and extractor blades are enough to turn even heartier vegetables, fruit and ice into smooth drinks in a process called 'nutrition extraction'. When you consume this nutrition-extracted food, according to the gadget's makers, you spare the digestive system the work of breaking down dense and fibrous foods, allowing it to focus on absorbing the maximum amount of nutrients locked inside.

Slimmer, happier, healthier

At the core of the NutriBullet plan is the Nutriblast – a smoothie comprising 50 per cent greens and 50 per cent fruit, plus two to four tablespoons of 'boosts' (nuts, seeds or other super-charged foods). To make a Nutriblast, you always follow this method, but tailor the ingredients depending on the results you want – whether it's better sleep, cardiovascular health, or stronger muscles. It couldn't be simpler – just swap breakfast or lunch for a filling smoothie.

Over the following pages, we've provided inspiring recipes to help you get started, but you can always create your own blend. Just remember: half greens, half fruit and veg, and those 'boosts'.

Now, turn over, choose your recipes… and introduce a daily Nutriblast to your balanced diet.

Contrary to recent reports, drinking juices and smoothies will not make you fat.

But if you are expecting to add one of these tasty blends to a diet of chips, chocolate biscuits and lashings of wine, and still reap some kind of miraculous health benefit, you’ll be disappointed.

Most doctors will tell you there is no such thing as unhealthy food – it’s an unhealthy diet that is a problem. The good news is that this means you can indulge in the odd burger or slice of cake.

But if you eat these all the time, at best you’ll be consuming unhealthy foods at the expense of far better choices. At worst, you’ll be overweight and on your way to a heart attack.

A despairing dietician once told me that she has unwell, obese patients who ignore all her advice, yet gamely inform her that they are drinking ‘a whole carton of orange juice every day now’, alongside their usual four cans of cola.

Sadly, one doesn’t magically counteract the other.

Juices and smoothies are concentrated and so make gulping down large quantities of fruit sugars in one sitting easy. In some cases, they contain more sugar than a can of cola. 

A litre a day is too much, but a small glass of orange juice as part of a healthy, balanced diet (where cake and coke is a rare treat rather than a regular item) will provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in a convenient way. The NUTRiBULLET recipes here contain vegetables (naturally lower in sugar), as well as fruit and seeds, and nuts or cereals to increase the satiating fibre content – making them a really good choice. One a day will do you heaps of nutritional favours as long as it’s not used to wash down a fast-food takeaway.

The boring truth is that there is no quick fix when it comes to diet, and a smoothie-maker won’t change your life.

But if you have resolved this year to eat a better, more balanced diet, then getting one of these is certainly a brilliant place to start.

1. Bananas are a great way to boost your fibre intake, which can help prevent heart disease and diabetes and improve digestive health.

A medium-sized banana contains 3g of fibre, a sixth of the recommended daily intake.

2. If you’re craving carbs, opt for sweet potatoes. They are a good source of fibre, help stabilise blood sugar, and contain nearly three times your daily Vitamin A allowance, which is essential for healthy vision.

3. Blueberries are loaded with Vitamins K and C and fibre.

A study of 93,000 women found those who ate at least three portions a week reduced their heart-attack risk by a third.

4. Raw cacao powder has nearly four times the antioxidant content of dark chocolate. Antioxidants help to combat free radicals.

5. Often avoided by dieters, avocados are high in fibre to keep you fuller for longer, and contain beneficial fats to lower cholesterol.

6. Just one papaya contains twice the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. An enzyme called papain can be extracted from the papaya and applied to skin to treat infected wounds.

7. Oats contain soluble fibre called oat beta-glucan, which helps prevent cholesterol in food being absorbed into our bodies.

8. Adding almonds to your diet could lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. A US study found people who consumed a fifth of their daily calories by eating almonds had lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol.

9. Leafy green kale contains folate, a B vitamin central to brain development. It can also be beneficial for heart health.

10. Ginger soothes the digestive system and also encourages perspiration, so it can help reduce fevers by cooling the body.
