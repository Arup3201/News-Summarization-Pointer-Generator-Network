Andrew Flintoff trained on the outfield with Lancashire before day two of their LV= County Championship match against Somerset after his return to cricket over the weekend.

The 36-year-old former England captain seemed to be feeling the effects of his exertions at St Annes, tweeting on Monday: 'Still a bit stiff from Saturdays 12 overs just bowled 5 more now for a rub !'

However, Flintoff showed flashes of his old genius during his comeback for St Annes, taking a superb caught-and-bowled among his three wickets.

And if he pulls one of those beauties out during the NatWest T20 Blast, it will justify Lancashire's pay incentive.

Flintoff is set to cash in on his return to top-level cricket by taking a portion of the gate receipts for Lancashire’s Twenty20 home matches.

It is understood the all-rounder, who is hopeful of ending his five-year absence from the game on Friday as Lancashire host Roses rivals Yorkshire at Old Trafford, will receive £1 for every spectator who turns up over and above a pre-agreed figure —  possibly 8,000.

The county’s two home matches so far in the Natwest T20 Blast have pulled in crowds of 5,300 against Worcestershire and 5,900 against Warwickshire.

Last year’s home fixture against Yorkshire drew a crowd of over 12,000 — more than double the figure they achieved for any  of their four other Twenty20 games in Manchester. 

Since Jos Buttler, fresh from his heroic 121 off 74 balls in England’s defeat by Sri Lanka at Lord’s on Saturday, may also be available for selection for Lancashire, the opportunity will be there for Flintoff to add a few  thousand pounds to a deal that already includes appearance fees and win bonuses. 

Flintoff is dreaming of a return against bitter rivals Yorkshire, but insists he only wants to play if he proves this week he is good enough for ‘cricket reasons’.

Freddie, 36, came through a low-key playing comeback on Saturday by helping St Annes beat Penrith in a lowly Northern Premier League game.

He knows if he gets selected for Lancashire on the big stage now, somebody else will have to miss out and he does not want to get a game for sympathy reasons.

‘I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t think about playing against Yorkshire,’ said Flintoff. ‘It will be a full house, however, Friday is a long way away, it really is — if I get a  go, I get a go but I’m not by any means expecting to play.

‘On Thursday I’ve got a game with the Lancashire second team, which I’m just going to go out there and enjoy. I’m not going to put any undue pressure on myself  thinking that this is a trial for Friday or anything like that. I’m just going to play — and if I get picked, I get picked.

‘If I’m 
going to play then someone else is going to miss out. They’ve got to be 
comfortable that, when they tell the player who is missing out, it’s the
 right decision for cricket reasons. And I need to be comfortable with 
that as well. 

‘So
 it’s all down to cricket, down to what value I can give the side and 
whether I can give more than the  person I take over from.’ 

After
 Saturday’s cameo, which include facing three balls as a batsman before 
being caught on the  boundary attempting a six, he stressed how the 
competition for Lancashire is especially tough now.

‘I’m not putting too much  pressure on myself,’ added Flintoff. ‘I’m not making big hopes.

‘I’m just going to see where it goes. I appreciate that Lancashire are on a roll in Twenty20s and there’s Jos Buttler and Jimmy Anderson and people to come back into that side. 

‘So it’s not a gimme that I’m going to play. But I’m going to try to put myself in the frame. The comeback has just crept up on me. It’s not something that was a goal of mine, that I set out to do. 

‘It has just come around quite  innocently and that’s been the nice thing about it. I’m not chasing anything. I’m just  enjoying it. Why shouldn’t I? I like cricket.’

With Freddie Flintoff offered a portion of the Old Trafford gate for his return to top-level cricket, Sportsmail takes a look at other stipulations which sports stars have requested...

Kevin Keegan

Keegan shocked football by moving from Southampton to Newcastle in 1982, dropping down a division. Club sponsors Newcastle Breweries had to help pay his £5,000-a-week wages. 

Bernd Stange 

The German manager agreed to become the coach of Iraq in 2002, but only with the proviso that if war broke out in the country he could leave.

Giuseppe Reina 

When the striker joined Arminia Bielefeld in 1996 he demanded the German football club build him a house for every year of his contract. He was there for three years.

Rolf-Christel Guie-Mien 

The Congolese footballer insisted Eintracht Frankfurt put in his contract that they would arrange cooking lessons for his wife, when he signed for them in 1999.

Didier Drogba 

When the former Chelsea striker made the surprise move to Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua he had it written into his contract that should Barcelona express interest he would be free to leave.

Georg Koch 

In 1997 the German goalkeeper moved to PSV Eindhoven, but only lasted three months. He had inserted a clause in contract saying he could leave the club if he suffered racist abuse.
