A shocking video has emerged showing a young boy being forced to run alongside his father’s car while the man shouts obscenities at his son.

The man – who in the video identifies himself as Brian Yates from Texas – can also be heard telling his son, who can’t be more than five years old, that he is putting him through his paces for football training.

‘This is how we train for football,’ he says. ‘Daddy drives and you run. Now get your little a** in shape!’

A shocking video has emerged showing a young boy being forced to run alongside his father's car while the man shouts obscenities at his son

With the vehicle moving at eight miles an hour, the father records his son running and shouts at him to increase his speed.

‘Come on. Faster Yates. You’re running like old Brian Yates. He ain’t worth a s***, an old slow son of a b****. Pick it up!’

At one point the young boy protests that he is ‘going as fast as I can' but his father is deaf to his protests.

‘I don’t want to hear your excuses,’ he yells before asking his son if he wants to play for the Texans or the Cowboys.

As the boy start running down the driveway to his home, his father increases the speed and demands that the young boy start running faster

The young boy, who can't be more than five years old, stops at one point and complains that his hip hurts

‘If you wanna play for the Cowboys pick that s*** up!’

As they approach the family’s driveway the boy comes to stop and complains that his hip hurts and he clutches his chest.

It probably doesn’t help the poor boy that he is having to run in a pair of Crocks.

Yet his father - clearly an exponent of tough love - tells him that he doesn’t want to hear any excuses in the video was uploaded onto the Worldstarhiphop.com website.

As they turn into the driveway to their home, the father’s vehicle is driving dangerously close behind the boy and he even increases his speed to 10 MPH.

Fortunately the young boy 'finds another gear' and sprints away from the vehicle and towards the house, no doubt relieved that his ordeal is over.

The father points his camera at the speedometer at one point which shows the vehicle is doing 8MPH before he increases it to 10MPH
