Tempers flared following the conclusion of the Toyota Owners 400 on Saturday, resulting in fisticuffs between drivers Marcos Ambrose and Casey Mears.

After driver Joey Logano made some clutch moves in the final laps to take the top spot at the Richmond International Raceway, in Richmond, Virginia, Ambrose and Mears began a heated exchange of words in a garage area of the raceway.

Ambrose and Mears, who placed 18th and 19th in the race, began shoving each other as tensions mounted. That's when Ambrose struck Mears with a right hook to the face, knocking the cap off of his head. The men then proceeded to engage each other before the fight was quickly broken up by witnesses.

While there was no official reason given for the altercation between the drivers, a tweet by Sporting News speculated that the fight was born from contact between both drivers near the end of the race.

According to Robin Pemberton, Vice President of Competition for NASCAR, upon initial review the altercation did not look like it was 'anything too severe.'

Pemberton told reporters that the footage of the fight will be fully reviewed on Monday or Tuesday, but that it did not seem like much happened. However, he left the possibility open that a full review could reveal more.

'Weâ€™ll get all the footage we can and look at it and see what happens from there.' said Pemberton. 'There might be more to it than that (a punch) so we have to take our time and look at everything.'

Ambrose did not have any comment following the incident. Mears did reference the incident on Twitter, but kept his message short, saying ' Had a good car tonight. Proud of the @GEICORacing team. Interesting end to the night. #13'

Post-race controversy in Richmond was not limited to the Ambrose-Mears fight. In addition, Logano's victory was contested by other racers behind him,  with allegations by driver Brad Keselowski, a member of Logano's team, that dirver Matt Kenseth intentionally ran him off of the road, to prevent him from winning. 

'I had a shot at winning the race and felt like he ran me off the track,' said Keselowski of Kenseth. Kenseth denied any sabotage on his part.

These allegations echoed the Clint Bowyer controversy of last year, when it was discovered after the Richmond race that he intentionally spun out his vehicle to prevent another driver from winning, as well as his own teammate from being competitive for a playoff spot.

While full blown punches have not been common between at-odds NASCAR 
drivers, the sport has had a recent history of drivers taking out their
 frustrations on each other. In 2013, Logano was involved in a tussle with driver Tony Stewart at the end of the Auto Club 400, in Fontana, California.

In another 2013 fight, driver Nelson Piquet, Jr. kicked Brian Scott in the groin. This fight also occurred at the Richmond International Raceway.

After the conclusion of the Toyota Owners 400, Ambrose, who drives for Richard Petty Motorsports, is ranked 16th in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Standings. Mears, who is with Germain Racing, is ranked 23rd.
