Craig Swainson avoided a prison sentence for a late night street attack that left victim Sean Moss blind in one eye, after his co-accused was dealt with at youth court and was given a rehabilitation order

Two drunken yobs have escaped jail after an apparent blunder by the courts despite having left their victim blinded in one eye.

Craig Swainson clenched his fists with delight and grinned when he was spared prison for the late-night street attack.

A judge said he was being forced to pass a lenient sentence because the other yob was wrongly dealt with by a youth court.

Victim Sean Moss suffered horrific facial fractures when he was knocked to the ground and kicked in the centre of Darlington, County Durham.

The father-of-two, a self-employed tiler, told in a victim impact statement how the drunken attack has ruined his life.

Mr Moss has regained some sight in his left eye but may never be able to see properly again, Teesside Crown Court heard.

The court was told that he has been registered disabled and unable to continue working since the brutal attack in August.

Swainson was caught on town centre closed circuit television cameras - along with another yob - leaving Mr Moss unconscious.

The other attacker - who cannot be named - was earlier dealt with by the youth court and was given a rehabilitation order.

A crown court judge, a senior prosecutor and an experienced probation officer all questioned the validity of the sentence.

Although he was aged 17 at the time of the assault, he was 18 when he was dealt with and should have been sent to the crown court.

His punishment is the kind that is reserved for under-18s only - but it had to be used as a bench-mark for Swainson.

He was given a nine-month suspended prison term after Recorder Bernard Gateshill, QC, said: 'I have to take into consideration they way in which he was dealt with.

'It seems to me that it would be harsh, indeed, if you were sent immediately to prison when your co-accused appears to have been dealt with in a very lenient way.

'It would have been far better if he had been committed to this court for sentence so you could have both been dealt with together, and I see no reason why that could not have been done, bearing in mind he was 18.'

Passing sentence at Teesside Crown Court, Recorder Bernard Gateshill, QC, said it would be 'harsh' if Swainson was jailed immediately when his co-accused 'appears to have been deal with in a very lenient way'

Swainson, 21, from Darlington, and the teenager, both pleaded guilty to a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Video camera footage showed the younger attacker wrestle Mr Moss to the ground when the victim approached their group pointing his finger.

David Lamb, mitigating, said the apprentice scaffolder had expressed 'real and genuine remorse' for his involvement in the attack.

He said there had been an earlier argument in a kebab shop when Swainson was punched, and added: 'There does appear to be a degree of provocation.'

In an impact statement, Mr Moss said: 'Whoever assaulted me has totally changed my life.

'I am registered disabled and I'm upset, distressed and angry. I am in constant fear about being alone and won't go out into the front street. I cannot take the children to the local park without another adult.'

Euro MP Martin Callanan said: 'Cases like this bring the whole justice system into disrepute.

'I would hope that the Attorney General will look urgently at the dreadful inadequacy of these sentences and consider intervening.

'The victim has been completely let down.'

A CPS spokesman said: 'The case of a youth defendant facing these charges could only be sent to the Crown Court if the adult co-defendant was to be tried there.

'It is not possible for youth defendants to be tried alone at Crown Court on these particular charges and as Craig Swainston, the adult defendant, pleaded guilty and did not face a Crown Court trial, there was no option but to send the youth defendantâ€™s case to the Youth Court.'
