David Villa ended his international career with a brilliant backheel but couldn't hide his emotions when substituted during Spain's win against Australia.

The 32-year-old announced his retirement from playing for his country prior to the World Cup and is set to link-up with New York FC when the defending world champions fly back from Brazil.

And the raw feeling was plain for all to see when Villa was hooked by Vicente Del Bosque in the second half of the 3-0 win.

Team-mates rushed to console the striker as he exited in the 57th minute.

And while he seemed to be holding it together as he trudged off, Villa appeared to burst into tears when he sat down on the bench.

Diego Costa had his arm around the former Atletico Madrid and Barcelona frontman while he was comforted by a coach.

Pedro, Iker Casillas and Gerard Pique were up in appreciation as he came off.

Del Bosque later revealed he was unaware it was Villa's last international.

'He (Villa) certainly seemed very annoyed. He said it was his last game, but I didn't know that. I'm sure he was upset,' the Spain boss told his post-match press conference.

'All I was thinking about is that it was time to kill off the game and we did that.'

The win against the Socceroos brought an end to what has been a dismal tournament for Del Bosque's side, who lost their opening two games and are surprisingly on their way home early.
