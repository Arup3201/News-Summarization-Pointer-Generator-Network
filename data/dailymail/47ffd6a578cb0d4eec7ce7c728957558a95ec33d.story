Three-year-old Aden got the ride of his life when his dog decided to take HIM for a walk.

Aden's Belgian Malinois, called Eteo, walked on his hind legs, while pushing his pint-sized companion's toy car along the boardwalk.

Onlookers in the seaside town of Newburyport, MA, couldn't help but stop and snap photos of the sweet moment between the two.

Eteo hopped onto his hind legs to push the yellow and red toy car along the boardwalk

Eteo is a personal protection dog trained by Protection Dogs Plus in New Hampshire.

While taught to take out bad guys, this playful pup makes a great family pet, as well.

And Eteo is clearly well-trained - he refused to be distracted from his important task, even when another mutt approached the impossibly cute duo. 

The dog was trained by Protect Dogs Plus - a pet training facility in New Hampshire

Eteo may have been trained to take out bad guys, but he also makes a perfect childhood companion

Onlookers in the duo's seaside Massachusetts town couldn't help but smile and take photos on their phones

Even when approached by another pup, Eteo did not get distracted from the task at hand
