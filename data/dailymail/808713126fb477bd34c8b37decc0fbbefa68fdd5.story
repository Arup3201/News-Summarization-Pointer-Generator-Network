It seems that whether you’re an X Factor fan or a Downton devotee is determined not by who you are – but by where you live.

Our viewing habits reveal strong regional allegiances, with those in the North-East tuning in to anything hosted by Geordie stars Ant and Dec and those in the North-West preferring Manchester export Coronation Street.

Research commissioned exclusively by the Daily Mail has revealed our favourite television programmes of the past year, broken down for the first time into different regions of the country.

While ITV reality show I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! was the UK’s most popular show of 2013 – drawing in an average of 12.4million viewers – it was not universally favoured.

Viewers in the north of the country and 
in Wales were gripped by the I’m A Celebrity showdown between 
contestants Amy Willerton and Olympian Rebecca Adlington.

The South East and East Anglia were the biggest fans of Strictly Come Dancing, won by Abbey Clancy (pictured)

But in the South it failed to register among the top five shows of the year.

Instead, viewers in the Home Counties preferred period dramas such as Downton Abbey and Call The Midwife.

In London, the top-rated show of  the year was the men’s Wimbledon tennis final, where Andy Murray ended the nation’s 77-year wait for a trophy by defeating Novak Djokovic.

But while the Scot’s match transfixed 2.4million Londoners – as well as another 1.3million viewers north of the Border –  it failed to make the top five anywhere else in the UK.

Instead, those in many regions preferred to watch home-grown dramas and presenters. In the North-East, any programme featuring presenting duo Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly was a hit.

The region’s top show of the year was Britain’s Got Talent, with I’m A Celebrity and Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway close behind – all fronted by the pair.  

Across the Pennines, however, viewers preferred Coronation Street. The ITV soap is based in Weatherfield, a fictional town located in Greater Manchester.

And the capital’s favourite soap, perhaps unsurprisingly, was BBC1’s EastEnders, set in London’s East End.

Some of the regional differences are harder to explain, though. ITV’s hit drama Downton Abbey has its most loyal fanbase in the South-West, where it beat Strictly and Children In Need to the top spot.

But in the South-East, the most popular drama was BBC1’s Call The Midwife, based in 1950s east London.

The figures were compiled for the Daily Mail by official ratings analysts Attentional.

Using a sample of 5,000 homes, the researchers were also able to put together the favourite shows of 2013 among Daily Mail readers.

Top of the list was Downton Abbey, with 
an average of 1.6million Daily Mail readers per episode. It narrowly 
beat Call The Midwife, which typically had 1.4million readers tuning in,
 with Strictly Come Dancing in third place.

Britain's Got Talent proved most popular in the North East, as did any programme hosted by Geordie duo Ant and Dec

A recent survey found one in four of us would rather watch television than take part in traditional hobbies such as visiting museums or playing sport.

A quarter of people now list their favourite pastime as watching  television, compared with just 5  per cent who say they enjoy playing a team sport.

Only 4 per cent said they spent their free time playing a musical instrument, while fishing was enjoyed by just 2 per cent.

Stamp and coin collecting, which had its heyday in the 1950s, is now only favoured by 2 per cent, while model making has a following of a mere  1 per cent.

Campaigners said the demise of these traditional hobbies was symptomatic of a society preoccupied with celebrity and reality TV.

The survey, by Santander, also showed only 8 per cent spent time visiting museums while 9 per cent said they enjoyed the arts.
