The Duchess of Cambridge revealed that she had splashed out on a trendy Bugaboo pram this week.

The brand is the ultimate status symbol for yummy London mummies despite being notoriously unwieldy and tricky to put up.

Kate, 31 and now six months’ pregnant, would have spent up to £1,200 on the Bugaboo stroller.

Unluckily for eager shopper Kate, an innovative new buggy hit the UK just yesterday, which claims to be simpler, lighter and cheaper than it's rival.

The featherweight Babyzen YOYO has a one of a kind folding mechanism which allows it to be opened and 
folded in seconds - but when fully open it performs like a city-friendly Bugaboo with its multi-directional wheels.

Parents can flip it open and fold it back up with just one hand - all while carrying their baby, and it has a handy detachable strap to can sling over a shoulder.

This innovative buggy has already become a phenomenon in much of Europe and has finally hit the UK.

Famous fans include Victoria's Secret model Doutzen Kroes, 28, who was spotted pushing her little son Phyllon Joy Gorré in a YOYO stroller as they made their way into Amsterdam airport just weeks ago.

Weighing just 5.8kg, the buggy folds down to 52cm x 44cm x 18cm.

YOYO, available to buy from whitestep.co.uk from £309,
 is the first buggy in the world to fully comply with size recommendation for cabin baggage, a handy feature for urban parents who drive smaller cars and take lots of flights.

'We can't rave enough about how brilliant the YoYo is,' said a Best Buggy spokesperson.

'We can flick the YOYO open in seconds with one movement, pop in our youngest, tighten up the harness (easily) and off we go and the YOYO feels fab to push and maneuver.'
