Tyson Fury has been fined £15,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control but has escaped a ban - clearing the way for his fight with Dereck Chisora to go ahead later this year. 

Fury landed himself in hot water in July when he launched a foul-mouth tirade at a press conference attended by women and children. 

But the Board decided not to ban the unbeaten 25-year-old on Wednesday, instead fining him £15k.

The decision means Fury's heavyweight clash with domestic rival Chisora can now go ahead as expected on  November 22 at London's ExCel arena. 

Promoter Frank Warren will hold a press conference on Monday, which Chisora and Fury will attend, to announce further details about the long-awaited fight. 

The pair had been due to meet in Manchester in July but Chisora withdrew from the fight after fracturing his hand.  

The rescheduled fight will be a WBO title eliminator and the European and vacant British titles will also be on the line.
