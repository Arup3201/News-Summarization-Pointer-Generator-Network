Devoted to one of the most innovative 
and influential artists of his generation, a new major photographic retrospective will include 
over 150 vintage photographs from Man Ray’s career, taken between 1916 and 
1968.

Man Ray Portraits, at London's National Portrait Gallery, is the first ever museum exhibition to focus on the photographic portraiture of the American modern artist. 

The works to be exhibited include studies of Pablo Picasso, Barbette, Catherine Deneuve, Ava Gardner, Lee Miller and Kiki de Montparnasse.

Drawn from private collections and major museums including the Pompidou Centre, the J. Paul Getty Museum and New York’s The Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum of Art, and special loans from the Man Ray Trust Archive, the majority of the works have not previously been exhibited in the UK.

Portraits of Man Ray’s celebrated contemporaries will be shown in the exhibition, alongside his personal and often intimate portraits of friends, lovers and his social circle.

His versatility and experimentation as 
an artist is illustrated throughout all of his photography, although this
was never his chosen principal artistic medium.

The exhibition brings together photographic portraits of cultural figures and friends including Marcel Duchamp, Berenice Abbott, Andre Breton, Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, James Joyce, Erik Satie, Henri Matisse, Barbette, Igor Stravinsky, Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dali, Le Corbusier, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, Coco Chanel and Wallis Simpson.

Also on show will be portraits of his 
lovers Kiki de Montparnasse (Alice Prin) and Lee Miller, who was also 
his assistant, Ady Fidelin and his last muse and wife Juliet Browner.

Philadelphia-born Man Ray, who was born in 1890 and died in 1976, 
spent his early life in New York, turning down a scholarship to study 
architecture in order to devote himself to painting.

He initially taught
himself photography in order to reproduce his works of art, but in 1920 
he began to work as a portrait photographer to fund his artwork. In 
1915, whilst at Ridgefield artist colony in New Jersey, he met the 
French artist Marcel Duchamp and together they tried to establish New 
York Dada.

His friendship 
with Duchamp led to Man Ray’s move to Paris in 1921, where, as a 
contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, he was perfectly 
placed to make defining images of his contemporaries from the 
avant-garde.

In this 
period he was instrumental in developing and producing a type of 
photogram which he called ‘Rayographs’, and is credited in inventing, 
alongside his lover and collaborator Lee Miller, the process of 
solarisation.

The use 
of solarisation can be seen in the portraits of Elsa Schiaparelli, Irene
Zurkinden, Lee Miller, Suzy Solidor and his own Self-Portrait with 
Camera included in the exhibition.

Following the outbreak of World War II, Man Ray left France for the US and took up residence in Hollywood.

Although
officially devoting himself once more to painting, new research has 
revealed that Man Ray made a number of significant photographic 
portraits during his Hollywood years, and several are shown for the 
first time in this exhibition.

Film star subjects included Ruth Ford, 
Paulette Goddard, Ava Gardner, Tilly Losch and Dolores del Rio.

Returning to Paris in 1951 he again made the city his home until his death in 1976. His portraits from the 1950s include experiments with colour photography, such as his portraits of Juliette Greco and Yves Montand, and the exhibition closes with his portrait of film star Catherine Deneuve from 1968.
