The British woman known was the White Widow is believed to have paid for three fake passports for herself and her two children, it has been alleged.

Known fraudster Ehmed Chisty said she spent £1,200 for the documents and it is suspected that she used them to set up home in Johannesburg.

Lewthwaite was named last week by Interpol as the world's most wanted woman following the Nairobi mall massacre and it has now been claimed she may have worked with a second jihadist from Britain in plotting the attack.

Umar Arshad fled Britain six years ago and has now reportedly risen up the Al Qaeda ranks and has been named in connection with the Westgate atrocity.

Six Britons were among at least 67 people murdered by Al Shabaab terrorists at the upmarket mall.

Muslim convert Lewthwaite, 29, is the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay. She fled her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 2009, and is on the run in East Africa.

Yesterday, a manager at a real estate company in northern Johannesburg said Lewthwaite had rented a home there between 2009 and 2010.

She used a fake passport under the name Natalie Faye Webb to apparently set up home in the country and weeks before the mall atrocity was allegedly spotted spying city on foreign embassies in the city.

Chisty, 60, who is currently serving a 37-year jail sentence for arranging thousands of fake documents, says Lewthwaite came to him for a forged passport.

He was quoted by The Mirror as saying: 'I think if I hadn't helped her, none of these people would have been killed.'

Lewthwaite is the world’s most wanted woman after Interpol issued a worldwide arrest warrant last week.

Security
measures in South Africa have come under scrutiny after the reports 
Lewthwaite was able to fraudulently obtain her passport.

Gwede Mantashe, secretary general of the ruling African National Congress, said: 'This
attack has highlighted the need for tighter immigration laws and 
processes, strengthening of the security features of the South African 
identity documents and the monitoring of the movement of people in 
general and suspicious movements in particular.'

Nine people have been arrested in 
connection with the attacks and five militants were killed during the 
four-day siege that began on September 21. 

Besides
more than 50 innocent Kenyans, citizens from Britain, France, China, 
Ghana, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Peru and the Netherlands were 
also murdered in the atrocity. 

However,
there has been a lack of information about the identity of the 
attackers, fuelling speculation that radicalised Somalis from the U.S. 
and Europe may have been involved.

There are fears 'White Widow' Lewthwaite has linked up with a second British jihadist Umar Arshad

Security officials have been quoted as saying that Arshad, originally from Manchester, who is known to have travelled to Kenya, may have linked up with Lewthwaite.

An unnamed security intelligence source told The Sun: 'We believe [Arshad] played a significant role in the Nairobi mall atrocity.'

Toaha Qureshi, a security expert, told the newspaper Arshad is in the highest ranks of al-Qaeda and known for his computer abilities.

He was put on a control order in 2007 and told to give up his passport but instead fled the country.

Arshad is currently on Interpol's 'no fly' list.

His family have previously said that the former Manchester University pharmacy student was converted by local extremists over a short space of time.

Arshad's family contacted the police over fears for his safety but despite being under surveillance he was able to leave the country.
