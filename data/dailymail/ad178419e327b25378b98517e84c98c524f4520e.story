Winston Churchill will be restored to the national curriculum as schools are ordered to teach children about Britain’s history.

The national curriculum for history, to be published by Education Secretary Michael Gove next week, will give all children aged seven to 14 a clear narrative of the major events between the Bronze Age and the present day.

The document, seen by the Mail, will state clearly that every pupil must ‘know and understand the history of these islands as a coherent, chronological narrative, from the earliest times to the present day’.

British institutions: Figures such as Henry VIII and Winston Churchill will be reinstated onto the history syllabus, which will be published next week. British history will take a more prominent role on the curriculum

Mr Gove is insisting that pupils learn about leading historical figures such as Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Oliver Cromwell and Queen Victoria.

Pupils aged 11 to 14 will also be expected to study ‘the Second World War and the wartime leadership of Winston Churchill’, the only modern politician who is mentioned.

He was banished from the curriculum in 1999.

The current national curriculum, last updated by Labour in 2007, leaves big gaps in pupils’ knowledge and ditched the learning of significant dates and events in favour of focusing on historical themes.

But the new curriculum makes British history the centrepiece of the curriculum, rather than, for example, the heavy emphasis on the Nazis.

It also calls for pupils to study ‘how people’s lives have shaped this nation and how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world’.

That will involve study of 
non-European subjects such as ancient China, India and Islamic 
civilisation, rather than the primary focus being on European history as
 at present.

Earlier this 
year, Mr Gove said he was worried that the curriculum and exams system 
‘mean that children thirsting to know more about our past leave school 
woefully undernourished’.

A
 senior Whitehall source said: ‘Children will learn a coherent 
chronological story of British history instead of Labour’s dumbed-down 
curriculum that leaves pupils with big gaps in basic knowledge.

They
 will learn about major global phenomena such as classical Greece, the 
Renaissance, and the Enlightenment, and about non-European civilisations
 such as China.’

The 
Education Secretary’s first attempt to rewrite the curriculum in 
February was condemned as too prescriptive by Left-wing academics.

He
 has compromised by leaving teachers some freedom to decide precisely 
what to teach. But he has stuck to his guns by ordering them to follow 
clear chronology.

Professor
 Jeremy Black, the senior history professor at Exeter University, who 
helped draw up the curriculum, said: ‘It is very important that we 
understand our national history as part of being an active citizen.

‘You can’t debate our sense of national identity and our national interest unless you understand our national history. This curriculum puts British history first as well, which I think is right.

‘It kicks out the woolly empathy in favour of giving children more of a sense of where we are at that moment between the past and the future.’
