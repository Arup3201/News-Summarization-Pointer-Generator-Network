Atletico Madrid’s Fernando Torres and Arda Turan are well known for their prowess on the football pitch but the pair have proved they can handle themselves in the kitchen.

The duo rustled up some authentic cuisine to celebrate Chinese New Year with a selection of children from the club’s training project partnership with Wanda.

Diego Simeone’s side fell to a damaging 2-0 loss at Celta Vigo on Sunday, leaving the reigning La Liga champions seven points behind leaders Real Madrid.

However Torres, who cooked at the event, is clearly relishing playing back with his boyhood club and has struck three vital goals in nine appearances so far back in Madrid.

Chinese real estate giant Wanda bought a 20 per cent stake in Atletico Madrid last month and part of their partnership sees young Chinese players visit Spain to train.

The two groups are set to combine to open three football schools in China, and each year Atletico will play in China to ‘bring advanced training and playing experience from Europe.’ 

Turan concentrates on preparing food during time out to celebrate Chinese New Year
