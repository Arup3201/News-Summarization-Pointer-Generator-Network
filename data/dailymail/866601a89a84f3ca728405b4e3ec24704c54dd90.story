Foreign Secretary: Britain will vote to leave Europe unless Brussels hands David Cameron major concessions, Philip Hammond warned yesterday

Britain will vote to leave Europe unless Brussels hands David Cameron major concessions, the Foreign Secretary warned yesterday.

Philip Hammond said it was ‘pretty clear’ that voters will reject EU membership in a planned referendum in 2017 without changes being made.

Mr Hammond, who replaced William Hague in last week’s reshuffle, confirmed he would vote to leave the EU – but insisted ‘substantive change’ in the relationship was achievable.

He said other EU countries agreed change was needed.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the ‘status quo is not an acceptable way to run Europe in future’.

Mr Hammond, arguably the most anti-EU Foreign Secretary the UK has had, added: ‘What I can tell, and have told my European colleagues, is that if the offer by European partners is nothing, no change, no negotiation, I am pretty clear what the answer of the British people in that referendum is going to be.’

He said there needs to be ‘substantive renegotiation, substantive change in Europe’.  

‘My job now is to pursue that renegotiation. When we get to the end of that process and we can see what is on offer, what is on the table, we will then make our recommendation to the British people,’ he said.

He added: ‘I haven’t changed my mind. If there is no change at all in the way Europe is governed, no change in the balance of competencies between the nation states and the European Union, no resolution of the challenge of how the eurozone can succeed and co-exist with the non-eurozone, that is not a Europe that can work for Britain in the future so there must be change, there must  be renegotiation.’

Mr Hammond’s comments confirm that his surprise appointment by Mr Cameron is designed to signal a distinct Eurosceptic shift, in an attempt to lure back Ukip defectors.

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he wins next year’s election – but only after attempting to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU.

Many Tories are sceptical about whether he will be able to achieve major concessions. He has not yet said whether he will lead a campaign to take Britain out if he fails.

Former Tory Cabinet minister Ken Clarke yesterday warned that the Tory debate on Europe had been hijacked by ‘right-wing headbangers’.

Mr Clarke, one of a dwindling band of pro-European Tories, said that ambitious Conservatives ‘feel obliged to say they’re Eurosceptic’ in order to progress their careers.

‘I’m not saying every Eurosceptic is unintelligent, but there are some pretty daft ones given very great prominence,’ he added.

Mr Clarke, 74, said he would stand for Parliament again next year, partly to help lead the cross-party campaign to keep Britain in the EU.

But he warned that if David Cameron wins the election he could face a repeat of the  ‘lunatic civil war’ over Europe that wrecked John Major’s  government .
