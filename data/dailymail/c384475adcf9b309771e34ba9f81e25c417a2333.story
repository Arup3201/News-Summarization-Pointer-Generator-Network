A man has been arrested in Mexico after he allegedly sent emails to the FBI and media outlets threatening to decapitate Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Aniruddha Sherbow, 43, was apprehended by California police Wednesday in Tijuana. He was then turned over to federal agents in San Diego.

The alleged threats occurred August 1 and 3, according to the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police.

‘I, Aniruddha Sherbow, with the Divine as my witness, do hereby solemnly vow to find Tulsi Gabbard, wheresoever she may be, and to sever her head from her body,’ he wrote to the FBI, according to the Hawaii Reporter, which said it had also received a copy of the email from Sherbow.

The FBI would not confirm the nature of Sherbow’s threat, saying only that it was based on a ‘credible’ threat. Sherbow will face charges of transmission of threats in interstate commerce, authorities said.

Sherbow will make his first court appearance later today before being returned to Washington.

Gabbard spokeswoman Heather Fluit said she had no comment other than that the first-term congresswoman ‘is grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation.’

Mr Sherbow reportedly has a history of harassment and threats targeting Gabbard, 32.

In 2011, Gabbard, who was then a city councilwoman in Honolulu, sought and received a three-year injunction against Sherbow after a series of abusive telephone calls and text messages.

Miss Gabbard told the Honolulu Star Advertiser in March 2011 that Sherbow had been ‘calling me numerous times, at strange hours’ and sending messages that were ‘extremely inappropriate, profane, vulgar and sexual in nature.’

‘Basically, taking it as far as he could go,’ Gabbard told the newspaper.

Gabbard said then that she contacted police after Sherbow’s messages became more abusive, including one that said if she approached him he would force her to perform a sexual act.

Miss Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and was elected to Congress in 2012. She is one of the first two female combat veterans, first Hindu and first woman of Samoan descent to serve as a U.S. representative. 

Mr Sherbow, a philosophy major and author who goes by the moniker 'Sphinx the writer', referred to Gabbard as 'The Prima Donna' who made his feel 'insignificant' in his correspondence with the Hawaii Reporter.

Sherbow told the paper that he had approached Gabbard offering to volunteer in her council office as a PR person, but was rejected by her and eventually thrown in jail without being charged.

The 43-year-old claimed that he was never served with the restraining order obtained by Gabbard, and said that he was falsely accused by the congresswoman of threatening her.

The aspiring writer told the paper that initially he wanted to reach out to Gabbard because they both hail from the Hare Krishna Movement.

‘Because of this last connection, I think she is counting on me not hurting her. And she is right to count on it, because it is in fact very difficult for me to hurt her,’ he wrote. ‘However, we all have our limits, and I have reached mine.’

He continued: ‘At this point, if you stuck Tulsi’s head in front of me, I’d have it off in two seconds flat. … I hoped the whole thing might have some good ending somehow, but I’m not seeing one.’
