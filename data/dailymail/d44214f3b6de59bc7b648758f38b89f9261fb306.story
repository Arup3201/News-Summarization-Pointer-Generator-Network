Phthalates are found in everything from car dashboards to shower curtains while bisphenol A is used in regular items such as till receipts, tin cans and sunglasses

Household chemicals blamed for everything from cancer to obesity should face stricter controls, leading scientists say.

A declaration signed by almost 89 experts, many of them from the UK, warns the existing regulation of phthalates and bisphenol A is ‘entirely inadequate’.

They say the gender-bending chemicals contribute to ‘high and rising serious levels of disease’ by interfering with key hormones.

Phthalates are found in everything from car dashboards to shower curtains while bisphenol A is used in regular items such as till receipts, tin cans and sunglasses.

Earlier this year, a report from the World Health Organisation declared the chemicals a ‘global threat that needs to be resolved’.

The latest declaration, presented to European Union commissioners, says the increase in many hormone-related illnesses is too great to be explained away by lifestyle and genetics.

Examples given include the ‘dramatic’ rise in breast cancer in eastern and southern Europe, the ‘strong’ rise in prostate cancer in almost all EU countries and the spread of diabetes and obesity.

The signatories of the 2013 Berlaymont Declaration, including many from London’s Brunel University, says EU members must subject these chemicals to more stringent testing.

The argue that some damage may be permanent, yet cheap and effective tests exist but are not used.

They also warn that for some chemicals, there may be no safe level of exposure and say that the existing regulations are ‘entirely inadequate.

Professor Susan Jobling, of Brunel University, said: ‘I and my colleagues are calling on the European Commission to implement a regulatory regime for endocrine-disrupting chemicals that is based on sound scientific principles.’

The campaign group CHEM Trust accused the EU of listening too much to the chemical industry and said the UK is in favour of some of the laxest controls.

CHEM Trust director Elizabeth Salter Green (CORR) added: ‘This flies in the face of the most up-to-date research that indicates that our widespread exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals is impacting our health.

‘Men’s sperm quality is deteriorating and hormone-related cancers are increasing – to name just two major health issues that are now strongly associated with exposure.’

The call comes as the EU reviews the way it regulates the substances.
