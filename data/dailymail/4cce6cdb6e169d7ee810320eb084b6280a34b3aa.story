A NSW physiotherapist who was charged with sexually assaulting three patients in his clinic last week, reappeared at court on Tuesday after two more women came forward with similar accusations.

Youngjin Jung has been charged with a further four counts of acting indecently towards the two women, in addition to the four charges from the three other women already laid against him.

The 34-year-old healthcare worker has been granted bail for a third time and will reaper at Woy Woy Local Court on August 15.

Two more women have contacted police following Youngjin Jung's previous two arrests, to allege they too had been indecently assaulted during appointments on the NSW Central Coast

Mr Jung was arrested for the first time on June 13 and charged with the rape and indecent assault of a 57-year-old patient at the Ocean Beach Road Physiotherapy clinic at Umina Beach on June 7.

He was released on bail to await his trial, but was re-arrested the next day at his Ourimbah home at about 7.30pm on Saturday when the second and third alleged victims, aged 47 and 52, contacted police following his arrest.

They claim they were indecently assaulted during physiotherapy appointments with Mr Jung at a Central Coast clinic.

Mr Jung was charged with four additional counts of indecent assault.

Only three days later, Mr Jung was charged for the fourth and fifth alleged victims.

A NSW police spokesperson said of the original incident: 'About 11.30am on Saturday 7 June 2014, a 57-year-old woman attended a physiotherapy clinic on Ocean Beach Road at Umina Beach for treatment.

'Police will allege during a massage, the woman was sexually and indecently assaulted.

'Police from Brisbane Water Local Area Command were notified and commenced an investigation into the incident.'

He has been granted strict conditional bail.

Inquiries are continuing and police are urging anyone with information to come forward.
