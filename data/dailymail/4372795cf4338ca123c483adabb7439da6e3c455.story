Recovery: Paul Sleeman, 27, pictured with his fiancee Emma Braunton, lost his father Peter

A father died as he tried to save his son from drowning after waves washed them into the sea during a fishing expedition.

Peter Sleeman, 60, threw out a life-buoy in an attempt to rescue his 27-year-old son Paul, who had fallen from rocks into the water after being hit by a wave.

But then another wave dragged the older man into the sea, too.

The pair struggled against the current for about half an hour, being ‘tumbled around like a washing machine’, as a rescuer described it.

When help arrived, it was too late for Peter Sleeman.

The younger man was told to let go of his father, who was face down in the water, and swim to the rescue boat to save himself.

Yesterday relatives paid tribute to Mr Sleeman, who had been fishing with his son at Tregardock beach, near Delabole in north Cornwall, on Sunday morning.

RNLI volunteer Damien Bolton, 31, from Port Isaac, Cornwall, was one of three crewmen called out to rescue the pair.

He said they arrived only just in time to save Paul Sleeman. ‘It was a high spring tide and the water was going right up to the rocks,’ he said. ‘We saw both the father and son close to the cliff. Their bodies were being tumbled around like a  washing machine, hitting them into the rocks.

‘The son was holding his father and both were in a life-buoy. The father was face down in the water. I told the son he would have to let go of his dad and swim towards us. He did not want to do it – but I told him he would die if he didn’t.

‘He had bravely held on to his dad until we got there – but then had to make the hard decision to let go of him and swim to us.’

He continued: ‘Just as he got to the boat, he went limp. I think another 30 seconds in the water and he may have died. He had taken on a hell of a lot of water and had cuts on his arms where he had been slammed into the rocks. It was very clear to us that when we got him on the boat it was literally just in time, but definitely without his dad’s actions the son wouldn’t be with us either.’

It is understood that before Mr Sleeman swam to the boat, he attached a line of rope to his father’s body and was able to bring the other end of it on board.

The crew then towed Peter  Sleeman to
water away from the rocks where they were able to pull in his body. It 
is believed he was already dead at this stage.

His son was kept in hospital overnight and discharged the next day.

Locals claimed that the secluded 
Tregardock beach, which can only be reached by clambering across cliffs,
had a history of drownings.

Rod Keat, 70, who grew up in the area
and lives two miles from the beach, said: ‘The tide washes right up to 
the rocks and the beach is covered completely by water.

‘Several people have been caught on 
the rocks in the past. There is no lifeguard and, without a phone, it 
would take at least half an hour to get to the nearest house.’

Distant relative, Gillian Davey, 43, from Delabole, said: 'Paul is very upset, but I don't think he is critical anymore.

'My mother-in-law rang me late morning yesterday. I know the pair of them went fishing at 6am yesterday morning.

'I then got a phone call late morning, early afternoon to say that Peter had died and Paul had been taken critically ill.

'It's awful what's happened. It's not a beach we go to very much. My husband is a fisherman and it's not somewhere he goes to.

'He probably hasn't been there half a dozen times in all his years he's been fishing.

'There aren't very many coast guards 
down there - really we're just thankful that there was people walking 
past to raise the alarm because it could have been worse.'

Karen Davey, 40, from Delabole, released a tribute on social networking site Twitter.

She tweeted: 'Sad news about a distant
cousin who lost his life on the Cornish coast today. Be careful out 
there guys, no matter how experienced you are!'

Ms Davey did not want to comment when contacted about the death.

Officers described the events, which unfolded at 8.30am on Sunday, as 'tragic'.

Insp Andy Oliver, from the force, said: 'This is a tragic incident with the quick actions of the father saving his son.

'It seems the dad threw in a life-belt
to try and save his son, but was tragically washed into the sea too and
later declared dead.

'They appear to be from Cornwall, 
visiting family in the area. The immediate next of kin have been 
informed. The incident will be referred to the coroner.'

Tregardock is a secluded tidal beach in north Cornwall known for its powerful waves popular with surfers.

Last night, locals claimed it had a history of drownings as there are no lifeguards and the beach can only be accessed by clambering down rocks.

At high tide the sea comes right up to the cliffs - which can catch some beachgoers unawares.

The beach is popular with locals because it is hidden away from tourists and offers stunning natural beauty.

A tourist website advertising accommodation in the area reads: 'Here there are crashing breakers, wild flowers, sea birds and vast, open skies.

'Walk down to the tidal beach and make footprints in its two miles of golden sand, explore the rock pools or surf the waves if you dare.'
