He had been savagely beaten and left for dead when a convoy of British soldiers discovered him while on patrol in Kandahar.

Now Wylie has marked a miraculous transformation from battered stray on war torn streets to win a prestigious award at this year's Crufts show.

Tonight he was crowned Best Crossbreed Rescue at the Scruffts show, which is part of the world's biggest pedigree dog show.

Wylie triumphed over five other dogs competing in the final of Scruffts.

His owner, Sarah Singleton, from Yeovil, Somerset, said: 'I am so incredibly proud of him.

'The journey he has been on from his beginnings in Afghanistan where he was near death so many times, to now in the main ring at Crufts is just amazing.

'By winning he represents all the rescue dogs in all the world.

'He has changed my life and is the most wonderful companion you could possibly wish for.'

Wylie was plucked from certain death by some
 kind-hearted soldiers in February 2011 who took him to an army base 
where he was treated for some horrific injuries.

The owner helped nurse him back to heath and now describes him as a 'gentle, 
trusting and loving dog'.

It is an extraordinary turnaround considering the state in which Wylie was found.

His ears were cut off - a long standing tradition for Afghan dogs used for fighting - and he was stabbed and run over by a car.

Back at base, Wylie was patched up by an Australian woman soldier, who feared he would not last the night.

Astonishingly, he did, but days later was back after dog-fighters had hacked off his ears, before cutting his muzzle open.

He was again patched up only to return with new injuries that included a stab wound to the chest and a severed tail.

After thugs threw him under a car the Australian soldier began planning to take him home.

Like many soldiers who befriended dogs during Afghan tours of duty, she knew of the work of Nowzad, which had been set up by Farthing, then a Marine Sergeant, after he broke up a dog fight in the Helmand town of Now Zad in 2006 and adopted one of the dogs.

Within months, the charity was formed.

'The relationships built up between a dog and soldier on bases can be very special,' Sgt Farthing, 43, from Exeter, said.

'A dog can ease the stress and provide five minutes of normality that is hugely important in that kind of environment.'

Wylie was treated by Nowzad vets before being placed in kennels in the West Country during his quarantine.

But he was refused entry to Australia.

One of his regular visitors was current owner Sarah, 35.

She says quickly a 'love affair with a lovely dog' began. He returned to England with Sarah where she continued the rehabilitation process.
