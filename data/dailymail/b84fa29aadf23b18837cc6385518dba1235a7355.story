Manager Alan Pardew tried to sign 
Cabella during the January transfer window following Yohan Cabaye's exit
 to Paris St Germain and finally has his man.

'This is a move that I really wanted to make,' Cabella said. 'I have heard nothing but good things about Newcastle United from everyone I spoke to.

'I wanted to join a great English club and that is why I have arrived here. I'm looking forward to pulling on the shirt and playing in this magnificent stadium, and I will give this Club my maximum.'

Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew said: 'Remy is a player who has been on our radar for a while and we are delighted to bring him to the Club.

'He is a player who I am sure will excite our fans. He has flair, hard work and commitment, and is going to bring a talent, energy and quality to St. James' Park that our supporters will enjoy.

'Remy has great ideas when the ball comes to him, and along with Siem de Jong is going to improve an area where we definitely needed some help.'

The 24-year-old was part of France's World Cup squad but failed to feature for Didier Deschamps' side.

Newcastle have lost Cabella's international team-mate Mathieu Debuchy, whose £11million move to Arsenal should be announced this week.
