A nearly two-year investigation into the death of a 19-year-old Ohio man has concluded that an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound killed him - even as his family continue to suspect that it was a murder.

State Attorney General Mike DeWine's office had investigated the March 2012 shooting death of Jacob Limberios and had called a grand jury to consider testimony.

Authorities said Wednesday that the grand jury declined to bring charges against anyone in the case.

The news comes just days after the Dr 
Phil show aired an episode in which two witnesses who saw Limberios die 
failed a polygraph test.

Gone before his time: Ohio officials concluded that Jacob Limberios, 19, pictured here with his young daughter, died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2012

Witnesses: Brittany Bowers (left) and Will Lewis (right) were partying with Limberios and another friend on the night of March 12, 2012, when Jacob allegedly shot himself

Fire power: Limberios was allegedly seen scratching his head with his magnum revolver just moments before the weapon fired

The Sandusky County coroner had ruled the death a suicide but also said the teen might not have known the gun was loaded.

His parents, Michael and Shannon Limberios, fought that ruling and hired their own forensic pathologist to do an autopsy.

Tireless campaign: Jacob's parents, Michael and Shannon Limberios, have questioned the investigation findings, which initially concluded that their son committed suicide

He concluded the death was a homicide after the teen's body was exhumed last fall.

In a statement released today by DeWine's office, the attorney general said that officials have gathered new evidence showing that Limberios ‘was likely holding the weapon at very close range when it fired accidentally without a trigger pull.’

‘In my opinion, we won today,’ Limberios’ mother told The News Messenger. ‘We always knew it was an accident. It was not a suicide.’

DeWine went on to state that investigators found that Limberios’ gun had a faulty safety mechanism.

‘What happened on March 2, 2012, was a horrible tragedy,’ said Mr DeWine. ‘However, we believe that Jacob Limberios did not intend to kill himself. His gun can fire without a trigger pull, and that put him in mortal danger.

‘Jacob Limberios did not commit suicide,’ DeWine stated. ‘He died in a horrible accident.’

Limberios' friends Brittany Bowers and William Lewis appeared on the Dr Phil talk show, which was taped in September but broadcast Friday, to answer questions about the night of March 12, 2012, when the young father allegedly shot himself, The News Messenger reported.

The pair agreed to undergo a lie detector test, which indicated that both Bowers and Lewis were deceptive when they answered 'yes' to questions about whether the 19-year-old Castania man killed himself.

Shocking outcome: Bowers and Lewis submitted to a lie detector test on the Dr Phil Show, which indicated that both were deceitful when they answered that Limbers shot himself

When faced with the results of the test, Bowers turned defensive, suggesting they were invalid.

‘Jacob, why the [expletive] are you doing this to me? Why?’ Bowers said, as she looked up. ‘Thank you for making my life hell.’

In 2012, Bowers and Lewis took polygraph tests and passed, although the validity of those results has since been called into question.

According to official reports, on March 12, 2012, Jacob, Lewis and another friend, Evan Neidler, gathered in Bowers' home in York Township for a party, where alcohol was served.

All four fired Limberios' .357 magnum revolver in the backyard before coming inside.

At around 9.30pm, Limberios allegedly took the gun and fired, striking himself in the right side of the head.

Gun enthusiast: Officials concluded that Limberios' revolver had a faulty safety mechanism, which made it possible for the gun to discharge without having its trigger pulled

Reckless: Attorney General DeWine said Limberios was handling his gun in an unsafe manner

Without examining the body, a coroner concluded that the 19-year-old man, who was engaged and had a young daughter, died of a suicide. That is what was written on his death certificate that was mailed to his parents.

However, Mike and Shannon Limberios were certain that one of their son's friends accidentally shot the 19-year-old.

‘We’ve made it clear from day one that we did not want to see anyone go to jail for this,’ Mrs Limberios told Dr Phil McGraw. ‘I have not changed my mind about that.’

Will Lewis insisted that he is not concealing any information from the victim’s family, and that he has been telling them the truth from ‘day one.’

Attorney General DeWine said Bowers and Lewis told police that Jacob appeared to be scratching his head with the firearm before it discharged. He added that the 19-year-old gun enthusiast 'was consistently handling this weapon in an unsafe manner.'

DeWine also said the lie detector tests played no role in the investigation findings.
