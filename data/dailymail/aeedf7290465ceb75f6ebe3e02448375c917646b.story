With as many as nine different bins and boxes, it is no wonder some of us find recycling fairly confusing.

But now councils have found a way of shaming those who sort their waste incorrectly – attaching red tags to the offending containers.

In a pilot scheme, those who put, for example, a margarine pot in a bin meant for plastic bottles, will find that instead of emptying it, waste collectors will attach a red label saying ‘wrong stuff, wrong bin’.

Binmen will also be issued with green ‘right stuff, right bin’ tags for containers that are correctly filled.

Yoghurt pots, plastic food trays and carrier bags are among the items most often placed in the wrong bin.

One area adopting the scheme is Bolton. Councillor Elaine Sherrington, the Labour authority's cabinet member for waste, recycling and housing, said: 'A large number of people in the borough already work hard at recycling most of their waste.

'However, some people still struggle to identify the correct items for each bin and this could be for a number of reasons.

'It is always good to try new ideas to raise the level of recycling, which in turn saves the town money. I hope people will get involved with this new initiative which should make a difference.'

Bin collection: Residents in Halliwell already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins (file photo)

Residents already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins, and under the pilot scheme - operating in the Halliwell area - if they dispose of an item in the wrong one, it will be left unemptied.

The Right Stuff, Right Bin campaign is being introduced into other areas of Greater Manchester, all chosen for their poor recycling record, and is intended as a short-term measure in conjunction with an information campaign.

An initial pilot in nearby Rochdale increased recycling by 56 per cent and reduced cross-contamination by 61 per cent.

The scheme is funded by Recycle for Greater Manchester which said the region's 42 per cent recycling rate cost residents £25million a year which would be better spent on schools and community projects.

Last week it emerged that Gwynedd council in North Wales is proposing to cut its rubbish collection to once every three weeks, to the fury of some residents.
