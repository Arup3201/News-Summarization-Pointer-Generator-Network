As the Wembley clock ticked over into the 89th minute, the booming PA system kicked in and proclaimed that Danny Welbeck was England's man of the match.

Sometimes the sponsors' choice is met with bewilderment, even derision. Not this time. The reaction was warm applause from all four corners of the stadium - universal acknowledgement and appreciation.

Welbeck had been excellent, by some distance the stand-out player. Direct and deadly, this was Danny at his game-changing best. Who needs Harry Kane?

Welbeck has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Arsenal this season but has six in four qualifiers for England.  

On a productive night, Welbeck blasted in the shot that led to Wayne Rooney's opener, stooped to divert home England's second, had three other shots on goal and tormented the Lithuanian defence with his pace, power and passing.

The goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with Paul Scholes - and he duly became the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with six goals, one ahead of Israel's Omar Damari.

Welbeck's touch map showed his influence right across the field, switching places with Rooney and Raheem Sterling in a dynamic front three that linked up seamlessly throughout.

The only dampener on the evening was the knee injury that will force him out of Tuesday night's friendly with Italy in Turin.

Which all begs the question - why doesn't Welbeck play like this for Arsenal?

Pushed out to the wing to accommodate the in-form Olivier Giroud, Welbeck has all-too-often looked a spare part in Arsenal colours this season following his £16m move from Manchester United last September.

The fact his England goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps Arsene Wenger should ask Roy Hodgson for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman.

Because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with Arsenal, the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub, inhibiting his performance. With England it somehow plays to his strengths.

With the Three Lions on his chest, Welbeck is content and confident, raising his game to a level rarely seen for the Gunners. There he can be aloof, slow and ineffective. 

The memes that often go viral on Twitter portraying Welbeck as a World Cup winner or with the Ballon d'Or are very much tongue-in-cheek but he can rise above the mockery.

At the moment, Welbeck is unlikely to displace Giroud, who has 17 goals in 26 games this season, but Friday night's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks.

Wenger should liberate him and say 'you're playing wide for the foreseeable future, but make it your own. Get the head down, get the legs pumping. When you run at opposition defences, it is a frightening proposition. Inevitably, positive play will lead to more goals. And more goals will lead to a sustained title challenge.'

Sure, it was only Lithuania but Welbeck doesn't select the opposition. He delivered against Switzerland and Slovenia too earlier in the qualifying campaign.

With goals comes the confidence to deliver against the top teams as well, in the Premier League, Champions League and Euro 2016 when it rolls around.

We now have the blueprint. Let's hope we see Danny deliver.
