Hillary Clinton jolted her supporters this morning with an 'Announcement' email, only it wasn't the type of announcement they were likely expecting.

Instead of declaring her candidacy for president, the former secretary of state told benefactors of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation that her family would personally match donations to the nonprofit before the end of the year.

The timing of the email coincides with Clinton's self-imposed deadline to fully embrace a presidential run or make way for serious Democratic contenders. The 2008 presidential candidate has said she would make public her decision early in the New Year.

It's not what you're thinking: Hillary Clinton's 'Announcement' this morning was that her family would match donations to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation

And while her email today was nothing more than a bait and switch tactic, she could take to take to the internet to make a formal declaration. 

On Jan. 20, 2007 Clinton launched a campaign website with clear message: 'I'm in. And I'm in to win.' She followed the statement with a video reintroducing herself to voters.

Traditionally presidential candidates have officially launched their campaigns at staged rallies packed with early adopters. 

Standing on the steps of the building where Illinois politician Abraham Lincoln began his political career, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama told a crowd of supporters on Feb. 10, 2007 that he would seek higher office.

And on June 2, 2011, Mitt Romney chose a 250-year-old farmhouse in the First-In-The-Nation state, New Hampshire, to make his challenge to then-President Obama official.

The days of televised in-person announcements may now be a thing of the past, however, as the internet and social media take on a more prominent role in political campaigns.

Jeb Bush, the first major 2016 candidate to confirm that he would 'actively explore' a campaign, made his intentions known in a Facebook post.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whose known for his robust Twitter presence, has also teased a presidential announcement on social media channels, tweeting a photo of a fake 'Rand Paul 2016' turtleneck last week. 

Not missing a beat, a spokesperson for the likely Republican candidate told DailyMail.com that the shirt referred to his 2016 Senate campaign.

Clinton's email this morning revealed little about her hotly anticipated campaign announcement. The email, sent on behalf of her family's non-profit organization, was strictly apolitical.

'This is a season to give thanks for our many blessings and to remember our responsibilities to each other – that we're all in this together,' she wrote, according to The Weekly Standard. 

'In my family, we're celebrating our first holidays with a beautiful new granddaughter. We're also celebrating the generosity and commitment of our incredible Clinton Foundation family – and that means you.'

Continuing, she told the foundation's donors 'there's so much more to do together' in the New Year, 'but we can't do it without you.

'That's why Bill, Chelsea, and I will triple every $1 donated to the Clinton Foundation before the end of the year, up to an additional $100,000.

'Support the life-changing work of the Clinton Foundation with a tax-deductible gift now, and we will personally match your donation $2 to $1, up to $200,000,' she said.

The email said gifts would go to 'empowering women and girls around the world,' helping 'parents and businesses take meaningful actions to improve the health and well-being of children' and 'bringing employers, educators, and young people together to help our kids get the skills and support they need to find good and fulfilling jobs,' among other initiatives supported by the Clinton Foundation.

'We have plenty of work ahead of us in 2015. I am so excited to move these initiatives forward,' she said.

'I know that there are no limits to what we can achieve together.'
