The Konyaks are known for their fierce headhunting history, which continued until 1960. Found in large numbers in Nagaland, India, the former warriors are recognised by their facial tattoos and the animal skin, hair and horns which are ceremoniously draped over their bodies. Here, Aidan McGloin describes how he and photographer Jean-Christian Cottu travelled to the remote Mon district to get to know the people behind the tribal exterior.

'In ten or perhaps 15 years, most if not all of these former Konyak headhunters and their wives will be dead. Their faded tattoo-adorned faces will be buried beneath Christian headstones in hilltop villages in the remote Mon district of Nagaland in north east India.

With their demise, the living memories of their unique cultural existence will disappear for eternity.

These stunning photos, featured in the series Nagaland, were taken by photographer Jean-Christian Cottu, who travelled to the remote Mon district of Nagaland, north east India, to document the Konyak people. Many members of the tribe do not know their exact ages and do not have a birth certificate. Pictured here are Ginwang, 95, left, and Phongwang, 84, right

These elderly men and women have lived through a time when tribal warfare still resolved certain territorial conflicts. Their backs, torsos and facial tattoos bear witness to mortal combat and the customary headhunting.

They were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity, which extended to the physical boundaries of their lands. They will die having intermittent access to limited aspects of modernity and having partially embraced a Baptist-based Christianity.

Jean-Christian Cottu’s photographs provide a visual record of these people. These are not anonymous, stolen images, as is too often the case. Importance is rightly given to the names, ages, and villages of origin of these people.

These images are by no means the only record of these former warriors and their families, but by taking a mobile photo studio, Jean-Christian wanted to go beyond the superficial cliché and instead capture the human dignity of these disappearing people.

The elderly men and women were born into and inherited a strong tribal identity and also embrace a strong Baptist-based Christianity, something which started to change the way the tribe operated. Pictured here are Phamman, 78, left and Pulei, 95, right

The former warriors are differentiated from other Nagas by the tattoos which are drawn all over their faces. Other symbols of the Konyak warriors are big pierced ears made ​​of animal horns and war hats made of hunted wild pigs horns, hornbill feathers and wild bear or goat hair. Pictured here are Wangjin, 92, left and Manbang, 78, right

Each photograph is the result of a material exchange, in the form of a printed copy of their photograph or a monetary one, in the form of a few hundred rupees, and on occasions both.

But the encounters were not merely restricted to nominal transactions. Our mutual curiosity was rewarded with undeniable human exchanges between us and some frank interviews.

These elderly people have had a long, unscripted past. They are living through a challenging present and face a diminishing curtailed future.

The Konyak warrior tribe is one of the many Naga tribes known for their fierce headhunting history and hunting skills and trophies won through hunting are worn as part of their costume, as shown above. Pictured here are Jaiyang, 90, left and Bawang, also said to be 90, right

The elderly men and women pictured by the photographer lived through a time when tribal warfare still resolved territorial conflict. They often wear a necklace with bronze faces, reflecting the number of heads they have cut. Pictured here are Gokpol, 88, left and Konwang, 76, right

These images and text attempt in a limited way to explain who the Konyak people we met are and to reveal a fraction of their respective stories.

When
 Jean-Christian asked me to accompany him on this project, I agreed to 
give a hand with the lighting and translate, on condition that I would also interview the people that he intended to photograph. I wanted to complement his images with some words.

So that those who would appreciate the beauty and poignancy of these photos might also have their curiosity rewarded with additional information about these unique people.

By observing their interactions with Jean-Christian’s mobile photo studio and by interviewing the Konyak people I was hoping to discover something about their identity, their way of life and how the recent generations have coped with change.

For the most part I relied on our guide Anyang to interpret my questions and their responses.'

The Konyak tribes have traditionally had a strong warrior tradition and are mostly famous because they were still headhunting until the end of 1960. But there are now young members being born into the community, left, who will lead the tribe in a new direction. Pictured here are Jaylen, nine and Wangnea, one, left, and Princess Lemam, 16
