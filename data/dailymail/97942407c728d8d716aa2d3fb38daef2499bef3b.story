Quotes from Adolf Hitler are stencilled on the walls around customers, as they sit in the controversial Nazi-themed SoldatenKaffe in Indonesia.

They don't seem to be bothered by the countless Hitler portraits, Nazi flags and other memorabilia that adorn the walls surrounding them, or the fact that the cafe's owner received widespread criticism and death threats when his business made headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons.

SoldatenKaffe has been accused of glorifying the Nazi party and its leader, and is still packing in customers a year after it reopened with even more memorabilia.

The owner promised to remove all offending posters and memorabilia for the reopening, but they remain

SoldatenKaffe glorifies the Nazi party and its leader and was forced to close its doors in 2013, with the owner promising to remove the offending swastikas and Nazi insignia.

However, when the cafe relaunched in June 2014, it not only retained the name of a cafe that was popular with Nazi soldiers in Paris in World War II, but also had even more artefacts on display.

The cafe had existed for three years in Indonesia's third-largest city before it was brought to media attention. 

The coverage sparked worldwide anger from many groups, including Jewish organisations.

The SoldatenKaffe was in business for over three years before it made headlines around the world

It was only when cafe owner Henry Mulyana received death threats that he decided to shut SoldatenKaffe, and take down the offending memorabilia.

He obviously had a change of heart when he reopened, as the prominent portrait of the Nazi dictator, posters, quotes and three iron eagles bearing swastikas, still remained.

As well as the questionable surroundings, at the cafe's launch men dressed in Nazi uniforms and others as prisoners of war.

According to Salon, customers can order Nazi-themed food served on a swastika-motif by SS uniform-clad waiters.

The menu includes 'Nazi goreng', which is a themed version of the traditional Indonesian fried rice dish, nasi goreng. 

Mulyana insists that there is no reason for anyone to be offended and the cafe's Facebook page insists it is not pro-Nazi.

It states: 'It is matter of fact, with the intention of exploring Hitler & the NAZIS as pop culture. The authors of the web page are not Nazis or neo-Nazis.'

 

The reopening incorporated a broadened theme to include several portraits next to the giant one of Hitler

The only defence Mulyana could give for the reopening is the broadened theme to include several portraits next to the giant one of Hitler, including British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Russian dictator Josef Stalin.

Mulyana once told reporters that the cafe draws a lot of customers from Europe, claiming they aren't bothered by the theme. 

He once said: 'I have a right to design my restaurant with anything that attracts people to come. I'm sure that I'm not violating any laws.' 

He insists that the cafe, which has a customer rating of 4.5 stars out of five on Facebook, continues to serve tourists from around the world.
