A revhead has lapped Manhattan in a record 24 minutes, seven seconds, despite stopping at six red lights on the 26.5 mile run.

Kicking off his dangerous high-speed journey at FDR/East Side Drive at 116th Street, just outside of Harlem, the unidentified driver cut cars off, dodged traffic and weaved across lanes to smash the 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds.

The illict speed racer, who posted a YouTube video of his August 26 race under the pseudonym AfroDuck Productions, has dismissed claims he is a reckless driver, saying he was in control the whole time.

While some car enthusiasts on motoring blogs have praised the unknown driver, others say he sets a bad example for young drivers.

However the driver has dismissed claims he was reckless while averaging speeds of 66 miles an hour.

'Whether you're a good driver or not, 
when you're on the road, you have a high chance of getting hit by a 
drunk driver, being cut off, especially in New York,' he told Jalopnik.com.

'Being
 a good driver, you're more aware of what is around you.

'Being a fast 
driver doesn't mean that you're inherently a bad or reckless driver.

'Like
 I said before, I'm in control. That said, understand traffic patterns, 
understand what's around you and understand how others control or don't 
control their cars.'

Record-breaker: The driver raced around the eastern edge of Manhattan and looped around the islandÂ¿s southern tip

Dare-devil: The motorist weaved through traffic in the city's tunnel but miraculously avoided a collision

Starting his lap just outside Harlem, the mystery man drove his manual 2006
 BMW Z4.P down under the Williamsburg, 
Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, then tore through the Battery Park 
Tunnel around the downtown tip of the island.

Footage of the journey, compressed into a six-minute clip, shows the driver zip through West Street/West Side Drive, which finally opens up in 
Midtown by all of Trump's buildings.

Heading north, he turns right by 
the George Washington Bridge in Washington Heights and gets across Manhattan at one of its narrowest points.

He turns back 
onto FDR/East Side Drive and races to the finish line, where he started the trip.

Sight-seeing: The driver was probably driving too fast to take in views of the Hudson River on the west side or the East River on the east side

New record? The driver claims to have completed his journey in 24 minutes and seven seconds - the fastest time ever

The driver said he prepared for the run by working out the traffic flows.

'Other than my car being stocked, I went out various times throughout the night to figure out the traffic patterns,' he told Jalopnik.com.

'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I 
broke the record. I can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most 
likely beat my own record again.'

He said he plans to release his name a year from now, and invites anyone to try and beat his record.

'Go ahead. Just watch out for the speeding tickets,' he said.

Illegal speed racer Alex Roy circled Manhattan in 27 minutes in 2001, reaching speeds of 144 miles an hour over the 24.48 mile distance. He never released the tape.

In 2010, another driver smashed that record with a time of 26 minutes, three seconds, released by Corporate Broadcasting Company.
