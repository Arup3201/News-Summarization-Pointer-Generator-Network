Catholic priests say they are living in fear after a clergyman was murdered on the final day of a music festival promoting religious tolerance.

Father Evaristus Mushi was shot dead by two men on motorcycles on the last day of the Sounds of Wisdom festival in Zanzibar and his death has prompted concern that religious tensions on the holiday island are increasing.

The Bishop of Zanzibar said members of the clergy are terrified of further attacks.

Since the murder on February 17 a church has also been set on fire. Five churches were torched on the island in 2012.

Bishop Augustine Shao was quoted as saying in Catholic News: 'We are very afraid'.

It is the fourth attack on Christian or Islamic clergy in the past four months.

Protestant pastor Mathew Kachira was killed on February 10, Catholic News reported, and Father Ambrose Mkenda was shot and wounded on Christmas Day.

In November a Muslim cleric was injured in an acid attack.

Bishop Shao said clergy have been sent threatening texts following Father Mushi's murder.

He told Catholic News that the type of attack 'is new to the country and we are looking for reasons', adding that the perpetrators could be using religion as a cover.

The island is classed as a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania and some believes that terrorists demanding independence from Tanzania are behind the murder.

It has been reported that priests and bishops in Tanzania received texts praising the Somalia-trained men who murdered the priest and warned of further attacks at Easter.

The bishop said warnings had also been 
received that the killings would continue until Muslim leaders jailed 
after disturbances on the island last year were freed.

The murder happened on the final day of the tenth Sounds of Wisdom festival or Sauti za Busara.

Yusuf Mahmoud, the festival director, told the crowd that a major purpose of the event was 'breaking down barriers between Muslims and Christians, black and white', according to The Guardian.

Three days later the Pool of Siloam Church was set on fire.

Police said three men stoned a security guard before setting the church alight.

It is the second attack on the church in two years. In 2011, 80 people pulled down the building.

The majority of islanders are Muslim, with Christians making up as little as five per cent of the population.

Retired Anglican bishop John Ramadhani told The Guardian that religion was being used for political goals.

He said: 'There has been harmony and toleration in the past but I think there is perhaps a belief that Christians should not be here.'

Father Mushi's murder has been condemned by the president of Tanzania Jakaya Kikwete, who has sent detectives from the mainland to assist in the inquiries.
