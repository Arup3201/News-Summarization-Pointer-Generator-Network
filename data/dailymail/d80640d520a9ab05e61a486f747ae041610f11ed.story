He may have trust issues with women - but that certainly doesn't stop Josh Elliott from bedding them, according to new reports.

It was revealed today that The Good Morning America anchor has been seen doing the 'walk of shame' from the home of WABC-TV anchor Liz Cho.

The reports come just one day after the 41-year-old was described as being 'high-maintenance' and having 'serious trust issues with women stemming from a difficult childhood' - but friends of the star say he considers these rumours to be 'hurtful'.

The couple were first reported to be in a relationship in September and a source told RadarOnline today: 'Josh has been seen sneaking out of Liz's apartment way early in the morning.

'It's been going on for at least three or four months, and she is in the middle of a really messy divorce.'

A source told RadarOnline: 'Josh Elliott, right. has been seen sneaking out of local anchor Liz Cho's apartment way early in the morning. '

Ms Cho, 41, split from her husband Evan Gottlieb over the summer and moved out of their Yonker's mansion with her daughter to a Upper West Side apartment - where Josh has been seen leaving in the early hours of the morning.

Josh is divorced from Priya Narang Elliot, the mother of his three-year-old daughter Sarina, while Ms Cho has a five-year-old daughter called Louisa Simone.

Radar claimed this week: ‘It's
no secret that Josh has major, major issues with women. Josh had a 
difficult childhood and as a result, has trust issues with females.

'He is extremely insecure and needs constant validation from everyone 
around him about how wonderful he is and what a great job he is doing.'

Rumors: Liz Cho, right, is said to want more than a fling with Josh but he has 'trust issues with women' and doesn't want to commit

The TV hosts were first spotted having dinner together in Manhattan in September sparking rumors of a fledgling relationship, but at the time friends said it was not a serious romance and they had been on a few dates.

The New York Post reported that Ms Cho and her ex-husband were embroiled in a nasty legal battle over renovation work done to their $2.2 million, nine-bedroom, four-bathroom Westchester mansion.

Cathal Maguire, a Yonkers contractor, claimed that Ms Cho and Mr Gottlieb racked up a $430,875 bill for upgrades made to their home and then stiffed him for $100,875 of the work.

Ms Cho and her spouse filed a counterclaim in state Supreme Court in White Plains alleging Maguire inflated prices, charged for work never done and did a shoddy job. The case is ongoing.

Meanwhile, It was also claimed that Josh has repeatedly clashed with co-host Lara Spencer 
over trivial issues, including how stories are covered, and the pair's off-air relationship is anything but amicable.

The only woman he is said to have any time for is primary anchor Robin Roberts.

'The only female Josh hasn't fought with is Robin Roberts, because he respects her for her previous work at ESPN, the source told Radar.

'He does have a daughter from his former marriage to Priya Narang Elliot, and that relationship ended in divorce.

'He is high maintenance, and if viewers could see what he was like off the air, people would be truly shocked.'

A Good Morning America spokesperson 
described the allegations about Elliott as 'absolutely false', adding 
they do not comment on the private lives of their anchors.

Elliot
was given up for adoption at birth. Then at 12 his adopted parents 
divorced and his father, who had told the family he was gay, died. In 
recent years he has made contact with his birth mom Susan and, briefly, 
with his biological father too.

‘I
got to thank Susan for my life, for not aborting me, for having the 
strength to ask that she be blindfolded in the delivery room (she said 
she never could’ve gone through with it, had she seen me) so she could 
give me what she believed would be a better life,’ he told The Big Lead 
in 2009.

'Trust issues with females': Josh Elliott has clashed with co-star Lara Spencer, right, but has a better relationship with Robin Roberts, left

Good Morning America is the most popular morning show in the country, but Lara Spencer, left, has reportedly clashed with her male co-hosts

The
upbeat vibe and jovial mood of ABC's Good Morning America is one of the
key reasons it has toppled rival NBC show Today in the morning ratings 
battle this year.

On
camera at least, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos, Josh Elliott, 
Sam Champion and Lara Spencer have created a winning formula.

Robin
Roberts is currently absent from the show while she receives treatment 
for the blood and bone marrow disorder MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome). 
She appeared via videotape on Monday’s show and said she 'can't wait to 
come back.'

Roberts
is considered a steadying influence on the show and insiders say things are more fraught in her absence. Co-anchor George Stephanopoulos 
particularly misses her professionalism and isn't a fan of Lara Spencer,
who has been standing in for Robin.
