Ashley Williams is ready to join Queens Park Rangers in a £4million deal.

The 29-year-old Swansea captain is in the final year of his contract and will be offered vastly improved terms to move to Loftus Road.

Swansea will listen to offers rather than lose him for nothing next summer.

Williams is expected to be one of several players to depart Liberty Stadium this summer. However, Swansea agreed a fee of £6.5m with FC Twente on Sunday for striker Luc Castaignos.

The Holland U21 international, who scored 14 goals in 31 games last season, is due to have a medical and discuss personal terms with Swansea this week.

Castaignos, 21, has spent the last two seasons in Holland after a short spell in Italy with Inter Milan.

Swansea had a bid accepted by Standard Liege for Michy Batshuayi last month but the player turned down the move.
