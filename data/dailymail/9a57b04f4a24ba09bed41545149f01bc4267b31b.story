The U.S. military is investigating a photograph that shows a soldier allegedly raising a gay pride flag at a base in Afghanistan.

The series of three photographs, which were originally posted on the wall of a Facebook group called ‘Wipeout Homophobia,’ have been incredibly polarising.

While the gay community is largely praising the flag-flying, some conservatives are livid, and are saying that U.S. troops are in mortal peril because of it.

Flying the flag: A Facebook user named Nicole Jodice posted this image to Wipeout Homophobia and wrote: 'hubbie in afghanistan raising a gay pride flag'

Sequence: The three photographs show an unidentified soldier placing the gay pride flag on a pole in what looks like a U.S. military base in Afghanistan

Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, is one of them. 

He wrote: 'There, in the dusty desert of war, an Army outpost saluted the colours of the homosexual lobby by flying a rainbow flag in place of Old Glory.

'These displays are an uncomfortable reminder of the open policy that few of the troops support.'

He placed blame on President Obama, accusing him for being intolerant toward religious freedom.

Gay pride: Last week, Norwich University became the first private military academy to host a gay pride week

A woman named Nicole Jodice posted the picture on the group’s Facebook wall on March 24th with a message that read: ‘Hubbie in Afghanistan raising a gay pride flag.’

The International Security Assistance Force told Fox News that it is investigating the incident, but said they were unsure where in Afghanistan the flag was raised, who was raising it, and the photograph’s authenticity.

Ms Jodice wrote in a follow up note that the picture was not Photoshopped, and thanked people for their support.

Mr Perkins compared the flying of the gay flag to the accidental Koran burnings earlier this year.

He wrote: ‘After February’s accident with the Korans, American lives were lost.

'What price will we pay because some want to use the military to show their gay pride?’

However, as Queerty.com said, Mr Perkins wasn’t as concerned over the Koran burnings a few weeks ago, saying it ‘doesn’t hold a torch to what’s happening to faith in America.’

The New Civil Rights Movement fired back saying that to Mr Perkins, ‘everything is an attack on Christianity. The mere fact that there are homosexuals in the military, now serving their country openly, is an affront to Perkins’ sense of religious entitlement.’

The gay pride flag, also known as the rainbow flag, is a well-known symbol of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender pride (LBGT).

The first known pride flag was made by Gilbert Baker for the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade in 1978.
