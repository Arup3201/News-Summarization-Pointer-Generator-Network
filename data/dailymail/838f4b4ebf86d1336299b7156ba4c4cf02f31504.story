Former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton might have grabbed most of the headlines for their speeches about courageous Americans at Saturday's dedication of a Flight 93 memorial.

But it was the thousand-strong crowd of ordinary Americans in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,  who really touched the hearts of the families of those who died in the crash on 9/11.

Around 5,000 people attended, including 4,000 invited guests and the crash victims' families of those killed when the Boeing 757 crashed into a rural Pennsylvania field.

It's an emotional day,’ Gordon Hasenei told AFP. His aunt boarded the ill-fated United Airlines flight in Boston for a holiday in San Francisco, California. ‘It's overwhelming to see everyone here.’

‘This makes me proud to be an American,’ Reverend Kenneth Mills, who was the uncle of United flight attendant CeeCee Ross Lyles, told AFP.

A seated section for the Flight 93 families had been set aside by organisations in front of the area where Mr Bush and Mr Clinton spoke of their determination to rid the world of terrorism.

The public were mostly from the local rural parts of Pennsylvania, wore patriotic clothing, held U.S. flags and sat down on leisure chairs in the muddy soil, reported AFP.

Alice Hoagland’s son Mark Bingham died in the incident, and she comes to Shanksville every year on September 11. This year she decided to touch a granite tablet displaying his name.

‘It's a healing process and I expect to go through it through the rest of my life,’ she told AFP.

Mr Bush was joined by Mr Clinton as the pair paid silent tribute to the victims of September 11 at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania the day before the official anniversary of the terror attacks.

Mr Bush was joined by his wife Laura, as he placed a wreath of white flowers by the 9/11 memorial stone embedded in the wall outside Corridor 4.

It is close to where hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the building, killing 184 people.

Also at Saturday's brief ceremony were Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Pentagon chief Donald H. Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen.

Current vice president Joe Biden joined the former presidents, families of the victims and several hundred others under a slate grey sky.

During the ceremony, the names of the 40 victims were read out, one by one, accompanied by chimes.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama is to join a two-hour commemorative service at the spot where Flight 93 went down - lifting the profile of a sometimes overlooked episode of the 9/11 attacks.

The memorial includes a walkway that sweeps past a circular field marked by a wreath-bedecked 17-ton boulder - the exact point where the Boeing 757 slammed at full speed into the ground.

The adjoining wall bearing the names of the dead retraces the direction in which it came down. Planted by the entry to the walkway are three young elm trees, representing the three 9/11 sites.

Notable upon the stage were the flags of Germany, Japan and New Zealand - in remembrance of wine merchant Christian Adams, 37, student Toshiya Kuge, 20, and lawyer Alan Anthony Beaven, 48.

A U.S. Navy brass quintet in crisp white
uniforms played a prelude. Award-winning bagpiper Bruce Liberati 
performed, as did Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan.

On Friday, family members of those who died on Flight 93 visited the site, read the guestbook and viewed the many mementos left by people who have come to pay their respects.

Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar spoke at the site on Friday and noted that there is still work to be done on the memorial. It will eventually include a Tower of Voices with 40 wind chimes.

Public and private donors have contributed $52million, but $10million more is needed to build a true visitors centre and to finish landscaping, Mr Salazar said.
