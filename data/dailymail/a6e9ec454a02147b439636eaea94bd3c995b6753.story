A Phoenix man who became ill after returning this week from Sierra Leone, one of the three West African nations hardest hit by an Ebola outbreak, on Friday was taken to a hospital where he tested negative for the virus, officials said.

The 32-year-old man, who was not identified, was transported to the Maricopa Integrated Health System in Phoenix for evaluation after complaining of sickness including dry-heaving and diarrhea, Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Mark Vanacore said.

Lab results were negative for Ebola, but the traveler will continue to be monitored in line with federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, Maricopa County health officials said in a statement.

The man told officials he had traveled to Sierra Leone, but Arizona officials said he had not treated Ebola patients, gone to funeral services or otherwise come into contact with anyone infected with the virus.

His symptoms developed after he returned to the United States on Wednesday.

The death toll in the world's worst Ebola epidemic has risen to 5,689 out of 15,935 cases reported in eight countries by the end of Nov. 23, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday.

Almost all cases and all but 15 deaths have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - the three hardest-hit countries, which reported 600 new cases in the past week, the WHO said in its latest update.

'The total number of cases reported in Sierra Leone since the outbreak began will soon eclipse the number reported from Liberia,' it said, adding that the capital Freetown remained the worst affected part of the former British colony.Â
