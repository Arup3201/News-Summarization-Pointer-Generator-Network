Adamant: The London Mayor lambasted the idea that a move to cut immigrants' child benefits could be hampered by EU law, claiming it is necessary

Boris Johnson is urging David Cameron to withdraw child benefit from migrants working in the UK despite an escalating row with Poland over Britain’s crackdown on benefit tourism.

The Mayor of London said the UK had become a magnet for those from countries with ‘much, much less generous welfare systems’.

He insisted there was ‘no reason at all’ why the UK could not stop paying child benefit to migrant workers, a move Downing Street insists would require an EU treaty change.

Speaking on LBC radio, Mr Johnson said Britain was open to ‘talented, hard-working people’ but accused Labour of losing a grip on immigration when it was in power.

He backed Mr Cameron’s plans to rein in the benefit payments paid to immigrants but said the Government could go further.

‘The payment of benefits is one of those areas under EU law that is devolved to government,’ he said. ‘We can decide who qualifies for child benefit. You’ve just seen it – the Government has just changed the rules [to limit child benefit for the better-off].

‘Why should British taxpayers be paying the child benefit of people who may be working in Britain but whose children are living in Poland?’

Mr Johnson also said that a new qualifying period before EU migrants are able to claim any out-of-work benefits should be extended from three months to two years.

According to Treasury figures, the UK pays child benefit to the parents of 40,000 children living in another EU member state.

A No10 spokesman insisted that restricting the benefit would require changes to EU treaties and that extending the qualifying period for incomers’ benefits to more than three months would be struck down in the European courts.

Mr Cameron said at the weekend that he wanted changes to EU rules that would allow Britain to limit benefit payments and pointed to Poles, among the biggest migrant communities in Britain, as an example of the potential for the rules to  be abused. 

Row: Cameron became embroiled in a row with Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski after suggesting we should cut immigrants' child benefits. Mr Sikorski accused the prime minister of stigmatising Poles

Attack: Mr Sikorski hit back at Tory suggestions to cut child benefits for immigrants from countries like Poland

It provoked an angry response in Poland, with prime minister Donald Tusk saying his country was ready to veto any legal changes allowing the UK to selectively cut welfare benefits.

The two leaders are due to have a phone call on the issue today.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage raised the temperature in the immigration debate yesterday by saying that it should be cut even if it slowed economic growth.

‘I would rather we had communities that felt more united and a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job,’ he said.
