Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be available to play for the Brisbane Heat in the entirety of the upcoming KFC T20 Big Bash League.

The 37-year-old was scheduled to play in the back half of the competition as a replacement for fellow overseas player Daniel Vettori, who is set to link up with New Zealand for their World Cup preparations.

But an injury to spinner Samuel Badree means Flintoff will assume the West Indian's place in the squad.

Cricket Australia has approved the change and Heat general manager Andrew Blucher said on the club's official website: 'It is very unfortunate for Samuel who was looking forward to playing in the BBL with us and would have been an exciting player to watch for our fans.

'But the upside for the Heat is that we have come to terms with Andrew to play the full season for us which is a wonderful result.'

Flintoff, 37, came out of retirement to make a return to action this summer with a handful of appearances in the shortest format for Lancashire, going close to helping them snatch victory over Birmingham Bears in the T20 finals.
