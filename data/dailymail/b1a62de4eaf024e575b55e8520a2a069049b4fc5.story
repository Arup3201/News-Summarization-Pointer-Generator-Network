Eight out of ten Britons say they want a referendum on Europe as turmoil on the continent puts pressure on politicians to hold a vote on the matter

A new Populus poll found half the population want an immediate say about whether or not Britain should retain European membership status, with 40 per cent of those questioned saying they thought the country should pull out of Europe straight away.

The survey, commissioned by The Times  found that only 18 per cent of people thought there was no need for a referendum in the foreseeable future.

However, the poll also found there was considerable uncertainty among voters with nearly three out of ten (27 per cent) saying they ‘didn’t know’ if the UK should be 'part of the single market in a wider European Community'.

When asked whether Britain should remain in the EU, keeping open the option of joining a more integrated Eurozone, 44 per cent disagreed, with 36 per cent saying yes and remainder (19 per cent) saying they 'didn’t know'.

The Government has played down suggestions that an announcement of a referendum could come as early as this autumn at the party conference.

While European markets reacted positively this morning to the news that eurozone leaders had agreed to loan Spain up to £80billion to bailout its struggling economy, Britain is expected to feel the impact of the economic turmoil in Europe within days.

Credit agency Moody’s is expected to downgrade the credit status of both Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland by up to two places imminently.

Barclays is also likely to be affected by the decision which will mean banks have to pay more to fund their activities.

Chancellor George Osborne wrote in a newspaper article yesterday that Britain’s attempts to rebuild its battered economy were being held back the crisis on the continent.

He said: ‘Our recovery - already facing powerful headwinds from high oil prices and the debt burden left behind by the boom years - is being killed off by the crisis on our doorstep.’

The results show a desire for a say on Europe coming from all sections of society with little difference between Conservative and Labour voters or the percentages of men and women in favour of a vote.

Out of Liberal Democrat supporters, 74 per cent are in favour of a referendum, compared to 82 per cent of the population as a whole.

According to Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary, even if it doesn’t come in the immediate future a referendum is inevitable when European treaties are rewritten to solve the European crisis.

Mr Osborne made this point last week when he said during a radio interview that any redrawing of European treaties would shift powers from the UK to Europe which would automatically trigger a vote under the terms of the treaty drawn up.

Although the nature of how any such referendum question would be worded is not clear with aides to the Chancellor stating that he had not intended to suggest that it would necessarily be a straight ‘in’ or ‘out’ question.

Ana Botin, chief executive of Spanish-owned bank Santander UK said the public needed to realise the close ties between Britain and the Europe and how a meltdown on the continent will have a serious detrimental effect on the UK’s prospects.

Mr Osborne’s move to blame Britain’s struggling position on problems in Europe has been criticised by both Labour and Conservative politicians with

David Miliband saying the problems were actually caused by the emergency budget and coalition cuts.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Osborne was making ‘desperate excuses’, while Conservative backbencher Douglas Carswell said it was ‘demonstrably wrong’ to blame the Eurozone.
