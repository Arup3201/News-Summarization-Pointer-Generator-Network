We all have a bad hair day from time to time but this emu didn’t let its straggly locks get it down.

Blissfully unaware, the bird paraded around its enclosure at Toronto Zoo with its tufts of messy curls wafting in the wind.

Photographer and web designer Tetyana Kovyrina spotted the scruffy Australian native while visiting the zoo and caught its bad hair day on camera.

The Ukrainian said: ‘They looked like they had just woken up and so just ignored us.

‘The birds weren’t paying any attention to the people in the zoo.

'I decided to take a few test shots and got really lucky - for a short moment the emu expressed some interest in the clicking sound of my camera's shutter and turned towards me.’

Ms Kovyrina said her photos had amused many.

She said: ‘Men's typical reaction is something like “Oh, that's my wife/girlfriend/mother in the morning".

Sleepy head: Ms Kovyrina thought the bird looked as if it had just woken up and after looking at her pictures, many men agree, saying it looks like their girlfriend, wife or mother after they've woken up in the morning

‘I try to trigger people emotions with my works; try to stir up their memories.

‘Photography became my passion about five years ago. The camera gives me an ability to freeze time, capture the mood, the lights and the atmosphere of the moment.’

The emu is part of the Australasia Outdoor Exhibit at the zoo which is home to more than 5,000 animals.

Biggest bird: The emu is one of more than 5,000 that live at Toronto Zoo (pictured) and is the largest native bird in Australia and the second largest in the world by height after the ostrich

The species is the largest native bird in Australia and second largest in the world by height after the ostrich. They grow to 60-70 inches tall and can weigh up to 115llbs.

They tend to live in sparsely wooded plains, desert and grasslands in eastern and southern Australia.

Their eggs weigh 1.5-2lbs, equivalent to up to 12 normal chicken eggs. The female usually leaves the nest after laying the egg, showing no further interest in the egg or her mate. The male then sits on the egg and incubates it for about 55 days without eating, drinking, defecating or leaving the nest.
