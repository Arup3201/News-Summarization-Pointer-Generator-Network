There are grave concerns for a seven-week-old baby who was allegedly abducted from a Canberra home by his father.

Police believe Garry Gordon took the baby from a house in O'Malley early on Sunday at 5.40am, while the child was in care of relatives.

Mr Gordon and the baby are thought to be headed interstate.

The removal of the child from the home is out of character for Mr Gordon, ACT police said in a statement.

They hold concerns for both the father and the baby, and are urging Mr Gordon to contact police immediately.

'The safety of the baby is our first priority. Garry, we urge you to contact us as soon as you can so that we know you and your baby are alright,' Superintendent Brett Kidner said.

The 25-year-old is described as 193cm tall, 140kg, with short curly red hair and was wearing a dark-coloured hoodie at the time.

He may be driving a 1993 grey Ford Falcon sedan with number plate YEB47J or a white Mitsubishi Solara 2001 with number plate YBR67P.

'Police hold grave concerns for the welfare of the baby and are asking for Garry to come forward,' it said.

Anyone who sees the man is urged to call police on 131 444.
