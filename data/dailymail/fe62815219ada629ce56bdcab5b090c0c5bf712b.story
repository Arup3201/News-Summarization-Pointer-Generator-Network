Star: Katherine Jenkins has hit back at her critics by revealing her down-to-earth nature, and her yearning to start a family

She has been branded ruthlessly ambitious and a prima donna. But now Katherine Jenkins has hit  back at her critics by revealing her down-to-earth nature – and her yearning to start a family.

In a candid interview with The Mail on Sunday, the 33-year-old superstar talks of her struggle  with the dark side of fame, and how her favourite gig of the year is a Christmas singalong with her family in a South Wales pub.

The mezzo-soprano, who has just returned from a tour of China to prepare for a festive performance at London’s Royal Albert Hall, said the highlight of her year is returning to her mother’s house at Christmas.

Jenkins also disclosed that she hopes to take a break soon to have children. ‘At some point in the next couple of years I’d like to have a family and hopefully be able to combine that with my music,’ she said.

‘That’s something that I really hope will happen. I might have to cut back on the travelling, for a couple of years anyway.’

The singer was less forthcoming about who the father of her children may be, but she remains close to Prince Harry’s stockbroker friend Adam Bidwell, whom she reportedly began dating in March. She was keen, however, to stress that despite leading a glamorous lifestyle, she has never been comfortable with all the attention.

One example of the type of scrutiny she faces came when commentators criticised her for wearing make-up while running the London Marathon this year in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support – despite the fact she raised £26,000 in memory of her father, who died of lung cancer when she was 15.

‘I would say that by nature I’m a sensitive person, and I certainly didn’t come into this for fame,’ she said. ‘I wanted to be a classical singer and when I was training to do this, classical singers weren’t celebrities, so I really just wanted to sing.

‘I wasn’t looking to be famous or to be photographed leaving a restaurant – that never occurred to me. So dealing with this kind of career path where people have got a perception of you that sometimes couldn’t be further from the truth is weird. It can be odd and sometimes it’s upsetting.

‘Fortunately my mum is amazing, and she will say, “Don’t worry, we all know the truth, come back to Wales and I’ll give you a cutch” – that’s Welsh for a cuddle!’

Last year Jenkins was dogged by claims 
that she was determined to ‘crack’ America when she appeared on Dancing 
With The Stars, the US version of Strictly.

But she explained that she 
received an invitation to participate out of the blue and took it 
because it came during a difficult time in her personal life.

‘It wasn’t the big masterplan that everybody thought it was,’ she said. ‘I read people saying I was trying to conquer America, and that I’d set this up months in advance – but they approached me in the middle of February and by the end of that month I was flying out there.

‘I was in a strange personal place at the time, and I thought, “I really fancy going away”.’

The upcoming Christmas break will be a rare treat for Jenkins, who has spent most of the year travelling the globe, most recently performing in the Middle East with tenor José Carreras.

She gets excited as she talks of heading home to Neath: ‘We go out on Christmas Eve to a local bar with my aunties and uncles and mum. Our friends have a band and they perform, so I’ll get up and sing Delilah with them. It’s just as much fun as singing with Carreras.’

Katherine Jenkins performs  at the Royal Albert Hall,  London, on December 9.  For more information, visit royalalberthall.com.
