A 63-year-old retired man in California has been charged with the 1989 stabbing death of a transgender woman at her home.

Police say Douglas Gutridge, 37 at the time, killed 35-year-old Carla Salazar in Santa Ana.

He spoke to detectives in the aftermath of the crime — and while DNA evidence linked him to the scene nearly six years ago, there wasn't enough evidence to file charges until a new cold case team stepped in.

'A case isn't just made on just forensic evidence,' said Chief Carlos Rojas, of the Santa Ana Police Department.

Christine McFadden (pictured), a friend of victim Carla Salazar, said she had given up on the justice system, but never gave up on Salazar, whom she loved like a sister

The motive for the killing is not clear, but investigators believe the pair had a brief, consensual relationship.

Salazar was killed on June 28, 1989, and had been seen in an elevator with a man earlier that night evening.

She was reported missing after missing work, and was found stabbed to death by a friend and her apartment manager, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Gutridge was arrested last week and is being held on $1 million bail.

He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

Close friend Christine McFadden (in red), was shaken up Thursday as she told reporters about Salazar's murder

One of Salazar's closest friends, Christine McFadden,she never thought they'd find a suspect, but learning an arrest had been made gave her hope.

'We gave up on the justice system but we never gave up on her,' she said.

Gutridge is expected back in court on January 2.
