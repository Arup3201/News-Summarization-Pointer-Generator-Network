Garry Monk insists Swansea are 'always looking to push forward' as he celebrated one year in charge of the club with a message on Twitter.

The former Swans defender took control of the club after Michael Laudrup was sacked amid a poor run of form in South Wales.

Monk has impressed in charge, bringing in several key players in the summer and establishing a mid-table position in the Premier League.

The 35-year-old posted on Twitter: '(sic) 1 year has flown by. Amazing support. Always looking to push forwards. #swans.'

In the background of Monk's picture is Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony, who recently left for Manchester City in a record sale at £28million.

Monk inherited a squad two points adrift of the relegation zone last season, and his mix of free-flowing football and results at the Liberty Stadium has been praised.
