Voters think David Cameron is ‘posh and out of touch’, Ed Miliband is a ‘weak idiot’ and Nick Clegg is a ‘spineless liar’, according to a survey.

A major poll by former Tory Chairman Lord Ashcroft reveals that most of the electorate have little good to say about the country’s top politicians.

The unflattering assessments emerged after voters were asked for the first word or phrase that came to mind when they thought of the main party leaders.

Tory Prime Minister David Cameron is seen as posh and out of touch, Labour leader Ed Miliband was a weak idiot and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was seen as weak and a liar

The most common descriptions for Mr 
Cameron were posh and out of touch, with voters also describing him as 
rich, arrogant and privileged.

There
 were few kind words, although ‘competent’ was the third most popular 
description amongst men and the twelfth most popular amongst women.

Voters
 were even less positive about the Labour leader, with most rating him 
as weak and an idiot. He was also labelled useless and untrustworthy, 
with women also describing him as slimy and boring.

The most positive assessment of Mr Miliband was that he is ‘trying’.

Mr
 Clegg was also subjected to a withering assessment by the electorate. 
Most voters view him as weak and a liar. Others described the Liberal 
Democrat leader as useless, spineless and a puppet. The most positive 
description was that he was ‘OK’.

Voters were not asked to describe Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

Polling by Lord Ashcroft showed Labour's lead was larger among women, according to a survey of 8,053 people in November 2013

The
 findings emerged in a survey of more than 8,000 voters, which revealed 
widespread public disillusion with Britain’s politicians.

However,
 Lord Ashcroft said the findings also dispelled the popular theory that 
the Conservatives have a ‘problem’ with women voters.

The
 poll, which was conducted in November last year, found that the 
Conservatives enjoyed the support of 30 per cent of men and 29 per cent 
of women. By contrast, Labour was backed by 37 per cent of men and 41 
per cent of women.

But
 Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The Conservative Party’s problem is not that it is
 attracting enough women – it is not attracting enough of anybody.

Pollster Lord Ashcroft said the polls show the Tories do not have a problem with women, but with all voters

‘The
 striking thing in the polls is not the gender gap, but the overall 
numbers of either sex who are prepared to say the Tories stand for 
opportunity or are on their side.

‘It
 is not women who have a problem with the Conservatives, it is voters.’ 
Number 10 is highly sensitive to accusations that either the Government 
or the Prime Minister himself are anti-women.

Mr Cameron was accused of sexism after telling Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle to ‘calm down, dear’ in the Commons.

Some
 analysts have also warned that the Coalition’s austerity drive hits 
women disproportionately. In the latest poll, voters were also asked to 
say which of a series of statements they associated with the different 
parties.

The Tories scored 
most highly for being ‘willing to take tough decisions for the long 
term’ and because they were ‘competent and capable’.

Labour scored highest for wanting to ‘help ordinary people get on in life’ and for being ‘on the side of people like me’.

When
 the results were separated by gender, women were less likely to rate 
the Tories highly over  decision-making and competency.

Women
 also gave four descriptions of Mr Cameron which did not  feature in the
 top 20 for men –  conservative, pompous, incompetent and family.

Almost
 all of the words associated with Mr Miliband were negative. Women 
dubbed him boring, unsure, slimy and annoying, while men  singled him 
out as being out of his depth, a geek, red, inexperienced and a 
socialist.

Some women described Mr  Clegg as nice, but most said he  was either boring, spineless, wet  or unsure.

The
 findings follow a poll earlier this week that suggested the 
Conservatives have a bigger problem with young voters, the electorate in
 Northern England and those from ethnic minorities than they do  with 
women.
