California Governor Jerry Brown has said he is not sure legalizing marijuana is a good idea in his state because the country could lose its competitive edge if too many people are getting stoned.

If pot smoking gains more legitimacy in the nation's most populous state, Brown said, he worries it could have negative ripple effects.

'The problem with anything, a certain amount is OK. But there is a tendency to go to extremes,' he said in a wide-ranging interview aired Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. 'And all of a sudden, if there's advertising and legitimacy, how many people can get stoned and still have a great state or a great nation?'

Up in smoke: Brown doesn't know if legalizing marijuana is wise for California

Californians voted to legalize medical
 marijuana in 1996. But Brown said he is watching closely to see how 
Colorado and Washington handle their new laws that go a step further by 
regulating the growth and sale of taxed recreational marijuana at 
state-licensed stores. Colorado's pot shops opened January 1, and 
Washington's are expected to open later this year.

'We
 have medical marijuana, which gets very close to what they have in 
Colorado and Washington.  I'd really like those two states to show us 
how it's going to work,' he said.

'The world's pretty dangerous, very 
competitive. I think we need to stay alert, if not 24 hours a day, more 
than some of the potheads might be able to put together.'

Brown,
 who was interviewed remotely from San Francisco, also discussed 
California's drought problems, climate change and his future political 
career.

Now, as he prepares to run for his fourth term as governor, Brown said that despite his progressive politics, the key to turning California's budget deficit into a projected multibillion-dollar budget surplus was exerting fiscal discipline.

'You've got to be tough on spending. No matter how liberal you want to be, at the end of the day, fiscal discipline is the fundamental predicate of a free society,' he said.

Brown also mused about the Democratic Party's future, saying he favored a Hillary Clinton bid for president in 2016.

'She's got more experience, both domestic and international,' he said. 'I mean, it's her nomination if she wants it, as far as I'm concerned.'
