Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column he gets behind beleaguered Sam Allardyce, notes Adam Lallana is ready to get on that plane to Brazil and reveals whose leg looks like a slice of stilton!

When your key players are missing as a manager, whether it's in schoolboy football, pub football or at semi-professional level, you don't win games. It's as simple as that.

Emotionally that's difficult for supporters to accept.

Hold tight: Sam Allardyce was right to write off the FA Cup because he has a depleted squad at West Ham

I fully understand why Sam Allardyce felt the need to write off the FA Cup game away at Nottingham Forest and you would have to be mad to have expected any different result in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad against Manchester City.

The dogfight to avoid relegation will go right down to the wire. The compensation figure to pay off Allardyce and his staff will be better off spent trying to hook a few loan players to come to West Ham to help strengthen their squad and save their season. He knows what he's doing.

Timely boost: Andy Carroll made his first team return during the impressive win away at Cardiff on Saturday

Think! Despite bad results recently, the compensation money to sack Allardyce is better spent on signings

Manchester City smashed seven past Norwich, Arsenal and Spurs were hit for six, Manchester United and Newcastle conceded four and they played a half-strength team away to Bayern Munich – the Champions League winners – and beat them 3-2.

They taught Allardyce's West Ham a lesson, too. It's easy to say you should be doing this and you should be doing that, but the City players are faster, stronger, far superior technically. It looks like Manuel Pellegrini has harmonised the expensive squad with calmness, confidence and a management style which is very different from Roberto Mancini.

Calmness personified: Manuel Pellegrini's cool demeanour has settled the Manchester City squad down

Adam Lallana is technically good enough to get into Roy Hodgson's squad for the Brazil World Cup and mentally he looks to have the confidence and arrogance to make the step up to get on that plane.

He showed that again with his well-taken goal to beat West Brom on Saturday.

It looks like he believes he's good enough and it looks like he believes he should be going. This mental hurdle is the most significant thing to overcome when you get to the top level.

Boy for Brazil: Adam Lallana has produced a number of eye-catching performances for Southampton

Cheers mum! The playmaker scored against West Brom and is in contention to go to the World Cup

The England cricket team have looked inferior in recent weeks and have been verbally beaten with barbed comments from Australia that have weakened their squad and dissolved self-belief.

They fought to take the Ashes back from us. Lallana is fighting for his place, with that Aussie spirit.

Jose Mourinho, Rafael Benitez, Arsene Wenger, Brendan Rodgers, Mark Warburton – what do they all have in common? None of them played football at a decent level but are making it as managers.

They've been to university, done this course and that course. Back in my playing days if you didn't play at the top level, you had no chance.

We're laughing! Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers are from the managerial breed who never made it playing

Not even Jason Puncheon's penalty miss against Tottenham. But I'll tell you what, I've got a lot of respect for Jason (right).

My
 friend Ray asked me if I'd seen the worst penalty ever shortly after it
 happened. He laughed as he explained that the penalty kick nearly hit 
the floodlights.

I
 reminded him that Puncheon used to play at my old club Barnet and had 
spells at Southampton, MK Dons, Blackpool; 11 clubs in total. And I also
 reminded him that in his time Puncheon had been in trouble with the 
law.

He was arrested in connection with a robbery seven years ago – but not convicted – and used to hang around with a bad crowd.

I admire Puncheon for not only turning his life around but also for maximising his undoubted ability, and
 for the courage and guts to take responsibility to grab that ball and 
take the penalty in the first place. My friend Ray just nodded in 
agreement.

My old club Brentford appointed a 
manager a few weeks ago who has never played professional football.

Mark 
Warburton had been a trader in the City when he started work at the 
Watford academy coaching, training and developing the youngsters and 
bringing through some good young players.

He moved to Brentford to work as director of football operations for his friend and very wealthy owner Matthew Benham.

Benham has invested heavily throughout the club and in a few years' time Brentford will be playing in a brand new 20,000-seater stadium in a prime location.

Mark has just won League One Manager of the Month and got the record of six straight league wins - the best start of any Brentford manager - and the team are flying at the top of the division.

Gone are the days that if you had 50 England caps you got a manager's job.

Now, you need to be up to speed with strength and conditioning, in-depth match analysis, have excellent communication and man-management skills, be good at delegation, international recruitment, nutrition, counselling... the list goes on and on and on.

Watch out for the rise of Brentford Football Club and Warburton. 

New kid on the block: Brentford are flying at the top of League One with Mark Warburton in charge

The players, supporters and owners of clubs at the bottom of League Two will be anxiously looking over their shoulders and scared stiff of the prospect of going to play in the Conference next year.

It's a good league, with lots of good professionals in it that have had to drop down with the influx of so many foreign players in the top leagues.

To get out of it, you need a mixture of David Blaine, Dynamo and John Still – the Luton manager who is five points clear at the top. Once you're in it, don't expect to come back too quick!

Eyes down! Northampton Town caretaker Andy King is trying to keep the struggling club in League Two

I see in the news that Thomas Hitzlsperger became the first Premier League player to come out as gay last week.

I don't think anyone cares, in this day and age, about homosexuality.

Who is seriously bothered about it? No one is nowadays. It's all part of life and the world we live in.

Who cares? Thomas Hitzlsperger came out as gay last week but modern society is beyond such prejudices

I now have the time to try to lose some weight and to help in my quest I joined the local gym.

I enrolled myself into a fitness class for a 10 o'clock start last Wednesday morning to do yoga.

I
 thought yoga was just stretching to improve flexibility and mobility, 
but as I lay there doing my utmost to loosen my hamstrings I couldn’t 
help but notice the lady next to me had a stilton leg – there were blue 
veins all over it.

She
 managed to stretch her hamstring, by pulling her straightened leg all 
the way back over her head, but I couldn't stop thinking how much it 
looked like a block of stilton cheese.

I
 was sweating, a little bit embarrassed and, as I kept staring at the 
blue veins, knew it was about time I got myself into shape.
