'Politics of envy': Ed Miliband has pledged to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million

Families who have saved hard to own their own home would be punished under Labour’s ‘mansion tax’ plans, a major insurer has warned.

Chief executive of Legal and General, Nigel Wilson, said the party was ‘pandering to the politics of envy’.

He fears that Ed Miliband's pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2 million would exacerbate the housing shortage and make it hard for first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder.

Mr Wilson said: ‘People who choose to prioritise buying a home have typically made sacrifices to do so: fewer foreign holidays, meals out or other luxuries.

‘Through no fault of their own, their prudence would be punished by a Mansion Tax.’

The threat of a levy had already slowed the top end of the property market and the drop in sales could reduce the amount of houses being built, he added.

Mr Wilson also said the levy was unlikely to raise even a tenth of the £1.2 billion that the shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it will raise as homeowners are likely to try and find legitimate ways to avoid paying the tax.

Under Labour’s plans, owners of homes worth more than £2million to £3million will pay £3,000 per year.

Owners of homes worth more than £3 million could pay as much as £30,000 per year.

Around 90 per cent of affected homes are in the capital and Mr Wilson says the tax would be ‘anti-London’.

He said: ‘The political attractions of a Mansion Tax on houses worth over £2 million are obvious. It’s anti "Fat Cat", it’s anti-London; and sends a message to those who can’t afford housing: “we’re on your side”.’

Mr Wilson also branded Labour’s plans as ‘a form of double taxation’.

He said: ‘Since the long-forgotten abolition of MIRAS, mortgages are paid out of income that has already been taxed.

The Liberal Democrats are putting forward similar proposals.
