A Danish MP has offended New Zealand’s Maoris by describing their traditional welcome dance as ‘uncivilised and grotesque’.

Right-wing politician Marie Krarup went 
on to say in a piece she wrote for a Danish newspaper that she was 
shocked to be welcomed by a dancing ‘half naked man’.

The traditional greeting, known as a powhiri, is given as an honour to visitors to New Zealand, but Miss Krarup has left the Maoris in no doubt that she failed to understand the value they all place upon the ceremony.

Miss Krarup recalled that when she arrived at the Devonport Naval Base, the headquarters of the Royal New Zealand Navy located on the North Island, she and the group she was with were greeted by a man shouting and screaming in Maori and poking his tongue out.

She felt like an idiot, she said, as she gave a hongi - rubbing her nose with a warrior - and the waiata, a Maori song, performed by naval personnel sounded like a Danish children’s song about a happy ladybird.

The song, she said, was accompanied by a ‘kindergarten-teacher-guitar-accompaniment.’

She dubbed the powhiri as an ‘uncivilised’ ritual and a marae, a communal or sacred gathering house, a ‘grotesque’ mark of multicultural worship.

Miss Krarup was part of a defence delegation visiting New Zealand last month.

‘When we came to a naval base, we were not received with a handshake or salute by uniformed men as usual,’ she wrote.

‘No we were welcomed with a Maori dance ritual, with a half-naked man in a grass skirt, shouting and screaming in Maori.’

The man, she said, performed ‘strange rituals and poked his tongue out.’    

Referring to the marae, she said the temple was ‘decorated with God-figures with angry faces and large erect penisis.

'It’s a mystery to me how the poor naval officers could endure both the ceremony and the surroundings.’    

Maoris said today that the politician clearly had no understanding about the local culture and should have, at least, had the decency to read about it before arriving in the country.

Maori culture expert Dr Ranginui Walker, said her remarks showed complete ignorance.

‘She has a totally monocultural view of the world and doesn’t understand that the welcome she received is the highest honour,’ said Dr Walker.

‘Maori customs had obviously not been explained to her before her visit.

‘Her remarks are very short sighted.

‘Very often politicians are not as well educated as they make out to be,’ he added.
