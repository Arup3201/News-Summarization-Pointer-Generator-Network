The soaring number of female doctors working part-time in surgeries is contributing to a crisis in GP recruitment, an official government study has revealed.

The Migration Advisory Committee said the 'feminisation of the GP workforce' meant more trainees were needed to maintain the same service for patients - because women are more likely to work shorter hours than men after they have children. 

This has contributed to  an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs, the committee warned.

In its report published this morning, the committee said more needed to be done to recruit family doctors – including hiring extra foreign doctors from across the EU.

The report said: 'It seemed that the health service could do more to source recruits from within the EU not withstanding what was said about problems with language and competency requirements.'

It said there are only around 20 GPs recruited each year from elsewhere in the EU – blaming the requirement to meet language and strict NHS standards.

But the committee also said more could be done to make becoming a GP more attractive to medical students.

It said: 'We did not see any evidence suggesting that there is a shortage of medical students who could continue into general practice.

'Therefore, any shortage of GPs could potentially be overcome by changing the incentive structure of GPs compared with other medical roles, in order to encourage more take-up on GP training programmes.'

NHS England recommends that there are 70 GPs per 100,000 population, but the UK is currently below this - at around 64 per 100,000 - and has been for some time.

Jeremy Hunt is struggling to fill an annual shortage of 450 to 550 GPs and has been encouraged to do more to hire doctors from abroad

Overall there are around 60,000 licensed doctors on the GP register.

The committee said it had considered adding GPs to the so-called shortage occupation list after a request by the Department of Health to allow the NHS to recruit doctors from outside the EU.

But it said there are enough medical students in the UK and Europe to fill the need.

The committee also rejected claims that there is a shortage of nurses that can be fixed by further recruitment from overseas.

But the committee has, for the first time, recommended that paramedics can be recruited through Britain's points-based skilled migration system after it found no other options to ease pressure on the existing workforce across the country.
