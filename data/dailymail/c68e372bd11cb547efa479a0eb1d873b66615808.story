The hackers who brought Sony Pictures to its knees over 'The Interview' are now demanding the film studio bow down further by removing all traces of the film from the web and ensure it is never released.

In a new email sent to executives at Sony Pictures, the hackers crowed about their victory after the release of the movie was canceled.

The group, calling itself Guardians of Peace, said it would not leak the remaining Sony hacked documents it has if the company complied with their demands, CNN Money reports. 

The company responded by taking town the website for 'The Interview' and turning the film's YouTube channel private so the videos can't be viewed by the public.

Erased: The North Korean hackers have demanded that all traces of 'The Interview' be removed from the web and that the picture studio never release the film or allow it to leak online

Sony Pictures executives say hackers are using their secret data to hole the company hostage. The group says it will stop the leaks if the film studio scrubs 'The Interview' from the internet

However, the trailer is still available on Apple iTunes and the Facebook and Twitter accounts for the movie are online.

The FBI announced on Friday that it had definitively linked North Korean hackers to the attack that left Sony reeling.

The hermit nation is believed to have lashed out at the movie studio over the final scene of 'The Interview' - a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy. The film depicts the violent death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. 

CNN Money reports that the new email to Sony execs said: 'Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy.'

'And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any hosting them immediately.'

The hackers are holding hostage even more of Sony's data and  plan to extract the company's compliance by promising to stop the leaks.

The emailed promised to 'ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble.'

Sony says it canceled the Christmas Day launch of 'The Interview' after hackers posted a threat promising 9/11-style attacks on movie theaters that show the film.
