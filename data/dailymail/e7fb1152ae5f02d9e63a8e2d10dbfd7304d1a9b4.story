The German football world has reacted to Manuel Neuer's defeat in Monday night's Ballon d'Or – and they're not happy.

In Germany, as across the globe, few were surprised when Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned footballer of the year. Many, though, were hugely upset by the margin of the Portuguese' victory, and by the fact that Neuer only came third in the voting.

Franz Beckenbauer was the most vocal critic, moaning on Sky TV that the result was 'an injustice'. He went on to attack Ronaldo, claiming that the Real Madrid player's appeal was more about his personality than his achievements as a footballer.

Bild wanted to know what their readers thought about Ronaldo's winning roar...

So, they created their own poll of 15 suggestions, including 'a drunken bear' and 'a deer in the mating season'.

'In 2013, Ronaldo won nothing, and Franck Ribery won everything. But Ronaldo beat him then, too. Apparently, footballing success doesn't count for much in these votes. It's all about your personal image', said the German legend.

The German media also stuck the boot into Ronaldo. Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel sarcastically argued that he deserved the award because, 'in a team sport, Ronaldo has always just been an individual player'. It then reminded its readers that 'the German team beat Ronaldo's Portugal 4-0 at the World Cup'.

Others were visibly annoyed by the victory cry with which Ronaldo closed his speech. 

Bild provided its readers with a list of 15 things the roar might have been mistaken for. Among them were 'Vladimir Klitschko's opponent after the second round', 'a deer in the mating season', and the cruellest of all: 'a drunken bear'.

Across Monday evening and Tuesday morning, almost every major figure in German football piped up to say that Neuer should have won the award. 

Former Bayern and Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said that 'strikers have it easier than goalkeepers, because people are more interested in goals'. Even Ronaldo's Real Madrid team mate Toni Kroos got in on the act. 'That Manuel only got third place is surprising and completely undeserved', said Kroos.

Then there were those who didn't want to complain, and so simply crowned Neuer moral winner of the Ballon d'Or. 'For me, he is the player of the year', Bastian Schweinsteiger tweeted after the ceremony. Former Schalke player and Twitter personality Hans Sarpei referred to Neuer as 'Player of the year in our hearts and minds'.

Germany could, at least, take some consolation in the fact that they won almost every other prize available on Monday night. 

The prizes for Women's Player of the Year, Women's Coach of the Year and Coach of the Year all went to Germans. Only Ronaldo got in the way of a full house. But in the end, nobody really expected any different. Even if he is 'a drunken bear'.
