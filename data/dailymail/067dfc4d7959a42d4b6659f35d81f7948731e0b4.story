All smiles: Dancer Falah Hassan wowed judges and the audience with his cheerful routine - but today he revealed his heartbreak over the murder of his parents by Syrian government troops

As Britain's Got Talent star Falah Hassan wowed judges with his cheerful dance routine, little did they know his childhood was in fact one of heartbreak - after his parents were brutally murdered by government troops in Syria.

Last night Falah, who has won a place in the next round, also told the Sunday Mirror how he was forced to flee his homeland and endured a dangerous journey hidden under a lorry to escape to Britain.

Aged just 12 at the time, the tormented youth was quickly granted asylum.

Speaking of his secret anguish, Falah, who is known by his stage name Poppin' Ron, broke down into tears as he described life under the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

Fearing for his life every day, he said: 'I couldn’t just go out and play football, because you didn’t know when the government would start shooting people whenever they felt like it.'

He revealed that he and brother Kovan would have died with their parents had they not been delayed getting home on that day in 2004 and says they were both 'saved by angels'.

Falah recalled how his father would always try to help others, providing them with food or giving shoes to young children.

But these acts of kindness towards his neighbours were frowned upon by the government.

One day, he and his wife were taken outside and horrifically beaten to death. The soldiers then set the family home alight.

When Falah and his brother returned home, they were tortured at the sight of their parents' bodies, before neighbours came along and hid them for three months.

He said: 'My brother and I were saved by angels and I thank God every single day.'

Falah eventually fled to neighbouring Turkey before embarking on a dangerous journey across Europe, hidden beneath a lorry.

The journey took nine days and Falah only had a little water to sustain him.

At Southampton, he threw himself off the lorry.

People thought he had been hit by the vehicle because he was bleeding, but the young boy could not speak English and he only knew one word - 'police'.

Falah believed he would be deported, but was eventually allowed to settle in the UK.

He was sent to a foster mother, Josephine Donovan, who enabled him to start a new life in Southampton.

Two years later he was joined by his brother, who is now 20.

With a talent for dancing, Falah became a teacher and decided to enter the ITV1 talent show as a tribute to his adopted mother and country.

Paying tribute to her, he said: 'My foster mother saved my life and she is the most beautiful person on the planet.'

He added: 'My heart is still broken, but Britain has given me the spirit to stay alive and continue fighting.'

The young talent revealed he has set his heart on helping others, like his father, and would like to open schools around the UK to help those less fortunate achieve their dreams.

While he feels fortunate to live in Britain, Falah added he finds it hard to watch news reports about the violence in Syria and describes the place he once called home as 'destroyed'.
