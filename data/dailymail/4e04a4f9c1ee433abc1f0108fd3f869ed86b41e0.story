Striking Spanish coal miners set up burning barricades and fought running battles with riot police as they protest harsh austerity cuts to coal subsidies.

In violent scenes, the masked protesters lit barricades of burning tyres and launched home-made rockets at groups of police bringing traffic to a halt along key roads in the north of the country.

Riot police retaliated with tear gas grenades and baton charges as they desperately tried to bring the situation under control.

Around 8,000 mineworkers from over 40 
coal mines in northern Spain are staging a nationwide strike organised 
by unions bitterly opposed to reductions in coal subsidies from €300 
million to €110 million.

Protests were today being held in Vega del Rey, near Oviedo, northern Spain and just outside the port city of Santander.

Miners holding a demonstration in 
Madrid on Thursday were baton-charged by police after a group started 
throwing stones and bottles.

Police said two people were arrested and nine were slightly hurt.

The official strike action began on May 23 last month. Eight miners are staging an underground protest.

Spain's economy is crisis having 
contracted for the second time since late 2009. Four years of stagnation
and recession have pushed unemployment to above 24 per cent, the 
highest rate in the European Union.

Today Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy 
said Spain will stick to harsh austerity measures until it emerges from 
financial crisis, promising that the country would survive the present 
economic turmoil.'

Rajoy acknowledged that the country is
experiencing turbulence, but said 'we are not at the edge of a 
precipice, we will not sink.'

'The government has "the will to persevere in this line for as long as is necessary,"'

Spain has imposed spending cuts and 
tax hikes to escape a crisis many fear could eventually swallow other 
countries using the European single currency.

Rajoy said he supported the creation 
of a single European fiscal authority to uphold the credibility of the 
euro, and acknowledged that for this to happen it would be necessary for
member states to 'surrender more of their fiscal autonomy'.

He said while it was possible Spain 
could have lived beyond its means, it was also true that those who are 
now criticising Spain - a reference to Germany - had also lent it money 
at very cheap rates.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has 
long maintained that austerity is the most important step toward easing 
the eurozone debt crisis, however, the leaders of some of those 
countries hardest hit - faced with anti-austerity demonstrations that 
have at times turned violent - have also called for steps to be taken to
try and boost employment.

Despite months of painful austerity 
reforms by Rajoy's conservative government, there is growing concern 
that its leaders have not done enough and Spanish banks may need to be 
saved from loans gone bad and foreclosures of property now worth far 
less than the loans paid out for it.

The country's banking sector is laden 
with soured investments on real estate and the government recently 
needed Euro 19 billion ($23.4 billion) to rescue just one bank, Bankia 
SA.

Some estimates have put a complete 
Spanish banking sector bailout cost at between Euro 50 billion and Euro 
150 billion, but Spain only has Euro 5 billion left in the Euro 19 
billion bailout fund it established in 2009.

Spain's banking sector, however, is 
not the sole issue. The economy is mired in its second recession in 
three years and is forecast to contract 1.7 per cent for the year.

This means the country has to raise 
money in bond markets and the interest rate on Spanish 10-year bonds 
finished trading Friday at 6.47 per cent, as reported by financial data 
provider FactSet.

A rate of 7 per cent is considered 
unsustainable in the long run. Countries such as Greece, Portugal and 
Ireland that have faced such rates have had to be bailed out.

Spain's current banking problems have 
startling similarities with Ireland. Both countries witnessed 
unprecedented property building and buying sprees enabled by their 1999 
entry into the euro.

It was an entry that many economists 
say was partly responsible for both countries' present problems - by 
entering into the single currency with more stable economies their 
credit-risk profiles were lowered giving their banks unprecedented 
access to international loans at rock-bottom rates.
