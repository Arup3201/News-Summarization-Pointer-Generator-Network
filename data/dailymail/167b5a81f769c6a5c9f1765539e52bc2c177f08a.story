A drunk man shot and killed a three-year-old boy while playing a game of 'gun tag', it has emerged.

Galen Hawk, 26, is facing up to 20 years in prison after being charged with negligent homicide following the tragic death of Lonato Moran-Allen on Wednesday last week.

Court documents state that the youngster had been pretending to shoot Hawk with a toy gun as he ran around his home in Ninepipes, Montana. Hawk  pointed a real gun at the boy in response and it went off.

Hawk told investigators he had been drinking whiskey and alcoholic lemonade during the evening prior to the shooting.

He said he had not believed that his gun was loaded and that he and the boy had only been 'playing'.

Following the shooting, Hawk attempted to perform CPR on the boy before driving him to a hospital in Ronan where he  later died.

The little boy was due to celebrate his fourth birthday on November 10. 

Hawk appeared in court on Friday where he was charged with negligent homicide. Bail has been set at $100,000.

Lake County Deputy Attorney James Lapotka showed the court a gun similar to the one Hawk used to shoot the boy.

He said, 'He chose to take a handgun, similar to this one. A 380 handgun, loaded, while he was intoxicated, and pointed it at a child.' 

Hawk's attorney said his client had requested to be released to attend the boys funeral. The judge did not respond to the request. 

A Lake County Sheriff’s Office's spokesman said investigators didn’t believe that Hawk was related to the boy.

However a tribute page set up following the death lists a Galen Hawk as one of the boy's uncles.
