Brutal crime: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier, 22, has been charged with killing her newborn baby by setting her ablaze in New Jersey

A woman accused of dousing her newborn daughter with accelerant, setting her on fire screamed 'it's not mine' as a man held her down, according to audiotape of a chaotic 911 call.

Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier of Pemberton was told that she was 'disgusting,' by a horrified woman who called 911 from the scene.   

Dorvilier told the woman, 'It's not mine, it's not mine,' then said, 'I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do it.' 

Authorities say the 22-year-old had given birth to the baby shortly before her death.

They say she somehow hid the pregnancy from her family.

When the baby was found, she still had the umbilical cord and placenta attached, investigators said. 

Prosecutors haven't specified a motive for the killing.

It took police and paramedics more than seven minutes to arrive at the scene in Pemberton Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, reports The Philadelphia Inquirer.

A dispatcher was initially unable to interpret the correct address from a frantic 911 caller, while another neighbor also reported fighting and screaming in the street before discovering the infant.

'There's a baby on fire,' the first 911 caller told dispatchers. 

In the background, a man could be heard telling Dorvilier to get down.

'You're not going anywhere,' the man told her.

Dorvilier's first audible words can be heard in which she says 'I'm sorry.'

'You just had the baby,' the 911 caller told Dorvilier.

'I didn't know,' Dorvilier replied.

'Well, then, who had it?' the woman asked. 'How could you do this? You should have dropped it off at the hospital.'

'I'm sorry,' Dorvilier says repeatedly.

The baby was alive and breathing when she was flown to a hospital in Philadelphia, but she died two hours later. 

Police said they found a trail of blood leading from Dorvilier's home and she appeared to be bleeding while at the hospital afterward.

Her mother and sister told police that they were not aware of her giving birth, but police said they found blood on the floor of the downstairs bathroom.

A witness said the woman told him she was burning dog waste. 

Dorvilier is charged with murder in the January 16 death of her daughter and is being held on a $500,000 bail.

She did not enter a plea during a hearing last week in Mount Holly, but said she planned to soon hire an attorney.

Dorvilier was found with a can of WD-40 and a lighter in her jacket pocket, and the baby suffered third-degree burns over about 60 percent of her body, investigators said in court documents released by Burlington County prosecutors. 

A memorial service was held Monday for the baby.

A vigil was held last week which Dorvilier's mother and two sisters attended. 

The baby has now been named Angelica Dorvilier by her family.
