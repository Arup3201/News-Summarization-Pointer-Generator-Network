Whether it's Y-fronts, boxers or patterned trunks, when it comes to underwear most men stick with what they know and like. 

And while different pockets of the nation yield their own outerwear trends, few would imagine that undergarments are as heavily influenced by geography.

But it seems men in some parts of the country have more in common with their neighbours than once thought, with different styles of underwear sweeping Britain's regions.

The underwear map highlights the different trends among male shoppers by region in Britain last year

While those in Scotland stick with trusty jersey trunks, men in Norwich and across the north west prefer Y-fronts - the favourite of local fictional character Alan Partridge.

Label-loving football cities like Manchester and Liverpool sell more designer underwear than any other kind, with Armani boxers a favourite among the male population. 

Tight, bright and patterned pants are the firm favourite in the north east, while further south,comfort triumphs over style, with those in the south west sticking with loose fitting, woven boxers. 

The trends were highlighted by consumer trends among male shoppers across Britain in a report carried out by John Lewis. 

And while most would think a man's underpants were safe from ever-changing trends, experts say what goes on underneath is just as important as what the rest of the world sees. 

Nick Keyte, Head of Menswear, said at the department store said: 'Understanding regional trends is a really important part of our job. 

'While comfort is key to men’s shopping behaviour when it comes to clothing, a continued trend to experiment with colour and prints has been reflected in our shoppers’ underwear choices. 

'The modern man wants to express his personality throughout his wardrobe.'

Londoners opted for more eccentric colours and patterns with the capital showing the highest number of sales for pink boxers and socks, a favourite of Prince Harry (pictured) 

The 2014 report revealed the changing ways Britons shop, with a fifth of all money spent on retail now being handed over online. 

This Christmas was the first year online shopping was more popular on mobile phones and tablets than at desktop computers.

Sunday was the most popular day for web-surfers and certain events saw a surge in specific items throughout the year. 

Bank Holiday weekends brought about a rise in the number of SatNavs sold, while the popularity of Channel 4 programme Goggle Box encouraged more people to buy TV dinner trays. 

Speaking of the research, titled How We Live, Shop and Look, John Street, Managing Director of the department store said: 'It seems fitting that in our 150th year as a retailer we are reflecting on the nation’s shopping habits. 

'Since our first shop opened in 1864, John Lewis has a barometer for changing trends and tastes.

'This year’s report is even more insightful than last year’s, with richer data, including new sections, such as how the nation shops for its children. We hope that in years to come people will turn to our report for a nostalgic glimpse of the trends that shaped the nation’s shopping habits.'
