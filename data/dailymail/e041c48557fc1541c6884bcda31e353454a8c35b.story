That Cyril Smith was a 
paedophile is known. But in a devastating book - serialised in the Mail 
this week - Labour MP Simon Danczuk exposes the industrial scale of his 
debauchery and how the Establishment, Liberal Party, police chiefs and 
even MI5 covered it up.

Today Danczuk, MP for Smith’s old Rochdale seat, reveals how the  29-stone monster was saved from prosecution time after time...

Cyril Smith, pictured celebrating being elected MP for Rochdale, would groom and abuse vulnerable teenage boys

This is the story of one of Cyril’s victims.

He was 16, living with adopted parents and hungry for new experiences, when he first met Smith in 1979.

His story reveals how shrewdly Smith would groom favoured boys — and how ruthlessly he then abused them.

A loud voice was booming outside the window. A big black Mercedes was crawling around our council estate with a Tannoy blaring out ‘Nice One Cyril’. A huge figure got out, strode purposefully across the road and knocked on our door.

I opened it and stared at this  smiling hulk of a man. ‘I’m Cyril Smith. Are you interested in politics, lad?’

‘Yes, I am.’

His face lit up. ‘Then perhaps I’ve got a new recruit. Why don’t you come and join us?’

I did just that, stuffing envelopes at his parliamentary campaign HQ and speaking to voters on doorsteps as he campaigned in the General Election.

I went to the count at the Town Hall to watch him win. The cheers nearly shook the building as Cyril was returned as the town’s MP for the fourth time.

I was working in a textile mill at the time. I’d never known my real mother, my dad was in prison and I’d been put up for adoption at an early age.

I was searching for excitement, risk, purpose. Cyril seemed to promise it. You could tell he didn’t live by the same rules as the rest of us.

It wasn’t long before I was a close member of his team and spending  more and more time at his office. I watched with awe at how he tended to constituents’ problems.

He’d listen attentively as someone told him how they needed a bigger council house for their  family, then he’d pick up the phone and the council would leap to attention and sort out whatever he wanted. Cyril seemed to have complete control over the public sector in Rochdale.

If you became a friend of Cyril’s, he’d make sure he looked after you. ‘You want to be a magistrate?’ he’d ask. ‘Leave it to me.’

He was well in with the free-masons, too. He could always get something done by calling a contact. In 1980, Cyril took me to the Liberal conference in Blackpool. We stayed in the Imperial Hotel and I loved it. Cyril could see I was completely overawed. He laughed and tousled my hair.

Method: Smith's victim met him while he was out campaigning with a car using a Tannoy, as in this picture

Back
 in Rochdale, he asked me to come for a drive late at  night. ‘Let me 
get my mum to bed first,’ he said, and then he picked me up.

Cyril
 was dressed in his pyjamas and slippers. He drove us up into the 
Pennines and pulled up by a stone wall in a remote spot. I remember 
looking at his huge clenched fist on the handbrake. I could see the 
whites of his knuckles.

He 
leaned towards me. ‘I’m not going to be in politics for ever,’ he said. 
‘If you stick with me, I’ll  make sure you’re the next MP for Rochdale. 
I’ll show you the ropes, I’ll groom you. It can be yours if you want 
it.’

His face was an inch away from mine now and I could smell his breath. The leather seats squeaked as his weight shifted towards me. As he spoke, his hand slid down my inside leg and he began to pull me towards him. I know now I should have screamed and punched him in the face. I should have got out of that car and never turned back. But I didn’t. I sat there frozen as he groped me, moaning and groaning and burying his face in my neck.

I didn’t say a word. My heart  was pounding.

In the years that followed, I lost count of how many times he did this to me. I could tell by the look on his face that he knew he had complete control over me. My background meant I had hardly any confidence or self-esteem. I’d never had a girlfriend and Cyril’s world was exciting and unpredictable.

He treated me like a sex object. I got used to seeing dark clouds  of lust cross his eyes — then  he’d create opportunities for us to be alone.

At one point, he even groped me in Parliament. He’d taken me there a few times and introduced me to all kinds of people.

I remember meeting Labour leader Michael Foot and watching the pair of them laughing hysterically at things that weren’t in the slightest bit funny. I wondered if you had to be mad to get into that place.

In Cyril’s office there he was all over me — with the door open, too. Politicians walked past, but no one said anything. It was as though different laws applied to the  people there.

'The door was open': His victim says he will never forget how Cyril Smith, pictured with then Liberal leader David Steel in 1977, abused him in the House of Commons

Eventually, I was tired of being used. He’d taken what little self-respect I had and trampled all over it. He’d made dignity a foreign word to me. Sometimes I looked in the mirror and felt sick at what I saw. I even dreamed of killing him.

Everyone has a breaking point, and I now saw Cyril for what he was — a fat, middle-aged, lonely man who liked abusing boys. His problem was that he’d become intoxicated with power. He was reckless and took risks, but he knew he’d get away with it.

By 1985, I was married and left Rochdale and Cyril Smith behind for good. When he died, I couldn’t watch the simpering politicians on TV as they fawned over him and talked of his legacy.

He was cremated, but if he’d been buried I would have torn  his gravestone down. I phoned  the chief executive of Rochdale council and told him if they built  a statue in memory of him I’d  personally get a digger and  demolish it.

Hate is a powerful emotion and it’s one that I fight with constantly. I don’t want to be owned by it, but I can’t forgive Cyril.

How on earth can a politician get away with molesting 16-year-old boys? And how many more were there like me?

You know the thing that’s stayed with me most? It’s his laugh. Utterly mirthless, loud and hollow. Sometimes I can still hear it now.
