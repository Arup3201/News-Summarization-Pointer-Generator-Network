England captain Chris Robshaw will make his return from injury when Harlequins host Aviva Premiership opponents Leicester on Saturday.

The Quins flanker has been sidelined since he suffered a shoulder injury almost five weeks ago.

His comeback comes less than a month before England launch their RBS 6 Nations campaign by tackling Wales in Cardiff.

In further good news for England head coach Stuart Lancaster, Quins skipper and national team prop Joe Marler is also back from injury, and he joins Robshaw in the starting XV.
