Sam and Billie Faiers have lost a stone each in less than 12 weeks, so it's no wonder that they wanted to showcase the results of their efforts.

The TOWIE stars displayed their enviably toned figures in a photoshoot to launch their winter clothing range for their store, Minnies Boutique.

Sam, 22, has lost a stone through sensible eating and intense group workouts.

23-year old Billie also lost a stone, three inches off her waist and dropped a dress size in less than 12 weeks thanks to a DNA-based diet and fitness regime.

New figures: Billie (L) and Sam Faiers (R) have each lost a stone and celebrated by posing in their new winter range for their store, Minnies Boutique

The DNAFit test, which examines gene variants linked to a body’s capacity to cope with training and certain types of food, revealed that Billie loses weight most successfully by following a low-carbohydrate diet – proving that old TOWIE adage ‘No Carbs Before Marbs'.

Speaking about her weightloss, she said: 'I now feel I have more energy and am less sluggish. I’m really happy with a more toned body, dropping a dress size and losing three inches from my waist.

'I still want to lose another six pounds
but this test has given me the confidence to know what I should be 
doing in the gym and what foods I should avoid. I’ve so much more energy
now I’ve reduced my carb intake.'

Before and after: Billie (pictured left before her weight loss in Marbella) has shed a stone by cutting out most carbs 

As she was: Sam, pictured left before her weight loss, has also shed a stone by eating sensibly and working out more - and you can see the results as she models her Polar dress, right, £49

Biggest loser: 23-year old Billie lost a stone, three inches off her waist and dropped a dress size in less than 12 weeks thanks to the DNA diet (velvet houndstooth crop top, £20)

She works out: Sam, 22, has lost a stone through sensible eating and group work-out sessions (L- brown houndstooth shorts suit, £87, and R - leather sleeve biker jacket, £60)

Entrepreneurs: The sisters have been running Minnies Boutique for two years now and are loving every minute (lacey sweater dress, £55)

She can't be stopped! Billie says she feels less sluggish since cutting out carbs but still wants to lose some more weight (L- electric blue dress, £34, R- Himalayan coat, £89)

Sam and Billie showcase
their weightloss efforts in the new campaign and sport typically 
glowing tans, toned physiques and blinding pearly whites.

The
range, which includes graphic prints, fitted dresses complete with 
pussy-bow collars and cosy faux fur coats, is priced between £34 and £89.

Speaking about the new range, the sisters told MailOnline: 'Minnies Online is always busy and continues at a fast pace, but in the past 6 months we have been busier than ever.

'When we are buying we have to predict the latest trends and what we think people will go mad about. We really take time to get to know our customers and work out what they will want to be seen in.'

The reality TV stars have
been running 
their lucrative business in Brentwood, Essex, for two years and have 
seen such success that they have launched a series of pop-up stores 
across the UK.

'Our Pop-Up Shop Tour has been so 
successful over the past two years and in constant demand so we 
have scheduled two more Southern and Northern dates before the end of 
2013.'

Exciting: The sisters say they can't wait for 2014 and have lots of exciting ventures on the go (L- Minnies dressing gown pink, £39.99, R - Eav sweater, £42)

Billie added: 'Minnies is a family project. We all work together to make it a success. My mum and aunt Libby are 
the owners with myself and Sam, and we take care of the buying 
and making sure the stock is right online and in the boutique while 
they run the business and retail side.'

Speaking about the future of their fashion empire, the duo said: 'We are looking forward to 2014 which is going to be our most exciting year yet. 

'We have so many Minnies and personal projects lined up that we can’t wait to hit the ground running'.

All items are available from Minnies Boutique Online: www.minnies-boutique.co.uk – The Minnies Boutique Pop Up Shop Tour will be visiting Southampton’s WestQuay Shopping Centre on the 30th November & 1st December 2013 & Preston’s Fishergate Shopping Centre on the 7th & 8th December 2013.
