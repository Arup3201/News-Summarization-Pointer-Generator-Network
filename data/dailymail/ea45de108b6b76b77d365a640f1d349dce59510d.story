A curious kitten had to be rescued after getting its tiny head stuck in the parasol hole of a garden table.

The eight-week-old feral cat found his way into a garden shed in the Lee area of Lewisham in London, where the table was being been stored and became wedged inside it.

Luckily his cries were heard by a passer-by who called the animal charity and when they opened the shed, they discovered the exhausted cat completely stuck.

Eight-week-old kitten Parasol, who got his tiny head stuck inside the parasol hole of a garden table inside a shed in Lewisham 

Officers were then forced to contact an on-call vet from the nearby Celia Hammond Animal Trust to sedate the kitten - now named Parasol- to stop him from struggling and possibly injuring himself.

The table then had to be dismantled so the kitten's head could be freed safely and it is unknown how long he had been stuck for. 

RSPCA Inspector Nick Wheelhouse said: 'A member of the public heard a young cat's cry and upon investigation found the kitten with his head stuck in the parasol hole of a wooden table. 

'The poor little thing was completely stuck and struggling to free himself.

'We had to be very careful not to hurt him, so we asked a vet from Celia Hammond Animal Trust to sedate him and keep him safe while we dismantled the table to free him.

Parasol has been paired up with fellow stray Marina left, and both are now being cared for by staff including vet Serena Holmes and volunteer Jade Lockley at the Celia Hammond Rescue Trust centre in Lewisham, right

'Thankfully once he was sedated the kitten was freed from the table and was taken back to the surgery to be checked over.'

Parasol is now recovering from his ordeal at the Celia Hammond Animal Trust's centre in Lewisham, although he did not suffer any injuries. 

He has been paired up with another kitten, a black cat called Marina and it is hoped that they will be rehomed, finding new owners together.

Lesley Mills, rescue and rehoming manager at the centre said: 'Parasol is doing extremely well. Thankfully he just needed some TLC to get him back on his feet.

'He has now made a friend in Marina and we are hoping they can find a home together once they are both ready to be rehomed.'
