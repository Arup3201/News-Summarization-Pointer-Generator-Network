George Osborne is poised to scrap Labour’s controversial 50p tax  rate next week – despite Coalition infighting over the Budget that is set to go to the wire.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg, the Chancellor and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander again failed to settle the row yesterday over how to cut the tax on those earning more than £150,000 without appearing to favour the rich.

A final meeting on Monday will be held  to thrash out a deal, just 48 hours before the Budget is delivered.

They have already missed last night’s deadline for handing over their plans for assessment by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, although sources insisted a way could be found round this.

Labour yesterday branded the Budget preparations a ‘shambles’ and said the focus on the 50p rate suggested ministers were ‘completely out of touch’. But Mr Osborne is pressing to scrap the tax as a signal of his commitment to building an enterprise economy.

 

He is expected to set out a timetable for reducing it before the next election, possibly to a rate of 45p.

Insiders say he believes there is a brief ‘window of opportunity’ to ditch the tax before the election run-in. A Treasury-ordered review is expected to show the tax has raised just a few hundred million pounds in its first year, rather than the £2.5billion initially estimated.

Some Tories are furious with the Lib Dems over leaked reports claiming that the 50p rate would be slashed to 40p next week. The Chancellor is said to have ‘hit the roof’ over the leaks.

Although Lib Dem sources seem resigned to an end to the 50p rate, they are demanding in return ‘concrete’ action to tax wealthy individuals. Proposals include a mansion tax on homes worth over £2million or a ‘tycoon tax’.

David Ruffley, a Tory member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘The Lib Dems’ megaphone diplomacy is deeply counter-productive. The 50p tax rate will ultimately cost this country dearly and should be scrapped immediately.

‘But there is little point cutting it if the Lib Dems are going to be allowed to slip in a brand new wealth tax.’

The Chancellor is also looking to underline his pro-business credentials by slashing the corporation tax rate. He announced plans last year to reduce it from 28p to 23p by 2014, and could lower it further to 20p.

And he is considering a tax break to help develop Britain’s video game industry.

The Liberal Democrats are demanding new taxes on the wealthy as 'compensation' for agreeing to axe the 50p tax band.

Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander are anxious not to be seen to go soft on the rich and are demanding concessions from the Tories.

An annual mansion tax could be imposed on properties worth more than £2million or there could be a new 'super' council tax band to hit the owners of the biggest properties.

Alternatively, they could opt to cut pension relief for the wealthiest.

Mansion tax - The idea to hit properties worth more than £2million with a new tax was first mooted in the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto.

Under the proposals, mansion owners will face a new annual tax bill equal to 1 per cent of the value of their property.

However, it is unlikely to be brought in because the proposals have met fierce opposition from the Tories. Such a tax would also be very expensive to administer as all property values would have to be assessed.

New council tax band - The owners of the largest homes could be forced to pay a new 'super' council tax rate.

The value of properties in England was last assessed for council tax purposes in 1993. It is hard to see how a new band could be imposed without re-assessing the value of all homes.

The Tories ruled out carrying out such an exercise in September 2010 - and if they performed a U-turn the cost would likely run into billions of pounds.

Clamp down on pension tax relief - Billions could be saved by scrapping tax relief currently given on pension contributions by people who pay income tax at the higher rates of 40 per cent and 50 per cent.

Currently, staff paying into an occupational pension have amounts taken by their employers before tax is deducted, enabling them to get full relief straight away, depending on what income tax band they are in.

Those making contributions into a private pension get immediate tax relief from the Government at 20 per cent, the basic level of income tax.

Higher-rate taxpayers can then claim the difference through their tax returns or by contacting HMRC.

Lib Dems have proposed halving the tax relief for those paying 40 per cent income tax, a move that would hit millions of middle earners including higher-paid teachers and nurses.

Mr Osborne is unlikely to agree to go that far, but reducing the tax relief for those earning more than £150,000 a year, and therefore enjoying 50 per cent relief, would be more palatable to Tories. That would affect the 320,000 top earners in the country.
