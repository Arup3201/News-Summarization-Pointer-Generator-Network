David Cameron has insisted that new powers for HMRC allowing them to seize money from people's bank accounts is necessary if people want to avoid tax rises

Taxes will have to rise unless HM Revenue and Customs is given new powers to raid bank accounts, David Cameron insisted yesterday.

Amid controversy over whether the taxman should be allowed to take money to settle debts without permission, the Prime Minister suggested one of the alternatives was to ‘raise tax rates’.

In a TV interview he said: ‘We have a choice here.

‘If we don’t collect taxes properly and [don’t] make sure people pay their taxes properly we look at the problems of having to raise tax rates.

‘I don’t want to do that, so I  support the changes the Chancellor set out in the Budget which is to really say that not paying your taxes is not acceptable.

‘It is very clear that they can only do this if there is a debt of over £1,000, they can only do it if there’s £5,000 or more in the account after this has been completed.

‘The principle is do we want to pursue every avenue of making people pay the taxes they are meant to pay before we put up taxes – because that’s the alternative – absolutely, yes we do.’

Joint accounts could also be targeted – even if one of the account holders is not being chased by the taxman.

HM Revenue and Customs insists it will not take money from anyone with less than £5,000 in their bank account in order to stop people being left cash-strapped.

But accountants say that means revenue dodgers would simply avoid being targeted by moving their money out of their bank accounts.

MPs have already warned that the power granted to HMRC to remove cash from bank accounts without court orders is ‘very concerning’.

They believe taxpayers could suffer ‘serious detriment’ if officials take money from people who have done no wrong.

A string of critics say the proposals, which were contained in the fine print of the March Budget, could also end up  punishing the innocent.

Eamonn Butler, director of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said: ‘Plans to allow HM Revenue and Customs to take money directly from the accounts of tax delinquents are a fundamental assault on the rule of law.

Under new proposals, the taxman would be allowed to take cash from anyone who owed more than £1,000, as long as it left at least £5,000 in their account afterwards

'Next year is the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, but the basic civil  protections it gave citizens against arbitrary power are being systematically eroded.’

Emma Carr, from Big Brother Watch, said: ‘These plans represent nothing less than HMRC wanting to act as judge, jury and executioner.

‘These powers would increase the risk of HMRC wrongly collecting money from taxpayers, a warning that the Government and Treasury would be reckless to ignore.’

Confidence in the tax authorities has been eroded by a series of errors, including sending incorrect tax codes to  millions of pensioners over a number of years.

Alex Henderson, tax partner at accountants PwC, said the ‘potential consequences have not been thought through’.

‘This could lead to the situation where struggling businesses are pushed under,’ he said. ‘Imagine if it then turned out HMRC had made a  mistake. You might get your tax back but that doesn’t help you if you’ve lost your job.’

Patrick Stevens, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute for Taxation, said: ‘The type of people we’re after, who are smart and have decided to give HMRC the runaround, will make sure there isn’t enough money in their account for HMRC to go after.’

He added: ‘Allowing HMRC a free run at bank accounts will end up with some very unhappy little old ladies.’
