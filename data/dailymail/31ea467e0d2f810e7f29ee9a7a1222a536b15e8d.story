The Middleton women ensured they were well coordinated for the Jubilee pageant, each sporting a different shade from the Union Flag as they took to the river Thames.

Mother Carole opted for a sophisticated cream dress and jacket while her youngest daughter Pippa, 28, wore a chic navy skirt and matching jacket by Irish 
designer Orla Kiely.

Meanwhile 30-year-old Kate, who was aboard the royal barge with husband Prince William, cut a swathe 
through the gloomy weather wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen dress and matching headpiece by Sylvia Fletcher for royal milliner James Lock & Co.

On her lapel, she wore a maritime-themed brooch featuring two silver dolphins - a gift from the Royal Navy Submarine Service of which William is Commodore in Chief -  and carried a scarf made of Strathearn tartan, a nod to her Scottish title the Countess of Strathearn.

Carole and Pippa, flanked by Mr Middleton on their left, and brother James on their right, waved as their vessel - a recreation of a 19th-century stern-wheeled paddle steamer - wended its way down the river.

The fact that they have been included
 in the Royal Squadron – a handful of boats sailing behind the Queen – 
is a strong sign of the monarch's cordial relations with Kate’s family.

Shortly
 before last year’s royal wedding she invited Mr and Mrs Middleton, who 
run a company selling children’s party goods, to dine with her privately
 at Windsor Castle and subsequently included them in her carriage 
procession at Royal Ascot.

Sources
 say the Queen appreciates how close her new granddaughter-in-law is to 
her family and feels their relationship continues to give her enormous 
stability.

Other VIP 
guests on the vessel include Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 
Olympic organising committee, and his wife, Lady Carole.

'Michael
 and Carole’s inclusion on Elizabethan took a lot of people by 
surrprise, but the Queen is incredibly supportive of the duchess and her
 family,’ said a palace source last month.

'Boats travelling in the Royal 
Squadron are solely reserved for special guests of the Queen, which 
demonstrates just how far the Middletons have come.'

One of the largest charter boats in London, the Elizabethan has the interior of a modern restaurant and nightclub.

The
 235-seater vessel also has an upper-deck walkway which offers the 
largest outside area of any Thames riverboat and will provide its 
occupants with an unrivalled view of events on the day.

The normal cost of a charter for the privately owned boat is £650 an hour.

The
 £10.5million pageant has seen a flotilla of 1,000 boats and more than 
20,000 participants take to the water in the largest celebration to be 
staged on the Thames for more than 300 years.

Stretching
 more than seven miles, the cavalcade – which includes a remarkable 
floating belfry and several orchestras and choirs, is en route down the 
Thames from Battersea to Tower Bridge, with an estimated worldwide 
audience of a billion.
