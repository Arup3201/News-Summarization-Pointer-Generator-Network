A major search for a baby feared lost at sea has been called off after police said they believe initial reports that an infant fell from a ferry were incorrect.

The land and sea operation, costing tens of thousands of pounds, at the mouth of Belfast Lough was triggered after a woman plunged from the Stena Line boat as it made its way into port from Cairnryan in Scotland last night.

The 37-year-old Belfast woman was rescued within 15 minutes and taken to the city's Royal Victoria Hospital for treatment, where she remained in a stable condition today.

At the time of the incident it was reported that a baby had also entered the water with the woman, prompting extensive searches that began last night and continued this morning.

But after a complex police 
investigation, which included interviewing the woman's family, officers 
said they no longer believe a child was in her care at the time.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesman said: 'Police have called off the search operation in 
Belfast Lough which began yesterday evening after a report that a baby 
had gone into the water with a woman who was later rescued.

'Following an extensive search 
operation involving several agencies and volunteers and after enquiries 
with the 37-year-old woman and her family, police now understand the 
report of a baby going into the water was incorrect.

'Police do not believe there was a baby in the woman's care on the ferry. The woman, who is from Belfast, remains in a stable condition in hospital. Police enquiries are continuing.'

Coastguard
rescue teams launched an urgent hunt for the infant last night but 
called it off after almost four hours as darkness fell.

This morning helicopters, boats and divers continued to scour a large area of Belfast Lough, close to Holywood, County Down, as they resumed their search for the child.Â 

A spokesman for the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'It's very difficult to put a figure on the rescue because we have volunteers and people sitting in operations as well.

'Generally speaking it would have been thousands of pounds, but generally we would never put a value on a human life and we would put in all the resources we thought were necessary for a given situation.'

The mother, who was from Northern Ireland, was traveling on a Stena Ferry when she fell into the water.

She was in the water for around 15 
minutes before being rescued and is being treated at the Royal 
Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The ferry, which had travelled from 
Cairnryan on Scotland's western coast, was preparing to dock when the 
incident happened at around 6.15pm last night.

Coastguards received a call from the ferry reporting that two people were in the water in Belfast Lough.

One person was recovered by the pilot
boat and taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at 6.25pm, 15 
minutes after the alarm was raised.

John McPoland, a spokesman for the 
Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, said two ambulance crews treated the
woman who was in a stable condition.

The spokesman added: 'She
had been in the water for a while so you can understand that with the 
coldness of the water she would have been hypothermic.'

Last night four lifeboats searched the water alongside a police craft and two helicopters, with 
the rescue co-ordinated by Belfast coastguard.

Police Service of Northern Ireland officers boarded the ferry, which is docked in Belfast Port.
