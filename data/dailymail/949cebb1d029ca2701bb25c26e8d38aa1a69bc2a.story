Basement flats are considered by many to be down-at-heel and gloomy. Perhaps this is because in many Georgian and Victorian houses, they were originally used as quarters for servants working for the wealthy owners residing upstairs.

Their reputation was hardly enhanced in the 20th Century when, having been turned into independent apartments, some were put to use as brothels or illegal drinking and gambling dens.

However, in recent years canny developers have realised that subterranean apartments in upmarket areas of London can be bought comparatively cheaply and then, with inventive lighting, be transformed into highly desirable abodes.

Kate Maitland, 43, a horse-breeder from Hampshire, has certainly done well out of realising the potential of basement flats.

She has bought a succession of apartments in West London, renovated them, rented them and used the equity she has made to move up the property ladder.

She bought her first in West Brompton, West London, for £310,000 in 2008 and is now selling her latest project, in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, for £700,000.

‘I mainly work with lower-ground-floor flats as I know they are generally not the dark, damp, pokey basement many people seem to visualise them as before viewing them,’ she says.

‘The lower-grounds I look for are usually part of large, impressive houses, with steps leading upstairs to the ground floor.’

Transformed: Kate Maitland's two-bedroom basement flat in London's Chelsea on which she spent £90,000 to convert into a bright and inviting home below ground

After her success with the West Brompton flat, Kate successfully developed two basement apartments in Earls Court, including one she bought for £371,000 in April 2010 that had been home to 19th Century Irish painter John Butler Yeats and later the notorious ‘madam’ Cynthia Payne.

Kate spent £80,000 refurbishing it and sold it for £560,000.

She bought the two-bedroom flat in Cheyne Walk with her property-developer brother Rupert for £405,000 in February last year.

In terms of location, they knew they were on to a winner – Cheyne Walk is one of the most upmarket addresses in the country, with a long list of famous residents that includes Rolling Stones Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, 19th Century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, footballer George Best and actor Laurence Olivier.

The property looked particularly pokey due to a number of large cupboards that lined the rooms, and it had been on the market for some time. But Kate and Rupert instantly recognised its potential.

They removed a fireplace in what was the front sitting room to allow plenty of space for a good-size double bedroom, and by disposing of one of the larger cupboards they were able to create a wet room.

They turned the kitchen into an entrance 
hall, opening on to a study/second bedroom with doors that slide into 
the wall, and freed up the back rooms so they could be used as a sitting
room and kitchen, with a door to the shared garden.

Exclusive address: The flat is located on Cheyne Walk in Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea

It took about six months to complete the £90,000 conversion, mainly due to objections from the other freeholders in the building.

The flat is now for sale with Cutler & Bond, an estate agent that specialises in lower-ground-floor properties in prime areas of the capital. Tim Day, the 43-year-old  Londoner who set up the firm, says that the very mention of a basement flat can send shivers down the spine of prospective buyers.

‘If you take ten buyers, eight of them will not even consider them,’ he says. ‘European buyers, for example, can’t get their head around them.

‘The whole notion of subterreanean dwelling is alien to them. Middle Easterners won’t touch them either.

‘But they offer excellent value for money,’ he adds, ‘typically going for 40 per cent less per square foot than the floors above.’

Day also points out that because lower-ground-floor flats tend to have their own entrances, they feel more private than the flats on the floors above.

They also often have the advantage of access to a garden at the back.

But what Day and Maitland both insist is that often the biggest advantage of basements when it comes to selling is that they appeal to buyers who will not compromise on location – and they don’t come much more exclusive than Chelsea’s Cheyne Walk.
