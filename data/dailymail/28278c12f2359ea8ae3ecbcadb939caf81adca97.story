An American saga of redemption and recovery unfolded in dramatic style at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Sunday.

Wearing red was JB Holmes, who has recovered so hearteningly from two bouts of gruelling brain surgery four years ago. Wearing blue was Dustin Johnson, the party boy who took a six-month leave of absence to mend his wild ways.

In the end it was the man hell-bent on his redemptive mission who came out on top as Johnson closed with a final round 69 to win by one from Holmes, who had begun the final round with a five shot lead.

'It means everything to win again,' said Johnson, who admitted his break was due to issues with alcohol and was competing in just his fifth event on his return. 'It has been a tough road but a lot of good has come out of it and I feel great now. This has to be the best win of my career.'

Johnson has long had a reputation as one of America's most gifted talents but was in danger of throwing it all away. Now he looks a reformed character. The latest world rankings out on Monday are likely to show him up to 6th and he' s quite capable of giving Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the top.

Masters champion Bubba Watson led briefly but paid for a bad stretch of three bogeys in four holes from the 11th and finished third. Johnson went the other way, playing his last 11 holes so artfully that he completed the sequence in a telling three under par.

It was hard not to feel sorry for Holmes. He had opened the tournament with a 62 that was so good it might well stand as the round of the year. But he blew his chances with a terrible start that saw his five shot lead dwindle to nothing before the first 90 minutes of play was completed.

As for McIlroy, his troubles with the plethora of water hazards continued right to the end, as he put not only his drive on the 18th into the water, but his third shot as well.

Before the start of his final round, Donald Trump, preposterous owner of this overrated venue, had presented McIlroy with the three iron he had tossed infamously into the water on Friday, after it was retrieved by a scuba diver.

McIlroy took it out of his bag once on Sunday - to play that third shot at the last. Thanks a lot, Donald, he must have been thinking.

McIlroy shaped up to throw the offending implement into the water once more, but this time kept hold of it. It was a moment of light relief at the end of a seriously trying week for the world number one.

At least he finished off with a more typical example of his artistry. Through the back of the green and staring down the barrel of an ugly triple bogey seven or still worse, McIlroy chipped the ball in for a six.

Even so, it rather undid the good work he displayed earlier, and meant he signed for a 71. He still finished in the top ten, though. All those missed putts and shots into the water, and still only a handful of players beat him.

'It was certainly an adventurous week and the game's just not quite there,' he admitted. 'I'm pretty disappointed with the way I played overall. But there were signs of improvement.'

He will look to build on those during a two day trip to Augusta National, beginning on Monday. He will play just one more tournament – the Arnold Palmer Invitational next week – before his historic tilt at a career grand slam at the Masters next month.

Round of the day came from England's Danny Willett, who shot 68 to finish tied 12th. This was a fine confidence boost for the 27-year-old Yorkshireman ahead of his first appearance at The Masters.

'I'm obviously very pleased,' he said. 'It's a tough course and the set-up is very difficult so to finish on level par for the week, I'd have bitten your hand off if you'd offered me that on Thursday. When you're playing with the top 50 you know they're not going to give you anything, but I'm feeling more comfortable all the time playing at this level.'

How far can he go? One area of concern remains a chronic back injury that has caused him to withdraw from plenty of tournaments over the years and one this year already. 'I'm taking painkillers and managing it,' he said. 'I'm going to stay over here through the Masters because flying back and forth is no good for it. There's no point worrying about it, I've just got to get on with it.'

He is doing that all right.
