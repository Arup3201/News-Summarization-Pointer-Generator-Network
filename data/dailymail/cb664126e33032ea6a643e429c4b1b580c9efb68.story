A pet Labrador survived a 150ft cliff plunge but had to doggy paddle in the sea for 40 minutes before being rescued by a lifeboat.

Spice survived the fall but could not scramble up the steep cliffs at Stackpole, near Pembroke West Wales.

All his horrified owners could do was watch his desperate struggle from the clifftop and hope he could tread water until help arrived.

Luckily Spice kept paddling long enough for the RNLI lifeboat to arrive and the dramatic rescue was caught on video.

The crew also captured the moment Spice was reunited with his tearful owners Tom and Kylie Crowe, both 24, and their 6-month-old daughter Seraphina.

More than a dozen rescuers battled to save a stranded Labrador forced to doggy-paddle in choppy seas after falling 150ft from a cliff

Spice was being taken for a walk along a cliff path when he ran over the edge and plummeted into the water below.

Mr Crowe, a construction manager from 
Lincoln who is on holiday in the area this week, said he and his family watched helplessly as the lifeboat crew 
made a nine-mile dash in the nick of time.

He said: 'Spice was running along the clifftop when he suddenly disappeared over the horizon and I heard someone shout that there was a dog in the water.

'I could see him swimming but he was in the sea for 40 minutes before he was picked up.

'But he's running around on the beach now like nothing happened.'

The lifeboat arrived at the dark cove, where chocolate Labrador Spice was floundering in the water.

An RNLI spokesman said: 'He was frightened and getting tired after spending so long swimming.

'Two of the crew climbed into a small inflatable boat to reach him but he wasn't too sure to start with.

'In the end one of the crew jumped into the water to grab hold of the dog and help himÂ  onto the boat.'

The dramatic rescue, involving Tenby lifeboat and a local cliff rescue team was captured on a heartwarming video.

Spice was checked over by a vet but had not suffered any injuries in the cliff fall.

The RNLI spokesman said: 'He's a tough dog - he survived the cliff fall and 40 minutes in the cold choppy sea.

'His tail wouldn't stop wagging when we took him back to his relieved owners.'
