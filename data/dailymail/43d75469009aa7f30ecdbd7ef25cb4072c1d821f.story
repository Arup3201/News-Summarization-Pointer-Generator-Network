A police officer in the Mexican city of Tijuana has built up a cult following after impressing drivers and pedestrians alike with his dance moves while he directs the traffic.

Jose Ruben Echeverria showed he has the moves like Jacko on Sunday as he danced to the King Of Pop’s classic Billie Jean while keeping the busy city streets moving.

The dancing traffic controller is quite a sight to behold as he incorporates several of Jackson’s trademark moves such as gyrating his hips and Moonwalking along with all important hand gestures to ensure that the traffic and pedestrians continue to flow as they should.

Echeverria says he dances so that the experience of being stuck in traffic jams is more pleasant for motorists and pedestrians. 

He also believes it can help boost people's mood and improve their attitude.

‘You see them, wanting to cross, to get through, and so you need to look for a way to make that moment pleasant for them while they are stuck there, so when they finally make it [through] they can continue with a different attitude,’ he told Ruptly TV.

But Echeverria has to be careful he doesn't become too much of a distraction as on Sunday he attracted numerous bystanders desperate to have photo taken with the dancing police officer.
