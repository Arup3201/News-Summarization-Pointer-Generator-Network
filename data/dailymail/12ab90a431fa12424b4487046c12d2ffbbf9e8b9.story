He often raised eyebrows with his flamboyant costume choices on the ice - and now former figure skater Johnny Weir is bringing that same flair to his new job off the ice.

The 29-year-old former Olympian has wowed NBC viewers with his eye-catching ensembles while working as a commentator in Sochi alongside fellow former skater and close friend Tara Lipinski.

Weir, a three-time US champion, two-time Olympian and World medalist, has fast garnered fans for his clear commentary and mammoth accessories.

And while admiring his bold jewelry choices, fans have also taken to Twitter to applaud Weir, who came out as gay in 2011, for standing out amid Russia's controversial anti-gay laws.

'Johnny Weir's outfit for gold medal,' one wrote while another added: 'Former figure skater/current commentator Johnny Weir is actively taunting Putin w/ his fabulous shirt & gold chains today.'

'REMINDER,' another added. 'You'll never be as fabulous as Johnny Weir.'

So far he has donned sharp fitted suits, leather pants, sheer tops, ruffled shirts and gold chains finished with a perfectly curled quiff or a braid across his head.

And despite receiving a barrage of threats from animal rights activists for wearing fur on his costume during the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, he again opted for a large fur coat to battle Russia's cold.

Before going on air, he has shared his looks with his thousands of followers on his Instagram page.

He particularly caught viewers' eyes with a statement necklace and a hefty jeweled ring during commentary at the weekend.

'Much respect for Johnny Weir rocking the Grandma’s Bingo Night necklace,' Twitter user Chris Gorski quipped.

'How insanely jealous do you think Kanye is of Johnny Weir's necklace right now, though,' another added.

Before heading to the Olympics, Weir spoke about how he was looking forward to taking his personal style with him to Russia for his NBC gig.

'NBC has been asking me since Vancouver to
 be a part of their team, and those conversations have been very open,' he told Philadelphia Magazine. 
'They’ve understood that I’m clever, I’m very flamboyant, I have a crazy 
dress sense.'

He added that he would be taking inspiration from unexpected places for his on-air wardrobe.

'I 
decided to go more of Stanley Tucci’s character from The Hunger Games,' he told the magazine.

'I'm trying to stay between the lines of Johnny on Skating with the Stars
 and the rest of the NBC men’s family in Brooks Brothers.'

And
 his co-commentator, Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski, told NBC on 
Monday morning that they're enjoying playing dress up together.

'We share adjoining rooms so there's lots of fashion fun,' she said.

Weir came out as gay in 2011 and on New Year's Eve that year, he married boyfriend Victor Voronov.

Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired to be in a relationship with'.

He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind.

'He's
 wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my 
razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually 
do.'

The figure skater 
officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World. He cited a
 recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his 
sexuality.

'In the last 
couple years, with so many people having trouble and me being in the 
spotlight more than ever in my life, I realised that I am proud,' Weir 
told OnTheRedCarpet.com.

Speaking
 to IceNetwork.com, he added: 'I'm very happy with my personal life and 
also my professional life, and I thank God I can be exactly where I'm 
at.'
