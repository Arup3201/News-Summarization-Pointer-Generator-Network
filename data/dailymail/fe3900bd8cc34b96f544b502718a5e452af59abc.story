A Colombian fisherman has miraculously survived spending two nights in the open ocean by clinging to a Styrofoam icebox after his boat capsized.

Solano Salazar, 47, and a friend set sail from the town of Lopez in the south of the country on Friday,  but two days later strong winds caused their vessel to overturn 21 miles from the coast.

After the men and their possessions were thrown into the water, Mr Salazar grabbed the nearest buoyant object he could find - clinging on to the icebox for 48 hours until the crew of a passing Colombian naval vessel chanced upon him while carrying out drills in the remote stretch of ocean.

Incredible video footage released by the Colombian Navy captures the exact moment sailors spotted Mr Salazar floating in the open ocean tied to the buoyant icebox.

They were able to manoeuvre their warship towards him before a diver jumped overboard and pulled the stricken fisherman to safety.

Mr Salazar was rushed back to short and taken to hospital, but despite his near-death ordeal, was found to be suffering from nothing but dehydration. He is expected to make a full recovery. 

Rescue teams are continuing to scour the area for Mr Salazar's fishing companion, but the man is still missing and feared dead. His name has not yet been released.

Describing his ordeal, Mr Salazar said: ''I am OK now because the navy rescued me. I thought I was going to die. I didn't think about anything else.'

He added that he feels much better now he is back on dry land.

As well as incredible coincidence of a naval vessel happening to pass through the remote stretch of ocean and spotting him, Mr Salazar was also fortunate that shortly after the winds overturned his fishing boat, the weather became relatively calm, ensuring he wasn't drowned by massive waves.

Speaking of the rescue effort, the commander of Colombia's Pacific coast guard, Captain Andres Mejia, said: 'The person was rescued and taken to the Malaga hospital. He was given first aid.'

'He was dehydrated and according to what he said, they left on Friday from the Guapi area to fish with another person and they were turned over in bad weather,' he added.
