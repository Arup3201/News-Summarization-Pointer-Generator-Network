A 16-year-old girl has committed suicide after posting a farewell video to YouTube.

Maddie Yates, from Louisville, Kentucky, uploaded the video entitled 'Important' online and then shared it on her Twitter page before taking her life on Monday night.

The video, which has now been taken down, was viewed more than 10,000 times in the first 24 hours after it was posted, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.

'I know that I'm going to hurt everyone who loves me,' she said, explaining that she had been treated for depression and had been prescribed Prozac.

Final message: Maddie Yates is pictured in a YouTube video she posted entitled 'Important' before she took her life on Monday. The video, which was viewed thousands of times, has now been removed

'But I've been like this for so long, and thereâ€™s still a 
chance that the worst day might still be coming. And I just donâ€™t see 
how this is a bad idea.'

She continued: 'I don't want anyone to feel like it was their
 fault. This was my decision, not yours. Iâ€™m the one who messed up, not 
you. There's nothing, literally nothing that you could have done.'

She added that she had seen no other option than to take her life because 'I am not a good person'.

'You don't even want to know the things that I think... I'm doing literally the whole world a favor. But I love 
you, and I'm sorry. And I really, really love you,' she said.

There are few further details about the circumstances of her death, but her mother confirmed it on Facebook, saying that moments before her death, her daughter had had the family laughing.

'I want you all to know the this was the worse thing she could have done,' she said, as she urged others to seek help if they felt suicidal.

Loss: She said she had been treated for depression and feared that she had not yet seen the worst

Maddie herself had previously tweeted, 'The fact that suicide is an actual option for some people is what really breaks my heart,' and was planning to take part in a fundraising walk for suicide prevention in memory of a friend who passed away nearly one year before Maddie.

Last year, she added on Twitter: 'If people who killed themselves could just see how everyone loved them, then maybe they'd take back what they did. But they can't.'

Her three-minute video was taken down from YouTube - but by that point it had already been shared by school friends at Louisville Male High School, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.

Before it was removed, Jefferson County Public Schools blocked access to YouTube and Twitter throughout the district in a bid to protect students.

Accomplished: Louisville Male High School school paid tribute to Maddie, calling her an 'exceptional student'

'This was an effort to ensure that students who are emotionally impacted could get the help they needed as we worked with officials to address the situation through the most appropriate and efficient channels,' the district said in a statement.

But at least one student's father disagreed with the decision, saying that 'trying to ignore what happened isn't going to help anyone'.

Male High School also provided 20 grief counselors for students to meet and speak with.

'Male High's thoughts and prayers go out to the Yates' family,' the school tweeted. 'Maddie was an exceptional student and will be missed dearly. #MaleHigh'

Her friends have also been sharing tributes online.

Yates added that she had seen no other option than to take her life because 'I am not a good person'

'Anyone who knew Maddie knew she always 
had the biggest smile on her face!' one wrote. 'Always laughing and giggling. Such a 
sweet soul, gone too soon.'

'No Maddie it wasn't a favor at all,' another friend said in response to her video. 'You meant the absolute world to me.'
