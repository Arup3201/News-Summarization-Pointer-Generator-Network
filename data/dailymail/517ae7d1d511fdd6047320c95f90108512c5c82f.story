Betting man: Reclusive long-term gambler Nick Newlife bequeathed his adventurous Federer bet to Oxfam before he died in 2009

A tennis fan who predicted Roger Federer's record-equaling Wimbledon triumph almost a decade ago has helped win Oxfam £100,000.

Nick Newlife placed an adventurous £1,520 wager in 2003 on the Swiss maestro to win Wimbledon seven times by 2019, at odds of 66-1.

Mr Newlife, who died three years ago, bequeathed the betting slip to the charity in his will, with Oxfam bosses watching in delight as the bold gamble yesterday won them the six-figure sum.

After Mr Newlife passed away in 2009 aged 69, Oxfam narrowly missed out on the prize money when Federer crashed out at SW19 last year.

Andy Murray's misery at the All England Club has become Oxfam's joy, however, as the ticket will now see them handed a £101,840 donation.

Mr Newlife, of Tackley, Oxon., died in 2009 with no family and friends and left his worldly belongings to the Oxfam charity - including the betting slip.

He was a recluse and asked neighbours to place bets for him because he was convinced bookies had worked out his system.

The bearded bachelor was a landlord who lived alone in a three bedroomed semi-detached house set in a picture postcard countryside village.

Neighbour at the time Gavin Cowan, 56, said: 'Mr Newlife came to me and got me to help him install a computer - he said he wanted to place a series of long-term bets.

'He said that it was all going to charity. At the time he was tipping Lewis Hamilton to become a world champion before he had become a big star.

'Nick said he had made predictions about several people over the years and wanted me to lay some of his bets.

William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said: 'This is a unique situation in my 40-year experience of the bookmaking world.

'Mr Newlife's bet could land six-figure winnings from beyond the grave, and in sporting terms Roger Federer came back from the dead to keep the dream alive for Oxfam and all his fans.'

Oxfam spokesman Stuart Fowkes said: 'Legacies amount to 10 per cent of our total income from individuals, so they're essential to us, and as this case proves they can come in all shapes and sizes.'

Mr Newlife, a recluse who rarely washed or left his home, got friends to place his bets for him as he was 'convinced bookies had worked out his system'
