As the leadership challenge in recent days has caused speculation on whether Malcolm Turnbull will soon hold the top job, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and partner David Panton showed what appeared to be a united front when they met up with the potentially new Prime Minister.

The couple were seen leaving Sydney Airport on Sunday morning and later arrived with the Communications Minister at a Liberal Party fundraiser in Woollahra, eastern Sydney.

The trio appeared relaxed until Mr Panton became caught up in the media scrum at the event which prompted Mr Turnbull to shout 'where's David' before reaching out to save him.

This came just hours after Prime Minister Tony Abbott moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out of the leadership challenge.

Ms Bishop was first seen with Mr Panton at the Melbourne Cup in November but after admitting they were an item, she later turned around and denied it.

The Foreign Minister said she and Mr Panton were 'just friends', trying to end suggestions that she and the businessman were in a relationship.

But since then, the couple - who've been dating for about 10 months - have attended events together including the Portsea Polo near Melbourne last month.  

Intensely private when it comes to her personal life, Ms Bishop, who was married to Perth property developer Neil Gillon from 1983 to 1988 revealed Mr Panton is 'supportive'.

But she said she doesn't include him in any of her day-to-day work, saying, 'I don’t expect other people to get involved in my job but it’s nice to have support.'

After divorcing her husband in 1988 she dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years before stepping out with Mr Panton.

The couple's attendance at this morning's fundraiser with Mr Turnbull comes as Mr Abbott has moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday.

This was shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out a leadership challenge.

Businessman David Panton was previously married to his wife Karen.

Together they set up Panton Vineyard in the resort town of Shoreham just outside Melbourne, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

They had three children: Sally, Laura and Matthew.

Mr Panton's two daughters accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival last year, where he made his first appearance with Julie Bishop.

A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham. 

Mr Panton's son Matthew lives in New York.

'The last thing that Australia needs right now is instability and uncertainty,' Mr Abbott said in a brief press conference held on Sunday morning.

Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them.

'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said.

'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.'

Mr Abbott asked the Chief Government Whip, Philip Ruddock, to call a special Party Room meeting for 9am on Monday February 9 to consider the spill motion.

'It is important to end the uncertainty at the very beginning of the parliamentary sitting week,' he said.

'The normal Party Room meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning will also go ahead in the usual way.'

Tony Abbott has moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday
