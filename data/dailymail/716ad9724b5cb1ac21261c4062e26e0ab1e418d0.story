A top university official ran up a £45,000 expenses bill in just 14 months, it has emerged. 

Sheila O'Neal, executive director of development at Bangor University, spent the money on flights, hotels and meals - including a £10,000 trip to New York for herself and three colleagues.

During the trip last March, the group watched Emma Thompson and Bryn Terfel on Broadway in the  Stephen Sondheim production production of Sweeney Todd.

Ms O'Neal, who took up her post in the autumn of 2013, also spent more than £1,000 on taxis, £5,400 on food and £14,000 on hotels between October 2013 and December 2014.

The figures were obtained by S4C’s current affairs programme Y Byd ar Bedwar. 

The university defended the New York visit, saying it was necessary in order to raise funds for future developments.

Ms O'Neal, 60, was joined on the trip by vice-chancellor Professor John Hughes and his wife, Dr Xinyu Wu, the university's director of international development. 

Elen ap Robert, artistic director of Pontio, the university's new arts centre, was also invited.

The centre will include a 450-seat theatre named after Terfel, who has an honourary doctorate from the institution.

Work on Pontio is currently running months behind schedule with the £49 million project already £12 million over budget.

Terfel has previously defended the delay saying they needed 'time to get everything perfect'.

Plaid Cymru's education spokesman Simon Thomas said: 'I understand that this trip was involved with Pontio.

'I would think that their resources would be better spent making sure the building work is finished on time instead of flying out to New York.'

The president of Bangor's students' union, Rhys Taylor, said: 'I don't think there was any need to send staff over to New York for this trip.

'I think it's important that these decisions are discussed more openly with the rest of the university, including students and members of staff.'   

A university spokesman said the trip was necessary to raise more funds for the university and added it had generated £2.2 million since Mrs O'Neal took her post. 

Ms O'Neal has received a 'reminder' over her expenses bill ran-up between October 2013 and December 2014.

A spokesman told S4C's Y Byd ar Bedwar ('The World on Four') program: 'The university has succeeded in raising £2.2m since Ms O'Neal took up her post in autumn 2013.

'Expenses connected to this job are higher than other roles within the university however, this is because it is pursuing an ambitious fundraising programme.

'We encourage our staff to get the best possible price for any item of expenditure and Ms O'Neal has been reminded of this recently.

'It is not possible to put a specific figure on how much has been raised individually by Ms O'Neal. And it is difficult to attach any single donation to a single event or visit.

'We are continuing to keep in touch with individuals following the visit to New York to secure future donations'.
