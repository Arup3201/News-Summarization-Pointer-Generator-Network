A disgusted NFL player ripped his team's hometown fans after they cheered loudly while his quarterback was injured on the field.

The fan response came as Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel was knocked out of the game on Sunday by a Baltimore Ravens defender about 100 pounds heavier, causing him to suffer a head injury.

Cassel sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter hit, and had to be helped off the field before the Chiefs ultimately lost 9-6.

Brutality: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel is surrounded by trainers and teammates after he suffered a head injury against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday

Enraged: After the game, Eric Winston ripped Kansas City Chiefs fans for cheering while Cassel was sidelined

Instead of showing concern for the fallen QB, a section of fans - who blame Cassel for the team’s woeful 1-4 start - cheered. The response enraged Cassel’s teammates.

Among them was offensive tackle Eric 
Winston, who lambasted fans as reporters surrounded him in the locker 
room after the game.

He told reporters: 'I think it's 
sickening and disgusting. We are not gladiators and this is not the 
Roman Colosseum. This is a game. This is a game that's going to cost us a
lot down the road. That's OK. We picked it.

‘We deserve it. I don't want your pity. But we've got a lot of problems as a society if people think that's OK.'

On Monday, Winston stood by his remarks the day before, and added: 'It might have been 7,000, might have been 700, but it was still too many. I was directing those comments at a few people, and when I say a few people, I do mean a few people, because I don't think it was the majority of people or even the vast minority of people.'

Even the Ravens 330-pound defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, who issued the punishing blow on Cassel, thought the fan reaction was uncalled for.

Ngata told ESPN: 'For them to cheer for him being hurt, that's just not cool.'

Ngata added: 'Hopefully, he bounces back and gets better.'

Prior to the game some fans paid for a plane to hover over Arrowhead Stadium, towing a banner that pleaded for Cassel to be benched and for Chiefs GM Scott Pioli to be fired.

Due to his injury, Cassel is likely to be sidelined for at least next weekend's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Chiefs coach Romeo Crennel did not rule out Cassel's return to the field this week, but said the team is putting safety first.

Crennel
said: 'Some individuals recover faster than others, but with the 
emphasis on concussions in the league, they're making sure we do due 
diligence with the player's health, making sure he's not rushed back, so
we'll see.'

The fans' blasé attitude to Cassel's 
concussion fails to take into consideration the seriousness of head 
injuries - and their fatal effects - in the NFL.

Several players in recent years, including Tennessee Titan O.J. Murdock and Atlanta Falcons' Ray Easterling, have committed suicide months or years after suffering head injuries.

In another indication that blows to 
the head may cause serious trouble, a study in September discovered that
football players are three times more likely to die from degenerative 
brain disease.

The death rate from Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease combined was about three times of 
that for the general U.S. population, researchers from the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported.

The fans' blasé attitude to Cassel's concussion fails to take into consideration the seriousness of head injuries - and their fatal effects - in the NFL.

In the past two years, the suicides of six NFL players have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated blows to the head.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion 
and depression which may appear within months or many 
decades later. Later in life it can eventually cause dementia.

Experts believe CTE may be caused by the loss of neurons and scarring of
brain tissue among other injuries caused by repeated concussion.

It changes brain cells' cytoskeletons, which is thought to be due to 
damage to cerebral blood vessels. The condition is virtually 
indistinguishable from Alzheimer’s.

Players who have committed suicide in recent years, with possible links to the condition, include:

Dave Duerson: Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for CTE.

Wade Belak: Former Nashville Predator Wade Belak was found dead in September 2011, having hanged himself in a Toronto hotel room.

Junior Seau: In May 2012 Junior Seau, of the San Diego Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was found by his girlfriend at his home in California.

Kurt Crain: The South Alabama associate head football coach, who once played in the NFL, shot himself in April 2012. He had had reportedly been suffering from a severe prostate infection.

Ray Easterling: Also in April Ray Easterling, a one-time Atlanta Falcons star, shot himself at home after struggling to cope with dementia.

O.J. Murdock: In July, the 25-year-old Tennessee Titans wide receiver fatally shot himself while sitting in his car after texting his coach to apologise.
