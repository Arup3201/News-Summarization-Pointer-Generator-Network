One member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot has had her conviction overturned in an appeal court in Moscow today.

Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, will be released immediately whilst Nadezdha Tolonnikova, 22, and Maria Alyokhina, 24, remain in custody.

Judges at Moscow City Court ruled that as Ms Samutsevich had been thrown out of the cathedral before she was able to get her guitar out of its case, she was innocent.

The
three women were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred
in August this year after they performed a ‘punk prayer’ in the Russian
capital’s main Orthodox cathedral imploring the Virgin Mary to rid 
Russia of Putin.

Earlier Ms Tolonnikova had pleaded with the judges to have all their two-year sentences overturned.

Speaking from inside their glass 
cage the mother-of-one said: ‘We cannot admit to charges of religious hatred. Please 
overturn the conviction.’

Pussy
Riot supporters said earlier that the women were 
unlikely to win their appeal against their jail terms Vladimir Putin spoke out against them, saying they got what they deserved.

Smiling again: The judges ruled that as Ms Samutsevich did not get a chance to get her guitar out of its case, she was not guilty of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred

Released: As Samutsevich get in a car with her relatives, she can look forward to freedom whilst the other two members will serve their sentence at a penal colony

Relatives and lawyers for the trio 
complained of political interference, saying that
Putin's comments on the case in an interview marking his 60th 
birthday this weekend, had compromised the appeal.

In the interview, which aired on Sunday, 
President Putin defended the sentence.

He said: ‘It is right that they were arrested
and it was right that the court took this decision because you cannot 
undermine the fundamental morals and values to destroy the country’.

Despite
support from Western governments including the U.S. president Barack 
Obama, and superstars like Madonna and Sting condemning the sentences, a poll showed that a majority of Russians agree with President Putin.

An 
opinion poll conducted by the independent Levada 
centre found 35 per cent of Russians believe the two-year sentences were 
appropriate, while 34 per cent said they were too lenient and only 14 
per cent said they were excessive.

The
three women were brought to Moscow City Court and led into a metal and 
plexiglass cage where they sat facing a three-judge panel and stood to 
answer introductory questions from the senior judge.

The other two members cheered and 
hugged their band-mate as the three-judge panel announced that Ms 
Samutsevich's sentence was suspended.

Kremlin opponents have said the jail terms 
were part of a clampdown on dissent that has produced restrictive laws 
and criminal cases against critics of Putin since he began his six-year 
term in May.

Appeal: The three members of punk-rock band Pussy Riot sit in a glass-walled cage in the court room before the beginning of the hearing at the Moscow City Court this morning

But sympathy 
for Pussy Riot is limited in Russia, where Patriarch Kirill has cast the
protest as part of an attack meant to curb the church's post-Soviet 
revival in a nation where most people are Russian Orthodox.

Parliament
is considering legislation stiffening punishment for offending 
religious feelings and Putin has warned that such offences - against 
Christians, Muslims or other believers in diverse Russia - could incite 
violence.

Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev said last month that they have already served enough 
time, while the Russian Orthodox Church has said they should repent if 
they want forgiveness.

The
appeal hearing in the Moscow City Court began on October 1 but was 
quickly adjourned after Samutsevich dismissed her lawyers, citing 
unspecified differences of opinion on the case.

Crime: The trio were convicted in August for of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred or hostility after singing an anti-Putin song in the Christ the Savior cathedral in Moscow
