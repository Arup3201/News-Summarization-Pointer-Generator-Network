Paris Hilton has become the target of anti-Semitic taunts and death threats from a crazed stalker who seems to believe the hotel heiress and her family are Jewish.

The 33-year-old - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton have both been targeted on Instagram and Facebook by a man who has posted several abusive messages to the pair.

According to TMZ, one of the posts he allegedly wrote read: 'I know ur Jew family gives nothing,' and another stated: 'KILL JEWS FOR FUN (sic)'

A post to Rick said: 'one month and she's dead, she's never coming home. (sic)'

Another message to Rick read: 'I'll beat u and that bitch to unconscious.(sic)'

The man is also alleged to have threatened to sexually assault the 33-year-old star.

The Los Angeles Police Department has obtained a warrant to try to track down the man on the social media sites and believe they know who he is.

This is not the first time Paris has been hit with death threats. In May 2007, the hotel heiress was sentenced to a 45-day jail term and before the stretch was due to start in June that year she was said to be inundated with threats from inmates.

An insider said at the time: 'These maniacs have been writing, "We're going to get you," and, "I'm going to kill you." It's horrifying.

'One person wrote that she's going to steal Paris' shoes when she gets to jail--and if Paris argues, she'll be beaten to a pulp.'

Paris said: 'I'm very scared right now.'
