This is the shocking moment a man suffering from Ebola was bundled into the back of an ambulance after he caused mass panic at a market in Liberia when he wandered in looking for food.

The unidentified man walked into a market in the capital Monrovia - which has been badly hit by the worst ever outbreak of the disease -  only to be chased from the area by panicked shoppers.

Attempting to make off with loaves of bread, the man is then chased down the road by men wearing yellow protection suits, who eventually catch  him and bundle him into the back of a UNICEF vehicle.

Fear: The hungry Ebola patient (red shirt) wandered into the market to get food, causing shoppers to panic

Threat: The unidentified man walked into a market in the capital Monrovia - which has been badly hit by the worst ever outbreak of the disease - in order to find something to eat

By
 any means necessary: With locals panicking at the thought of a highly 
contagious Ebola patient on the loose, the health workers use force to 
bundle him into the UNICEF vehicle

The footage
 emerged as it was revealed that food in countries hit by the West 
African Ebola outbreak is becoming increasingly expensive and difficult 
to find, as farmers are barred from accessing their fields in order to 
prevent the disease spreading, a UN food agency has warned.

The
 world's worst-ever Ebola outbreak has so far killed more than 1,500 
people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Guinea - where it is 
believed to have first developed. 

Surrounding countries have closed land borders, many airlines have suspended flights to and from the affected countries and seaports are seeing less traffic, restricting food imports to the hardest-hit countries.

Those countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - all rely on grain from abroad to feed their people, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Taking no chances: The heavily protected health workers eventually catch up with the runaway Ebola patient

In one market in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, the price of cassava root, a staple in many West African diets, was up 150%.

'Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80% of their incomes on food,' said Vincent Martin, who is co-ordinating the agency's response to the crisis.

'Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach.'

The UN has said 1.3 million people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will need help feeding themselves in coming months.

The situation looks likely worsen, FAO said, because restrictions on movement are preventing labourers from accessing farms, and the harvest of rice and corn is set to begin in a few weeks.

Unconvinced: The man seems unwilling to leave the area with the medics and starts trying to escape

 Force: Unwilling to leave the market the man is bundled into the back of the back of the ambulance by medics

Stopped: The health workers eventually manage to get the patient into the back of the vehicle before driving off

The World Health Organisation is asking countries to lift border closures because they are preventing supplies from reaching people in desperate need.

Ivory Coast decided last night to keep its borders with Guinea and Liberia closed but said it would open a humanitarian corridor to allow supplies in.

The news comes as Ivory Coast's football association said it will host the country's African Nations Cup qualifier against Sierra Leone this weekend following a special national security council meeting.

The decision, announced in a government statement published in local media today, comes one week after the government said it would not allow the match to go ahead, citing health concerns.

As of August 29, the World Health Organization had confirmed 935 cases of the deadly virus in Sierra Leone - including 380 deaths - though that number is likely to have since risen.

Anger: Furious Monrovia residents chase the vehicle down the road as a warning to the man not to return

With the Ebola death toll continuing to rise in West Africa, new details emerged of next week's first human trial for virus vaccine.

So far the most effective treatment for Ebola appears to have been the experimental drug ZMapp, but this is designed to treat an existing infection, not prevent one.

The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health is working with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline to develop the drug, which is said to have 'performed extremely well' in primate studies.

The first human studies will take place in Maryland next week and involve 20 human subjects aged between 18 and 50, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The subjects will not actually be infected with Ebola. The vaccine will simply be given to them in order to see if it stimulates the appropriate response from their immune system and to test for side-effects.
