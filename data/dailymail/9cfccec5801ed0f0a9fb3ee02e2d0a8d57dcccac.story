Claire Richards has famously battled with her weight over the years, yo-yoying between size 10 and size 20. But at size 16, she is finally feeling body confident.

Now, the former Steps starlet has designed her own plus-size clothing line, keen to prove that fuller-figured women can look and feel both fabulous and fashionable.

Speaking about her new range for plus-size clothing e-tailer Fashion World, she said: 'I'm really excited about my first collection. When designing the range I've tried to create pieces that address all the areas where people might feel a little bit uncomfortable.

Former Steps star Claire Richards has designed her own clothing line for Fashion World. Velour peplum top (£40) and skirt (£30)

The star, size 16, has designed a range of clothes to make fuller-figured women feel body confident (L) Tweed prom dress (£70) and (R) Sequin bodycon dress (£90)

'So you know...a nice sleeve, below the knee, a nip in at the waist.

'I absolutely think it's important for 
plus-size women to have access to on-trend key pieces for their 
wardrobe, I don't see why we should be excluded because we're not what 
is considered the norm in fashion terms.

'I wanted to make sure when 
designing the collection that it wasn't the usual items you get when 
shopping plus-size and that you'll get something a lot trendier than 
usual.'

The 36-year-old's new collection is a mix of conservative but glamorous party dresses, tailored coats and casual tops and jeans, as well as fringed boots and Mary Jane court shoes.

Speaking about her long navy coat, she 
said: 'I love this coat because it's really flattering, and gives you a 
great shape. It's got lots of nice little details and the colour is nice
and vibrant.'

Claire has turned designer and loved creating her new range. She based this pretty dress on a vintage piece she owns. Bird print dress (£50)

Speaking about her Maxi PU Trim Coat (£89), she said: 'I love this coat because it's really flattering, and gives you a great shape'

The palette is fairly neutral with a lot of flattering black and grey shades and the odd pop of colour in the form of a floral pink dress.

As well as casual daytime looks, Claire has added some serious glamour to her range: dresses are embellished with sequins, sparkles and lace, making them perfect for the party season.

She said: 'a great figure-hugging dress with the added bonus of sequins can't fail to win in my eyes' for a night on the town.

Claire has included casual daytime attire as well as more formal dresses with pops of colour and on-trend florals (L) Lurex jumper (£40) and high-waisted skinny jean (£40), (R) Print illusion dress (£80)

Claire has made sure that her clothes conceal women's problem areas. Stud Slouchy Jersey Top (£30) Fringe boot (£75)

The mother-of-two explained how she used a lot of floaty fabric in her range saying: 'It's not see-through so you don't have to worry about showing anything you don't want to,

'It's really comfortable; it's got a good stretch to it so it doesn't feel too tight.'

Long dresses are covered too - Claire said of them: 'You can't beat a gorgeous maxi dress for something that is cool and fashionable.

Claire has publicly battled with her weight but is finally content with her size 16 figure. Tweed prom dress (£70)

Claire looks great in her new campaign for Fashion World, an online fashion retailer for which she is an ambassador. Mary Jane court shoe (£40)

She also revealed that she relies on support underwear to make her feel good in her clothes.

'If you're concerned about lumps and bumps it just takes that worry away for me,' she added.

Rivkie Baum, editor of plus-size magazine SLiNK, is most impressed with Claire's offering.

She said: 'We're loving the new Claire Richards for Fashion World line.

'There are some fantastic party dresses for the Christmas season. There's a great fusion between flattering silhouettes and on trend styles ensuring plus-size women can be just as stylish this Autumn/Winter.'
