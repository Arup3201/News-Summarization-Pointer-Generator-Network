More than 260 aircraft have been involved in 'near misses' in the skies above Britain in recent months, it can be revealed.

Of these, 32 incidents involved airliners, including eight cases when both aircraft were commercial passenger planes.

The 'scheduled passenger' flights included 'jumbo' jet B747s, Airbus A320s and a Boeing 737 - some of the most common planes used by holidaymakers.

Details of the near misses have emerged following the terrifying near miss between two passenger planes at Barcelona Airport.

'Worst experience ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway

The aircraft was forced to abort its landing after the first plane pulled out onto its landing tarmac

'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to pull up and go around the other plane crossing its landing runway

One of the 32 near misses fell into the most serious risk category - defined as 'aircraft proximity in which serious risk of collision has existed'.

The 'A' rated near miss involved an Airbus A319 and powered hang-glider and happened just after 8.30am on July 18, last year around 2,000ft above London.

When a 'near miss' is being assessed, investigators distinguish its seriousness based not on the distance between the two aircraft, but the level of risk involved. This judgement is made based on actual events - not on what could or could not have happened had the aircraft collided.

There are five categories of descending seriousness.

1. Risk of Collision: Aircraft proximity where there has been a serious risk of collision.

2. Safety not assured: Aircraft proximity in which the aircraft may have been unsafe.

3. No risk of collision: Aircraft proximity in which there was no risk of collision.

4. Risk not determined: Aircraft proximity in which insufficient information was available to determine the risk, or there was inconclusive or conflicting evidence preventing a risk assessment.

5. Met the criteria for reporting but it was decided that normal procedures, safety standards and parameters were used.

The figures can be revealed following video footage emerging of a near miss between two planes at Barcelona airport.

The terrifying footage shows a plane pulling out to 'taxi' across a runway while another plane, still airborne, descends towards the tarmac.

Footage shows the plane which had been cleared to land pulling off an emergency 'go-around procedure' to avoid what could have been a fatal collision.

Near misses - known as Air Proximity Hazards or Airprox - are recorded in British airspace by the UK Airprox Board, a body funded by the Civil and Military aviation authorities.

Analysis of its data reveals that between January 2013 and May this year, there were 262 Airprox.

More than 80 of these incidents involved military aircraft, while at least five police helicopters had near misses.

Other aircraft involved in Airprox over the period include private jets, cargo planes and gliders as well as some being used for training flights.

Incidents have also been recorded by the board over the 17 months at altitudes of up to 34,000ft.

An Airprox is a situation where a pilot or air traffic services deem the distance between aircraft, as well as their relative positions and speed, may have compromised their safety.
