A key element to attending any football game is getting to the stadium hours in advance to grill food and drink beer in the parking lot. But anyone attending the Super Bowl in New Jersey next year will have to go without the traditional, pre-game festivities - the Super Bowl Committee announced today that there will be no tailgating allowed at this year's big game.

'You will be allowed to have food in your car and have drink in your 
car,' committee Chairman Al Kelly said at a news conference on Monday. 'And provided you're in the boundaries of a single 
parking space, you'll be able to eat or drink right next to your car. 
However, you're not going to be able to take out a lounge chair, you're 
not going to be able to take out a grill, and you're not going to be 
able to take up more than one parking space. And it'll all be watched 
very carefully.'

No tailgating for you: The Super Bowl Committee has banned tailgating at next year's Super Bowl in New Jersey

But the tailgating buzzkill isn't the only rule the committee is imposing for the Super Bowl - how fans get to the February 2 game also will be regulated.

The game is expected to draw an estimated 80,000 people. But the stadium will only allow about 13,000 individual parking spaces.

The solution: the committee will charter buses to shuttle fans from nine locations throughout the region to the stadium - at $51 per person. And that's after fans have, in many cases, already shelled out thousands of dollars to attend the game.

No parking: In addition to tailgating restrictions, the stadium will only offer 13,000 parking spots for an estimated 80,000 fans

And don't think about taking a cab or car service to the game - no vehicles will be allowed near the stadium on game day without a parking pass.

'Nobody's going to be dropped off by black car,' Kelly said. 'You can 
have a black car, a green car, a white car, a red car as long as you 
have parking, and the car needs to stay on the premises the entire 
time.'

So maybe you'll just park further from the stadium and walk, right? Wrong.

'You cannot walk to the Super Bowl,' Kelly said. 'You can get your hotel to drop you off at one of the New Jersey Transit locations or get the shuttle to take you to a Fan Express location, but you cannot walk.'

Kelly said he expects about 75 percent of ticket holders will use public transportation to get to the game, and that the reduced parking capacity is the result of a larger security perimeter needed around the stadium for a game as high-profile as the Super Bowl.

Super Bowl committee Chairman Al Kelly and other organizers have dubbed this year's game the 'public transportation Super Bowl'

Hosting the Super Bowl in the New York City area is a rare occurrence and has required a lot of logistical planning by city, state and league officials regarding both transportation and security. It has been dubbed by organizers as 'the public transportation Super Bowl.'

James Simpson, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of 
Transportation, said 'the department will suspend all construction before
 the week of the game and planned to staff Super Bowl media day and game
 day at the same level it does for a weather emergency' with the goal of keeping traffic on highways and bridges moving smoothly.

A February blizzard - which isn't uncommon in the northeast - could potentially throw that plan off the rails. But it would make for an exciting game.
