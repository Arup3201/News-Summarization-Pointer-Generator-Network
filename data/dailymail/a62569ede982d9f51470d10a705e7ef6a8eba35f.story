A Californian woman who weighs over 650lbs and has been housebound since 2007 has finally caught her first glimpse of life outside four walls again.

Bonnie's confinement began when her beloved mother died, after which she refused to leave the house. Paralyzed with grief when her father then died two years later, she hasn't since left her bed and has relied entirely on her 24-year-old daughter Jamesha to exist.

But in an intervention stunt pulled off by TV life coach Iyanla Vanzant, a construction crew freed her by cutting a hole through her bedroom wall, and Bonnie was wheeled out into the sunshine on a gurney, as shown in a recent episode of Own network's Iyanla: Fix My Life.

Sunlight at last: This is the moment Bonnie (pictured), who had been housebound for seven years, was wheeled out into the fresh air with her daughter and sole caretaker Jamesha, 24, standing by (bottom left)

'Fresh air!' exclaims Bonnie, breaking into wrenching sobs.

'Feel the sun, Miss Bonnie,' returns Iyanla, prompting the overwhelmed woman to open her eyes.

Bonnie, who is wearing a new dress for the big reveal, is greeted with a rapturous applause from her collective neighbors, and tears from her daughter and full-time caretaker, Jamesha.

Grief: Bonnie's confinement began when her beloved mother died seven years ago, followed by her father two years later - a loss that saw her spiral into a depression and gain an enormous amount of weight

'I'm sorry everybody, I'm sorry!' Bonnie repeats, near-hysterical.

'No sorry!' Iyanla enthuses. 'Thank you. She says "Thank you" everybody.'

After an emotional bear hug with her young grandson, in which she can be heard whispering, 'I told you I was going to take you outside', Bonnie is ready to be taken to hospital in an ambulance for a full evaluation.

Relief: Bonnie's daughter Jamesha (pictured) has been looking after her bed-bound mother, who can't even walk, full-time for five years

Prisoner: Bonnie (seen in a previous episode of the show) has been on a diet and undergoing physical therapy at a care home since she left her house, where she has lost about 75lbs and stood up for the first time

'Step one: done!' cheers Iyanla, clutching a box of much-needed tissues and offering Bonnie a high five.

Bonnie was admitted to the USC Hospital in California, where she was too heavy for their scales, but was estimated to weigh in at over 650lbs.

Last month, she was moved to Pasadena Meadows Nursing Center, where she underwent physical therapy and was placed on a restrictive diet.

She has so far lost about 75lbs and for the first time in five years, she was able to stand up. Doctors say she should be walking within a month.
