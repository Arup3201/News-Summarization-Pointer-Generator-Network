A Mennonite community in Tennessee is grieving after one of its members - and two of his kids- presumably died in a freak canoe accident on a rain-swollen creek in the southeastern area of the state.

The Cleveland Daily Banner reports the Mennonite and five of his children were tossed into the frigid Canosauga Creek around 4pm Wednesday, when their canoe capsized amidst the fast-moving waters.

Three of the children - and are all under 10 - were reportedly able to swim to the safety of the creek's banks, while their dad and siblings were swept away in the creek's currents.

All six people - the five children and their still-missing father -  reportedly belong to the same Mennonite family from Delano, an unincorporated community in Tennessee's Polk County.

'It's a real shock to the community, and I'm sure the grief that is spreading out among the Mennonites is significant," Polk County Mayor Hoyt Firestone told The Chattanooga Free Times Press.

'It's just one of those freak accidents that you don't plan for. It's just a regrettable situation all over.'

Authorities had yet to identify the concerned family by Friday, although the father was said to be in his 30s.

Flooded: The Canosauga Creek was reportedly flooded by the seven inches of rainfall that had pounded Polk County since Sunday

The family was canoeing along what authorities described as a fast-moving creek, swollen from the seven inches of rain that reportedly deluged Polk County since last Sunday.

Emergency workers reportedly canvassed the creek to no avail, beginning their search early Thursday morning.

The search was reportedly called off on Friday as authorities coped with freezing temperatures and continued snow and rainfall.

Newspaper accounts of the search depict concerned Mennonites slogging along the creek's bank, as rescue workers search for their missing brethren.

A community farm market where Mennonites usually hawk fresh produce had been turned into a staging area for authorities as they continued the hunt.

Polk County is located about 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga. None of the six people who were in the canoe at the time of the accident were reportedly wearing a life preserver at the time it capsized.

Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Co-Chair Dan Hicks had previously said rescuers hoped to find the missing people clinging to trees or fences along the creek, but hope was fading with the cold weather.
