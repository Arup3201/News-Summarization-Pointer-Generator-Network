A shocking video that appears to show three gay men being harassed by New York police officers has sparked outrage in the city.

The three-minute long clip shows a trio of men being shouted at police, before one is allegedly put into a police car and driven away.

The officers and the men exchange a stream of shouts and abuse at each other, apparently prompted by officers accusing one of the group of urinating outside police property.

The 26-year-old victim claims he was assaulted outside of Brooklyn's 79th Police Precinct by officers who made vile homosexual slurs

The trio claim that despite the officer accusing Mr Williams of urinating on a police building, he did not check whether the property had been urinated on.

They claim they were then pepper-sprayed and shoved against a car.

The waiter needed four stitches to a cut on his face, bruised ribs, a black eye, and scrape on his torso, the Village Voice reported.

After the row Williams and his roommates - Tony Maenza and Ben Collins, both 24 - were arrested in what they claimed was a move to conceal the incident.

Maenza videoed a portion of the incident.

Now a complaint has been filed with police and the incident is being investigated NYPD Internal Affairs, the Huffington Post reported.

The alleged attack came after three gay men were attacked in Manhattan hours after demonstrators held a rally in May to protest about the killing of a young man who was murdered because of his sexual orientation.

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that a gay couple, Steven Dixon and Michael Coleman, were walking in SoHo at around 5am Tuesday when two men started hurling anti-gay slurs at them as they walked down Broadway.

The verbal assault soon turned physical as the suspects punched 42-year-old Dixon, causing injuries to his right eye. His 41-year-old boyfriend was also beaten.

Police officers who responded to the call managed to track down the alleged assailants, identified as 32-year-old Fabian Ortiz and 23-year-old Pedro Jimenez. Both men have been charged with felony assault as a hate crime.Â 

Just hours earlier, a 45-year-old gay party promoter, identified as Dan Conatrino, was beaten unconscious on East Fourth Street near Avenue D in West Village.

According to Kelly, prior to the attack, Contarino and Ramon Gornell, 39, shared a pitcher of Sangria at the Yuca Bar, followed by beer and shots at the Boiler Room on East Fourth Street.

But the police commissioner said Gornell became 'enraged' after started shouting anti-gay expletives after learning that his drinking companion was homosexual.

'Initially, the conversation was friendly, with [Gornell] noting that he had family who were gay, but, suddenly, according to victim, the assailant just snapped,' Kelly said.
