As London Fashion Week draws to a close many style-watchers will be compiling a list of trends they want to try.

Although many of the outfits may be a little too outlandish for most of us, one way to attempt a catwalk look is by adopting the hair or beauty trends.

Aside from being more affordable than rebooting your entire wardrobe, it is also an easy way to wear catwalk styles without waiting for the collections to filter into high street stores.

Hairdresser to the stars Andrew Jose shows you how to recreate the hair scene on the LFW catwalk 

Hairdresser Andrew Jose, who counts Louise Redknapp, Jodie Kidd, Burberry model Jamie Campbell Bower and Alanis Morisette among his clients, says that this season has seen a plethora of both classic hair looks as well as new trends worth trying.

'At the beginning of every new season, fashion month tells an intricate story of new ideas, concepts and looks intertwined with a glimpse of some firm favourites. 

 'LFW 2015 has not failed to disappoint, showcasing the very best of the design elite, we have seen some beautiful shows from where this seasons new and eclectic trends will emerge from'

Here he shares some of his top looks from the capital's most fashionable week and tells you how you can achieve them.

WAVES AND WOODSTOCK

Texture and movement played a big part this season. Both Topshop and Matthew Williamson used texture to create very different looks for the shows. 

Topshop created a Highland-inspired look – a matte, windswept style. A messy side parting was teamed with a  scrunched in, blown out look. Simple to recreate, all this look needs is slightly damp hair, a handful of Salon Science Cellumax Foam, £17.00, a light weight, long lasting foam that instantly lifts and adds volume even to fine and fragile hair.

Scrunch in to hair with an upwards movement – flip head upside down and blast with a hair dryer to set the natural movement in the hair. For those with fine, straight hair, use a curling tong in big sections to create a bend in the hair, then once the section of hair has been released, pull the ends of the section outwards to straighten out a curl that is too pronounced. 

Shake out hair with fingers and mist over hair with Lee Stafford 'My Big Fat Texturised hair Super Spray (£9.49 Boots) for a gritty matte finish. 

To recreate the Mathew Williamson Woodstock half ponytail, a bohemian look  perfect for everyday hair, simply set hair in to a centre parting and gently backcomb at the crown .

Gather the top section into a loose half ponytail and simply pin in place by crossing over two Kirby grips or a snag-free band. This will create a face framing halo of hair that looks practically angelic. A quick mist of firm hold hair spray is all it will take to keep this style in place all day.

LOW SLUNG STYLING

Relaxed, low slung hair was seen on the catwalk at House of Holland

Relaxed, low slung hair was the order of the week this season, Markus Lupfer and House of Holland embraced the nape of the neck by creating styles that were as low as you can go.

The low slung ponytails had flattering volume at the crown that framed the face from the front, giving a cheeky rear detail.

Recreate the undone pony from Markus Lupfer, by creating smooth, glossy and healthy hair with a touch of movement. 

Part hair in the centre, apply Salon Science Reglosse Smoothing Serum, £18, to the palms of your hands, rub hands together and smooth through the ends of the hair to take away any frizz. 

The Reglosse Serum contains grape seed extract to help tame and instantly nourish dry, frizzy, uncontrollable hair and smooth unruly flyaways.

Gather hair in to a loose pony at the nape of the neck Using a snag-free band, tie your ponytail but making sure the band is halfway down the hair shaft.

When you get to the final tie, don't pull the hair all the way through but create a loop with the ends of the hair.

Pull a few loose messy face framing strands at the front Create a different take on this trend by simply wrapping a scarf around your neck and over your hair - secure at the front, then pull hair out a little so it creates a faux bob.

TOP TIP: Always use a treatment once a week for the healthiest hair possible but remember to use it after shampoo but before conditioner. Shampoo works to rough up the cuticles, removing any dirt from the hair shaft, this then makes the perfect absorbing environment for the masque to penetrate the cuticle to repair and nourish from within. 

The conditioner then works to shut the cuticle back down again, locking in the goodness leaving the cuticle flat and shining with health. 

The Swiss Apple Salon Science Cellutensive Masque (£19, Boots) is a rejuvenating and anti-ageing cellular treatment containing powerful plant stem cells to protect and improve the hair's health, strength and thickness - and a great quick fix for hair that needs a little bit of love.

CURRENT BUNS AND PONY HYBRIDS

Jonathan Saunders brought back the messy bun coupled with a Sixties vibe. The hair was pulled back as tight as can be, and glossed over with a wet-look gel.

To get this look keep the pulled back hair as flat as possible then fix in to a mid pony between the crown and the nape of the neck. 

Buns and ponytails got a reinvention at Johnathan Saunders (left) and Apu Jan (right)

Backcomb the pony to create volume and smooth over the top with a soft bristled brush to polish out the backcomb on the surface. Wrap the hair around the base of the pony, pinning as you go. Instead of pinning in the end section, leave it to hang below to create a hybrid bun and pony.

Apu Jan also showcased a similar bun, positioned lower down with a bit more texture. To recreate use a texturizing dust on the ponytail and rubbing it into the hair using the palms of the hands, this will create a matt effect with lots more volume before wrapping in to a bun.

TOP TIP: When styling a heavy pronounced centre parting, do bear in mind that a lot of scalp will be on show! Make sure you treat your scalp as you would the skin on your face by lavishing it with lots of tlc. 

Take your haircare cue from skincare by remembering to exfoliate and moisturise. Try the Salon Science Hydrafoliant scalp scrub £15.00, a pre-shampoo scalp treatment containing powerful exfoliants to lift and remove old skin cells for a visibly smoother and clearer scalp. 

Then moisturise with a slick of Salon Science Hyrdrasorb intentsive masque £17.00. An intensive, scalp purifying treatment with ultra-hydrating compounds to restore optimum moisture levels, leaving hair instantly radiating health.

SEVENTIES CRIMP AND GLOSSED-BACK SIDES

This season Preen paid homage to the Seventies with big roller disco inspired hair. Heavily gelled flat centre parting mixed with big fluffed out frizzy waves can be made more wearable by diffusing the look into teased out curls at the sides.

For thick hair, always curl hair the day after washing so it has a little less slip. Mist a heat-protecting spray all over hair such as Salon Science Swiss Grape GSP-T Reprotectant Thermal Crème (£16) which contains a powerful antioxidant complex that binds to the hair's surface for advanced protection.

This protective, conditioning spray prevents damage caused by heated appliances whilst using vitamin E antioxidants and state-of-the-art UV filter systems for protection against daily environmental stress. Then start to tong two-inch sections with a large-barrel curling iron to create lazy waves.

Roll each curl up on your finger and pin to the root - continue all over and mist over with hairspray Let the curls cool and remove the pins - then brush through lightly with your fingers.

TOP TIP: Sleep with hair in one or two plaits depending on how thick your hair is. The next morning you will wake up with instant textured waves - the perfect foundation for tonging and back-combing into mussed up waves

The Julian Macdonald show incorporated a wet-look at the sides by slicking back the sides of each girl's hair with handfuls of hair gel.

Recreate a softer version of this look to cheat out the second or third day hair with no time for a hair wash. Disguise oily roots with this quick get out of bed fix, simply slick through some gel through the top and side sections sections of hair. 

Then roughly pin up the sides criss-crossing the Kirby grips to anchor the hair - this will create a faux hawk shape half up style!
