Britain should ban major Russian tycoons like Roman Abramovich from London, Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe has demanded.

The owner of Chelsea Football Club and his family should be hit by new Western sanctions aimed at hurting the strongman's regime and those who propped it up, claimed Alexei Navalny.

He called for the same curbs on leading Arsenal FC shareholder, Alisher Usmanov, in a bid to force the Kremlin's hand over Ukraine.

These Russian moneymen are seen as close to strongman Putin, but sanctions so far have not hit them directly.

Navalny, released from a short jail sentence in Moscow this week, is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after the brutal murder of fellow Putin foe Boris Nemtsov in the shadow of the Kremlin.

'You can draw up a blacklist of about 1,000 people who will no longer be allowed entry into Western countries, and you can do it quietly, without any big announcement,' the anti-corruption blogger and lawyer told The Financial Times.

Navalny believes that if tycoons such as Abramovich (pictured) can't get to their London residences, it will put pressure on Moscow to pull out of Ukraine

'Usmanov, Abramovich, and their families - if they can't get to their residences in London or in Switzerland, that will make a difference.'

It was essential to hit the wealthy clans who help Putin control Russia, he said.

To weaken Putin's resolve over Ukraine, he warned the West: 'You have to hit the propagandists of war, the ones who finance the war.'

This was the only way to stop him, he said.

Russian oligarchs 'all hate him but they feel they can't but remain silent'.

'A few years ago, we thought this was just nepotism, but now we realise that this is long-term planning: he is installing dynastic rule,' he said.

Some wealthy tycoons untouched by sanctions backed Putin to the hilt yet flew to the West to enjoy weekends.

He said of the slain Nemtsov that he was a 'communicator' who was 'not afraid'.

Navalny added: 'He could bring together everyone in the opposition from liberals to the far left, but he would also talk to people inside the system, like the Communists, who did not accept his views but were open to dialogue with him.'

With Nemtsov now dead, Navalny is seen as Russia's most effective and charismatic opposition campaigner.
