Most children dream of tucking into a slice of birthday cake, delving into bags of sweets, or scoffing an ice cream on a hot day.

But for Finlay Doolan the luxury of sweets - and indeed all food - must remain a dream.

The six-year-old suffers from a rare and incurable condition called eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic colitis which makes him allergic to everything he eats and means he must rely on a drip to provide him with nutrients.

Diagnosed three years ago, Finlay is unable to eat any food because it aggravates his throat and colon and makes him sick. The immune is so rare it affects as few as one in 10,000 people.

Both conditions are caused by the body producing too many of a type of white blood cell in his oesophagus and colon. 

The cells’ job is to kill bacteria and parasites, but the autoimmune condition causes them to react to foods, which in turn produces toxins and causes inflammation.

The severity of Findlay's condition is rare as most sufferers are usually able to find foods they can eat.

But Finlay and his family are yet to discover anything which doesn’t make him very ill.

Mother Vicky, 41, who lives with Finlay, his father Jason, 42, and their four other children in Wythenshawe near Manchester, is keen to raise awareness of the disease.

She said: 'Finlay lives as normal a life as possible but he has his moments.

'When he’s with other kids who are eating he feels like it’s being rubbed in his face. He needs to be fed through his drip every three hours.

'He talks about wanting to eat all the time. We have tried to introduce foods one at a time but so far every one has made him ill. When we tried chicken he was sick for a week.'

EOE is an allergic inflammatory condition 
of the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.

The
condition is caused when a type of white blood cell (an eosinophil) builds
up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens.

They attack 
the foods, rather than allowing them to be ingested. As they build up, 
the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue, causing swallowing 
problems.

It can be treated
with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods, by taking steroid 
medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically widening the 
esophagus.

EOE was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause.

Ms Doolan has been in and out of Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital with Finlay since the diagnosis, and she is yet to find anybody else in the north-west who suffers with the condition.

'I’ve found online help groups but everyone seems to be from down south.

'I would really love to find families nearby who we can talk to about it.'

Despite his condition, brave Finlay gets on with life. He goes to school, plays on his Xbox, has a kick-about with his siblings and loves watching Scooby-Doo and SpongeBob. 

But he can’t play football at school because his drip may come out and the joint pain which is a side affect means he often can’t sit cross-legged on the floor with the rest of the children.

Vicky added: 'We bought a book online for Finlay’s teacher to read to his class so his friends could understand the illness better.

'Often when I try to explain people don’t understand the severity of the condition or what it means for Finlay.'

Finlay was always being sick as a baby but doctors said it was just colic until he was diagnosed aged three.

The Doolans are holding a fundraiser and awareness day for the FABED - Families Affected with Eosinophilic Disorders - at the Wythenshawe British Legion on Woodhouse Lane, on July 5 from 7pm. There will be entertainment including a DJ.
