A city council has today denied responsibility for the death of twin babies when their mother collapsed at a block of flats and paramedics were unable to get inside to treat her.

Jocelyn Bennett, 27, called an ambulance after waking up with severe stomach pains when she was 32 weeks pregnant after suffering a placental abruption. 

Paramedics arrived 12 minutes later, but she was unable to press a door buzzer to let them in while neighbours refused to buzz in the crew as they thought the blue flashing lights were from police vans about to raid the block of flats.

Today the council responsible for the block said the entry system was working but admitted it would review access for emergency services and is considering issuing workers with keys to avoid a similar tragedy.

During the incident in October, medics were only able to gain access to her home in Pleck House, Druids Heath in Birmingham with the help of police an hour and a half later.

Miss Bennett was eventually rushed to hospital where she gave birth to 4lb 1oz Melody and 3lb Rose by emergency caesarean.

Tragically, while Miss Bennett slipped into a coma, her baby daughters suffered organ failure and their life support was switched off and they passed away.

When Miss Bennett woke from her coma, she was then told the babies had died.

Now following an independent investigation, Birmingham City Council today said there was 'no evidence' that they could have prevented the deaths of the children following the incident.

They also insisted that they are looking into improving access to communal doors at council-run tower blocks for the emergency services.

Council spokeswoman Janet Priestley said: 'The door entry system to Pleck House had no reported faults on the day of the incident and the city council procedures for access for the emergency services to blocks of flats were followed on the day that Ms Bennett called them.

'The investigation has found no evidence that the city council could reasonably have done anything more that would have changed the outcome of this tragic incident. Health and emergency services are separately undertaking a review.

'This incident has led us to review procedures and we are exploring an improvement to access arrangements so that all emergency services will have keys which deactivate the communal door entry system and thereby giving immediate access.

'This was a very unusual situation. West Midlands Ambulance Service has confirmed that they are called to blocks of flats numerous times per week.

'They are usually able to gain access to communal areas of buildings without difficulty.'

Miss Bennett is still receiving medical treatement and is currently in the process of being rehoused.

In response to the council's findings, her father Joe Bennett, 54, who works with adults with mental health problems said: 'They told us that this was the first time emergency services couldn’t get into a tower block, which I do find hard to believe.

'We have been told that if they had reached Jocelyn in time that the outcome wouldn't have been any different, and she would have lost the twins.

'But she may not have fallen into a coma, and she could have seen the twins alive and Jocelyn would have seen the twins had they got in quicker.

'The council accept it has taken them years to realise that the ambulance rely on the public to let them get in these sort of places.

'But they have been honest with their investigation, and something good has come out of this tragedy.'

Prior to the deaths of the babies, the Bennett family held a 'Christmas' party for the twin girls and had them christened.

The twins' tiny coffins were carried into the crematorium in a white horse-drawn carriage, with white teddy bears and matching floral tributes placed inside 

Mr Bennett, his wife Lorraine, and the girls' father Kevin Clarke held a small party in hospital for the twins.

Mr Bennett said they documented the party, in which they dressed up in Christmas hats and jumpers, so that they could show Ms Bennett photographs when she awoke from her coma.

Weeks later, Miss Bennett was well enough to attend the twins' funeral at Lodge Hill Crematorium in Birmingham.

Wearing her favourite colour red, she was pushed in a wheelchair behind the twins' tiny coffins as they were carried to the crematorium in a white horse-drawn princess carriage.

White teddy bears were placed inside the carriage along with matching floral tributes.
