The debate is on over how ready England are for the World Cup, but there's no doubting that the Three Lions looked sharp before heading for Brazil.

Roy Hodgson's side suited up for a final team photo before departing for Miami as they move their preparation for this month's World Cup across the Atlantic for two friendlies before a final stop in South America.

The squad along with manager Roy Hodgson all wore matching grey suits before flying out from Luton.

Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Celtic), Ben Foster (West Bromwich Albion), Joe Hart (Manchester City).

Defenders: Leighton Baines (Everton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Glen Johnson (Liverpool), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Luke Shaw (Southampton), Chris Smalling (Manchester United).

Midfielders: Ross Barkley (Everton), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Southampton), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), James Milner (Manchester City), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal).

Forwards: Rickie Lambert (Southampton), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Daniel Welbeck (Manchester United).

Arsenal duo Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were among the squad who relished swapping shooting boots for smart shoes, taking selfies showing off their team-wear along with Manchester United's Danny Welbeck as well as Liverpool pair Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling.

The England goalkeepers were also keen to catch an opportunity for a quick separate picture, as Joe Hart, Fraser Forster and Ben Foster posed with goalkeeping coach David Watson.

England 
will play two friendlies at Miami's Sun Life Stadium against Ecuador and
 Honduras before kicking off their World Cup campaign against Italy on 
June 14 in Manaus.

After facing the Azzurri, Hodgson's side Uruguay five days later in Sao Paulo before their final group encounter is against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

The Three Lions played the first of their three warm up friendlies on Friday, defeating Peru 3-0 at Wembley.
