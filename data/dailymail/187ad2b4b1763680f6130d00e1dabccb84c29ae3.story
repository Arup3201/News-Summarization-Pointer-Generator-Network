The two climbers scaling the 3,000-ft, sheer granite face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park completed their final push toward the summit on Wednesday,successfully reaching the top in the afternoon.

Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, made 'great
progress' as they became the first to climb El Capitan's
so-called Dawn Wall without bolts or climbing tools, spokeswoman
Jess Clayton said.

Caldwell and Jorgeson, who began their climb on December 27, are expected to celebrate privately with their families at the
summit before speaking to reporters in a Yosemite meadow on Thursday.

A tweet on Jorgeson's account on Wednesday read: 'It's not over till it's over. #DawnWall'

The world was watching as the pair's grueling half-mile journey up the peak's Dawn Wall route neared the end ahead of an emotional reunion with their families at the summit. The climbers celebrated on Wednesday as cheers went up from the ground when they appeared to complete a difficult stretch

El Capitan: The courageous pair were closing in on the top of the 3,000-foot peak and if all goes as planned, should complete their climb this afternoon

The two climbers balance on a razor-thin ledge during the climb of the momentous El Capitan which has tested their endurance to the very limits 

The Dawn Wall of El Capitan is divided into 32 climbing
pitches, which are varying lengths of rock that the climbers are
trying to master with only their hands and feet. 

The wall has
been scaled before, first by legendary climber Warren Harding in
1970, but never before without climbing tools.

Caldwell and Jorgeson had reached the final 11 pitches on
Tuesday after working their way past some of the toughest
stretches on the rock.

Jorgeson struggled for several days last week on difficult
pitch 15, at one point being forced to rest for two days while
the skin on his fingers healed after being ripped off by
razor-sharp ledges.

The two climbers are using safety ropes in case of falls,
and using ropes and other tools to move back and forth from
their campsite perched high on the rock.

Because the warmth of the day can cause their hands and feet
to perspire, the two often start climbing at dusk.

Caldwell and Jorgeson's attempt on El Capitan has been
closely watched in the climbing world and has drawn worldwide
news headlines and attention on social media as they made
progress toward the summit.

According to Brandwatch, a social listening and analytics
firm, social media mentions of the climb have skyrocketed since
the climb began, drawing more than 17,000 mentions as of
Wednesday.

Several dozen people, including relatives of the climbers, and about two dozen photographers, were gathered in the meadow looking up at the face, which is called the Dawn Wall.  

'I feel like the most proud person in the world right now,' said Caldwell's 39-year-old sister Sandy Van Nieuwenhuyzen. 

Ms Van Nieuwenhuyzen, of Rochester, Minnesota, said she can't wait to hug her younger brother. 

'I'm just going to hug. Just hug. No words necessary,' she said. 'It's such a big moment that a congratulatory hug is going to be very soothing to my big sister soul.'

They started on December 27 and have been free-climbing, a technique that shuns climbing aids other than harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls.

The world has been watching the pair's grueling half-mile journey up the peak's Dawn Wall route. 

But Clayton says the men won't give media interviews at the top. They plan to discuss the grueling climb on Thursday.

Throughout the climb, both men have needed to take rest days to wait for their skin to heal. They used tape and even superglue to help with the process.

At one point, Caldwell set an alarm to wake him every four hours to apply a special lotion to his throbbing hands.

They also took physical punishment when their grip would slip, pitching them into long, swinging falls that left them bouncing off the rock face. The tumbles, which they called 'taking a whipper,' ended in startling jolts from their safety ropes.

Eric Jorgeson, Kevin Jorgeson's father, told KGO-TV that his son has always been a climber and watching him fulfill a long-time dream makes him proud.

'He climbed everything he could think of. It made us nervous early on as parents, but we got used to it,' the father said. 

'It was more other parents saying, ''Hey, your son is at the top of a backstop.'''

The two started climbing El Capitan (there are more than 100 routes to the top) when Kevin Jorgeson turned 15, and it has been a birthday tradition ever since.

Becca Caldwell, who is married to Tommy Caldwell, is also on the ground with their toddler son and has been blogging about her excitement as she prepares to reunite with her husband.

The climbers are pictured on Monday as they inched towards the summit. The first climber reached its summit in 1958, and there are roughly 100 routes up to the top
