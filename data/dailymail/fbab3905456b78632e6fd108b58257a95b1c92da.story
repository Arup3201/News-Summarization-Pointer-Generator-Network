Cristiano Ronaldo is the best footballer in the world, according to Porto winger Ricardo Quaresma... and 'the other guy' Lionel Messi is behind him.

The 31-year-old Portuguese international, who was previously at Barcelona and Chelsea, spoke to reporters ahead of his country's friendly against Argentina on Tuesday, refusing to speak about Messi by name.

'Cristiano is the best in the world. The other guy goes behind him,' Quaresma said.

The friendly match between Portugal and Argentina has been billed as Ronaldo vs Lionel Messi

'[It] is a match that is not of great interest but perhaps there will be extra motivation because Argentina have great players.'

The match-up between two players widely regarded as the best in the world has not sold as many tickets as was first expected.

Prior to the match, around 36,000 Old Trafford seats had been sold, with only the 'inner bowl' of the stadium in use. The top two blocks of the Sir Alex Ferguson stand and the top tiers of the West and East stands will both be shut.

The clash sees Ronaldo return to his old hunting ground, having played at Manchester United between 2003 and 2009.
