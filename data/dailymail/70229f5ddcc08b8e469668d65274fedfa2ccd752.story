Should scientists make the dreams of a million Star Trek fans come true by designing a spacecraft capable of travelling faster than the speed of light, it would be pretty frustrating to discover such a ship would obliterate any planet it landed on.

But that is exactly what NASA researchers suspect could happen after new analysis revealed a flaw in designs for a so-called 'warp drive' - the theoretical technology that would propel spaceships to speeds faster than light - could cause catastrophic explosions the moment intrepid space explorers reached their destination.

Rocket scientists at the Space Agency have been researching the possibility of a spaceship that could achieve warp speed travel via a real-life warp drive, the fantasy version of which is familiar to fans of Star Trek and other sci-fi shows.

World of possibility: A so-called warp drive system could propel spacecraft like the Starship Enterprise to speeds faster than light

Equations based on the laws of relativity have allowed warp speed in theory; but the energy required to make it happen would require the energy-mass of a planet the size of Jupiter.

Recently scientists studying the 
model for a warp drive proposed by the Mexican physicist Miguel 
Alcubierre concluded its power requirements were not as impossible as 
once believed.

But new research from the University 
of Sydney has suggested that, while the warp drive could work, 
disengaging the system at the end of a journey could prove extremely problematic.

Alcubierre's design features a ship made of a central pod surrounded by a large, flat ring - scientists are yet to establish what matter this ring would be made of, as it would need to be capable of bending the very fabric of the universe.

Nonetheless they claim that, with enough energy, space and time can be bent to allow the spacecraft to travel through 'loops' in space.

When activated, space behind the 
drive would expand while that in front of the drive would contract. In 
the meantime the ship would travel in a stable 'pocket', or 'bubble in 
space', according to extremetech.com.

But the Australian research indicates
 that the high-energy particles that are constantly shooting around 
space could get swept up in the ship's warp field and become trapped in 
the 'bubble', with more and more of the particles filling the stable 
pocket the longer the journey lasts.

While this would no affect the 
drive's ability to achieve warp speed, the instant it is disengaged that
 space-time gradient allowing it to move faster than light - and 
creating the bubble that holds the dangerous build-up of trapped 
particles - is gone.

Researchers now believe those particles would be blasted out in front of the ship, destroying anything around it.

In theory, a long trip powered by a warp drive could see entire planets vaporised upon arrival.

A lack of ability to reach light speed travel places limitations on fantasies of exploring the stars.

While nothing can break the speed of light, scientists have long been fascinated by theories surrounding warp-speed travel.
