A Taliban commander in Afghanistan said Thursday that Americans can expect to see more kidnappings to ransom accused terrorists held by the United States.

Terrorists under his command, the Taliban leader said, would work to take more Americans prisoner, since the Obama administration's deal to free Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has shown captive U.S. troops can be used as leverage.

'It's better to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people,' the commander told TIME magazine.

'It has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird.'

Taliban fighters turned over Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl to American Special Forces on Saturday in exchange for five of their most prized leaders -- a bargain that the Afghani terrorists want to replicate

MOTIVATION: The five Afghans released from Guantanamo Bay are among the most senior members of the Taliban being held at the controversial camp, and include one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden

Multinational troops, mostly Americans, have fought bloody battles against the Taliban for more than a dozen years; the U.S. will pull out most of its troops at year's end

According to TIME, the Taliban commander has provided reliable information in the past about Bergdahl's captivity.

Both Republicans in and Democrats Congress have been quick to raise a red flag about what the Bergdahl trade could mean for future American conflicts overseas.

Dutch Ruppersberger, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed Obama on Tuesday for setting a 'dangerous precedent that puts all Americans at risk throughout the world.'

'Since World War II we have not negotiated with terrorists or other groups,' Ruppersberger told The Baltimore Sun. 'What concerns me is the future. This puts all Americans at risk throughout the world, including our men and women on the front line ... for kidnapping.'

'What does this tell terrorists – that if you capture a U.S. soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorist prisoners?' Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Sunday on ABC’s 'This Week.'

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another Republican, said Wednesday on CNN that Obama's choices have placed 'countless American men and women in uniform across the globe in greater danger.

'What the president has done here send a very clear message, and an incentive,' he said, 'that if you can get your hands on an American serviceman and woman, you can trade them for as many as five terrorists.'

Rubio also warned that America's enemies all over the world have been watching and learning what the president is willing to do in the interest of recovering U.S. personnel overseas.

'What can they do, impeach him?' -- A frustrated Sen. John McCain is angry at Obama for freezing Congress out of the decision to free the five Taliban leaders, but seems resigned to playing the White House's game

'This has sent a very powerful message to enemies of America across the globe,' Rubio claimed, 'from Iran to North Korea, to of course all these non-state actors in North Africa and the Middle East, that there’s great value in capturing Americans because if you do, you can get some of your own prisoners released.'

Obama has faced withering criticism from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle over his handling of the Bergdahl affair, although he said Thursday in Brussels that he would make 'absolutely no apologies' for his decisions.

But a national poll released Wednesday by Fox News shows that 84 per cent of Americans fear the Bergdahl prisoner swap will lead to more kidnappings abroad.

Fifty-seven percent say they are 'very concerned.'

Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, told reporters that although Obama broke a federal law by releasing Taliban terror leaders from Guantanamo in secret, Congress would likely have few options to push back.

'What can they do, impeach him?” McCain said. “It’s a breakdown of trust between the legislature and the president of the United States.”
