Police in New Orleans are hunting a drag queen who they believe accidentally killed a transgender woman by injecting her buttocks and hips with botched black market silicone.

Armani Nicole Davenport, 33, whose birth name is Larry T. Bernard, allegedly injected silicone into the body of Breneisha Hall, 25, born Brad Hall, leading to the woman's death.

The procedure took place on October 24 at a house in the 1200 block of Salcedo Street.Â

Pageant queen: Police said Davenport, pictured in costume,'travels the southeast gay pageantry circuit and has won several titles and also (is) practicing medical procedures without proper credentials'

Following the injection, Hall began having trouble breathing, and was rushed to Interim LSU Hospital.

She fell into a coma and died two months later on January 1.

Police said in a statement that Davenport, 'travels the southeast gay pageantry circuit and has won several titles and also (is) practicing medical procedures without proper credentials.'

Homicide detectives secured an arrest warrant for Davenport on one count of negligent homicide.

However, when they went to her Baton Rouge home at 3461 Oswego Street on Tuesday, she was nowhere to be found.

According to Nola.com, police believe she is now in Dallas, Texas.

She was jailed in November with negligent injuring, a misdemeanor, and released on bond.

But
 her charge was upgraded after the Orleans Parish coroner's office ruled
 Hall's death a homicide two weeks ago, after it was initially ruled to 
have resulted from natural causes.

'It's a foreign body, and it was injected into her body,' the coroner's chief investigator John Gagliano said last month. 'You can't just walk around and give anyone an injection.'

Gagliano said that the coroner's office reversed the initial findings after reviewing thousands of pages of medical records, re-examining the results of the initial autopsy conducted by doctors at University Hospital, and performing further examinations.

She was buried on January 11.
