She's a mother of two who met her husband Dan, also a father of two, on an internet dating site and married him just a year later.

But with two separate families to 'blend' and a pair of former spouses to factor in, making it work hasn't always been easy.

Here author and parenting expert Julie Lawson Timmer reveals how she turned her very modern marriage into a loving blended family.

With less than a year to go until two of our children head to university, my husband Dan and I have been reflecting on our blended family, began in a backyard ceremony on a sunny September day in 2003.

The day we married, 'The Bigs' (my son and Dan’s eldest daughter) were six and 'The Littles' (my daughter and Dan’s youngest daughter) were three and two, respectively.

Now, The Bigs are 17 and poised to move away for university after graduation next June, and The Young Ladies (who now prefer not to be called 'little') are 15 and 14. 

We’ve been together so long now that the internet dating site that brought us together boasts over a million marriages.

I’m not sure how many of those involve children but I would guess the answer is plenty since the internet is one of the few meeting places single parents can find time to travel to. 

Certainly, Dan and I made some mistakes in combining our two families. But, we came up with some good ideas early on and I think those outweighed the errors. 

From the start, we found ways to make things 'our family’s'. My children are with us full-time, but my stepchildren are only here half the time and attend school according to their mother’s address, not ours.

This meant that from the beginning, our city felt divided, and two kids were always leaving our house, knowing the rest of us were still there.

So, Dan and I made the big decision to buy a weekend home on a small lake a few hours north of town and we spent most weekends and all holidays at 'our cottage', a place we arrived at, and left, together every time -- all six of us.

We quickly attached a number of family traditions to the cottage -- family hikes and snowshoe expeditions, wearing goofy orange hats during hunting season.

Friends: 'The Littles' were encouraged to enjoy each others company by their parents as were their siblings

Close: Julie's son and Dan's eldest daughter, both 17, will leave home to go to university next year

These were
 all things we could easily have done in the city but Dan and I decided 
to make them cottage-only treats, as part of our strategy to make the 
place seem more magical, and more 'ours'.

We
 developed some family traditions in the city, too. We live in Ann 
Arbor, where the University of Michigan is located, and where Dan earned
 his graduate degree.

He very quickly passed his fanaticism about Michigan sports on to me and the four kids, and our family still loves belting out the fight song and dressing in team colours on game day, whether we have tickets to attend or not.  

We got a family dog, too, and Jake the arthritic rescued labrador became an instant source of shared love and concern.

We also joined a church none of us had been to before, so we’d have something in town that was 'ours' outside the house.

We promoted communication. Another family tradition we started was our monthly 'family meeting', which begin with each person taking a turn to say something nice about everyone else.

Next, we opened the floor to whoever had an issue to discuss, and in our family’s meetings, these tended to fall into two categories: one, all four kids lobbying for something and two, one or more raising an issue of perceived unfairness, often with blended family undertones. 

Category 
one discussions led to household changes and often to more family 
traditions. The Bigs or Littles, or all four combined, lobbied for 
things like later bedtimes and raises in their allowance.

To
 our delight, they also came up with terrific ideas like spending each 
child’s 13th birthday in Chicago and the invention of 'Special Night' 
where Dan takes each child out alone for dinner and an activity.

Category two discussions also led to helpful changes, either in the kids’ perceptions or in Dan’s and my behaviour.

The
 meeting ground rules (take turns, use 'I' messages) allowed for 
respectful and productive discussion, even about thorny stepfamily 
issues.

Altogether: Julie and Dan made a point of ensuring all four children were present for family holidays and treats

We never split up along biological lines. If we had to take two cars to an event, or divide up over a dinnertime or a weekend, we took care never to split up into 'us' and 'them'.

Instead, I would take The Littles while Dan took The Bigs, or we’d divide on gender lines.

Related, we never (and I mean never) did any big, fun thing unless all four kids were present. Mostly, we didn’t want any of them to ever feel left out but also we liked that the subliminal message would be that fun things happen when we’re all together.

As for the things we did wrong, I suppose that will make a terrific article for our children to write  one day.

But, no matter how long a list of missteps they might list, our failures were inadvertent. If we got some things wrong, it wasn’t for lack of effort, or caring, or love.
