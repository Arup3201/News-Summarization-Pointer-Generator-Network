Manchester United’s final game of the season. It’s often an irrelevance. It’s usually because the title is sewn up, with the fans anticipating one final bow, trophy in tow.

This year, obviously, things are a little different. It is an irrelevance in terms of results – a probably unwanted Europa League campaign aside – but for vastly different reasons.

Louis van Gaal will be working from a clean slate as United slipped to an unprecedented seventh in the league, lurching from disaster to disaster under David Moyes.

Season of woe: Last year's champions Manchester United have slumped to seventh position in the league

The dawning of this new era, while exciting and relieving for the Old Trafford faithful, may not be the best news for some of the players.

Almost as hotly-anticipated as the new manager is the thought of a squad revamp, with a huge amount of deadwood being whittled down.

With the departure of Inter-bound Nemanja Vidic already confirmed, a few more United stalwarts could follow the big Serb out of the exit door.

Rio Ferdinand’s future is one of the most up in the air. Looking a dead certainty to move when Moyes was in charge, it seems he could possibly now stay at Old Trafford.

However, the former England defender – and not many have been crying out for his return to the squad for next month’s World Cup – doesn’t stack up compared to others in his position.

Out of statistics including tackles, blocks, interceptions and duels won in the air and overall, Ferdinand isn’t anywhere near the top of the pile at United on any count – even taking into account his relative lack of game-time.

On two crucial counts – aerial battles and tackles – he’s the weakest by a distance.

Ferdinand has never been a John Terry (or, indeed, Vidic) style rough and ready defender, but a player of his experience and stature should not be lagging behind arguably similar style players like Chris Smalling.

It seems every player linked with a summer move to Old Trafford is a central midfielder. It doesn’t say a lot for United’s only signing of the summer, Marouane Fellaini.

Becoming synonymous with the reign of Moyes is not something that’s going to stand anyone in good stead for a successful career at United.

Bought to be the all-encompassing midfielder United have so desperately needed – many would say the gaping chasm in the side even Sir Alex Ferguson failed to remedy – the Belgian has come up short on every count.

Little impact: This pitch map shows where Marouane Fellaini has created five chances from this season

He’s created just five chances for his team-mates this season, making just four other key passes. For a player meant to be the driving force in United’s midfield, this is ludicrously poor.

One of these came post-Moyes against Hull on Tuesday – for James Wilson’s first goal – and just one all season came from that crucial area just inside the opposition half, the area he was bought to dominate.

His current manager, Ryan Giggs – at 40 years old – creates more than Fellaini.

Flop: Fellaini was United's only signing last summer and has come up short at Old Trafford

It may finally be time for the sun to set on Giggs’ glorious career, winning just over 29 per cent of his duels against opposition players in his 505 minutes of Premier League football this season, but he’s still managed to make more incisive passes than Fellaini.

Giggs’ former role, that of the physics-defying flying winger, has been yet another problem for United this season.

Antonio Valencia is surely entering his final weeks as a United player. Comparing him with out-and-out wingers at other top clubs shows him in a very poor light.

Manchester City’s Jesus Navas, Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle and Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling all beat him on almost every count.

Valencia doesn’t create enough chances, provide enough threat on goal, or win enough one-on-one battles with his opposite man.

The only counterpart he beats on any statistic is Schurrle on going past players. Chelsea’s German winger makes up for that by providing the most attacking threat of his own accord.

One of the few players to emerge with credit this season has been Wayne Rooney. The England striker never seemed to give up when the chips were seriously down under Moyes.

However, United have built their game around him too heavily. A whole host of players have played more passes to Rooney than anyone else in the side.

While Rooney has created an impressive 56 chances – by far United’s most – he hasn’t always been able to carve out the required ball.

His go-to pass, for example, is back to Michael Carrick – who he has passed to more than double the amount of times he’s passed to Robin van Persie – 135 to 50.

Up for the fight: Wayne Rooney is one of the few United players to emerge with credit this season

It’s true, that figure is dampened by Van Persie’s availability, but surely Van Gaal will keep faith with his compatriot.

If Rooney’s face is going to fit at the new United, he may have to learn to play second fiddle to his supposed strike partner.

The England star excels at dropping deep and feeding off another striker, yet with signings surely on the way – not to mention Juan Mata’s designs on the playmaker role – Rooney could find this season’s efforts in vain.
