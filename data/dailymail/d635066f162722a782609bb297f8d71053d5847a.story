Barcelona’s chances of signing Colombia international Juan Guillermo Cuadrado have been dealt a blow, with the player’s agent revealing negotiations with the Catalan club have stalled.

The Fiorentina winger has been linked with Barca and Louis Van Gaal's Manchester United since the start of the summer, although the Serie A outfit are resistant to selling the 26-year-old.

Sporting director Daniele Prade insisted earlier this week that he would only consider selling Cuadrado for 50million euro (£39.5million).

And the player’s agent Alessandro Lucci said he was no longer speaking with Barca, indicating that the Catalans have been put off by the player’s price tag.

Lucci told Italian website Tuttomercatoweb: ‘I’ve been in direct contact with Barcelona and with other clubs. They showed interest but now there are no negotiations in place, not with Barcelona or any other clubs.’

Lucci also denied that Barcelona were encouraging Cuadrado to force through a move by going on strike.

‘Barcelona’s directors are serious professionals and they never insisted he employed those types of strategies,’ he added.
