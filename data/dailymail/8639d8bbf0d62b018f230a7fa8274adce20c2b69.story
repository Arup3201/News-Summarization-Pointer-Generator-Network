Archaeologists in Leicester have unveiled the paw prints of a dog left on Roman tiles 2,000 years ago.

The discovery was made at Blackfriars - an area to the west of Leicester city centre which archaeologists have been digging since January. 

A number of other prints, including that of sheep and goats, were found on the ancient floor tiles of a Corieltauvi townhouse.

The Corieltauvi were a tribe of people who controlled most of the East Midlands and the whole of Lincolnshire in the Late Iron Age (100 BC-AD 50).

Previous investigations have suggested that the area was likely to have been of great importance during the Iron Age.

Inside a ditch at the site, researchers unearthed high-status late Iron Age pottery along with a number of fragments of coin mould.

The Corieltauvi were a tribe of people 
who controlled most of the East Midlands and the whole of Lincolnshire 
in the Late Iron Age (100 BC-AD 50).

They are thought to have been largely agricultural people and from the start of the 1st century, they began to produce inscribed coins. 

The tribe is thought to have produced gold and silver coins for the coveted Hallaton Treasure. This is the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins and was discovered in 2000 in southeast Leicestershire.

The Corieltauvi had no centralised government, but it is thought they maintained an independent local government structure.

Archaeologists believe it is possible that some of the coins in the Hallaton Treasure were minted at the site.

The Hallaton Treasure, the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins, was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton in southeast Leicestershire.

Several years ago, the 2,000-year-old remains of three large dogs were found buried at the Iron Age site.

The dogs were average height for Iron Age canines and this led to speculation that they were guard dogs buried to safeguard the treasures.

Leicester's significance continued after the arrival of Rome, with the town being the Civitas capital located on the Fosse Way.

The site at Blackfriars has provided evidence of timber buildings and associated late Iron Age and early Roman pottery.

Then in the 2nd century AD, possibly prompted by the visit to Britain of Emperor Hadrian in AD 122, the town was heavily re-planned, with many of the timber buildings being removed and replaced by larger, stone-structures.

Blackfriars has revealed the remains of a substantial Roman building including its sizeable outer walls, internal floors and column bases of a colonnade.  

The building itself appears to have changed form and function over time, with structural alterations and multiple floor layers being identified.

Eventually the building fell into disuse before being heavily robbed of its masonry during the medieval period for the construction of the townâ€™s religious and public buildings.

Other finds from the site, which are being documented in a blog by Wardell Armstrong Archaeology, include Roman tweezers, brooches, coins and painted wall plaster.
