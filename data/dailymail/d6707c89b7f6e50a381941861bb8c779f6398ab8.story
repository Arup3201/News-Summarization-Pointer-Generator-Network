If you're afraid of spiders, look away now.

This shudder-inducing video shows the moment a woman holds a golden huntsman in her mouth - and lets it crawl on her face.

Katrina Dewees, from Arizona, US, uploaded the six-second footage on YouTube, where it has been viewed more than 600,000 times.

Say cheese! Katrina Dewees films as she opens her mouth - letting the golden huntsman crawl out

Wearing a cap, the blonde smiles innocently at the camera, before tipping her head back and opening her lips.

With her eyes wide, she releases the spider, which crawls out of her mouth - and on to the side of her face.

Grinning, the woman - who posted the video with the caption 'Anybody Afraid Of Spiders?' - looks at ease with the eight-legged creepy crawly on her skin.

Dewees then sticks her tongue out of the side of her mouth and gives a cheeky look at the camera before the - disturbing - footage ends.

Viewers will be pleased to know the golden huntsman is not considered dangerous - but is one of the largest spiders in Norther America, and can grow to a 12-inch leg span.
