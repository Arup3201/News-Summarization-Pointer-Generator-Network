This is the amazing moment a photographer managed to capture the Milky Way stretched over the iconic 'Hovis' hill.

Photographer Andrew Whyte spent months planning the perfect picture, but had just one week to take his beautiful photo .

It shows the nostalgic scene with our galaxy as a back-drop.

Photographer Andrew Whyte spent months planning the perfect picture. The 38-year-old father travelled 70 miles from his home in Portsmouth at 1am in the hope that conditions would be right

The famous Hovis advert was shot on Gold Hill in Shaftesbury, Dorset, and was first aired in 1973, starring a bread delivery boy pushing his bike up the steep cobbled hill.

It is only thanks to Dorset's 'no street lights' policy that Mr Whyte could capture the galaxy so clearly in the location.

Many of us have never seen our galaxy due to the vast amount of light pollution in our cities.

Mr Whyte, 38, travelled 70 miles from his home in Portsmouth at 1am in the hope that conditions would be right to take his amazing picture.

He said: 'I was nervous. I had been planning it since February, working with the council to check when the lights were off and checking the weather reports all the time.

'If the moon was out, it would be ruined.'

According to astronomers, the galaxy is easiest to see in July but a remote and dark location is essential to see the faint milky cloud with its scattering of stars.

Mr Whyte said: 'I like taking familiar shots and doing them in a way no one has seen them.

'But I also wanted to get the Milky Way, and this is one of the only places you can really see it clearly.'

The father-of-two quit his job running a charity programme in 2007 to become a full-time father by day and a full-time photographer by night.

He said: 'It is my passion and, conveniently, fits in with my family life. I go on about five shoots a week, but it can be hard when you're only getting three hours sleep to carry on living a normal life.

'And unfortunately it is so dependent on the temperamental weather. I have been on failed trips so many times.'

One recent job in Bristol, a four-hour round trip, took him four attempts, while getting the right picture of Stone Henge at night took seven trips.

'When I got to this one I was so 
relieved. But it is the first one I've done barefoot - people were 
sleeping with their windows open because of the heat - I didn't want to 
disturb them, and couldn't risk them turning on their lights!'

Mr Whyte said that the brightest light you can see in his photograph is only 40 watts.
