These are the excited faces of teens at a wild sweet sixteen party moments before their friend stuck his head out the roof and was killed when he hit an overpass.

The girls in bright dresses were among revellers who tweeted about getting ‘sauced’ at a sweet 16 hours before tragedy struck on Friday night.

Daniel Fernandez was killed when he peeked out of a bus hatch and fatally struck his head as the vehicle drove under an bridge overpass.

'I can’t believe that you’re gone,' Alyssa Argento, a schoolfriend from St Francis Prep, wrote on a Facebook memorial page set up for Fernandez.

'Just 5 minutes before this nightmare happened you were in the back of the bus dancing with me and all of your friends, having so much fun.'

The tragedy happened as dozens of teenagers were en-route to a Sweet 16 birthday party in Garfield New Jersey.

Some of the teenagers’ Twitter 
accounts tell how the group of 65, many of whom were from a Queens 
Catholic School, were getting ready for a night of partying.

The tweets show how the friends planned on getting ‘sauced’ at the Sweet 16 party, reported the New York Post.

Hours before heading to the party bus, Fernandez asked a friend over Twitter: ‘Are they checking on the bus??’

Another party-goer tweeted: ‘The amount of bottles on this limo is rediculous.’ [sic]

A photo of ecstatic girls, dressed up in 
matching turquoise dresses, partying on the bus was posted to Instagram 
shortly before the tragedy.

A security guard on the double decker bus had repeatedly warned the excited teenagers not to open the hatch.

But Fernandez apparently didn’t listen
to the warning, and stuck his head out of the bus’ hatch. When the bus 
went under the George Washington bridge overpass, he fatally hit his 
head.

Immediately after the tragic accident,
terrified friends on the bus took to Twitter again posting about their 
panic and praying for Fernandez’s recovery.

One friend, Vicky, tweeted later that 
night: ‘Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a 
bad dream. I love you so much dan you were there for me till the last 
second.’

Meanwhile, Fernandez’s heartbroken girlfriend tweeted: ‘I guess us kissing tonight was goodbye??’

Security guard Alex Franco told the New York Post that the teens were dancing on the first floor, and the bus was getting hot.

He said he went to tell the bus driver about the heat, adding that he was gone for only a few minutes.But
then he heard teenagers screaming, and he saw Mr Fernandez on the floor
of the bus. ‘There was so much blood everywhere,’ he told the New York 
Post.

He was a beloved student, said Lynch, who taught him last school year.

'He was an adorable, low-key kid, 
with a sweet smile,' St Francis teacher Jane Lynch told the Associated 
Press. 'Kids loved him; he had lots of friends and was popular with the 
girls.'

She said a group of students had a 
special last project, producing and appearing in a takeoff on the novel 
Lord of the Flies, about a group of boys on a desert island who try to 
govern themselves, with disastrous results.

'He was very hands-on, he took the leadership role,' said Elizabeth Gonzalez, a student teacher at St. Francis last year.

Fernandez played the villain in the 
video students posted on YouTube, she said. In class, 'he was very 
lively, and high-spirited,' she said. 'And he had so much potential in 
his writing.'

The school said on its website that 
it shared in grief and shock over his death. A wake was set for Monday 
in Rego Park, the site said.

Designer Limousines, which operates 
the bus, expressed its 'deepest heartfelt sympathy' to the teen's 
family. The company said it would conduct an internal investigation.

According to the New York Times, Mr Fernandez was on his way to a birthday party in New Jersey and was coming from St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens.

As the bus drove through the Fletcher Avenue Underpass around 6.30pm, he struck his head on the concrete structure.

The teenager was hurried to Hackensack University Medical Center, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman.

Twitter user Kaylan Baez was apparently on the double-decker bus, and wrote early Saturday morning: ‘Never thought I would ever witness something like that. My prayers go out to dan and his family. R.I.P. Daniel Fernandez.’

Earlier in the evening, she was tweeting about how excited she was for the party.

Another girl who was on the bus tweeted: 'Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad 
dream. I love you so much Dan you were there for me till the last second.'

Shock: One girl apparently witnessed Mr Fernandez's death and tweeted her disbelief

According to the New Milford, New Jersey Patch, many of the 65 teenagers on the double-decker bus ran onto the highway following the accident.

Another bus was stopped, and the remaining teenagers were shuttled to the Fort Lee Port Authority station. No other teenagers on the bus were injured.

The bus’ hatch was bent back from the impact. According to the Cliffview Pilot, there is supposed to be a safety seal on the hatch.

The bus involved in the accident has two floors with a dance floor on the lower level, as well as touch-operated juice machines, satellite TV and WiFi, as well as a V.I.P. room and two sound systems. It is advertised as being able to fit 70 passengers. 

The traumatic turn of events led to hours of traffic congestion along the southbound area of the George Washington Bridge as investigators tried to piece together what happened.

And though no other teens on the bus were injured, sources told ABC 7 that many of them suffered severe emotional trauma from witnessing their friend’s death.

Candle in the wind: Mourners lit dozens of candles for the teen at his wake on Saturday evening

Many students reported that they woke up crying or suffered panic attacks last night.

A vigil was held at St Francis Prep on Saturday night.

Though many of Mr Fernandez’s friends were unable to attend the wake at the Queens high school on Saturday night, the teenager’s friends were quick to post photos of them lighting candles in his memory.

One student wrote: ‘I couldn’t be at Prep tonight, but I do have a candle burning at home for you, Dan. Rest in peace!’

Another wrote: ‘Look out for us Dan and Rest In Peace. My candle goes out to you, your family, and those in mourning. Where ever you are the prepfam will always keep you in mind and heart.’
