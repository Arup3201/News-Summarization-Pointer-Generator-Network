The terrorist death cult Islamic State has reportedly found a new senior Australian jihadi recruiter after its highest-ranked Australian, Mohammed Ali Baryalei, was killed in October.

The fighters have chosen Melbourne man Neil Prakash, who goes by the name of Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, as former Sydney bouncer Baryalei’s brainwashing successor, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Al-Cambodi, who previously appeared in jihadist propaganda videos on YouTube, has been using his Twitter and Ask.fm accounts to answer questions about IS.

‘Worry what Allah is planning,’ the Fijian and Cambodian man reportedly instructed nonbelievers.

Al-Cambodi’s Twitter page frequently describes Islamic State activities in real time, including the capturing of an air base, and encourages others to join the extremist group.

'Heavy Clashes in tabqa, fireworks is the agenda tonight! Please done forget the brothers in your duas (prayers)! [sic]' he previously posted.

Baryalei is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.

After his death was reported on social media in October his mother and a senior defence force member claimed they believed he was still alive.

Baryalei left Australia in 2013 to go to Syria and a warrant was put out for his arrest in September as it emerged he was recruiting fighters to the Islamic State's cause.

 Mr Baryalei worked with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney

Vice Admiral David Johnston says he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed

Defence force chief of joint operations Vice Admiral David Johnston said he has seen no information to confirm social media reports the Australian was killed in Syria.

'Increasingly, it looks less likely than likely,' he told reporters.

'I have not seen anything to indicate, on balance, that he is dead.'

His phone calls to Australia, allegedly regarding a plot to behead a random member of the public, sparked the largest anti-terrorism raids in the country's history, which targeted 25 homes in NSW and Queensland.

A social media report at the end of October said Baryalei had been martyred, although it gave no details, and the Australian government was unable to confirm the reports.

Vice Admiral Johnston said he has seen reports indicating a number of IS leaders have been targeted in air strikes, and there is no doubt that is having an impact on their leadership capability.

The Baryalei family arrived in Australia more than 30 years ago as refugees from Afghanistan.

Unbeknownst to his family, Baryalei chose to join terror group Jabhat al-Nusra then the Islamic State.

During the September terror raids, Baryalei was named by police as the instigator behind a plot to behead a member of the public in an Australian city which was to be filmed with the victim draped in the Islamic State's black flag.

He worked with the Street Dawah movement, a group of Muslims who recruited on the streets of western Sydney.

The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end.

He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17.

As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group.

The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS.

'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said.

'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often.

'He was very protective of his mum.'
