For cycling enthusiasts, it's the ultimate holiday.

But with an eye-watering £80,000 price tag, it's a trip that would break the bank.

Luxury travel firm VeryFirstTo is offering travellers the chance to pedal around the 12 most fashionable cities in the world.

Pedal power: The £80,000 trip takes in Paris - as well as London, New York and Rome

High-end tour: The trip also includes a top A2B electric bike, worth £2,500, which holidaymakers can keep

The high-end package, which launches in October,  will give cyclists the chance to park their bikes and pop into the world's trendiest restaurants, clubs and galleries.

The tour, which takes a month to complete, includes bike trips around the streets of Paris, New York, Milan, London, Barcelona, Rome, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Berlin and Sydney.

Couples will also be provided with two top A2B electric bikes, costing about £2,500 each, which they will be able to keep at the end of the trip.

Luxury travel: The trip also includes a stay in the five-star Rosewood London, near Covent Garden

Marcel Knobil, founder of company VeryFirstTo, said: 'The target customer is someone who is a fashion enthusiast and who has a passion for travelling while being as environmentally-friendly as possible.

'Some of the cities are more intimidating than others to cyclists, but in each city the couple will be accompanied by an expert guide who knows the most cycle-friendly routes.

'By having a bike you can explore places really quickly and navigate certain routes which one would never be able to do by taxi.'

The cost of the tour includes travel between the cities, accommodation and tour guides.However, holiday-makers will be expected to pay for their own food and souvenirs.

Mr Knobil said: 'On the face of it the £80,100 cost sounds quite spectacular, but when you break it down it starts to make sense. 

Retail therapy: Cyclists will also get the chance to go shopping in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan

As well as cycling, the holiday includes stop-offs at tourist attractions, luxury restaurants and bars

'If you look at the quality of travel and accommodation, and the number of places you're going to, it's pretty reasonable.

'Unfortunately one needs deep pockets, but what you're getting in return is very fair indeed.'

Mr Knobil said the cities on the itinerary were decided by a poll of VeryFirstTo's 250,000 members.

He said: 'It's a really nice mix of the classic fashion cities, like Paris, and some others that have in more recent times been getting credibility for their fashion credentials in terms of food, clothing, architecture and hotels.

'There are a number of destinations I haven't yet had the pleasure of visiting - the likes of Tokyo would be an absolute treat. I know the New York Bar at the Park Hyatt would be great.

Rodeo Drive! Guests on the trip will enjoy a stopover in Beverly Hills - home to boutique stores

Culture stop: The holiday also includes a night in QT Sydney hotel, renowned for its art and design

'Sydney is now becoming quite a fashion hub - I understand Darlinghurst is absolutely spectacular for shopping.'

Other highlights on the trip could include Barcelona's ABaC restaurant, the Bar della Pace in Rome, Rodeo Drive in Hollywood and the restaurants of Bel-Air in Los Angeles and the Bosphorous hotel in Istanbul.

Mr Knobil said: 'We've had lots of people ask for itineraries who have told us they're thinking about what an appropriate date might be. We're hopeful and we think it's a tantalising proposition.'

The trip will see holidaymakers cycle from from Paris to Sydney by way of Los Angeles, Istanbul and Tokyo.
