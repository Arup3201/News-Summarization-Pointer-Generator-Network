A nudist hotel in a suburb was always going to raise eyebrows.

But now an application to sell alcohol at the naturist spa has left Conservative councillors and neighbours worried that a licence will attract 'trouble makers'.

The Clover Spa and Hotel in Erdington, Birmingham, has submitted a request to Birmingham City Council to serve alcohol.

But while the owner says that he only wants to be able to serve guests a glass of wine with their dinner, there has been objections about the application.

Councillor Robert Alden fears that an alcohol licence would turn the spa into a strip club and that it would attract 'local youths and trouble makers'.

He is especially concerned because the hotel is next to a children's nursery, surrounded by family homes and a soon-to-be finished retirement village.

'There is a risk of anti-social behaviour affecting neighbours whose gardens back on to the spa,' he said.

'There will be a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh.

One councillor said granting the application would result in 'a rise in inappropriate behaviour and displays of flesh'

'We have already had complaints over recent years, passed on to the council about people being nude in the garden and being visible from neighbouring properties and the nursery.

'Having clients who have had a few drinks will only worsen this situation.'

Councillors Gareth Moore and Bob Beauchamp are also opposed to the application.

And a resident, who has not been named, has written to the council about their objections stating: 'We believe that naturism (predominately male), alcohol and children should not be in close proximity.'

The note also points out that The Clover Spa's website states: 'We do not hold a licence to sell alcohol because we wish to promote the healthy aspects of Clover Spa.'

But Tim Higgs, owner of the spa, said the objections are unfounded and that guests will only want to enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner.

Mr Higgs said original planning permission was granted without any objections from neighbours

'I do not get where the objectors are coming from,' he said.

'We are talking a glass of wine with dinner or a drink relaxing in the garden.

'It is a spa, a respectful, quality establishment for naturists, not a pub, you can't just come in off the street.

'This is something extra for the benefit of customers, not a big part of the business.'

He added: 'The police have visited and have been supportive, there is no objection from them. I have invited our local councillors to come and look around, but they have declined. That invitation is still there.'

Mr Higgs, 56, converted the 1920s house and opened it as a spa and hotel in spring 2011.

He said planning permission was granted without any objections from neighbours.

The hotel and spa was reviewed by TV's The Hotel Inspector Alex Polizzi last year.
