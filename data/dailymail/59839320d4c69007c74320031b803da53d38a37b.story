Court appearance: Richard De Wit was lead into court in Srinagar, Kashmir today

A 7-ft tall Dutchman charged with the murder of 24-year-old Sarah Groves appeared in court today but did not enter a plea.

Richard De Wit, 43 is accused of stabbing Miss Groves 45 times with a 12 inch knife on a houseboat in Kashmir.

Despite having confessed to police, De Wit was silent during the hearing in Srinagar, Kashmir.

His defence lawyer appealed for an adjournment so a document could be translated into English.

De Wit, from Ridderkerk, Netherlands, was charged with the murder when he was found 45 miles from the scene.

He is believed to have fled in a 
small boat which capsized, forcing him to swim to shore. The accused was
wearing wet clothes, without shoes and carrying a passport on the night
of the murder.

Miss 
Groves, from Guernsey was found by the houseboat owner's son in the 
early hours of the morning on April 6 after he heard screams coming from
her cabin.

She had suffered 45 knife wounds, most on her fingers, hands and arms, indicating she had fought ferociously for her life.

De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three 
days before the killing, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves.

They were 
the only two tourists staying on the boat. Miss Groves had been there 
with her 25-year-old boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda since February.

A Kashmir police source claimed that De Wit had smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned 
to his cabin on the night.

He reportedly became paranoid that 
Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and
allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife.

The Dutchman appeared in court with his lawyer, Indian Supreme Court Advocate, Shilpi Jain.

The request to have De Wit's 100-page charge sheet translated from to Urdu to English means the hearing is adjourned until June 24.

The Deputy Inspector General of 
Kashmir Police, Ahfadul Mujtaba, said in April: ‘We put him in front of the 
magistrates today and we now have him in our custody for a further ten 
days.

Adjourned: The case will take a nine-day break as De Wit's 100 page charge sheet is translated into English

Confession: Indian police say De Wit confessed to murdering Miss Groves and told them he was under the influence of drugs at the time

Fought for her life: Doctors revealed Sarah Groves fought valiantly for her life. She received 45 stab wounds

‘He has confessed to killing the girl but at this time he is not giving any further detail.’

Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered.

He is said to have confessed to killing her after smoking cannabis, triggering delusions that she was a Dutch spy.

Detectives are also probing claims that Miss Groves, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was conned out of money before her death.

De Wit is being held in the region's central jail having received treatment in a government-run psychiatric hospital.

Police said the 24-year-old (pictured left) was found inside the boat and had defensive wounds to her wrists and arms. Richard De Wit was seen running from the scene and was captured by police 45 miles away

Tragic loss: 24-year-old Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools. She went travelling last August after moving back home to Guernsey

Life cut short: Miss Groves worked as a fitness instructor after she studied at the prestigious Chelsea College for Art and Design

Miss Groves was born in Manchester in 1988, moving to Guernsey when she was four with her parents.

She and her older half-brothers, Ben, 26, and Tom, 31, grew up in a large manor house on the island.

Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools, first at Blanchelande College in Guernsey, then as a boarder at the £30,000-a-year St Mary’s College in Ascot, Berkshire.

She studied at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London before returning to Guernsey, having decided to become a fitness instructor.

After qualifying, she worked for two years at the five-star Old Government House Hotel, leaving last August after deciding to go travelling.

The hearing will continue on June 24.
