Forget members only, one set of pranksters were determined to open their strip club to all.

The group from the Trollstation comedy team brought a dreary commute a little excitement when they opened an exotic dancing club on board the London Underground.

Free lap-dances were offered to passengers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

Trollstation created a make-shift strip club in the carriage of a Northern Line tube on Sunday 

The south London-based group boarded a Northern Line train at Morden, in south west London, at around 5pm on a quiet Sunday last month.

It took them just two stops to hang black plastic bags in the window, and get set up and ready for customers.

The 'club' was hosted in a seating area of the carriage complete with music system, bouncers and velvet rope. 

The act then went on to the end of the line in High Barnet, north London, without any interference from Transport for London officials.

The bizarre experience was captured on video where young women in colourful wigs and masks can be seen using the tube railings as poles. 

Passengers were offered a free lap-dance by the actors 

The experience was made authentic with a pair of bouncers who searched guests as they entered the 'club' and a velvet red rope by the entrance

The team had blacked out the windows of the carriage within just two stops of entering the train

The experience was kept as authentic as possible with guests who attended the make-shift club being searched by the bouncers in high-visibility jackets on the way in. 

Gomes Garcia, 22, is one of the masterminds behind the web-comedy troupe. He said the point behind his latest video was to brighten up people's boring journeys.

'We just wanted to make the Tube more interesting. It was brilliant - the passengers really seemed to enjoy it and laugh along with us.' 

Two female actors took part in the strip, dressed in brightly coloured wigs and masks

'Hiring bouncers to guard the red velvet rope into the area was really funny as well.

'I think people genuinely had no idea if what we were doing was official or not.' 

Gomes added that the group had been so pleased with their initial public transport stunt that they were planning on coming up with more ideas to excite bored commuters.

'We've got loads of ideas for new pranks involving the Tube.

'It's such a necessity for living in London, yet the journeys are always so boring. We hope to spice things up again in the near future.'

The comedy group say they have several more tube pranks planned in the next coming months
