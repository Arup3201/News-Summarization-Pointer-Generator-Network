A New York Jets player was arrested outside of a New Jersey Target in November for illegal possession of synthetic marijuana. A recently released incident report reveals that police were contacted because a woman thought she saw the player masturbating.

An incident report from the evening on November 19 shows that a woman called police at 5:30 pm  after she saw Jets tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. sitting in his black Cadillac Escalade outside an East Hanover Target with his erect penis exposed. She told police she thought he was 'masturbating'

'As she exited her vehicle, she commented to the male regarding how cold it was,' the police report said, reports the Star-Ledger.

Winslow was arrested in November fro smoking synthetic pot and new reports show police were called because a woman thought she saw him masturbating

'As she stood near the open driver side window of the Escalade, she observed the males (sic) erect penis. She stated that she believed he was masturbating. (The woman) provided a written statement regarding her account.'

When police arrived, an officer saw Winslow 'slouched over in his seat and moving around.'

When an officer approached the car, Winslow seemed startled and told the officer he was looking for a Boston market but was lost, reported NJ.com

Even though Winslow's genitals 'were not exposed' when the cops arrived, there were two open containers of vaseline found in h car along with synthetic weed called 'Mr.Happy' and 'Funky Monkey.'

Police noted that Winslow was wearing 'dark colored sweatpants' and said that Winslow claims he was changing in his car so as not to smell like smoke when he got home. He said he liked to smoke synthetic weed in his car to relax and said that the NFL does not test for the drug.

After his vehicle was searched was allowed to go home free.

Winslow's reps claim that 'nothing inappropriate' happened in the parking lot in a statement that they released on Friday.

'Kellen pulled over to a parking lot to smoke what he thought at the time was a legal substance,' Denise White of EAG Sports Management said on her Twitter.

'He changed his clothes in his vehicle as to not smell like smoke when he returned home. There was absolutely nothing inappropriate that took place and if there was police would have investigated further and charged Kellen which they did not. This will be the only time we will comment on this unfounded and ridiculous claim.'

 Lab test results came on Dec.23 and confirmed that Winslow was smoking synthetic marijuana. Winslow was charged on December 30 and pleaded not guilty. He was not tried for anything related to lewdness even though it was in the report. 

CBS reports that Winslow was suspended for four games earlier in the season for performance enhancing drugs. He claims his allergy medication is to blame for the positive test results.

He signed a one-year, $840,000 contract with the Jets before the season making him an unrestricted free agent who can sign with any team he wants.  Winslow is a 9 year veteran with 469 career receptions.

Winslow is married to his wife Janelle and has two children named Jalen Maximus Winslow who he had in February 2011, and a daughter Juliana Arielle Winslow, born in August 2013.
