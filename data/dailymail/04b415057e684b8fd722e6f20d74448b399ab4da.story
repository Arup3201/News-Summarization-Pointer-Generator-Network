Brian Wolfert said he misses his daughters and has asked them to come home.

'I couldn't possibly express how much I miss them,' he said.

Wolfert told KSL that he and his ex had experienced difficulties in the past, but they were both concerned.They both added that is was not characteristic of them to run away like this and appealed to the public for help.

'I wish I knew where my kids are,' said Wolferts to KSL. 'I hope they're OK.'

Anyone with additional information about the girls' whereabouts is encouraged to call the Orem Police Department in Utah.
