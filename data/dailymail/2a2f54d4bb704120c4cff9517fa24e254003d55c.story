Diego Forlan has called time on a highly successful international career with Uruguay, a decision that the striker says has left him in a state of 'mourning'. 

Forlan won 112 caps for his country, scoring 36 goals - a total bettered only by Barcelona forward Luis Suarez.  

He represented his country at three World Cups and was awarded the Golden Ball at the 2010 tournament in South Africa.

The 35-year-old, who now plays his club football with Japanese outfit Cerezo Osaka, told The National: 'The national team has been a big part of my life for a long time and I'll miss it. 

'I feel like I'm in mourning at the moment, but I've had time to prepare for this decision. It wasn't something I decided overnight and I could see that things were changing after the World Cup in Brazil, with fresh blood brought in.' 

But the forward insists that he will remain a passionate supporter of his country. 

'I'll love watching Uruguay on television and I'm still playing club football. I love this game, I'm still in fine shape and I've just started a new season in Japan.'

Prior to joining Cerezo Osaka, Forlan's club career had seen him play for some of Europe's top teams, including Manchester United, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid.
