Managing director of John Lewis, Andy Street, launched an astonishing attack on France, describing it as 'finished'

The boss of John Lewis has been forced into a grovelling apology after describing France as ‘finished’.

Managing director Andy Street insisted his tirade against Europe’s second biggest economy had been ‘tongue-in-cheek’.

But in a statement he apologised for the comments, in which he described France as ‘sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat’.

‘The remarks I made were supposed to be light-hearted views, and tongue-in-cheek. On reflection I clearly went too far. I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly’, he said.

Mr Street’s apology, an acute embarrassment for Middle England’s favourite department store, came too late to prevent a furious response from the French embassy. And prospective customers – France is John Lewis’s second biggest market and it is about to open a French website – took to Twitter in their hundreds to accuse John Lewis of ‘French bashing’.

But Mr Street was backed by UK business leaders, with the head of the Institute of Directors describing France as ‘living on borrowed time’, one economist branding France ‘the sick man of the world’ and a leading commentator accusing the French of being ‘bone idle’.

Mr Street made the controversial remarks after visiting Paris earlier this week to pick up an international retail award.

Safely back on British soil, he told a conference in London on Thursday evening that France was ‘finished’.

‘You get on the Eurostar from something I can only describe as the squalor pit of Europe, Gare du Nord, and you get off at a modern, forward-looking station [London St Pancras],’ he said. ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’

The 50-year-old Oxford graduate, who joined John Lewis from university 30 years ago, described the ‘plastic’ retail award given to the company in the French capital as ‘frankly revolting’ adding: ‘Every time I [see it] I shall think, “God help France”.’

He even said the food and drink in London was better than that he had been offered in Paris.

Andy Street has spent his career at John Lewis, joining after graduating from Oxford with a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 1985 - the same degree read by Prime Minster David Cameron.

He became Managing Director of John Lewis in 2007, during which time the retail giant has opened 16 new shops and seen annual sales of more than £1b. 

Mr Street said on its rise: 'It used to be that every city needed a cathedral, now it's a John Lewis.'

His holiday home, which he calls his 'chill-out place' in Snowdonia is co-owned with Michael Fabricant, the eccentric Conservative MP for Lichfield. 

John Lewis, which will not take any action against Mr Street, was forced into damage-limitation mode yesterday over fears of alienating French customers.

One said on Twitter: ‘Insulting your future customers... interesting marketing strategy’.

The French embassy said: ‘France is the fifth biggest economy in the world... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share Mr Street’s view.’

Ann Kenrick, of the Franco-British Council, said the attack was an example of ‘a festering antagonism with the French and France from the British.’

City grandee Lord Levene said Mr Street’s comments were ‘very silly’ and ‘mindless’. The high profile businessman and former Lord Mayor of London added: ‘It’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this. It doesn’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong.’

But Mr Street’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community, who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by Socialist president Francois Hollande and the country’s labour laws – including a 35-hour week – have stunted the economy.

The high tax regime has already sparked an exodus of business leaders and celebrities.

Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Foreign direct investment in France has fallen by more than 90 per cent since 2005. Hollande’s government has been a disaster. France is living on borrowed time.’ Mr Walker cited the decision by French car giants Renault and Peugeot to expand production in Spain and cut jobs in France as further evidence of the country’s malaise.

David Buik, a veteran City commentator for stockbroker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Street is a hero. He is right. France is almost a great country. But the French are bone idle – that have got themselves into a rut and refuse to dig themselves out of this hole.’

This week, France's public debt topped two trillion euros for the first time, which represents 95.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) - compared to 21.1 per cent in 1974. The European Union target is 60 per cent.

President Francois Hollande is by far the most unpopular president in the recent history of France, according to all recent polls.

His disastrous handling of the economy - the second largest in the eurozone after Germany - has seen hundreds of thousands regularly staging public demonstrations against him and he has been branded the new 'sick man of Europe.' 

Recent polls have shown Francois Hollande as being one of the most disliked presidents in recent history

France's jobless rate was recorded at 10.2 percent in the second quarter of 2014, with more than three million people out of work.  

Last month, France's new finance minister Emmanuel Macron said: 'France is sick. It's not well. We have to describe the situation as it is.'

The French introduced the 35-hour working week rule in 1999 to combat unemployment,

Two key ratings agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor, deprived France of its triple AAA rating in 2012. Credit ratings are used by banks and investors to decide how much money to lend to particular borrowers.

Unlike many other countries in Europe, France aims to bring down its huge public deficit by raising taxes as well as some spending cuts. 

France has a 75 per cent tax rate on salaries of more than one million euros a year. However, this tax is paid by firms rather than employees.

The highest tax rate in the UK is 45 per cent and is applied to individuals. 

Football clubs in France threatened to go on strike last year over the issue, saying many of France's clubs are financially fragile and could spark an exodus of top players who are paid huge salaries, such as Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain. 

There was also a chorus of protest from businesses and wealthy individuals who have condemned the tax - including film star Gerard Depardieu, who left the country in protest. 

Mr Hollande has made the decision to reverse pensions reform, meaning that most French people will retire at 60, and many at an even younger age.  

The French government's response to the economic crisis is the so-called 'Responsibility Pact', a €40bn (£32bn) package of tax breaks for business, financed with €50bn in public spending cuts.

But the plan has been the target of left-wing politicians for being too business-friendly and too austere at a time of economic crisis. 

John Lewis - the founder of the famous retail chain - was born in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in 1836.

The original John Lewis store opened at 132 Oxford Street in the spring of 1864. 

It was Lewis's son, John Spedan Lewis, who pioneered its practice of distributing a share of its profits to its employees, which still exists today. 

The first John Lewis shop opened in Oxford Street in 1864 - today it has more than 40 stores and 91,000 staff

In September 1940, in the midst of the Blitz, Oxford Street's John Lewis store was bombed, although incredibly no staff were killed or injured. 

In 1953, the main John Lewis store - still being rebuilt following its near destruction during wartime bombing - was used as a viewing point for the Coronation procession.  

Over the past 150 years, the retailer has transformed itself from a humble Victorian draper to a chain encompassing more than 40 stores and employing 91,000 permanent staff and has been described as 'the new darling of the British high street.' 

Every member of staff from the chairman to Saturday shelf-stackers gets the same level of bonus – which has this year been set at 15 per cent, or about eight weeks' pay. 

Despite John Lewis's decision not to run adverts on television until 2007, the retailer has won a reputation for creating memorable Christmas campaigns. This year's sales were boosted by the retailer's hugely successful Christmas advert – the Bear and the Hare cartoon – which became a YouTube sensation with 12.4m views.
