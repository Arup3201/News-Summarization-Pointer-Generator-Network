A major row has broken out between sports brand giants Nike and adidas over the leisure clothing England players have been wearing on the World Cup trip.

Adidas realise there is nothing they can do about their contracted footballers, who include captain Steve Gerrard, wearing the official three lions kit on and off the pitch as arch-rivals Nike have the supply contract until 2018.

But adidas are furious the vast wardrobe of gear Nike provide includes heavily branded clothing with little or no obvious England logos.

Poached: adidas are unhappy with contracted players (such as Frank Lampard) wearing Nike apparel with no England badge in sight

They were first alerted when the players went out in Miami wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with Nike FC in gold lettering but no three lions or flag of St George visible on the garments. And Nike have at least three personnel around the England team making sure the swoosh is always evident.

A spokesman for adidas, who also have Leighton Baines, Gary Cahill, Luke Shaw,  Phil Jagielka, Frank Lampard and the recently-signed Rickie Lambert in their England stable, said: ‘This is a massive issue for us and it’s very naughty what Nike are doing.’

Adidas say they have contacted agents of their players to ask for their support in the protest to the FA with a legal battle looking likely. Nike were unavailable for comment.

Roy Hodgson is fortunate to enjoy the full support of his bosses at the FA — to the extent there is no inclination to change the popular manager even if England exit the World Cup at the group stage.

But public opinion would make it untenable for Roy to remain in charge were England to lose to Uruguay on Thursday, sealing their fate after two games. The England and Wales Cricket Board were insistent that Andy Flower would stay on after the Ashes whitewash, but managers just cannot survive national team humiliation on that scale.

A comparable sporting fiasco — or worse — is to be sent packing from Brazil after 180 minutes following a month of money-no-object preparation.

Support: Roy Hodgson will still be England manager, regardless of the end result at the World Cup

Thierry Henry, a BBC pundit on Saturday night, criticised Italy striker Mario Balotelli for raising a finger to his lips in the shush gesture to England fans after scoring the decisive second goal.

Yet this is the same Henry who made the signal one of his own trademark goalscoring celebrations.

The Mixed Zone is where players walk through after games to face the media. However, the FA’s policy in this supposedly free-for-all environment is to decide in advance who answers questions.

Leighton Baines said after the Italy defeat: ‘There are names up of the lads that are stopping.’

However, one non-stage-managed sighting was Jack Wilshere carrying the bags of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to save his team-mate’s injured knee from unnecessary stress.

Burton has fill of Phil

Among the army of Twitter critics about Phil Neville’s unhappy debut as BBC’s live England match co-commentator was Sky football pitchside reporter Andy Burton, a TV colleague of Phil’s brother Gary.

Burton, who will have riled his sensitive Isleworth bosses, tweeted that Neville should ‘liven up’, retweeted other negative comments before encouraging viewers to tune into Radio 5 Live’s commentary instead.

Phil, who always prepares for every role professionally, would not have liked having to hang around for five hours in the Amazonia Arena media centre, where he tried to have a nap before his high-pressure role with 15.6million tuning in.

BBC say Phil will continue to play a key role, co-commentating on BBC highlights of England’s next two games. But they have not yet made plans for the last 16, when they will next cover England live if they get through.

News agency Reuters have warned staff about criminal gangs gaining entry into media areas in the stadiums.

This follows the theft of £20,000 worth of equipment from  inside the press centre at Belo Horizonte.

One snapper, who had a camera and lens stolen, had left his equipment unguarded while he went to a nearby canteen to buy a packet of crisps.
