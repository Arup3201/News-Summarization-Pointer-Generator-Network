On the anniversary of the day that Jeanette 'Jenny' Moss was found murdered in her exclusive Melbourne home, police say they are no closer to finding her killer.

A neighbour found the body of the 69-year-old's socialite, a widow with two children and four grandchildren, in her Middle Park home on January 15 last year.

Despite being terminally ill with pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis, Ms Moss had spent the day before she died going to the gym, meeting with friends, and grocery shopping at her local Coles.

Jeanette 'Jenny' Moss was found dead in her apartment on January 15th, 2014

She had made plans for the 16th of January, including a visit to The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, reported The Age. 

Despite intensive investigations into her death, including an information caravan set up outside the Beaconsfield Parade apartment block, homicide squads are still waiting on a breakthrough.

'It is very sad for us to say that as one year passes we are still no closer to finding Ms Moss' killer,' Detective Sergeant Stephen McIntyre said. 

The Melbourne grandmother was reportedly well loved and active in her local community, working as a councillor in the wealthy Middle Park area and enjoying a membership with the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club.

Ms Moss was on the board of several charities and was often spotted at Victoria's racing carnivals, and was preparing for her 70th birthday party, which would have been held just a month after she died. 

Her funeral was held at All Saints Anglican Church in St Kilda and was attended by 350 people.

Witnesses say that she had been spotted the day before he body was found, running errands in her green 1997 BMW, but police are still unclear on the series of events that unfolded when she arrived at her home.   

Her apartment had been fitted with a security entrance, and was on the second floor of the apartment block, which led police to believe that Ms Moss probably knew her killer.

Authorities said that Ms Moss had received 'injuries to her upper body' from an 'altercation' in the apartment, where she had lived alone since the death of her husband, Hal Moss, in 1999.

Neighbours reported that the local CCTV camera was faulty, and that the wire had been disused for several years. 

'Whether it was someone she knew, or someone she didn't know, we just don't know,' Detective Sergeant McIntyre said. 

'She was really vulnerable. It wouldn’t have taken much at all — from what we can gather — to overpower her and really (there wasn’t) any necessity to kill her ... we can’t imagine why anyone would need to do that,' he said.

'She presented no threat to anyone,' reported news.com.au. 

Derham Moss, Ms Moss's son, said that his children were still wondering what had happened to their grandmother.

'All I can hope for now is some type of closure,' Mr Moss said.

'That closure is, I guess, who and why. I mean, my mother would not have had an enemy in the world - she was well loved, she had a huge network of friends,' he told The ABC.

Despite a thorough search, a ring, necklace and watch reported missing from the apartment has not been recovered. 

Investigators have released photos of jewellery missing from Ms Moss' apartment in the hope it will provide the breakthrough they need.

Anyone with information is being urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report via their website.
