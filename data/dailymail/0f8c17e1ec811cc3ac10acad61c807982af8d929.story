The Barclays Premier League and Sky Bet Football League will hold a minute's silence to mark the 30th anniversary of the Bradford fire disaster in April.

All games over the weekend of April 24 to 27 will be preceded by a minute's silence in tribute to the 56 supporters who lost their lives and the hundreds who were injured.

The date coincides with Bradford's last home match of the season, against Barnsley in League One, when the club traditionally marks the anniversary of the disaster which occurred on May 11, 1985.

The Football League's chief executive Shaun Harvey said: 'This period of silence will give fans across the country the opportunity to remember the terrible events that occurred at Valley Parade back in 1985 and, in particular, the supporters of Bradford City and Lincoln City that lost their lives.'

Premier League chairman Peter McCormick added: 'The Bradford fire was one of the most terrible tragedies ever to strike English football. It will be forever remembered by all football fans not only for the loss of life but also for the many acts of bravery by the emergency services and the fans themselves.'

The Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League will also support efforts to help raise £300,000 for the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford.
