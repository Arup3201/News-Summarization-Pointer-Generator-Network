Ashley Young says Manchester United will go into Sunday’s meeting with Chelsea full of confidence despite failing to convince against West Brom on Monday night.

Young came on as a substitute for Angel di Maria as United claimed a point at The Hawthorns thanks to Daley Blind’s late equaliser after twice going behind to the home side.

The match was Young’s first since the end of August following a groin injury and he believes he has a role to play against Chelsea claiming United can take plenty of positives from Monday's display despite their obvious frustrations.

'You have to look at the positives. Obviously they went ahead when we were on top but we came out in the second half and got ourselves back into the game. We take the positives of the possession we had and the attempts at goal,' said Young.

'We said we wanted to start the second half brightly and get ourselves back into it, which we did with Felli’s [Marouane Fellaini] goal, which was fantastic. 

'We wanted to kick on from there and it looked like there was only going to be one team who were going to get the three points – that’s why you saw a lot of disappointed faces in our squad after the game. But you have to take the positives of getting ourselves back into it and getting a point on the road which is important.

Daley Blind's well-struck effort spared United's blushes at The Hawthorns as they salvaged a point

'We’ve got tough games coming up with Chelsea and [Manchester] City, but we still go into those games with confidence as high as it always is and we’ll be looking to get some points from those matches.' 

Fit-again Young is determined to prove he can be part of a future under Louis Van Gaal at United.

He told ManUtd.com: 'It’s disappointing for any player to get injured but I’m back fit now and I’m only looking ahead. I’m not looking back. I just want to play the best I can. The manager has shown faith in me and I want to go out there and play well.'

United players had their warm down at the club's academy yesterday as high winds swept across the Carrington training complex. 

Club doctors are assessing the extent of Di Maria's injury after the Argentine was sent for scans on his dead leg.

Michael Carrick will continue to train this week after making an appearance on the substitutes' bench but Ander Herrera is a doubt for Sunday with his broken rib causing discomfort.
