From mince pies to gallons of glühwein, the festive season is a difficult time for dieters. But one group of slimmers will have so such trouble.

Josie Gibson, who has lost 6st in just one year, Geordie Shore's slender size six Vicky Pattison and TOWIE's Frankie Essex are just three of the reality stars who have ended 2014 slimmer than when they started.

But their stunning weight loss isn't the result of surgery or extreme diets. Instead, as FEMAIL reveals, clean living, healthy food and plenty of exercise are the secrets of their success. 

Josie Gibson has lost the most weight of all the reality television ladies having transformed herself from a size 20 (left) to a slim size 8 (right)

JOSIE GIBSON 

Total weight lost: 6 stone 5 lbs 

Dress size at her biggest: 20

Dress size now: 8

How she did it: Josie decided it was time to go on a diet after seeing unflattering pictures of herself frolicking on the beach. 

The former Big Brother star described herself as looking like a 'beast.' Since then, she has has shed almost 7st and now weighs a healthy 10st 2lbs.

So successful has her diet been, she has even released a book - The Josie Gibson Diet - which explains how she did it.

In it, Josie credits cutting sugar from her diet for her weight loss, she followed a 1,250 calorie-a-day high protein, low-fat diet.  

She also worked with personal trainer James Stark who made sure she trained for 20 minutes a day.

'I used to give my body 0 out of 10,' says a delighted Josie. ' I don’t want to be big-headed, but I’ve worked hard, so now I’d give myself a 9! I’m no longer afraid to walk around naked!'

Star of Geordie Shore Charlotte Crosby has lost a considerable amount of weight this year. In May (left) she was a size 14 but just a couple of months later she was slimmer and happier

Dress size now: 8

How she did it: Charlotte's diet was not the most conventional. Her co-star Vicky Pattison revealed that she uses a controversial sounding 'three tin' regime.

'She basically thinks you should eat three tins a day and that's it. So you could have a tin of beans for your breakfast, tin of tuna for your dinner and a tin of pears for your tea,' said Vicky. 

Charlotte also instagrammed a picture of herself working out with celebrity trainer Richard Callender.  

Vicky Pattison gorged on take aways and booze in the Geordie Shore house but lost weight after the girls started eating healthy catered food 

VICKY PATTISON

 Total weight lost: 3st

Dress size at her biggest: 16

Dress size now: 6

How she did it: Just like Charlotte and Holly, Vicky tucked into a diet of takeaways and alcohol in the Geordie Shore house and piled on the pounds as a result.

Now, she's a svelte size six after insisting that producers provide the reality show stars with a healthier menu - something she says has 'made all the difference'.

'It’s made such a difference,' she says. 'You don’t get much time to cook, so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer, which we'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out. 

'With the catering, we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch. That made keeping our figures loads easier.' 

Vicky also followed the her own Seven Day Slim routine which saw her shed three stone over the course of six months. 

Following her dramatic slim down she was unhappy with the way her breasts look and recently had a boob job to plump them back up again.

Frankie recently revealed that she had lost two stone after she started working out with trainer Ian Guildford (left), earlier this week (right) she looked happy to be out and showing off her figure

FRANKIE ESSEX 

Total weight lost: 2st

Dress size at her biggest: 14

 Dress size now: 10

How she did it: Frankie Essex recently shed 2st after finding her weight had crept up thanks to a diet of microwave meals and 10am pizzas.

Now she works out four times a week with celebrity trainer Ian Guildford-  who previously worked with Binky Felstead and Luissa Zissman. 

'I was panic-stricken when I first started working out with the trainer,' said the star of the fraught early days of her fitness regime.

'I didn't think I would be able to cope and there were times when I was so worried about it that I had difficulty breathing. 

'But once I got into a regular routine, I could really feel my life turning around. I now feel so much more confident and healthier.'

Holly Hagan followed a calorie controlled diet and worked out with a personal trainer two or three times a week to drop from a size 16 to a size 10

HOLLY HAGAN

Total weight lost: 1st 7lbs 

Dress size at her biggest: 16

Dress size now: 10

How she did it: Geordie Shore star Holly makes sure she trains three times a week and says: 'I do work hard to maintain my body as I work with a personal trainer 2/3 times a week, and we train really hard together.' 

She also maintains a calorie controlled diet and has previously revealed that she prioritises fruit and vegetables over stodgy treats.

'Carrots before carbs,' she explains. 'I've been doing it for so long now that when I eat s*** it makes me feel bad. I prefer to be healthy now.' 

A typical day for her would be scrambled eggs for breakfast, a chicken salad for lunch, and for dinner, steak and vegetables.

Back in 2013 (left) Chanelle felt uncomfortable with her size 16 body whilst on holiday in Tenerife, however this year she has slimmed down to a size 8

CHANELLE HAYES 

Total weight lost: 4st

Dress size at her biggest: 16

Dress size now: 8

How she did it: Chanelle decided she needed to do something about her body after becoming 'addicted' to fatty and processed foods. 

'Food can be an abused substance, especially carbs and processed foods,' she explained. 'It's addictive, especially when you're depressed.'

To beat the bulge, she followed the TrimSecrets plan, which was designed by Ultimo boss Michelle Mone. 

It involves a 1,500 calorie diet, plus a course of TrimSecrets supplements which are designed to kick start your metabolism.

'I'd hate to underplay the hard work and commitment it has taken; but it's been relatively easy thanks to the TrimSecrets programme,' she added.

'I knew what I had to do and – with the help of the step-by-step guide – I stuck to it and watched the weight fall off. I definitely feel back to my best!' 

Chanelle also exercised regularly to keep her body slim.
