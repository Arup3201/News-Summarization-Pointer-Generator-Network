Costly: A bus driver forced Megan Harris, 11, to buy an adult bus ticket as she could not prove she was under 16

An 11-year-old schoolgirl was forced to spend her lunch-money on an adult bus ticket because she could not prove she was under 16.

Megan Harris was trying to buy a £7 child’s weekly pass on her way to school in York, which she is entitled to because she is under 16.

However, the driver from company First insisted she prove she was the correct age, despite the fact she was wearing her school uniform.

When Megan had nothing to show how old she was the driver told her she would have to buy an adult ticket costing her £5 extra and leaving her with no lunch money for the day.

Year 7 pupil Megan, instead returned home hungry that evening.

Her dad Steve, 45, is now sending her to school with her passport to prove her age.

Mr Harris, who runs a minibus hire company with 45-year-old wife Janine, said: 'Megan’s bought a child’s ticket every day since she started at the school, she’s never had a problem like this before.

'Obviously the bus driver was just having a bad day - the bus company have said it’s up to a driver’s discretion to judge a child’s age.

'I can kind of see their point if it’s a pupil who’s 15 or 16, perhaps they could look like an adult, but Megan is by no means tall for her age.

'She looks very young, she’s only in the first year of secondary school, and she was wearing a school uniform. It’s absolutely unbelievable.'

Father-of-four Mr Harris added: 'The first thing I knew about it was when she came home from school and made herself a sandwich, she was clearly starving.

Distress: Megan had to spend an extra £5 on an adult ticket, leaving her without money for lunch

'I told her she’d spoil her tea and that’s when she told me that she hadn’t eaten all day because she’d had to spend her lunch money on the ticket.

'She was really upset about it.

'She’s definitely not the sort to be rude or answer back, so I think she the bus driver challenged her she felt embarrassed and didn’t want to hold up the queue, so she forked out the extra fiver for the £12 adult weekly pass.

'I’ve emailed First via their website, telling them what had happened and how I’m unhappy about it, but I’ve still not heard back from them.'

A First spokesman said the company was sorry Megan had been distressed, and was waiting for the driver to return to work so that the matter could be investigated more fully.
