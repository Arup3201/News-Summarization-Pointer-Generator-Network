A member of a prominent western New York family is charged with stealing guns and priceless heirlooms and selling them to fuel her heroin addiction.

Elbert Hubbard was a late-19th century writer and artist who founded the Roycroft arts and crafts community near Buffalo, New York - a village that is today on a National Historic Landmark.

His great-granddaughter Megan Hubbard-Riley, 22, is a Juggalo and, police say, a drug addict who looted her mother's East Aurora, New York, house four six months and sold off at least $50,000 in journals, papers and furniture that her famous ancestor had made by hand.

The Buffalo News reports that Hubbard-Riley and her boyfriend John Lawandus, 35, are accused of swiping at least 13 handguns, including several modern weapons that Hubbard-Riley's mother kept in the house.

Lawandus, whose Facebook page prominently announces that he is a Juggalo (a fan of the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse), is accused of helping orchestrate the sale of the weapons to two alleged Buffalo gun runners.

Daniel Quinn, 19, and Scott Weed, 27, allegedly bought the guns and sold them on the streets. One of the weapons was used in a June 26 shooting that left an innocent bystander in critical condition.

Police tracked the handgun used in the shooting back to Hubbard-Riley's mother, who had reported the weapon stolen.

Hubbard founded the Roycroft community in western New York, which made arts and crafts, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

Detectives say Hubbard-Riley and her boyfriend sold off the priceless items from her mother's house to local pawn shops for a fraction of what they were worth.

'It is sad to see something so important to the Hubbard family and people invested in the Roycroft in general lose such valuable items because of a drug habit,' East Aurora, New York, Detectives Patrick Welch told the News.

Hubbard-Riley and Lawandus both face multiple felony charges, both from the sale of the weapons and the thefts from Mrs Hubbard's home.
