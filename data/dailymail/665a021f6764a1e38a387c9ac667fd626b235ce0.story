The FBI is exhuming the body of a John Doe buried in Alabama in 1981 in its search for a 10 Most Wanted Fugitive accused of killing his family with a sledgehammer nearly 40 years ago.

In court filings, the FBI said there is a strong resemblance between photos of the unidentified male and former State Department diplomat William Bradford 'Brad' Bishop Jr.

He allegedly killed his wife, Annette, and his three sons Brad, 14, Brenton, 10, and Geoffrey, five in their Bethesda, Maryland, home in 1976, using a sledgehammer. 

Their bodies, which had been burned using gasoline, were found in a shallow grave in Columbia, North Carolina.

The Alabama case came to the FBI's attention from a viewer of the CNN program 'The Hunt with John Walsh,' which featured the Bishop case this summer. They then reopened the John Doe investigation and released the photo, catching the attention of investigators.

Break in the case: The FBI is exhuming the body of a John Doe buried in Scottsboro, Alabama (right) because they believe it could be William Bradford Bishop (left) who is accused of killing his family in 1976 

Grave: Workers at the Cedar Hill Cemetery dig up the coffin of the unidentified white male, who was hit by a car while walking on the highway in 1981

Investigation: The body is brought up by workers in the cemetery. A number of forensic tests will now be performed on the corpse

The John Doe was killed when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while walking on a highway in Scottsboro, Alabama, in October 1981. 

The FBI added Bishop to its 10 Most Wanted list in April.

The last confirmed sighting of Bishop was at a sporting goods store in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the day after his family was killed. Two weeks later, his station wagon was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, just over 200 miles from Scottsboro.

Given the size of the park, which encompasses more than 500,000 acres, Bishop, an avid outdoorsman, 'could have remained in the North Carolina/Alabama/Tennessee area for many years without being discovered,' FBI agent Pamela Hanson wrote in an affidavit.

It is believed he was overlooked for promotion in the months leading up to the brutal killings and had been seeking treatment for depression. 

Wanted: This FBI poster shows the ten most wanted fugitive poster for Bishop, the diplomat suspected of killing his wife, mother and three sons in their Maryland home 1976. He has not been seen since 

Evading capture: A spokesman for the FBI said Bishop was an avid outdoorsman, and could have travelled in North Carolina, Alabama or North Carolina for years without detection 

Weapon: Bradford, who was said to have been overlooked for a promotion before the deaths, allegedly killed his wife and three sons with this sledgehammer 

The FBI has Bishop's DNA on file and will use DNA testing to determine if the remains are a match, said Amy Thoreson, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Baltimore field office, which is handling the investigation. She could not give a timetable on when the results would be available.

After the unidentified man's death, the police chief sent his fingerprints to the FBI, but the FBI has no record of receiving the prints and no copies were kept.

Since Bishop was added to the 10 Most Wanted list, the FBI has received about 350 tips, Thoreson said. 

The order was passed to exhume the grave after FBI investigators spotted the resemblance between the two men. It could take weeks for the DNA results to be returned
