 A 19-year old girl's family discovered her unconscious in her bedroom next to a pool of her own vomit.

Shayla Ream was rushed to a local Eugene, Oregon hospital on December 13 after she most-likely inhaled the household product called Dust-Off to get high. Doctors agree with the girl's family that the Dust-Off is the most probable cause of death.  

Despite her grandfather's efforts to give her CPR before the paramedics arrived, the girl was in critical condition and died in the hospital the next morning.

Shayla Ream made the mistakes over 2 million teenagers do each year by deciding to inhale Dust Off

Dust Off cuts off oxygen to the brain and just trying it once could be a fatal choice

She is survived by her mother Tina Osborne, her stepfather Doug Osborne, her sister cassandra Ream, and her grandparents Margaret and Billy Ream  and Bonnie and Bob Osborne.

Shayla's sister Cassandra has spoken out about her sister's death in the hopes that other people won't make the same fatal mistake her sister made.

She spoke to a KVAL News reporter at services at lane Memorial Funeral Home on Friday and said,'I wouldn’t want this to happen to anybody else,' Cassandra said.

'I really care about other people and for their sake and I know that my sister would care about them.'

Her sister described how the compressed gas her sister inhaled killed her in only a few minutes.

'It coated her lungs as she huffed the inhalant called Dust-Off,' Cassandra said. 'When that happened it left no more oxygen to her brain, which shut off all of her organs. And it only happened in a matter of minutes.'

Unfortunately, inhalants like Dust-Off have become a popular drug of choice for teenagers because they are sold over the counter at most convenient stores.

The use of inhalants for recreational purposes is called huffing and is more prevalent among the youth than people may think.

According to information from inhalant.org, over 2.6 million children between the ages of 12 and 17 use inhalants each year.

Huffing is a popular drug among teenagers and is most likely the first drug they will try

Inhalants tend to be one of the first drugs tried by children and a shocking 59 per cent of children are aware of huffing each year.

Huffing is the fourth most abused substance after alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.

Statistics about huffing related deaths are inaccurate because the deaths are often attributed to other causes.

Shayla's sister Cassandra believes huffing is what kept her sister from fulfilling her dreams.

'She was in her first semester of LCC, and then she was trying to become a wedding planner,' Cassandra said to Kval.com.

'She was starting to become somebody. She was on the right track to go somewhere and be somebody.'
