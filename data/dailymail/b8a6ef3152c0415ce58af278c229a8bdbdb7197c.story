Two incredibly well-preserved Neolithic tridents discovered in northern England have gone on show to the public for the first time.

The pristinely preserved wooden tridents, which measure around six feet in length, were each crafted from a single plank of oak almost 6,000 years ago.

They could be among the earliest farming tools used in Cumbria but no-one is entirely sure what the tridents were used for.

The perfectly preserved wooden tridents, which measure around six feet in length, were each crafted from a single plank of oak.

Carbon dating has shown that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old, when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area

The tridents could be used for farming, hunting or fishing.

Fraser Brown, of Oxford Archeology North believes they are not curved enough to be a kind of pitchfork and are too heavy and unbalanced to be a fishing spear.

He thinks they could have been used to pin fish to a river bed, while another man collected the catch in a basket.

The tridents are made from mature oak and required a great amount of skill and time to make them.

They survived intact for so long as they were buried in waterlogged deposits, which kept the air out and stopped them rotting.

Four almost identical tridents are known of and another two might have turned up in Ireland.

The tools were 
discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations
 prior to the construction of the Carlisle Northern Development Route 
(CNDR) near the village of Stainton.

Carbon dating has revealed that the artefacts are between 5,900 and 5,400 years old, when farming is first thought to have been first practiced in the area.

However, while they may well be agricultural tools and bear some resemblance to pitchforks used for turning hay, experts believe the tridents could have been used for hunting or fishing.

Fraser Brown, of Oxford Archeology North, who oversees the project, told MailOnine the tool appears to be too over-engineered to be a simple fishing spear - which were usually made of light, narrow strips of wood with a bone or flint tip so they could be thrown easily - while wood with a natural curve was usually chosen for pitchforks.

The tridents discovered are heavy and made of mature oak.

'It would have taken a massive effort to fell a big oak tree and split it into planks with hand axes and then carve the trident using stone tools - that's hours of work,' he said.

'Nothing fits very well so we think the trident had a very specific purpose.'

Some experts believe the tools could have been used for fishing, but instead of an individual throwing a simple spear, a trident was used to 'wedge' salmon or eels to the floor, while another man collected the large fish in a basket.

They also think it could have been used to stretch and hold a net across a stream, but the fishing connection would seem to be logical as the river Eden, where the tridents were found, is still known for its excellent salmon fishing.

The tridents survived intact for such a long period of time as they were buried in waterlogged deposits which, according to an archaeologist from Tullie House Museum, kept the air out.

Just four similar tridents have been found in the UK and all of them were unearthed the in 19th century, Archaeology.org reported.

The latest discovery adds to the mystery surrounding the finds in Cumbria and Northern Ireland 200 years ago.

All the tridents have near identical designs and show a proficiency in woodworking suggesting they were made for an accepted purpose, experts said.

The newly-discovered tools have gone on show at the Tullie House Museum, which is encouraging visitors and social media followers to give their theories for what the tridents might have been used for.

Two of the other tridents, which are displayed at the British Museum, were found in Ehenside Tarn, Cumbria, while the other two were plucked from a bog in Armagh, Northern Ireland.

However, Mr Brown saidÂ  another couple of tridents discovered many years ago in Southern Ireland might have come to light recently as a result of the publicity surrounding the 'new' Neolithic tools.

The tools were discovered in an extinct river channel during archaeological excavations prior to the construction of the Carlisle Northern Development Route (CNDR) near the village of Stainton

So far, the tridents have only been found in areas that suggest an Irish Sea distribution, he said, hinting that their design might have evolved to suit a relatively local purpose.

Mr Brown said that archaeologists have also found insect and pollen traces as well as preserved wood and seeds, which could give them a better picture of the valley environment in which our ancestors lived.

He said that groups of people were still fairly mobile at the time but were starting to cultivate the land by planting seeds and probably keeping cattle.

They lived in valleys and woodland composed of Oak, Hazel and Elm trees and at the time the trident was made, the number of oaks declined, perhaps indicating that people started clearing trees and used them make tools and shelters.

No houses were found near the site where the tridents were discovered, but there is a henge monument around 150 metres away, said Mr Brown.

The archaeologists hope to learn more about the site and whether there are other similar tridents in private collections that could help them with their research.

Mr Brown said that the tridents discovered could even be 1,000 years older than currently thought.
