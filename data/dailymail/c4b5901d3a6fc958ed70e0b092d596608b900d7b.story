Hungry councillors are set to lose their cheap bacon rolls after it was revealed that they were costing more than £122,000 of taxpayers' money a year.

Glasgow city council chiefs will axe the subsidised buffet in the elegant City Chambers dining room to make way for a new commercial cafe.

They have been under pressure for years to give up the silver-service restaurant in George Square, where they eat cheaply thanks to £122,000-a-year subsidy from the city's ancient, but depleted, Common Good Fund.

Nina Baker, outside Glasgow City Chambers, says her council colleagues should pay for food and drink

The fund, which was supposedly set up for the good of the city, had been used to foot the bill for the dining room because it provided 'training' for the local authority's catering and services firm, Cordia.

Now the council's Labour leaders have caved to pressure to give up the publicly-funded service, announcing plans to close it.

City Treasurer Paul Rooney said: 'The buffet belongs to another era. It is no longer the best way to provide either catering for the City Chambers or training for Cordia's young staff. We asked Cordia to put together a fresh approach.

'It will be open to everyone in the building and run on a commercial basis, at no cost to the city.

'Cordia already runs similar cafes in some of our other offices, such as High Street, which have been a success.'

Nina Baker, an opposition Green councillor, discovered none of the kitchen staff were qualified trainers and said the facility was a waste of Common Good money.

Miss Baker, who takes tea to work in a flask rather than enjoy free, subsidised hot drinks, said: 'I think the buffet is an anachronism: I don't see why anybody should subsidise my dinners or anybody else's.

'I'm glad the buffet will be replaced by a cafe that everyone who works can use.'

Councillors ate for free in the buffet until 2007 when they started earning a salary.  Since then, they have made a modest contribution to the cost - in theory they pay for the ingredients while meals are cooked as a training exercise.

A two-course meal is currently £3.50, with another £1 for a pudding, while coffee and tea is free.

The buffet is also open for breakfasts, with a roll and sausage on the menu for 90p, and a roll and bacon for £1.

Ms Baker said: 'The only place I know where you can eat as cheaply as that is a truck stop. And I should say the quality would not be the same.'

A source at City Chambers said the 48-table dining room had fallen out of favour, serving only around 25 customers a day out of 79 councillors and the city's senior directors, while another source suggested the figure was closer to 12.

SNP leader Graeme Hendry said: 'Closing the council buffet and turning it into a commercial cafe is a good decision.

'The current level of subsidy is not justifiable and the training benefits can be met through a commercial cafe, which will offer the kind of catering most staff want.'

It is not clear when the buffet will be shut down, but councillors have already approved a subsidy of £122,000 from the Common Good Fund for the 2013-14 financial year.
