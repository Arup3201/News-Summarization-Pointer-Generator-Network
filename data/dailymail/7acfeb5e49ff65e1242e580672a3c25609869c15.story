Health warnings on individual cigarettes - rather than just the packaging - would urge more smokers to quit, research shows.

They include timelines showing people that each cigarette shortens their life by 11 minutes and a list of harmful chemicals.

Academics from Bangor University want to carry out further work but are now urging the Government to consider the warnings.

Researchers have found that health warnings on individual cigarettes, rather than just the packaging, would urge more smokers to quit

In a u-turn last month, ministers finally agreed to consider introducing plain-package cigarettes in the hope they will be less appealing to young smokers.

The Government announced an independent review of the policy which could lead to all tobacco firms having to use plain packaging by 2015.

In this latest study, Dr Louise Hassan from Bangor University’s Business School found smokers were 16 per cent more likely to quit if given cigarettes with health warnings.

She recruited 200 smokers from Scotland and Greece who were shown a variety of normal cigaretes and those with health warnings.

One type had a timeline of 11 minutes printed along its length to show how much the smoker was shortening their life with every puff.

Another had a list of toxins contained inside the cigarette including arsenic, benzene and formaldehyde.

Dr
 Hassan now plans to lobby the expert appointed by the Government to 
lead the review into plain packaging, a paediatrician Sir Cyril 
Chantler.

Her study was 
published in the journal Tobacco Control and she said other warnings 
could include listing the dangers of second-hand smoke on children and 
friends.

Last year Australia became the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging and all brands are sold in olive-coloured boxes with health warnings.

They include stark messages such as ‘smoking causes lung cancer,’ ‘smoking harms unborn babies’ and ‘quitting smoking could significantly improve your health.’

Early evidence has already shown it to be highly effective and a study found it led to smokers being 81 per cent more likely to quit.

The Australian government opted for olive-coloured packaging which is deemed less healthy and appealing than white.

The charity Cancer Research UK has previously claimed the policy would ‘save thousands of lives’ from lung cancer as well as other forms including breast and mouth.

In a statement last month, its chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: ‘The evidence shows children are attracted to glitzy, slickly-designed cigarettes and packs and every year more than 207,000 UK children between 11 and 15 start smoking.

‘We are urging the government to introduce standardised packaging to discourage these children from starting this life-threatening habit and to prioritise children’s health over tobacco company profits.’
