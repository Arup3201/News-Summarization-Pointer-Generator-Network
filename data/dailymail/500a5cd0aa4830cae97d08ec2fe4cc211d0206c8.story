The RSPCA have today issued a grovelling apology for killing an elderly cat against its family's wishes and then making a bungled attempt to prosecute them.

Richard Byrnes and his wife Samantha suffered two years of trauma after an RSPCA inspector seized their cat, 16-year-old Claude, in May 2013, claiming that he was too thin and had matted fur.

After 24 hours of agonising negotiations Claude was put to sleep by a local vet against the wishes of Mr and Mrs Byrnes - who were threatened with prison and fines if they refused to sign the release form. 

Traumatic: Samantha and Richard Byrnes and their two teenage children, Dominic, 15, and Eloise, 13, had their pet cat Claude taken away and put down by the RSPCA in May 2013

The RSPCA put the animal to sleep before the distraught family could even say goodbye.

The couple were then individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months.

The charges were eventually overruled by the Crown Prosecution Service in August 2014 - but only after the family had been wrongly condemned by the RSPCA for ill-treating their beloved cat.

Claude, who they adopted as a six-month-old kitten, always had extremely thick hair and spent his life trying to avoid being groomed.

He hated it so much that a vet would have to place him under anaesthetic before attempting a trim.

Hated grooming: Claude had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted. The RSPCA saw this as a sign of animal cruelty

The vet, who advised the RSPCA, said she had no concrete evidence Claude was suffering and claimed his matted hair and thin frame were not valid reasons for putting him down.

However, an RSPCA inspector insisted Claude should be put to sleep immediately.

A postr-mortem examination later revealed Claude was in relatively good health. 

The RSPCA publicly apologised to Mr and Mrs Byrnes today over the 'upset and deep distress caused both to them and their children'.

It said: 'The RSPCA acknowledges that the way in which it intervened in taking Claude from his home and the subsequent treatment of Mr and Mrs Byrnes at that time was disproportionate and insensitive and fell short of the standards of compassion the public are entitled to expect of the RSPCA.

Distressing: The couple were individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months until it was overruled by the Crown Prosecution Service in August 2014

'Specifically, the RSPCA accepts that its decision not to defer euthanasia so that Mr and Mrs Byrnes' children could say goodbye to the pet cat they had known their entire lives caused great and unnecessary distress to the whole family.'

The RSPCA also admitted making a number of public responses which presented Mr and Mrs Byrnes 'in an unfavourable light to the public'.

Mr and Mrs Byrnes, from Tring, Hertfordshire, adopted Claude from a friend as a six-month-old kitten when they moved to the rural town in the late nineties.

They have two children, Dominic, 15, and Eloise, 13, who were devastated at losing Claude, who was regarded as 'the original member of the family'.

Angry: Accountant Richard Byrnes said: 'I'll never forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday'

The family had accepted that Claude was nearing the end of his life when the incident took place and he would probably be put to sleep within months.

However, they wanted to have one last summer with their beloved animal.

A plea to allow the children to see their pet one last time was ignored. 

Accountant Mr Byrnes, 53, today condemned the RSPCA for treating his family like criminals and called on the Attorney General to look at its role.

He said: 'I am glad they have made the apology public but it has taken a long time to get it out there.

'It doesn't get Claude back and we are not happy, but we do feel vindicated. Every contact with them has been damaging.

'I haven't considered any financial action, but that is something to discuss with my lawyer.

'Our children haven't been involved in this since Claude was put down as we have tried to keep them away from everything.

'But I don't think my daughter will ever get over not saying goodbye to Claude and not seeing him again.'

He added: 'The RSPCA has been shocking from start to finish, treating us like criminals when all we've done is care for our cat.

'I will not forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday.

'They released statements which were full of lies and I have nothing but contempt for them.

'The Attorney General should look at the RSPCA and see if it is fit to conduct these private prosecutions. From our view they are not fit for purpose.'
