Goals either side of half time from Oscar and Diego Costa saw Chelsea return to winning ways in the Premier League as they beat Newcastle at Stamford Bridge. 

Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham runs through how the players performed.

CHELSEA (4-2-3-1)

Petr Cech - 7

The goalkeeper was to thank for keeping Chelsea from going behind in the first half, despite making only his second league start. 

Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5

Played a great ball to pick out Oscar at the back post, after receiving a corner kick from Willian, to put Chelsea ahead.

Kurt Zouma - 6

Put in a competent display in his first Premier League start, but Chelsea lacked the usual defensive assuredness with Cahill alongside Terry. 

John Terry - 5

Not his usual commanding self, easily between twice in the first half, by Cabella and Sissoko, but Cech saved him the first time and the post the next.

Cesar Azpilicueta - 6

His afternoon was ended prematurely when he came off with an injury in the first half and left little mark on the game.

Nemanja Matic - 6

A few stray passes, when Matic is usually so certain to find his man, but was strong and solid in the middle of the park. 

Cesc Fabregas - 6

Biggest shock of the day was that he did not get an assist, but when Chelsea finally started to dominate in the second half he kept their midfield ticking along. 

Willian - 6.5

Acted fast to play a quick corner to Ivanovic which resulted in Chelsea's first goal and sent a free kick heading into the top right corner only to be saved.

Oscar - 7.5

Sent Chelsea ahead with a calm finish at the back post then played an exquisite back-heel flick to set up Costa for their second. 

Eden Hazard - 6.5

Quiet in the first half, not his usual dominating form on the ball, but produced a lovely clipped ball for Oscar to skilfully put in Costa's path for the second goal. 

Diego Costa - 6.5

Scored the goal which put the game beyond doubt for Chelsea in an afternoon that Newcastle could've got something from.

SUBSTITUTES

Filipe Luis - 6

Put in a solid performance down the left flank after coming on to replace the injured Azpilicueta.

Ramires

Came on for Oscar to provide a bit more stability to the midfield with the game virtually out of reach for Newcastle.

Remy

Got some stick from Newcastle fans, where he used to play, but provided some fresh legs in the final moments.

NEWCASTLE (4-3-3)

Tim Krul - 6

Little that Krul could do about Chelsea's opener but was solid in his first return since November, after seven weeks out with an ankle injury. 

Daryl Janmaat - 6

Sprightly at right-back but managed to nullify Hazard to a certain extent, which is no mean feat. 

Fabricio Coloccini - 6

Excellent sliding clearance to stop Diego Costa adding a third after the Chelsea striker had beaten four of his team-mates. 

Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat can do can do nothing to stop Oscar opening the scoring as the ball squeezes in

Mike Williamson - 6

Diego Costa proved too much of a handful for the centre-back in the end who was well organised throughout. 

Paul Dummett - 6

Received a yellow card for a late challenge on Willian, but overall coped well with the Brazilian winger. 

Moussa Sissoko - 6.5

Rattled the right post after leaving Terry for dead to almost open the scoring for Newcastle.

Jack Colback - 6

Did well breaking up Chelsea's midfield rhythm with interceptions and the odd niggling foul. 

Vernon Anita - 6

Did a similar job to Colback, disrupting Chelsea's forward play which has been so fluid and devastating this season. 

Remy Cabella - 7

Constantly causing Chelsea's defence problems by popping up in spaces between them and often beating two or three with his skill. Denied by a great diving save from Cech.

Ayoze Perez - 5.5

While Cabella was drawing Chelse's defenders all over the pitch, Perez failed to capitalise on the spaces and proved little threat. 

Yoan Gouffran - 6

Hit a bullet of a free kick that was well-saved by Cech, but failed to match impact up front of Cabella who needed an ally to unlock Chelsea.

SUBSTITUTES

Sammy Ameobi - 6

Almost caught out Cech with a cross that was mis-hit but heading on target soon after coming on. 

Emmanuel Riviere

Not long enough to make an impression on the game after coming on in the final five minutes.
