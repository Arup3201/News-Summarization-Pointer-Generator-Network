A toddler could need plastic surgery after burning his hand on a piece of public art.

Vittorio Mochi, who is 23 months old, suffered a serious burn after placing the palm of his hand on the metal sculpture which had got hot in the sunshine.

He was taken to hospital by his mother Virginia Mochi where he was given morphine as his blistered skin was surgically removed.

In the week since he has had to return to hospital twice to have his dressings changed and undergone a preliminary examination from a plastic surgeon.

The accident took place in Portishead, North Somerset, where the large metal sculpture forms part of a public art trail around the marina development.

Children often climb on the artwork and on her website the artist encourages families to interact with the work.

But Ms Mochi, 42, from Thornbury, Gloucestershire, said warnings should be put up that the sculpture can become hot.

She said: 'We always walk around Portishead Marina, it is a very popular spot for families.

'Children are always attracted to new things and we walked near to the large metal structure.

'Vittorio put his hands on it in the same way you would with a wall and all of a sudden he started to cry.

'I looked at his hand and it had already blistered, the skin had come off and it was very, very nasty.

'There is no warning, nothing that says the surface may be hot.

'At home I am always very sharp with my 
children around hot surfaces, but this is something that was unforeseen 
and I worry for other families'

- Virginia Mochi

'Young children like to explore and the sculpture looks like it is part of a children’s playground as it sits on the same tarmac. I have seen children playing there.

'The pictures on the artist’s website even show children and families playing in and around the structure. I think it is very dangerous.'

Ms Mochi went on to say: 'It’s very hard because Vittorio is so young and those are the parts of the hands you use to explore at that stage. This has been a very bad experience.

'At home I am always very sharp with my children around hot surfaces, but this is something that was unforeseen and I worry for other families.'

North Somerset Council said the artwork was not owned by them, and was under the ownership of developer Persimmon Homes.

The steel sculpture, called Viaggio, is the work of artist Louise Plant and was installed in 2009 as part of a public art programme.

The sculpture is designed to reflect the colour of the town’s old roofs and changes colour in response to the weather.

Persimmon Homes were unavailable for comment.
