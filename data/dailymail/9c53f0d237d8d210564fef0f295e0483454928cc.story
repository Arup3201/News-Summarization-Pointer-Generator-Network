She's the daytime TV treasure with a serious passion for high street fashion and a loyal following of stylish women of a certain age.

So it came as little surprise that ITV presenter Lorraine Kelly was snapped up as a brand ambassador for JD Williams in July.

So successful was the 54-year-old's first foray into fashion that she's been unveiled as the face of the retailer's Christmas campaign ahead of designing her own SS15 range for them.

She's back! Lorraine Kelly has been unveiled as the star of JD Williams' Christmas campaign and wows in a sequin-embellished dress

The campaign aims to showcase fashion designed specifically for women who struggle to find clothes that fit and flatter their figures on the high street. 

The advert - a multi-million pound campaign by JD Williams - is focused around the brand's party collection, featuring key pieces chosen by Lorraine herself.

The advert - set in Addington Palace in South London - looks in on a glamorous group of ladies and gents of all ages, socialising at a subdued Christmas party. There is a sense of boredom and discontentment. As a waiter passes by, the leading lady gets caught in a conventional waltz. 

Behind the scenes with Lorraine: The 54-year-old Scottish TV star was hired by the brand to help select an edit of clothes for women who feel forgotten by the high street

The music tempo dramatically switches, and the atmosphere changes instantly and guests begin enthusiastically dancing as Lorraine Kelly arrives in a dazzling embellished dress.

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'We wanted to produce a Christmas campaign that would hold its own alongside other major high-street fashion retailers own festive adverts. 

'We wanted to convey how JD Williams can "put the fun back into shopping and fashion" with the strapline: looking good has never felt so good – based around the JD Williams guarantee of clothes that fit and flatter the mature figure.

'These key messages came from customer insight - we wanted to reflect our shoppers’ celebratory attitude to life, their innate need for fashion that makes them feel fabulous, and of course feature our brand ambassador Lorraine - whom our customers relate to and look up to as a role model.'

Getting into the swing of it: In the advert, which begins at a down-beat party, viewers hear the music tempo dramatically switch and see partygoers enthusiastically dancing as Lorraine arrives in a dazzling embellished dress and joins in

Having fun with fashion: Speaking about landing the campaign, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion'

Leading lady: JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter so she was unveiled as their face in July

Lorraine added: 'I absolutely loved filming the Christmas advert, because I enjoy the festive season so much, and there is nothing that makes you feel more fabulous than a glam party dress. 

'I really enjoyed all the dancing and the women I filmed with were a joy to work with and looked utterly stunning in their gorgeous frocks.'

JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter. Since being snapped up to front the brand in July, Lorraine has helped boost sales dramatically. 

Speaking at time, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion.

'My mum is 74 and she loves fashion, my daughter is 20 and she loves it too. I've always said it's an area that we've neglected and shame on us.'

Lorraine mused: 'These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn't matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience, from talking to my mum and my viewers. The people that watch the show, I hope, will want to wear the clothes.' 

Designer style: Lorraine will turn her hand to designing for SS15 when she will unveil her debut range for the retailer
