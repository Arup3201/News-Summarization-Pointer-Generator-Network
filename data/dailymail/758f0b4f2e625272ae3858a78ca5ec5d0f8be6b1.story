Nervous: Michelle Mone is one of the Scottish ultra-rich who could move if the country leaves the UK

A vote for Scottish independence could see the country's millionaires flee to England, with one in seven of ultra-rich Scots likely to leave, according to a report released today.

Experts warn of uncertainty over the tax regime and financial stability in an independent Scotland, which could push the rich out of the country in the event of a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum.

In addition, many of Scotland's wealthiest people run businesses based south of the border, meaning they are more likely to move to England if their fellow voters opt to leave the UK.

One example is Michelle Mone, founder of bra firm Ultimo, who has vowed to move her company headquarters to England if the Union breaks up and claims to be 'very very scared' at the prospect of independence.

The revelations came in a report compiled by Spear's magazine and consultancy firm WealthInsight on the possible impact of a Yes vote on the 22,000 millionaires who live in Scotland.

Around 15 per cent of the wealthiest Scots, with a total net worth of £8billion, have their primary business in England, according to the data.

The report claims that these people are particularly likely to leave Scotland because of the difficulties of being based in a different country to their companies.

In addition, the uncertainty about issues such as the currency and future tax rates are set to prompt millionaires to seek the security of the UK, the report suggests.

Josh Spero, editor of Spear’s, said: 'If there’s one thing the wealthy – or indeed most people – hate, it’s uncertainty, not least over the laws and taxes which govern them.

'In the long, obscure and painful period between a Yes vote and eventual independence, wealthy Scots – and particularly those with business interests in England – might well hop the border to England, with its long-settled, reasonably advantageous tax system.

'That’s even before we learn what the Scottish rates of tax would be, which would almost certainly be higher to pay for generous health, education and welfare provision.'

Response: No supporters insist that the Union is vital to protect Scotland's financial future

Oliver Williams of WealthInsight added: 'While Scotland has long been a hotbed of entrepreneurship, these statistics show that a large proportion of its wealthiest entrepreneurs have benefitted from cross-border business.

'A Yes vote would therefore not only be hostile to many within Scotland’s wealthy community, but could affect the fortunes of its future entrepreneurs.

'A newly independent Scotland would put many wealthy business owners in an awkward position where they no longer live in the same country as their company. Millionaires across Scotland may suddenly have to choose in which country to declare their domicile and where to keep their millions.'

Estate agents have warned that the uncertainty caused by Scottish independence would be devastating for the high-end property market - one said yesterday that £5million worth of deals would fall through in the event of a Yes vote on Thursday.

A City law firm warned today that investors would shy away from putting money into Scottish infrastructure projects if the country voted for independence, because public-private partnerships would no longer be backed by the British Government.

RPC said: 'For some time foreign investors have been delaying investments in PPP projects in Scotland because they are worried about having the implied guarantee of the UK Government replaced with the much smaller and potentially weaker Scottish balance sheets.

'Delays in getting investments from overseas investors into Scottish infrastructure projects are only going to get longer if Scotland decides to vote "yes".'

A string of high-profile businesses and entrepreneurs, from BP to Sir Richard Branson, have warned of the economic instability from which an independent Scotland could suffer.

However, the Yes campaign insists that Scotland would be one of the world's wealthiest countries, and claims the support of 3,000 Scottish businessmen.
