This is the shocking moment a pair of drug addicts slumped on the floor of a public toilet after taking legal highs.

The two addicts had injected themselves just yards from a popular park full of adults and children at lunchtime.

The pair are thought to have bought the legal highs from a nearby shop before going into the toilet in broad daylight for a fix. 

When police arrived one of the men came around while it took around ten minutes to wake the other from his drug-fuelled daze.

This is the shocking moment a pair of junkies slumped on the floor of a public toilet after taking legal highs

No arrests were made because the men were not in possession of any illegal substances.

The incident took place around 2pm one Monday next to Castle Green in Taunton, Somerset and just metres from the plush Castle Hotel.

Avon and Somerset police condemned the druggies' behaviour and said they feared it was only a matter of time before a child pricked themselves on one of their discarded needles.

Acting Inspector Neil Kimmins said: 'The public who pay their taxes shouldn't have this experience coming into Taunton.

Legal highs have seen an 'unprecedented expansion' in Britain in recent years - with one in ten people in Britain now admitting they have tried the drugs.

New types of the dangerous drugs are being detected at the rate of two a week, a report has found. And the unprecedented rise in the number of potentially toxic new chemicals has left police and drug agencies in the UK struggling to keep up.

The UN's Global Synthetic Drugs Assessment report said 348 legal highs have been identified across the globe, with 97 new substances detected last year alone - up from 8 new ones a year earlier.

Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy while having enough differences in their chemical make-up to get around existing bans.

Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts to try to skirt the law. Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited.

Users of so-called designer drugs were warned that they are playing 'Russian Roulette' with their lives after a huge surge in the number of deaths. 

Doctors and nurses in Britain have been left 'powerless' to treat casualties when they fall ill because they are unable to identify what substances they have taken so cannot provide appropriate medical care.

'It's not right that people in that lovely area sit down to have their lunch and before they leave go into the toilets to see this.

'Our fear is that if people are injecting in public toilets in broad daylight, then children could go into the toilets, pick up a used needle and accidentally stab themselves. I can see it's only a matter of time.'

The number one shop for selling legal highs in Taunton is Hush, which is part of a chain of three stores in the Westcountry.

On its website, the company describes itself as 'biggest and best selling Head Shops in the South West'.

There is no law against Hush selling legal highs - providing it is not suggested they are for human consumption.

But the firm has been shrouded in controversy in recent years.

Simon Tomlin and Paris Newton, the owners, were ordered to pay more than £210,000 in fines, costs and confiscation orders last year after admitting having banned substances at their shops.

It is unknown whether the drug users photographed on the floor of the public toilets had bought their legal highs from Hush.

But one officer, from Avon and Somerset Police, has said he believes most of the town's 20 - 30 regular legal high users buy their product at the store.

No one was from Hush was available to comment today. 

People can't be prosecuted for purchasing 'legal highs', which are often advertised as plant food and 'not for human consumption'.

The latest official UK figures show 68 deaths were linked to legal highs in 2012, up from 10 in 2009

A recent report from The United Nations showed there were now 348 types of legal highs - an increase of 100 in the last year.

David Raynes, a spokesperson for the National Drug Prevention Alliance, yesterday blamed the government's lack of action for the rise in the use of legal highs.

He said: 'Shops on high streets have been banned in Portugal, Poland and Ireland so why not in the UK?

'They might be billed as bath salts or plant food but we all know what they are sold for.

'Lots of the substances aren't suitable for consumption, but the shop owners don't care, they are just in it to make money.

'We have campaigned against new psychoactive substances (legal highs) but the government is just sitting on its hands. It is paralysis by analysis.

'I question why these shops are allowed to be open on a High Street and why they can't just be banned.' 

Police in Taunton have been on a drug offensive after several problems in the area were linked to illegal drugs and legal highs.

In order to combat the rising problem, Avon and Somerset Police launched Operation Cortez and stepped up their efforts after multiple drug dealers were jailed and begging in the area was linked to drugs.

Earlier this month, a top detective in the area, Detective Inspector Ray Hulin, claimed that legal high shops were “a disgrace”.

The comments came after the legal high shop, Hush, was linked to the death of a fully functioning man who took the legal high Green Goblins and proceeded to repeatedly bang his head against a wall.

This followed on from a rise in begging and anti-social behaviour throughout the area that were linked to the substances.

Police, using Operation Gratuity, were urging people not to give money beggars, as rather than spending the money on food or shelter, they were purchasing legal highs.

Speaking at the time, Taunton Town Centre team's Sgt Neil Kimmins said the operation isn't targeting the vulnerable.

He added: 'Our intelligence suggests a minority of people have become dependent on alcohol and the latest legal high drugs for a number of reasons.

'In a minority of cases, they resort to begging to raise money to pay for these items.

'While organisations such as TAH provide support and housing for those who find themselves homeless and suffering with related health issues, not all people necessarily wish to engage with them.

'To disrupt and act in an anti-social manner in the town centre isn't acceptable and won't be tolerated.'

Several people have also been jailed over several months following drug offences.

Alan Murphy was jailed for five years after he was found guilty of two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and two counts of possession with intent to supply Class  drugs in Taunton. The court also ordered him had to pay back £1,497.56.

Operation Cortez also had similar success in the area, catching two people red handed of drug dealing.

First was Shane Barrett, of Laverock Court,Taunton, who was caught dealing class A drugs such as Cocaine outside a drug rehabilitation centre. The 43-year-old was jailed for five years on March 3rd after he admitted six counts of supplying class A drugs.

Nicholas Milton, 47, of Cheddon Road, Taunton, was also caught out by Operation Cortez.

He admitted supplying Class A drugs, possession of Class A and possession of Class B and was at Taunton Crown Court on Monday.

Milton was given a two-year community order with drug rehabilitation requirement and ordered to pay £250 costs and £60 surcharge.
