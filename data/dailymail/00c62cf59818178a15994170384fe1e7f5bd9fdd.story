Gordon Greer was surprised to hear Robert Lewandowski complaining about his robust challenge in Scotland's 2-2 draw against Poland last month.

The 33-year-old Brighton defender made his competitive debut in the European Championship qualifier in Warsaw and after 10 minutes left the Bayern Munich star in agony with a tackle described afterwards by Lewandowski as 'brutal'.

The Pole also claimed that only a hammer could have inflicted similar damage to his shin guard.

However, speaking ahead of the Group D game against Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night, Greer said: 'It must have annoyed him to speak about it.

'But I didn't really expect anything to come of it so I was a bit surprised after the game that there was a bit made of it.

'I didn't think there was anything wrong with the tackle and neither did the referee.

'Obviously he was a bit upset by the challenge. It's just one of these things.

'I don't really know what to make of it. It doesn't really bother me to be honest. These things happen in football but I thought the game was played in a good spirit.'

Greer, who only made his debut a year ago against the USA at Hampden Park, partnered Russell Martin in the absence of the injured Grant Hanley, who is fit again.

But Greer is hoping to keep his place in the side for the visit of the Irish.

He said: 'I've been privileged to be part of the squad. I'm honoured and every time I come away I try my best. Luckily for me I've managed to play a few games.

'It's just about doing my best in training, doing as well as I can and it's up to the manager and everybody feels the same.

'Everybody has a chance and when you get your opportunity it is up to you to take it.

'I was happy with how I performed against Poland but there's competition for places.'

Scotland take on England in a friendly at Celtic Park on November 18.
