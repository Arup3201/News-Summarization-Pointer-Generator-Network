TV psychologist Dr Phil has been accused of having a teenage girl 'incarcerated' in a 'private prison' in Utah instead of giving her psychological counseling.

In a lawsuit filed by Missouri couple Terri and David Myers, they claim they approached Phil McGraw for help after their 15-year-old daughter had been seeking sex with older men online.

But instead of showing sympathy, McGraw allegedly berated the mother for failing her child 'by a 
country mile' and attacked the daughter for seeking sex on the Internet, when they appeared on his show last year.

Claims: Dr Phil has been accused in a lawsuit of sending a troubled teenager who appeared on his show to a 'private prison'

The teenager, identified only as SM in the suit, had started soliciting sex after she and another 15-year-old girl saw the adult they had been in a sexual relationship with killed in front of them.

She appeared on an episode of Dr Phil, called Young, Online and Out Of Control, which was broadcast on February 23.

After allegedly chastising the girl and her mother, Dr Phil offered free treatment at Island View in Utah which, according to the lawsuit, is a 'punitive behavior modification lock-down facility' and a 'private prison'.

Despite the parents' concern for their daughter, who had witnessed a murder, 'Dr Phil, however, knew or should have known, that any placement at Island View would subject S.M. to such a demented regimen that she would be at risk of her problems being exacerbated.'

The residential facility in Syracuse, Utah, describes itself as a 'therapeutic boarding school'.

Children staying there are taught in small groups and the therapy program lasts, on average, eight to ten months.

During her stay, the girl's right arm was allegedly broken and the nerves severely damaged after a confrontation with a teacher and guards.Â 

'Given the rapes and murder she had been through, the last thing any untrained male should have done was to assault her,' the lawsuit states, according to Courthouse News.

The suit also claimed that McGraw 'was paid either in money or notoriety, or both,' for endorsing Island 
View and other 'abusive' facilities.

The lawsuit alleges false imprisonment, 
negligence, personal injury, breach of fiduciary duty, slavery and 
other misdeeds.

It is seeking unspecified damages from the Dr Phil 
Organization, CRC Health Group, Bain Capital, Aspen Education 
Group, Island View Academy, and Island view employee Ryan Mortenson.

A lawyer for McGraw told The Wrap the couple's daughter was at Island View voluntarily and that although McGraw recommended treatment, he didn't control it or have any influence over it.

The lawyer added that the lawsuit alleges no facts that state McGraw
 had participated in any of the claims listed in the complaint.

No comment has yet been made by Island View.
