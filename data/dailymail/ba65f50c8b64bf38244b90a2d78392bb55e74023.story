Pain: Peter Mantell, a retired aircraft fitter, said nurses told him he would be kept in overnight for observation

An elderly patient was sent home from hospital in the middle of the night - in a taxi wearing a flimsy gown and slippers.

Peter Mantell, 73, described the experience as the most ‘degrading’ of his life.

He went to the A&E department at Stepping Hill in Stockport at around 11.30pm after developing complications following a knee-replacement operation and was given a bed.

Mr Mantell, a retired aircraft fitter, and his partner Sylvia Smith, 63, say nurses told them he would be kept in overnight for observation.

Ms Smith went home with his clothes and promised to return the next day to collect him. But just hours later - at around 3.30am - Mr Mantell was approached by staff who said he had been checked over and was now able to go home.

He said he pleaded with medics to allow him to remain on a ward - because he had no clothes, nobody to pick him up and was on crutches.

But his pleas were ignored and he was instead told to go home in his hospital gown - and staff would call a taxi to transport him.

He arrived back at his Reddish home at around 4.30am - but ended up being readmitted three days later with the same complaint.

Mr Mantell said: 'I was disgusted with the way I was treated - it was like a cattle run.

'I was wearing a thin hospital gown - one of those that you tie at the back - and my slippers. I was also on crutches. It stunned me that they thought it was fine to discharge me like that and when they told me they’d call for a taxi, I was speechless.

'I was still in a lot of pain and I felt they just wanted to get rid of me, like I was too much trouble. I never expected to be chucked out, especially not in the middle of the night. I was just told to wait for the taxi in the waiting room. At one point it all got a bit much and I was breaking down - it was so distressing.'

Mr Mantell had been originally admitted to Stepping Hill on March 8 for a knee replacement operation. He had the surgery the next day but then developed an infection in his leg and a blood clot on his lung.

He was allowed home for the first time on March 22 at 2pm but he was rushed back in the next day at 11.30pm after he continued to feel unwell.

Ms Smith, a retired cafe owner, said: 'When we got to A&E they said they needed to monitor him overnight so I went home. But they gave him medication and sent him home in the early hours. I couldn’t believe it when he arrived back within hours of going in - I was stunned.'

Ms Smith called the hospital again on March 27 to complain her partner was still in agony - but was told to call their GP as he was no longer their patient. Mr Mantell said: 'We called the GP and they said to dial 999 as it sounded serious.

'The infection in my leg was still there and it had to be drained. I ended up being in hospital for almost a week. Stepping Hill’s motto is ‘every patient matters’ - to me, that’s just a joke. I never want to go back there. I’m scared to be ill.'

David Cameron this week called for patients to be treated with dignity and respect as hospitals were told to end the practice of discharging vulnerable people from wards during the night.

Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the Medical Director of the NHS, wrote to Strategic Health Authorities urging them to ‘urgently’ review their practices after it emerged hundreds of thousands of patients are sent home in the middle of the night.

Freedom of Information requests revealed that, out of 100 NHS trusts, 239,233 patients had been sent home between 11pm and 6am last year.

A spokesman for Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stepping Hill, said: 'We will never discharge a patient unless it is safe to do so and they have appropriate arrangements at home.

'When people attend the A&E department they are assessed and then either given immediate treatment and return home or admitted as an inpatient.

'After Mr Mantell had been assessed and treated by our A&E staff, he did not require hospital admission. We therefore arranged for a taxi to take him direct to his home where we knew he would not be alone. We are very sorry for any distress caused to Mr Mantell and his family.'

Stepping Hill remains at the centre of a police investigation into 22 suspected cases of insulin poisoning that is suspected to have led to seven deaths.

Nurse Victorino Chua, 46, was arrested on suspicion of murdering three 
patients and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to 18 others at 
the hospital in January. He was later bailed.
