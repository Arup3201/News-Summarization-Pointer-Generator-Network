Here's a sobering thought for anyone who’s ever been tempted to have a sangria or three too many on holiday.

Winding your way back to your villa or hotel could be about to become even more fraught... because Spain is considering breathalysing pedestrians.

A crackdown on ‘drink-walking’ has been proposed by the country’s Directorate General of Traffic as part of a raft of measures aimed at improving road safety.

The draft legislation would see pedestrians subjected to on-the-spot alcohol and drug testing if they are implicated in an accident, just as drivers involved in them are.

Supporters of the scheme, which would also see pedestrians reclassified as ‘users of the road’ with the same responsibilities to keep safe as drivers, hope it will deter drunks from staggering into the path of oncoming traffic.

But critics such as the group La Red de Ciudades que Caminan (The Network of Walking Cities), which encourages city-goers to get around on foot, have said it is tantamount to ‘criminalising pedestrians’ when they in fact ‘normally tend to be the victims’.

The traffic directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians, who are thought to have broken the law.

Maria Segui Gomes, the organisation’s director, said: ‘Municipal police have been carrying out these tests for months – there is nothing new here that will allow us to start sanctioning pedestrians, whether economically or with penalty points.’

A 2011 study published in the Journal of Trauma found 55 per cent of walkers under the influence of alcohol ignored pedestrian crossings, compared to just 22 per cent of sober ones.

Around one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads in Britain is drunk at the time, according to Department of Transport figures.
