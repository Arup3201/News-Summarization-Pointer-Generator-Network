Most football fans had a punt on the World Cup, but Jon Jolley had more to lose than most.

After betting £100 on Brazil to win for the fifth time - with top striker Neymar claiming the golden boot - at 20-1, the Arsenal fan thought he was on to a sure thing.

So much so, Jolley, from Wrexham, boasted: 'If Brazil don't win the world cup I will climb Snowdon in a thong.'

Long way down: Jon Jolley climbs Snowdon wearing nothing but a thong after losing a football bet

Fast-forward to July 22 - weeks after Brazil was mercilessly thrashed 7-1 by Germany in the semi-finals - and the 29-year-old kept his promise.

Wearing nothing but a Welsh thong dragon, Jolley made the three-and-a-half-hour steep climb - 3,560ft above seal level - raising money for Cancer Research UK.

According to walesonline, it took Jolley and and friend Leighton Cox, the designated cameraman, three-and-half hours to reach the summit of the North Wales mountain on Tuesday.

'I think I'm a man of my word,' joked Jon, speaking from the top of the mountain.

'I usually make a bet and keep my mouth shut, but this time the likes of Neymar and David Luiz let me down big time.

'After sobbing uncontrollably for several hours, I realised I could turn this situation right around.

'By doing the climb for charity I turned this negative into a positive by becoming the first man to climb the mountain in a thong – I think.'

Jolley had initially set out to raise £150 for charity but has now raised £450. To donate to the cause, visit his justgiving.com page.
