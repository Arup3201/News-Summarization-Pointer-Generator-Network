The Queen of Belgium still managed to dazzle at a public appearance in Brussels, despite having to face the cameras on crutches after twisting her knee.

Queen Mathilde grasped her husband King Philippe for support as she temporarily abandoned the aids for a photo opportunity as she arrived for a meeting at the EU Parliament today.

The brace was clearly visible as the royal, 42, simply powered on with her duties despite the awkward injury.

As reported by Hello the queen did not let the setback stop her from looking her best, as she sported a flattering orange-and-black block colour pencil dress.

Even while holding on to her husband of 16 years so as not to fall, while the couple were welcomed to the meeting by EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mathilde maintained her poise.

She and Philippe were also greeted by Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament.

The queen showed no signs of pain or made any complaints. 

The group stopped to have their photographs taken, at which point Mathilde gave her crutches to her aide. 

With a little help from her husband, she was able to stand upright, linking arms with Philippe.

Next up was a visit to the European Council building in the afternoon during the royal tour of EU institutions.  

The royal palace would only confirm that Mathilde had sustained a knee injury during a fall.

She will not need an operation but will have to wear the brace for several weeks.

In the meantime she will continue to soldier on with her pre-scheduled engagements.

While it is not yet clear when the accident happened, it seems to have taken place earlier this week. 

Mathilde welcomed Ertharin Cousin, director of the United Nations World Food Programme, to the royal palace on Monday – and was pictured not wearing a brace.
