The women in Harry Styles’s life may come and go – but there is one who has a constant place by his side.

The One Direction star is rarely seen far from his older sister Gemma, who has accompanied the band on tour around the world and regularly joins her heart-throb brother on nights out with his famous friends.

Now, talented Gemma, who has almost two million Twitter followers and has been described by fans as the behind-the-scenes sixth member of the band, seems to be harbouring ambitions to become a celebrity in her own right.

The news comes as The Mail on Sunday announces that next week, a free One Direction poster will be given away with the paper – and that readers will be able to collect a free and exclusive video CD, featuring behind-the-scenes film clips of the band as well as concert footage.

Gemma’s musical ambitions have been the talk of One Direction internet message boards and fan sites – and those who follow the band closely believe she has already recorded a demo tape.

She is sure to gain the support of her 19-year-old brother, who has always been vocal about the love he has for his family.

He sees his mum as one of his best 
friends – revealing that she is the person he goes to for advice on his 
love life – and is so devoted to 22-year-old Gemma, he had her name 
tattooed in Hebrew on his left shoulder last year.

Romances: Since being propelled to super-stardom, Harry has been linked with a number of women, including American singer Taylor Swift (left) and supermodel Cara Delevingne (right)

After Gemma graduated from Sheffield University with a first-class degree in July, Harry flew her to Las Vegas to join the band on tour in America for a month. 

Despite Harry’s whirlwind schedule, the pair still found time to enjoy some quality time together.

While in Boulder, Colorado, they posted photos on social-networking sites of them riding bikes around the city, with Harry tweeting: ‘Just rode a bicycle round town . . . got frozen yoghurt and rode back. Nice night.’

Adding a picture of Gemma on her bike to his Twitter photos, Harry joked: ‘You’re supposed to take your feet off the ground, donut.’

Gemma was also spotted at a One Direction concert at the O2 Arena in London, cheering on her brother performing alongside bandmates Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik, all 20, and Louis Tomlinson, 21.

Harry has been romantically linked with a
number of women since being propelled to super-stardom, including 
American singer Taylor Swift and supermodel Cara Delevingne.

But no matter what’s going on in his private life, he always seems to have time for Gemma, who has become part of the former X Factor star’s celebrity entourage.

Earlier this month, she was spotted accompanying Harry for a drink with his close friend, radio DJ Nick Grimshaw as well as Kelly Osbourne and her fiance Matthew Mosshart. 

The close relationship of the siblings, who grew up together in Cheshire, has long been a source of jealousy among Harry’s loyal female fans, with the pair often tweeting each other light-heartedly when Harry’s schedule forces them apart.

In one tweet to her brother – one of the biggest heart-throbs of his generation – the young Miss Styles said last year: ‘Can’t open a magazine without seeing your ugly mug.’

While Harry has previously credited his older sister with keeping him grounded as his band was propelled to stardom, Gemma has always stood by him, describing him as ‘very thoughtful and caring’.

One Direction’s popularity looks set to continue after the band announced a new record deal worth an estimated £10 million with Simon Cowell’s label Syco.

The band are expected to produce two studio albums and a greatest hits collection – following on from the new album Midnight Memories, available from late November.
