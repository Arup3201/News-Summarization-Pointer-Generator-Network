They say that true love is hard to find. But as it is revealed that millions of us have actually been struck down by Cupid's arrow after just one glance, perhaps in reality it is not as hard as previously thought.

A new study has found that a third of us have fallen in love at first sight - suggesting that we are still a nation of romantics.

Sadly much of this love remains unspoken, with one in six Brits falling head over heels for a work colleague but keeping their feelings under wraps.

And 11 per cent of men even confess losing their heart to a friend’s wife or girlfriend, but never letting on.

Love at first sight? A third of us say we have been struck down by Cupid's arrow at first glance, a new study has revealed

The research found that in an age of social networking internet dating we still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter.

And 60 per cent of Brits have never had a one night stand as they hold out for Mr or Mrs Right.

Unfortunately, there is often a difference between what we want and what we get, the study by flower delivery company Interflora revealed. 

While 41 per cent of women insist a handwritten card or letter is the way to their heart, men are more likely to profess their undying love by text.

One in five British men (19 per cent) have said ‘I love you’ by SMS, compared to just 17 per cent who have actually written it in a letter.

One in five (20 per cent) believe love should be declared with flowers, while 10 per cent say a poem is most romantic.

The research into modern relationships, conducted in the run up to Valentine’s Day, found the notion of love at first sight is far from dying out.

Not only do 31 per cent say they’ve been struck by Cupid’s arrow, but this rises to 37 per cent among those aged 55 and over.

Romantics: We still yearn for traditional romantic gestures such as a handwritten love letter, the study found

More than a third of us - 38 per cent - have fallen in love at work, but 16 per cent have felt unable to tell the object of their affection.

And 11 per cent of men admit having carried a torch for a friend’s wife or partner.

Psychologist Dr Gayle Brewer, of the University of Central Lancashire, said: 'It seems a lot of people spend time thinking about being a relationship with someone other than their partner.

'It’s very easy to romanticise what a relationship could be like.

'Perhaps it’s not surprising we might fall for people we work with as we see them daily and we usually see them on their best behaviour.

'We may also see friend’s partners when they are at their best - while out, dressed up and sociable, perhaps making an effort to be more humorous.

'But of course we all worry about the ramifications of falling for someone in the workplace, such as seeing them every day if we are rejected.

'With the partner of a friend or family member the ramifications could be even greater.

'This type of undeclared love could be upsetting and prevent a person from moving on and finding true happiness.'

The study, of 2,000 people, found that 12 per cent have sent a Valentine’s card or gift to someone other than their partner while in a relationship.

In addition, six per cent of men confess to sending themselves one just to make their wife or girlfriend jealous.

In contrast, 16 per cent of women have sent a card to a friend to cheer them up.

Michael Barringer, Marketing Director at Interflora, said: 'Technology plays an increasing role in the way we communicate but when it comes to saying "I love you" we prefer loved ones to take the traditional approach.

'Huge numbers meet through dating sites and use new media but it’s reassuring to hear we love to receive a handwritten note and still fall in love at first sight.

'It indicates we are a nation of romantics, even though the research suggests many have not yet felt able to tell the object of their desire how they really feel.

'It’s also fascinating to see how many people send Valentine’s cards and gifts to people other than their partners, such as to cheer up a friend.'
