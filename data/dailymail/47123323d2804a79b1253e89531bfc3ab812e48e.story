The Sound of Music may have come out almost half a century ago, but it seems our fascination with Maria and the Von Trapp family shows no signs of waning.

Some of the iconic costumes from the 1965 film - including the outfits Maria fashions out of old curtains - were snapped up at auction yesterday for a cool $1.3m (£845,000).

All seven children’s floral patterned green and white costumes were sold, alongside Maria’s ‘Do Re Mi’ dress, worn by Julie Andrews when she teaches the children how to sing.

The auction included the iconic brown dress (left) worn by Maria as she sang 'Do Re Mi' to the Von Trapp children (left), as well as lederhosen worn by the Von Trapp boys (right)

The scene in which Julie Andrews, as Maria, teaches the children how to sing on the mountains, using the song 'Do, Re, Mi' is one of the best known in the film

Consisting of a heavy brown homespun Austrian-style dress with wheat-colored blouse, the costume features 20th Century-Fox labels on the internal collar and waistband.

The children’s school uniforms from the beginning of the film were also sold, along with outfits worn during the climactic ‘escape’ scene, where the family cross over the mountains into Switzerland.

The film, which won five Oscars in 1966, gave us classic Rodgers and Hammerstein  songs like ‘Edelweiss’ and ‘My Favorite Things’ and made Julie Andrews a superstar.

Julie said in a 2012 interview with Oprah that, while filming, she had no idea the impact the film would have, confessing: ‘It made my career. It was that big [of] a movie.’

As well as the grey school uniforms worn at the start of the film, the auction included the full set of outfits (pictured) made by Maria and worn by the Von Trapp children throughout the film

The story, of a vivacious young women helping to heal a family through music, set during the drama of the Second World War, has stood the test of time

The film tells the story of spirited young nun who brings together seven motherless children and their stern father through the power of music, before all of them are forced to flee from the invading Nazis.

Sickly sweet to some, the film was given a lukewarm reception by critics when it was released, yet captured the hearts of generations of children. 

It was a huge success at the box office when it came out, earning nearly $300 million. 

As well as continuing to sell well on DVD, the musical, which opened on Broadway in 1959, is still popular across the world.

The story even spawned a reality show in recent years. In 'How do you solve a problem like Maria'  musical theatre wannabes auditioned for the part of Maria in a West End production.

The Sound of Music sale, by auction house Profiles in History, run by Joe Maddalena, was part of a Hollywood memorabilia sale which also saw the sale of a painting of Tara from Gone With The Wind, used in the film's opening sequence, for $270,000 (£175,000).
