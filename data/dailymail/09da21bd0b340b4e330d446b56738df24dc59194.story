Sam Burgess has excited Bath colleague Dave Attwood with how quickly he has adapted to rugby union.

Code-switcher Burgess will make his eagerly-awaited first start on Friday night when Bath take on Montpellier in the European Champions Cup at a sold-out Recreation Ground.

It will be an early acid test of how far the 25-year-old has come after just two substitute appearances, but England forward Attwood believes the former rugby league star is showing signs that he can live up to his huge billing.

‘Sam has come in and soaked everything up like a sponge,’ Attwood told Sportsmail. ‘He’s got a great opportunity and we’re all very excited to see what happens when he gets his hands on the ball. He’s a very physical specimen. He’s big, quick, holds on to the ball well and frees his arms up.

‘He has all the natural ability you would want to see, but the most exciting thing is his yearning to get better. We were walking off the pitch the other day and he was saying, “I can’t wait to get my first turnover in a ruck”. He’s well-spoken and down to earth. He doesn’t talk unnecessarily, but when he does talk he does so effectively.’

Burgess replaces Kyle Eastmond at inside centre in a game Bath must win to stand a chance of qualifying from Pool Four. Springbok flanker Francois Louw starts in the back row with Attwood at lock.

Yorkshireman Burgess shattered his cheekbone seconds into his last game of rugby league in October — when he inspired the South Sydney Rabbitohs to victory in the NRL Grand Final.

He has been eased into his new code with appearances off the bench against Harlequins a fortnight ago and Montpellier last week but Attwood believes that, in time, the big-money signing has the potential to break into the international set-up.

‘Let’s walk before we can run,’ said Attwood. ‘We’re still not sure where he’s going to end up playing but he’s done everything very well so far. Let’s support him and get him playing. If we can get that to bed together, then I’m sure he’s got all the attributes to succeed at international level.

‘Having guys like him around the Bath squad is beneficial to everyone: the young guys coming up and the old guys who have maybe put their feet up a little bit.’

Bath forwards coach Neal Hatley added: ‘We have to take a leap of faith and increase Sam’s game-time to see how quickly he is grasping the game.

‘But if his training is anything to go by he is really getting to grips with it. We couldn’t have had a more willing student.’
