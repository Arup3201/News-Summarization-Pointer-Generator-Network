Heroic New York cops lunged and grabbed a man possibly about to jump off the Verrazano Bridge Monday morning.

The man was distraught over being unemployed and found his way onto the ledge of the span after parking his van in traffic and climbing over a railing, officials said.

Dramatic footage shows the man peering over the edge of the bridge and down at the water over 200 feet below.

Another victim of the recession: The man was ready to end his life because he is unemployed and unable to find a job, police said

Multiple officers tethered to the bridge are shown talking to the disturbed man as he contemplates ending his life.

The unidentified man told officers that he was upset over being unable to find a job to feed his family, authorities said.

The man suddenly turned and looked at the water below, that’s when officers moved in.

Two cops grabbed the suicidal man by his arms and overpowered his attempts to break free.

A safety harness was soon attached to the would-be jumper and he was forced off the bridge and onto a ladder up to waiting emergency personnel.

The upper deck of the Brooklyn-bound side of the bridge was closed to traffic for about an hour Monday morning as the tense scene unfolded.

He was taken to a local hospital for observation, police said.

The bridge is notorious for suicide jumpers, with over a dozen attempts in just the past two years, according to the Staten Island Advance.

People taking their life on the span has become such a concern that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the bridge, has installed suicide prevention signs reading ‘Life is worth living’ with the phone number 1-800-LIFENET.
