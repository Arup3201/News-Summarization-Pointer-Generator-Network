A Facebook user has alleged that a photo of him kissing his husband - which was posted to the Duggar family's Facebook page in the wake of a photo challenge they offered online - was taken down and he was blocked from commenting on the page.

John M. Becker made the allegations on Facebook and on the website Bilerico.com on Tuesday, multiple media outlets noted.

The challenge was posted online five days after Jessa Duggar, who is featured on the family's TLC program '19 Kids and Counting,' put on Instagram a black-and-white photo of her in a liplock with husband Ben Seewald on November 5.

Dare: On Facebook, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar included this photo of themselves kissing, in a recreation of an earlier photo their daughter Jessa took with her husband Ben Seewald

Original: Jessa Duggar married Ben Seewald and posted this photo of them kissing on November 5 

'It's great living life with your best friend! @ben_seewald' she wrote on the social media site.

On November 10, the Duggar Family Official page featured a photograph of her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, smooching in a recreation of the newlyweds' photograph.

They wrote online 'God designed marriage to be a loving, dynamic relationship between a husband and wife for a lifetime. God loves marriage and it is supposed to be full of love, joy, fun and romance. Marriage is where romance belongs!

'Recently, Ben & Jessa received some criticism for posting a kissing picture. We are so grateful they waited to share their first kiss until after marriage. We’ve been married 30 years and are still in love! We had fun trying to duplicate Ben and Jessa's happily married kissing picture. We challenge all married couples to take a happily married picture and post it here:'

On Belerico.com, Becker linked to words he wrote on Facebook about his snap with husband Michael Knappen.

He wrote, 'Oh no, I think I've been banned from the Duggar Family Official Facebook page! (I'm crying into my coffee cup right now, I assure you.'   

Discrimination? John Becker, left, says he posted this photo of him kissing his husband Michael Knappen, right, to the Duggars' Facebook page as part of their challenge - but that it was removed and he was blocked 

'It was getting lots of likes, but the Duggars must not have liked it very much -- they pulled it down and blocked me from posting, liking, or commenting on the page altogether,' he also wrote in his post. 'How sad that they feel so threatened by other loving marriages!'

Becker alleged on Bilerico.com that '[The Duggars] started yanking photos of same-sex couples kissing and banning the people who posted them, myself included. It's their page, of course, so they have every right to do that.'

A TLC spokesman declined to comment to E! News.

As of this writing, the Duggars' photo challenge post on Facebook has over 6,100 comments. Those currently include photos of heterosexual and same-sex couples kissing.

Many comments on the page, however, show Facebook users debating homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

In a humorous twist, multiple commenters have shown themselves kissing random objects.

There is also a photo up of a man kissing a plastic Godzilla toy, calling it his 'lifelong love,' and another showing a different man with a pizza, which he refers to as his 'first love.'

Several users have included photos of them about to kiss their cats. A woman also has a snap up showing her kissing a container of Tide Pods.

TLC did not immediately return to a request for comment from MailOnline.
