The rain might have been lashing down but reclusive heiress Athina Onassis was pretty in a pink silk frock as she attended the wedding of her half-sister Sandrine.

Despite the inclement weather, the 28-year-old shipping heiress appeared relaxed and happy as she sheltered under an umbrella with husband Álvaro de Miranda Neto.

Onassis, who married husband Álvaro in 2005 is the only surviving heir of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, and the only child of his daughter Christina.

Pretty: Athina Onassis was elegant as she arrived at her sister's wedding with husband Álvaro de Miranda Neto

Beautiful: Sister Sandrine, 26, was a stunning bride in her white lace gown and priceless diamond earrings

Sister Sandrine is daughter of Athina's father Thierry Roussel and his second wife, Marianne Landhage.

In her white lace gown, complete with a romantic sweetheart neckline, Sandrine, 26, was a beautiful bride and smiled as she made her way into the church.

In her hand, she carried a pretty bunch of delicate cream and pale pink roses, and wore her hair pinned up into an elegant low bun.

The church, in the tiny village of Villeny, is close to the Roussel's Bonneville estate in the northern French departement of Salogne and also played host to the marriage of Sandrine's parents.

Family: The tiny church in the village of Villeny was also used by Sandrine's parents Thierry and Marianne

Luxury: Following the nuptials, Sandrine and her new husband were driven off in a vintage Rolls Royce

Bedraggled: Athina and the other bridesmaids were forced to take shelter in the porch because of the rain

Onassis was also a bridesmaid on that occasion and she appeared happy to play second fiddle to her sister as she smiled and waved on her way into the church.

After the nuptials, the newly married couple were driven off in a vintage black Rolls Royce decked with pink and white ribbons.

Onassis, who is believed to be close to her half siblings and stepmother, is rarely seen in public, preferring to live a quiet life in Brazil's largest city Sao Paulo with her husband.

Her 40-year-old spouse is a successful showjumper and Athina has also made inroads into the sport, but was forced to take a brief sabbatical after suffering a spinal injury in September last year.

Since then, Onassis, who is widely believed to be a billionaire, has staged a return to showjumping and most recently competed at a tournament in Italy earlier this month.

Rainy: Athina didn't appear to be too enamoured with the chilly wet weather and had to shelter under a brolly

Damp: Despite the inclement weather in Villeny, the ancient village church was picture-perfect
