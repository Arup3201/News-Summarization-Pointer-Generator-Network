Offensive post: Prison officer Michael Allred

A high-ranking corrections officer has been sacked after joking on Facebook that he had been 'groped' by  guards during a tour of prisons.

Former state trooper Michael Allred had accompanied his boss, the secretary of the Maryland Department of Public Safety Stephen Moyer, on a tour of prison facilities in Jessup, Maryland on Wednesday.

Later that day he posted on Facebook: 'Visiting the prisons ... haven't been groped this much since the flight on the honeymoon ... and this is just the guards!'

Incredibly Allred tagged both his boss Moyer, and 'Maryland House of Correction' in the post which quickly circulated among other prison officers.

A statement  posted on the Department of Correctional Services website confirmed that Allred had been dismissed for 'inappropriate comments made on social media'.

Allred had been hired in December as a police liaison with the state's government StateStat accountability program. 

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said in a statement that the union believed Moyer took the right course of action in terminating Allred's employment.

'AFSCME members believe that Michael Allred's social media comments were inappropriate and insulting to 7,200 Maryland correctional officers,' AFSME said in a statement.

'The secretary has the utmost respect for correctional officers and requires all employees to respect the department, their authority, and their peers,' the department said on its website. 

'He holds employees to the highest professional standards and expects them to act in a professional manner.'

Allred could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening.
