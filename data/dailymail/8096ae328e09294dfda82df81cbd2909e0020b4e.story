A U.S. congressman shot a lion while on safari in Zimbabwe and then ate it for dinner.

Republican Paul Broun, who represents Georgia's 10th Congressional District, told a conservative magazine: 'If I kill it, I'm gonna eat it.'

Mr Broun made the unusual admission in National Review Online, adding: 'The lion wasn’t particularly tasty, it was kind of chewy, but I ate it.'

Stuffed and mounted: The lion Rep. Broun killed during a hunt in Zimbabwe is moved into his congressional office

Broun, a medical doctor, told the political newspaper Roll Call in 2010 that his big kill came that year in Zimbabwe.

'After eating this animal, the natives called me Boss Shumba, which means Boss Lion,' he boasted.

'They’d never seen a guy come and actually eat a lion.'

But the lawmaker said he preferred the warthog he once hunted, saying, 'it’s actually pork.'

'I had roast warthog,' he said. 'It was 
cooked in a French style. I’m a French cook myself, and I like to cook 
things with some fancy sauces and stuff that I’ll make at home. That was
 excellent.'

Broun didn't say whether he ate parts of a bear he shot, whose stuffed body also has a place of honor in hits office.

He began his political career as a 
volunteer lobbyist for Safari Club International, working on the big 
game hunting group's efforts to oppose gun-control measures.

Now he's gearing up to run for the US Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Saxby Chambilss.

Broun is known in Washington for his strict fiscal conservatism - he introduced a balanced-budget amendment in the House of Representatives this week - and for his colorful embrace of fundamentalist Christianity, including a belief in creationism.

In September 2012 he spoke at the Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman's Banquet in Hartwell, Georgia, insisting that 'all that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell. And it's lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.'

'You see, there are a lot of 
scientific data that I've found out as a scientist that actually show 
that this is really a young Earth,' Broun continued, speaking in front 
of a wall 
covered with finished taxidermy projects

'I
 don't believe that the Earth's but about 9,000 years old. I believe it 
was created in six days as we know them. That's what the Bible says.'

The restaurant's owner tried to capitalize on the World Cup's African focus in 2010 by serving wild game from African safaris. Rep. Paul Broun (R) ate lion in Zimbabwe that same year after he killed the animal on safari

In the same speech, Broun reminisced about his lion hunt.

“God directed that bullet,' he said, 'because if I’'d missed, that lion would have been in the back of the truck with me and I'd have been clawed to death.'

Not surprisingly, Broun has nothing kind 
to say about President Barack Obama, once tweeting during a State of the
 Union address that Obama believes in socialism.

Rep. Paul Broun tweeted an insult during Barack Obama's State of the Union address in 2011, which he watched from his office instead of the House floor

Broun watched the speech from his Capitol Hill office instead of attending in person with the rest of Congress.

Broun
 told WSB radio in Atlanta that he 'was the first Member of Congress to 
call him a socialist who embraces Marxist-Leninist policies like 
government control of health care and redistribution of wealth,' The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

He also compared the president to Adolph Hitler and Karl Marx in 2008.
