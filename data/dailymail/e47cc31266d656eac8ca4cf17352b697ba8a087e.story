At more than four times the size of the average football pitch and around the same length it is little wonder it can move, let alone carry 18,000 20ft steel containers laden with cargo halfway around the world.

But the world's largest cargo ship proved that small and nippy is not always best when it comes to getting from A to B.

The Maersk Triple E set off on its maiden voyage last month and has now visited six different Asian ports on its 23 day route around Asia and Europe.

And a fascinating time lapse video shows the giant container vessel in action, making its first point of call at Busan in South Korea.

The video shows the ship gliding through the water towards the dock and being moored using heavy duty ropes.

The giant vessel dwarfs cars and workers on the dock as the ship's crew look over the side  of the ship all the way down to dry land.

The video then shows cargo containers being loaded neatly row upon row by automated cranes before the ship sets sail again.

Eventually there will be 20 of the Triple E ships produced and they will sail on the world's biggest shipping route between China and Holland in 23 days stopping at eight ports in Asia and another six in Europe.

The fleet is called the Triple E because its manufacturers claim it refers to the boat's economy of scale, energy efficiency and its 'environmental improvement proficiency'.

The company will save around £750,000 on fuel in a typical journey between Shanghai and Rotterdam.

The ship is designed for maximum storage and efficiency rather than speed.

Instead of a streamlined hull, the boat is more boxy so that it can carry more cargo and features a special engine that recycles heat and uses it to gain extra propulsion.

It is also the greener option when it comes to transporting a range of goods across the world - it produces just 3g CO2 per ton of cargo compared to an airplane which emits 560g per ton.

The ship, which has cargo space the equivalent of 36,000 cars or 111 million pairs of trainers, would be longer than the Eiffel Tower if the famous Parisian landmark was laid flat.
