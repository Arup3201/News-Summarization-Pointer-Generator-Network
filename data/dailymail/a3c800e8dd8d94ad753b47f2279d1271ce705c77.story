Paris St-Germain and Brazil defender Thiago Silva has lamented his side's lack of concentration and consistency this season. 

Les Parisiens are third in Ligue 1, four points behind leaders Lyon, following a 4-2 win over Evian on Sunday at the Parc des Princes.    

Silva told reporters: 'The side struggles to play well for the full 90 minutes

'Against Bastia we didn't play well after the half-time break. This time, it was before half-time. It's clearly a problem of concentration. We aren't playing as well as last season.'

He added: 'We are all discussing the problem to find a solution.'

PSG had been tipped to retain the Ligue 1 title comfortably this season after last year's runners-up AS Monaco sold off key players such as James Rodriguez to work within new financial constraints. 

Instead, they find themselves trailing Lyon and Marseille, despite having finished 28 and 29 points respectively ahead of them last term.

Laurent Blanc says that his side are 'very average in certain departments' 

Head coach Laurent Blanc suggested that his team 'were very average in certain departments' after the game with Evian, which meant they 'couldn't dominate the match entirely, like we used to do last season.

'But we won, and that's the main thing, because victory was imperative. We need to be more clinical in front of goal, more aggressive. We sometimes looked for the easy option against a very good Evian side.'
