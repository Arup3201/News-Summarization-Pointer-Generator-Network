A double decker bus with 56 college students on board which crashed into a field in Dorset today was being driven by a driver who was learning the route.

The driver of the bus was being monitored by an experienced colleague when the bus careered off the road and overturned in a field on the A350.

An investigation is under way to establish what caused the vehicle to veer off the road.

Overturned: A double-decker bus crashed in Dorset with 56 schoolchildren on board

A spokesman for Dorset police said it was 'amazing' the 56 students on board all survived, as only six people on the bus sustained 'minor injuries'.

Sergeant Joe Pardey, from Dorset 
police traffic department, said: 'We are still investigating what the 
cause of this incident was.

'When you see double-decker bus on 
it's side thoughts go through your mind about what could have happened 
but it is amazing that the passengers sustained only minor injuries.

'It's very, very lucky that no one was more seriously hurt but the students did remarkably well and were calm and collected.'

Emergency crews were called to the 
A350 between Upton and Lytchett in Poole shortly after 8.15am after 
reports that the bus had overturned into a field.

Dorset Police have said that six people involved, including the driver and five students, sustained 'minor injuries'.

The First Group bus, registered to Plymouth in Devon, was heading to Kingston Maurward College in Dorchester.

The driver lost control of the bus which careered off the 50mph road, ploughed through a hedge and rolled down an embankment before landing on its side.

The passengers, all aged between 16 and 18, were flung from their seats as the vehicle overturned.

Passing motorists pulled over and helped some of the shocked students out of the wreckage.

On hand: Fire and rescue services were on the scene and treated the three passengers and the driver for minor injuries

A fleet of ambulances and fire crews rushed to the scene and the six casualties were treated at the scene.

Most of them boarded a replacement bus which took them on to the college.

Inspector
Neil Leat, of Dorset Police, said: 'At about 8.15am the double-decker 
coach overturned and landed in the field, the cause of which is part of 
an ongoing investigation.

'Six
people were taken to hospital with non-life threatening or non-life 
changing injuries and were part of a group that were treated at the 
scene by paramedics.

'It's incredible that the majority of these young people appear to be fine after what has happened.'

One student said: 'I have never been so scared in my life. I feel so lucky to be alive and would like to thank the kind men who helped us escape.'

The road was temporarily closed between Limberlost, the Upton bypass and Vine’s Farm Shop.

A spokesman for the South Western Ambulance Service said: 'The bus was carrying students on their way to a local college.

'The Trust committed a number of ambulances to the scene and a total of six casualties have been taken to Poole Hospital.

'None of the casualties is thought to
be in a life-threatening condition. There are also a number of patients
thought to be walking wounded and they were treated by ambulance 
clinicians at a location near to where the incident occurred.'

No other vehicles were believed to have been involved.

Student Jade Elizabeth said: 'I can’t tell you how scared I was.

'It was terrifying. As the bus was tipping I thought it was a dream, but when I got to the ground all covered in glass, I thought, that’s it I’m going to die.'

Georgie Davis, 18, an agriculture student from Poole, was at the back of the bus and described it as the worst moment of her life when it suddenly flipped.

'We went flying - people were going everywhere. We were hanging on for dear life. It was absolutely awful. As it turned I went to stand up and a women came flying past me and elbowed me in the ribs.

'There was a girl with learning disabilities next to me and she was scared out of her wits.

'I ended up standing on the window with a bush underneath and it started to give way so I grabbed hold of the metal and was holding on for dear life.'

She said she saw a passenger with cuts to his hand, another woman was treated by the air ambulance after suffering a panic attack.

'It could have been so much worse. I don't want to think about how much worse it could have been.'

A First Hampshire and Dorset spokesman said: 'The vehicle involved in this morning’s incident was a double deck bus being operated by our First Hampshire and Dorset team under contract to Kingston Maurward College. 

'It was fitted with CCTV and this will be viewed as part of the investigation into what happened.

'Typically local buses such as these do not have seat belts and there is no legal requirement for them to do so.

'As a company focused on safety we employ a number of systems to ensure that our passengers and employees remain as safe as possible while on board our vehicles. 

'Our drivers are thoroughly trained, and we also employ a real-time system on our buses which both encourages the safest driving styles and monitors performance.

'While clearly there has been a serious incident this morning, the cause of which is being investigated, we would like to take this opportunity to remind people that buses remain one of the safest forms of transport in the UK and incidents, such as that which has occurred today, are incredibly rare.

'Our thoughts continue to be with those students who were travelling on the bus this morning and their friends and family. We have been in contact with the college and have offered to help in any way possible.'
