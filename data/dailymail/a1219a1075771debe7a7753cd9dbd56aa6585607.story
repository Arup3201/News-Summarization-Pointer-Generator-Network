A blind schoolgirl whose growth has been stunted by a rare condition can now get around thanks to a specially made mini cane.

At just 34 inches tall, five-year-old Lexi Drake struggled to get by using even the smallest of white sticks because they were too big for her.

But her life has now been transformed thanks to the custom-made cane.

Lexi Drake, five, had Turner syndrome which causes short stature and infertility. She also has a brain tumour which caused her to lose her sight when she was two years old

Lexi has Turner syndrome – a chromosomal abnormality which only affects girls and is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome.

She is also blind as a result of suffering from a brain tumour which damaged the nerves in her eyes.

Lexi, from Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, is one of just three known people in the world to suffer from the combination of Turner syndrome and a brain tumour.

But she is adapting to life with her new 24 inch cane and started school in September.

Her mother Anna, 25, said: ‘Most people moan if they have a headache and are struggling to get out of bed. But whatever she is faced with, she gets on with.

‘She’s happy and smiley and full of energy. She’s always caring about everybody else.

Lexi (pictured with her mother, Anna, and her mother's partner, James Bowler) was unable to have an off-the-shelf white cane as they are too long so a custom-made one was flown over from Canada for her

‘You hope for the best and I just take every day as it comes. The tumour hasn’t grown back since her treatment.’

Ms Drake, a mother-of-three,  said: ‘She had a cane which was the smallest they had in the country, but it was still too big for her and that didn’t even have the ball on it.

‘I had to get this one with the ball made for her in Canada. Since then, she has never looked back.

‘She uses it at school and she has grown with it really well.

‘She got it when she was four - she was the smallest in the country to have a white cane.

Lexi (pictured learning to swim with her aunt, Chrissie Drake) is one of just three people in the world known to suffer from both Turner syndrome and a brain tumour

‘I think now the blindness is part of Lexi. I would love her to wake up and say I can see but it is absolutely part of Lexi.

‘She has adapted to it so well. She doesn’t let her it get her down and she has lots of friends at school. She will talk to anybody.’

Lexi was diagnosed with Turner syndrome at her mother's 15 week scan.

The syndrome means she has part, or all, of one X chromosome missing.

Sufferers can experience a range of physical problems as a result, including small stature and infertility.

She also developed a rare brain 
tumour, called craniopharyngioma, in 2010 and had to have keyhole 
surgery to reduce the size of it.

But it was unsuccessful and in March 2011 she travelled to America to receive pioneering treatment.

Lexi (pictured in hospital with her aunt, Karen Grob) had to have keyhole surgery to remove her brain tumour. When this failed, she went to the U.S. for pioneering radiotherapy

Four metal screws were inserted into her head for six weeks while she underwent Proton Beam Therapy, a form of radiotherapy suited to tumours buried deep in the brain and spine because it causes less damage to healthy tissue.

The treatment involved gruelling sessions, five days a week for 45 minutes, while the tumour was zapped with radiation to reduce its size.

However, the treatment caused her to suffer strokes.

‘She will need heart surgery because 
she has a narrowing of the aorta but that will probably be when she is 
about 10 years old,’ Ms Drake, who lives with partner James Bowler, 25, 
added.

‘At the moment she is doing quite well with the tumour.

‘She has regular scans every three to four months to look out for her health and any potential problems.

‘She’s on growth hormone and in the last six months she has grown six centimetres.’

Ms Drake says she wants Lexi to be independent and to feel she is no different to any other children

Lexi still has to undergo MRI scans to look for tumour regrowth, as well as scans to monitor her blood vessels to prevent any potential strokes.

One of Lexi’s doctors from Birmingham Children’s Hospital praised her bravery throughout her ordeal.

Martin
 English, consultant paediatric oncologist at Birmingham Children’s 
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘There are only three cases of the 
combined craniopharyngioma and Turner conditions reported in the world 
and Lexi is one of those.

‘She has coped incredibly well. Many young children cope better with blindness than adults as they don’t know differently.

‘She has undergone three lots of 
surgery at the children’s hospital in Birmingham, been to America and 
Great Ormond Street as well.

‘She’s
 a real star. She is incredible she recognises nearly all the staff that
 look after her just by the sound of their voices.’

Lexi (pictured with her sister, Natalia) will also need heart surgery when she is about ten as she has narrowing of her aorta

Ms Drake continued: ‘I want her to succeed in everything that she does and to be happy. That is what any parent would want and to know that they have had a good childhood and to be at peace.

‘We try to give her independence. She understands that she is blind and she can’t see and she will say I can see with my hands and my cane can help me see where I am going.

‘In a way I am protective in that I am watchful but I let her do things herself to give her independence. I am trying to make her feel that she is not any different to the others.’

A spokesperson for Vista, the charity that made Lexi’s cane, said she has taken to using it naturally.

They said: ‘Lexi, she was a natural, she took hold of the cane and off she went. I am sure the positive attitude of her family helped, but Lexi is an inspiration.’

Turner syndrome affects about one in every 2,000 female babies and no cure is currently known.

Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects women.

It is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome and affects about one in every 2,000 baby girls.

Babies normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes including one pair which determine the baby's sex. These are known as the sex chromosomes.

One sex chromosomes comes from the father and the other from the mother - the mother's is always an X chromosome, the father's can be an X or Y.

A baby girl normally has XX and a boy has XY.

In Turner syndrome, the Y is missing so the child is always a girl.

The child also has part, or all, of one X chromosome missing meaning she has just one complete X chromosome rather than two.

Most children with the condition are shorter than average and have underdeveloped ovaries.

This means they are infertile and do not have periods.

Some girls with the condition also have heart, kidney and thyroid problems.

Turner syndrome is often not diagnosed until puberty as height and the lack of periods are the main symptoms.

There is no cure for the condition but most people with it live a relatively normal life and their life expectancy is unaffected.

@highlight

Lexi Drake was born with Turner syndrome - a chromosomal abnormality which only affects girls and causes short stature and infertility

@highlight

When she was two she was also diagnosed with a brain tumour

@highlight

The tumour caused her to lose her sight and meant she required surgery in the UK as well as advanced radiotherapy treatment in the U.S.

@highlight

She is only 34ins tall so is too short for an off-the-shelf white cane

@highlight

She is now able to move around by herself thanks to a specially made cane
