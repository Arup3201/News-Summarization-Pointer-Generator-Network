Phoenix Triton King (pictured) was arrested along with the unidentified girl

A man and a 16-year-old girl are on the loose in Northern California after shooting two transients, one fatally, with a crossbow.

Deputies responded to a report of an injured man on the side of a road in Eureka around 12:30 p.m. Sunday, Humboldt County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Morey said.

They found the 41-year-old male victim suffering from three crossbow injuries. He was treated and released at a hospital.

Morey identified the male suspect as 20-year-old Phoenix Triton King. The girl's identity was not released.

The second victim, a 44-year-old man, was found dead nearby. He had suffered a single arrow shot to the face.

Neither victim has been identified.

Morey says it appears King and the girl, also transients, suspected the two men had stolen from their transient camp.
