A teenage girl has sold her brand new dream Jeep so she could buy her friend a vehicle in an astonishing act of generosity and kindness.

Chandler Lacefield, 17, gave up her red car, which had been a graduation gift, to buy two smaller cars, so both she and her best friend MacKenzie Sterner, also 17, could have freedom.

The girls met at Weatherford High School, Texas in March and bonded over a love of running, cheer-leading and fishing - but Sterner soon became reliant on her friends as her mother could not afford to buy her a car.

After school finished for the year, Miss Sterner got a summer job but struggled with transport to and from her work at The Pizza Place, relying on her mother who also needed to drive to work.

She told NBCDFW.com she never knew how she was going to get home.

Coming to the rescue, her best friend Miss Lacefield came up with a plan. After spending time in Bali in June, on a mission trip, Miss Lacefield said the idea came to her.

She told the news agency God told her to do something big.

Keeping it a surprise, Miss Lacefield first asked her mother if she could sell her new Jeep to buy two smaller cars.

Then, once approved, she texted Miss Sterner's mother Angel Martin for her consent, and got an enthusiastic reply. 'I AM ABOUT TO EXPLODE,' Martin texted back.

'We finally talked on the phone, and I was still shocked,' she added to NBCDFW. 'She goes, "It's something I feel strongly about." She was so sweet and selfless.'

The kind teen began shopping around for somewhere to exchange her Jeep for two smaller cars.

At first, few car dealers would help her because of her age, reported NBCDFW.com, but eventually she was able to purchase a 2002 Acura MDX for her friend and a 2011 BMW 328 for herself.

Her parents had to take an additional loan to cover her own car.

The cars bought, Miss Lacefield finally unveiled her big surprise to her friend on Saturday.

She told her friend she had a surprise, before taking her, eyes closed, to the bow-wrapped vehicle.

'Everyone had cameras in my face and finally someone was like, "That's yours". And I started crying. It was awesome,' she told NBCDFW.com

Miss Lacefield said thinking back to that moment fills her with joy. 'I was just glad she loved it. I'm glad I did it. I don't regret it at all. I know it's the right choice I made,' she told the news service.

The girls have now returned to education - Miss Sterner is back at Weatherford High School, studying and cheer-leading, and Miss Lacefield has started at Weatherford College. She hopes to attend Texas A&M.
