 MI5 is advertising for a new head of health and safety – but it cannot give any details about the role. 

The £60,000 a year job is based mainly in London and offers ‘interesting challenges when it comes to health and safety’. 

But potential applicants are not told much else. 

Hush-hush: MI5 are advertising for a new head of health and safety but can reveal very little about the £60,000 a year role

‘We can’t show you the buildings,’ the job description declares.

‘We can’t talk about the people you’ll work with. We can’t tell you much about the job. We can’t give you the exact locations. We can’t mention the kind of technology involved...

‘Our work is often covert and our equipment classified.’

The Home Office said: ‘The security service works within the law —including health and safety laws — and needs people with a variety of different skills in a wide number of roles.’
