A Florida man was hospitalized after he crashed his remote-controlled plane this morning.

The unidentified man was flying the radio-controlled jet as part of the Florida Jets RC Air Show in Lakeland in Polk County. 

It crashed into Paradise Field near the runway at Linder Regional Airport.

The remote-controlled jet that crashed on Friday in Lakeland, Florida, is 'similar to one of these in size'

 The jet crashed into Paradise Field at Linder Regional Airport during the Florida Jets RC Air Show this morning

Fog stopped the man from going to Tampa General Hospital so he was was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital

The man suffered non-life threatening injuries, but was severely burned during the crash, according to 10 News. 

When the aerial enthusiast's three-foot, $20,000 plane crashed near him, some of its fuel sprayed out and caused the burns.  

Polk Fire Rescue originally wanted to fly the injured man to Tampa General Hospital, but there was too much fog for the medical chopper to navigate.

The man was taken to Lakeland Regional Hospital instead. 

Although the accident was originally reported as an actual plane crash, that notion was dispelled. 

The Florida Jets Air Show is not a competition, but more of a 'fly-In, or Jet-Together', according to its Facebook page from last year. 

The page reads: 'Florida Jets is one of the most exciting R/C Aviation events on the planet.

'FJ features the ultimate technology in airframe construction and power plant, and has the highest level of pilot proficiency of any radio control model aviation discipline.'

There were some initial reports that a plane had crashed, but Sgt Gross quickly cleared up the confusion

Although this mishap might seem out of the ordinary, it is more common than you might think. 

Remote-controlled planes crash frequently enough that there is a webpage about it. 

The No. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error, according to R/C Airplane World. 

According to the site: 'Either the pilot is flying beyond his or her abilities, or flying a plane that's too advanced or simply unsuitable for his/her level of experience. 

'Or perhaps they make a genuine mistake because of, say, disorientation - even experienced rc pilots make the wrong stick movements sometimes!

'Equipment failure is another reason. In fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure!  

'Flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes, especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges!

'Prevention is better than cure, but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future.'
