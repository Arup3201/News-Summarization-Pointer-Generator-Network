A former Russian soldier is suing government officials after they refused to issue him a passport as a woman.

Angry Jury Ovodov, 49, had been turned down on the grounds that he had not had a sex change operation and was still physically a man.

Now he is taking the passport service in Ekaterinburg to court claiming that he's been discriminated against because he is not wealthy.

Ovodov said, 'I can't afford the medical bills for the operations.'

'But that doesn't mean they can deny me my right to be a woman.'

He now wants to be known as Julia Solovleva.

Ovodov says officials are preventing him from expressing himself freely.

'I am a woman inside. It's just the lack of money that's stopping me,' he said.

Point of contention: The Russian passport currently only accepts male or female as possible genders

In Australia, they have come up with a compromise to accommodate such a disagreement.

From July, Australians could register as 'intersex' on their passports.

Like Ovodov, people do not need to have completed a sex change to be eligible for the third gender option.Â
