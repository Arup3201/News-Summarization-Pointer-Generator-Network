A video of a middle-aged University of Alabama fan-mom jumping into a group of young male University of Oklahoma fans at the Sugar Bowl on Thursday has quickly become a sensation online, garnering over a million views in just 18 hours.

When the video was first released, the audio was covered with music leaving the nature of the fight a mystery.

But in the hours since the fight, the woman at the center of the video has stepped forward as Sweet Water, Alabama resident Michelle Pritchett and both she and the college student she kicked in the chest, Oklahoma junior Michael Connolly, have shared their sides of the story online.

Penalty! A University of Alabama fan mom got into a fight with a rowdy group of young Sooners fans at the Sugar Bowl on Friday. The video of the kicking attack has garnered over a million views in just just a day

The video picks up just as Mrs Pritchett walks across the aisle at the New Orleans Superdome to confront the group of young Sooner fans.

She gets up in the face Connolly, going so far as to touch his face. At one point a man who appears to be her husband comes and grabs her away but she soon turns around and leaps head first into the group. When they try to hold her down she starts bicycle kicking everyone around her.

Eventually stadium security come up and grab her away and kick her out of the stadium.

Mrs Pritchett told Yellowhammer.com that the video makes it look like she's the bad guy, but there's a deeper story which motivated her actions.

 'What I did was probably not the thing to do. But they were taunting us. They began by going after me. But then they crossed the line and started taunting my 16-year-old son,' she said.

So she went over to the Oklahoma side and asked the men to 'leave her son out of it'

She said their rivalry banter started off friendly but escalated when they tried picking a physical fight with their son.

'I said, "no, that's not going to happen. This crap needs to stop."'

That's when her husband pulled her away from the group the first time. It was when one of the men called her a 'stupid b****' while she was leaving that she snapped and jumped into the rowdy crowd.

She says that the security guards had already warned that group about throwing bottles so when they escorted her out of the stadium, they said she shouldn't be worried about the college boys pressing charges. She believes if security had just kicked them out when they started throwing bottles originally, the incident would have never happened.

Oklahoma Junior Michael Connolly gave a slightly different version of events to Sports Illustrated's Extra Mustard.

He says Mrs Pritchett and her family were the first to talk smack at the beginning of the game when Alabama was winning.

When Oklahoma took control of the field, he agrees that he and his friends got a little rowdy and started yelling anti-Alabama remarks in the family's general direction. Because she was the only one standing in her section, he believes she felt singled out.

At one point one of his friends yelled: 'Bama fans, I yell "Roll Tide" when I eff my cousin.'

One of their comments caused her son to try and pick a fight with them and they told him: 'No come down here'.

On his Twitter, Connolly even captured Mrs Pritchett flipping the group off moments before the attack.

That's when he says the video started. She came down into their section and started screaming at him and sticking her tongue out so he asked: 'Are you trying to make out with me?' and one of his friends started chanting 'Kiss her! Kiss her!'

'That’s when she walked away, and then jumped me. When she kicked me, it left giant boot marks on my shirt. I’m not sure if the guy restraining her was her husband or not—they weren’t sitting right next to each other—but she was kicked out of the game and her two daughters were crying,' Connolly said. As of late Friday night, Connolly claimed in a Tweet to have received an apology message from Mrs Pritchett.

Earlier, Mrs Pritchett's only concern seemed to be how the video would impact her Roll Tide team.

'I'm embarrassed. I love The Tide and I apologize to all the players and to Coach Saban and to the entire fan base. I'm sorry. Coach Saban's going to say "those crazy fans don't know hot to act." And I wasn't intoxicated either. I want people to know that. I'd had a couple of drinks, but I was not intoxicated.'

But as a mother, she knows where her real allegiances lie.

'I hate to say it, but I'd do it again if I had to. I'm not going to let anyone go after my son.'
