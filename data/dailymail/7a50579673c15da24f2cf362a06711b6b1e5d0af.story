Bournemouth will be 'rubbing their hands' at the prospect of facing Liverpool right now because the Reds are 'there for the taking', believes Jimmy Case.

The ex-Liverpool and Bournemouth midfielder is adamant that Eddie Howe's men will be confident they can catch Brendan Rodgers' side cold and cause an upset.

With the Cherries sitting top of the Championship table, their situation in stark contrast to that at Anfield but the two sides face each other in Wednesday's Capital One Cup quarter-final at Dean Court.

Liverpool are languishing in 10th place in the Premier League, lost to rivals Manchester United 3-0 on Sunday and have endured their worst start to a campaign since 1964-65.  

And that is a situation Case believes gives Bournemouth a great opportunity to cause an upset. Speaking on BBC Radio Solent, he said: ''If I was a Bournemouth fan I would be rubbing my hands

'Liverpool are there for the taking. I watch Liverpool every game.

'The lack of confidence within the side, the work ethic, there is a lot of work to do to get them back on track.'

Case scored 23 goals in 186 appearances for his hometown club Liverpool between 1973 and 1981 before netting once in 40 games later on in his career for Bournemouth.

And the 60-year-old former  midfielder believes all sides want a taste of Liverpool right now and that Howe has a team capable of defeating the Reds.

Bournemouth lost 2-0 when the clubs played in the FA Cup back in January but gave a good account of themselves. 

Howe continued: 'They all want to play Liverpool at the moment.

'I would fear for the Liverpool fans as Bournemouth are doing very well.

'Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has done a terrific job and it's going to be one hell of a tie.

'The team is a shadow of its former self from the one that won down there in January. If Bournemouth play like they did in January (in the FA Cup match) they will probably win this tie.'
