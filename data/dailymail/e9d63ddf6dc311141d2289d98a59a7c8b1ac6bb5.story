Dressed in seductive, vintage-inspired lingerie and a theatrical top hat burlesque star Dita is the perfect model for her latest range of Von Follies underwear.

It is hard to believe the petite dancer, who is famous for her love of lingerie, recently celebrated her 41st birthday.

Dita created the Von Follies underwear label in 2012, which is now stocked on ASOS.com and Debenhams.

Inspired by her own vintage wardrobe (she has been collecting underwear since she was just 16) and love of retro glamour the collection is designed to add some va va voom to real women's wardrobes.

The AW13 Sheer Witchery collection includes vampish black lace overlayed on nude satin, cathedral cuts and sheer mesh sections on the bra cups.

In the stunning pictures, Dita poses with ease showing off her favourite items from the range.

In one exclusive new image the raven-haired pin-up is seen showing off a bra, pants and garter belt worn with a shiny top hat and mesh opera length gloves.

In another, the showgirl lies back seductively on a plush bed against a mirror, as her reflection shoes off all her glorious curves cinched into a balconette bra as she wears high waisted knickers.

And in keeping with Dita's own aesthetic all of the new designs are available in complete sets with thong, brief, garter belt, bra and slip.

Dancer Dita admits that she has always been obsessed with lingerie.

In
 an interview with Vogue.co.uk she 
said: 'I like to surround myself with luxury and beauty all the time. 
I've been collecting vintage lingerie for 25 years - my collection is 
pretty huge now. I've always been fascinated by it, I used to sift 
through my mother's underwear drawer when I was young. I loved the idea 
of something that was feminine and functional.'

Her love of underwear 
eventually led to a career as a global sex symbol but although the 
American is famous for showing off her incredible body in nearly nude 
shows, she recently surprised her fans by admitting that even she gets 
shy sometimes.

In an interview with Bwatt magazine she explained that of course she has insecurities from time to time.

‘Just like everyone else, I am not always confident, I have all the same self-doubt,' she said.

‘I
 just try to love myself and accept things that I don’t like about 
myself and I think it’s something important for all women to know that 
we all have those feelings.’

She added: ‘Everyone has something 
about them that they wish they could change, everyone I know anyways, 
and it’s about learning to love those things too.’

Von Follies is available at Debenhams and ASOS.com in sizes 8-16 and 32B to 36DD
