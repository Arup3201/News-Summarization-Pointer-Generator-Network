The mayhem enveloping Blackpool is continuing apace as a feud between Karl Oyston and former assistant manager Bart De Roover was reignited on Tuesday.

De Roover left his post last week after refusing to sign a contract at Bloomfield Road - outspoken in slamming the way in which the underfire chairman runs the club. 

The breaking of promises regarding the playing budget and dilapidated training ground were central to his discontent.

Oyston opted to bite back a weekly column for the town’s newspaper, poking fun at the ex-coach despite the Seasiders becoming embroiled in a farcical situation whereby manager Jose Riga doesn’t know whether he is to be sacked or not.

‘It was interesting to see the comments made by Bart De Roover on his exit last week,’ Oyston penned.

‘I think sometimes in football when people don't get their own way they tend to make a disproportionate crisis of it and I think that's what Bart's done.

‘He knew exactly what he was coming to when he came and if he didn't, more fool him. The fact he's reacted the way he has after not getting his own way probably says a lot about him.’

De Roover attempted to keep his cool when speaking to Sportsmail and refused to become involved in a slanging match.

‘I’ve only just stopped laughing,’ the Belgian said. ‘It’s unbelievable. This is getting ridiculous now. Disrespectful is too nice a word. It’s beyond a joke.’

De Roover turned down a contract offer and wasn’t paid during his time on the Fylde Coast.

‘Karl Oyston doesn’t accept no for an answer,’ he added. ‘He promised everything would be improved but we saw nothing in two months.

‘I don’t know another chairman who reacts like that. You should work with your team and players, not against them.

‘I don’t want to stoop to that level. I respect the gaffer, the players and the fans too much.’

Oyston also asserted that De Roover’s natural coaching level was ‘the lower leagues in Belgium,’ adding that the club ‘back his sensible decision to return’.

That clearly irked the 47-year-old: ‘I’ve trained at the highest level in Belgium. I have got my Pro licence.’

Oyston is likely to sack Riga after Blackpool lost each of their opening six competitive fixtures this season, and had lined up Owen Coyle as his replacement.

That, however, looks increasingly problematic after serious disputes arose over a five-figure fee due to the Scot’s agent. Oyston is renowned for not paying intermediaries.

Riga took training on Monday and Tuesday before meeting the chairman for talks over his immediate future.

Oyston also took aim at the boss in his column, saying: 'I have to say I find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager.

'He has said, on many occasions on the record, that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have.

'The first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to Belgium for a week without telling anyone.'
