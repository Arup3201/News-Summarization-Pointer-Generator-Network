An astonishing public response has helped ensure more than 100 veterans and widows will be able to attend the royal unveiling of a national Bomber Command memorial after all.

Men who risked their lives flying in bombers during World War Two were disgusted to discover they had missed out on an invitation to the long-awaited ceremony because all tickets were taken.

But after the Daily Mail highlighted the case of 91-year-old Freddie Johnson, who was missing out despite flying 92 missions during five years of service, the response was overwhelming.

Relatives and other members of the public deservedly due to attend next Thursday’s unveiling in Green Park, London, returned their tickets so that the veterans who saw action could be there.

Others cancelled because they were physically unable to travel and had been made aware of the demand for seats.

The small group of organisers running the event – without any government help – made every effort to find a place for veterans who put their names on a waiting list.

Jim Dooley, head of fundraising for the RAF Bomber Command Memorial Fund, said there was ‘enough returns now to accommodate veterans and, more importantly, widows of those killed’.

Organisers have stressed that no more tickets will be available to late applicants not previously on the waiting list.

Despite the success in finding places for dozens of veterans, many more who would have liked to have received an invitation will still miss out.

Many families knew nothing about the need to apply for tickets until publicity highlighted the issue, or had been unable to make contact with organisers and gave up trying.

Eight senior members of the royal family – including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall – are due to attend the unveiling, along with around 6,500 ticket holders.

They will be there to remember the 55,573 airmen who lost their lives but were never given the formal recognition their efforts deserved.

The £6.5million memorial, which includes a sculpture of a bomber crew by artist Peter Jackson, is made from Portland stone and aluminium recovered from a Halifax aircraft.

Mr Johnson, a highly decorated rear gunner who fought through the war despite being shot down twice, was promised tickets after the Mail revealed his plight.

His daughter Mandy Stewart, 56, praised the Mail for successfully highlighting the ‘betrayal’ of veterans.

She said: ‘There has been an amazing reaction. The Mail’s articles have led to a huge public response, not only in the UK but in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. I was approached by someone who offered to give up their tickets for us.

‘We are very grateful to these kind people for such a wonderful gesture and grateful for the publicity. It has been a fantastic reaction.’

Tickets were also found for former navigator Tom Bennett, 93, who was once a decorated member of the Dambusters squadron.

A spokesman for the fund organisers thanked the ‘very kind’ people who give up their tickets and confirmed everyone on the official waiting list had been allocated a place.

She said: ‘The Memorial is a permanent, public monument to the bravery and sacrifice of those who served in Bomber Command.

'It will always provide a poignant place for people to pay their respects.’
