Middlesbrough are considering reviving interest in Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes this week.

The Championship promotion chasers lost ground after losing 3-0 to new leaders Bournemouth on Saturday.

Blackburn have insisted Rhodes is not for sale but defeat to Brighton yesterday has left their slim play-off chances hanging by a thread and Boro hope to persuade them to strike a deal for the Scotland international.

 25-year-old Rhodes has scored 16 goals in 38 appearances for Blackburn so far this season

Middlesbrough will try to strike a loan before Thursday's deadline with the view to a permanent £10 million transfer.

Derby County are also understood to be interested in the 23-year-old. 

Blackburn have an FA Cup quarter-final replay against Liverpool looming but Rhodes is ambitious to play in the Premier League and Boro could represent his best opportunity. His uncle Steve Agnew is also assistant manager to Aitor Karanka.

Rhodes has earned 11 international caps for Scotland since making his debut in November 2011
