Smiling into the camera, four-year-old Katerina looks like any proud child with her pet. 

But the little Russian girl, dubbed 'Mowgli' girl in fact owes her life to the Alsatian puppy after they got lost together in the Siberian wilderness - where she then survived for 12 days and nights.

Karina Chikitova became lost with her pet after following her father into a snowy Siberian forest full of wolves and bears in October last year.

Naida had been keeping Karina warm at night but after nine days returned home to summon help.

Rescuers found her footprint three days later next to a paw print near a river, where they had drunk water. So the emergency workers knew they were in the right area of the Sakha Republic, Russia's largest region and only slightly smaller than India.

Karina is now preparing for Christmas in her home in the far flung village of Kyachchi - hoping that Russian Santa, called Ded Moroz, will bring her a Barbie doll.

It was here that Karina's grandmother Emma revealed the child's first words to the dog after she returned from five weeks of hospital treatment after her ordeal.

'Why did you leave me?' she asked Naida.

'In fact, seeing the dog back in the village helped save her life,' according to The Siberian Times, who visited Karina in her remote home for the first picture of them together since their ordeal.

'Naida's appearance after nine days gave rescuers hope that Karina was still alive, even though the dog was not able to retrace her steps back to the child.'

The dog had also kept her warm at night in chilly temperatures. She was eventually found hungry, exhausted and covered in mosquito bites lying in a grassy hole.

This week Karina has a winter cold which stopped her playing outside in temperatures of minus 29 degrees - rather mild for the time of year in the Sakha Republic, the largest and coldest region in Russia.

'Soon they will bring a Christmas tree in from the forest,' said Karina, excited about the coming festivities which will be celebrated, Russian-style, at New Year.

She added: 'They'll put it inside the house and warm it up. And then I will decorate it with beautiful toys and candy wrappings.

'Then Ded Moroz will bring me a Barbie and a kitchen set, so I'll be playing with my friends.'

Search: Rescuers found Karina's footprint three days after Naida returned to the village - next to a paw print near a river where they had drunk water

Expanse: Emergency workers trawled through Russia's largest region, the Sakha Republic, which is only slightly smaller than India 

Drained: The young girl, who had survived for nearly two weeks on wild berries and river water, looked emaciated when rescuers found her among the scrubland

Freezing: Karina went missing in the woods near her village of Kyachchi which lies in the Sakha region - one of the coldest areas in Siberia

Courageous: Karina's doctor at the Children's Hospital in Yakutsk said she's a 'very strong girl' who's 'strong-willed character' helped her survive

Recovering: Karina will travel to a rehabilitation centre in her region's capital of Yakutsk, which is 770km away from her village

Before that, Karina has been invited to a festive party with the Head of Sakha Republic, Yegor Borisov, before undergoing more checks at a rehabilitation centre in regional capital Yakutsk - some 770km north-east of her remote village.

Karina's grandmother said her granddaughter survived because 'from an early age she got used to the harsh conditions of life in the taiga and is not scared of the forest'.

Adding that 'Naida helped too'.

The 40-year-old thanked people from all over the world, as far afield as New Zealand, who sent gifts to Karina after reading about her ordeal.

She said: 'We never thought we would find ourselves at the centre of the media attention. It was quite stressful.

'But it is incredibly heartwarming to realise that so many people know about us, talk about Karina, and even send presents. A huge thank you to everyone.'

Karina's mother, Talina, said: 'We are soon to leave to Yakutsk where Karina will stay for a bit at the rehabilitation centre.'

Then the girl will go to a party organised by the head of the Sakha government.

The 21-year-old added: 'After that, we'll come back and we'll celebrate the New Year at home.

'We will be making a traditional Olivier salad, and we will also cook traditional Yakut dishes - fried carp and a dish called Khart, which is boiled innards of foal.

'There will also be a dessert called Kuorchekh, which is whipped cream with cranberries.'

Karina's ordeal began after she followed her father Rodion into the forest as he left for a hunting trip.

He was unaware that his daughter and her dog had tailed him. Both Karina and Naida, who stayed with the little girl, became hopelessly lost in the forest.

Talina had been in the fields gathering hay when her daughter went missing and it took her several days to reach Rodion and discover that she was lost. A massive search began for the girl.

'Karina drank water from rivers and ate berries, but when she was found, she was badly undernourished,' reported The Siberian Times.

Freezing: The temperatures in Sakha Republic, where Karina lives and became lost in, can drop to lower than minus 30 degrees Celsius

Saving grace: Luckily for Karina, the night-time temperature when she became stranded in the woods was round six degrees Celsius

Her doctor at the City Children's Hospital, in Yakutsk, Fedora Gogoleva, said: 'The family live far away in a remote village, not in the city, and it makes its mark,' she said. 'She was raised close to nature.

'Certainly she went with grandmother and parents to the forest, to gather berries. Perhaps this is why she was not afraid of the forest.

'Karina herself is a very strong girl, has a strong-willed character. This probably helped her to survive.'

'The forest around Olom is full of bears,' said rescuer Albert Semyonov, who revealed his men needed armed guards in looking for Karina.

'Close to the gunners we felt somehow calmer. However, the thought of bears immediately switched to another concern: somewhere in the forest was this helpless child.'

The breakthrough came when rescuers found Karina's footprint on the bank of a river when she had gone to drink water.

Next to her print, was the paw mark of a dog. This gave rescuers hope they were in the right area, and next day found Karina.
