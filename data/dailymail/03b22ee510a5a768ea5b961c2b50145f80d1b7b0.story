A fraudster who received £90,000 in benefits by claiming he could not walk more than 60 metres was exposed when hidden cameras filmed him carrying heavy furniture while running a successful house-clearance business.

William Anthony, 59, from Chingford, North London, said he suffered a string of debilitating illnesses including heart problems and arthritis which left him virtually immobile.

But his lies were revealed when a TV crew uncovering Britain’s biggest benefits cheats filled a house with furniture and called his firm to have it cleared.

Uncovered: William Anthony, who claimed to be virtually immobile, was caught out when hidden cameras filmed him operating a busy furniture-clearing business in London

Hidden cameras filmed Anthony helping move three tonnes of items, including huge book cases and shelves, from the property in Croydon, South London, in just six hours.

At the same time Anthony was being investigated by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council in London who had uncovered his double life.

He had come to the local authority’s attention when he submitted fraudulent paperwork in a bid take over ownership of his late mother’s home in the up-market Kensington.

The council also found he used a second identity - William Stanley - which he created using a false passport and helped him run his large-scale scam.

Speed: The workmen managed to completely clear the house in just six hours

Anthony told the council he was unable to work because he had hypertension, arthritis in his hips and hands, panic attacks, high cholesterol, partial deafness and speech problems.

He also claimed he was homeless and got the council to put him up in a hotel at the taxpayers’ expense while he still owned a house.

In three years he pocketed £87,037 in income support, disability living allowance and housing benefits while he was running the London-based clearance business.

Caught: The fraudster also went by the name William Stanley and said he could not walk more than 60 metres

Cover-up: Anthony said he suffered a string of debilitating illnesses - including heart problems and angina

Jailed: Anthony was given a two-year prison sentence at Isleworth Crown Court in August after admitting six fraud offences

Anthony was jailed for two years at Isleworth Crown Court in August after admitting six fraud offences.

The full extent of his scam will be shown on BBC One’s Panorama episode ‘Britain On The Fiddle’, which will be aired on Wednesday.

Series producer Duncan Staff said: 'We borrowed a council house and filled it full of rubbish, and while our undercover reporter was inside I was sat outside.

'I watched Anthony load huge cupboards and heavy equipment onto the back of this flat bed truck for hour after hour after hour.

'He was fit as anything. He did a fantastic job and there was no sign there was anything wrong with him.

'He might be a benefit cheat, but he certainly is dedicated to his work.

'We learnt through our following of him he was shameless and willing to try anything or everything to get away with it.'
