If you think the football season is only bad for your marriage, you may need to think again.

New research shows that it is also bad for your waistline, your bank balance and your liver.

The study has revealed which fans have the worst habits during the season.

Eat that: Man United fans watched Wayne Rooney bend in a free-kick against Crystal Palace on Saturday

It showed that Arsenal fans are most likely to neglect their partner, with 63 per cent admitting they spend more time with their friends than their loved ones during the season.

Manchester United supporters are the biggest lovers of takeaway food with 52 per cent saying they eat takeaways three times a week during the football season.

The Diet Chef survey also revealed that Chelsea fans are the biggest drinkers – 48 per cent say they drink during matches and the average consumption is four pints per match.

As a result, they consume 1,200 calories from beer alone during a match.

West Ham fans have been exposed as the biggest gamblers – they have an average gambling spend of £25 per game.

They are also the heaviest smokers – 35 per cent of West Ham supporters smoke on match days.

Thirsty work: Chelsea fans would have needed a pint after watching their side lose to Everton on Saturday

The poll also revealed that Manchester City fans put on the most weight during the football season – 34 per cent believe they go up by one waist size by the end of the winter.

Being married to a Tottenham Hotspur fan is not desirable - 23 per cent of Spurs fans admit to neglecting their sex lives during the football season.

The beautiful game is also bad for family life.

Some 38 per cent of male fans miss out on family days out so they can watch the game.

Finally, 52 per cent of supporters give up trying to eat healthily during the footie season and 40 per cent ditch their exercise regime.

Izzy Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: ‘It’s been really interesting to see just how much football means to the men of Britain and what compromises they will make for their love of the beautiful game.

Worth a punt: West Ham fans enjoy a bet - but how many backed a goalless draw against Southampton?

‘The survey has shown just how easy it is to put on weight with many men not realising that this regular indulgence in snacks and alcohol can cause lasting damage.

‘During the footie season it’s easy to opt for the quickest and usually the unhealthiest options, but drinking large quantities of beer and eating takeaways can do a lot of damage to your health – four pints of beer amounts to almost half of a man’s daily calorie intake, that’s a significant amount when you think about how much will then be eaten as well.

‘It appears we could help male footie fans understand that snacking and enjoying the football doesn’t have to just revolve around bad habits, and that although you can enjoy yourself during the game, it doesn’t have to go on all season.’
