A young mother's family are standing by her boyfriend after he accidentally shot her dead while firing celebratory gunshots early on New Year's Day.

In an extraordinary act of compassion, the family of Kayley Jayde Leavitt, 23, pleaded with the court in Sacramento, California on Monday to release her boyfriend, Steve Lucas, 24, from custody.

Relatives wrote six letters in support of Lucas, who is facing involuntary manslaughter charges for killing his girlfriend on January 1, and he was released on his own recognizance.

Leavitt's family said he is devastated by the killing.

'They were totally in love with each other,' her mother, Nicki Leavitt, told the Sacramento Bee. 'Steve gave her more love in her life than most women will ever know.'

Lucas and Leavitt, parents to a three-year-old daughter, had been celebrating the new year at their apartment complex with a friend at midnight, the couple went outside to fire some celebratory shots with a handgun.

Lucas, who was a practiced target shooter, fired and fatally struck Leavitt - although how she was killed is still under investigation. Both had been drinking, according to Leavitt's mother.

She said she believes her daughter grabbed Lucas as he went to fire 'to give him a hug' and walked into his gunfire.

'That's the only way I can see this happening,' she said. 'Steven does not know what happened. He just knows it happened. He had a gun and now Kayley's dead.'

A neighbor called 911 after hearing the gunshots. 

'We never heard any screaming, never any confrontations or anything,' Chuck Parelskin, another neighbor, told KXTV. 'They're always laughing, having a good time. I never really heard anybody yelling or arguing or anything like that.'

By his side: Leavitt's family wrote letters pleading with the judge to release Lucas from custody, saying he had been devoted to his girlfriend of six years and their three-year-old daughter

Hobby: The couple, who lived together in Sacramento, both enjoyed shooting targets, relatives said

The couple had met when Leavitt, then 17, was at a friend's house and saw Lucas, then 18, drive up outside the home. 'I've got dibs on him,' she told her friend.

Lucas is a house painter and tattoo artist, while Leavitt had worked at Victoria's Secret before leaving her job last year to care for her father, who passed away from cancer in May.

The couple had a three-year-old daughter and were planning on getting married and having a second child, Leavitt's mother said. 

In their letters to the judge, the family pleaded for leniency and described the happy relationship the pair had shared and how Lucas was an amazing father to their daughter, the Bee reported.

'I am Kayley Leavitt's brother, and I feel that Steven is my family as much as she is,' wrote Matthew Keller. 'Since he came into her life, her optimism, self-security and overall happiness has increased in ways that I feared it never would. Her bright and positive energy never died down for all the years that they were together.'

He explained that the little girl would never again see her mother and 'doesn't deserve to lose her father in the time she needs him the most'. 

Scene: The couple, who had been drinking on New Year's Eve, had gone outside their apartment in Sacramento just after midnight while their daughter and a friend stayed inside the home

Killed: Another image shows where Leavitt was shot. Her family believes her boyfriend accidentally shot her while going to hug him, and investigators agree they believe it was an accident

'The same goes for Steven as well,' he wrote. 'He lost his beloved girlfriend; he doesn't deserve to lose his little muffin to the same tragedy.'  

Lucas was released from custody on his own recognizance. His bail was earlier set at $190,000.

Assistant Chief Deputy District Attorney Rod Norgaard did not oppose the decision as he noted that the family unanimously asked for Lucas' release. 

His public defender, Diane B. Howard, called the incident 'extremely tragic'.

'Steven, as with many, many others, is grieving Kayley's loss every day and counts his blessings that he has the support of his family, her family and friends,' she said.

Leavitt's mother said he never wants to drink again or look at a gun. 

Lucas faces a maximum of 14 years behind bars but could also be eligible for probation without prison time if the judge decides it.

He is next in court on Tuesday.
