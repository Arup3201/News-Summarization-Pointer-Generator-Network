Tsar: Louise Casey said it would be better for some families if parents got a job instead of having another baby

Mothers of large ‘troubled’ families should be marched to their GPs for advice on contraception, a senior Government adviser said yesterday..

Louise Casey said in many troubled families would be better if parents got a job and ‘having a baby might not be the best solution’.

It came as figures showed the troubled families programme  which she runs had turned around the lives of 14,000 of England's most difficult households.

Prime Minister David Cameron pledged £448 million to turn around the lives of the UK's 120,000 most troubled families following the 2011 riots which swept London and other English cities.

The Department for Communities and Local Government said the latest figures showed local authorities were working with 50,000 families to reduce youth crime and truancy or help get adults back on the path to work - up from 35,000 in March.

But Miss Casey, who worked for Tony Blair’s government before being hired by the coalition, said more had to be done to stop families having more and more children.

Speaking at the launch of the latest figures, she said: ‘My own personal experience is that families with lots of children across lots of different age groups are stretched.

‘Managing a 21-year-old that's still living with you that's committing crime down to having another one that's two, anybody would see that that's a challenge.

‘Having a baby might not be the best solution, and actually doing something just for themselves like getting a job, getting on a course, getting their health sorted out could be the right thing to do.

‘The best family intervention gets into the family and helps them see what's the best way for them to go forward. Sometimes adding another child isn't right.’

Questioned if that should mean officials taking women to GPs’ surgeris for contraception advice, she added: ‘Yes that's right. I've come across cases where that's what some family intervention project workers have done, definitely.’

Councils are paid up to £4,000 for ‘turning around’ troubled families.

Plan: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he wanted to get people off the 'sofa of despair'

Several measures must be met to receive the cash, including if children attend classes, adults are taken off benefits and the cost to public services is reduced.

The latest figures were revealed by all 152 upper tier local authorities in England.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘We’ll let local authorities look at the most difficult families – it’s very straightforward really.

‘It’s about getting children back into school, it’s about getting people off the sofa of despair and into work and it’s cutting down the amount of anti-social behaviour that families are committing, because often on some of the larger estates these families can be quite a nuisance.’
