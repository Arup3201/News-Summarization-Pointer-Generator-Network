This is the moment a man attempted an 'incredibly stupid' 20ft tombstone into shallow water while sitting in a kayak.

Police and the RNLI have today reacted with dismay at the images of the person tombstoning 20ft off a groyne at Brighton Beach as horrified holidaymakers watch on.

Cheered on by friends, he perched in the kayak and launched himself 20ft into the shallow water below.

Police and rescue services labelled this stunt at Brighton beach as 'extremely dangerous' and 'stupid'

A Sussex Police spokesman said it was an 'incredibly stupid thing to do - he could have been killed or ended up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life'.

The spokesman added: 'Usually it is kids jumping into the sea - this is a dangerous new development if people are going to launch themselves in kayaks.'

Since 2005 there have been 20 deaths and 76 serious injuries caused by tombstoning in the UK, according to coastguard figures.

A spokesman for the RNLI warned it was 'extremely dangerous' to jump into shallow water.

'You can strike your head on the seabed or hit rocks which are not always visible.'

The craze involves jumping from cliffs, piers and other structures, before entering the water below in an upright position 'like a tombstone'.

Emergency services have continually warned of the dangers of the craze but there continues to be fatalities every year.

Last week a young man was caught on 
camera attempting a 60ft leap from Royal Albert Bridge, which spans the 
River Tamar between Plymouth and Saltash, Cornwall.

The police warning about the dangers involved in tombstoning comes just as holiday swimming spots such as the extremely popular Brighton Beach (pictured) begin to fill up in the middle of Britain's hot summer

Last week 
police along the coast in Dorset warned there could be a tragedy just 
yards from where Doctor Who star David Tennant and a TV crew are 
shooting a new series of the nail-biter TV show Broadchurch.

Daredevil
 youngsters have been tombstoning and making macho leaps up to 30ft into
 the sea from the pier at West Bay, narrowly missing boats coming in and
 out of Bridport Harbour.

Tennant,
 along with BAFTA winner Olivia Colman and the rest of the cast, are in 
the Dorset holiday resort where shooting has started on a follow-up to 
last year’s crime drama.

With the school summer break about to start, thousands of holidaying families will flock to West Bay hoping to spot a celebrity.

Nic
 Lonsdale, duty watch manager for Portland Coastguard, which covers the 
West Bay area, warned 'jumping from piers, cliffs, rocks or other 
structures into the sea can be very dangerous'.

'What
 was a deep pool at lunchtime might be a shallow puddle by teatime due 
to tidal conditions and you do not know what other hazards might be 
under the surface,' he said.

'Tomb-stoning
 can be dangerous for a number of reasons - water depth alters with the 
tide and it may be shallower than it seems, submerged objects like rocks
 may not be visible, the shock of cold water may make it difficult to 
swim and strong currents can rapidly sweep people away.'
