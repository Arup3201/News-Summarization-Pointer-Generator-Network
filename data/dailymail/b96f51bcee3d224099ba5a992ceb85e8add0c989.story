The founder of the Paris ice cream brand beloved of the city's international tourists, Raymond Berthillon, has died at the age of 90.

A visit to the Ile Saint Louis in the heart of Paris and a stone's throw from Notre Dame is on many a tourists' itinerary, partly for the architecture, the gift shopping, and the chance to take pictures of the cathedral, but also because it is the home of Berthillon ice cream.

Along the picturesque island's narrow 17th century streets, queues stretch all day and well into the night at the family-run company's handful of outlets, surrounded by the Seine river.

Some 1,000 litres of homemade ice cream, made from all natural ingredients, is produced daily

The son of a baker, Berthillon took over his mother-in-law's cafe hotel La Bourgogne on the island at the age of 30. La Bourgogne remains the centrepiece of the Berthillon ice cream empire to this day.

The ice cream shop first gained fame in 1961 when French restaurant guide Gault Millau wrote about 'this astonishing ice cream shop hidden in a bistro on the Ile Saint-Louis'.

Berthillon's death on Saturday was announced in Monday's Le Figaro newspaper.

The business, which celebrated its 60th birthday this year, posted a photograph of its founder in black and white at the top of its website on Monday, titled simply 'Raymond Berthillon 1923-2014'.

TripAdvisor has ranked Glacier Berhillion fourth out of 383 shopping attractions in Paris,  with many reviewers saying it has the 'best ice cream I've ever tasted'

The company is owned and operated by the Chauvin family, descendants of the eponymous Monsieur Berthillon
