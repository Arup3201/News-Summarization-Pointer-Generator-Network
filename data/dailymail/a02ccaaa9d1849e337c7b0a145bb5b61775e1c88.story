Singer Dappy was not at the Court of Appeal in London to hear 
three judges headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge reject his 
case

N-Dubz rapper Dappy, who was found guilty of assault and affray, lost a challenge against his conviction today.

The
25-year-old singer was not at the Court of Appeal in London to hear 
three judges headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge reject his 
case.

At Guildford Crown 
Court in February, the pop star, whose real name is Costadinos 
Contostavlos, was given a six-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, 
in connection with a brawl at a petrol station.

He was also ordered to 
carry out 150 hours of community service.

His co-defendants, Kieran Vassell - 
the brother of Dappyâ€™s partner Kaye Vassell - and songwriter Alfred 
Miller both lost appeals against their sentences.

Vassell,
25, of Hammersmith, west London, who denied affray and said he only 
acted to protect Dappy, was found guilty and jailed for 14 months.

Miller, 28, of Brentford, west London, pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to 19 months.

Mr Justice Royce said neither sentence was manifestly excessive in what was a serious affray.

The
trial heard that the brawl started after Dappy spat at a man who 
stepped in to protect two women, Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, with whom the singer had started 
arguing.

At the appeal, his
lawyers argued that the trial judge should not have admitted evidence 
of a 2008 assault conviction which involved spitting, and was wrong not 
to discharge the jury after a newspaper published an article accompanied
by a photo of the singer spitting.

They alleged this created a real risk of serious prejudice.

Mr
Justice Royce said that the judge was fully entitled to admit the 2008 
conviction and to conclude that it would not be right to discharge the 
jury.

Witnesses: It was alleged that Dappy spat at Grace Cochran, left, and Serena Burton, right, after they rejected his advances

'The photo in this case does not show him spitting at anyone. It shows him simply spitting.'

He
added that the judge weighed up matters with care and indicated he 
would remind the jury that they must decide the case on the evidence 
they heard in court, which he did.

In his judgment, the jury was not deflected from a proper and fair analysis of the evidence.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
