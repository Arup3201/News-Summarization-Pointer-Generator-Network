A husband has said he shot his wife dead when she threatened him with a knife because he wouldn't take his shoes off.

Patricia Cothran, 59, was still breathing when police arrived at the home in Moore Lane, Culleoka, Tennessee, but later died on Thanksgiving Day.

The woman's husband, James Cothran, 70, told officers he had been watching TV alone in the living room when his wife asked him to remove his shoes.

According to the police report, the shoes had belonged to her father who died 30 years ago. 

When her husband refused to remove the shoes, Mrs Cothran grabbed a knife and began walking towards him 'with a crazy look in her eyes'.

He claims that, in self-defense, he grabbed a .22 Magnum revolver which was lying on the floor next to his chair before he fired it at her. 

Mr Cothran was questioned by police but later released because of his self-defense claim.

No charges have been filed. 

Officers discovered both the knife and the gun according to the report. 

Officers said they had been called to the couple's home at least a dozen times over the past year due to domestic incidents but no arrests were made or injuries reported. 

An investigation will now be carried out and information passed over to Maury County District Attorney's office.
