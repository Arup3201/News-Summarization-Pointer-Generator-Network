Peter Richard Beaver is accused of killing Annie Beaver (pictured) at their home address on Saturday

An 80-year-old pensioner has been charged with the murder of his 81-year-old wife, police have confirmed today.

Peter Richard Beaver of Leigh Park, Havant, Hampshire, is accused of killing Annie Beaver at their home address on Saturday.

He is due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow.

Police were called to the address shortly after 6am and found the body of Mrs Beaver, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

A second 55-year-old man, who was also arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released from police custody with no further action.

This man is now assisting detectives as a witness, a Hampshire police spokesman said.

A post-mortem examination took place yesterday to determine the cause of Mrs Beaver's death, but police said today they were not in a position to confirm it due to 'ongoing inquiries'.

It is believed Mrs Beaver had been suffering from ill health, and neighbours said she had been diagnosed diabetes and alzheimer's.

A police van, police car and an officer yesterday remained outside the premises.

Police are not in a position to confirm a cause of death due to ongoing enquiries.

Anyone
with information can contact the Hampshire Major Investigation Team 
(HMIT) at Fratton Police Station in Portsmouth by phoning 101 and 
quoting Operation Opaline.Â 

Officers were called just after 6am on Saturday to the property in an area of Leigh Park, Hampshire, where the body of Mrs Beaver was found in suspicious circumstances
