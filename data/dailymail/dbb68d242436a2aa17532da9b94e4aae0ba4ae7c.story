To new overseas signings, John Clark is simply the Celtic kit man. The 73-year-old club servant who recycles the training gear and lays down their jerseys.

It takes time for the penny to drop. To realise that the grey-haired, diminutive old Bhoy servicing their needs is a living, breathing Parkhead icon. A survivor of the club’s greatest-ever triumph and their longest-serving employee since Willie Maley.

Those who doubt it are pointed to a picture of the day 47 years ago this month when Celtic became champions of Europe.

‘I don’t go about telling them who I am,’ says the modest Clark, Billy McNeill’ s former partner in central defence.

‘But I think the players spread the word.

‘They will come up and ask if it’s true. If they are down in my room I just show them the photograph.

‘I’ll say to them: “There’s been big changes since then, but take a look at that. The thing in the middle with the big handles is the thing you’ll always want to win. I won it.’”

The Lisbon Lions are old and grey now. Some, such as Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Murdoch, keeper Ronnie Simpson and striker Joe McBride are no longer with us. But their former team-mates will raise a glass to absent friends when the Lions return to Lisbon for what could be the final time this weekend.

They became champions of Europe with 11 players drawn from within a 30-mile radius of Glasgow. It’s a fact repeated many times, yet still seems mildly incredible in an era of multi-cultural football teams.

‘These days the language can be a difficulty at times,' Clark admits. ‘You can walk into a dressing room and there will be two or three foreign lads all talking a different language.

‘You don’t know what they are talking about. You just don’t like to think they are talking about you.

‘But there has always been a good camaraderie at Celtic. They have always mixed in quite quickly.’

Even so, the Lions had something special. Their stories are legend. There is always the danger of tales from the 2-1 win over Inter Milan being told so often they become stale. Such is the plight of the Scottish game now, however, that they actually become more remarkable with the passing of time.

To mark the first Champions League final held in Lisbon since that Thursday afternoon in 1967, they will come together to relive them in the Portuguese capital this weekend. What makes the trip so poignant is the possibility it might well be their final visit as a group to the city where they made their name.

‘Everyone is getting on a wee bit,’ Clark concedes, ‘but we all still get on.’

Amongst Celtic supporters, they enjoy the status of Gods. Yet they remain accessible, approachable and humble. They earned more than the average working man in 1967, but not by much. The idea of Clark doing a Yaya Toure and throwing a strop over a birthday cake is mildly ludicrous.

‘The modern-day players don’t bother too much about what we did,’ says Clark.

‘They don’t think about anyone else much. They count their cash.

‘We just looked at the wage slip and that was it. It’s different now, but players are still players.’

Together with Jim Craig and Bobby Lennox, Clark retains the sharpest memory for detail amongst the Lions.

‘I can remember all the players we came up against.

‘Laszlo Kubala of Zurich. The French captain played at Nantes. Was it Henri?

‘One of the best goalkeepers I ever saw was Illija Pantelic of Vojvodina. And then we played Inter Milan and they had Mazzola and such like. All good names. You don’t get those names these days, do you?’

Mystery: Clark has described current Celtic manager Neil Lennon as both good and bad

The Messis and Iniestas of this world are hardly footballing pygmies in comparison. And, on a memorable night two years ago, Celtic notched a notable win over the giants of Barcelona. However, when asked if the Scottish champions will ever match these clubs again, Clark is dubious. The financial gulf is now an unbridgeable chasm.

‘Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern and PSG – the cash they all have is amazing. It’ll be really difficult to win a European Cup again.

‘You have it in your mind that you’d love to do it, but you never know. The way finance is in Scottish football we’re up against it. The last 16 is an achievement now.’

Clark, who was Celtic’s assistant manager under Billy McNeill in the early 80s, tends to keep his thoughts on football matters to himself these days.

Asked his views on current boss Neil Lennon, he grins: ‘Aye – he’s good and bad isn’t he?

‘He’s done quite well in his short time in management. The club wants to be in the Champions League every year and he’s done that.

‘The more experience he gets the better he will be for it – I won’t tell you the bad things. I’ll keep them to myself.

‘If he asks me my view I’ll say something in the passing. It was the same with Martin O’Neill and Gordon Strachan. Occasionally they may ask you things in the passing - but not much.’

Knowing when to keep quiet has served Clark well during 40-odd years over three spells at Celtic.

Most of all under the formidable Jock Stein, the man who will no doubt dominate the conversation yet again in Lisbon this weekend.

‘Our gaffer was the PR man,’ Clark recalls. ‘If he said you could speak to the press, you spoke to the press.

‘If he didn’t and you did it anyway, you’d have a hard time. Especially from his left foot…’

Astute: Jock Stein managed Celtic to their only European Cup win in 1967, beating Inter Milan 2-1
