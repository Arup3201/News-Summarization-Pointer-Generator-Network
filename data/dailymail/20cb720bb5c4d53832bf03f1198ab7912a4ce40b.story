Brendan Rodgers says that Liverpool are unlikely to spend in the January transfer window despite the problems with his strikeforce this season.

Liverpool have been hit hard by the departure of Luis Suarez in the summer and injuries to Daniel Sturridge which have kept the England international out since August, with winger Raheem Sterling being used in a central role in recent weeks.

But Rodgers expects Sturridge to be back in action by mid-January after he returns from his rehabilitation in Boston later this week, and still believes £16million signing Mario Balotelli can make a contribution – albeit off the bench – therefore reducing the need for new signings.

'There won't be much activity from us in January,' said the Liverpool boss. 'We've brought in players we feel we can develop in the summer. My job is to coach the players who are here.

'I don't think it's a good time to spend. Last year we didn't bring in anyone in. The owners will always back what we want to do. If there was something we felt would benefit the group in the short or long-term then we'd do it, but I don't want to stockpile players. We've got some outstanding young talents. My focus will always be on what we've got from within.

'Daniel Sturridge is coming back early in January into the country to finalise his rehabilitation and hopefully at some point in the middle of January he'll be able to come back.'

Balotelli has only scored twice since moving to Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer and has yet to find the net in the Premier League.

Asked if the former Manchester City striker is going the same way as Andy Carroll, whose Anfield career never got off the ground before he was offloaded to West Ham, Rodgers replied: 'I don't see that. The team functions in a certain way and we need a certain profile of player to make it work as it has been over the past few weeks.

'He's a player who still has contribution to make for us. He's working hard in training and wants to be the best he can be. Whether he starts a game or comes off the bench we will look for a contribution from him.'

Liverpool have had a difficult first half to the season after finishing runners-up in the Premier League in May, although seven points from three games over Christmas has lifted the mood around Anfield.

Rodgers believes 2014 has been a good year on the whole and is looking forward to the second half of the season as his team challenge for another top-four finish.

'It's been another year of progress, he added. 'Obviously since the end of last season it's not been as good as what we've wanted but over the course of 2014 we've made significant strides forward.

'If you look at the points total over the course of the year only two teams are above us, Manchester City and Chelsea.

'Despite the start to this season we've actually made good progress. I'm pleased but we've still got a lot of work to do.

'There are a lot of very good teams trying to get into the top four. Chelsea and City are up there and too far ahead for us to effect that at this stage, but there are a number of other positions to go for.

'For us we're building confidence and momentum and I'm really looking forward to the second half of the season.'
