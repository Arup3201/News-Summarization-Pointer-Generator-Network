She has a crippling condition that is weakening her heart, causing her muscles to seize up and has very recently confined her to a wheelchair.

But through her love of music - and with little help from her friends - Kaitlin Windt is determined not to let her progressively debilitating illness stop her playing in her beloved marching band.

The 14-year-old flute player, who goes to Boardman High School in Ohio, has a dreadful birth gene that was eventually diagnosed as Friedreich's Ataxia.

It's muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, heart weakness, circulation problems, diabetes and more rolled into one tragic syndrome.

Helping hands: Kaitlin is pushed around by the band director's daughter Rachael Ruggieri who has learned the entire routine to ensure everything goes smoothly during the performance

When she reached high school this year, Kaitlin and her band director Tom Ruggieri vowed not to let Friedreich's stop her from joining the band.

With the rapid and intricate movements of a high school marching band - from twisting tubas to dipping drums to majorettes - it's no place for a wheelchair to be rolling around.

But for Ruggieri, Kaitlin's spot in the 184-member band started long before he ever met her.

Several years ago, he watched a news program about a college marching band.

In it, was a wheelchair-bound student whose father learned the march routine so he could push his son on the field.

'I choked up when I saw it,' said Ruggieri. 'I put myself in that position and wondered "How would I do it?"

'I thought: I would like to make that happen some day.'

Against the odds: The 14-year-old has Friedreich's Ataxia which causes muscular dystrophy, scoliosis, heart weakness and diabetes, but is determined to continue doing the things she loves

That 'some day' came last spring.

Kaitlin has been in a school band since fifth grade and she had dreams of being in the Boardman High band.

Walking has always been a challenge with her disease, but halfway through eighth grade last year, the curvature in her spine had progressed that she needed rods inserted in her back to straighten her.

It made her walking even more unstable and a wheelchair safer.

Kaitlin's father, Howard, said: 'Mr Ruggieri already knew of Kaitlin and her interest in band. He got a surprise with the wheelchair, though.'

Kaitlin's mother, Chrissy Longley, did not want Kaitlin's feelings hurt.

'She really wanted to be part of band, but I didn't want to get her hopes up,' Chrissy said. 'The last thing I wanted to do was have her sign up and learn that she had to sit on sidelines.'

Ruggieri didn't want that either.

'We have the same expectations for all our kids,' Ruggieri said. 'Never are all kids at the same level of music or marching. We work with all of them.'

For Kaitlin to play her flute in the Boardman band, an adult would need to learn all the drills and push Kaitlin around the field at every event. Howard's and Chrissy's work schedules would not permit them.

Ruggieri needed someone to volunteer - but he got two.

Beth Bean, band booster club president and mother to band members Jeff, a senior, and Kristine, a freshman, said: 'It brought back memories of my band life at Springfield,'

This summer, she added the role of Kaitlin's away game partner.

Kaitlin's home games were handled by Ruggieri's daughter, Rachel, who came home from Kent State to help out.

It was an easy fit for Beth and Rachel as they were set to be at the critical band camp anyway to assist Ruggieri. The three of them got started together at August camp in Erie, Pa., and Mother Nature tested them from the start.

Rain-soaked fields, mud, slogging - it was a tough introduction to their new partnership.

'We started with the worst conditions, so it could only get better,' Rachel said.

Kaitlin laughs at those first days.

'I almost fell out of my chair twice,' said the 14-year-old who, with her brother Blake, 12, splits living time between her parents' Boardman homes.

Beth recalls one tipping moment.

'I turned too fast and was not used to the chair yet and I hear "Mrs Bean - I'm tipping",' Beth said with a laugh.

Both Beth and Rachel said if you think their job was tough, try being Kaitlin and playing the flute while all this was going on.

'She did the best to play flute while we bumped around,' said Rachel. 'It was just nice to see her happy and enjoying the band.'

Already solved for the Boardman band next year is who will handle Kaitlin.

Beth and Rachel are already set to go. And Kaitlin no doubt expects to be there.

Kaitlin had a normal kid life - doing ballet and playing baseball. He parents later noticed small things, but they were dismissible.

Friedreich's itself is often not diagnosed until teen years or later, said Chrissy. That all changed in the summer before fifth grade as the disease took control.

'It affects everyone differently,' said Howard.

The impact of the diagnosis came to the family in stages.

'First they told us the ataxia part -- a tightening of the muscles, and I thought, 'oh well, no biggie - therapy and stretching,' said Chrissy.

'Friedreich's is a whole different ball game.'

Of all the harsh realities of Friedreich's, one reality strikes just a bit harder - it is genetic.

Kaitlin's brother Blake has it as well.

'I was in Columbus for work,' said Chrissy when she got the news. She and Howard ended their marriage long before Friedreich's entered their lives. 'I was away from the kids, so they could not see me break down. It was so hard to grasp. I did not function for days.'

Chrissy struggled with guilt.

'It's a horrible feeling knowing it's a genetic disease. As a parent - I know that it came from me,' she said.

Although it affects 1 in 50,000 Americans, how it happens seems almost a tragic fluke.

The gene can exist and be defective in any one person and there are no problems. That's Howard and Chrissy.

When those two people who have that defective gene have children, there's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease. That's Kaitlin and Blake.

Friedreich's Ataxia is a genetic condition that around 1 in 50,000 people in the United States.

The illness affects everyone differently, but symptoms range from loss of co-ordination in the arms and legs, fatigue, muscle loss and heart disease.

It can also cause aggressive scoliosis - a curvature of the spine - and diabetes.

The defective gene can exist in any one person and there are no problems.

But when two people who have that defective gene have children, there's a 25 per cent chance their offspring will have the disease.

There is currently no cure, but some of the symptoms can be managed.

Blake's determined that he won't be in a wheelchair, said Howard. And they notice that physical effects on him are less than Katlin's. But Blake required glasses at an earlier age - the disease affected his eye muscles.

Around Kaitlin is a core of friends who've she's known since kindergarten: Courtney Segool, Shannon McMaster and Emily Mook.

They form a tight ring around her - aiding with all her needs as needed at the dorm, on the bus and more.

'Her friends are so welcoming to her. They're the most loving people,' Rachel said.

And occasionally in life, you bump into new folks like Ruggieri, Rachel and Beth, willing to figure out new things.

'I was floored at how much they've invested in her,' said Chrissy, who was watching video posts throughout the week of band camp. 'This was a huge deal for Kaitlin.'

Rachel was nervous, she admits. She asked her father what if this doesn't work.

'He said "We're just going to make it work",' she said.

'I love that he's not afraid to take risks that others would push away.'

Ruggieri said being in band is about adjustments and acceptance, and this was just the same - even though that TV segment was his only evidence of seeing it work in his 25 years.

'None of us looked at it as "It's a great thing we're doing."

'It was simply: This is what the band needs - let's do it.'
