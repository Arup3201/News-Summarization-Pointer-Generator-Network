A Pennsylvania grandmother was sent to prison Friday after admitting to killing her toddler granddaughter with an overdose of morphine.

Penny Kochel, of Heidelberg Township, was sentenced to two to 23 months in prison after copping to involuntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal with prosecutors.

The 53-year-old first found herself in trouble in May 2009 after giving one-year-old Leanna McEntee morphine to ease teething pain and originally faced a third-degree murder charge.

‘I often wish I could trade places with her and that everything would be all right,’ the still-grieving granny said in court before her sentencing, according to the Reading Eagle.

She initially claimed she gave the baby a teething tablet and rubbed tequila on her gums to numb the pain, according to reports, but toxicology tests revealed morphine in the baby’s system.

‘Leanna was my beautiful angel,’ Ms Kochel added. ‘I would never have done anything to her that I thought would hurt or kill her.’

She was looking after the baby while the parents were on a weekend vacation.

Ms Kochel’s lawyers argued she had morphine because she was caring for her ill brother who died two weeks after Ms McEntee

The judge offered her condolences and even agreed with Ms Kochel.

‘Obviously, there was no intention to hurt the child,’ added before handing down the sentence with two additional years of probation.

The sentence was agreed to beforehand by authorities and Ms Kochel’s lawyer, according to the Eagle.

The baby’s visibly upset parents were in the courtroom for the sentencing, according to the Eagle. They declined to comment.
