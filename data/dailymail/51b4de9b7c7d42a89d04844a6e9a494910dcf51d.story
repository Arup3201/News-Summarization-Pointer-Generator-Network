Workmen were left red-faced after mistakenly painting 'Bup Stop' in the road to mark out a new bus stop.

Confused bus drivers are being forced to look twice after the Bristol City Council workers misspelt the sign on the road surface in large yellow lettering.

The gaffe, which uses the stencilled letter P instead of an S, appeared last week as part of road repairs in the Old Market area of the city centre, which is expected to last four weeks.

Bristol City Council was today unavailable for comment about the error involving the bus stop markings.

But Peter Mann, the service director for transport, said: 'It is important that we carry out these improvements as soon as possible to maintain road safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.'

Bristol City Council workers painted a keep school clear sign outside of Our Lady of the Rosary Roman Catholic Primary School in Lawrence Weston four years ago.

On one side of the road they spelt 'school' without the letter 'C'.
