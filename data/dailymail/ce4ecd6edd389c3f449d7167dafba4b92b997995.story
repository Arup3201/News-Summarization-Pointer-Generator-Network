Miss Alabama has revealed she will appear in Sports Illustrated, sparking speculation she could be appearing in the coveted swimsuit edition.

Katherine Webb, who shot to fame after 
ESPN's cameras panned to her as she cheered on her quarterback boyfriend in the BCS Championship game, let the news slip on Twitter on Thursday.

'It's official...shooting with Sports Illustrated! #Blessed,' she tweeted, before hastily deleting the post.

If she does feature in the swimsuit edition, she would join an impressive list of supermodels including Elle Macpherson, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell.

And gracing the pages of the magazine is not the only new job offer she has received since Monday night, as Donald Trump, the co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has also reached out.

Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA Pageant - also sparking rumours she might appear on his show, Celebrity Apprentice.

'We are proud of her,' he wrote, adding of her Alabama star quarterback boyfriend: 'What a great couple... Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron. They are both winners.'

The high-profile projects come despite Miss Webb, 23, previously shunning interviews following her appearance in the stands on Monday night.

Webb told TMZ that
she cancelled eight interviews scheduled for Thursday because she is 
concerned her relationship with McCarron will simply be seen as a 
'celebrity status' thing.

'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.'

She insisted that McCarron had not 
asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that 
he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend.

The
website had reported that the quarterback was unhappy that media 
outlets were ignoring his spectacular win over Notre Dame on Monday, and
giving coverage to her instead.

But
other sources said the sports star just wanted to keep his private life
out of the public eye, and wants his team's accomplishments to be 
recognised instead.

Who's that girl? Miss Webb, quickly became an internet sensation after appearing on camera on Monday

Webb became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger.

'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you 
get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 
'What a beautiful woman.'

'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.'

'If
you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw
it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married
to his wife Arlene for 50 years.

With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize on Tuesday.

'We
always try to capture interesting
storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss 
Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test.
However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far
and Brent understands that.'

But the reigning Miss Alabama simply said she was 'flattered' by their remarks.Â 

'If he had said something along the 
lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, 
that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show on Wednesday morning.

'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.'

But as well as Miss Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger.

Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed'

'On
one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' 
he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what 
that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I 
think they need to give Brent a break.'

Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Miss Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening.

And ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Trump told Page Six.

'She
was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting 
thousands and thousands of calls. Katherine has to stay grounded now 
that she's become a big star.'

Webb
was in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was 
drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and 
calls, but to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise.

'I know she's good looking,' McCarron 
said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I 
guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with
me.'

Webb, who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama and graduated from Auburn, finished in the top ten in the Miss USA competition in June and lives and works as a model in Los Angeles.

McCarron and Webb met over Twitter 
when a friend connected them in November, and in December, the sportsman
went to the pageant for Miss Alabama USA 2013, where Webb ended her 
reign.

The pair have been together since and grinned for photographs together on Christmas Eve.

Alabama beat Notre Dame 42-14 on Monday to win their third college football title in four years.

McCarron threw four touchdown passes 
and finished with 264 yards through the air, while running back Eddie 
Lacy and receiver Amari Cooper had two scores each.
