Rangers are once again flirting with financial meltdown – after the board admitted that they’ll be unable to meet the demands of creditors unless a new £4million share issue succeeds.

Despite repeated official denials of any imminent threat of a second administration, the club lodged an open offer with the Stock Exchange on Thursday, inviting existing shareholders to buy new shares at 20 pence each.

And the club warned that, unless they raise at least £3million, the offer will not proceed – adding: ‘Should this occur, the Company will be unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the Company will be uncertain; The Directors will immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available.’

Aiming for promotion: Rangers have claimed six points from their opening three games

That statement comes despite the board insisting that they have over £4million in the bank – and alongside promises to invest heavily in the club’s bid to return to a position of dominance in the Scottish game.

In a sign of how deep the crisis runs, the official statement to shareholders, outlining grand plans to raise up to £30million in the next three years, revealed that the club needed this fundraising exercise to help repay the £1.5million emergency loan taken out earlier this year.

The statement read: ‘On 23 February 2014, the Company announced that it had entered into two secured short term credit facilities for an aggregate amount of up to £1.5million.

'These credit facilities are due for repayment on 1 September 2014 and the Board is in discussions with the providers in relation to their repayment, part of which will come from the proceeds of the Open Offer.

‘The Board has developed and approved a strategic plan as part of the Business Review to re-build and re-establish the Club, to return it to the top of the domestic game within three seasons, and to thereafter be competitive in UEFA competition. This will require continued investment in the playing squad over the next three years and beyond to drive on-field success.

‘In order to achieve this, the Company will need to raise capital over the next three years. It expects to raise between £20 million and £30 million. The Open Offer is an important planned part of this fund raising strategy and will provide the Club with working capital and part of the repayment to George Letham and Alexander Easdale of the £1.5million drawn down from the credit facilities provided by them to the Company.’
