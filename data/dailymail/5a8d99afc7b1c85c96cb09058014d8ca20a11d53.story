The lawyer who led the questioning at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards was yesterday appointed a High Court judge.

Robert Jay, QC, quizzed high-profile witnesses including David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Hugh Grant and the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler during nine months of public hearings.

His prominent role as lead counsel to the televised inquiry won him plaudits in legal circles, including barrister of the year at The Lawyer awards in 2012.

Mr Jay, 53, will sit as a judge in the Queen’s Bench Division at the High Court, which deals with civil actions for personal injuries, debt, breach of contract and other claims.

The division also rules on libel claims against newspapers and other media.

As counsel to the Leveson Inquiry Mr Jay’s role was to question witnesses but to remain independent and impartial, and legal sources said it would not bar him from ruling on media cases in the future.

He will not be called to sit on the phone hacking claims currently before the High Court, as they have already been assigned to other judges.

He will join the High Court next month with an annual salary of £174,481, which is likely to amount to a pay cut compared to his earnings at the Leveson Inquiry.

The inquiry cost more than £5.4million in total, of which £1.4million was used to meet the costs of the four counsel to the inquiry. As lead counsel, Mr Jay would have taken the largest share.

He was left facing questions after it emerged that one of his junior counsel, Carine Patry Hoskins, had begun an affair with another key lawyer at the inquiry, celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne.

Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, admit going on holiday together to the Greek island of Santorini in August – days after the inquiry’s public hearings ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November.

The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay about their affair and Mr Jay said he first learnt of a ‘personal relationship of any sort’ between them in March this year, and later informed the judge.

Lord Justice Leveson has dismissed criticism that the integrity of his inquiry was undermined by revelations of the affair.

He insisted there was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’ as a result of the relationship.

Before the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Jay’s best known case was against oil-trading firm Trafigura in 2007.The company agreed to pay £30million compensation to 31,000 people in Ivory Coast who claimed they had fallen ill after toxic waste was dumped.

Mr Jay has also acted for the British Government over alleged crimes in the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising, and has defended the Ministry of Defence against allegations that it failed to help soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

He was called to the Bar in 1981 and was appointed as Queen’s Counsel in 1998, when he was 39.He was appointed as a Crown Court recorder in 2000 and was approved to sit as a deputy High Court judge in 2008. He has been vetted to act on matters of national security.

The Oxford graduate is head of his legal chambers, 39 Essex Street, where Ed Miliband’s barrister wife Justine Thornton works.

He has a daughter with his wife Deborah, an author.

Two other lawyers were also appointed as Queen’s Bench Division judges, Susan Lascelles Carr QC and Judge Andrew Gilbart QC.

High Court judges are appointed on the basis of merit following an open selection exercise carried out by the Judicial Appointments Commission.

Mr Jay’s legal chambers, 39 Essex Street, congratulated him on his appointment.A statement from the chambers said: ‘Robert has had a distinguished career which has spanned three decades.

‘Instructed as lead counsel to The Leveson Inquiry into Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press in 2011, the most closely followed public inquiry of recent times, Robert’s role was pivotal to shaping the future of the British media.’
