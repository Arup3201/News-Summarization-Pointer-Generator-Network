'The victim starts to walk in and the suspect out of nowhere starts to attack him,' Sgt. Darren Burch told Azfamily.com.

The attack happened in August, but police have just released the surveillance video in a bid to help identify the attacker.

The suspect is described as a six-foot-tall white male in his 20's with a medium build and short brown hair. He is wearing a blue t-shirt with a white logo.

The police are also searching for a man who was seen leaving the scene with the suspect. He is described as a black male in his 20's.

Police are offering a $1,000 reward for information that leads to the suspectâ€™s identification and arrest.

Sgt Burch said the attacker can expect to be charged with aggravated assault because the victim sustained such severe damage to his face and numerous facial fractures.
