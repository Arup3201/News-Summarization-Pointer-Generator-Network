This is the card Rolf Harris sent to one of his alleged victims that states: 'when it comes to having sex, if at first you don't succeed, beg'.

The bizarre note, shown to the jury at Southwark Crown Court, was signed with a 'Rolfaroo' drawing and the words 'love Rolf'.

The court was also shown an eight-page note the 84-year-old entertainer sent to the girl's father, in which he begs for forgiveness for 'harming' the girl.

The jury was shown this card Rolf Harris sent to the victim. The message includes the words: 'when it comes to having sex, if at first you don't succeed, beg... If it's not wet and sloppy, it's not a real kiss'

Inside: The note shown to Southwark Crown Court featured a 'Rolfaroo' drawing and was a number of pieces of evidence that helped convict him

On the cover of the postcard sent to the alleged victim when she left home, there is a picture of a dog and an ominous message that read: ‘All I need to know about life I learn from my dog...

'If you stare at someone long enough eventually you will get what you want.

‘When it comes to having sex, if at first you don’t succeed, beg.’

It went on: ‘Be aware of when to hold your tongue and when to use it.

‘Always leave room in your schedule for a good nap.

‘A cold nose in the crotch can be effective.

‘When you do something wrong always take responsibility as soon as you are dragged out from under the bed.

‘If it’s not wet and sloppy it’s not a real kiss.’

Inside, Harris, who faces 12 charges of indecent assault on four alleged victims, wrote: 'Dear -,

Letter to her father: Harris begged for forgiveness five times in an eight-page letter to the alleged victim's father

'When I see the misery I have caused [the alleged victim] I am sickened by myself,' the letter read

'I hope this info is all true!

'I've just had a dreary bout of vertigo with the inside of my head seeming to spin ceaselessly in an outer bony shell of a head which never moved (as I fell sideways against the wall like a drunk-

'See you soon love Rolf.'

The words were accompanied by a cheery drawing of a 'Rolfaroo'.

The letter to the alleged victim's father read: 'Dear [the father],

'Please
 forgive me for not writing sooner. You said in your letter to me that 
you never wanted to see me or hear from me again, but now [the alleged 
victim] says it's all right to write to you.

'Since that trip up to Norfolk, I have been in a state of abject self loathing. How we delude ourselves.

'I
 fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed 
from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape, no physical 
forcing, brutality or beating that took place.

'When I came to Norfolk, spent that time with [alleged victim] and realised the enormity of what I had done'

'Please forgive me, love Rolf': The letter sent to the father of the girl who claims she was abused for 16 years

'When
 I came to Norfolk, [the alleged victim] told me that she had always 
been terrified of me and went along with everything that I did out of 
fear of me.

'I
 said 'Why did you never just say no?'. And [the alleged victim] said 
how could she say no to the great television star Rolf Harris.

'Until she told me that, I had no idea that she was scared of me.

'She laughs in a bitter way and says I must have known that she has always been scared of me. I honestly didn't know.

'[The
 alleged victim] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she 
was 13. She's told you that and you were justly horrified, and she keeps
 reiterating that to me, no matter what I said to the contrary.

'She
 says admiring her and telling her she looked lovely in her bathing suit
 was just the same as physically molesting her. I didn't know. Nothing 
took place in a physical way until we had moved to Highlands. I think 
about 1983 or 84 was the first time.

'I can pinpoint a date was 1986, because I remember I was in pantomime at Richmond.

Evidence: Sonia Woodley QC (centre) suggested that a picture the alleged victim claimed had been secretly taken by Rolf Harris (left) shortly after she woke up was in fact a posed photograph taken with permission

'When
 I see the misery I have caused [the alleged victim] I am sickened by 
myself. You can't go back and change things that you have done in this 
life - I wish to god I could.

'When
 I came to Norfolk, spent that time with [the alleged victim] and 
realised the enormity of what I had done to [the alleged victim], and 
how I had affected her whole life, I begged her for forgiveness and she 
said 'I forgive you'.

'Whether she really meant it or not, I don't know. I hope she did, but I fear she can never forgive me.

'I
 find it hard to like myself in any way, shape or form. And as I do 
these Animal programmes, I see the unconditional love that dogs give to 
their owners and I wish I could start to love myself again.

'If
 there is any way that I could atone for what I have done I would 
willingly do it. If there is a way I can start to help [the alleged 
victim] to heal herself, I would willingly do it.

'With
 your permission I'll phone you in a week to talk to you. If you hang 
up, I will understand, but I would like to talk to you to apologise for 
betraying your trust and for unwittingly so harming your darling [the 
alleged victim].

'I know that what I did was wrong but we are, all of us, fallible and oh how I deluded myself.

'Please forgive me, love Rolf.

'Please
 forgive me for what must have been the most insensitive thing in your 
eyes - sending the book for Christmas. Alwen knows nothing about all 
this - at the time - and rather than tell her I signed the book and 
wrote the platitudes with sinking heart.

'Forgive me.'

Today, Mr Harris attended court with his daughter Bindi, wife Alwen and niece Jenny as the victim was cross-examined on her sexual abuse claims.

The woman allegedly sexually abused by Rolf Harris as a teenager demanded £25,000 or her brother would go to the newspapers following their affair, the jury heard.

The woman, who is now in her 40s, claims to have written to the entertainer in 1994 to ask for the money because she wanted to set up a bird sanctuary with her then boyfriend.

But Southwark Crown Court heard that when Harris told her he could not afford to pay the money she was requesting, the woman responded with a warning that he should 'keep an eye on the papers'.

After two days in the witness box, the alleged victim has now finished giving evidence.

Harris is accused of using his celebrity status to 'brazenly' abuse four girls aged between seven or eight and 19 between 1968 and 1986.

The cartoonist has previous admitted having an affair with the woman giving evidence today, but insists it was consensual and denies any sexual contact while she was underage.

Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, denies a total of 12 counts of indecent assault.

The trial continues.
