Sir Cameron Mackintosh has been branded a 'disgrace' after upsetting mourners by swearing while giving a eulogy at a friend's funeral.

Funeral attendees, who were paying their respects to Frank Conway, 88, were shocked by his use of coarse language during his address to the congregation.

Mr Conway lived as an old-fashioned retainer on the 15,000-acre estate, running a travelers bunkhouse in a former Loch Nevis church that is owned by Sir Cameron.

Sir Cameron, who owns a 15,000-acre Nevis Estate in the Highlands near where the funeral took place, is said to have used swear words and inappropriate phrases, such as 'fornicating p****.'

The incident has now been reported to the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles.

Councillor for Caol and Mallaig Bill Clark said: 'I cannot believe he would use language like that in the church. It is a disgrace.

'You
would not see that in the Highland Council chambers or in Parliament.

'You don't need any set rule in place to prevent this.

'It's unwritten 
that you don't use language like this in that situation.'

Service: Sir Cameron's eulogy was given at the Our Lady of Perpetual Succour and St Cumin church, pictured, in Morar, Inverness and was met with uproar from the congregation

The 
funeral service was held by Father Joseph Calleja, who said: 'I was 
upset by it and still am. If you cannot say something good about 
somebody, you should say nothing.'

Sir Cameron, 66, was telling a story 
about Mr Conway's time running a bunkhouse in Tarbet and referring to a 
letter sent to him by two dissatisfied German tourists when he made the 
comments.

Mourners attempted to shout Sir Cameron down during the service held at Our Lady of Perpetual Succour and St Cumin in Morar.

Retired skipper Alex Donald, 72, who was at the funeral on October 4, added: 'It is the talk of the local area.

Outrage: Sir Cameron, who has a built a personal fortune of £725million as a producer of numerous West End shows, has been reported to the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles and may receive a formal rebuke

'He has done a lot of good for the community, but now his name is mud.

'He is an educated man and should have known better.'

Sir Cameron travelled from Canada for the funeral of Mr Conway who died at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.

He said: 'What I read at the service was simply from Frank's own book with his memoirs and I was using his own words and from his own material.'

'In fact, I toned down a lot of the language that Frank had used.

'The congregation were there to celebrate Frank's life and I was very pleased that his family and many others were grateful that I properly reflected Frank's personality and the life of a very special and much-loved person.'

Retired lecturer Alasdair Roberts, a friend of Mr Conway, who attended the service defended Sir Cameron's comments.

He said: 'When Frank ran the bunkhouse, he fell out with two German tourists who were staying there and they left a letter describing him in the terms some found offensive when read out.

'It was Frank's favourite letter which he showed a lot of people.'

Joseph Toal, Bishop of Argyll and the Isles, confirmed that  the incident had been reported to him.

He said: 'The tributes in church should be shown first to the priest before being read out.

'Such tributes can be well done and very appropriate, but sometimes some things expressed would be better not said in the setting of a funeral.'

Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh

Sir Cameron Mackintosh bought 
the Nevis Estate in 1994 after spending childhood holidays there.

In 2011 arsonists torched the landowner's 19-foot Orkney Fast Liner boat,
with its 40-horsepower outboard engine, worth £20,000 at remote Tarbet 
on Loch Morar.

The arson attack came only weeks after a court ruled 
in the 13-year dispute between Sir Cameron and his crofting tenant, 
Donald Cameron, then 87.

Mr Cameron, along with many crofters in the 
remote community, opposed plans for a woodland regeneration project on 
the estate.

The Scottish Land Court ruled in Sir Cameron's favour.

He 
was allowed to take 25 acres from his tenant's holding - and part of the
new development is on the disputed land.

In November 2000, Sir 
Cameron's then holiday house on the shore of Loch Nevis was reduced to 
ashes in a mystery fire when nobody was at home.

He has since built a 
£1.4million replacement mansion.
