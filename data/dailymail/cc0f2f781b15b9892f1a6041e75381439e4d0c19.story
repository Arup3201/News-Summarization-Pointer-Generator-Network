Stuart Lancaster hesitated when asked if Danny Cipriani’s first  England call-up in almost six years is a risk.

His short answer was ‘no’ but his extended message to the gifted Sale maverick — exiled from international rugby since 2008 after testing the patience of Martin Johnson once too often — was that the fly-half will be watched carefully when he arrives as part of an initial 20-man squad for a training camp on Sunday.

England’s head coach has invested too much into improving his squad’s behaviour to allow one player, albeit one as prodigiously talented as Cipriani, to threaten their new and improved culture.

Ready to grasp his opportunity: Cipriani insists he will take his chance with both hands

‘I don’t view it as a risk,’ said Lancaster. ‘It is an opportunity. Ultimately, selection will be affected by how effective Danny is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan.

‘If he’s good enough he’ll get the opportunity to go to New Zealand and if he’s not quite ready he’ll hopefully play in the Barbarians game (at Twickenham on June 1) as the beginning of his return to international rugby.

‘I’ve spoken to him in part (about team culture) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp. I’ll arrange a one-on-one with every player. Danny’s might be a little bit longer. But of course he can train his way on to the plane. All the players can.’

Cipriani’s inclusion by no means guarantees him a place on the tour. He remains behind Saracens’ Owen Farrell, Bath’s George Ford and Northampton’s Stephen Myler in the pecking order.

But it is reward for consistent excellence for Sale this season and  working with Jonny Wilkinson’s former mentor Steve Black to improve his off-field behaviour — last season’s drunken run-in with a double decker bus was the last in a litany of misdemeanours.

With Myler and Farrell likely to be involved in the Aviva Premiership final on May 31 and therefore forced to miss the opening Test in Auckland on June 7, there is every chance the most talented English player of his generation could win a long overdue eighth cap.

‘I’ve taken a lot of feedback from the coaching team at Sale and Steve Diamond and Brian Redpath are good judges of character and talent,’ added Lancaster. ‘I spoke to Danny ahead of the Six Nations and gave him some areas to work on and he’s gone away and done that. 

Recall: Cipriani has not featured on the international stage since 2008 

‘I’m persuaded to give him an opportunity. As with all players I will judge him on when they come into camp and how they behave when they’re in it.

‘You have to earn the right — and I think Johnno was the same — by playing well for your club and behaving on and off the field.

‘Perhaps at that time that  wasn’t the case but I think it is now, so we have created this opportunity.’

Lancaster will name the final squad for the three-Test tour on Monday week. There was positive news about Billy Twelvetrees’ ankle yesterday but England are sure to be shorn of several key players.

Speaking out: Tom Wood reckons it is 'ridiculous' England are taking on New Zealand without all of their stars

It is hard not to feel sympathy for the head coach, who played no part in the fixture scheduling —described by England flanker Tom Wood as ‘ridiculous’ — which leaves the winners of this  weekend’s Premiership semi-finals knowing they will have played themselves out of the tour.

‘It’s hard to disagree with Tom and the way he articulated it,’ said Lancaster. ‘He, alongside everyone else, is frustrated by the situation. We get very few opportunities to go to a country like New Zealand and play against them and you want to go with you best side.’

Whether Cipriani is part of that group remains to be seen.
