A father-of-three bitten by a false widow spider says he feared he would need his leg amputated.

Jason Butler, from Barry, South Wales, was bitten at the beginning of July while in his garden shed.

The 41-year-old had been moving boxes around when the five spiders ran out from a gap between them.

Jason Butler nearly lost his left leg after being bitten by a spider in his garden shed four weeks ago

Unafraid of creepy crawlies, he let them run past him - and as they did, he says one bit him on the ankle.

'I felt the pinch, grabbed the spider and pulled it off,' he said. 'At the time it wasn’t painful, just a gentle sting.'

But just hours later, the bite on his ankle had become red and itchy and his leg ballooned to three times its normal size.

His GP prescribed antihistamines to help the allergic reaction and then antibiotics.

Now in excruciating pain, Mr Butler's family forced him to go to A&E.

Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff took one look at his leg and decided to operate.

Surgeons carried out two operations to drain the wound before putting Mr Butler on a six-month course of antibiotics.

Mr Butler said: 'They told me that if I hadn't gone to hospital, I may have needed my foot amputated'

Doctors have told Mr Butler he faces another six months of treatment to recover fully

He said: 'The surgeon opened it out to drain fluid and the infection and then did the same two days later.'

'They told me that if I hadn’t gone to hospital I could have needed my foot amputated.'

Although medical professionals have not commented on the type of spider bite he suffered, Mr Bulter and his wife 
Sonia are convinced it was a ‘False Widow’ spider with a bulbous, shiny 
black back.

Doctors have told him he faces another six months of treatment to recover fully. Now back home, he is undergoing negative pressure vacuum wound treatment to get more of the infection out.

Mr Bulter added: 'Everybody is shocked – even the district nurses. I went up to the hospital again for treatment last Friday and a girl was in there with a badly swollen leg from a spider bite.

'I want people to be aware of the dangers.  Barry to be aware of the danger.'

The false widow spider, which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK.

Cousin of the Black Widow and about the size of a 50 pence piece, the spider came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands.  

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.
