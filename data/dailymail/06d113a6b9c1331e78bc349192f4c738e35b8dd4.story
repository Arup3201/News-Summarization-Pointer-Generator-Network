When Ruben and Sequoia Mendoza boarded a hot air balloon, the dream wedding they had planned was finally about to begin.

But moments after the couple said 'I do' in the skies above San Diego, their ceremony took an unexpected turn. 

After a sudden change in wind direction the pilot, Phil Brandt, told the party they would be making an emergency landing in the streets below - in the middle of rush hour.

Unexpected turn: Ruben and Sequoia Mendoza were in the middle of their wedding ceremony over the skies of the Sorrento Valley in San Diego when there was a sudden change in wind direction

Dramatic descent: Pilot Phil Brandt told the wedding party they would be making an emergency landing in the middle of rush hour 

Minutes later they touched down on a busy road in the Sorrento Valley, with cars swerving to avoid it. But the ballon was quickly pushed into a nearby parking lot by Good Samaritans who were near the landing site at the time. 

Despite the terrifying set of events, the wedding guests insist they felt safe the entire flight and now the pilot has been branded a hero.

Mr Brandt, who has been driving hot air balloons for 25 years, used a tree to slow the balloon down as it descended and then leaned it against a poll so it rested safely. However he insists he was just doing his job. 

The bride's father Curtis Kam told CBS 8: 'We didn't feel like we were in any danger, we were just slow in the balloon. It was fun, it was fun.

Control: As the balloon dropped the pilot kept igniting the flame in a bid to land the balloon in a safer spot

'We hit the tree harder than the landing. The tree helped us and when we landed it was pretty soft.'

The groom's relative Maria Hafferkamp also told the station: 'We had a very professional driver and he did the best he had to do to get out us out safely and we are very happy to be in one piece.

'We are lucky for people everywhere who volunteer to help right away.' 

Despite the dramatic drop, groom Mr Mendoza said: 'We had an awesome experience, that was fun.'

Touch down: The balloon eventually landed in the middle of the road after the pilot used a tree to soften the landing. Cars swerved out of the way in order to avoid the basket 

Memorable: Mr Mendoza, pictured with his new wife Sequoia, said it was an 'awesome experience'
