The parents of a 15-year-old girl who committed suicide after relentless bullying successfully sued the school district for $225,000, it has emerged.

Irish immigrant Phoebe Prince was taunted by classmates in South Hadley, Massachusetts, after she dated a boy. She killed herself in January 2010.

The large settlement was reached more than a year ago but a journalist has only just won a court order for the release of the information.

‘This is a victory for the public's right to know and for transparency in government,’ said ACLU civil rights lawyer Bill Newman in Massachusetts.

The state American Civil Liberties Union had represented Slate reporter Emily Bazelon in her bid for the disclosure of the settlement.

Phoebe’s parents filed a lawsuit against the South Hadley Public School District in July 2010 and a settlement was reached in November 2010.

Jeremy Prince and Anne O’Brien settled claims against the town and school department, saying they would release them from further claims.

Phoebe moved to the U.S. from Ireland in 2009 and briefly dated Sean Mulveyhill, a popular boy at the school aged 17 at the time.

She was almost immediately met with a bullying campaign which included slurs about her Irish heritage and insults on Facebook.

They broke up and later Sean’s ex-girlfriend Kayla Narey and her friends bullied Phoebe. Sean and Kayla were sentenced to community service.

Five students in total accepted plea deals in criminal cases connected with bullying that preceded her death. None involved prison time.

Phoebe’s death was one of several high-profile teen suicides that prompted new laws aimed at cracking down on bullying in schools.

Her case gained global attention and all school districts in Massachusetts are now required to develop bullying prevention plans.

Superior Court Judge Mary Lou-Rup ruled in favour of Slate reporter Ms Bazelon in an order dated December 23.

Judge Lou-Rup said the town had not shown what harm would be caused by disclosure and the Prince family had not registered an objection.

'There is a dead weight that now sits permanently in my chest'

Town lawyer Edward Ryan argued that the settlement was not a public document and all parties involved had agreed to keep it confidential.

'There is a dead weight that now sits permanently in my chest,' Phoebe’s mother Mrs O’Brien said in a court statement back in May.

One of her daughter's final anguished text messages read: 'I think Sean condoning this (bullying) is one of the final nails in my coffin.’
