James Tomkins is adamant the West Ham players are fully focused on their European challenge and will not be affected by the uncertainty surrounding Sam Allardyce's future.

The Hammers boss' current contract is up at the end of the season and he is still yet to pen an extension at Upton Park.

Allardyce came under fire last week as West Brom recorded an emphatic 4-0 win over West Ham to send them crashing out of the FA Cup.

And even though contract talks between Allardyce and the owners are not set to be discussed until the summer, Tomkins claims the squad will ignore all the speculation surrounding his long-term future.

'It doesn't faze us. Obviously that is out of our hands,' Tomkins said.

'We have to do what we do on the pitch. Whoever takes charge of us next year it doesn't matter whether it is the manager or not.

'We just have to concentrate on the pitch and that's all we try and do. We don't talk about it much in the dressing room at all.

'The manager has been brilliant this year. Obviously the fans have taken their frustrations out [on him].

'I know the fans quite well through all the years, they expect the most. It's a big club and rightly so, they pay their money and travel all the way.

'They are entitled to their opinions. Obviously you are not going to keep everyone happy, there is always going to be a bunch of fans who are going to show their disappointment in a different way.'

West Ham travel to Tottenham on Sunday on the back of their biggest defeat of the season to West Brom last week.

However, Tomkins believes there is nothing better than a London derby to lift the mood of the fans.

'There's not many teams you'd pick to be a better team to bounce back against than Spurs,' Tomkins added.

'It is the sort of game that will surely put a smile back on the West Ham fans' faces. I think it is the main one fans look for every year.

'It's the biggest game of the year for the fans. White Hart Lane is always a great atmosphere as well. It means a lot to everyone at the club.'
