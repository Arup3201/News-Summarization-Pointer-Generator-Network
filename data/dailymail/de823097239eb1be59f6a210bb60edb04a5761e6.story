Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery that 25,000 litre of his wine had been drained on Sunday morning

A prominent winemaker is accused of destroying more than $300,000 worth of alcohol at the winery he was previously employed at.

Trevor David Jones, 57, of Lyndoch in South Australia's Barossa Valley, allegedly snuck into the Kellermeister winery in the early hours of February 22 and opened the taps on four tanks to release 25,000 litres of wine.

Jones faced the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Tuesday after being arrested last month, charged with serious criminal trespass and property damage.

Kellermeister owner Mark Pearce said he made the 'unfortunate' discovery on the morning of the incident.

'We're pretty lucky that the wine that was affected was some of our chardonnay and back vintage wines so all of our higher value wines were unaffected and, you know, are safe and sound,' Mr Pearce told Daily Mail Australia.

'It is what it is. We can't do much about it, it's in the hands of the police now.'

Mr Pearce said his winery predominantly produced high-value shiraz-based wines. 

A spokeswoman for the Barossa Grape and Wine Association said 'it's disappointing that it's happened' but declined to comment further as it is a legal matter.

Jones, who now runs Trevor Jones Fine Wines at Lyndoch, will face the Adelaide Magistrates Court on June 9.

Kellermeister was founded by Ralph Jones in 1976, and he ran it with his wife Val until the couple retired in 2012.

Current owner Mr Pearce purchased the business following their retirement, having joined the winery in 2009 after coming from McLaren Vale's Wirra Wirra.

Since taking over Kellermeister Mr Pearce has led the winery to global success, winning the World's Best Shiraz, Australia's Best Shiraz and the Barossa's Best Shiraz at the International Wine Challenge in London in 2012 and the Barossa's best Shiraz, Grenache and Mataro in 2013.

Mr Pearce lives on the property with his wife and three children.

The 57-year-old man arrested Tuesday has been bailed to appear in the Elizabeth Magistrates Court in March
