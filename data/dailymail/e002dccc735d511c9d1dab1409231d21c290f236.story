An electronic nose can sniff out superbug Clostridium difficile in pateints' faeces. Currently tests only look for toxins which suggest C-Diff might be present

Sniffing faeces with an ‘electronic nose’ can detect bacteria causing deadly infections, according to new research.

An electronic nose was able to sniff out whether killer hospital superbug Clostridium difficile (C-diff) was present in patients’ faeces - as well as which variety they have.

This is because different strains of the bacteria release different smelling chemicals, which the nose can pick up on.

Current tests just examine the symptoms and search the faeces for toxins which suggest C-diff is present, rather than sniffing out the bug itself.

Researchers at the University of Leicester say the tool could be useful in screening patients in future.

One of the researchers, Professor Paul Monks, told the BBC that electronic noses could be attached to bedpan washers to screen patients for C-diff.

He said: ‘By smelling different strains of C. difficile we could tell which are good and which are potentially bad, which leads to the question, "Can you screen patients?"

‘We've shown it is possible to do it in the lab - the next thing we need to do is in bedpans. 

'We can [put the e-nose] on the side of bedpan washers as you start the cycle, sniff it and then say, "You may want to look at that patient".’ 

C-diff can lead to serious infections, causing stomach cramps, temperatures and diarrhoea.

It is resistant to many ordinary antibiotics and can lead to death.

In 2012, there were 1,646 deaths in the UK involving C-diff. While the number of cases has fallen rapidly, a new strain of bacteria has emerged in recent years that tends to cause more severe infections.

It is hoped that screening for C-diff could save the NHS money if patients are not hospitalised for so long with it.

Scientists were able to work out the ‘chemical fingerprint’ of compounds associated with the different strain of the bug.

Scientists are already investigating whether electronic noses could be used to detect cancer, by looking for the unique smell of the chemicals produced by a lung or breast tumour.

As well as being able to identify which strain of bacterial species is present, the researchers said that knowing which strain of bacteria was causing the illness could allow doctors to give more targeted treatment.

Dr Martha Clokie, from the university’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, said: ‘Current tests for C-diff don’t generally give strain information - this test could allow doctors to see what strain was causing the illness and allow doctors to tailor their treatment.’
