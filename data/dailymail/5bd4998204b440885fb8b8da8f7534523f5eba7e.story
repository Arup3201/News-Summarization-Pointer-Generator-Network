The opening night of Grammy-nominated DJ Avicii's U.S. tour ended in disarray with at least 36 fans rushed to hospital.

Lines of ambulances were seen parked outside the venue, as concertgoers, many in their teens or early 20s, were taken away from the TD Garden show in Boston.

Alcohol and drugs, and in particular the party drug 'Molly', are thought to have been a factor in some of the cases as youngsters passed out in the packed arena and witnesses reported struggling to breathe in the cramped conditions.

The drug Molly is a strong form of ecstasy which has been linked in recent years to a spate of overdoses.

However, its exact chemical makeup and purity is known to vary significantly, making it almost impossible to anticipate the effects of a single 'dose'.

The Swedish electronic artist was opening the U.S. leg of his current tour, performing songs from his album 'True' which was released late last year.

Some
 described on Twitter how 'crazy' it was seeing the number of unwell 
people at the gig while others were shocked.

Many reported watching groups of two or three being taken into ambulances from the event.

'So many ambulances outside of the garden,' tweeted witness Emrah.

Reporter susantran wrote: 'Man visiting friend at #MassGen says he saw 1/2 dozen kids in emergency area who needed attention. Some incoherent.'

Following reports about the large number of hospitalizations, the Swedish DJ also tweeted his thoughts on the situation.

'Just
 hearing the awful news abt (sic) tonight,' he wrote. 'It's a terrible 
thing, I rly (sic) hope everyone is ok! My thoughts go to those affected
 & their families.'

The
 artist responsible for the hit song 'Wake Me Up' had only hours earlier
 tweeted about how excited he was for the upcoming Boston gig.

Witnesses who spoke to the Boston Globe described conditions inside the venue, which has a maximum capacity of 19,500 as unpleasant and overheated.

'You couldn’t breathe if you were on the floor. It was the best and worst time ever,' 19-year-old Mike Santostefano said.

Roisin Saratonion, 18, added that she had left earlier because of conditions inside the venue.

'You
 get really hot in there and you just pass out. You couldn’t breathe. It was claustrophobic. People get dehydrated,' she said.

It is not the first time fans of Avicii, pictured collecting an award for electronic dance music artist last year, has needed medical treatment at one of his concerts - 29 fans were hospitalized at his Toronto gig

An emergency medical services worker who treated some of the fans said most were suffering from minor symptoms.

Boston
 police Superintendent-in-Chief William Gross said the organizers had 
been told the show had to end on time because of the number of hospital 
admissions. and said had seen similar abuse of drugs and alcohol before.

Medical workers told CBS Boston that at least 50 fans were treated inside the venue, and more than 35 were taken to local hospitals.

Wednesday's concert was not the first time Avicii fans had been taken to hospital. When the DJ performed in Toronto last month 29 people were reportedly treated for medical problems.

Police plan to interview those taken to hospital to determine if drugs or underage drinking had been a factor.

TD Garden director of communications Tricia McCorkle released a statement saying the company took the incident 'very seriously'.

'We implemented increased precautions such as restricted alcohol sales, additional security and provided two cooling off areas for guests, in addition to the building maintained at normal temperature.

'We continued our proactive policy to identify impaired guests, bring them to first aid for medical evaluation and transport when necessary. By following our policy, half of the affected guests were identified prior to entering the arena and were immediately treated.'
