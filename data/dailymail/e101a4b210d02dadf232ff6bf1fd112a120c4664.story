Ministers should stop promising that controversial road-building and high speed rail schemes will give economic boosts to Britain unless they can present real ‘evidence’ to back up their claims, the UK’s  top transport planners said today.

Slashing journey times on the HS2 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the UK economy on the scale ministers were pledging, they say.

And they criticised the Treasury for ‘ducking the issue’ of how improvements to the transport system should be paid for – especially the idea of controversial ‘pay-as-you-drive’ road pricing.

Slashing journey times on the HS2 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the UK economy on the scale ministers were pledging, it has been claimed

The broadside came in a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin from 32 leading professors of transport  and  the two major professional bodies which together represent more than 3,000 UK  transport planners.

The letter to the Transport secretary signed by the 32 top academics says: ’Operating within significant  fiscal constraint, the  Department for Transport is seeking  to stimulate economic recovery, tackle climate change and improve the well-being of the population.’

But it added: ’However, we are concerned that a perception of the economic imperative is leading to a series of  important decisions on all of the major transport modes being taken in the absence  of a coherent and integrated national policy framework.’

While ministers push transport investment as a  way of stimulating economic growth, the professors insist: ‘The evidence base is not  as strong as you, or we , might wish. It to be.’

On road building they note: ’Our cities are simply not equipped to  take further growth in  road traffic and the benefits of  faster journey times on the strategic network risk being  lost in the greater congestion on local  urban roads where the majority of journeys are undertaken.’’

The letter carries the support of the Transport Planning Society and  the Royal Town Planning Institute which together cover the majority of the UK’s  3,000 town planners.

Keith Buchan, chairman of the Transport Planning Society (TPS) , under whose umbrella the letter was sent  cited the  controversial HS2 high speed line from London to the Midlands and the North said ministers had promised economic benefits – from faster journey times to  greater investment in business – he said: ’The jury is still out on HS2.’.

On building more roads he added :’We do not want to see the UK slipping back into the dead end of  trying to build our way out of congestion.

‘Ministers have to do their  proper homework. The Government’s sums need to be tested more rigorously.’

And on funding such projects it notes: ’No progress has  been made in the debate on  how we should pay for  improvements to the  transport system.

‘Understandably perhaps,  your predecessors and the Treasury have ducked  the issue.’

The planners say they support controversial pay-as-you drive road pricing but accept there is little or no public support, even though revenues from road tax are set to fall considerably as cars become cleaner:’There is a need to find a new way of charging for  motoring.’

The letter echoes a similar one sent in 2002 to then Labour Transport Secretary Alistair Darling in which transport planners and academics  warned ministers of their ‘unrealistic expectations’ .
