Nasir Mahmood was already in hospital for a routine procedure on his heart when he started showing classic stoke symptoms - but was still sent home

An angry daughter has accused hospital staff of sending her father home from hospital while he was having a stroke.  

Nasir Mahmood was already at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for a routine procedure on his heart when he started showing classic stoke symptoms.

Despite the side of his face drooping and starting to slur his speech while dribbling, his daughter Iman claims nurses told her he was 'absolutely fine' and could return home.

But soon as the 48-year-old reached his house in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, she was forced to call an ambulance to take him straight back to hospital.

Just an hour after leaving, medics confirmed he was suffering a stroke at A&E and readmitted him.

Today she lambasted NHS staff for failing to spot the tell-tale signs of a life-threatening stroke.

Miss Mahmood, 26, said: 'They say the safest place to have a stroke is in hospital. So dad was in the right place at the right time, but it meant nothing.

'When we rang to check how things had gone the nurse said he was absolutely fine and to collect him at 6.30pm.

'But I spoke to dad on the phone and he was clearly slurring his words.

'When we arrived to fetch him he was sitting alone in the atrium totally confused and with his face lop-sided.

'Although he was showing the classic signs of a stroke developing, nobody realised and he was discharged into the night.'

Miss Mahmood, who used to work for the 111 NHS helpline, added: 'If a caller described these symptoms, my computer would have automatically flagged it as a possible stroke needing an ambulance.

'At a pre-assessment clinic the previous week, mum had been told she would be able to stay through his heart procedure.

'But on the day itself she was told as it was a male-only area she had to leave and call back later.'

Takeaway owner Mr Mahmood had been into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for an operation on an existing heart condition.

After returning from the operating theatre, Pakistan-born Mr Mahmood said he was already slurring and could not swallow or fasten his trousers.

He believes the symptoms were not picked up as he could not communicate with the doctors, who did not allow English-born wife Meelam to stay to interpret.

Speaking through his daughter Mr Mahmood added: 'I am very upset they neglected to pick up such a serious illness.

'I thought what was happening was caused by the medication I had just had for the operation.

'I couldn't tell them it could be a stroke as I have never been through this before. 

'And even if I had, they wouldn't have understood me.'

His family has now contacted the PALS patient advocacy service and are also lodging a formal complaint.

Miss Mahmood added: 'Luckily dad is making a good recovery but I can't believe professionals missed what was happening.'

University Hospital of North Staffordshire nursing director Amanda Wood said: 'We are aware of Mr Mahmood's case.

'Although we can't discuss his care in detail, so far as we are aware he was treated in a proper and appropriate manner.

'We will of course contact them about any concerns they may have.'

Despite his ordeal, Mr Mahmood is now expected to make a full recovery.
