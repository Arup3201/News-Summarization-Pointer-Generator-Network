A man disappeared Sunday afternoon following a 12 kilometer race and now the only signs of him are the personal effects found mysteriously on the beach later that night.

Beau Rasmussen of Oakland, California ran the San Francisco Bay area’s Bay to Breakers race the morning of May 19 and then decided to go for a swim.

The 27-year-old parted ways with friends around noon to go for a swim at Golden Gate Park’s Ocean Beach.

Disappeared: Beau Rasmussen, 27, ran a 12K Sunday then parted with friends to swim at Ocean Beach in San Francisco and only his belongings have been seen since

He hasn’t been seen since.

On Sunday night, a passerby found Rasmussen’s passport, credit card, and cell phone—along with a baseball cap and sunglasses—near the Beach Chalet Brewery and Restaurant.

That person redialled the last outgoing call, putting him in touch with one of Rasmussen’s co-workers. The next day, Monday, he didn’t show up to work and a missing persons report was filed.

His concerned colleagues also combed the beach themselves Monday. They reached out to area jails and hospitals and asked lifeguards if they’d seen anyone matching Rasmussen’s description. 

Ominous: Rasmussen's belongings, seen here, were found at San Francisco's Ocean Beach, where he told friends he was going to swim

Nothing bore fruit.

So, on Tuesday, Rasmussen’s stepmother Nicole Apelian travelled from the Portland area to the San Francisco Bay to lead a search for her stepson Tuesday.

And from what she told KTVU, she has reason to be concerned.

‘The last he was seen was Sunday at noon,’ Apelian told the Fox affiliate. ‘I texted him at 6 that night and it was really weird he didn’t get back to me. He always gets back to me right away.’

Apelian said it was typical for Rasmussen to go for a solitary swim after a race, but less in character for him to disappear thereafter.

Typical? Rasmussen's stepmother Nicole Apelian traveled from Portland to help search for her stepson Tuesday. She said going for a swim was common for the avid outdoorsman

‘That’s something he would normally do. He’s a big strong guy. He works out every day. He’s a backpacker, he’s a hiker. Its not unusual that he would go for a swim after,’ said Apelian, whose husband—Rasmussen’s father—and sons stayed back in Portland.

‘It’s been really emotional, we just want beau back,’ she said, fighting back tears.

Co-workers and friends were joined Tuesday by Apelian, who said Rasmussen’s concerned employers even shut down operation for the day.

Dangerous: Rasmussen left friends to swim here, at San Francisco's Ocean Beach, where warnings of dangerous riptides often keep even experienced swimmers out of the water

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, 'a
unique set of geographic conditions combine to form some of the 
deadliest riptides in California' at Ocean Beach, where Rasmussen said 
he was going to swim.

Rasmussen
is described as 6-foot-2 and 195 pounds. He has brown hair and brown 
eyes. He was last seen in a maroon football jersey with the name ‘Chris’
and jeans. His clothes were not found with his other belongings.

Anyone with any information is urged to contact the San Francisco Police Department.
