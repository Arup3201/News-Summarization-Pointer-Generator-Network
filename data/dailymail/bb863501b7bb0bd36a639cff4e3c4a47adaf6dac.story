Three suspected metal thieves who were caught on top of a church’s 100ft bell tower have been let off by police – after claiming they were ‘free climbers’.

The men were spotted on St Peter and St Paul’s Church, in Kilmersdon, Somerset, after dark.

Residents suspected they might be trying to strip lead from the Grade I-listed building’s roof and called the police.

A police helicopter was scrambled, which captured the men on its thermal imaging camera as they lay on the top of the bell tower. 

But the gang claimed they were simply free climbing, an extreme version of rock climbing where no ropes or other safety equipment are used.

The men were allowed to go after police searched them and the church revealed nothing had been stolen in the incident, which took place at around 10.15pm on Tuesday.

A spokesperson for the church said: 'The first we knew about it was when the police helicopter turned up. 

'Thankfully nothing was taken and it appears that no damage was done either. Apparently it was just some boys messing around, having a joke.

'The scaffolding has been up now since the start of August as they are repairing stone work on the tower.

'Thankfully this is the first time anyone has attempted to climb it and we hope it will be the last, we would hate for anyone to get hurt.'

The church, which dates back to the 15th century, has been undergoing repairs because of extensive decay and was fixed with scaffolding. It is on English Heritage’s list of buildings at risk, who said it is in ‘poor’ condition.

Last year a group of veteran bell-ringers, including their 90-year-old leader, were forced to flee the church’s tower after a 50kg bell broke loose and crashed through two floors towards them. 

The eight parishioners said it ‘scared the living daylights out of them’, but nobody was seriously injured because the bell became stuck 30ft above their heads.

The latest incident comes after a spate of metal thefts in the area.

St Nicholas Church, in nearby Radstock, had lead stripped from its roof twice in just a month during the summer, resulting in thousands of pounds of damage to the Grade II-listed building when the roof leaked. 

Avon and Somerset police reported 69 cases of metal theft from churches in the area between 2010 and 2013.

Metal theft is not a crime defined by law but is recorded under broader crimes such as burglary and other theft. 

Last year, amid growing public pressure, MPs called for the Government to act to prevent metal theft by stopping cash transactions in the scrap metal industry and by making sellers provide ID.

The Home Office revealed there were 61,349 metal thefts recorded by police between April 2012 and March 2013. That accounts for roughly two per cent of all police recorded crime in England and Wales over the period.
