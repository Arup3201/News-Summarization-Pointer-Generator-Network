Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is set to miss the Champions League final against Real Madrid after tearing his hamstring in his side's 1-1 draw with Barcelona on Saturday.

The Brazilian-born forward was forced off after just 15 minutes at the Nou Camp having pulled up following a burst into Barca's half.

He had been struggling with a hamstring problem prior to the weekend title decider but was deemed fit enough to start for Diego Simeone's side.

Tests on Monday have indicated that the 25-year-old's latest injury will likely keep him out of action for 15 days, causing him to miss Saturday's showpiece final in Lisbon against local rivals Real.

Atletico tweeted that the striker, who has been included in Spain's World Cup squad, had suffered a grade one tear. He should be fit in time to keep his place in Vicente del Bosque's plans for Brazil.

Despite the severity of his injury, Simeone has not yet given up hope of having Costa available this weekend.

He said: 'We will work for have Diego Costa available on Saturday, but itâ€™s really difficult.

'There are several days to go and we are not going to predict now, so soon before such an important match. He is an important player but he needs to be ready.'

Preparation: Atletico trained on Monday ahead of their trip to Lisbon for the final this weekend

Atletico 
are in the final stages of a historic season but the intensity of the 
campaign has taken its toll and Arda Turan is also a doubt for the final
 with a pelvic injury.

'We
 will wait to see how Arda and Costa are by the end of the week. Given 
the situation that they are not ready then we will look for 
alternatives,' Simeone said.

The Argentine said that the team are now fully concentrated on the final with Real after their league triumph.

'It
 is always better to win and improve the morale of the players and the 
people. While we have celebrated we have to now turn the page and we 
have several days to work hard knowing that we will face strong rivals,'
 Simeone said.

Unity: Simeone believes his side has a 50 per cent chance of victory despite Real's squad strength

'I
 would say that we have a 50 percent chance in the game. They have 
better individual players but we are a team. We have plenty of 
motivation and they will have plenty as well which means that it will be
 an equal match with the key in the middle of the pitch.'

Atletico
 have met Real on four occasions this season with a win and a draw in 
the league but they lost both legs of their King's Cup semi-final tie.

But
 Simeone insisted: 'The final will be different, I don't see 
similarities with the other matches. It will be a game with friction and
 anxiety. Whoever is able to put to one side the importance of the match
 will be in best conditions to win.'
