Struggling Borussia Dortmund slumped to a disappointing defeat at Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga on Saturday.

Hertha striker Julian Schieber returned to haunt Dortmund, scoring in the 40th minute to send his former side back to the relegation zone.

The defeat was Dortmund’s ninth of the season and the 2011-12 Bundesliga champions have only claimed one point from their last seven away games.

Dortmund midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan had to go off with what looked like a hamstring injury in the 35th minute, allowing Jakub Blaszczykowski on for his comeback from a knee injury. The Poland captain hadn’t played for almost a year.

But the goal came when Per Ciljan Skjelbred capitalised on a poor pass from Neven Subotic for Blaszczykowski and quickly fed Schieber, who eluded Sebastian Kehl to score.

‘I’m extremely happy that my team won today. I’m sorry for my former teammates,’ Schieber said.

Dortmund had Mitch Langerak to thank for keeping it 1-0 before the break, the goalkeeper’s right foot enough to deny Roy Beerens.

Visiting coach Juergen Klopp reacted by bringing on former Berlin striker Adrian Ramos for the defensively minded Kehl at the break.

Mats Hummels’ powerful header was kept out by Thomas Kraft as Dortmund increased the pressure late on. The Hertha goalkeeper pulled off a great save to deny Ciro Immobile, who then headed an easier chance just wide.

‘There were four or five huge chances. We didn’t use any of them,’ said Klopp, whose side next faces tough games against Wolfsburg and Bremen.
