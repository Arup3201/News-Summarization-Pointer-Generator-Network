A friendly tiger shark that is a favorite among tourists at a popular Bahamas diving spot appears to have survived a bullet to a head, with photos showing noticeable entry and exit wounds.

The shark is known in the area around Tiger Beach - a diving section in West End on Grand Bahama Island, off the coast of Florida - as 'Hook' because she was once caught by a fisherman and suffered a broken jaw, which 'slightly hangs down on the right side of her mouth'.

According to Eli Martinez, an editor at Shark Diver Magazine, Hook is the oldest shark in the area, having been seen in the surrounding waters since 2007.

However she turned up recently with what appeared to be a 'horrific' bullet wound in her head.

Shocking: New photos of a female shark known as 'Hook' show her with a bullet wound to her head. Divers in Tiger Beach on Grand Bahama Island say there are noticeable entry and exit wounds

Shark Diver Magazine posted the news to Facebook with pictures taken during a diving expedition last month.

The magazine said they had not seen Hook since December, and where shocked when they saw what happened to her.

' Someone tried to kill her,' the magazine posted to their Facebook.

'It looks like a bang stick was used, my guess is a spear fisherman?

'Or possibly she came up to a boat to steal a fish off their line and they tried to shoot her?

'The bullet went in on one side and out on the other.'

Friendly: Hook, who is currently pregnant, is one of the main attractions among divers in Tiger Beach. Tour operators use bait to lure the sharks, who are typically friendly because they have been fed

Luckily, the magazine reported that Hook appeared to be fine.

'She looks like she is going to be ok. But the scar was horrific.,' they posted.

'She is pregnant right now and will be pupping in the next few months.

'(It) made me sad to see my old friend like this.'

According to Grind TV, the tour operators that organize dives in Tiger Beach use bait to lure sharks.

Because they are fed, they are generally friendly to swim with.

Trick time: Hook is known to play around with the divers, as seen here. There is speculation that a fisherman may have shot at her from a boat
