Nabil Bentaleb regrets missing out on Tottenham Hotspur’s League Cup semi-final but insists he has a duty to represent Algeria in the Africa Cup of Nations.

The 20-year-old scored the first goal as Spurs cruised to a 4-0 victory over Newcastle on Wednesday to set up January’s last-four date with League One Sheffield United.

Bentaleb, though, will be in Equatorial Guinea with Algeria, the country of his parents’ origin.

And the France-born midfielder says he could not refuse the call to appear at his first Cup of Nations.

‘It's a really bad thing to miss the semi-final but it's my country and I made the choice to play for them and I have to assume it now,’ said the former France youth international who played for Algeria at the World Cup.

‘I have always felt a connection to Algeria. When people ask me why I chose Algeria over France, I say when I was younger and France lost, I was not crying in front of my TV, whereas when Algeria lost I was crying and I was getting angry.

‘That's the reason why I chose Algeria because my heart always wanted Algeria.’

Bentaleb could be missing for up to four weeks should Algeria progress to the final.

However, he does not fear losing momentum at Spurs.

‘I have found my position at Tottenham but you are never safe – that’s football,’ he said.

‘You can get injured. I got injured and I came back into the team and you have to fight again.

‘Maybe next week I won't be in the team and I have to fight again. This is football, you always have to fight and even the biggest players you can see them on the bench sometimes.’

Bentaleb caught the eye when former manager Tim Sherwood elevated him to the senior set-up following his appointment 12 months ago.

And the midfielder will never forget Sherwood’s faith and influence.

‘I owe him a lot,’ said Bentaleb, who has been at Spurs’ academy since 2013.

‘He was the first one to trust me and put me in the team. Most of the credit I have is for him. I will be forever grateful to him.

‘I have developed, I have grown as a player. I know I still have a lot to learn but I'm listening to all the advice I get from everywhere. I'm like a child. I want to learn.

‘I have a lot of people around me that want the best for me and I am really lucky with that.’
