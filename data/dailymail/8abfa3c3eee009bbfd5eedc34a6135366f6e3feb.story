Sunderland are hoping the arrival of Frank Lampard at Manchester City can push Jack Rodwell towards them.

Manager Gus Poyet has been keen to sign the 23-year-old Rodwell all summer but faces competition from West Brom and Southampton among others. 

Rodwell is keen to leave City and play more regularly having played just 10 games last season.
