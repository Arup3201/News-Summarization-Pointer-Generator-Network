The UK's first fully solar-powered home, which removes the need to ever receive a gas or electricity bill again, has gone on sale - but it will set you back £1.2 million.

The timber-framed home in Great Glen, Leicestershire, contains a number of 'zero-carbon features', including solar electric energy, triple glazing and rainwater storage.

It is entirely heated by underground water-filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels.

The UK's first fully solar-powered home has gone on sale - but it will set you back £1.2million. The timber-framed home in Great Glen, Leicestershire, pictured, has a number of 'zero-carbon features', including solar electric energy, triple glazing and rainwater storage

The five-bedroom house, pictured, was designed and built by Caplin Homes and comes with two acres of land. It is entirely heated by underground water-filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels

The Government has set a target for all new homes to be zero-carbon by 2016.

Zero-carbon, also known as carbon neutral, applies to materials and processes where the amount of carbon footprint that is created is offset by the energy produced.

For example, although solar panels use carbon-based energy to be built, constructed and shipped, they offset this by using solar-based energy to power household and other items.

Buried pipes heat the earth beneath the foundations during the summer and the ground retains the heat in winter, warming the house.

The five-bedroom house was designed and built by Caplin Homes and comes with two acres of land.

Director Michael Goddard said: 'The design and construction, down to the materials, were used specifically for their low footprint.'

The Government has set a target for all new homes to be zero-carbon by 2016.

'We want to prove Government targets are achievable and genuine zero-carbon homes are a viable investment for UK house builders,' said Mr Goddard.

'The solar house shows how existing technologies can be used for a large family home but we plan to offer solutions for all house sizes.'

Dr Andrew Wright, expert in building engineering physics at De Montfort University, has been working with the developer to study the rate at which the earth will lose heat over the winter.

The solar panels on the roof of the house, pictured, are called hybrids because they collect both electrical and thermal energy. Solar walls preheat incoming ventilation air, and an Earth Energy Bank (EEB) and heat pump can store heart, and retrieve it for use when temperatures drop

All the technologies are controlled by a control system, which monitors the inside and outside temperatures, how much energy is being captured by the solar panels, and the heat levels. The south-facing triple-glazed windows, pictured, are said to also enhance the house's energy management during the winter

He said: 'The earth's low conductivity means it should retain the heat rather well.

'We will have a better idea next spring, but we estimate there's going to be more heat than you'll need. We don't know how much, though.'

the house’s energy management during the winter.

Due to its low energy design, the Solar House is expected to only require heat from the EEB for about 10 weeks of the year. For £1.2million, buyers also get two garages, pictured

panels, and the heat levels in the EEB and domestic hot water tank.

Estate agent Anthony Fox said the possibility of no utility bills was a big draw for potential owners: 'The idea is your bills pretty much disappear and the house is self-sustaining and self-sufficient. That was a big aspect for most of the people who came to have a look around.

'We had a lot of interest on the open day. There were some strong considerations to buy there and then. Everyone was very keen to learn how the house worked.'
