Brendan Rodgers has admitted Manchester City will have a massive advantage when Liverpool relaunch their push for a Champions League place this weekend.

Liverpool face the reigning champions at Anfield on Sunday but the game will start at 12pm - which is just 57 hours after they return from their Europa League tie in Istanbul.

Rodgers has been forced to shuffle his pack coming out here to Turkey, as an ankle injury to Jordan Henderson and his decision to rest Philippe Coutinho means he is without 10 senior players, as Liverpool look to protect a 1-0 first leg lead.

Brendan Rodgers believes Manchester City will have a major advantage over his Liverpool side 

Liverpool will not get back from Istanbul until at least 3am on Friday and Rodgers is concerned that City - who faced Barcelona on Tuesday - will be fresher and fitter for what could prove to be a decisive game in the battle to secure a top four spot.

'That extra period of 48 hours that they (City) will have could be crucial, certainly physically,' said Rodgers. 'Especially as we don’t get back until 3am we will have very little preparation time. 

'It’ll just be about recovery. We can’ t train on the pitch at Anfield (on Friday night), we can’t make it any worse than it is, so we’re having to train the next day (at Melwood).

'Sometimes you can get back and train later that day, it doesn't help us. But look, it’s the way it’s been dealt and we’ll deal with it the best we can. The players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep performing and doing the best we can.' 

When asked if this showed how difficult the demands of the Europa League is, Rodgers replied. 

'Especially if you don’t get help, when we are on when we are, early on the Sunday. It is still a European competition. I would rather be in it than not in it.

'We are playing a lot of games this season because we had a successful couple of games, we are doing well, we are in a couple of competitions and if we want to maintain that and work well for the coming years we have to get used to a lot of games.

'It is unfortunate but we will do our best.' Rodgers hopes Henderson will be fit to face City, while Steven Gerrard could also feature as his recovery from a hamstring problem has gone smoothly.'

Coutinho - who scored a stunning goal at Southampton last weekend - will certainly play as Rodgers felt this was an appropriate juncture to take the Brazilian out, given he has has just made 19 consecutive appearances.

'I’ve had to bring out young Coutinho,' said Rodgers. 'He hasn’t travelled. He’ s an outstanding young player for us, a key player for us and he’s played a lot of game consecutively for us now. 

'This was a game that I’d earmarked to give some recovery in knowing he can stay at home, not travel and prepare and get ready for the weekend.'
