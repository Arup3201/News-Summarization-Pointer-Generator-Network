England fans travelling to the first match of next year's World Cup are going to face an army of dangerous creepy-crawlies when they arrive.

Cobras, scorpions, and tarantulas are all found in the tropical city of Manaus, while the NHS has also warned against the risk of catching rabies from stray dogs.

Roy Hodgson has also voiced concerns about how players will cope in the heat, which averages around 32C (90F) with humidity above 80 per cent.

Fans will not want to wander too far off the beaten track in case they encounter deadly coral snakes

The Amazon rainforest around Manaus is home to the Brazilian yellow scorpion, one of the planet's  deadliest varieties, with a venomous sting that can be fatal in children or elderly adults.

While tarantulas are scary, they are in fact less venomous than a bee and their bite only causes a small amount of pain

Fans will also want to stay on the beaten track, as the jungle is also home to a variety of coral snakes, which lurk in the tree canopy and on the forest floor and use their fangs to deliver a deadly, paralysing venom when threatened.

Tarantulas also live in the loose soil, digging burrows where they wait for prey. While they cannot kill a human, their bites are painful and the hairs on their bodies can cause itching and sore skin.

The tropical climate also attracts false water cobras which can grow up to 7ft long and deliver their venom with a grinding, chewing action, rather than a quick strike, which causes bruising and swelling.

Aside from the stings and bites, which local hospitals say they can see five cases of every day, there is also a range of diseases to deal with.

Mosquitoes in the jungle carry both yellow fever and dengue, viral infections which cause headaches, fever and muscle cramps.

There are around 100million cases of 
dengue every year and there is no vaccine for it, with symptoms taking 
around two weeks to clear up.

Supporters are being urged to vaccinate 
themselves against yellow fever, which can be fatal as it attacks the 
liver, causing jaundice and yellow skin - hence the name.

The Arena Amazonia stadium, due to be completed in January, will host England for their opening game against Italy

The tropical heat, with temperatures reaching 32C (90F), brings mosquitoes which carry yellow fever and dengue which can cause fever, muscle cramps and headaches

Rabies is another serious risk from stray dogs found in the city's favelas, or slum districts.

The infection is almost always fatal unless it is caught and treated very early on, before symptoms develop. It is contracted through infected animal bites, with bats and dogs posing the highest risk.

There are 55,000 deaths every year from the illness, though vaccines reduce the risk of dying.

The NHS is also warning people to be aware of the risk of catching rabies from stray dogs. The infection can be treated early on, but is almost always fatal by the time symptoms develop (file picture)

Manaus is also known for gang violence, muggings and drug trafficking and  975 homicides were reported last year.

The Foreign Office has warned fans to be on their guard against robbers and pickpockets. The advice is to dress down and avoid wearing jewellery.

Local hotel owners are also raising their prices to capitalise on the event, with a single room now reportedly costing up to £500 per night.
