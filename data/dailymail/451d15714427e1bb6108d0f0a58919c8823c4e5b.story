A 64-year-old New Jersey woman suffered serious burns after accidentally setting her hair on fire when she was lighting a cigarette.

The smoker called 911 after her hair went up in flames just before 4.30pm yesterday at her Butler apartment.

Officers arrived to find her with severe burn wounds to her face, forehead and neck.

The elderly lady, who police haven't identified, was airlifted from her home to St. Barnabas Burn Center to be treated.

She was listed in serious condition at the hospital last night.

Captain Ciro Chimento told the Tri-Boro Patch that Butler Police responded to a frantic call yesterday afternoon.

When officers arrived at the victim's 110 Main St apartment, the woman's face and neck were severely burned and she was in distress.

Mr Chimento said that while igniting a cigarette, the woman had accidentally set her hair alight.

The fire soon spread from her hair to her face, leaving the delicate skin burnt and blistered.

She also suffered burns to her forehead and neck.

The woman was conscious, but frightened and panicking, when police arrived at her home, according to Mr Chimento.

It wasn't immediately clear which degree the burn wounds were, but Mr Chimento told the patch they were 'severe.'

Butler Fire Chief Jim Neill confirmed that a helicopter had transported the patient to hospital on Saturday afternoon.

Police are still investigating the incident to determine how it occurred.

It is unclear whether there was anyone else in the apartment at the time the woman's hair caught fire.
