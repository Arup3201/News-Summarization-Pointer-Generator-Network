Jude Law asked the News Of The World to ‘back-date’ his girlfriend’s affair with Daniel Craig so it would appear she cheated on him before he betrayed her, it was claimed yesterday.

The actor’s publicist asked the newspaper to make it seem like Sienna Miller cheated first – before Law’s fling with his children’s nanny – saying: ‘That’s the thing he [Law] wants the most’.

Meanwhile Miss Miller, 32, insisted she had never sought to manipulate Press attention and complained she had been vilified over the affair. Giving evidence to the phone-hacking trial by videolink yesterday, the actress sought to play down her fling with the James Bond star, saying it was a ‘very brief encounter’.

The affair has taken centre stage at the Old Bailey this week amid claims that the News Of The World discovered the romance through hacking a voicemail in which Miss Miller told the 007 actor, ‘I love you’.

Journalist Dan Evans told the court he hacked Craig’s answerphone and played the message to the tabloid’s editor Andy Coulson, and claimed Coulson knew it came from illegal hacking.

But Coulson’s lawyers said Miss Miller’s driver had sold the story to the tabloid after catching the actress at a secret rendezvous with Craig, and had also told Law about her infidelity.

Internal emails from the News Of The World, which summarised what the driver told the paper, said: ‘When she got in the car she spent 45 minutes talking to Daniel and trying to cover their tracks.

‘Source one [the driver] was under no doubt they had been s******g. He felt duty bound to tell Jude and he has done so. It caused huge rows.’

The court heard that Law phoned Craig and confronted him over the affair. According to other internal emails, Craig confessed and Law told him: ‘How could you do this? I thought we were friends.’

The News Of The World paid Miss Miller’s driver £6,000 and a journalist then met Law’s publicist to discuss how the paper would report the affair.

The PR asked the journalist to back-date the affair so it would appear Miss Miller cheated first, and said the request came from Law himself. According to a transcript of their taped conversation, she said: ‘If you could definitely pre-date it so that she cheated first, that’s the thing he wants the most.’

The actor was then said to have given his approval to a headline saying he had broken off their relationship over the affair. 

The publicist unleashed a ‘character assassination’ against Miss Miller, depicting her as a fame-hungry flirt and ‘a bit of a stalker’, the jury heard.

She was said to have called Miss Miller ‘embarrassingly tactile’, adding: ‘She does tend to kiss men on the mouth, she wants everyone to love her, she wants all the men in the room to love her and fancy her and all the girls to be her best friend. You should definitely put in background that she’s not a nice girl, she’s not a goody-two-shoes.’

Miss Miller’s driver said the actress had always wanted to be a celebrity, and Law was ‘her stepping-stone to fame’.

Neither the driver nor the publicist were identified as they were deemed to be confidential journalistic sources, and the journalist who interviewed them cannot be named for legal reasons.

Timothy Langdale QC, for Coulson, said: ‘It’s quite clear that the newspaper was being briefed by Jude Law’s camp. I suggest it’s a further demonstration that what was relied on was information from sources, not the voicemail.’

He said Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s head of communications in Downing Street, had believed the story came from legitimate sources.

Law, 41, denied sanctioning the article, but said his publicist had met journalists to ensure his views were represented. The court has heard that the actor was caught having a fling with nanny Daisy Wright before Miss Miller’s affair with Craig in 2005.

In her evidence, Miss Miller said it had been a ‘difficult’ time and she turned to Craig, one of her closest friends, for comfort.

She said: ‘I think the thing that’s been slightly misconstrued about this voicemail message is that I said “I love you”... I always ended my phone calls with him with “I love you”, just like I did with all my friends and family.

‘Whether I was or was not in a relationship with Daniel Craig - it was never a relationship, it was a very brief encounter.

‘He was my best friend. Me saying “I love you” – whether anything romantic had happened briefly or not – that was always the way I communicated with him, whether Jude was present or not. It’s been turned into this titillating piece of information.’

Coulson, 46, denies conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct. All seven defendants in the trial, including former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
