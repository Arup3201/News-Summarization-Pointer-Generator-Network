It's no treat for a Southern California Halloween lover after police shut down his gigantic music-and-light show.

Kevin Judd has been banned from turning on the 12,000 lights to create the display at his friends' home in Riverside.

The lights were synchronized to music, such as Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' and the 'Nightmare Before Christmas'.

Raging: The light display at the house synchronizes with Billboard hits to set off an arresting sight

Last week, Judd and his friends Melanie and Mark Betty began offering a half-hour nightly show. Hundreds of people showed up with their kids to dance or hang out at a nearby park.

But on Sunday, police responded to noise and traffic complaints and shut down the display.

Judd says it's disappointing and he isn't sure whether he'll stage more shows next year. Judd says he might look into getting a permit or renting commercial space.

'It’s really disappointing,' said Judd, 42, said Monday to The Press Enterprise. 'Screaming moms and dads (during ballgames at the park) are louder than our shows.'

Chaos: The house and its 12,000 lights are a neighborhood fixture - although some aren't so happy about it

So popular: Children from the neighborhood gather to party outside the house and are disappointed it has stopped

For the kids: Kevin Judd told CBS LA that he was annoyed that his gift to the neighborhood has been cancelled 

Each of the half-hour dispays would begin at 7.30pm and would run a show each night apart from Saturdays, when Judd would do three.

The lights were cleverly synchronized to music and would draw crowds of hundreds, especially families.

However, over the past two weeks, police dispatchers have been receiving calls from neighbors upset with the noise and lights.

The complaints have been sufficient to shut down the display and some are not happy.

'It’s great for the kids,' said Raul De La Torre, who lives next door. 'But I could see that it wears on people.'

Judd has said he is not giving up and will seek a permit fro next year.

When the sun rises: In the clear light of day the house looks just like any other suburban home
