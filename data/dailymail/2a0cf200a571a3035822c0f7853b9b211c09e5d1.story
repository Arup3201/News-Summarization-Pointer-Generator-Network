Mert Tanay has been banned from driving for three years after he was caught speeding at 124mph on the M20 with his six-year-old son as passenger 

A reckless father sped along a crowded motorway at 142mph as his six-year-old son sat terrified in the passenger seat.

Mert Tanay weaved in and out of traffic in his powerful BMW 323 and even failed to realise he had sped past a police car that had been chasing another speeding vehicle on the M20 at Harrietsham, Kent.

Police chased the 26-year-old for 10 miles to catch him and when he pulled over officers said his son looked terrified and was shaking in the passenger seat.

Tanay had told police he was driving at such speed because he was 'distracted' thinking about his forthcoming wedding in six months time. 

The incident took place on September 28, Canterbury Crown Court heard.

Tanay has been banned from driving for three years.  

He was eventually stopped by police after being seen speeding on the coastbound carriageway near Harrietsham.

Alex Rooke, prosecuting, said: 'He was driving so fast as to be considered dangerous, well in excess of 100 miles per hour.

'According to the officer his speed was excessive on what was a crowded motorway.

'He showed little regard for the welfare of his passenger and other road users for a prolonged spell of driving.'

At one point Tanay was clocked at 141.6 mph as he tore along the coastbound carriageway last September.

He admitted dangerous driving and was banned for three years and ordered to carry out 50 hours unpaid work.

Tanay, of Enfield, Middlesex, was also ordered to take an extended driving test to retain his licence by Judge Nigel van der Bijl

Defending Paul Hogben said: 'Thankfully there was no accident, injuries or damage but he is a man with a full-time job and is due to be married at the end of this month.'

Police speed cameras captured Tanay speeding at 140mph as he tore past them in his powerful BMW 

Kent Police have released a video of the chase as a warning to other motorists.

Sergeant Chris Wade said: 'The speed and manner of Mert Tanay's driving in this case showed a complete disregard for the safety of other road users, not to mention that of his young passenger who looked very shaken by his experience.

'Tanay's actions on what is a busy motorway fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.

'Educating drivers in an attempt to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Kent's roads is a vitally important part of our role.'
