It has gone down in history as one of the most legendary student pranks of all time.

A group of engineering students at Cambridge University managed to get an Austin Seven car on to a roof, baffling fellow students, faculty and police, in June 1958.

Until now, exactly how the car got onto the Senate House 70 feet up in the air has been a closely guarded secret - until today.

Original prank: The group of engineering students never revaled how they got the Austin Seven on the roof of the Senate House in 1958

Exactly 55 years after the 
original prank was pulled off, a group of cadet officers managed to 
recreate the stunt at Jesus Green, Cambridge.

A team from the University's Officer Training Corps raised a similar Austin Seven off the ground using ropes and a log structure.

It took the group just ten minutes to lift the car 20 feet with a gyn - a three-legged frame with a rope and four pulleys which is used for hoisting loads vertically.

The group had originally planned to fully recreate the joke using a 70 feet platform to represent the roof of Senate House, but the idea had to be abandoned after it was deemed unsafe.

All tied up: The cadets tied up the car to a gyn, a method which has long been suspected to have been what the original pranksters used

The engineering students behind the 1958 joke never fully explained how they got the car onto the roof, but has revealed in the past that it took several distractions, such as girls lifting their skirts, to get away with the prank undiscovered.

After a week-long battle to hoist the Austin Seven back down from the roof, police, firefighters and civil defence units  were forced to give in and took the car to pieces with blowtorches.

Following this weekend's recreation, staff sergeant Carl Webber said: ‘There were a few technical problems but in the end we got the car up in ten minutes.

‘We explained how it was done and had a lot of interest from intrigued people coming over to ask what was going on.’

Cambridge Mayor Councillor Paul Saunders, said: ‘The re-enactment is a real tribute to an event that is now known as part of the mythology of Cambridge.

‘It's great that the Royal Engineers and the officer cadets came to hoist the car up as otherwise it would be impossible.

‘I would be quite horrified to see a similar stunt happen but I think we are more aware of the dangers now.

‘In the high spirits of the 50's after the war it is understandable but we can't afford to damage any of our old buildings today.’

Basil Jaques, a committee member of Cambridge Austin 7 and Vintage Car Club, said attempts were made to invite the original perpetrators of the prank.

He said: ‘We did try to get them to come along but they are now scattered across the country and are elderly.

‘It was a good little show and we had a great response.’
