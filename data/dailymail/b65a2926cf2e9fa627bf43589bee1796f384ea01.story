Presiding in a time of crisis: Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is investigating accusations of misconduct by undercover officers

Scotland Yard is facing a fresh crisis over claims its most sensitive units were ‘infiltrated’ by corrupt officers in the pay of a crime boss.

David Hunt, one of Britain’s leading organised criminals, is accused of bribing officers to help him evade justice.

Three whistleblowers have come forward to claim the  53-year-old compromised the work of teams dealing with informants, intelligence and protected witnesses.

They allege corrupt serving and former officers helped Hunt locate and intimidate a man into dropping his evidence.

And it is claimed that when senior officers were alerted they launched an internal inquiry into the whistleblowers that only served to help the gangster.

Last week Hunt was named by a High Court judge as a ruthless gangster implicated in a career of violence and fraud.

He was exposed by a Sunday Times investigation that revealed the truth behind his façade as a scrap metal and waste dealer.

Hunt brought a libel claim against the newspaper.

But Mr Justice Simon at the High Court found Hunt was involved in fraud, prostitution, money laundering and ‘extreme violence’.

He remains under investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs for tax evasion.

The allegations are the latest in a number of scandals to rock Scotland Yard.

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe 
has already directed that allegations officers tried to smear the family
 of Stephen Lawrence are probed urgently.

Sir Bernard is also dealing with the 
fall out of a public inquiry which on Friday ruled a marksman acted 
unlawfully when he shot dead a suspected armed robber in 2005.

Three detectives have written a 54-page letter to Sir Bernard outlining how they tried to take on Hunt before the 2012 Olympics.

It names four of five officers, including a senior detective, who they claim have been working for Hunt’s crime gang.

Among them is a junior detective in a sensitive role who is alleged to have taken a £35,000 bribe from Hunt in 2007.

The three whistleblowers are suing the Met for failing to act on intelligence that Hunt had taken out a contract on them.

Instead of being backed to pursue the 
criminal, the group were themselves placed in the spotlight of a 
three-year £2million internal investigation.

In his judgment last week, Mr Justice 
Simon labelled the inquiry ‘misdirected’ and said it ‘undoubtedly 
assisted’ Hunt in escaping prosecution.

A Met spokesman confirmed the force is ‘assessing’ the allegations of corruption.
