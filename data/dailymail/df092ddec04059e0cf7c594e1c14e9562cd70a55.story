Never mind the niceties. Forget the mixed messages and crossed signals over exactly what went on between Ally McCoist and the Rangers board over the course of another day of madness. None of that mattered come game night. None of it matters now.

Because this has to be the end. A final outing for a manager who, however difficult the circumstances, appears destined to fall short in the final push needed to get Rangers back into the top flight.

A third straight title should not have been beyond even this dysfunctional club, blessed with a huge support and run on the kind of voodoo economics that guaranteed McCoist the second biggest budget in the land.

Queen of the South's Kevin Holt rifles his free-kick into the net to break the deadlock

After one more underwhelming display and another damaging defeat, this to Queen of the South in Dumfries, the task of guiding Rangers — his Rangers — to the Championship crown is clearly beyond the artist formerly known as Super Ally.

There appears to be nothing he can do to change it. No hint of a Plan B. No suggestion he and his team are about to turn a corner and go on the kind of scorching run needed to overtake Hearts.

Back at the ground where he scored his first ever goal for the club, in 1983, McCoist looked on in private torment as goals from Kevin Holt and Gavin Reilly gave the Doonhamers their first home win over Rangers for 59 years.

Jamie Fowler’s team might have won by more, as they picked holes in disorganised and demoralised opponents who, perhaps, could be forgiven for appearing confused at times. After all, they’d probably expended a lot of emotional energy before a ball had been kicked.

This was a match day like no other, the usual drag of hours and minutes until kick-off replaced by fevered speculation. Would McCoist even get on the team bus? Aye.

More impressively, he managed to stay in seat 1A all the way to Dumfries. 

Holt's free-kick was another slap in the face for the beleaguered Ally McCoist

Emerging blinking under the spotlight of TV cameras, the Ibrox manager — for now, at least —looked more relaxed once he reached the safety of a corridor underneath the main stand, smiling and greeting those who offered words of welcome and encouragement.

Yes, we know Ally has perfected the art of grinning through the agony, be it famously cracking jokes while lying on a stretcher with a broken leg on Scotland duty or deploying gallows humour to deflect from some of the worst excesses of successive Rangers regimes of dwindling competence and credibility. But he didn’t appear like a man overly concerned by his future.

As for the latest incumbents to claim leadership roles at board level, well, both Easdale brothers were at the game. It’s not clear whether the in-house Doonhamers DJ had them or the visiting boss in mind when he blasted out The Gambler — yep, Kenny Rogers giving it laldy about knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em — during the warm-up. The man with the music also gave Money’s Too Tight to Mention an airing, so it was more than just a lucky bounce of the shuffle button.

There was a danger, of course, that all the talk surrounding McCoist’s future would overshadow a fixture that, frankly, could hardly have been more important to a team desperate to make up ground in the title race.

Queen of the South celebrate taking the lead against Rangers on Friday night

Gavin Reilly fires home to put his side 2-0 up against Rangers

Rangers could not afford to lose here, handing Hearts the chance to move 12 points clear by winning at Cowdenbeath.

Queens had only just seen a seven-match unbeaten run ended at Tynecastle and, with the visitors sounding occasionally sniffy about playing on artificial surfaces, few would have been absolutely stunned by a home win here.

Especially not in these circumstances.

To muted chants of Sack The Board from the away end, the home side started like a team with their eye on hunting down Rangers and making them hurt, Reilly coming within a stud length of connecting with a John Baird cross and Iain Russell just over-running a chance before shooting from a tight angle, Steve Simonsen equal to his effort. All this in the opening 10 minutes.

Daniel Carmichael looked in his pomp in the middle of the park for the home side, controlling the tempo of play and skipping past players at will. It was no surprise he should play a part, albeit indirectly, in the opener.

With just under 20 minutes gone, the midfielder created chaos in the ranks of the red-clad visitors by driving past Ian Black to advance down the right flank, then floating in a curling cross that was heading for Russell — until Darren McGregor, in the process of slipping, stuck out a hand to divert the ball.

Shown a yellow that could have been a red, McGregor’s relief — and that of his team-mates — did not last long. Holt strode forward to convert the free-kick from the edge of the box in some style, smashing a left-footed effort into the top corner without troubling either the wall or goalkeeper Simonsen.

Queens were looking dangerous, stretching Rangers with their pace and passing. If the visitors were a little more blunt in attack, they did create a couple of chances, Jon Daly forcing Ian McShane to clear a header off the line, before Bilel Mohsni nodded over from point-blank range.

The introduction of David Templeton for Dean Shiels at half-time was intended to give Rangers more pace and trickery on the wing, although their first chance of the second half came via a more direct route, Daly holding up a long ball and playing in Nicky Law, whose curling left-footed shot was batted away by keeper Zander Clark. Kenny Miller’s sclaffed follow-up summed up his night.

Queens really should have gone two up with 56 minutes gone, Lee McCulloch heading the ball straight to Reilly, whose clever ball inside was hit first-time by Baird — when he really had time to shoot.

McCoist threw on Nicky Clark and Kris Boyd in place of Miller and Daly moments later, gambling on a change of strikers to provide something, anything, to gee his team up. Boyd created panic by his mere presence, though he snatched a chance soon after coming on.

Aside from the odd roar in response to an on-field clash, of which there were a few, the away support were extremely subdued as their team plodded and rumbled their way into defensive traps or tactical dead ends. Did anyone, but particularly McCoist, have the answer to avoiding yet another damaging defeat?

Clearly not. Queen of the South, on the other hand, had the vision and the clinical touch to put this game beyond the toiling away side. As they showed with a killer second goal after 67 minutes.

Carmichael’s beautifully executed pass from the right wing found defenders McCulloch and Mohsni too far apart, leaving space for Reilly to take the ball down in one touch and beat Simonsen with a sweetly-struck shot in off the post. End of this contest. And surely, now, the end for McCoist.
