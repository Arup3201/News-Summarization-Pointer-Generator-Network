A woman who lied to police that she had been knocked down by a van on a zebra crossing in an attempt to secure a compensation payout has avoided jail.

Kayleigh Taylor, 26, was almost clipped by the van as she was approaching the crossing in June 2011.

But she used the opportunity to hatch a plan to make money, and instantly rang police pretending the van had knocked her over.

Taylor then compounded her lies by feigning a leg injury and calling paramedics to her house after she 'managed to hobble home'.

Liar: Kayleigh Taylor instantly rang police after pretending to be hit by a van on a zebra crossing

But in reality the mother-of-one, from Guidepost, Northumberland, was completely unharmed.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how 
Taylor, quickly got in contact with her solicitor, putting in a personal
injury claim the very next day after the incident, as police tried to 
track down the mystery van driver.

Taylor's deceit only became apparent after she was exposed when CCTV was recovered from two passing buses at the scene of the make-believe accident. 

Mark Styles, prosecuting, said: 'Taylor told police a white van continued onto the crossing, she tried to get out of the way and stepped back but it struck her on her left knee and she was knocked onto the road.

Walking free: Taylor has been handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision

'She claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.'

Taylor admitted perverting justice in June last year. She was handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision on Monday, October 1.

Recorder Slater told her: 'I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion the custodial threshold has been passed.

'But having regard to your previous good character, that you were under considerable pressure at the time, and that custody would have disastrous consequences for you, your five-year-old son and your accommodation, it seems to me the most appropriate sentence is to suspend that term of imprisonment.'

It was brought to light that Taylor was out of work at the time of the incident.

Graham O’Sullivan, defending, said the lies that followed had 'got out of control'.

He said: 'The van driver did drive onto the zebra crossing when she was about halfway across but that does not justify the exaggeration she subsequently perpetrated. 

'It’s clear she was soon having second thoughts. She was not persistent in pressing the civil claim for compensation.'

Taylor 'claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.'
