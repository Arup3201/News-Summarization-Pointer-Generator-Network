A shot at market success: Tesco will stock coffee capsules from a rival to Nestle's successful Nespresso pod system. File picture

Struggling supermarket giant Tesco has signed a deal with a rival of Nestle's lucrative Nespresso coffee capsules.

CafePod will soon be sold in 650 stores throughout the UK.

The Putney, London-based brand was set up three years ago and already has its product on the shelves at Waitrose and is sold through major online retailers.

Tesco which has been losing ground to both discount stores like Aldi and upmarket rivals like Waitrose, will be keen to dip into this profitable market.

Sales of coffee capsules, or pods, in western Europe almost doubled over the past four years, to £3.3bn, according to Euromonitor. Worldwide, the market is estimated at £8.2bn.

A free-for-all was sparked after Nestle, the world's biggest food and drinks company, lost its patent covering the Nespresso coffee system after a lengthy legal battle.

Now other manufacturers can produce pods that can be used in Nestle's machines, such as CafePod.

Nespresso, known for its slick advertising featuring Hollywood actor George Clooney, is one of Nestle's fastest-growing brands and has an estimated £3.3billion in sales every year.

Peter Grainger, the South African entrepreneur behind CafePod, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Tesco recognised that we were the first coffee capsule brand to the UK multiples market.

'At the time we were the only brand listed at Waitrose, and so the leader in our field.'

The seeds for the deal were sown when the retailer approached CafePod at the 2013 London Coffee Festival.

Nespresso has fought tooth and nail to protect Nespresso. In April last year, a British court ruled that a UK manufacturer of coffee pods compatible with Nespresso machines was not infringing patents.

In October the European Patent Office revoked a Nestle patent covering a mechanism in Nespresso machines in another attempt to cut competitors out of the market.

Coffee fans get can their fix anywhere thanks to the world’s first disposable coffee machine.

The innovative product works like a teabag for coffee and promises to brew a quality cup just by adding hot water to the bag.

The water mixes with ground coffee then drips through a special filter into another chamber, from which is can be poured into cups.

Designer Ulrik Rasmussen came up with the idea from studying teabags after running out of coffee filters for his home coffee machine.

He has spent the last nine years developing the product, called Grower’s Cup, which has just launched in Britain, and said it can be used in a range of situations from at home and in the office to outdoors.

Ulrik, 46, from Middelfart in the Netherlands, said: 'It all started one morning when I went to make myself a cup of coffee and realised I had run out of filters for my machine.

'I needed my coffee fix and I was getting annoyed that it was so difficult to make a decent cup of coffee.

'As I slammed the kitchen draw shut I noticed some tea bags and I started thinking about why there wasn’t a similar product for coffee.

'I cut up a few tea bags and put coffee grounds inside them and found there was some potential for a similar product so I started doing research into it.'

Yesterday it emerged that Tesco is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets.

The nation’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily-promoted 'pound shop' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving Poundland and other low-cost chains.

The new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 Tesco stores, and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks.

Aldi’s
 sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year, while takings 
through the tills at Lidl are rising by an impressive 17 per cent.

The
 budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle Britain 
shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five
 years.

They have become known for produce, cheap dairy products and top European food and wine.

Current British market share of the major supermarkets shows Tesco is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise

Aldi
 and Lidl are targeting people with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus
 fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese.

And
 own-label tablets from Lidl and Aldi came second and third respectively
 in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog 
Which? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash.

But
 while the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco 
continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the 12 weeks to April were down by 3 per cent on a year ago.

Last month it was revealed that 
Tesco's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals 
continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low.

Britain's
 biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits 
to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year 
earlier.

Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per cent of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago.

Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30.

But
 all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with 
Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the 
past 12 months.

Waitrose 
had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also 
experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts 
for 3.4 per cent of the market.

There
 is also a perception that with stores such as Waitrose clearly 
high-end, and Lidl and Aldi clearly low-end, Tesco is losing out on 
shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground.

Meanwhile in January, Steve Smith, who founded Poundland in 1990, revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £1.

The
 minimum order value is likely to be £23, and a 'click-and-collect' 
system is being considered, which would allow customers to pick up their
 goods at other stores and shopping centres.
