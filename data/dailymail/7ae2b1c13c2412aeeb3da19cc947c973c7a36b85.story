The first Australian bodies from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 have arrived home, six weeks after Russian rebels reportedly shot down the flight by a missile, killing 295 people on board, including 38 Australians.

The operation 'Bring them Home' has brought deceased couple Maree and Albert Rizk back from Amsterdam to Sunbury in Melbourne.

A private family funeral will be held next week for the couple, who leave two children, Vanessa 22 and James 21.

At a memorial service held three weeks ago Vanessa and James spoke to a crowd of 1000 mourners as they awaited the bodies of their parents.

'We look forward now to the return of our parents and hope that all the families will soon have their loved ones returned to them,' Vanessa said. 'The reality is that our amazing parents Albert and Maree Rizk are gone. We pray to God that we will have closure sooner or later.'

'All of us will never forget ... we will love you forever,' James said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has marked the resumption of parliament in Canberra to announce that 'disaster victim identification is a very, very slow process (and) only this week the first Australian victims are coming home to their families'.

'I say to all their families you have the deepest sympathy of all of us,' he told parliament.

 Mr Abbott opened proceedings by thanking his Dutch, Ukraine and Malaysian counterparts for their assistance in the recovery and those involved in Operation Bring Them Home which 'deployed 500 Australian personnel to work with Dutch and Ukraine to recover, identify and repatriate remains of Australian victims'.

He went on to tell how they had spent six days searching the crash site and that they had recovered further remains and a substantial amount of personnel effects but 'regrettably conditions were simply too dangerous to continue'.

But the Prime Minister also pledged that there will be a return to the crash site in Ukraine.

There's been a huge outpouring of emotions across Malaysia in the past few days as the remains of victims from MH17 have begun arriving home 

'When security conditions improve and if we judge there are more remains to be recovered then recovery efforts will resume,' he added.

A permanent memorial will also be established in the grounds of Parliament in Canberra.

'I can announce today that a memorial will be erected in the parliamentary gardens to all who perished, especially the 38 Australian victims,' Mr Abbott said.

'It will be established for the first anniversary and as a reminder that we will never ever forget them.'

He also alluded to the 2 investigations which are under way, both led by the Dutch. The first being the aircraft accident investigation and the second, an international criminal investigation.

'These investigations will take some time, Australia has contributed experts to both of them,' Mr Abbott continued.

'Our nation will continue to support all who lost loved ones on flight MH17, we will do everything in our power to ensure that this horrific act is investigated and its perpetrators brought to justice.'
