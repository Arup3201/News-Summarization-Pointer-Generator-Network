Parents in a New York suburb are outraged as information comes to light about a deal struck over a decade ago by a local public school that filled their sports fields with toxic chemical waste.

A possible lawsuit is now tying the years of exposure to a string of cancer diagnoses and deaths among students who spent hours playing football, lacrosse and golf on the dangerous fields.

The fields in the Briarcliff Manor school district were closed two years ago, but only in the past few months have parents begun to piece together the possible connection between the illegal levels of toxins in the playing grounds and the blood-based cancers and tumors that lead to the deaths of two teens and treatment of more than ten others.

Known victims: Nicholas Birch died of a brain tumor last February when was 12-years-old (left), and Demetri Demeropoulos died in 2010 from a spinal cord tumor when he was 18 years old (right)

The debate dates back to 1998, when Briarcliff Manor school district struck a deal with Whitney Trucking in Yonkers that allowed the construction company to dispose of the waste from their sites in the fields so long as the company paid to have the fields constructed afterwards.

The legal claim filed by the parents of one teenager who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer states that as quickly as one year later, the New York State Department of Environment Conservation took note of the toxic fill, which was tested and found to contain at least 20 carcinogenic substances.

The State agency informed the school district of their findings but the school did nothing to alter the use of the fields nor did they tell the parents.

‘They knew 12 years ago that there was some risk of this field and they really covered it up,’ said Paul Mazzilli, the parent who filed the claim after his son Nicholas was treated for thyroid cancer.

Mr Mazzilli told MailOnline that by filing the claim, it gives his family the option to sue the school for damages, making it the first step in a possible lawsuit against the school district.

Fortunately for the Mazzili family, Nicholas’ was given a positive prognosis after his thyroid was removed and he underwent radioactive iodine treatment.

Land in question: The toxic playing fields used by Briarcliff Manor middle school and high school were finally closed in 2010 but documentation shows that the school was initially warned in 1999

The Mazzillis are not alone in their legal fight, as The Journal News reports that the families of Nicholas Birch and Demetri Demeropoulos have also filed notice of claim actions.

Nicholas Birch died of a brain tumor last February when was 12-years-old, and Demetri Demeropoulos died in 2010 from a spinal cord tumor when he was 18 years old.

The Mazzilli’s claim reads that even though the school district was warned in 1999, then faced further calls for investigations into the toxicity levels and notifications by the environmental agency in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2007, the school continued to do nothing.

The last straw came in 2010 when the neighboring little league field- which was also part of the deal with Whitney Trucking- was tested and found to be unsafe. It was only then that the Briarcliff fields were closed and middle school and high school sports practices were moved elsewhere.

A lengthy article in The Huffington Post explains that since new town board members were elected in 2010, transparency has increased regarding the schools investigation and the demands of the environmental agency.

While such transparency may be helpful in going forward, what has enraged the parents involved further is the response by former school superintendent Frances Wills.

company dumped their toxic waste in their sports fields

Ms Wills told The Huffington Post that the issue of the contaminated fields was discussed during various board meetings, but the information was not disseminated through the school community because ‘it was a different time’ before email was so commonly used to communicate with parents.

Though the Mazzillis, Demeropouloses and Birches are all considering their legal options, some have chosen to wait when it comes to any court action.

Blaise Benza, who is now-21-year-old, spent his middle school years playing baseball at Briarcliff and was diagnosed with Burkitt’s leukemia just weeks after he transferred to a private high school.

He went through extensive chemotherapy treatments that left the strapping athlete a skeleton of his former self. Though his bright spirits never dipped towards his family or friends, his eight months spent in and out of hospitals took a toll on his body.

One would not know it by looking at the 6-foot-tall young man now, Blaise weighed only 82 pounds during the worst of the cancer fight. Six years later, he continues to be cancer-free and focused more on his senior year at Villanova University than his past health battles.

His father Brett Benza told MailOnline that while they are not ruling out the possibility of legal action later, their concern now is simply one for all of the other would-be baseball stars.

‘The most important thing is that he is okay,’ Mr Benza said.

When Blaise was diagnosed, Mr Benza said that ‘we never heard anything about (the contaminated fields), no one was talking about it at the time. We hadn’t heard about any other kids.’

He said that since their family had no history of cancer, the teen’s diagnosis came as a shock, and one that he hopes no other families have to go through if the proper action is taken by the school district.

‘The first and foremost thing is concerning the community, and making sure that this doesn’t ever happen again,’ he said.
