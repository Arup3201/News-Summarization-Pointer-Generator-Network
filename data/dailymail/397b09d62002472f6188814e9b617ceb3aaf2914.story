Peter Crouch has backed Wayne Rooney to finally live up to his World Cup hype now that England are not considered a one-man team.

The England striker has flopped in his two previous trips to the sport’s biggest event, failing to score in Germany in 2006 or South Africa four years ago.

Emphasis has since been placed on the emerging talents of Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana ahead of the World Cup in Brazil and Crouch, who was part of England’s squads for both tournaments, expects Rooney to flourish in the shadows.

Main man: Wayne Rooney will be England's star at this summer's World Cup, claims Peter Crouch

‘The last two World Cups have been all about if Rooney stays fit then we are going to win it,’ the Stoke City striker said. ‘The pressure was ridiculous on him.

‘But now we have other players in the squad - I can’t even remember Rooney being mentioned too much in the lead up to this World Cup.

‘I think taking a bit of pressure of him and letting him enjoy his football can only be a good thing.’

Crouch was on the fringes of contention to appear at a third World Cup, having scored 22 goals for England in 42 appearances.

But he admitted he had no issues with being overlooked by Roy Hodgson and went on to endorse the selection of an inexperienced squad, claiming the lack of scars from previous campaigns would be beneficial.

He said: ‘I called which strikers would go (Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert) weeks ago as I felt they were the ones who are the most in-form. All four of them deserve to go.

‘My advice to any of the lads going to their first World Cup would be to go and enjoy it and take it all in if you can. It can be a blur.

‘People are watching every single game at the World Cup and you are under the microscope.

‘What is good about the squad at the minute is there are a lot of young players and it is a bit different. Hopefully they will go into the tournament with less fear and enjoy it.’

The 33-year-old added: ‘I think Sturridge can light up the tournament. He’s had an unbelievable season. Those Liverpool players, especially Sturridge and Sterling, seem to be playing with so much freedom.

‘I do think the lack of experience can help the players. I genuinely do believe that. They do not know what to expect and will go out there and continue what they have been doing this season.

‘They won’t have respect for people and just go out there and do what they know they can do. It will certainly benefit us.’
