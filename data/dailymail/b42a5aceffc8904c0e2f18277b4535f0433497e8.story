Outside court: One of Paveet Landa's relatives, Chamkh Singh (pictured), 42, has been charged with kidnapping Paveet Landa's friend Harjinder Singh

The mother of a young Sikh nursery nurse threatened to kill her daughter’s secret lover unless he revealed where she was hiding, a court heard today.

Paveet Landa, 20, ran away from her home in Ilford, east London, with her boyfriend, Ramanjit Singh, 21, to avoid an arranged marriage.

Mr Singh was found by members of her family at a temple in Southall, west London, trying to book their wedding for the next day in August 2012.

He told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court he was grabbed by three of Ms Landa’s relatives and stopped from running away, before her mother demanded he say where her daughter was.

Speaking through a translator, Mr Singh said she had told him: 'Tell us where the girl is because if her paternal uncles came they are very angry and they can kill you. Even if they have to go to prison they are not bothered because they will take revenge. You tell us now.'

He added: 'Her mother said that even if you run away to India we will not spare you.’

Mr Singh, who gave his evidence behind a screen, said Ms Landa’s older brother also made a throat-slitting gesture towards him.

He described how he was able to telephone the police, and the family eventually allowed him to leave the temple when the officers arrived.

The following day more members of Ms Landa’s extended family allegedly kidnapped her friend Harjinder Singh at knifepoint in a bid to find out where she was.

Ms Landa told police she knew her family would not accept Ramanjit Singh because he was from a different caste, was from India and could not speak English.

She told the trial: ‘I knew they 
weren’t going to accept him. As much as people say they aren’t going to 
rely on caste being a problem, I wouldn’t say that.

‘I’ve
grown up in that area and I know as their child what it’s going to be 
like. I knew that they weren’t going to accept Ramanjit. A child knows 
how their dad is and how everyone is in their family.’

Ms Landa, who later married Ramanjit Singh, said her family arranged for her to marry another man, Vikram Shari.

‘Obviously it was an introduction from my
auntie but they all arranged it,’ she told the jury. ‘They all decided 
together, my mum, my dad and my grandmother.’

'I knew they weren’t going to accept him (Ramanjit). As much as people say they aren’t going to rely on caste being a problem, I wouldn’t say that'

But the wedding was postponed after her grandfather died so she decided to elope with her boyfriend.

He told the court: ‘It was a mutual agreement with the two of us that we have no other way out. We have to run away from the house.’

Ms Landa’s father Balvinder Singh, 42, mother Rani Landa, 42 and brother Lakhanpal Landa, 21, are charged with falsely imprisoning Ramanjit Singh on August 30.

They have also been charged with kidnapping Harjinder Singh by force the following day.

Relatives Hemat Landa, 40, Chamkh Singh, 42, Kamaljit Singh, 33, and a 16-year-old who cannot be named face the same charge.

Balvinder is also accused of making a threat to kill Harjinder Singh and unlawful possession of a knife. All the defendants plead not guilty. The trial continues.
