The BBC has refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador following the Jeremy Clarkson licence plate controversy 

The BBC has refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador after Jeremy Clarkson drove through the country with a number plate which was thought to reference the Falklands War.

The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.'

Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting this month - which the corporation has now refused to give.

Clarkson, who has been widely criticised in the past for making  insensitive jokes, was pictured in a Porsche with the licence plate 'H982 FKL' - thought by some to refer to the war of 1982.

In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said the BBC would also go ahead and broadcast the programme.

He said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.'

He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank. 

'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.'

Cohen said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'.

Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman previously denied the number plate was a 'stunt' and presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming.

Ms Castro is not the first diplomat to be upset by the long-running motoring show.

In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.

May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won’t complain, it’s fine.'

In fact the Mexican ambassador, His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, did complain complain about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' and the BBC was forced to say sorry.

Yesterday Clarkson was back in hot water again after tweeting that he was driving along with a 'beer in my cup holder', prompting  drink-drive groups to brand him a 'bl**** idiot'.
