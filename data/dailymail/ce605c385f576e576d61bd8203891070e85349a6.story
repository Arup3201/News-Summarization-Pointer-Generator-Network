It could be a scene out of a 1950s horror film - an unstoppable 'ice tsunami' gradually moving ashore, destroying everything in its path.

But this footage actually shows the weather phenomenon known as ice floe in action in Minnesota, north America, over the weekend.

Strong winds are responsible for pushing this sheet of ice off the top of Lake Mille Lacs and up over the shoreline right up to resident's doorsteps. 

Creepy: Darla Johnson uploaded this footage of a sheet of ice rising out of Milles Lacs Lake towards her home in Izatys Resort, Minnesota

Winter weather: The ice flow phenomenon is caused by strong winds driving the ice ashore

And this footage filmed by a homeowner shows the eerie ice shards slowly covering ground before eventually creeping into people's home.

Youtube user Darla Johnson uploaded the footage of ice rising out of Milles Lacs Lake and into the townhomes of Izatys Resort on May 11.

The panic-stricken mother can be heard warning her son not to go near the ice while watching it getting closer and closer to her own home.

Ms Johnson says: 'Look at it. It's crawling up. It's just pushing and pushing and pushing.

Unstoppable: The ice reached front doors and windows, even entering some resident' homes

Dangerous: Winds reached up to 40 miles per hours to push the ice sheets ashore in Minnesota

'Its gone through their door. Their door's in. It's going right through their house.'

WCCO-TV reports that the ice from reached the doors and windows at the Izatys Resort on Saturday morning. But the video posted on Liveleek.com suggests it entered some homes.

National Weather Service Meteorologist Shawn Devinny says 30 to 40 mile an hour winds pushed the water into the ice, driving it ashore.

The Department of Natural Resources says about 10 miles of shoreline are covered, with some reaching up to 30 feet high.

Thick covering: Around 10 miles of shoreline were left covered with the ice sheet which was 30 feet high at points

It comes as massive ice floes rose out of a lake 600 miles north in Canada over the
weekend, destroying a dozen homes and damaging fifteen others.

Within mere moments, strong winds drove piles of ice onto
the shore from Dauphin Lake on Friday, inundating homes and giving
residents only minutes to flee.

55-mile-per hour winds drove masses of ice from the thawing lake in a phenomenon that is commonly witnessed but rarely seen with such intensity and size.

Dwarfed: Winds forced massive walls of ice onto the shores of Lake Dauphin, dwarfing homes in rural Manitoba, Canada on Friday

Unusual: A dozen homes were destroyed and many others left uninhabitable after winds piled ice onto Ochre Beach Friday in an unusually large ice flow

By Friday night, a state of emergency had been declared in
the town of Ochre River, a 188 miles northwest of Winnipeg.

Authorities told the Winnipeg Free Press that seven of the
destroyed homes were ‘literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes
from Lake Dauphin.’

Twenty-seven homes were affected in total as the frozen wall to plowed through everything in its way
along Ochre Beach.

Though the moving ice was as tall as a house in places, no
injuries have been reported.

Terrifying: Homeowners had only minutes to flee as the mounting ice entered their doors and windows

Nonetheless, residents were still shaken Saturday.

Even some of those whose houses remained standing were
allowed inside only to collect their belongings after authorities declared many
of the seemingly spared dwellings to be structurally unfit to inhabit.

One family told the Free Press the ice easily topped and pushed
into their two-story home, shuffled moved furniture around, and ‘pushed the
bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.’

‘They heard it before they saw it coming up their decks,’ Ochre
River deputy Reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday. ‘Then, it came
right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no
one was hurt. We were very lucky.’

Unlucky: The affected town Ochre River, 188 miles outside Winnipeg, had only recently begun to recover from severe floods in 2011

Help: Hundreds of volunteers showed up Saturday to help dig Ochre Beach out of the massive ice floe

The town, still reeling from a severe 2011 flood that
destroyed many homes, was somber but not helpless.

Watts was one hand for Saturday’s clean-up efforts, which saw
friends and neighbors come together to get the community back on its feet.

Hundreds of volunteers were on hand with shovels, wheel
barrows, and even bulldozers to dig the town out.

‘Everybody was pitching in to help them make it through the
day,’ Watts said. ‘It was a good community effort. It’s typical. Everybody just
helps out.’

Severe: Many of the 27 affected homes were not destroyed, but still deemed uninhabitable

Again: Some of the leveled homes were brand new, having just been rebuilt in the wake of severe 2011 flooding

Homeless: Canadian officials were at work Saturday helping the community dig out of the ice and to find shelter for those left homeless by the floe
