Phil Neville has admitted working as a commentator is harder than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance during England's World Cup opener with Italy.

Neville, a former player whose career included stints at Manchester United and Everton, was criticised for his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game.

Many viewers took to Twitter to criticise him, with several joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville.

The BBC has received hundreds of complaints about former England player Phil Neville's commentary

A BBC spokeswoman said there were 445 complaints after Saturday night’s game, which pulled in a peak audience of 15.6 million viewers.

Neville, 37, told Radio 5 Live today: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be.

'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages.

'But I’m really looking forward to the game on Thursday, I’m back in the co-commentary booth and I will get better. It was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everybody sleep back home.'

Neville, who said he 'really loved' working as a commentator, said: 'The feedback is [that] the content I put out was quite good, obviously the feedback is I need to show a little more excitement so I think you’ll see that on Thursday night.'

Julie Neville has defended her husband, Phil, after his commentary of England's World Cup match with Italy was criticised as 'dull' and 'boring' by fans on Twitter

She told her 21,000 followers that Phil is 'good at talking' and tried to deflect attention onto the pitch

Fellow broadcaster Danny Baker was among his critics, but said the BBC should share the blame

He
 said: 'Phil Neville has acknowledged he wasn't great during England 
commentary. But what were the BBC doing giving him THAT game to "learn 
his craft"?'

The BBC 
said Neville, who has received broadcasting training, was 'an important,
 well-respected member of our team' and would 'continue to play a key 
role throughout the tournament'.

His next appearance is expected to be as a studio guest for tonight's game between Iran and Nigeria.

On Raheem Sterling: 'It's so important he takes that ball and dribbles it past those Italian midfielders.'

On England: 'We want our players to be on the front foot tonight.'

On Danny Welbeck miss: 'Danny will be disappointed that he didn't hit the target there.'

Before the game: 'I always like looking at people in the warm-up, looking in their eyes.'

On Gary Lewin's injury: 'Anything can happen when everyone jumps on top of one another.'

The BBC revealed the number of complaints after Neville's wife, Julie, defended her husband on Twitter.

The mother-of-two replied to one of the few fans praising her husband, posting: 'ha ha - he is good at talking!!'

Tweeting during the game, she then tried to divert attention away from his voice and on to the football pitch, by adding: 'Nerve wracking watching this match though.'

When the fan responded by saying the 'Neville brothers are taking over' and predicting an England win, she replied: 'We have everything crossed.'

Julie, who runs her own healthy food 
website, WinNaturally.com, and has written a book of 50 Top Tips for 
Optimum Health, was praised on Twitter for putting up with her husband's
 voice.

After 
England supporters spent nearly two hours listening to his co-commentary
 on Saturday night, many suggested she deserves a medal.

Wayne French tweeted: 'Dear Julie Neville, I'm putting you forward for an MBE. You deserve so much.'

Another website user suggested she might find a health supplement to energise her husband's performance in the commentary box.

Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's dull performance in the commentary box

Broadcaster Mary Ann Sieghart branded the former Everton midfielder's voice 'talking Temazepam'

South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville

Despite also working for the BBC, comedian Danny Baker joined the backlash against the former player

Former Liverpool and Germany star Didi Hamann was among the stars criticising Neville's commentary

Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle also got in on the act, posting this joke to his 1.5million Twitter followers

The couple have been married for 14 years and have two children, a son Harvey, and daughter, Isabella.

The
 BBC has backed Neville and insisted he will remain in their commentary 
team for the tournament, co-commentating on three more live games and 
both for England's further group games for their highlights show.

The
 decision prompted comedian Alistair McGowan to comment this morning: 
'He won't be used for another full England game until the group stages 
so we've probably heard the last of him.'

Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues have been behind some the biggest controversies for the BBC.

Clarkson saw the corporation receive nearly 5,000 complaints in 2011 when he said striking workers 'should be shot' on the One Show.

The BBC was hit with more than 2,200 angry emails and phone calls earlier this year when viewers complained of 'mumbling' actors in costume drama Jamaica Inn.

Following the European elections last month, the corporation got more than 1,000 complaints about giving too much prominence to Nigel Farage and his Ukip party.

And political problems also struck last March when 600 viewers complained about presenter Eddie Mair's 'aggressive' grilling of Boris Johnson, during which the London mayor was branded 'a nasty piece of work'.

Neville, providing co-commentary 
alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the 
computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey during the game.

He was even mocked by the police, with the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string of safety advice based on his disastrous performance.

'At least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a frenzy. Drink sensibly,' read one message, while another claimed officers 'will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep the streets all calm and sleepy'.

Some fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: 'If Phil Neville reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.'

Neville seems to have taken the comments in good spirits.

He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’
