Motorists who put lives at risk by sending text messages at the wheel are to face tougher penalties.

Fines will be increased by 50 per cent to £90, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin indicated yesterday. However critics said the higher penalty has to be backed up by tougher enforcement as texting by drivers is now rife.

Announcing the crackdown, Mr McLoughlin admitted he had used a mobile phone to make calls while driving, although he would not do so now.

But he found it 'unbelievable' that motorists risk a fatal accident by texting, tweeting or using Facebook at the wheel – more distracting than being over the drink-drive limit.

Ministers plan to increase the fixed penalty for the offence of using a hand-held device while driving – whether to text or make calls – from £60 to £90, Mr McLoughlin revealed.

The number of penalty points offenders receive on their licence will remain at three. There had been calls for the 150,000 or more drivers a year convicted of offences involving mobile phones to incur a six-point penalty.

The higher fine will also apply to a range of other fixed penalty offences, including speeding and running a red light.

A new fixed penalty of a £90 fine plus
three points will be introduced for careless driving such as cutting up
other drivers, tailgating, middle-lane hogging, eating a sandwich or 
lighting a cigarette at the wheel, or driving at an inappropriate speed.

New drug-driving laws will also be brought in, although the current drink-drive limit will not be lowered.

Mr
McLoughlin said: 'We want to send a clear message to dangerous drivers:
If you continue to show complete disregard for the safety of other road
users, we will catch you – and we will punish you.'

Speaking at a road safety conference in London, Mr McLoughlin admitted: 'On occasions in the past I've used my mobile phone when driving.'

But just as drink-driving had become socially unacceptable, he would not now condone it. The idea that 'we all do it, don't we?' was no longer acceptable, he said.

Any use of a hand-held device while driving, other than to make an emergency call, has been illegal since 2003.  This applies in road jams or at traffic lights. The only time it is legal is if you are safely parked.

More than a million motorists have been convicted of using a hand-held mobile phone behind the wheel since 2003, with a peak of 161,096 convictions in 2010.

An AA/Populus poll found that 42 per cent of drivers admit using hand-held mobiles illegally and 20 per cent admit to having sent a text at the wheel.

Research carried out for Which? found that texting and tweeting at the wheel caused a 79 per cent drop in the driver's attention – up to seven times more than in someone at the legal drink-drive limit.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'With both texting and hand-held use of mobile phones at the wheel causing more impairment than being at the drink-drive limit or under the influence of cannabis, the police need to target the large number of motorists continuing to flout the law.'

In March, Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that drivers caught using a mobile phone should receive six penalty points so that a second offence would trigger a ban.
