Princes William and Harry today joined the flood relief effort by helping soldiers to lay sandbags in Datchet.

The brothers secretly joined members of Harry's Household Cavalry regiment to shore up the defences just a stone's throw from the Queen's residence, Windsor Castle.

Their trip to the front line of the crisis is reportedly the second intervention into the flooding crisis by the Royal Family, after the monarch apparently criticised the Government's response to the disaster.

Teamwork: Princes William and Harry were knee deep in flood water at one point

Joint effort: The princes joined members of the Household Cavalry who were lending their time to the relief efforts

According to sources, William and Harry had been keen to play a part for some days but did not want to publicise their presence for fear of distracting from the crisis facing householders.

They joined military personnel at 6am this morning and had hoped to stay working all day. But by mid morning, word of their presence had already slipped out.

Harry was wearing his army fatigues while William was in 'civilian' dress.

Downpour: William was later drenched when it started raining hard over the flood-affected town

A royal aide said: 'This is not something they wanted publicised and it was only decided on Wednesday night.

'They were very keen to help with the flood relief effort and thought that joining the military would be the best way.'

A Buckingham Palace spokesman told MailOnline: ‘They joined the Household Cavalry this morning from 6am and they have been helping to build walls of sandbags.’

William and Harry later left the office of Datchet Parish Council and got into a car alongside military personnel to continue the relief effort.

Appreciated: Local town leaders praised the contribution made by William and Harry

Experienced: Both princes have previously served in disaster and emergency situations

Meeting: The brothers went to speak to members of the local council at the temporary military base in the Datchet town hall

Parish clerk Graham Leaver said: 'They were very involved and wanting to know what was going on. They have been in Datchet and the area and I think it's gone down very well. That is my assessment.

'They were very natural. To be honest, they could have walked in among people here and nobody would have recognised them looking at the way they were dressed.

'They were particularly interested in talking to the troops. The support we have received from the Army has been absolutely excellent and if they hadn't come into Datchet we as a parish would have been overwhelmed.'

While the floodwaters have receded since
 their peak earlier this week, 2in of rain was set to fall today with 
more tomorrow, raising the possibility of homes and businesses facing 
fresh horror over the weekend.

A royal aide said the pair did not want their efforts publicised in advance and only decided top pitch in on Wednesday night

When Harry was asked by reporters if he was enjoying helping out, he replied: 'Not really, with you guys around'

The princes helped by unloading 
sandbags from military trucks onto freight trains which would then take 
them to areas where they are most needed.

They
 are no strangers to working in disaster zones and providing emergency 
relief - William has worked as a rescue helicopter pilot, while Harry 
has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan.

The Queen, William and Harry's 
grandmother, has also been lending a hand to flood victims by providing 
farmers with a way to look after their livestock during the crisis.

A
 Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Queen is supporting Somerset 
farmers affected by the flooding on the Somerset Levels by contributing 
feed and bedding from the royal farms at Windsor.'

Barrier: William helps another soldier construct a dam to prevent the weather from causing too much damage in the future

Intrepid: Harry joined other soldiers as they waded through waist-deep water

Defences: A wall of sandbags is erected in Datchet to ward off floodwater which could rise following today's rain

Getting stuck in: The princes and the Household Cavalry were undeterred by the onset of rain later in the day

Also wading in: Prime Minister David Cameron was also treading water today while he had a discussion with farmer Tim Hook in the West Brampton area of Oxfordshire

The public statement came as Deputy 
Prime Minister Nick Clegg denied a report that the Queen criticised the 
Government response to the floods in a private meeting with him in his 
role as president of the Privy Council.

Asked
 on LBC radio whether it was true that the Queen had 'waded in' over 
flooding, Mr Clegg replied: 'No.' He declined to discuss the content of 
their conversations any further.

But
 the fact that her efforts have been made public will be seen as a coded
 rebuke to the Government's reaction to the widespread devastation 
caused by the extreme weather.

Meanwhile,
 Lord Smith - a former Labour minister who has been heavily criticised 
for his response to the floods crisis - was far away from affected areas
 as he was seen outside his home in Islington.

The
 grandee has faced repeated calls for his resignation over accusations 
the Environment Agency exacerbated the scale of the disaster by failing 
to dredge vulnerable rivers.
