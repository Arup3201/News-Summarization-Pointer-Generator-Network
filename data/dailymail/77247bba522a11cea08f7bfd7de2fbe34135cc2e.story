To Italians, Francesco Totti is a mixture of Steven Gerrard, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. In Rome, he is considered a God – something even the Vatican has to accept.

At the age of 38, the greatest Italian player of his generation – better than Andrea Pirlo or Alessandro del Piero – will make a rare appearance in England on Tuesday night in his quest to try and win the one major trophy, the Champions League, missing from his collection.

And judging by his performances this season, the oldest swinger in town isn't ready to go home yet and tuck in with a nice cup of cocoa.

Francesco Totti has been a pivotal player for Roma since his professional debut for his boyhood club in 1992. Here is a compilation of images from each of his 23 seasons at the Serie A club. Top left is from his first season in 1992-93 to the bottom right image from the current 2014/15 campaign.

The forward will be a major threat to Manchester City's hopes of progressing past the group stages of Europe's elite competition 

Totti, like Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs, has managed to play in a top European league while in his late-30s

Italian football was littered with a number of world class players during Francesco Totti's first season in the club's senior side.

Roma's rivals AC Milan went onto win the title in 1993 with 50 points from 34 games.

Teams were awarded just two points for a win in 1993, as compared to the three points you now collect after a victory.

Lazio's Giuseppe Signori finished as the league's top scorer with 26 goals, while the likes of Gabriel Batistuta, Roberto Mancini and Marco van Basten were also plying their trade in Italy.

To call Totti the archetypal No 10 with balance, vision, quick feet and set-piece goals doesn't begin to his incredible career justice. Like Gerrard, he is a revered local hero, always staying faithful for his hometown club Roma when Europe's biggest clubs would have taken him in an instant. 

Like Giggs, he refuses to play by the normal rules of ageing and goes on and on, scoring until now a club record 235 goals in 564 games. And like Beckham, his style and private life are great sources of fascination. His wife isn't called Victoria but Ilary Blasi is a former showgirl and model, and the pair are Italy's premier celebrity couple. Their wedding was screened live on Italian television in 2005.

Current Roma manager Rudi Garcia quickly realised to succeed in Italy's partisan capital, you have to pay homage to Totti. 'For me he is one of the very best players in the history of the sport, and someone with great qualities as a man,' he pointed out shrewdly.

Totti's trophy cabinet includes Serie A, Italian Cup, Italian SuperCup and World Cup winners' medals despite competing against Juventus and the two Milan clubs.

The Champions League is the one he really wants now before retirement and he has a particular axe to grind with Manchester ahead of Tuesday night's game against City. In 2007, he was part of a Roma side humiliated 7-1 at Old Trafford when his ego was dealt a huge blow by being completely overshadowed by Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney.

To tap into the Totti psyche, you have to understand his relationship with the club.

Totti is expected to start against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night - along with former Premier League star Cole

One of the 38-year-old's biggest career lowlights came in April 2007 when Roma were thrashed 7-1 by Manchester United at Old Trafford

As a teen, he used to ride a scooter from his home in 'authentic Rome', the San Giovanni district, to watch The Giallorossi play in the Olympic Stadium.

He made his Roma debut way back in 1993 when Serie A boasted great names like Ruud Gullit, Roberto Mancini and Paul Gascoigne.

Starting line-up: Tony Coton, David Brightwell, Keith Curle, Terry Phelan, David White, Fitzroy Simpson, Niall Quinn, Mike Sheron, Stephen McMahon, Rick Holden, Andy Hill.

Subs: Peter Reid, Garry Flitcroft, Martyn Margetson. 

It was his creativity that set him apart from other players. He played for Italy in the final of Euro 2000 and the following season inspired Roma to only the third Serie A title win in their history, under the leadership of Fabio Capello.

Roma had some great players in that team - Cafu, Gabriel Batistuta and Walter Samuel among them – but Totti was the captain and undisputed No1. It was fitting he scored the opening goal in the 3-1 victory against Parma that clinched the league.

Totti was just 24 at the time and the world was at his feet. Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli would have sold Fiat to get him to Turin but the player wanted to stay at home. AC Milan and Real Madrid have also come knocking at different times.

He might not have won as many trophies but he received an adulation among his own fans never replicated before or since.

When he scored a key last-minute penalty for Italy against Australia on the way The Azurri becoming world champions, Totti said although the experience was memorable, it couldn't compare to winning The Scudetto with the team he supported as a boy. From that moment, he was as untouchable to Romans as one of their Emperors.

Totti was part of the Italian side which won the 2006 World Cup against France at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany

He and Ilary were granted the ultimate honour, a speaking part in The Simpsons, later in 2006. The following year, he appeared in the movie L'allenatore nel Pallone 2 as a defence attorney.

In recent years he has been in regular demand on television, both chatshows, reality shows and dramas. A collection of figurines entitled 'Francesco Totti, the captain' were made in his honour.

Now Il Bimbo D'Oro (The Golden Boy) is very much the senior man, playing under his 14th manager in 20 seasons in Rome.

Though Roma boast names like Miralem Pjanic, Ashley Cole and the rejuvenated Gervinho, Totti's name will be the one that will grab most attention at The Etihad on Tuesday night.

He is the Rome's ultimate Gladiator, and always good for a news story; whether it's by celebrating a goal by shoving a ball up his jumper and simlulating childbirth, or claiming that only Lionel Messi is better among modern players.

As he approaches 40, even Totti must realise he won't have many more chances to fulfil his Champions League ambition. City must be wary - this guy writes his own scripts.
