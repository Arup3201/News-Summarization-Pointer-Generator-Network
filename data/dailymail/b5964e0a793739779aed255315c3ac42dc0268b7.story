An open-top bus, like this one in London, has collided with an low-hanging cable in San Francisco injuring five tourists

A woman was hospitalised and four others were injured when the open-top bus they were 
travelling on drove into a low-hanging phone cable in San Francisco.

A 67-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with injuries to her face 
and head that were originally described as life-threatening, according 
to police.

Four other people, aged in their 40s and 60s suffered cuts and bruises to their hands and faces, the officer said.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle's website, SF Gate, a 
double-decker open-top bus operated by Big Bus Tours was involved in the
incident after it took a deviation from its standard route.

Andrew Smith, general manager of the tour group, told the news service 
the driver had taken a different journey to avoid traffic as it travelled 
north approaching the Golden Gate Bridge.

He told the news service: 'We have buses that take that route all the 
time. At least four or five buses passed through that same day before 
the wire (incident).'

The incident happened between Anza and Bilboa streets, around 3.15pm on Monday.

Police officer Tracey Turner told the local paper that the wire hit the 
bus's front windshield, popped over the top of the bus and struck some 
people sitting at the back of the open-air vehicle.

While she described the 67-year-old woman's injuries as 
life-threatening, Mr Smith told the paper the woman left the hospital 
that evening and took another bus tour with the company before flying 
home.
