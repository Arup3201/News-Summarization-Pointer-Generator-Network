Mastermind: Adam Simmons was jailed last year for his role in a scam where gem dealers conned elderly victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth

A gang of gem dealers made £1million by conning elderly victims into buying diamonds for up to thirty times their actual worth, a court heard today.

As part of the alleged boiler room fraud, the gang cold-called investors, many of them pensioners, before sending them glossy brochures for bogus company No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex.

Among the victims was a retired police officer duped into using up 
the last of his savings to buy coloured stones for £140,000 which were 
worth little more than £10,000.

Mastermind Adam Simmons, his father 
Michael, brother-in-law Adam Leach and Lee Miller were jailed in 
September last year after being convicted of fraud, while alleged conspirator John Bishop, 32, denies heading up one of the sales offices for the scam in Marbella, Spain, 
the Old Bailey was told.

Bishop was arrested in October last year after returning to the UK from Spain.

Adam Simmons set up No1 Gems, based in Hove, East Sussex, in late 2011 and conned investors for the best part of a year, the court heard.

By the time the company was raided by police in September 2012, they had closed down their operation and were preparing to start a similar firm called Pinnacle in nearby Eastbourne.

'Basically, No1 Gems were engaged in what is known as a boiler room fraud,' said David Durose, prosecuting.

‘It is a specific type of fraud in which individuals are targeted with cold calling and pressured into making purchases of items such as shares, equities or financial instruments - or in this case, diamonds.

‘They marked up the price by eight, ten or even up to nearly 30 times in order to determine the price they would be sold for.’

Mr Durose told the court that glossy brochures were sent out boasting employees at No1 Gems had more than 100 years’ experience in the jewel business.

He said the gang had also lied about the closure of diamond mines and a potential £15million deal to sell jewels to HSBC to get customers to part with their cash.

Retired William Doorbar, from Stoke, Staffordshire, was one of those targeted, the court heard.

He
 initially agreed to buy one 0.26 carat green diamond for £5,598 in 
March 2012 after a No1 Gems representative told him he could make annual
 returns upwards of 20 per cent.

‘It sounds like a good investment,’ said Mr Durose.

‘But the 20 per cent is how much the value of the diamond would go up, not how much he paid for it would go up.

‘Even if the rate came through, if the diamond was originally purchased for £350, after three years it would still be worth less than £1,000.

‘This was not an investment - this was a scam.’

Mr Doorbar was told that HSBC had agreed to buy the firm’s entire stock for £15.5million and offered the chance of buying three jewels to make a £38,000 profit in one month.

He was also told the Argyle diamond mine in Australia would shortly be closing and this would push up prices.

‘He was told it would only be a small amount of time before there was a huge return,’ said Mr Durose.

‘They suggested he consider taking out a loan if he could not afford it.’

Mr Doorbar bought a total of nine stones from the firm and used the last of his savings for his final £9,000 purchase.

No1 Gems agreed to refund him £3,000 when he raised suspicions - but the money never materialised.

Bishop, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, denies conspiracy to defraud and fraudulent trading between 31 October 2011 and 10 September 2012 and transferring criminal property.

The trial continues.
