San Diego Chargers outside linebacker Dwight Freeney had millions of dollars stolen by Micheal Stern, from Miami, who pretended to be an investor interested in the star's Hollywood restaurant

A former property developer who stole $3million (£1.8million) from NFL player Dwight Freeney has been jailed for five years.

Michael A Stern, 53, from Miami, used the money to pay for family vacations, jewellery, his children's private school tuition and legal bills from a bankruptcy case in Florida, according to court documents.

Stern claimed to be a wealthy businessman interested in investing in a Hollywood restaurant that Freeney owned in order to gain his trust.

The two were introduced in February 2010 through Stern's lover Eva Weinberg, who was also Freeney's business manager.

Stern then used information given to him by Weinberg to take millions of dollars from Freeney's accounts over more than a year.

Sensing that the FBI were about to arrest him, Freeney called somebody who turned out to be an informant and asked them to destroy a hard drive containing evidence in March 2012.

Police arrested him at Miami International Airport later the same month.

Stern pleaded guilty to fraud in January and was yesterday sentenced to five years in federal prison and ordered to pay Freeney $2.6million.

Weinberg pleaded guilty in June to a related count of accessory after the fact. She is set to be sentenced in December.

Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl pass rusher, is out for the season after having surgery.

Freeney's business partner, Eva Weinberg, who was also Stern's lover, gave Stern information he used to defraud the NFL player

The news comes just one day after a parking attendant was charged with stealing $225,000 from Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman Todd Herremans.

Robert Von Ryan, 37, of Philadelphia is alleged to have stolen Herremans bank details from his car while watching watching over players’ cars at the team hotel while they played at Lincoln Financial Field.

According to philly.com between 2009 and 2010 the man, who is not an Eagles employee, transferred the money from Herremans' account into his own.
