He's the son of a legendary footballer but Calum Best has become equally famous for his own love life - which is so prolific he admits to not knowing how many women he's slept with.

Now ensconced in a long term relationship, the 34-year-old - who  counts Peter Stringfellow among his childhood mentors - admits he still doesn't know if he can be monogamous.

In an interview with The Times, Calum paid tribute to his girlfriend of eight months, Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack, 24, but said that he is still aware of his own cheating 'demons'.

Calum and Brtish model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack have been dating since last year. Their relationship had been a secret, but was revealed after Calum starred in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year

Promoting his new book Second Best, a heartfelt memoir of growing up feeling unloved and overshadowed by a brilliant but neglectful father, Calum insists he's trying to turn over a new leaf.

After years on the party circuit in which he describes one of his lowest moments as involving 'hookers and coke', he considers himself reformed.

He said: 'I sometimes think to myself, I was so driven by women and sex and naughtiness before! And now, the thought of chasing girls doesn't appeal to me.' 

The LA-born hunk said he despaired of meeting someone he felt comfortable sober with, admitting he didn't have 'sober sex' for several years. 

'Peter Stringfellow looked after me,' says Calum of the night he was abandoned in a strip club by his father George Best. 'He took me under his wing. And he always has looked out for me, ever since'

When he was growing up Calum was surrounded by stars.

His mother Angie Best was a model and fitness instructor and after her marriage to George broke down she and her young son moved into Cher's guesthouse for a few years. 

As an adult, the handsome blonde went on to date a string of famous names himself, with ex-girlfriends including Kimberly Stewart, Lindsay Lohan, model Georgia Salpa, Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding and Elizabeth Jagger.

Calum dated Bianca Gascoigne, daughter of  footballer Paul Gascoigne, after the pair met on  reality TV show Celebrity Love Island. He was also romantically involved with Jayne Middlemiss on the same TV show

After starring in a second series of Celebrity Love Island in 2007, Calum and Rebecca Loos, who claimed she had an affair with David Beckham, got very steamy on screen and were rumoured to be dating

Now he still feels unable to shake the legacy of his father, a brilliant footballer who was legendary for his drinking and womanising.

Calum acknowledges in The Times: 'I know there are demons in there. I know I can go and cheat. There are some things to me that are my dad.'

But he's determined to change and has voiced regrets about his behaviour with women in the past, in particular a picture that captured him making a graphic gesture with his hand in front of a woman's face which he said was very 'rude'.

Calum says he resisted flirtations and come-ons from Celebrity Big Brother 2015 contestant Cami Li thanks to thoughts of his new girlfriend, model Ianthe Rose Cochrane-Stack

However, the former playboy is still fending off cheating scandals and recently denied he'd had an affair with beautician Sophia Mia Wayne, 22, from Bournemouth, who claims to have hooked up with the reality TV star just 72 hours after he left the Celebrity Big Brother house last month.

Calum added that during his time in the CBB house, explicit thoughts of his girlfriend were what helped him rebuff the advances of fellow contestant, glamour model Cami Li. 

But despite having never been in a monogamous relationship before, Calum is hopeful for his future with Ianthe Rose. 

'I'll give Ianthe credit, I've never felt this strongly about anybody,' he said, and even added that after taking a recent holiday together he now feels more connected to her than ever.
