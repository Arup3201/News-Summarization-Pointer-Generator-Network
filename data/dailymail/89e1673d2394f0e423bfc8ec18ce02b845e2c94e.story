While most of us would hit the gym or take up a sport in an effort to shed unwanted pounds, one woman has chosen a more unusual form of exercise.

Danielle Miller, 22, from Southampton, lost seven stone by taking up motocross racing, a physically demanding and risky form of motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits.

At 18st, Danielle was once too overweight to join in with her father and brothers while they enjoyed motorcycle racing.

Danielle used to eat unhealthy processed food and rarely cooked from scratch but decided to change her lifestyle when she grew tired of being embarrassed of her size

Today, Miss Miller is a motocross champion and says her life has completely changed since she slimmed down from size 22 to a svelte size 10.

She credits the regular training required to stay competitive in races with helping her to keep the weight off.

Miss Miller, of Southampton, said: 'I was sick of being embarrassed every time I looked at a photo of myself.

'I joined a slimming club and I soon started losing weight. Within the first week I dropped 10lb. I was amazed and I decided to stick with it. I kept to the healthy diet and ditched the junk food. I signed up to a gym and started going regularly.'

Miss Miller decided to try motocross racing in 2012, a year after she began her weight loss challenge, after being inspired by her father and brothers who are involved in the sport.

She said: 'I knew that if I wanted to compete, I had to train nearly every night of the week. It helps me maintain my slim figure.'

Today, two years after taking up the sport, she weighs 11st, having lost 7st.

She said: 'My dad has been into motocross for 40 years and both of my brothers have always taken part in races.

Danielle says she used to say at home in the evening in front of the TV and eat crisps and chocolate all night

Since starting motorcross Danielle has won the Southern Motocross ladies championship and achieved fifth place in the national league table for her category in 2012

Miss Miller trains every day at her local gym to stay in shape for her motocross racing

'I never took part when I was larger and always felt I was missing out. I’m not only able to take part now, but I’m pretty good.'

Miss Miller, who races with several clubs in her local area, won the Southern Motocross ladies championship and achieved fifth place in the national league table for her category in 2012.

She said: 'Now I race against men as well, I don’t just take part in the ladies championships. Dad is very proud of me, he spends a lot of time with me helping to fix my bike whenever it breaks.'

Miss Miller, a family welfare officer,
 says her new slim figure is down to a much healthier diet as well as 
regular exercise and training.

Danielle says: 'Losing all this weight has completely changed my life'

She said: 'When I got home in the evening I would just sit in front of the TV and eat crisps and chocolate all night.

'I used to eat rubbish junk food all the time and would rely on ready meals. My idea of cooking from scratch was chicken with supermarket ready-made sauce.

'Now I only ever cook from scratch and it is so much healthier. I eat lasagne, fresh fruit, vegetables and lots of protein like chicken and fish. I still eat a lot, but I only eat healthy food.

'Every night I am either in the gym or at the motocross track.'

Since losing weight Miss Miller has overcome embarrassment about her figure to pose for modelling shots.

She said: 'It’s only unpaid work, but I still find it very exciting.

'Back when I was larger I would shy away every time the camera came out. Now I feel really confident in my body. I can even wear shorts without feeling embarrassed.'

Miss Miller is now planning to fulfil a lifelong ambition by going skydiving.

She said: 'I have always wanted to have a go at it but you have to be under a certain weight to be allowed to. Now I can.

'Losing all this weight has completely changed my life. I used to sit at home every evening doing nothing and now I am a slim, motocross champion, who can skydive.'
