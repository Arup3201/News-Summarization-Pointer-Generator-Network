A Montana strip club patron was so unhappy with the service that he called 911 to complain - but in the end it was he who landed in trouble with the law.

William McDaniel, 53, from Butte, Montana, contacted police last Saturday night to complain that an exotic dancer refused to have sex with him at Sagebrush Sam's Nightclub in the town of Rocker.

Mr McDaniel explained to officers that he paid $350 for a private dance at the establishment but did not get the desired outcome.

Hey, big spender: William McDaniel, 53, pictured left and right in a booking photo, was charged with soliciting prostitution after calling police to complain that a stripper refused to have sex with him 

Montana hotspot: McDaniel paid $350 for a private dance at Sagebrush Sam's Nightclub in the town of Rocker, Montana, but the performance came to an end after he allegedly became 'sexually aggressive' 

The X-rated performance was supposed to include multiple songs, but when McDaniel became 'sexually aggressive,' according to police, the lap dance came to an abrupt end.

‘He felt he was ripped off by the bar,’ Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich told the Helena Independent Record.

The patron's laments, however, fell on deaf ears since under state law it is illegal to offer money in exchange for sexual favors.

Mr McDaniel, who until recently was employed by a company specializing in contamination cleanups, was arrested and charged with misdemeanor soliciting prostitution.

Checkered past: McDaniel, pictured left at work on his birthday earlier this month, has prior convictions for DUIs and drug possession 

The unsatisfied customer was released Sunday after posting bond.

According to jail records, McDaniel’s criminal history includes convictions for felony DUIs and possession of dangerous drugs.

There is no indication that Mr McDaniel is married, but according to his Facebook page, the 53-year-old has at least two young grandchildren.
