The number of aggrieved workers bringing sex discrimination claims to employment tribunals has tumbled by 90 per cent in a year since claimants were made to pay a fee.

It appears that the prospect of forking out in advance – and losing the money if their case fails – is deterring many of those who may be tempted to use a tribunal to make their employer pay compensation.

But Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna has promised to abolish the fees, claiming they are unfair.

Figures published yesterday by the Ministry of Justice showed there were 6,310 sex discrimination cases in the three months before the charges were introduced in July last year. During the same period of this year, there were just 591 – a 90 per cent fall. Race discrimination claims are down 60 per cent, from 1,089 to 422.

Overall, 44,334 claims of all types were made to tribunals between April and June 2013. By this spring the figure was just 8,540 – a fall of 81 per cent.

The situation contrasts sharply with that in 2008. Then, sex discrimination cases were running at almost 27,000 a year, just before the recession made jobs more valuable and claims less common.

In the financial year that ended last March, there were still 18,814 claims made. But the new fee system is having such an impact that there will be fewer than 2,500 made this year if the pattern of this spring continues.

Workers who want to bring a tribunal case in a straightforward argument over an employers’ alleged failure to pay them their proper wages now have to pay a fee of £390.

Discrimination cases, most of which involve allegations of sex or race bias, cost £1,200. The poorest claimants can have their fees waived or reduced. If claimants win, the tribunal can order the employer to cover the cost of their fees. But if they lose, they must foot the bill themselves.

The fees have been welcomed by employers, who face an average cost of £8,500 each time a case is brought. But they have produced a wave of protests from union leaders, lawyers and Labour politicians.

Earlier this week, Mr Umunna told the TUC a Labour government would abolish the fee system and replace it with a means-test one that ‘ensures all workers have proper access to justice’.Richard Fox, head of employment law at legal firm Kingsley Napsley, said: ‘We really have reached the situation where many voices are coming together to say something must be done.

‘There is now a serious question of access to justice on account of the level at which fees were introduced. It can be no coincidence that Chuka Umunna took the opportunity at this week’s TUC conference to propose a new system for dealing with this issue.’

But Tory Justice Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘Hard-working taxpayers should not be picking up the bill for employment disputes in tribunals, and it is reasonable to expect people to contribute towards the £74million bill for the service.’

He added: ‘It is important to remember the Government has taken measures to ensure that those who have limited means ... are not excluded from seeking redress in tribunals.

‘The Government is on the side of people who want to work hard and get on.’
