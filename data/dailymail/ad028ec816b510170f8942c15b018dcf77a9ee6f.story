Nearly 100 wildfires have been burning out of control across Australia's most populous state today. 

Several homes are believed to have been destroyed in the fires across New South Wales. 

Exact numbers are not known because conditions are too intense for firefighters to reach the hardest-hit areas, said Rural Fire Service spokesman Matt Sun.

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths. 

Unseasonably, hot temperatures and strong winds have been fanning the flames across the parched landscape.

Smoke from the fires blocked the sun over downtown Sydney, casting an eerie, orange haze across the city.

A cool front swept through the region as darkness fell bringing temperatures down.

But strong winds accompanying the front sent flames racing in new directions, bringing fresh misery to the 1,400 firefighters battling the blazes. 

Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said: 'This is as bad as it gets.'

The extent of the damage won't be known before dawn on Friday, authorities said.

Wildfires are common throughout Australia in the warmer months.

In February 2009, wildfires killed 173 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes in Victoria state.

In
January, Australia’s meteorologists were forced to create a new weather
chart as they prepared for the worst wildfires on record, with national
parks evacuated and homes continuing to burn.

The
Bureau of Meteorology added deep purple and pink to their weather 
chart's colours as its range was extended to 54°C from a previously 
capped 50°C, in anticipation of record temperatures.
