The Kardashian sisters are so close that they seem to share everything - and that includes style ideas.

Eldest Kardashian sibling Kourtney arrived at Kim's Beverly Hills home today wearing a similar outfit to the one her younger sister wore last Friday.

The 32-year-old looked happy with her outfit choice of high-waisted peach shorts, a white lace top, sky-high camel stiletto sandals and wide, sable-coloured belt.

She was a dead ringer for the 30-year-old soon-to-be-married Kim, who wore a puffy orange 
skirt, white top and off-white heels to a meeting at West Hollywood's 
Pacific Design Centre last Friday.

It isn't any wonder that the ladies borrow one another's style given their very active adventures in fashion retail.

Along with youngest sister Khloe, the girls own and operate D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique with locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York City.

They have also jointly released a 20-piece jewellery line for Virgins, Saints and Angels which debuted in March 2010.

In the spring of 2010, the ladies collaborated with bebe; both Kim and 
Khloe, 26, are pictured below wearing the same dress from their 
collection.

Most recently the girls debuted their QVC-exclusive line K-Dash in September of 2010.

Next up for the Armenian sisters is the launch of their Kardashian Kollection for Sears.

Who looks best in the dress? Kourtney isn't the only Kardashian that copies Kim's style - younger sister Khloe does, as well. Here, the girls both wear dresses from their own line for bebe

The
three brunette beauties will all be on hand to celebrate the private 
launch of their new line at Hollywood hostpot The Colony on 17 August.

Handbags, lingerie, belts, dresses and heels will all be available for retail this week.

But while it's alright for the women to copy one another's style, they're in a bit of hot water for allegedly knocking off someone else's.

According to Women's Wear Daily, accessories designer Monica Botkier has filed a cease and desist letter against the retail giant, who have since pulled the bag from its website.

She took to her website's blog to grouse: 'We just discovered how our Botkier ‘Clyde’ was simply copied by Kardashian Kollection for Sears. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery but we don’t think so ...'

Ms. Botkier might feel differently had she been born a Kardashian.

It's in the bag: Monica Botkier's Clyde is on the left and the Kardashian Kollection for Sears purse is on the right. Do you think they look alike?
