Essien played under Ancelotti during his two-season stint in charge of Chelsea and the 31-year-old can see shades of the Italian in Inzaghi.

'I really like him as a coach', he told Sky Italia.

'He wants us to entertain and express ourselves on the pitch and this inspires us to give our best.

'I have played under many coaches in my career and Inzaghi reminds me of Ancelotti, who trained me at Chelsea. He also allowed his players to express themselves on the pitch and I think it is the right thing to do.'

Milan travel to Verona on Sunday as they look to close the gap on league leaders Juventus.
