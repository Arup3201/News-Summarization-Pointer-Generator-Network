British police are to head to Thailand to help investigate the brutal murder of two British backpackers last month, David Cameron said last night.

The Prime Minister confronted the Thai military ruler at a summit of European and Asian leaders and demanded UK police be involved in the much-criticised probe.

David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found dead on the holiday island of Koh Tao in September.

Two Burmese migrants have been charged with their murders, but there are doubts over the legal process - with claims the pair were tortured before confessing.

The Thai prime minister, who took power following a coup in May, had previously rejected all offers of help. But now he has changed his mind - meaning detectives could fly out in weeks.

Mr Cameron’s intervention mirrors the decision to send Met Police detectives to Portugal to help investigate the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

British police have also been to Libya to probe the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the country’s London embassy in the 1980s.

The agreement came in a face-to-face discussion of the controversy surrounding the probe between Mr Cameron and military ruler Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, the Thai prime minister, at a summit in Milan.

Detectives are expected to focus on independent checks of DNA samples central to the case against two Burmese men accused of the crime and their claims to have been mistreated.

The semi-naked bodies of David Miller, 24, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge were found on the idyllic Sairee beach of the holiday island of Koh Tao last month.

Court proceedings have reportedly started against the two suspects amid international concern about the way the case has been handled by the Thai authorities.

During a meeting between Thai diplomat Nadhavathna Krishnamra and Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire this week, concern was raised about how the Thai authorities had handled the investigation, including that police had spoken openly to the media since the murders.

The Thai leader had previously rejected offers of help and insisted the UK no longer had ‘any more doubts’ about the quality of the investigation following ambassador-level talks.

‘They simply needed more time to understand it all because we managed to arrest suspects swiftly, even though it seemed impossible at the beginning,’ he was reported to have said.

But diplomatic sources said he had finally accepted the sending of a delegation of British police when pressed on the issue by Mr Cameron at the Asia Europe Meeting in Italy.

‘Obviously it is for the Thai authorities to lead and carry out that judicial process,’ a diplomatic source said.

‘But it is important that it is fair and transparent and that both of the families can be reassured that it is the murderers that have been brought to justice.’

The source added: ‘There are two areas we are particularly concerned about. One if the verification of the DNA samples of the suspects, making sure there is further independent verification.

‘And the second is the investigation into allegations of mistreatment of the suspects.

‘What the PM secured this morning was agreement from the Thai PM that we can send some British police investigators to Kho Tao to work with the Royal Thai Police on this.’

Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.

The Burmese workers who have been charged with the killings were paraded in front of the cameras after apparently making confessions, which were reportedly later withdrawn.

The suspects, named in reports as 21-year-old bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, were charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery.

But later reports - denied by the Thai police - suggested that a Burmese embassy official had formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured.

The families of the Burmese workers have said they are innocent, claiming the case has been rigged against them.

The families of the accused men told the BBC they believe they did not commit the crime, with Win Zaw Htun’s mother adding that the ordeal has left her suicidal.

‘The case has been rigged against my son,’ said Zaw Lin’s mother.

In the days after the murders, Prayuth Chan-O-Cha was forced to apologise for suggesting beautiful tourists put themselves at risk by wearing bikinis.

The Thai PM, who seized power in a coup in May, was reported to say pretty women made themselves more vulnerable to attacks by wearing a bikini

He said: ‘There are always problems with tourist safety.

‘They think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want, they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere.

‘Can they be safe in bikinis… unless they are not beautiful?’
