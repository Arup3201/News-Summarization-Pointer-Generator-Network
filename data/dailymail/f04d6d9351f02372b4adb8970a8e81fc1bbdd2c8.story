Paul Gascoigne was a familiar figure in London's cars and clubs, often accompanied by footballer friends like David Seaman

He added: 'I do miss a pint. I’ll never say never. I might drink again in the future', the Daily Star reports.

He said while he had his 'eye on the ball' he does have an addictive personality and often got 'too excited' after one drink.

grateful' for the help given to him by his friends
