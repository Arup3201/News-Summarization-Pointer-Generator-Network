Denis Livesley, 60, was loading a crashed Volvo onto his recovery truck on a slip road off the M60 when a Volkswagen Golf skidded on ice and hit him

A tow truck driver was mown down by a runaway car only to be left dying in the road - as other motorists drove round him.

Denis Livesley, 60, was loading a crashed Volvo onto his vehicle on a motorway when a Volkswagen Golf skidded on ice and ploughed into him.

But instead of stopping to help, drivers in other cars swerved round Mr Livesley as he lay face down on the inside lane of a slip road on the M60 near Sale, Greater Manchester.

According to witnesses, some drivers had so little regard for the dying man, they even edged their cars past the Golf which had hit him because they did not want to be held up.

Mr Livesley, from Oldham, who once worked as a roadie for Elton John and Sting was eventually attended to by passers-by including a doctor and then an ambulance crew but was pronounced dead on arrival at Trafford General Hospital.

The shocking 'walk on by' scenario emerged as a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest into Mr Livesley's death which occurred in December 2009.

Laura Warmoth, who was travelling to work, told the Stockport hearing: 'It was horrific. I couldn't believe my eyes as I witnessed motorists manoeuvring around him and driving off without stopping.

'They had little or no regard for the man. It appeared all they were bothered about was getting past and getting on their journey.

'They were swerving past the tailgate of the Golf. It was like a game. I found it very disturbing.'

Mrs Warmoth said she stopped her car at an angle to block the traffic and then went over to Mr Livesley who was said to be motionless.

Mr Livesley, a grandfather of eight, had been loading the Volvo, which had crashed into a barrier due to the weather conditions, onto his truck near junction 6 when he was hit by the Volkswagen.

Police had earlier attended the crash and advised the Volvo driver, Paul Harrington, to stand behind the crash barriers but had left after seeing Highways Agency officers arrive.

Highways Agency officer Reece Newell 
told the court he and his colleague Nicola Jones had twice asked if Mr 
Harrington would like them to stay but he had declined.

'We
also offered him a foil blanket and told him there was a telephone box 
he could call and we would be back within ten to 15 minutes. There was 
no reason for us to stay at the scene,' he added.

The
VW driver, Sophie Wilkinson, 23, a veterinary student from Bolton, was 
twice interviewed by police but no action was taken. She denied having 
driven over snow-covered chevron markings that separate Junction 7 from 
the motorway network.

But lawyers will now reopen the files after Coroner John Pollard asked the Crown Prosecution Service to review the decision.

Mr Pollard said he also would write to the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and to the Highways Agency asking them to look at their protocols and ensure the safety of recovery drivers who are called to pick up cars following motorway crashes.

He said officers from both organisations who were called to the scene had obeyed their organisations' procedures.

But he added: 'It does seem to me that, in the prevailing weather conditions, the emergency services ought to have considered not just the safety of the driver whose car had been involved in a crash but also the safety of anyone who is required to recover the driver of that vehicle.'

As well as working for GM Recovery Limited, Mr Livesley drove stars such as Pink Floyd, Elton John and Sting across Europe delivering their stage equipment.

Nadia Kerr, a partner at Pannone 
solicitors, which is to file a civil action on behalf of Mr Livesley's 
family against the VW driver, said: 'The family would welcome a decision
from the CPS that they will now prosecute.

'We
expect to have a response from the CPS in a few weeks. The situation 
was the police and the Highways Agency had responded to the car that had
spun off the road. Denis was clearing that damaged vehicle when he was 
killed.

'When he got 
there only the damaged vehicle and the driver were at the scene. There 
is currently no protocol in place as to whether the police should have 
stayed at the scene for the protection of recovery drivers.

'We
don't know what the reason is for the unlawful killing verdict. We 
asked the coroner what the background was to the verdict but the jury 
didn't record it in the inquisition so there is no explanation for it.'

Mr Livesley also worked for Pink Floyd. His widow, Wendy, said that her late husband 'got to know quite a few of the celebrities, who all really valued the work he did for them'

Mr Livesley's widow, Wendy, 38, said after the verdict: 'The whole family has been absolutely devastated by Denis's death. At least the inquest provided answers as to precisely what happened on the day Denis died.

'We now want lessons to be learned from the mistakes that were made so that no-one else doing the job Denis died dies in the same circumstances.'

'Denis lived for his work and it was typical of him that he went to this job when really his area of work was really dealing with the recovery of heavy goods vehicles. He probably went because he knew he'd have been able to help but his dedication brought about his death.

'Denis got to know quite a few of the celebrities, who all really valued the work he did for them.

'He was married before to someone also called Wendy who sadly died from cancer and when he got the call on tour in Europe to say she had become critically ill, Sting paid for him to be flown home immediately. That's how much people thought of him.

'He was so kind and generous, once when he was in Bosnia just after the troubles there, he came home with no shoes! He'd given them to a Bosnian who he said 'needed them more than me'. That was my Denis; he'd do anything for anyone.'
