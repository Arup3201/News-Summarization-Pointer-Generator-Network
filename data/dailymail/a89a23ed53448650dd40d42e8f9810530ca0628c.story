Kings Cross identity John Ibrahim has hit out at police telling them to be 'smarter' when investigating the recent attempt on his youngest brother Michael's life.

It is the third attempt on an Ibrahim brother's life in the past five years with eldest brother Sam shot twice in his legs outside his mother's home  in 2011, while Fadi was sitting in his Lamborghini outside his home in 2009 when when shot five times.

John Ibrahim tells police to do a 'better job' with the investigation into his brother Micheal's shooting

'I hope this time around the police can be a bit smarter,' John told The Daily Telegraph.

'I hope they can spend a bit more time investigating this and do better job than they have done with the other (shootings).'

However, a NSW Police spokesman hit back saying Michael was no longer cooperating with police and pointed out that investigations were 'considerably enhanced' when the victims cooperated with officers.

In the days leading up to the shooting of Michael  on Sunday night, the family of a Sydney crime figure allegedly attempted to broker peace.

Ibrahim was hit in the shoulder by one of a number of bullets fired at him on his way home in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD. 

After his release from jail, where he served six years for manslaughter, the younger brother of Kings Cross nightclub identity John Ibrahim had reportedly started a new relationship and became embroiled in a life of partying.

The Sun Herald reported that Ibrahim, 36, had been seen at Cafe Del Mar in Darling Harbour, and the 'floating beach club'. 

Sources reported Ibrahim had used his new freedom to reconnect with a south-Western Sydney crime figure, before the relationship soured and the man's family intervened.

Despite the alleged attempt to ease tensions, animosity escalated between the pair, before Ibrahim was hospitalised by the shooting. 

Ibrahim's brother, Kings Cross nighclub identity John Ibrahim, visited him in hospital, and the 36-year-old has been sitting up and in good spirits in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon.

Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery, correcting earlier information.

Police are hunting for a gunman after a man was shot while standing on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night

Meanwhile, police continued their investigation at the scene of the attack on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments.

Police are looking for at least two attackers and a white, possibly late model, Audi.    

Ibrahim spent more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006.

He was acquitted in 2012 of conspiring to murder nightclub owner John Macris, who he believed was responsible for gunning down his brother, Fadi Ibrahim, outside a home in Sydney's north. 

Macris was not charged over the incident. 

Sam Ibrahim has been behind bars on firearms charges since his bail was revoked in July last year.   

A crime scene remained on Monday outside Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home where he has lived since he left prison in August 2014

Several shots were fired, with a bullet removed from this tree at the scene of the shooting, but Ibrahim only was only shot by one bullet to the shoulder

The shooting took place on Macquarie Street just 200 metres from NSW Parliament House (pictured)

Police closed off Macquarie Street shortly after the shooting between Bridge and Bent streets as police scoured the area for bullet casings. 

Apart from the man's gunshot wound, police have received no further reports of injuries. 

The shooting took place outside a multi-storey office building at 151 Macquarie Street - just 200 metres away from NSW Parliament House and less than 300 metres from the scene of the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place. 

Michael Ibrahim had earlier vowed to move on with his life at his August 2014 parole hearing.

He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the 'most stringent' parole conditions.

Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a 'wake up call', he told the parole board.

He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney.  

Mr Ibrahim was sentenced to a maximum nine years and four months behind bars for his role in the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006
