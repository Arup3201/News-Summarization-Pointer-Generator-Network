Former director general: Mark Thompson claimed the BBC Trust was aware of a controversial payoff worth almost £1million given to a senior executive

The BBC’s former director general Mark Thompson yesterday accused its governing body of misleading MPs over a £949,000 severance payoff to one of its top executives.

A war of words – described by MPs as a ‘soap opera’ – exploded between Mr Thompson and the BBC Trust as emails emerged that cast doubt on the evidence given by its chairman Chris Patten to a Commons inquiry.

Lord Patten told the public accounts committee on Wednesday the Trust had not been given details of the  massive payment to former deputy director Mark Byford, who was made redundant in 2010.

Asked whether he felt he should have been told the details of the deal, Lord Patten said: ‘Yes, and if you call in due course the previous director general of the BBC I will be as interested as you are as to why we didn’t know.’

However correspondence has now emerged showing Mr Thompson, head of the BBC executive at the time, informed the Trust that Byford and his colleague Sharon Baylay, director of marketing, would be given ‘maximum payments’.

An email from his office, dated October 8, 2010, stated they would not be served formal notice of their redundancy until ‘calendar year 2011’, despite being informed of their departure months earlier.

The revelation triggered a war of words between Mr Thompson and the Trust – prompting the public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge to brand the whole affair a ‘soap opera’.

She said: ‘There are serious accusations flying around about whether or not the director general was open and honest with the Trust, and counter-accusations about whether the Trust was open and honest with us.

‘It is becoming a soap opera, and we need to get to the bottom of it.’

Hearing: Asked yesterday why he did not know some payoffs had gone beyond what was contractually needed, Lord Patten appeared to suggest to the Public Accounts Committee that Mr Thompson should give evidence

Miss Hodge said she now plans to hold a
fresh inquiry with a raft of current and former executives – including 
Mr Thompson and former chairman Sir Michael Lyons – expected to be 
called as witnesses.

The hearing follows a devastating report by the 
National Audit Office, which found the BBC handed out £369million to its
staff over eight years. In it, the Byford deal was held up for special 
criticism.

The NAO found he was wrongly paid 
£474,500 for 12 months’ ‘pay in lieu of notice’, despite serving eight 
months of his notice period on full pay. It meant he was effectively 
paid twice for that period and pocketed almost twice what he was 
contractually entitled to.

Lord Patten admitted to MPs the Trust 
had been made aware of the pay-off in Mr Thompson’s email, but claimed 
it had been assured it was ‘within contractual terms’.

But yesterday, Mr Thompson, who left 
the BBC in September to become CEO of the New York Times Company, 
accused the Trust of ‘inaccuracies’. A close friend said he was 
‘gobsmacked and surprised’ to hear Lord Patten’s evidence.

Big payoff: Former deputy director general Mark Byford left the BBC after 31 years of service with around £950,000 when his post closed

Mr Thompson said the Trust was ‘fully 
informed in advance, in writing as well as orally, about the proposed 
severance packages for Mark Byford and [marketing director] Sharon 
Baylay’.

He added: ‘Specifically, they were 
told it was proposed that in both cases formal notice would not be 
served immediately but in the following year… I had made sure the Trust 
were aware of and understood all potentially contentious issues. The 
Trust had every opportunity to express any concerns about the proposals 
before they were approved.’

Trust member Anthony Fry had told MPs yesterday that members of the Trust were not always included in decision-making.

Mr Thompson, who had been expected to 
appear before the public accounts committee in November, is now likely 
to be called to give evidence earlier.

A Trust spokesman said: ‘The material 
being quoted today was shared with the NAO in the course of their 
review. They noted that the Trust had no role in the approval process 
but were being given this material for information and to provide 
assurance that payments to Mark Byford and Sharon Baylay were to be made
on the basis of contractual terms.

‘The NAO’s conclusions were the basis 
for our evidence given to the PAC yesterday and like the NAO, we see 
nothing in this correspondence which disproves any of their 
conclusions.’

Salary: Head of HR Lucy Adams was branded as 'disingenuous' about her own pay

The Corporation’s director of human resources was branded as ‘disingenuous’ about her own salary while giving evidence to MPs.

Lucy Adams signed off many of the most contentious pay-offs, including the Byford deal.

When Margaret Hodge quizzed her on her own £320,000 salary, she said she had accepted a  ‘significant drop’ to join the BBC.

However, documents seen by the Daily Mail reveal she was given a ‘higher level of guaranteed salary’ than in her previous job as HR head of legal firm Eversheds.

Yesterday, Tory MP Richard Bacon said: ‘Do I find it surprising some witnesses are somewhat disingenuous? No.’

Minutes from the BBC remuneration committee in February 2009 said: ‘Although the total proposed is lower than the package Lucy can currently potentially earn, it has a higher level of guaranteed salary and lower element of variable pay.’

Miss Adams told MPs she felt ‘uncomfortable’ signing off the Byford deal, but said it was in line with a ‘pervading culture’, adding: ‘I think as an organisation we made a number of decisions which were not in the best interests of the licence fee payer.’
