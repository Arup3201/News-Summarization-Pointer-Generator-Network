Smash and grab raiders left expensive handbags littered across a street in central London as they fled from a robbery on a designer shop.

Luxury luggage brand Moynat's flagship store in London was the target of the break in, which occurred in the early hours of this morning.

In their hurry to flee the store following the robbery, the thieves left a number of the expensive bags - which start from around £800 - strewn across the road outside the shop in Mayfair.

Sought after: Moynat bags have been sported by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and model Natalia Vodianova

The three suspects are thought to have left the scene on two mopeds.

The French chain, sported by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and model Natalia Vodianova, only opened its shop in prestigious Mount Street in March this year, its first outside France.

Police sealed off the area outside the red-brick shop front, as officers inspected the scene of the raid.

No arrests have been made.

The shop was open as normal today. A spokesman for the chain was not available for comment tonight.

The value of the items taken is unknown.

In
 March this year thieves had attempted to break into a Christian Dior 
shop in central London, fleeing before they could take anything.

A
 similar theft was carried out at the flagship Gucci store off Sloane 
Square last year, where dozens of designer handbags were stolen, 
including a £30,000 limited edition crocodile bag, which formed part of a
 £100,000 haul.

Earlier this
 month raiders smashed five glass display cases in the foyer of the 
Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair, stealing watches and jewellery worth tens 
of thousands of pounds, before speeding off through the city on three 
mopeds.
