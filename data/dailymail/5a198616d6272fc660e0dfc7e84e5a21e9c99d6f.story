It is easy to understand why England's coaches felt Dan Cole could cope with an in-at-the-deep-end return to Test rugby. The Leicester prop is a master of understatement, which perfectly illustrates his unflappable nature.

One stock response sums up the tighthead's measured outlook. Asked about the prospect of starting against Wales in Cardiff, after a year out of the international game due to injury, he calmly conceded: 'It's not ideal.'

Asked to reflect on England's capitulation at the Millennium Stadium two years ago, he said: 'It wasn't ideal' - different tense, same sentiment.

Cole, 27, has been thrown straight back into England's starting front row, after six weeks out with a foot injury - following nine months on the sidelines with a serious neck problem - because Bath's David Wilson has been ruled out.

Wilson also has neck damage, leaving the Lion for whom he often deputised to fill the void at short notice.

When Cole made his autumn comeback for the Tigers after surgery, he later admitted that he was not so much worried about his neck as the uncomfortable prospect that he might be 'rubbish' after so long out of the game.

He need not have worried about that and he will not be concerned about what awaits on Friday night - a 49th Test cap and a head-to-head scrum collision with the wily Welsh loosehead, Gethin Jenkins.

Cole's lack of game time is alleviated by an abundance of experience. He feels ready.

'Confident? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't,' he said. 'Yes, it's not the most ideal entrance to the Test scene, but I got the nine months (absence) out of the system with the eight games I played for Leicester. We had Toulon back-to-back and the Saints, so they were hardly easy games.

'You believe in the conditioning and it's not like I've done nothing over the past few weeks. I feel as best prepared as I can be. It's about getting the sharpness back. It's not like you are starting at square one when you come back in.'

England forwards coach Graham Rowntree insisted that there is minimal risk involved in asking Cole to resume his starting role without a suitable build-up.

'Dan is a class, proven operator,' he said. 'He's not been out for six months and he's not been twiddling his thumbs for the last six weeks. We have trained pretty fast and he's slotted in nicely. His knowledge doesn't dissipate over six weeks. Dealing with environments like Friday night comes with experience. It's good to have him around.'

When he turns his focus on to the grim ordeal England endured at the Millennium Stadium in 2013, Cole's recollections of the game and the occasion are typically moderate.

'It wasn't ideal,' he said. 'You remember the day - it wasn't really a high point. It was loud. You are playing in front of 80,000 people and it's loud. It was probably a step up from what I have played in front of at the Millennium Stadium before.

'The Welsh did live off that atmosphere but I wouldn't say it threw us off our game. Both teams feed off the crowd because it provides energy.'

The interruption to his career caused by a rare injury allowed Cole to take a long-overdue rest and he has returned fresh and 'a touch heavier', which won't be a prospect to encourage Jenkins.

'I'm in better nick than I was before,' said the man charged with anchoring England's set-piece assault. If he says that, it must be true, because even mild hyperbole is not his style.
