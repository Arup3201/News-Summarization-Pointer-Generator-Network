Barcelona ace Neymar posted a selfie alongside team-mates Dani Alves and Luis Suarez while on-board a flight to the Spanish capital to take on Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. 

The South American trio looked extremely relaxed hours before they are scheduled to take on their La Liga rivals. 

Neymar, Alves and Suarez all started against Carlo Ancelotti's side as Barcelona look to extend their three-point lead at the top of the table.

Much of the focus will be on Suarez as the former Liverpool forward who will make his Barcelona debut after serving a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup.

Barcelona manager Luis Enrique will take charge of his first El Clasico since taking over the reins at the Nou Camp. 

The Catalan giants received a boost when Gareth Bale was ruled out of Saturday's encounter but the likes of Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba will still have to find a way of stopping Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez.
