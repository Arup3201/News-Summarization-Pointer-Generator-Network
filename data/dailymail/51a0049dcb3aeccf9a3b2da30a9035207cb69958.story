Petr Cech has been warned by Jose Mourinho that he expects him to ‘fight against my decision’ if the manager opts to make Thibaut Courtois his first-choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season.

Courtois, 22, has joined Chelsea on their pre-season tour with the rest of the Belgian contingent following their post-World Cup rest and he is set to start in Sunday's friendly at Werder Bremen.

Cech, 32, has indicated he will not be happy warming the bench but the manager is adamant there will be no sentimentality in the fight for the goalkeeping position.

Battle: Cech and Courtois will battle against each other for the Chelsea number one spot this season

He said: ‘Before I had Carlo Cudicini and then I made the decision to give Petr the goal so, if I have to make the decision of putting Petr on the bench, it’s not a problem for me.

‘If I have to put Courtois on the bench, it is not a problem. The fact that we have two fantastic goalkeepers is not a problem for me. It was logical that Courtois had to be back. 

'It would make no sense to have such a great young keeper and not have him back. In the end it will be my decision and nobody else’s.

Experience: Cech will have to be wary of Courtois as he looks to extend his Chelsea career

‘They have to work hard and wait for my decision, then fight against my decision if they are on the bench.’

Mourinho has little truck with the suggestion that dissatisfaction from Cech (right) could precipitate his departure.

‘Everybody says the same,’ he said. ‘If somebody says I’m happy on the bench, then what are you doing here? Petr says the obvious, Courtois says the same. Mark Schwarzer is 42 and he will say he’s not happy being the third choice and will fight hard to try and be No2 again.’
