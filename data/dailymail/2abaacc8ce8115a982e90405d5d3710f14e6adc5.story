Arsenal winger Theo Walcott and his wife Melanie have spoken out over the distressing ordeal they had to go through during the birth of their son Finley.

The couple, speaking to Hello! magazine, learned their newborn baby had a heart defect shortly after his birth just under a year ago.

Walcott's wife said it was 'the longest two and a half hours of our lives' during Finley's operation to correct the problem with his heart.

Melanie and Arsenal star Walcott were left scared and emotional after the birth of Finley on April 10, 2014

Melanie said: 'Finley had a routine check and they found a murmur, which, again is normal. But it should go after 24 hours.

'But it didn't and it was discovered he had a valve that wasn't working properly. Basically, the heart was having to work really hard to get the blood to his lungs, which meant that the right side of his heart was getting bigger.

'Theo and I were so new to it all, you suddenly feel so vulnerable because it is all taken out of your control. You've got this little person who is the most precious thing in the world and who you have this overwhelming urge to protect. It was a scary and emotional time.

'It was the longest two and a half hours of our lives but the staff were fantastic. Theo and I just tried to keep strong for each other.'

Finley, who will turn one on April 10, has made a full recovery since the operation at Royal Brompton hospital in London.

Meanwhile, Walcott will be hoping to feature against Manchester United on Monday night as Arsenal look to seal a place in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.
