The Powell family have released never-seen-before home video to fight the opinion that Susan Cox-Powell was frightened of her father-in-law Steven Powell before she went missing in 2009. 

The website was unveiled by Steven Powell's daughter Alina and shows Susan and her husband Joshua spending time with their young sons Charlie and Braden. 

It came as the jury began deliberating this morning in Tacoma, Washington over the trial of Steven Powell who is accused of 14 counts of voyeurism - including charges that he  filmed and photographed two girls, aged eight and ten, as they used the bathroom in the home behind his home in 2006.

They had not reached a decision by the end of Tuesday. Powell faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of 14 counts against him. If convicted of all counts, he could face up to 70 years in prison.

A jury of 12 men and women and two alternates were finally selected out of 70, who had to answer questions about whether or not they were biased or had formed an opinion on the high-profile case.

Powell, 62, is the father-in-law of Susan Powell, who disappeared from her home in West Valley City, Utah, in late 2009.

The new website, West Valley and Pierce County Malfeasance, featured tapes of the Powell family and 'Grandpa Steve' visiting a dam, playing at a park, walking on the beach and making dinner together.

Togetherness: The family of Steven Powell, who is standing trial on voyeurism charges, released the unseen footage to show the world that Susan Powell was not afraid for herself or her sons to be around her father-in-law

One video is addressed to Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox, another to Jennifer Graves, an estranged sister of the Powell family, and later a friend of Susan Powell's Kiirsi Hellewell who told various TV stations how much Mrs Powell did not like her father-in-law.

The site stated: 'If Susan had really thought that Steve Powell were a danger to her children, as the police are trying to claim, there's no way she would have allowed him access to her children in so carefree a manner as demonstrated in the videos.

'Susan was a caring mother and an excellent judge of character. The police have misrepresented Susan's writings in bad faith.'

Publishing the site was aimed at giving the Powell family's side in the ongoing feud with Susan's family who believe her husband and father-in-law had something to do with her disappearance.

For the past two years, Joshua Powell had been the only true person-of-interest in the case.

He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am back in 2009. He said he believed his wife ran off with another man.

Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains.

In February, Susan's husband Josh Powell, attacked Braden, seven, and Charlie, five with a hatchet and ignited an explosive fire in which he and the boys died at his Washington home.

Among the images recovered from Steve Powell's home were many of Susan Powell that appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge, investigators said.

There were also journals in which Steve Powell detailed his obsession with Susan Powell, they said.

Much of that evidence has been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against the defendant. Steve Powell was not charged with acts of voyeurism involving Susan Powell because authorities can't prove she didn't know about the filming.

Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said it was obvious that the images of Susan were recorded without her permission.

'Clearly their strongest evidence on anything is on Susan being a victim,' Cox said. 'I don't get it. Does she not count?'
