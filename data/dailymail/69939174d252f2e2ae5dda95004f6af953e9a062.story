A British jihadist fighting with the mujahideen in Syria has confessed that he misses Coco Pops and wants to open a milkshake shop after the war.

The 19-year-old, who claims that he walked across the border with Turkey to join a group fighting Bashir Assad's forces last night took part in a live web Q&A with wannabe jihadists.

During the online livechat he incited children as young as 16 to 'put their faith in Allah' and join the holy war. It didn't matter if you are weak and scrawny he said, although 'it helps' if you are good at jogging.

(File picture) A British teenager - who claimed to be a jihadist - tried to recruit youngsters on the site ask.fm

The teenager responded to questions on the social media website askfm, using the alias Abu Dujana.

During the insightful question session, he described wages for jihadists - $40 a month plus $40 for each family member - and detailed some of the hardships of war, the scarcity of food on the frontline and going to the toilet in a hole in the mountain.

He said he had flown to Turkey, several months ago, and crossed the border easily before joining his group. If caught by authorities 'just say you are a journalist', he counselled.

The young mujahideen said he accepts he cannot return to Britain on pain of jail, but so far he did not miss life back home. He said: 'Saving lives is better than a red passport', adding, 'I only miss my family, nothing else. Ok I miss coco pops, i admit that...'

He explained: 'What motivates me is that the muslims of sham are being killed, tortured and raped and as muslims we must believe that they are also family.'

The British Muslim admitted that his family had suffered as a result of his decision.

The jihadist claimed one of the things he missed while in Syria was Coco Pops

Ask.fm is a site where users can ask each other questions and get answers

In one post describing his mother's anguish he said: 'She found it very hard but in sha Allah, Allah will help her cope. Many parents change their minds after a while as they look into Jihad and begin to understand.'

One doubtful young potential recruit asked if he had to be strong and fit to join up. But the 19-year-old soldier said anyone could serve. He said: 'Im weak also. There are skinny brothers, fat brothers, even disabled. Everyone is accepted.

'You dont need physical strength, just be good at jogging. but even if you cant jog much no problem'.

Another asked: 'How can i come i am in america and only 16' and was told 'Put your trust in Allah and come to Turkey border'.

The social media site ask.fm which shields the identity of the person asking the questions has previously attracted negative publicity for inciting several teenage girls to commit suicide.

The alias Abu Dujana may refer to a companion of the prophet Mohammed who was renowned as a fearsome warrior and died on the battlefield, or it could be a reference to an Indonesian terrorist serving 15 years for two fatal bombings in Jakarta in 2003 and 2004.
