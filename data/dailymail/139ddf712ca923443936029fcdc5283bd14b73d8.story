An 18-year-old high school student was killed after letting his classmate punch him in the face to settle an alcohol-fueled argument after a party.

Jarom Thomas was leaving a cabin party in Snohomish County, Washington, on Saturday night when he backed his Honda into another car, in which Michael Galen was sat.

Returning minutes later, Thomas argued with Galen about the minor collision before allegedly telling his friend to punch him in the face by way of apology, according to court documents read by KOMO News.

The pair, both students at Crossroads High School in Granite Falls, were seen smoking a cigarette together then shaking hands before Galen dealt the fatal blow - a closed fist to the left side of Thomas's face.

Thomas blacked out immediately, fell backwards, and his head hit the curb. He was pronounced dead hours later in Everett's Providence Colby Hospital.

Galen is being held on a $10,000 bond on suspicion of second-degree manslaughter.

A spokesman for the Granite Falls School District said: 'Our sincerest condolences go to Jarom's family and friends. 

'Please join us in sending the family support and encouragement during this difficult time.'

Galen's father, Mike, tearfully told reporters the pair had been drinking and it 'got out of hand'.

He said: 'I'm really sorry for their family... their loss.

'If I could do something I would. Please, I'm sorry for what my son did. 

'To the parents of the kid that this happened, please, I'm so sorry, he did this, OK? Please, forgive me, and forgive him.'

He added: 'Michael said to me, "Dad, he was my friend, when he got in my face, he told me to hit him because of that." They were all drinking and things got out of hand.' 

'Sorry': Galen's father, Mike, wept as he told reporters that he and his son were sorry for the death

According to court documents, friends carried Thomas into the cabin and tried to revive him after he was hit.

He was murmuring but did not wake up.  

Friends paid tribute to Thomas on his Facebook page, with one writing: 'i can't believe it.. i love you bro and I'll see you soon enough on the other side.'

Another said: 'Still doesn't seem real bro feels like I could pick up the phone and you'd be there you will forever be in my heart brother.'
