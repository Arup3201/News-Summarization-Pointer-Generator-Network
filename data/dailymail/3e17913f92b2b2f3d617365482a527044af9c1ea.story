Raheem Sterling and Liverpool remain 'miles apart' over a new contract, Sportsmail understands.

The in-demand England star, 20, rejected what Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers called an 'incredible' offer, reportedly worth £100,000 week at Anfield.

And Rodgers admitted earlier this month that no agreement would be reached before the end of the season.

Now, a source close to the negotiations revealed that the club and the player's representative remain 'miles apart' as they seek to agree a new, long-term deal.

Sterling, who is expected to play for the Three Lions in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday night, currently has a contract which runs until 2017.

But that is thought to be worth a relatively modest £35,000-a-week - way short of what some of the Premier League's top earners pick up.

Rodgers remains confident that the issue will be resolved and that Sterling, plucked from QPR's academy in 2010, will stay at Liverpool.

However, the pacy, Jamaica-born forward has a number of suitors at home and abroad with the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich monitoring the situation.

A fee of £50m has been mentioned and Manchester City are also thought to be keen as they look to inject youth into an ageing squad but are wary of being used as a bargaining chip.

The source added: 'There is a lot of talk of how staying at Liverpool would be best for Raheem's development, but the kid is a full international who plays for his club in the Premier League every week. It's only right that he explores his options.'

Sterling, who has been struggling with a toe injury, is expected to miss England's friendly in Italy on Tuesday after being granted leave following the Lithuania match by Roy Hodgson.
