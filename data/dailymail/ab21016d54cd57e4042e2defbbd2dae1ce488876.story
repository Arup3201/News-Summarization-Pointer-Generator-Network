The Detroit Piston's hopes for a title may be bleak, but as long as usher Shannon Sailes keeps dancing the fans will have something to smile about.

Sailes, known as the 'Dancing Usher,' is the star of a viral video in which he busts out an impressive set of moves to Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' on the Piston's dance cam.

Sailes manages to keep still for a few moments when the cam pans to him before suddenly breaking into a spot-on impersonation of the King of Pop.

At first, Sailes appears to be a mild-mannered usher ignoring the camera

But suddenly he breaks out in a perfect imitation of Michael Jackson's dance moves

Sailes taught himself to dance, and was entertaining people at family parties at the age of five

It's all the more entertaining because until Sailes begins to dance, he appears to be a by-the book low key usher simply directing people around the arena, and that he's actually ignoring the dance cam out of professionalism.

He told reporters that as soon as he's finished dancing, he crosses his arms to let the dance cam operators know he has to get back to work.

He's long been known as an unofficial Piston's mascot.Â

Sailes only goes through a short routine because he says he still 'has to work'

Sailes delights the crowd even as the team's hopes for a championship fade

'They put the (big-screen) camera on me one day, and I just...did what I did, you know?' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'I started dancing, and it was great. The crowd responded real well. So after that, I just said, if they put the camera on me, I'm gonna keep dancin'. And that's what I've done.'

He says he's a self-taught dancer who started doing moves at family parties when he was only 5.

Now with this recording of his March 8th performance, the secret is out.

Sailes runs through a variety of acrobatic moves in little more than a minute
