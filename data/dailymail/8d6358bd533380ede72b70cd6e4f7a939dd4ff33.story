Football fans have always found cutting ways to mock the tastes and foibles of their rivals, usually through clever songs and chants.

But how much do they actually know about those who stand on the other side of the fence? What do they buy? What do they watch and listen to? How do they vote? What makes them tick?

Well, a detailed survey of over 200,000 people by pollsters YouGov could hold the answers.

They have pulled together a searchable database that tells you the favourite food, hobbies, personality, fashion tastes, car preference, Twitter follow list and general favourite things of football fans.

And, it's fair to say, some of the results are pretty illuminating. Here's a cross-section of just some of the clubs featured.

ARSENAL FANS SHOP AT WAITROSE AND JOHN LEWIS... AND STILL LIKE ROBIN VAN PERSIE

Gunners fans like the finer things in life, the survey finds, and enjoy spending their £1,000+ monthly pocket money at upmarket stores like Waitrose and John Lewis.

They're generally well cultured and informed, reading the Economist, playing chess, eating Coq au Vin and having an interest in world affairs, business and finance, and fashion and design.

When on Twitter, they like to keep up to date with former striker Robin van Persie, now at Manchester United, and Gooner Piers Morgan.

The survey revealed that Arsenal fans still follow former striker Robin van Persie on Twitter

MAN UNITED FANS LOVE WATCHING SOAPS... AND CAN BE FUSSY

YouGov found Manchester United fans to be celebrity-obsessed and TV addicts who enjoy watching Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Eastenders.

Amusingly, the survey found that their favourite TV show is live coverage of the Champions League (even though their team isn't in it this season).

Contrary to popular belief, most do come from the north-west. They're dedicated but can sometimes be fussy and demanding, presumably if the team isn't winning.

LIVERPOOL FANS HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOUR... AND LIKE THEIR BEAUTY PRODUCTS

The personality section of the survey revealed Liverpool fans like to use beauty products to keep themselves looking good.

They pride themselves on their wit, are likely to watch the X Factor, read celebrity magazines and love a pan of scouse.

Former Anfield favourite Mark Lawrenson is rated as their favourite personality.

Liverpool fans are funny... but like wearing lots of beauty products 

CHELSEA FANS LIKE WATCHING JEREMY KYLE AND LOVE A BARGAIN

There's some pretty dubious TV  tastes in this survey but Chelsea fans surely top the list with the Jeremy Kyle Show and Peter Andre's 60 Minute Makeover.

They also love their TV talent shows too, with Cheryl Cole, Gary Barlow, Simon Cowell and Tulisa making the celebrities list.

Blues fans also enjoy dancing, own cats, drive Toyotas and hunt down the best deals when out shopping, the survey said.

Chelsea fans like their TV talent shows and the personalities in them, according to the YouGov poll

NEWCASTLE FANS ARE GREAT COMPANY DOWN THE PUB AND ARE PROUD OF THEIR ROOTS 

The Geordies come out pretty favourably in this survey and are good listeners and good company, especially over a few drinks.

They love a pasty from Greggs followed by rice pudding, like a round of golf in their spare time and have dogs as pets.

Newcastle fans like to keep up with the local news - with Look North among their favourite TV shows and the Chronicle bookmarked on their browsers.

Newcastle fans are good company, especially over a pint, but can sometimes by grumpy

MILLWALL FANS ARE CONFRONTATIONAL, RIGHT-WING AND LIKE BOXING (AND BUTTER)

Millwall supporters tend to be pre-judged more than most and the survey does seem to support many of the common preconceptions.

They vote for right-wing parties in the election, like watching boxing, can be confrontational and intolerant, and think the country is going to the dogs.

On the plus side, they have plenty of spare cash and dress in Ralph Lauren. Bizarrely, the favourite brands section features four types of butter.

Millwall fans are profiled as having plenty of spare cash and are generally men under 40

THRIFTY LEEDS UNITED FANS ARE BARMY ABOUT YORKSHIRE

The main thing that comes across from the Leeds United fans surveyed is their love for their county.

They'll support Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire CCC, keep up to date with local news and live up to their reputation for sticking to a strict budget.

Amusingly, the chief traits from the Leeds fans is that they're 'barmy' and 'straight-forward.'

Leeds United fans will also follow their local rugby league and cricket teams, the survey found

CELTIC FANS ARE POLITICALLY-CHARGED, BIG-HEARTED AND PARTIAL TO A BIT OF ROD STEWART

Some very interesting views emerged from the Celtic survey, including 'the world is controlled by a secretive elite,' 'the United States is the greatest single threat to world peace' and 'basically, Marx was right.'

That aside, they consider themselves big-hearted, compassionate and constructive, if occasionally grumpy and fussy.

There will probably be a bit of Rod Stewart, a Celtic fan, on their iPods and they spend plenty of time on Facebook.

The Celtic fans questioned by YouGov threw up some interesting political statements 

RANGERS FANS HAVE GIVEN UP ON EATING HEALTHILY AND ENJOY WATCHING 'HOMES UNDER THE HAMMER'

One of the opinions most commonly expressed by Gers fans is that they don't bother with diets and exercise. This checks out with the selection of Scottish delicacies in the favourite food list.

They'll spend in excess of 50 hours a week watching the TV, with 'Homes Under The Hammer' cropping up twice in the recently watched shows list.

Video games seem to be the principal source of amusement and their favourite fashion label is Ben Sherman.
