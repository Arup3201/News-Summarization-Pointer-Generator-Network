Cage Warriors 74 star Steve McCombe suffered a gruesome injury during his bout against Nathaniel Wood which saw the fighter continue with a broken forearm.

McCombe was caught with a high kick in the early stages of the fight, but managed to keep fighting temporarily before the referee halted the bout after just over two minutes following a verbal submission.

The Irish featherweight can be seems grimacing in pain as he attempts to battle on as a shocked commentator shouts, 'Oh wow, oh wow. That was terrible'.
