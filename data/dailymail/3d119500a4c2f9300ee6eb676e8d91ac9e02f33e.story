Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon's World Cup could be over before it begins after the veteran goalkeeper suffered a twisted ankle in training.

The 36-year-old Juventus keeper is out of Italy's opening game at the 2014 World Cup against England and is a doubt for the Azzurri's second match against Costa Rica.

With Paris Saint-Germain's Salvatore Sirigu set to deputise, Buffon is in a race to be fit to for Italy's final Group D game against Uruguay on June 24.

But Sigiru has also been struggling with a bruised rib – but the 27-year-old promised Prandelli on the morning of the England game that he was fit to play.

Buffon
 gave Italy a scare in training on Friday night after kicking the turf 
while attempting to boot a dead-ball. He twisted the ankle, which is his
 main problem, but also jarred his left leg and aggravated a thigh 
problem

Buffon hobbled off and later tweeted: 'there are many ways to be important, even if you can't be a protagonist on the pitch. ... So go Salvatore.'

The third goalkeeper in the squad is uncapped 21-year-old, Mattia Perin, of Genoa, who was criticised for his performance by the Brazilian media when he conceded three in a practice match against Fluminense last week.

The goalkeeping crisis adds to Prandelli's defensive woes. The Italy boss lost
 his first-choice left-back Mattia di Sciglio, when the AC Milan 
full-back suffered a calf strain in training on Thursday.

It has not forced him home but he will not be fit for the Group D game in Manaus, which means a reshuffle at the back.

It was unclear whether the Italians would settle for switching 
Torino’s Matteo Darmian to the left and bring in Ignazio Abate of AC 
Milan at right-back, or whether he would move Giorgio Chiellini from 
centre-half to left-back and start with Parma’s Gabriel Paletta in the 
middle.

Defensive
 power has always been Italy’s great strength but Prandelli’s team have 
struggled at the back, which has already prompted the manager to push 
Andrea Pirlo forward from his preferred deep midfield role to 
accommodate Daniele de Rossi as a screener, protecting the 
centre-halves. He will be most reluctant to move Chiellini, who has been
 his rock.

Buffon is the country’s most-capped footballer 
of all time, has been first-choice in goal for nearly 15 years and won 
the World Cup in 2006.

Italy’s
 poor display four years ago in South Africa was largely attributed to 
his absence, when he was forced off with a sciatic nerve problem during 
the opening game.

'Pirlo
 and Buffon are our most important players,' said Chiellini. 'They’ve 
got character and they make the whole team play, so we need to take good
 care of them.'

Prandelli did not blame Buffon’s twist on the pitch in Manaus which is not perfect.

Salvatore Sirigu is a more than worthy replacement for Gianluigi Buffon, considering he is Paris St Germain's No 1 keeper.

The 27-year-old has eight caps for the national team and started for Italy in their friendly against Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage last month.

Sirigu recently had some injury problems of his own after bruising his ribs during training in Florence on June 2 but has recovered in time to face England in Manaus.

Sirigu signed for PSG from Palermo in July 2011 for a transfer fee of 3.5 million euros.
