Shocking recordings of lone gunman Aaron Alexis's Navy Yard killing spree have been released by the FBI.

They detail the moments immediately after civilian contractor Alexis had gone on the rampage at the naval headquarters in Washington DC, shooting dead 12 innocent victims and leaving 15 others with severe injuries.

The 34-year-old's murderous spree went on for about 40 minutes on Monday, and was only brought to an end when he was shot dead by police.

Killer: Recordings have been released detailing the police's immediate response to Aaron Alexis's spree

Response: The operator can be heard relaying details of 'multiple people down' on the fourth floor

Emergency: The officer says the suspect has a shotgun and promises an update on the building's location

In the first of the recordings, an officer says: 'We've a report on the fourth floor of a male with a shotgun, multiple shots fired, multiple people down.

'We're still waiting for the okay that the scene has been secured.

'We've acted to shoot him on the fourth floor. I'll get you an update on the building location.

'We've several people down.'

At this point the telephone operator's voice is drowned out by background noise from police and ambulance sirens.

The recording then cuts to a second operator, who says: 'We're on the scene.... now for the shooting.

'Patients are being transported in and out priority one to Hospital Eight.'

The operator's next comment is not clear, although he appears to say the commander needs to be made aware of what is happening.

He adds: 'We've a victim at New Jersey, and like I said, we're in and out of Hospital Eight, priority one.'

Identity: Alexis was named as the gunman after he was killed using his fingerprints

Alexis was identified as the gunman who opened fire inside Building 197, the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command, which buys, builds and maintains ships, submarines and combat systems.

He was working on the base as a a contractor for Hewlett Packard, and FBI investigators have said that he was able to legitimately gain access to the government facility as a result of that job.

His security clearance was reportedly renewed in July.

When he was killed, Alexis had three guns on him: an AR-15 assault style rifle, a shotgun and a handgun. He is believed to have purchased the shotgun last week in northern Virginia.

FBI assistant DC director in charge Valerie Parlave said he was able to access Building 179 legitimately using the ID card he was given for his role as an approved tech contractor.

'He did have a secret clearance. And he did have a CAC (common access card),' said Thomas Hoshko, CEO of subcontracting group The Experts Inc who employed Alexis.

Alexis was a Navy reservist from 2007 to 2011 when he was dismissed as a result of a series of instances of 'misconduct'.

Witnesses described a gunman opening fire from a fourth-floor overlook, aiming down on people in the cafeteria on the main floor.

Others said a gunman fired at them in a third-floor hallway.

All 12 of the people he killed are believed to be civilians, while a DC police officer is among the 15 others Alexis injured.

Weapons: Sharpshooters Small Arms Range sold Alexis a Remington shotgun capable of firing six shells without reloading

After the first shots were heard, calls started streaming into police and officers were on the scene within two to three minutes of those calls.

Navy Yard worker Patricia Ward told said that she had been in the cafeteria when she heard what sounded like 'pop, pop, pop'.

'Everybody just panicked at first,' she said. 'It was just people running, running, running.'When Metropolitan Police officers arrived on the scene, the internal security team had already determined who was firing the shots and directed them towards Alexis.

DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier said that from that point on, there were 'multiple engagements' between police officers and the suspect and their back-and-forth lasted for 40 minutes.

The time span from the first calls being made about the shooter to the time when police arrived and began to engage with him was relatively brief, as Lanier put it at only seven minutes.

Todd Brundidge, an executive assistant with Navy Sea Systems Command, said he and other co-workers encountered a gunman in a long hallway of their building on the third floor. The gunman was wearing all blue, he said.

'He just turned and started firing,' Brundidge said.

Terrie Durham, an executive assistant with the same agency, said she also saw the gunman firing toward her and Brundridge.

'He aimed high and missed,' she said. 'He said nothing. As soon as I realised he was shooting, we just said, "Get out of the building."'

Brundidge and co-worker Durham were in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command on Monday morning when a fire alarm went off, followed by orders to leave the building.
