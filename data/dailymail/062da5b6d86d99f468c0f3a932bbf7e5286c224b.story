The 19-year-old gunman who shot dead two store workers in a Maryland mall before killing himself, timed his attack to start at the same time as the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, police said. 

Darion Aguilar had a fascination with the school shooting and is believed to have waited inside the mall for more than 40 minutes before beginning his January 25 attack.

Police said on Wednesday that the teenager, who had made thousands of internet searches on mass murder, didn't know his victims and acted alone.

Investigators have been scrutinizing the gunman's computers, cell phone and other records since he shot dead Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, in Zumiez skateboarding store, before turning the gun on himself.

The victims both worked in the store. Miss Benlolo was also the mother to a two-year-old son.

Obsession: Darion Aguilar was fascinated by the Columbine attack, police say

Just before the shooting, Aguilar had posted a photo of himself on Tumblr in which he is dressed in a way that resembled what one 
of the Columbine killers wore, Howard County Police Chief William J McMahon said.

'Police have confirmed Aguilar waited inside the mall for over 40 minutes after being dropped off by a cab, and believe he may have been waiting to begin his shooting at the same time that the Columbine massacre started, at 11.14am, according to a police statement.

Aguilar told a doctor in April last year that he was hearing voices, McMahon said. The voices were 'nonviolent and nonspecific,' the police chief added.

The doctor referred him to a psychiatrist, but police could not find that Aguilar ever met with one.

A review of his Internet searches found visits to mental health sites, including ones where people considering suicide seek help.

Aguilar had no criminal record before the shooting. But a search of his computer revealed thousands of searches for mass shootings at schools and malls.

His Tumblr account also featured hundreds of pictures of shootings and other disturbing images, and the teenager had downloaded a game based on the Columbine shooting.

In the months leading up to the attack, Aguilar also visited online suicide chat rooms and looked up mental health issues.

Then, on December 10, the teenager legally bought a single-barrel shotgun that could be broken down into several pieces.

He returned to the same store between December 10 and 24 to buy rounds of ammunition, and also bought ammunition at a Bass Pro store on December 28.

Police say on January 25 he carried the gun into the mall inside his backpack, before piecing it together in the dressing room of the skate store moments before the shooting.

Two homemade explosives were also in the bag, which he left in the dressing room.

Just before he killed his two victims, Aguilar posted a final message on his Tumblr account, alongside a photo of him with the gun.

The message read: 'I had to do this. Today is the day. On previous days I tried this I woke up with anxiety, regret and hope for a better future this day I didnâ€™t, I woke up felt no emotions no empathy no sympathy. I will have freedom or maybe not. I could care less.'

Police have released a timeline of his
 moves on the day of the attack, along with surveillance footage showing
 him buying rounds of ammunition in December, and walking around the 
mall on the day of the killing.

The teenager is seen making his way towards the skateboard store less than 15 minutes before the shooting.

The store had no security cameras fitted, so no footage shows the attack taking place.

A couple of hours after the shooting Aguilar's mother reported him missing. The search for him intensified after police were shown his journal, NBC News reported.

An extract from the journal was released at a press conference on Wednesday. The teenager had said he was anxious and full of hatred.

'You are all pathetic pieces of s*** who deserve to die. Worthless, you are all f****** worthless,' he wrote.

Another line read: 'Everything seems fake. I think I may already be dead.'

Just after the shootings, his mother described her troubled son as 'a gentle, sweet kid' who has never been interested in guns.

'If you were to go in his room you 
would see what a gentle sweet kid he was,' she said, adding that he was a
 vegetarian because he was concerned about animal welfare.

'I
 don't know what happened, I really don't. It's so unusual, you can talk
 to any of his friends and find out what a gentle person he was.

'I
 don't know, he's never had a gun before, never been interested in guns 
or anything like that. I just don't know what happened, I just don't 
know what happened,' the woman, who did not give her name, added.

Police said they chose to release more information about the case on Wednesday in an effort to bring closure for the community.

However,
 'the investigation will continue for an unknown duration due to an 
ongoing analysis of evidence,' according to the police statement
