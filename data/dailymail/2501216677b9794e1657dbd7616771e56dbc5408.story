A five-year-old boy who fell from rocks and was swept out to sea yesterday afternoon was saved by the kiss of life.

The youngster was carried into the waves by a rip current near Whitby Pier in Yorkshire.

But a quick-thinking passer-by threw the boy a life-ring to hold on to. Rescuers battled strong winds to reach the child and brought him to shore, where lifeguards began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage.

After just one breath from a rescuer, he was able to start breathing again on his own.

An air ambulance flew the boy to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

A Yorkshire Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: ‘It was a panicky situation.’

Lifeguard Christie Milner said: ‘Thanks to the swift actions of the lifeguards and members of the public, the boy was quickly pulled from the water.

‘It is very unusual for anyone who isn’t breathing to start breathing again on their own after just one rescue breath.

‘It’s a fantastic result. We all wish him a speedy recovery.’
