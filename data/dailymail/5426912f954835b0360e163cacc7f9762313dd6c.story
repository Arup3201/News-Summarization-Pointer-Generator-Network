Burnley vs Manchester City (Turf Moor)

Team news

Burnley

Neither Matt Taylor nor new signing Fredrik Ulvestad will be in the Burnley squad for Saturday's Premier League clash with Manchester City at Turf Moor.

Taylor has played twice for the development squad as he continues his slow recovery from Achilles surgery but is not yet ready for the first-team squad.

Norwegian midfielder Ulvestad, meanwhile, is seen more as a player for the long term after signing a three-year deal this week. Dean Marney and Kevin Long (both cruciate) are long-term absentees.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Gilks, Trippier, Mee, Keane, Shackell, Duff, Arfield, Boyd, Jones, Wallace, Kightly, Barnes, Vokes, Ings, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Ward.

Manchester City  

Captain Vincent Kompany will hope to be recalled for the champions' Barclays Premier League visit to Burnley on Saturday.

Belgium defender Kompany was dropped for City's last game against Leicester after a spell of indifferent form, while midfielders Fernandinho and Samir Nasri also missed out.

Striker Wilfried Bony will hope to retain his spot after a first start for the club in the victory over the Foxes. City manager Manuel Pellegrini has reported a fully-fit squad.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Demichelis, Mangala, Kompany, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Nasri, Silva, Milner, Navas, Toure, Fernando, Fernandinho, Lampard, Aguero, Jovetic, Bony, Dzeko.
