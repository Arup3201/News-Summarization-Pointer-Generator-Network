An American company has created a wristband that uses a form of shock therapy to encourage the development of good habits. 

It is called Pavlok. 

The product is branded as a 'personal coach on your wrist' and can even be used to help stop overeating. 

Pavlok is worn as a wristband and can be activated manually or automatically, according to The Telegraph. The idea behind the shocking invention is that the two milliampere shock will condition wearers to develop and stick to good habits by associating the bad habits with the uncomfortable yet effective shock.

Sound familiar?

Pavlok creator Maneesh Sethi was inspired to create the rubber wristband by Pavlov's famous classical conditioning experiment where dogs were trained to expect food each time they heard a bell ring, according to The Daily Dot. 

'By adding a shock while you eat, you train your lizard brain to associate the act of eating (or the type of food) with the shock—and it can effectively limit the drive for mindless eating that you normally have,' Sethi told The Dot. 

Behavior: The band locks together on the wrist, allowing it to give a small shock to the wearer to 'reinforce' their behavior

Journalist EJ Dickson of The Dot put the wristband to the test during the year's most gluttonous of holidays: Thanksgiving. 

Dickson strapped on the wristband before Thanksgiving dinner and, though Sethi reportedly assured Dickson the shock was not painful, the journalist begged to differ.

'It felt like someone was plucking out my arm hair with a pair of pincers,' Dickson wrote.

Dickson wrote of the shock 'It makes you ask yourself, wait, why am I hungry again?' 

Dickson did not overeat that Thanksgiving day, according to The Dot, but the journalist was not sure if that was a result of the Pavlok. However, Dickson wrote that the Pavlok may undoubtedly work as a back-up plan to sheer willpower. 

Dickson remains wary of shock therapy, according to The Dot, but admitted that the wristband was at least somewhat effective because 'I was more than able to button each button of my pants.'   

The Telegraph reports that the wristband is expected to go on sale next year for $244. 

According to the Pavlok website, the wristband helps to transform wearers and promotes change.

'I like to say that for the last 1,000 years, we’ve tamed environment, but we haven’t tamed ourselves, Sethi said. The wristband acts as a helping agent in the 'taming.' 

'...change isn't impossible,' the website states. 'Choose your daily action, and Pavlok will hold you accountable, ensuring lasting success.'

'It's not about the shock as much as it is about training your brain to do the things you say you're going to do,' Sethi told Boston.com.

Negative reinforcement 'really does make people pay attention,' he said.

Hack: A self-proclaimed 'digital nomad,' Sethi's most recent endeavor is his 'Hack the System' campaign, which features numerous posts including exercise, travel, productivity, and money-making hacks.

According to website,'Pavlok offers a simple, wearable device that helps consumers form better habits.

'Using psychologically proven and user tested algorithms, the Pavlok wristband enforces users’ commitments to fitness, productivity, and more — even if that means 'sparking' their commitment by delivering a mild (but jolting) electric shock.'

Although the firm hasn't revealed exactly how it works, it say 'Pavlok combines accurate tracking capabilities, powerful commitment techniques, and ‘on-your-wrist’ reminder triggers to change users’ brains and form the habits they wish they had.

'Through our proprietary negative and positive reinforcement technique, Pavlok doesn’t simply nudge someone to change their behavior - it pushes them to transform themselves and form the habit to maintain their transformation.'

In 2012, Sethi hit the headlines when he advertised on Craigslist for someone to slap him if he became distracted.

I figured, 'This is stupid, why am I wasting this time doing nothing? When I have a boss, or someone of authority watching me, I always get my work done. How can I simulate the authority figure?

'Naturally, I believe that an authority figure should have real authority.

'And I am a big fan of Slap Bets. Put those together — and I realized I needed someone to make me work, with permission to slap me in the whenever I cheated.'

A self-proclaimed 'digital nomad,' Sethi's most recent endeavor is his 'Hack the System' campaign. The 'Hack the System' website features numerous blog posts Sethi believes will help its readers to 'bypass' the 'system.'

The site includes posts such as 'How to Launch a Dropshippig business in a day,' '5 Hacks to Learning German in 3 Months,' 'How to Travel the World Without Working,' and others, the site features hacks on topics ranging from exercise to travel.
