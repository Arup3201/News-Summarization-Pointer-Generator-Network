West Brom have never won a Premier League game away from home in August. 

Ronald Koeman has backed Southampton keeper Fraser Forster to challenge Joe Hart for England’s No 1 spot.

Forster, a £10million signing from Celtic, was on top form to keep out West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

Standing tall: Forster watches an effort from West Brom's Brown Ideye go past his post at St Mary's

Koeman said: ‘We like that he will be No 1 for England, because that is good for him, good for his experience and good for our club.’

Forster was confident coming for crosses and sharp to rush from his line to block West Brom’s Brown Ideye when he ran through on goal. 

Confident: Koeman has shown great belief in the keeper, who cost him £10million from Celtic this summer

On a roll: A string of impressive performances earned Forster an England place for the World Cup
