Killed: Jordan Brennan, 17, pictured, suffered a fatal blow to the head during a scuffle with a 16-year-old boy at a corner shop in Manchester in October

A boy who attacked and killed a teenager after interpreting his Gangnam-Style dance as 'racist' has been jailed for eight months.

Jordan Brennan, 17, had broken into the dance made famous by South Korean artist Psy  at a corner shop in Gorton, Manchester.

But it enraged the other boy, 16, who was shopping in the same store and thought his South East Asian ethnicity was being mocked.

After claiming Jordan bumped into him as he spun round, the 16-year old attacker, who was with his girlfriend, tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle.

As they struggled near the doorway, Jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below. 

The attacker then kicked him in the legs before returned to his shopping.

College student Jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up. 

He was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when his mother Kim tried to raise him for breakfast.

Tests showed he had suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain. 

At Manchester Crown Court on Friday, the killer, now 17, was jailed for eight months. 

The teen, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had earlier admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted.

The tragedy occurred at around 7.30pm on Friday October 10 when Jordan who attended Manchester College and described as 'polite, very bubbly, happy-go-lucky type of lad' was with two friends. 

They went into the N.A Grocer shop on an errand but inside he began doing the Gangnam style dance and within 17 seconds there was a 'flashpoint' between him and the other teenager.

Discussing the tragedy at NA Grocers, Mr Hall said CCTV in the shop captured Jordan 'dancing' in the shop before an argument took place.

Weeping was audible from a public gallery packed full of Jordan's family and friends throughout prosecutor Rob Hall's opening address.

He said: 'In a relatively short period of time, the defendant is in the queue at the checkout, Jordan is waiting around while others are in the check out queue and while he is waiting he proceeds to dance.

'That dance was accompanied by a reference to the well-known song Gangnam Style.

'It appears that this defendant perceived that dancing and reference as being a racist slur upon him. Jordan is of good character and so to that extent there is nothing to suggest he had racist intentions in any way.

'Needless to say that raised the defendant and he began to remonstrate about what happened. As they went to the exit door the two came into physical contact with the defendant raising his hands and pushing and pulling and in effect the physical contact put Jordan to the ground outside the exit and regrettably the back of his head made heavy contact with paving slabs outside.

'Within a relatively short period of time the incident ended. The defendant was outside for 18 seconds. The whole thing lasted less than 18 seconds. 

'The defendant returned back to the store to pay for his shopping and was only absent from the queue for 24 seconds which reflects how fleeting this incident was.'

The court was told that the defendant, a straight-A student, had no idea he had caused any injury until he saw coverage of Jordan's death in newspapers and on TV.

Jordan returned to his home which was just minutes from the shop and told his mother he was feeling unwell, it was said.

Tragically, his mother became so concerned upon his appearance and knowledge of the incident that she suggested they call an ambulance, but Jordan did not want to go to hospital.

Mr Hall added: 'Jordan, being as he was, said even if his mother called an ambulance he would send it away. It is regrettable he in effect was not medically examined at the time. 

'He had been sick at about midnight and again Jordan was asserting he was fine and wanted to be left alone. It is with much regret and feelings of guilt that she did not do more.'

Jordan was checked on by his mother at 3.30am at which point he was sound asleep but when the family rose for the day at around 9am he was unresponsive in bed.

 Paramedics arrived just six minutes later but it was clear he had been dead for some time.

The impact of his head hitting the pavement following the attack fractured his skull and caused bleeding on the brain. Had he been treated in hospital, he could have survived his injuries, it was said.

In mitigation, Kate Blackwell QC said: 'This is a case which has led to a tragic outcome for two families. The death of Jordan was in any view devastating for his family. 

'It doesn't take much to imagine for those of us who haven't lost any young family member to understand the pain and wretched loss that prevails when this happens. This case has in other ways been a terrible ordeal for the defendant and his family.'

The court heard the teenager moved to the UK at the age of nine, from his native Mongolia, and excelled in his studies, receiving exemplary references from his teachers and peers which were put forward at court.

She added: 'He is polite, respectful, bright, kind, with an impeccable manner. He loved school and the whole experience was grabbed by both hands.

'This was a chance encounter and his reaction to that situation was not thought by anyone to be serious and there was certainly no intention to cause serious harm and none was expected to be caused.'

Sentencing him to eight months in youth custody, Judge David Stockdale said: 'Your assault on him was quite inexcusable. Your mood of aggression was demonstrated first by your pursuit of him out of the shop and by subsequently kicking him after he fell.

'You had everything going for you. But so did Jordan Brennan. A boy of 17, happy, healthy, a young boy of good character, he too had everything going for him.

'This case serves as a reminder if a reminder was necessary of the lethal consequences, unforeseeable consequences, that so often follow as a result of what might be described as low-level violence.

'Despite all of the mitigating factors I have heard and read and taken into account, I reach the conclusion that the sentence of this court must be custodial.'

In a statement Jordan's mother said: 'Our son Jordan Brennan was 17 years old and was a well liked young man. He was a loveable rogue and was always polite and keen to help anyone who needed his help, be that physical help or just to listen to a friend.

'He would cheer them up with his usual larking about or joking around. He was a pleasure to have as a son and his loss is devastating. He was greatly loved by all that knew him.'
