Alfredo Sanchez has been found living in Sydney after reportedly faking his own death to receive £1.25m in life insurance

A man said to have faked his own death in Britain for a £1.25million life insurance payout has been found living in Australia.

Alfredo Sanchez was tracked down to Sydney after months of speculation that he was somewhere in the country with his four children.

Sanchez, 47, whose fingerprints were found on his own death certificate, had been surviving on takeaway chicken and chips under the alias of Hugo Sanchez.

His 44-year-old wife Sophie is serving
a two-year jail term in Britain for her role in the fraud for which her
husband is wanted.

Police in Australia were last night reported to be liaising with their British counterparts.

When challenged about the alleged 
fraud, Sanchez said he was aware of reports in the UK claiming that he 
and his wife had defrauded an insurance company, but he issued a denial.

‘I know, I know (about the article),’ 
he said, adding ‘not true’. He insisted his wife was not serving a jail 
sentence but was in England ‘visiting family’ and would be back in 
Australia next year.

‘Sophie is not in jail, she is with family, that’s all,’ he declared.

Ecuador-born Sanchez shrugged when 
asked how he could have the same surname as the wanted man, look the 
same, share the same date of birth and have a wife with the same name, 
yet deny he was the fugitive.

‘Excuse me, I am innocent until proven guilty,’ he said. ‘I have not done anything. If they want me, they can come and get me.’

Sanchez and his wife, who had been 
living in Farnham, Surrey, had run into debt and he allegedly persuaded 
his wife to tell his employers at HMV that he had died while abroad.

Jailed: Sophie Sanchez is currently serving two years for her role in fraud. She was caught after flying home for her sister's wedding last year

She told the authorities that he had been cremated.

The couple are thought to have moved 
to Australia with their  children soon after receiving a life insurance 
lump sum payout in 2005. But when someone continued to  use the ‘dead 
man’s’ HMV staff discount card, authorities became suspicious.

Evidence built up against Sanchez in the UK when detectives found his fingerprints on his death certificate.

Mrs Sanchez was arrested in September last year when she flew to the UK from Australia for her sister’s wedding.

She told police that her husband was indeed alive.

Prosecutors said the fraud was ‘not very professional’ but had been ‘planned and carried out over a period of time’.

A court heard that Mrs Sanchez was 
‘genuinely very remorseful’ for what had happened and that she had not 
tried to sidestep responsibility for her actions which had been 
motivated by the amount of debt her husband had accrued.

Mrs Sanchez admitted six offences of fraud but denied seven others which will lie on file.

Until several weeks ago her husband 
owned a tattoo parlour in Sydney, but he had to shut for good after the 
business was firebombed for a second time.
