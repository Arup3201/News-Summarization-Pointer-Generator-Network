A couple who allegedly kept two frozen alligators, an illegal fish and bags of meth in the Florida home they shared with their 10-month-old twin daughters have been arrested.

Shane William Park, 29, and Cortney Loraine Williams, 24, were busted after a search at their Lake Wales house on Tuesday also turned up a marijuana plant and drug paraphernalia, police said.

A third adult, 31-year-old Joshua Lee Mellon, who was at the couple's home when deputies executed a search warrant, was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia.

Bizarre: The couple had stashed two alligators in their freezer that they intended to stuff, they said

Illegal: They admitted they did not have permits for the animals, which they said were given by a relative

During the search, deputies allegedly 
found two alligators in a freezer that Williams said Park's cousin had 
given her a year ago to stuff. The couple did not have a permit for the 
animals.

Then in an aquarium
 in the living room, the deputies also allegedly found a living black 
bass, which was undersize by the standards of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. They seized the fish.

During the search, authorities found a total of 278 grams of methamphetamine throughout the house stashed in bags, boxes and in liquid form in drinking bottles, the affidavit said.

In an office room, the Polk County Sheriff's Office deputies found a glass pipe and foil, which both tested positive for meth residue.

Danger: The couple allegedly kept meth in the home they shared with their 10-month-old twins

Removed: They pose with their daughters, who have now been taken into custody of child protective services

A Mountain
 Dew bottle and a Powerade bottle had both been fashioned into smoking 
devices and filled with liquid meth, according to the affidavit.

Meth
 residue was also allegedly found on a pipe stashed in a chest in the 
living room. In the master bedroom - where Williams was found sleeping -
 there was allegedly a bag of meth on the floor.

'Some items were in plain view and easy reach of children,' the affidavit said.

Park admitted that he had been selling the meth but said he was worried to stop, in case it affected his family.

Williams
 agreed the meth was her boyfriend's - although she was not sure if he 
was using it or just selling it. She insisted that he did not use it in 
the house in front of the babies.

Seized: They also had a black bass that was a non-permitted size, so it was seized by the Wildlife Commission

Stash: A scale and bag of meth were found in a bedroom - but Williams said it was not used in front of the kids

Evidence: In total, 278 grams of methamphetamine were allgedly found and removed from the house

Park and Williams were taken to Polk County Jail, where they remain without bail. Their daughters were taken into the custody of the Department of Children and Families.

The couple each face charges including two counts of killing or possessing an 
alligator, two counts of negligent child abuse without bodily harm and 
armed trafficking in methamphetamine.

The couple's Facebook pages show 
images of them doting over the little girls, who were born last April. 
Williams works for orange juice company Florida's Natural Growers, 
according to her page.

Mellon was also taken to the jail but released on Wednesday on $1,500 bail.
