'A gentleman': Aamir Siddiqi was knifed to death

Two blundering hitmen killed an A-level student with ‘indescribable savagery’ when they went to his suburban home by mistake, a court heard yesterday.

Ben Hope, 38, and Jason Richards, 37, had been paid ‘a pittance’ to kill a father-of-four after a property deal went sour, it was alleged.

But showing staggering incompetence they entered a semi-detached home 100 yards away from their intended target, where they stabbed to death sixth former Aamir Siddiqi, 17, jurors heard.

Aamir’s retired parents tried to fight off the masked assassins – but were stabbed by Hope and Richards, who howled during the attack to intimidate them, it is claimed. 

The killers, who are both heroin addicts, then went on a shopping spree with the money they received for the killing, with Hope spending £700 on a laptop in PC World and £100 on training shoes in JD Sports, jurors heard. 

The alleged crime boss who ordered the killing – Dubai-born Mohammed Ali Ege, 32 – is on the run, the court was told.

Aamir, who was studying at a £9,000-a-year private school and had hoped to read law at Cardiff University, was described by his parents as a ‘young gentleman’. 

Patrick Harrington QC, prosecuting, told Cardiff Crown Court: ‘On a sunny Sunday afternoon, this young man was stabbed to death in the hallway of his home.

‘Neither he nor his parents had any expectation that their lives would be shattered by that attack that day.’

Mr Harrington said that the two men, allegedly recruited by Ege ‘over a debt’, were ‘disorientated possibly because of drugs’.

‘With what can only be described as staggering incompetence, they went to wholly the wrong address and killed an innocent young man who was waiting for his Koran teacher,’ he said.

Aamir was stabbed in the neck on the doorstep of his five-bedroom, semi-detached home in Ninian Road in the leafy Roath Park suburb of Cardiff on April 11 last year.

But their intended victim was a father-of-four living less than 100 yards away – in a terraced house in neighbouring Shirley Road, the court heard.

Aamir’s father Iqbal, 68, a retired civil servant and mother Parveen, 55, a retired education official, were injured trying to help their son.

Mr Harrington said: ‘While the emergency services attempted to revive Aamir, the defendants went off in pursuit of their blood money. 

‘It’s a chilling thought that in this city there are two men who murdered for the price of a pair of training shoes and a laptop computer.’

Mr Harrington added: ‘These two men used lethal weapons against a totally defenceless teenage boy and his parents for a pittance.

‘This was a crime of indescribable brutality and savagery which they are now trying to avoid the consequences of by blaming each other.’ The court heard Richards blamed the killing on Hope and a ‘man from Sheffield’.

And Hope claims he had been in the 
company of Richards at times during the day, but that during the 
afternoon he had fallen asleep after taking heroin, Mr Harrington said.

He added: ‘They seem to be agreed about one thing – that the killer is in the dock.’

He told the jury: ‘These are the two men who went to the home of Aamir Siddiqi and carried out their lethal contract.’

The court heard Ege would often deal in large sums of cash.

Mr Harrington said Ege had ordered the killing after the alleged target was unable to return a £50,000 cash deposit when Ege changed his mind over deal to buy a house from him. The defendants, both of Cardiff, deny murdering Aamir.
