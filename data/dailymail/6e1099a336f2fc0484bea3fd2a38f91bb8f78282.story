British mobile phone customers on Three can now call home and use the internet when holidaying in the U.S for no extra cost.

America is one of four new countries the mobile operator has added to its Feel at Home roaming scheme that launched in August.

Travellers heading to Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Macau can also now use their call plan in the same way they would at home, without paying a premium, and this takes the total number of locations on the scheme up to 11.

Three has begun rolling out its 4G network.

Select customers with 4G-ready devices can now use 
the service when in an area with 4G coverage.

This rollout will continue to other customers throughout
January, and all customers with a compatible device should be able to access 4G by the end of March.

Three aims to cover 50 cities with 4G by the end of 2014 and 98 per cent of the population by the end of 2015.

Other countries that were already covered by the scheme include Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong 
Kong, Sweden and Denmark.

The service will automatically activate as soon as the phone enters any of these countries and picks up a local network.

It is hoped the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences.

The Government plans to scrap roaming charges in the EU by 2016, although no set plans are in place for when exactly this will happen.

This will of course mean holidaymakers travelling outside of this jurisdiction will still face high bills, though.

Three's Feel at Home scheme is now available in eleven countries and it is hoped the move could lead to the scrapping of international roaming charges elsewhere. Holidaymakers in Ireland, Australia, Italy (Rome's Colosseum is pictured left) Hong Kong, Sweden (right) and Denmark can also use the service from today

Three describes the scheme as ‘a new, simple and affordable way to stay in touch with friends and family back home while travelling overseas’.

Customers with pay monthly contracts, pay-as-you-go and SIM-only packages, mobile broadband and business plans can use the service.

However, customers who exceed their minutes or data allowance included in their price plan while abroad in any one of the seven countries will be subject to reduced roaming rates.

People who make a call to a non-UK number will still be charged at the full roaming rate and tethering is not allowed under the scheme.

Commenting on the news, Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'For too long, despite worldwide caps being in place and networks offering special packages to help keep a lid on roaming costs, holidaying Brits have faced coming home to the souvenir from hell - an eye-watering phone bill.

'It was great to see Three take the initiative when Feel at Home launched in August and It is the addition of the U.S. that now makes this plan really stand out.'
