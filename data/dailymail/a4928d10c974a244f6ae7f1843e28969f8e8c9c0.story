A mum who ballooned to a size 26 with a steady diet of fast food and crisps is launching her modelling career after shedding six stone in just five months.

Mallorie Goodwin, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, topped out at 15st as she struggled to control her weight and poor eating habits for much of her life, but has shifted the bulge after committing to a rigid diet.

Now a healthy 9st 5lb, the 39-year-old 'yummy mummy' has the size eight body she has always dreamed of and has even been contacted by a modelling agency.

The svelte mum-of-two said: 'It's a dream come true. I have now got the figure I always wanted and I feel so much more confident in myself - to have a modelling agency want me is just the cherry on top.

'Now when I go out with my husband Anthony people think I'm his daughter. I'm so happy to have a figure I always wanted - I'm just getting used to it.

'I have a wardrobe bursting with clothes and I can't wait to show my outfits off. Before I hated my picture taken but now I love it.'

Her weight problems began as a child when she was served huge portions of hearty meals such as cottage pie.

At the age of six, her parents would exclude her from fish and chips dinners because she was overweight.

Mallorie said: 'I was always conscious that my weight was a problem from a very young age.

'We would eat very large portions at home and I grew up in the era when you would finish everything on your plate.

'My mother was told by my primary school teacher that I was always asking for seconds.'

She shed the puppy fat in secondary school but with access to junk food like pizza and crisps as she grew older, the weight soon came back.

'I knew I was getting bigger and I had a double chin which I hated. I would very rarely have my picture taken.'

She was able to munch through 15 bags of crisps in an evening and kept piling on the weight – and losing confidence – as she grew older.

Things took a turn for the worse when, in her 20s, she was a size 14 and her boyfriend at the time told her he always dated slimmer girls who were a size eight.

Mallorie said: 'My confidence was non-existent. I knew I should have been a size ten but I was living a party lifestyle, going out drinking and having curries at 1am.

'I would then wake up and have a full fry up and pick on junk food throughout the day.'

Later, after Mallorie had her two children, Dylan, 9, and Pippa, 7, she struggled with health issues, including fatigue and back pain.

After going back and forth to doctors' appointments for five years, she was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid.

It was at the doctors that she finally weighed herself and realised the scales were reading 15st.

It served as a wake-up call and she prepared herself for the fight of life.

Mallorie said: 'I was gobsmacked. I had accepted that I was about 13 stone but to see 15 was a complete shock. 

Breakfast: Fry up

Lunch: Two Big Mac meals from McDonald's

Snacks: Crisps

Dinner: Pizza, Chinese, curry, roast dinners or cottage pie

Breakfast: CWP shake, poached eggs, or porridge with skimmed milk

Lunch: CWP soup 

Dinner: Chicken and veg, fish and veg

Snacks: CWP, lemon bar, nuts, fruit, yoghurt

'I had a battle with my health and not feeling well since I had my children and to finally find out what was wrong gave me the confidence to lose the weight.

'Once I started my medication and my health improved I realised I was left with this fat body which I didn't want.

'The doctor told me that if I didn't lose weight I was at risk of developing diabetes - it was a real wake-up call.'

Mallorie started the Cambridge Weight Plan in November of last year and lost a staggering five stone 10lb in just five months.

She said: 'I cut out the junk and lost seven pounds on my own but it wasn't enough. Cambridge Weight Plan was perfect for me - after two weeks on the soups and shakes I didn't feel hungry at all and the support I received was amazing.'

Mallorie even sent in her picture to a modelling agency after being encouraged by a stylist on a Cambridge Weight Plan shoot.

She was stunned when the agency said they wanted to represent her.

She said: 'I'm so excited about the thought of modelling. When I was a size 26 I never dreamed I would be happy having my photo taken - now I can't wait to get in front of the camera and try my hand at modelling.

'I have been on photo shoots for Cambridge Weight Plan and on one the stylist said to me that as I should look into doing modelling because she thought I would be really good.

'Never in a million years did I dream I would be starting a modelling career at 39.

'I'm so excited, my husband was a bit worried but I've told him I'm not going to go off with anyone else.'

Mallorie has become a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant, using her experience of being overweight to help others.

'I've been there so I know how hard it is and how lonely it can feel.

'I get a lot of compliments from other mums or women asking to help them, which I can't wait to do.

'My life has changed for the better and my husband and children are so proud of me and love how happy and content I am and now I just want to give something back.'
