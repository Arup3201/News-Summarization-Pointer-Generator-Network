Extra funds: George Osborne is expected to plough another £10billion into the International Monetary Fund on top of the agreed £29.5bn

George Osborne is expected to plough another £10billion into the International Monetary Fund to help increase its resources, it emerged today.

The UK has already pledged £29.5bn to the Fund, £5.5bn of which has gone into the eurozone rescue scheme.

But it is thought the Chancellor will agree to add more money to help the IMF go from $400bn (£250bn) to around $1trillion.

The Government is able to commit the extra £10bn without a vote in Parliament but Mr Osborne said the UK will only dish out the extra cash if there were 'no new vehicles or funds 
specific to the eurozone'.

He also said there would be no deal unless all major non-eurozone countries signed up to give more.

All bar the U.S. after Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, said the U.S. would not pledge any more money until the eurozone added sufficient funds to its bail-out scheme.

It was a blow to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde who told The Telegraph last week that she was 'hopeful we will make progress' this week.

She hinted that the increase would be smaller than first thought as the 'needs now may not be quite a large.'

Ms Lagarde will now try to persuade the other major 
non-eurozone members: the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, China and 
India to pledge funds.

So far China and Japan have indicated they would be willing to broker a deal.

The eurozone has increased its rescue funds by about £247bn since February despite Mexico's G20 summit ending without a deal being struck.

The IMF has already secured €150bn from the 17-member eurozone on top of its own €800bn bail-out fund.
