Australian
 Olympic swimming legend Ian Thorpe is set to reveal that he is gay in 
an interview with Sir Michael Parkinson after years of denials and 
speculation about his sexuality.

The Sunday Telegraph
 reports that Thorpe, who retired from professional swimming in 2012, 
will make the full admission during a sit-down, tell-all interview with 
the British TV personality set to air Sunday night on Australia's Ten 
Network.

In
 the lead-up to the highly anticipated interview, a teaser released by 
the network showed Thorpe being posed the question that has plagued him 
his entire career - is he, or isn't he, gay?

'Are you gay?' No question was off-limits for British journalist Michael Parkinson when he sat down with former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe for an interview that went to air Sunday night.

Thorpie's revealing interview has been overshadowed by reports of a lucrative deal

In the 25-second clip, Parkinson said to Thorpe: 'You've always said that you're not gay... is all of that true?'

The
 scene then cuts to an uncomfortable looking Thorpe, 31, who appears to 
be nervously finding his words, before confirming his sexuality.

Parkinson,
 79, said: 'I think his sexuality is no one's business but his own. But I
 think it is one of the best interviews I have ever done.'

The revelation sent Twitter into a frenzy with mostly tweets of support for the gold-medallist.

'Ian
 Thorpe we're proud of YOU Regardless of sexuality, achievements, medals
 or anything else... You're an Aussie who we'll love & stand by,' 
@2dayFMbreakfast wrote.

'Big
 love to @IanThorpe!' tweeted @GayTimesMag, while Lady Catherine 
‏@KadyLio wrote: 'I can only hope Thorpe's revelations help millions of 
teens struggling inside themselves to find the courage to be them. Snaps
 for Thorpie.'

Anthony Venn-Brown @gayambassador tweeted: 'Life's much brighter on this side of the closet @IanThorpe. Welcome to being you.'

Supportive: Twitter was sent into a frenzy following Thorpe's news

Twitter follows showed their support for the Olympic swimmer

Words of encouragement were also tweeted for Ian Thorpe

In
 his 2012 autobiography This Is Me, Australia's most decorated Olympian 
said that he found the accusations about his sexuality hurtful and 
judging of his integrity.

In
 an extract, he explained: 'That’s the only part I find hurtful, that 
this is something I would be embarrassed about and that I would hide.'

'For the record, I am not gay and all my sexual experiences have been straight,' he added.

'I'm attracted to women, I love children and aspire to have a family one day.

'I
 know what it's like to grow up and be told what your sexuality is, then
 realising that it's not the full reality. I was accused of being gay 
before I knew who I was.'

This
 followed years of public denials including a statement issued in 2009 
by his management company: 'In the past, on several separate occasions, I
 have answered questions about my sexuality openly and honestly with the
 media ... my situation in this regard has not changed,' he said.

Then
 in July 2011 he told the The Sunday Times : 'I don't think anybody has a
 right to write about [my private life], but I don't care enough about 
it to be bothered. If you try and fight it, you're damned; if you don't,
 you're damned. If you get married, it's a sham.'

The startling admission is just taste of what viewers can expect from the no-holds barred interview.

False
 claim: In 2009 it was reported that Thorpe's management issued a 
statement regarding comments in a 2007 magazine article discussing a 
heterosexual relationship with Olympic swimmer Amanda Beard

In 2009, news.com.au
 reported that Thorpe's management issued a statement regarding comments
 in a 2007 magazine article discussing a heterosexual relationship with 
Olympic swimmer Amanda Beard.

'Well,
 I did have a long-term, long-distance relationship (with Beard), and it
 was great while it lasted. It was sort of public knowledge we were 
seeing each other, and yet not. It went on for ages, years,' he was 
quoted as saying.

Beard's 
agent quashed the statement: 'Take out the word relationship and put in 
the word friendship and that's exactly what it was.'

Thorpe,
 who will be part of Network Ten's Commonwealth Games commentary team 
this month, has just overcome a physical and mental battle following 
complications arising from shoulder surgery that almost cost him his 
arm.

More to come: In the 25 second promo clip, Parkinson said to Thorpe: 'You've always said that you're not gay... is all of that true?'

Sit down chat: 'His fight against depression offers a unique insight into the darker side of celebrity and success,' Michael said

No holds barred: Ian looked pained as Parkinson quizzed him on his sexuality

Parkinson
 said Thorpe's decision that no question was off limits was brave and 
says he examines the good times and the bad of the Australian swimming 
legend.

'His
 fight against depression offers a unique insight into the darker side 
of celebrity and success,' Parkinson said in a statement released by 
Ten.

'What
 fascinates me most about Ian is that apart from the very beginning of 
his career, he never seemed to enjoy and celebrate his success.

'Ian Thorpe has always been near the top of my list to interview.

'Not many athletes can claim to be the best of all time. Ian can.'

Superhuman! Known as the the Thorpedo during his stellar career, Thorpe smashed 22 world records and along the way won five gold, three silver and one bronze Olympic medals

Parkinson is renowned for not being afraid to ask the tough and sometimes uncomfortable questions.

Some
 of the British journalist's most memorable moments includes the time 
that boxer Muhammad Ali squared up to him for calling him Cassius Clay 
instead of by his Muslim name, and when former Spice Girl Victoria 
Beckham let slip her nickname for husband David was Golden Balls.

Former
 British Primer Minister Tony Blair also spoke about the time that his 
father-in-law had asked permission to smoke cannabis in front of him, 
while his chat with Hollywood A-lister Meg Ryan made for uncomfortable 
viewing when she appeared moody and unresponsive and asked for the 
interview to be wrapped up.

A good get! 'Ian has always been near the top of my list to interview,' Parkinson said

                  
 Known as the the Thorpedo during his stellar career, Thorpe smashed 22 
world records and along the way won five gold, three silver and one 
bronze Olympic medals.

He has also won 11 World titles and 11 (10 gold, one silver) Commonwealth Games medals.

Thorpe
 first retired in November, 2006, aged 24, and then made an ill-fated 
comeback in 2011 when he failed to make the Australian team for the 2012
 London Games.

Ten has announced it will air the TV special, Ian Thorpe: The Parkinson Interview, on Sunday, July 13, at 6.30pm.

Thorpe’s agent and Network Ten have been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment.
