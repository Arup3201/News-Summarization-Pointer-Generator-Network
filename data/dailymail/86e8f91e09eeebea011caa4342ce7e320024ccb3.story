The Roman Catholic archbishop of Cincinnati has criticized the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' movie as 'a direct assault on Christian marriage.'

The new movie is based on the best-selling erotic novel of the same name by E.L. James that includes bondage, dominance and sadomasochism.

'Fifty Shades of Grey' follows the relationship between 27-year-old billionaire and BDSM enthusiast Christian Grey and virginal college student Anastasia Steele.

Archbishop Dennis Schnurr said in a message to priests and on the archdiocese's Facebook page that the movie is in 'direct contrast to the Christian message' about marriage and sexual intimacy.

His statement urges informing people about 'the destructive message' of the movie and highlighting 'the beauty of God's design for loving relationships between a husband and wife in the bond of marriage.'

In full, the Facebook post read 'From Archbishop Schnurr: The movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, is scheduled to debut in theaters across America on February 13, 2015. The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable.'

It continued 'In the story line, a young Miss Steele is urged to sign a contract becoming a sex slave and agreeing to an abusive and degrading relationship. This movie is in direct contrast to the Christian message of God’s design for self-giving and self-sacrificing love, marriage and sexual intimacy.'

'The movie is a direct assault on Christian marriage and on the moral and spiritual strength of God’s people,' the statement went on. 'We need to inform our people about the destructive message of this movie and to highlight the beauty of God’s design for loving relationships between a husband and wife in the bond of marriage.'

According to the Cincinatti Enquirer, Schurr's letter to priests was from February 4.

The newspaper reported that the Facebook page for the archdiocese previously had a photo up with the words 'Boycott Fifty Shades of Grey' - and beneath that line were the words 'Ditch the film, and give instead to a domestic violence shelter.'

A staffer mistakenly uploaded the photograph, archdiocese spokesman Dan Andriacco told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

'I'm sure the archbishop would not think it's a bad idea, but it's not his idea,' Andriacco told the newspaper. 'This is not something the archbishop specifically has asked for.'

The Cincinnati Archdiocese comprises 19 counties.

In an Associated Press interview published Wednesday, James said of 'Fifty Shades' 'The fact is, it's a love story, and women respond to the love story. The fact that there's a little bit of kinky sex in there is sort of like an added bonus. It's just become sensationalized, because it's like... Oh my God, women like sex. Yes we do, thank you very much!'
