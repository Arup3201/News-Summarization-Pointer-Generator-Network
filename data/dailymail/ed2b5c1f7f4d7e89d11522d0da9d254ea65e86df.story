It sounds a little like something Captain Mainwaring might have dreamed up.

But don’t panic – not all the fires that raged across Britain during Hitler’s bombing onslaught were homes and factories ablaze.

For a cunning plan to build decoy towns and set them alight bamboozled the Luftwaffe into believing they had hit their targets.

Burning: A Starfish basket fire is pictured in an unknown location. The Starfish sites - which got their name from the initials 'SF', standing for 'Special Fire' sites - were intended to simulate burning cities during the Blitz

The so-called Starfish towns, named 
after initials that actually stood for ‘Special Fire’ sites, were 
commissioned to avoid the kind of disaster that destroyed Coventry 
during the Blitz.

The dummy towns were sited miles away 
from communities and cities likely to come under attack. As soon as the 
first wave of German bombers lit up or attacked a real target, emergency
 teams raced to extinguish the flames – then lit the decoy fires.

The aim was to convince the second wave this was the target and to fool them into dropping bombs harmlessly on the decoy site.

The ruse was developed by Colonel John Turner, a respected engineer and retired Air Ministry officer.

But the construction, deployment and 
ignition of the fires may have been more akin to a stroke of Dad’s 
Army-style genius. Tanks containing paraffin or diesel were placed on 
top of 20ft towers, arranged to resemble rows of buildings or industrial
 complexes.

Ready for action: An anonymous Starfish site is pictured. Liverpool, Bristol and Nottingham were protected by the sites - with the German pilots thinking that a Starfish site 14 miles away from the latter was Derby

A valve that operated like a toilet 
flush was opened to release the fuel on to burning coal, creating an 
instant blaze and engulfing the area in black smoke.

Then the fire was flushed with water 
to send a column of steam into the night sky. Result: a rather 
convincing mock-up of a bombing raid that hit its target.

Dummy sites were a key tactic to preserving important transport hubs and cities in Britain during the bombings of World War Two.

There were around 230 dummy airfields in the UK and 400 dummy urban and industrial sites.

Dummy railway marshalling yards and docks also existed in an attempt to trick the Luftwaffe.

By the end of the war there were 237 
Starfish sites protecting 81 cities, factories and other potential 
targets. 

Official figures reveal that 730 bombing raids were diverted 
to these dummy targets.

Among them was one built several miles outside Derby, home of Rolls-Royce aero engine production.

Middlesbrough, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth and Cardiff were some of the other major cities protected.

Starfish towns were among several decoy projects used to dupe the enemy during the Second World War.

Other masterstrokes included building depots of cardboard tanks, or planting landing lights to look like airfields.
