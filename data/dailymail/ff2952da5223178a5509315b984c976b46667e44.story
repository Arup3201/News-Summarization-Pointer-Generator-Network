Henrik Stenson permeated the peaceful surroundings at Hoylake by snapping his club.

The Swede found rough on the left with his tee shot on the 17th, and failed to escape with his second shot.

He then snapped his four iron into two pieces on his knee before calmly handing the remnants to his caddy.

Stenson - playing with Tiger Woods - ended the hole with a bogey, taking him to one over for the round.

Snapped: Stenson takes his frustration out on his club after failing to escape the rough

Clean break: The Swede broke his club cleanly in two over his knee

Stenson - playing with Tiger Woods - ended the hole with a bogey, taking him to one over for the round.

The Swede joked before his opening round that Woods had been worried over playing with him.

'I think it would have been a lot of sleepless nights for him as of late,' Stenson said.

'When did the draw come out? He looked tired didn't he?'

Stenson at least birdied the 18th to card a level-par 72 and said: 'If you want to sum it up very quickly it wasn’t my day. The birdies on 10 and 11 felt pretty good and the 12th hole felt good until I whacked it off the green with my putter and made double bogey.

'I got stuck (in the rough) on 17, could not get it out with two whacks and in the end it was a good bogey. I would have liked to be in red figures but considering where I was after three shots on 17, level par is not bad.'
