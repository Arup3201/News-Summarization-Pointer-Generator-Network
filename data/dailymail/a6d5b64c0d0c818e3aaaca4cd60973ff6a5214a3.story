Sam Burgess delivered his most impressive performance so far in rugby union, as the code-switcher scored his first senior try and was named man of the match in Bath’s powerful victory over Wasps.

The Yorkshireman, starting at inside centre, crashed over early in the second half at The Rec, helping his side wash out the bitter taste left by last week’s defeat at Leicester.

Tries from Francois Louw, Semesa Rokoduguni, Matt Banahan and Ollie Devoto completed the rout but Burgess was the name on everyone’s lips, as the rookie continues to develop his embryonic game under the world’s eye.

‘Sam played his best game but he’s still a long way from where he needs to be,’ said Bath director of rugby Mike Ford. 

‘He didn’t do everything right but it’s still early days. Straight away he came up and talked about how he needs to get better defensively.’

It was the Burgess show in the opening quarter. 

After making an early line-break, the 26-year-old made two bone-crunching tackles on his opposite man Ben Jacobs.

And in the 52nd minute he got his try. Running a line off George Ford, he evaded Jacobs, escaped the clutches of Alapati Leiua and Rob Miller and wriggled under the posts.

‘I was glad to get the monkey off my back,’ he said. ‘To slide over the line in front of the crowd was pretty good. 

'We spoke in the changing rooms that I might pop up on a wide haul and George managed to find me with a great pass.

‘The game wasn’t as slow as last week and I think that suited not only myself but the team as well.

'I got some clean ball and got my hands on the ball, so I enjoyed that.’

Wasps did manage the four-try bonus point through Leiua, Nathan Hughes and a brace from No 10 Alex Lozowski.

‘This league gives you a reality check very quickly,’ said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.

‘When you start thinking everything’s rosey in the garden, you get your trousers pulled down.’
