The rift in the Liberal Democrats over the prosecution of former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne was laid bare last night as his ex-wife Vicky Pryce welcomed ‘Camp Vicky’ guests to a party held annually at the couple’s home.

The party, which was co-hosted by the couple until their split in 2010, highlighted how their mutual friends have been forced to choose which ‘camp’ to join – an issue of divided loyalties that will be thrown into sharp relief by the upcoming court case.

Greek-born Miss Pryce, 57, shrugged off her worries to welcome high-profile allies to her £2.5 million townhouse in Clapham, South  London.

Divided: The party came a day after Miss Pryce (left) and Mr Huhne (right) were charged with perverting the course of justice

The party came just a day after Mr Huhne, 57, and Miss Pryce were both charged with perverting the course of justice over claims that he had used her name to escape speeding penalty points.  He strongly denies the charges.

More than 100 guests had received invites with their Christmas cards to the annual ‘post-Davos’ celebration.

Miss Pryce, a high-flying economist, has numerous friends who attend the meeting of the political and business elite in the Swiss resort at the end of January.

Most of the couple’s mutual friends sided with Miss Pryce in the immediate aftermath of the split because they felt she had been badly treated by Mr Huhne when he left her for his assistant Carina Trimingham, 45.

However, Miss Pryce’s subsequent actions,
including making claims about the speeding offence, have reportedly led
some of them to moderate their support.  

At last year’s party, the ‘Camp Vicky’ contingent was out in force, including former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell, a former Treasury colleague of Miss Pryce; Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott; Left-wing journalist Polly Toynbee; constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor and Labour MP Denis MacShane.

Miss Pryce can also count on the support of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s wife, Miriam, who telephoned her after the prosecution was announced on Friday to tell her: ‘If you need somewhere to stay, if the kids need support, we’re here.’

Points: How the Huhne speeding case has been reported

Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mr Huhne’s replacement as Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, are also regarded as supporters.

‘Camp
Chris’ is less colourful and less numerous – reflecting the former 
Cabinet Minister’s reputation for having few friends in politics.

Apart from Ms Trimingham, 57, Mr Huhne can count on Lib Dem president and ally Tim Farron, who this weekend described him as ‘the grit in the oyster’ in the Coalition.

Mr Farron said: ‘The reason why he was on the negotiating team at the formation of the Coalition, I was told by someone who shall remain unnamed, was because “Chris Huhne is a thug” and that he is someone who could go into the room and just negotiate a position and get the best possible outcome.

‘I hope he’ll be proved innocent. I hope he comes back very quickly.’

Mr Huhne can also rely on Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone – who chaired his leadership campaign in 2007 – Pensions Minister Steve Webb and controversial Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock.

Mr Huhne is the first Cabinet  Minister in history to be forced from office by a criminal prosecution. Miss Pryce has not indicated how she intends to plead in the case.

If she admits the charge, she could be called to give evidence against Mr Huhne. If she decides to plead not guilty, she will have to stand next to him in the dock.

The couple, who raised three children and two stepchildren during their 27-year marriage, are due to appear in court on February 16.
