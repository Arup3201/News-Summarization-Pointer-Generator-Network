DAVID Cameron was under further pressure last night to tackle the scandal of Shaker Aamer’s incarceration after a fellow Guantanamo inmate had his terror conviction quashed by a US court.

Supporters of 48-year-old Mr Aamer, who has been held in the camp for 13 years without charge or trial, said action was imperative after David Hicks – nicknamed the ‘Aussie Taliban’ – had his guilty plea overturned.

Hicks, who was the first of just six prisoners convicted of offences at the base in Cuba, admitted in 2007 to providing material support to terrorism – a deal which allowed him to return home to Australia.

The 39-year-old has since insisted he only pleaded guilty after being subjected to stress positions, sensory deprivation and music played extremely loud.

The US Court of Military Commission Review struck out the conviction on Wednesday, saying the charge had not become a crime until years after he was captured.

Last night campaigners said the Hicks case highlighted the plight endured by Mr Aamer who has twice been cleared for release – first by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by Barack Obama in 2009.

They urged Downing Street to renew pressure on the White House to keep the promise to free the father-of-four, who lived in South London with his wife and children. 

Cori Crider of legal charity Reprieve and Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘It is increasingly hard to understand why the affront to justice that is Guantanamo Bay remains open.

‘The overwhelming majority of people held there have never even been given a trial. 

Among them is Shaker, who has never been charged and continues to be held despite having been cleared for release by the US government.

‘David Cameron’s requests for Shaker to be released back home to the UK so far seem to have fallen on deaf ears – he must now redouble his efforts.’

Hicks travelled to Afghanistan in 1999, where he attended al-Qaeda training camps and met Osama Bin Laden. In late 2001, he was captured and handed to the US.

Pleading guilty allowed him to return home to Australia where he served only nine months of a seven-year sentence.

John Howard, Australia’s prime minister while Mr Hicks was in Guantanamo Bay, described the US decision on his verdict as a technicality, adding: ‘Nothing alters the fact that by his own admission, Hicks trained with al-Qaeda [and] met Osama Bin Laden.’

Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain.

 In 2001, he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim.
