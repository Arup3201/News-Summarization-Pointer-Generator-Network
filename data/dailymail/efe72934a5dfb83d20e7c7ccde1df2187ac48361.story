A coroner has condemned an NHS trust for its 'woefully inadequate' investigation after a baby died when surgeons cut into his skull during an emergency Caesarean section.

Carson Allen died from a massive haemorrhage just hours after he was born prematurely at Nottingham City Hospital on July 3 last year.

Doctors pierced a soft part of his skull while cutting into the wall of his mother's womb, causing severe blood loss, an inquest heard.

Assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire Heidi Connor recorded a verdict of accidental death.

But she criticised Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust for its 'woefully inadequate' investigation into the tragedy.

Following the hearing on Thursday, Carson's heartbroken mother Claire Smith, 38, a carer from Top Valley, Nottingham, said she would 'never forgive' the hospital for her son's death.

In a statement released with her partner Scott Allen, 37, after the verdict, she said: 'From start to finish, my care was absolutely horrendous.

Newborn babies' skulls consist of five main bones: two frontal bones, two parietal bones, and one occipital bone.

These
 are joined by soft spots - or 'fontanelles - which enable the bony 
plates of their skulls to flex and change shape during birth.

This allows babies' heads to pass through the narrow birth canal.

The ossification of the bones of the skull causes the anterior fontanelle to close by nine to 18 months.

Meanwhile, the sphenoidal and posterior fontanelles close during the first few months of a baby's life.

The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium.

'When I eventually went into labour the doctor didn't seem to believe me but I assured her I was having the baby.

'For Carson's life to end in the way it did is unacceptable. During my C-section, the doctor cut my baby's head so deep that he died. I will never forgive them for what they did.'

During the inquest, Miss Smith recalled the heartbreaking moment she found out her baby had died.

'I woke up and asked Scott what we'd had. I could not understand why he wasn't happy,' she said.

'I heard someone say "he's had two cardiac arrests" and I felt sorry for the person whose baby it was - then I realised it was my baby. 

'Then I heard someone say he had a defect on his head.'

The inquest heard Miss Smith had been 33 weeks pregnant when she went into labour and was taken to Nottingham City Hospital for an emergency C-section.

Dr Habiba Kapaya, assisted by consultant Andrew Simm, cut into her womb with a scalpel and managed to deliver Carson, but then discovered he was haemorrhaging from a wound to his head.

He was treated in intensive care and given oxygen because he also had underdeveloped lungs, while doctors fought to stop the bleeding. 

But tragically, nothing could be done to save the newborn and he died three hours later.

Mr Simm told the inquest that around one per cent of babies suffer cuts during a Caesarian section, saying: 'I could not see how a scalpel could cut through bone.'

But paediatric pathologist Dr David O'Neil, who conducted the post-mortem, said he thought the doctors had cut into the baby's skull while cutting through the uterus wall.

He told the hearing: 'It was at the back end of the temporal bones - made up of five bones that come together.

'There is a gap between them and there would be no problem opening up a skull with a scalpel blade in that area.'

The
 inquest heard that mother-of-two Miss Smith underwent a gynaecological 
procedure to treat heavy periods in 2011 that increased the risk of miscarriage and pre-term labour.

Miss Smith said that when she found out she was expecting Carson in 2013, she had told doctors she had previously undergone the operation - the exact details of which were not disclosed.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Mrs Connor said: 'Carson's head was closer to the side of the uterus than normal because of the previous surgery.

'I want to make this clear - this is not something that happens in a standard Caesarean section.'

Following the hearing, the parents' solicitors Nelsons said it was a 'very tragic case' and they were considering whether to take further action.

A statement from the hospital said the surgery was performed by a senior team and the complication was 'extremely rare'.

Dr Stephen Fowlie, Nottingham University Hospital's medical director, said: 'We reiterate our condolences to Miss Smith and her family for their loss.

'Carson was delivered by emergency section to maximise his chances of survival.

'The operation was performed by a senior and competent team of doctors.

'Sadly there were complications that could not have been foreseen.

'The pathologist concluded that this extremely rare complication caused Carson's death.

'It will never be known whether had this not occurred, Carson would have survived.'
