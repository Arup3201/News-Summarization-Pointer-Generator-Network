Maudine D'Elaine Young was arrested for an alleged affair with a teenage student in Texas

The wife of a former Texas school chief has been arrested for having a two year affair with a teenage student

Maudine D'Elaine Young, 46, who also worked at the same school as a curriculum director, is alleged to have met the high school senior for sex sessions in her car.

Their affair took place between 2009-2011 but only came to light after the victim, now aged 23, went to police earlier this year.

Young is married to the former superintendent for Greenwood ISD in Midland, Texas, where they both worked at the time of the alleged affair.

The student went to police on June 15th to make an official complaint about the sexual activity.

Investigators said Young began the affair with the student after calling him into her office,closing the door and kissing him.

The victim said Young later texted him and asked him to meet her in a parking lot before they drove to a deserted oil field lease where they had sex in her car.

According to the arrest report, the former student said he was a senior at Greenwood High School when Young called and texted him all that day and evening.

He said Young picked him up in the early morning hours from his parent's home and drove to a deserted field where they had sex.

Phone records between the victim and Young were subpoenaed and indicated several phone calls and text messages supporting the man's accusations.

Earlier this year she was moved from the job as curriculum director to that of assistant principal at Brooks Middle School.

The same month she moved, her husband stepped down from his $116,000 a year job as school's superintendent.

His decision to resign came before the allegations of his wife's illicit affair.

US Marshalls assisted in the arrest of Young at her home in Wise County.

Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter said Young's arrest was shocking but said sex between educators and students happens.

'It's a shock to me that an adult would conduct themselves in that manner. They know it's wrong, they know it's a violation of the law, they know it's illegal yet they still do it,' he said.

Young has been charged with engaging in sexual contact, sexual intercourse and deviate sexual intercourse.

She faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.
