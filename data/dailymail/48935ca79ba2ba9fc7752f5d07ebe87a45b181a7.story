Many of Britain’s most famous and traditional snack brands, from KP Nuts to Hula Hoops and Skips, have been sold to the Germans for a reported £500 million.

KP Snacks, which can trace its roots back to a Yorkshire food business established in 1853, is being sold along with its UK factories and 1,500 staff to Intersnack.

The brand, which was originally established in Rotherham and known as Kenyon Produce, has been owned by Britain’s United Biscuits(UB) since 1968.

Salty sale: KP Nuts is one of the brands under KP Snacks which has been sold to a German firm in a deal thought to be worth more than £500 million

Yesterday, UB said it was selling KP for an undisclosed sum, believed to be in the region of £500 million, to Intersnack, which already owns a number of snack brands including Pom-Bear, Penn State and Percy Dalton’s.

Intersnack, which is based in Duesseldorf, insisted that it is keen to maintain production in the UK, where KP is the second biggest snack brand behind Walkers.

The sale includes some of Britain’s best loved snacks including McCoy's, Hula Hoops, KP Nuts, Space Raiders, Nik Naks, Wheat Crunchies, Skips, Phileas Fogg, Discos, Roysters, Choc Dips, Brannigans, Frisps, KP Crisps, KP Mini Chips and Cheese Footballs.

KP is just the latest in a list of iconic British food brands to have been gobbled up by foreign owners.

There was a huge backlash when Cadbury was sold to Kraft of the USA, which then reneged on a promise to keep a key British factory open.

KP stands for Kenyon Produce and was founded in 1853.

It started as a confectionary, jams and pickles producer before moving on to nuts and later snacks.

The company was bought by United Biscuits in 1968 and now has three factories in the UK.

It makes some of Britain’s best-selling snacks including KP Nuts, Hula Hoops, McCoy’s and Discos.

The company's factory in Ashby de la Zouch won 'Factory of the Year' in 2004.

KP Snacks sell 90 million packs of KP Nuts per year.

Over five million packs of McCoy crisps are consumed each week and can be found in nearly a third of all UK households.

In October, many famous brands under the 
Crosse & Blackwell name, such as Branston Pickle, were sold to the 
Japanese company Mizkan.

Before that, Mizkan purchased Sarson’s vinegar and Haywards pickled onions.

Earlier this year, Bright Foods, which is part owned by the Chinese government, bought a controlling 60per cent stake in British breakfast cereal company Weetabix for £720million.

KP was founded in 1853 as Kenyon & Son as a producer of confectionery, jam and pickles. It switched to producing roasted and salted hazelnuts in 1948, for sale in cinemas, and later introduced peanuts.

The company launched Hercules Nuts in 
1952 and these were followed by KP Nuts in 1953 which remain Britain’s 
most popular peanut brand.

Intersnack
will take ownership of KP’s headquarters in Middlesex along with 
factories in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire; Rotherham, South 
Yorkshire; and Billingham and Consett in County Durham.

It’s executive chairman, Maarten Leerdam, insisted the brands are safe in the German company’s hands.

‘We are very pleased to be teaming up with KP Snacks, which represents a strong and highly complementary fit with the Intersnack family of leading businesses throughout Europe,’ he said.

‘Intersnack is a strong believer in the power of iconic, local hero brands, and we aim to leverage these strengths for further expansion.

‘As a privately owned company, we operate our business with a long-term view. As such, the joint know-how of KP Snacks and Intersnack will drive the development of these iconic brands.’

The UB group chairman, David Fish, said the new owners have the scale and finances to ensure the KP brands, which saw sales of £280million last year, can grow and reach new markets in Europe and beyond.
