Ferguson, Missouri police officers were shot at Tuesday night, as they tried to investigate a burglary call at one of the town's many buildings burned down in anti-cop riots. 

Officers were called to the shell of the old Beauty Town store on West Florissant Avenue on Tuesday night around 6pm, and found several suspects stealing hair products from the building's basement. 

While trying to arrest the suspects, the officers heard gunfire coming from the Park Ridge Apartments located behind the store.

They ducked for cover and then heard another round of fire coming from another location across the street. 

'It was a volley of rounds,' Ferguson police Sgt Harry Dilworth told St Louis Post-Dispatch.

They called for back-up and 15 to 20 minutes later, the area was cleared out and no one was injured.

A search of the area did not result in any weapons or suspects being found. 

Police do not believe the shooting was planned. 

The six looters arrested at the scene were charged with attempted burglary. 

The suburb of St Louis has been embroiled in turmoil ever since local teen Michael Brown was shot dead this past summer in an altercation with police officer Darren Wilson.

Tensions in the community became even more heated in November, when a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on any charges related to the teen's killing. 

The night the grand jury decision was announced, rioters took to the streets of Ferguson and burned down about a dozen buildings and destroyed ever more cars as police tried to combat the crowd with tear gas. 

Beauty Town was one of the several stores destroyed in the fire and looting, and the owner has set up a fund to raise money to rebuild. 

So far the fund has raise $6,015 of its $30,000 goal.
