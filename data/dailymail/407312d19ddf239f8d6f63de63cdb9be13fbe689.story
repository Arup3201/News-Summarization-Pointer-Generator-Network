The original pencil drawings for the prototypes of the temporary mobile ports - the Mulberry harbours - which played a crucial role in the D-Day landings in 1944 are to be sold at auction.

The secret wartime plans, designed and drawn by the Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes in 1942, are being offered by an anonymous American collector and are expected to raise between £40,000 and £60,000 at the Second World War sale at Bonhams in New York on June 5.

The makeshift harbour was one of the greatest military achievements of all time and its development was even described by Albert Speer - Hitler's architect and armaments minister - as 'genius'.

The original plans for the Mulberry harbour invention that allowed the Allied invasion of France on D-Day are expected to fetch £60,000 at auction. They were designed by Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes

Hughes came up with the earliest prototypes. His plans were drawn up during an intensive seven-week period, from June 17 to August 6, 1942 - two years before D-Day

The makeshift harbours in action during the Normandy landings in June 1944. They enabled the Allies to land troops, vehicles and equipment on French soil without having to capture a port first

The Mulberrys were a response to the need of the Allies to find a port large enough to accommodate the huge amount of supplies required to support an invasion of mainland Europe.

A Bonhams spokesman said: 'Aware that capturing an existing port in France was next to impossible, Hughes first proposed the idea of floating harbours to the War Office during 1941.

'His brother, a Royal Navy commander, brought the idea to the attention of senior staff and by that route to Winston Churchill.

'The Prime Minister was favourably inclined to the idea having proposed something similar as a member of the war cabinet during the First World War.'

In May 1942 - fully two years before the D-Day landings - Churchill issued a directive to Admiral Mountbatten: 'Piers for use on beaches. They must float up and down with the tide.

'The anchor problem must be mastered. Let me have the best solution worked out. Don’t argue the matter. The difficulties will argue for themselves.'

A Bonhams spokesman said: 'These documents contain the origins of the simple but devastatingly effective idea which transformed the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944. It took over two years to turn the concept first into plans and then into prototypes which, under conditions of great secrecy, could be rigorously tested'

Hughes devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together)

The 
spokesman added: 'The Mulberry harbours made possible the initial 
landings at Normandy and the continued supply of troops during the 
Allied invasion that turned the tide of the war. The enemy’s perspective
 on their value is especially revealing.

'At
 the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, former Nazi minister of armaments, 
was forced to admit that the Germans’ costly, two-year effort to 
construct Atlantic defences had been "brought to nothing because of an 
idea of simple genius".'

Hugh Iorys Hughes was chosen to head the project and the plans going on sale, drawn up between June and August 1942, are the basis of what eventually became the Mulberry harbours deployed in May 1944 in time for the June invasion of France.

The documents are Hughes’ own retained 1:44 scale copies, described by him as ‘proposed landing jetties’.

The plans drawn up over seven weeks and were finished by August 6th, 1942. The project test near Hughes’ home town of Conwy in North Wales was so secret almost a thousand men working on it were unaware of its true purpose.

The finished prototypes were subsequently towed to 
another secret test site in south-west Scotland.

There, Hughes’ efforts 
were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams.

The
 work at Garlieston, Wigtownshire in Scotland included development and 
testing of breakwaters, the idea for which came from engineer Robert 
Lochner.

He had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel, on the other side the waters were calm.

The Mulberry harbours were completed by May 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after. Their purpose was to ease and speed up the unloading process so that Allied troops were supplied as they advanced across France.

They were, as Churchill later wrote, 'to form a principal part of the great plan'.

Each of the two artificial harbours was made up of about six miles of flexible steel roadways that floated on steel or concrete pontoons.

The roadways were codenamed 'Whales' and the pontoons 'Beetles'. The ‘Whales’ ended at giant pier heads that had legs that rested on the seabed. The whole structure was protected from the force of the sea by scuttled ships, sunken caissons (a type of pump used in marine engineering) and a line of floating breakwaters.

They were comprised of a staggering amount of material - 144,000 tonnes of concrete, 85,000 tonnes of ballast and 105,000 tonnes of steel.

During D-Day operations, Mulberry A was installed at Omaha Beach, for American invasion forces, while Mulberry B was set up at Arromanches (Gold Beach) for the British and Canadians.Only two weeks after D-Day, a massive storm destroyed Mulberry A. Mulberry B also sustained some damage, but was reinforced to keep it operable at least until the end of October.

Mulberry B was left open until November 19 and Hughes was involved throughout, making adjustments and reinforcements. In that time this harbour landed 2.5million men, 500,000 vehicles and four million tonnes of goods.

Mulberry harbours were floating ports that allowed mass troop landings in the aftermath of D-Day

Winston Churchill himself authorised the scheme in 1942 after having similar idea during First World war

Even top Nazi Albert Speer acknowledged they were 'simple genius'

The documents were owned by the engineer behind the feat and could fetch £60,000
