Swift justice: Humberside Chief Constable Tim Hollis has questioned why criminals cannot normally be dealt with as quickly as rioters

A senior officer has blasted the courts system, asking why it could not always process criminals at the same pace used to deal with rioters.

Head of Humberside Police Tim Hollis praised the 'rapid and robust' response but also demanded to know why it normally takes courts so long.

He wrote in the Yorkshire Post: 'We really did see rapid and robust justice with offenders being arrested, charged, put before the courts and sentenced in days.

'This undoubtedly contributed to taking the momentum out of the disorder – but for the police and public it did raise the question as to why cases take so long to get to court in the normal course of events.'

Chief Constable Hollis also questioned 'why imprisonment is 
not used more effectively at an early stage for those who make the lives
of the law-abiding a misery on a more routine basis'.

In the aftermath of the riots, courts were organised to run overnight and David Cameron joined politicians praising judges and magistrates for taking a tough line.

In all 1,474 suspects had been before 
the courts, nearly two-thirds of them in London, according to the most recent Ministry of Justice figures last week.

The prison population 
has risen by 1,300 since the start of August, reaching 86,821 last week.
There remain 1,517 spare places in the prison system.

Much tougher sentences were being handed out in the wake of the riots which spread across English cities earlier this month.

Amed Pelle, 18, who incited 2,000 Facebook friends to commit violence and looting in Nottingham was jailed for 33 months last week, having encouraged them to  'kill a million police officers'.

Another looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months.

Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops.

But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour, he was still given a lengthy prison term.

Out in force: The cost of policing the London riots is set to exceed the cost of policing all the major public order events in the capital last year

Braced for impact: The Metropolitan Police say the figure will rise once they have paid the bills from the other forces who sent officers to help quell the trouble

The cost of policing the London riots
has spiraled to £34million with Scotland Yard expecting the figure to 
rise even further, exceeding the total cost of policing all major public
order events in the capital last year.

An 11-year-old boy was sentenced for arson and criminal damage five days before getting caught up in the recent riots, a court heard today.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole a bin from Debenhams in Romford, Essex, on August 8 after the windows of the store were smashed by looters.

He was given an 18-month youth rehabilitation order at Havering Magistrates' Court in Essex today after admitting burglary.

The court heard that just five days before the offence, he was given a referral order for arson, criminal damage and carrying a pointed instrument in an unrelated incident.

The 11-year-old, from Romford, is the youngest rioter in the capital to face prosecution, according to Scotland Yard.

He took the waste bin, which was worth £50, after a group of males smashed windows at the store, causing £6,000-worth of damage.

Passing sentence, District Judge John Woollard said: 'You seem to think that nobody can stop the way you behave.'

The boy was placed under an 18-month youth rehabilitation order, and told that his local authority will dictate where he lives for the next six months. He was already under a referral order, put in place on August 3, for an incident on July 18 when he cut the seats of a bus with a craft knife and tried to set fire to the exposed foam.

When the driver would not let him off, the 11-year-old threw a stone at the exit door of the route 174 bus, and then kicked a hole in the shattered glass so that he could jump out while the bus was still moving.

The district judge said the boy, who sat in court next to his mother, had been involved in a 'major disorder' just days after appearing before magistrates.

He said: 'My view is that the offence is a very serious one. If you were a little older, you would be ending up in prison, you would be looked after there rather than elsewhere. You need to understand very clearly that you can't get away with committing offences of this nature.'

According
to the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) the current estimate is set 
to rise significantly once the final bills from the other forces which 
were called in to help quell the disturbances are settled.

In
comparison, £34.8 million was spent on policing 42 major public order 
events between April 2010 and March 2011, figures showed.

As well as paying the salaries and overtime of officers brought in from other constabularies, the Met can also expect a hefty bill for accommodation as many had to be put up in hotels.  

A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Authority expects at this stage a figure in excess of £34million for policing the recent disturbances in London.'

Last year £7.5million was spent policing the student fees protests, £2.1 million providing security at the TUC anti-cuts demonstration, £1.9million on the Pope's visit to Britain and £2.2million on the general election campaign.

Chief Constable Hollis's comments 
came as magistrates rejected accusations from the leader of Britain's 
prison governors that there has been a 'feeding frenzy' in sentencing 
after the recent riots.

But
Eoin McLennan-Murray, president of the Prison Governors Association 
(PGA), claimed over the weekend that magistrates had lost all sense of 
proportion.

'It's like when you've got sharks and there's blood in the water and it's a feeding frenzy,' he told The Independent on Sunday.

'There's a sentencing frenzy and we seem to have lost all sight of proportionality.

'It's
appealing to the populist mentality, and that's not the best basis on 
which to sentence people. The norms of sentencing are being ignored.'

But
Magistrates' Association chairman John Thornhill said the claims were 
'unreasonable and unfounded', adding that it was 'just not the case' 
that normal sentencing was being ignored.
