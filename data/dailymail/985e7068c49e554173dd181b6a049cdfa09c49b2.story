Selfies usually mark happy occasions, but not for several University of Arizona fans who whipped out their camera phones Saturday night to mark their NCAA tournament loss with a frown.

Those selfies were taken to the next level by the fact that police were quelling rioting fans in the background with pepper spray and pepper bombs.

Right after the Wildcats one-point loss to Wisconsin in Anaheim, California, fans back home at the college's Tucson campus took the the streets in a disorderly display of disappointment.

Police action: The rioters threw beer bottles and firecrackers at the responding officers

Photographer Andrew Brown, 32, witnessed the riots while going to check-in on his girlfriend who works at a local shop.

He said the mood was so light that several students were taking selfies on the street amid the riot, so he documented a few of the photos in action.

'Those pictures sum up the night,' Mr Brown told the New York Daily News. '(The rioting) wasn't anything nefarious. It was just college kids doing what they do.'

'They were excited they were getting that much attention,' he added.

Loss: Students clashed against Tucson Police officers on University Avenue Saturday

Tucson police Sgt Pete Dugan said crowds leaving bars and 
restaurants near campus after the game filled University Boulevard and 
wouldn't leave despite urging through a PA system and social media 
declaring it an unlawful assembly.

Police
 brought in cruisers and a unit of officers with batons, helmets and 
face masks to block the street when people started tossing beer bottles,
 cans and firecrackers, hitting police vehicles and endangering 
officers. 

Officers fired 
pepper spray, pepper canisters and pepper balls, which disperse into the
 air when they hit, Dugan said. No tear gas was used despite some 
reports.

Rounded up: 15 people were arrested in Saturday's riots, but only one person was taken to county jail

Not happy: The university issued a statement following the riots calling them 'disappointing'

A witness, David 
Kitaeff, told The Associated Press that the incident started innocently 
with people taking photos, but then "people got in cops' faces." He said
 fans were throwing drink cans at officers, whom he saw marching down 
University Boulevard.

In total, 15 people were arrested but only one person was booked at county jail.

The university issued a statement calling the riots 'disappointing'.
