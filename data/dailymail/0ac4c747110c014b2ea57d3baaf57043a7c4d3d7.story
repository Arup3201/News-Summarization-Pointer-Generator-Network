Peter Schmeichel believes Wayne Rooney is the 'obvious choice' for the Manchester United captaincy as Louis van Gaal deliberates over his on-pitch leader for the forthcoming campaign.

The goalkeeping legend, who played for United between 1991 and 1999, says Rooney has the experience and the maturity to thrive in the role.

Van Gaal appointed Darren Fletcher captain on three occasions during United's pre-season tour of the United States, with Rooney and Tom Cleverley also awarded the armband.

Decision time: Louis van Gaal must decide which player to choose as captain for the forthcoming season and also gave the armband to Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley during the club's American tour

Tellingly, Rooney was captain for the match that concluded the tour, the International Champions Cup final against Liverpool, and Schmeichel is backing the striker for the job on a full-time basis.

He told Sky Sports: 'What I really like about Rooney is his attitude towards playing for United.

'Wherever the manager tells him to play he will do that with a smile on his face. He realises his importance to the team and if he has to play in midfield, it's for the team.

First of many? Rooney and Darren Fletcher, who captained United three times on their American tour, lift the International Champions Cup trophy after their 3-1 win over Liverpool

'You get that with experience and matureness. So I think he's the obvious choice for the captaincy.'

The captain's armband has been up for grabs since Nemanja Vidic departed for Inter Milan earlier in the summer.

Having now returned from the States, United have one remaining friendly - against Valencia at Old Trafford on August 12 - before they kick-off their Barclays Premier League campaign at home to Swansea four days later.
