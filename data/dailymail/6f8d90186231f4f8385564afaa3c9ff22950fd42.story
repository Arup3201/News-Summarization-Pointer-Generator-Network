The body of Eva Rausing may have lain undiscovered for four weeks as her loyal housemaid prevented anyone from entering her bedroom.

Her body was only found when police forced their way past a Filipino employee shouting ‘out of bounds, out of bounds’ as they searched for drugs.

They were alerted by a strong smell of decomposition after arriving at the sprawling £70million Georgian mansion several hours after arresting her husband.

Investigators now suspect Mrs Rausing, 48, may have died as long as four weeks before the grim discovery a week ago.

They are studying CCTV, banking and phone records, as well as statements from friends and neighbours, to try to identify her last movements.

Her sister Be, 47, said she travelled to London from the U.S. at the beginning of June but could not find her, despite banging on her bedroom door.

She said: ‘The housekeeper let me in and I went upstairs to her bedroom and I was knocking on the door and texting her and calling out to her and there was no reply.

‘I think my sister was in there, passed away. I’d been worrying for weeks. I suspected something awful had happened.’

Hans Kristian Rausing, 49, remained in
a secure hospital last night, receiving treatment for a mental 
breakdown and drugs withdrawal.

Mr
Rausing, whose fortune came from the £4.5billion Tetra Pak packaging 
empire, remains under arrest on suspicion of murdering his wife but 
cannot be interviewed until declared fit by medical staff.

The
advanced decomposition of her body has made the task of identifying how
she died more  difficult for police and pathology staff.

An initial 
post-mortem examination last week failed to find a cause of death and a 
second may take place this week on the instructions of her husband’s 
legal team.

Meanwhile 
investigators are waiting for the detailed results of a battery of 
toxicology tests that could indicate what role was played by drugs and 
alcohol.

The sensitive tests will also help pinpoint exactly when she 
died by measuring levels of chemicals produced naturally after death.

The news came as unsent emails composed by Mrs Rausing emerged showing her desperate battle with drugs and fear of death.

In
one, written in January 2010 and published in a Sunday newspaper, she 
appealed for help to her husband’s father Hans, who built the family 
fortune.

She said: ‘I 
realise that I will die and there is a part of me that desperately does 
not want to die and wants to fight, fight, fight but I am sliding and I 
am desperately calling to you for help.

'If nothing changes I will die, 
Hans. I just felt that I did not want to die without trying everything 
that I possibly could to reach you and to ask you to please help me.

‘Your son feels very, very hopeless. Although I stick close to him, I am losing my grip because I am weakening.’

Mr
Rausing was found with a small amount of crack cocaine after police 
pulled him over in Wandsworth, South West London. A team of  murder 
squad detectives, led by Detective Inspector Charles King, hope to be 
able to speak to him before the end of the week.
