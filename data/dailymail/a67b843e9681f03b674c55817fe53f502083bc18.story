A trainee nurse has been awarded over £75,000 compensation after a prick on her finger at work transformed her into a cleaning obsessive.

Alcinda Tobbal could not kiss or make love to her husband for fear of 'contamination' after being jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working as a nurse assistant at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London.

The 45-year-old developed a 'severe' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness after the incident in February 2008, a court heard.

She was dismissed from her job due to the effects of the extreme OCD condition, which saw her wearing gloves even in baking hot weather and scrubbing her children’s shoes with bleach whenever they had been outside.

But the most damaging aspect of her condition was that she became incapable of having intimate relations with, or even kissing, her bus driver husband, leading to the disintegration of their marriage, after he dubbed her 'mental'.

Now she has been awarded damages by a judge, including more than £20,000 for her ‘pain and suffering’, which takes into account the fact that her marriage broke down due to her condition.

Judge Edward Bailey, sitting at Central London County Court, said that the mother-of-five was employed as a nursing assistant and was working towards becoming a fully qualified nurse by studying at night school.

But her career was destroyed when she was accidentally stabbed in the finger by a dirty needle sticking out of an 'over full' sharps bin in an operating theatre.

Despite being given the all-clear after blood tests to rule out hepatitis and HIV infection, Mrs Tobbal’s distress and anxiety about what had happened to her continued to increase, with her 'main anxieties revolving around her HIV status', the judge said.

Her symptoms snowballed until 'a diagnosis of OCD at the severe end of the scale...making it impossible for her to return to work and having a significant impact on her life, most seriously on the breakdown of her marriage,' the judge added.

Whipps Cross NHS Trust admitted primary liability for the accident and its alarming consequences for Mrs Tobbal, but hotly disputed the extent of Mrs Tobbal’s difficulties and the amount of compensation she deserved.

Judge Bailey ruled that Mrs Tobbal ought to be compensated for her inability to work for the past five years.

He told the court: 'I am quite satisfied that her continued absence from work after her accident was as a result of the injury she received and her - albeit excessive - psychological reaction to it.'

He added that Mrs Tobbal 'developed a habit of compulsive cleaning' after the injury despite having blood tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV which came back negative two weeks after the accident.

'The average person, armed with normal fortitude, would have been able to get on with his or her life, no doubt making a firm mental note to be more careful of the sharps bin.

'Unfortunately, Mrs Tobbal was unable to get on in this way. She suffered from what can only be described as an eggshell psychology,' he added.

Describing her condition, the judge went on: 'She feels the need to clean and re-clean crockery, cutlery and her house generally.

'She began to wear gloves in everyday activities because she was concerned she might contaminate her family.

'She felt unable to go out, avoiding leaving the home and endeavouring for some time to prevent her children from going out, except for school.

'When they returned from school, she washed their outside school clothing every day and ensured their shoes were scrubbed with bleach.

'She felt unable to have any physical intimacy with her husband for fear she would contaminate him. This led, after an initial period of support, to the breakup of their relationship. 

'Even a kiss left her in fear of contamination and resulted in her need to wash.

'Of course, there is more to marriage than physical intimacy - Mrs Tobbal describes a good working friendly relationship with her husband whilst they brought up their children.

'But their emotional as well as their physical relationship has now broken down.

'While there was initial support from her husband, he now describes her as mental.'

Judge Bailey awarded her damages for five years of pain, suffering and loss of earnings, including more than £20,000 'for the disruption to her work, her life and her marriage', caused by her 'fear of contamination.'

However he declined to give her an award for future losses, saying Mrs Tobbal now has hopes for a brighter future, after her five years of hell.

The judge said that recent psychology reports had concluded that 'her prognosis for a return to her pre-accident state was good' if she undertook appropriate counseling.

Tara Vindis, for Mrs Tobbal, said of her client: 'She only has one friend as a result of her OCD.

'Her boundaries have shrunk and she lives a very insular life, focused on keeping her house very, very clean.'

Mrs Tobbal declined to comment after the hearing.
