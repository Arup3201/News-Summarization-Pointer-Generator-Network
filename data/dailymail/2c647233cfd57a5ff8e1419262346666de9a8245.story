Reigning champions Leigh will bring down the curtain on the inaugural Summer Bash in Blackpool with a Grand Final re-run against Featherstone.

The clash of the big two from 2014 will be part of a full round of Kingstone Press Championship fixtures at Bloomfield Road over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend.

The Summer Bash, which is the Championship's answer to Super League's Magic Weekend, will also include the first final of the new League 1 Cup, which will kick off the action on Saturday, May 23.

Rugby Football League chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said: 'The Summer Bash is a tremendous addition to the new-look Championship and I am sure rugby league fans everywhere will embrace the event and take the opportunity to spend a weekend at a venue which has a rich tradition of creating fantastic memories for the sport.

'Blackpool is the perfect home for the Summer Bash. Not only are there plenty of accommodation choices but the resort offers our fans many other attractions over the extended Bank Holiday weekend.

'With the dawn of a new era for rugby league and the restoration of promotion and relegation in 2015, every minute of every game matters and that will ensure the Summer Bash will produce drama of the highest quality.'
