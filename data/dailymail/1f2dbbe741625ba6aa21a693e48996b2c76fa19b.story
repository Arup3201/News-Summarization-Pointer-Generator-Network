It is the most Tony-nominated show of the season.

But the stars of Broadway sensation, A Gentleman’s Guide To Love & Murder, have told of their fears the show would close before it won 10 nominations for the prestigious theater awards - including Best Musical.

The musical - which last night dominated the Drama Desk Awards, scooping seven gongs - has had a long journey to Broadway following a string of workshops, out-of-town runs - with the producers even battling a lawsuit.

And despite winning plaudits from some of New York's toughest critics following its opening night in November, actress Lisa O'Hare admits the show soon 'struggled' to sell tickets, saying: 'There is no Daniel Radcliffe  - we don't have any huge names.

A Gentleman's mistress: Brit actress Lisa O'Hare plays opposite Bryce Pinkham as the conniving social climber Sibilla in Broadway hit A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder

British-born actress Lisa, who plays the conniving Sibella - tells MailOnline: 'We weren't grossing what we needed to, we were struggling until the Tony nominations and all the awards.

'But even then, audiences were going crazy and our producer Joey Parnes said 'this is going to be a long haul', to be honest, the subject matter and the title are a little bit strange!

'Now people are sitting up and taking notice and since our nominations we've been selling wonderfully.'

Having starred on stage in big hits Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady, Lisa tells how she turned down a show in London to appear in the workshop for A Gentleman's Guide, saying: 'I knew from reading the script years ago I wanted to be part of it, it's so rewarding to be part of something from the beginning, to see something grow and have this success.

'I believed in it from the beginning - I knew it had a future or deserved to have one. And I decided to take a risk!'

It took writers Robert L. Freedman and Steven Lutvak nearly 10 years to get the show to Broadway.

It
 tells a tale set in Edwardian England of penniless Monty Navarro, 
who upon his mother's death discovers that he is a long-lost relative of
 the aristocratic D’Ysquith family - and is in line to be the next Earl 
of Highhurst.

The only
 downside is that there’s eight relatives in front of him, so he decides
 to murder each D’Ysquith one by one and claim his rightful fortune.

The musical is based on the Roy Horniman novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal, published in 1907.

This book, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1949 film Kind Hearts and Coronets, starring Sir Alec Guinness.

But In 2010, the world premiere of A Gentleman's Guide was delayed because of a lawsuit brought by Kind Hearts and Coronets' rights holders, who claimed the show was based on the film.

The judge eventually ruled in the live show’s favour and typically, the show went on.

And
 Lisa, who plays Monty's married, spoiled and narcissist lover, said
 her husband, sound engineer Brian Shoesmith, who is currently working 
on another Broadway production If/Then with Frozen star Idina Menzel, 
kept a close eye on the show's weekly grosses, but said: 'I didn't look!
 I wanted to focus on my work.'

Her
 co-star Lauren Worsham, who plays Monty's betrothed, and eventual wife,
 Phoebe, is nominated for actress in a featured role in a musical. Last night, she won outstanding featured actress in a musical at the Drama Desk awards, while the show was named outstanding musical.

And
 she says she has grown so close to Lisa that despite the fact they play
 feuding femme fatales,   her first question after being woken up by her
 husband to learn she had been nominated for a Tony was 'What about 
Lisa?'

In the running: Hedwig and the Angry Inch star Neil Patrick Harris has received a nod for his role in the revival at the Tony Awards. Last night, he shared the prize for outstanding actor in a musical alongside Gentleman's Guide star Jefferson Mays

Most tipped: Neil Patrick Harris is beloved by Tony voters for popularising the awards as the host of the ceremony (for which he won three Emmys) and for his wonderful turn in Hedwig

She says: 'We feel like a team - you can't have one without the other, so I was very disappointed for Lisa.

'Sibilla is such a fantastic female role you don’t see very often,
she's complicated. She's a loveable but devious kind of a women who’s powerful.

And
 Lauren admitted she had feared the show would close, joking how cast 
member Jane Carr, the second Brit in the production, would come off 
stage every night, sighing: 'Well, I don't think we're going to be 
around much longer'.

'Then we started selling out tickets', she said.

Now the entire cast have 'all our fingers, toes and eyelashes crossed' for success at the Tonys on Sunday.

The show has garnered nominations for leading men Jefferson Mays - who plays the entire D’Ysquith clan - and Bryce Pinkham, who as Monty Navarro has become somewhat of a heartthrob.

Lauren
 laughed: 'Lisa and I get the old, slightly lonely dudes waiting for us 
at the stage door, but Bryce has all the teenage girls!

'He
 has that unique personality of a lot of big sex symbols, so you think 
he’s flirting with you! But he has grown more than anyone in the show 
and I find that really impressive.

She said the show has had some starry visitors including Claire Danes, who was in the audience last Tuesday. and Dan Radcliffe.

The
 cast of A Gentleman's Guide will join stars including Neil Patrick 
Harris, who has been nominated for Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which has 
eight nominations. Last night, he shared the gong for outstanding actor in a musical alongside Jefferson Mays at the Drama Desk awards.

Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder, Aladdin and Beautiful: The Carole
