The most encouraging aspect of England’s first netball victory of this Commonwealth Games was not the way they outwitted, outscored and outlasted a lacklustre Wales team.

Or the individual honours for Sara Bayman, earning her 50th cap, and 19-year-old Helen Housby scoring five times on her England debut.

It was their collective belief that a 65-25 victory was no more than they expected or deserved. It was simply an important step if they are going to win a historic gold medal a week on Sunday.

Outclassed: Sara Bayman (L) helps England toward a 65-25 victory over Wales at the Commonwealth Games

‘We’ll bank that,’ said 33-year-old head coach Anna Mayes. ‘But we know we need to be better tomorrow.’

She is right. Australia, who have traditionally dominated the sport alongside New Zealand, await this morning. Between them, the southern hemisphere sides have claimed every gold since netball became a Commonwealth sport in 1998.

Great expectations: England believe they can do better than the bronze that they won in Delhi

England have taken bronze three times. ‘At Delhi four years ago we were ecstatic with bronze,’ said captain Jade Clarke. In Glasgow, simply being on the podium will not suffice.

A 3-0 Test series win over  Australia last year has given them belief that they can disrupt the duality at the top — and Clarke knows the stakes are high.

‘It could be a breakthrough tournament for English netball, it feels like everyone’s watching,’ she said.
