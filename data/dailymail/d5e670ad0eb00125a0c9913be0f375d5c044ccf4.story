Tiffany Porter said she was inspired by the Mo and Jo effect to win gold in the 100m hurdles, praising the ‘feel good’ atmosphere in the Great Britain camp.

‘Hopefully this will kick start a further gold rush,’ she said after winning Britain’s seventh gold of the European Championships beneath the night skies of Zurich,

‘What we’ve done so far is really special. What made a real difference was the talk that our captain Goldie Sayers gave on Monday night. She mentioned that we should go out and compete as this was our last championships and that really resonated with me.

‘On Tuesday what Jo Pavey did spurred us on and Mo’s victory before I raced was really special. I am really happy and honoured to come away with a medal like them.’

Porter became the first British female in history to win European gold in the sprint hurdles. The 26-year-old, originally from Michigan, was the fastest qualifier in the heats and the semi-final.

She continued her dominance when it mattered, winning gold in 12.76sec. Porter got out of the blocks powerfully and maintained her lead over France’s Cindy Billaud, who finished strongly to take silver.

The 26-year-old, who won World Championship bronze in Moscow last year and silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘This is my first gold medal for Britain so I couldn’t be happier. I just focused on myself.

‘We all train to get the gold — I focused on my lane and performed well when it mattered the most.’ Germany’s Cindy Roleder took bronze in 12.82sec.

Ashleigh Nelson, 23, burst into tears after becoming Britain’s first female sprinting medallist at the European Championships for 40 years, emulating 100m bronze won by Andrea Lynch in 1974.

Nelson, who describes herself as a tomboy who loves fashion, finished behind the versatile Dutch multi-eventer Dafne Schippers and France’s Myriam Soumare.

She had run a pb to get to the final and clocked 11.22sec to clinch her first medal at a major championships.

‘I feel amazing as you can tell from the tears,’ she said, ‘I’m just so happy. My coach obviously knew what I was capable of. He said go into the final and give it everything and look what’s happened.’

All four GB one-lap specialists advanced to the final. The men — Martyn Rooney, Conrad Williams and Matt Hudson-Smith — all won their semi-finals. Hudson-Smith, who is the youngest of the trio at 19, was helped by veteran Rooney.

‘I had a few words of advice from Martyn saying just be comfortable, from my coach too who said just get to the final. I’ve got a lot of good people around me.’

Christine Ohuruogu won her 400m semi-final but looked laboured. ‘I didn’t feel fresh,’ she said, ‘But this is my first European Championships so I want to get a medal.’
