Suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that the attack's emotional impact will prevent their client from getting a fair trial

Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has made a second push to move his trial from the city after arguing that residents have already made up their minds he is guilty.

The 21-year-old's lawyers say the emotional impact of the deadly attack means people living in Massachusetts have 'an overwhelming presumption of guilt' towards their client.

In a document handed to the court on Thursday they claim a defence expert who analysed poll results and media coverage found there was little chance of Tsarnaev getting a fair trial in Boston.

Against the wishes of the prosecution, defence lawyers are now pushing to move the November trial to Washington, D.C. for the second time, where they say poll results show people are less likely to be prejudiced.

If that is not granted, they will ask the court to hold a pretrial hearing on their request.

Tsarnaev, 21, is awaiting trial for the horrific attack, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15 2013.

Three days after the bombing, the FBI identified Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev as suspects and released pictures of the pair.

Later that evening, a shoot-out with police left older brother Tamerlan dead, while Dzhokhar escaped, sparking an unprecedented manhunt across Massachusetts.

He was arrested the following day when a resident in Watertown alerted police after discovering Tsarnaev hiding in a boat in his garden .

Prosecutors say he and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, placed two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line in the callous attack.

In their original change of venue motion, filed in June, Tsarnaev's lawyers said a survey of potential jurors in Boston, Springfield, Massachusetts, New York City and Washington suggested that the nation's capital would be a more suitable location for the trial.

They said Boston residents were the 'most prejudiced' on a number of critical measures, based on the preliminary findings of a survey conducted in May. Their new filing adds more supporting details.

The filing counters prosecutors' argument that the court should first attempt to pick a jury in Boston.

The defence says it could be difficult to determine bias by questioning potential jurors, who might be affected by community pressure regardless of their own feelings.

They added that the large population of Eastern Massachusetts, cited by the prosecution, does not mean bias is less likely, since over half were at the marathon or knew someone who was.  

After a lengthy manhunt, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was discovered hiding in a boat belonging to a resident in Watertown, Massachusetts

They have cited the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case, when Timothy McVeigh's trial was moved out of Oklahoma in support of their argument. 

They also say that moving his trial 90 miles away to Springfield will not produce  different community attitudes, since their research shows it is 'a close second in prejudice' against Tsarnaev.

Their report also claimed moving the trial after a failed jury selection would only generate more unfavourable publicity, delay and waste of court resources.
