Manchester City chief Ferran Soriano has revealed that the £32million deal to sign FC Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala will signal the end of their summer spending.

Mangala’s arrival has been held up due to issues over third-party ownership but City hope to conclude protracted negotiations before next weekend’s Community Shield against Arsenal at Wembley.

The 23-year-old Frenchman has already passed a medical and agreed personal terms, and his signing will take the club’s outlay on new players this summer to a relatively modest £50million following the purchase of his former Porto teammate Fernando, Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

He shoots, he scores! Manuel Pellegrini has added Fernando to the club's midfielder ranks from Porto

With the Premier League champions restricted to a £49m net spend for breaching UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations, Soriano confirmed yesterday that there would be no more new additions to Manuel Pellegrini’s squad.

‘We don’t plan season by season, we plan in cycles,’ he said. ‘We knew one year ago the positions we wanted to reinforce in the team and we did it.

‘We have a new right-back, a new holding midfielder and we will have a new central defender and that’s it. We don’t need to sign new players for the sake of it.

‘We need to sign the players that the team needs because the team has a balance. To win you need to keep the balance. Our squad is very strong and it’s the second year they play coached by Manuel Pellegrini so they’ll do much better.’

Pellegrini won the title in his first season in England after spending nearly £100m on Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo, Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas last summer.

The focus now will be on which players to offload as City look to trim their squad and comply with UEFA’s punishment.

They are set to sell either Negredo or Javi Garcia to reduce the number of foreigners, while Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell are all expected to go.

City are also prepared to listen to offers for Matija Nastasic who will be pushed further down the pecking order once they have signed Mangala.

With the France defender due to start pre-season training on Monday following his involvement at the World Cup, City want to tie up his transfer as soon as possible.

Their remaining World Cup contingent – captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis – will report back to Carrington at the start of the week, although it is still unclear if Pellegrini and his squad will be back in England by then.

Even if City beat Olympiacos in their last group game of the International Champions Cup in Minnesota today (sat), they face a three-and-a-half-hour wait to see if Liverpool can clinch top spot and a place in Monday’s final by overcoming AC Milan in Charlotte. The peculiar situation means the players will not know if they are flying to Manchester or Miami until later in the day.

The Big Apple: Frank Lampard has become one of New York FC's first signings after leaving Chelsea

City are likely to be regular visitors to the US in future after launching their new franchise, New York City.

Frank Lampard and David Villa have already been signed for the club’s debut season in Major League Soccer next year, and Soriano believes that City’s involvement was critical in persuading the two men to move to America.

‘One of reasons David Villa and Frank Lampard decided to come to New York is because they know who manages and who owns the club,’ he said. ‘We have some very bright star players, young players in Europe we might ask them to come to New York to play before they play at Manchester City. There are all sorts of advantages.

‘I think this will raise the bar for the whole league. I think we will push the bar and others will follow.’
