Maxine Carr, now 37, served 21 months in jail for providing child killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi

Maxine Carr met her ‘besotted’ new husband on Facebook and spent months exchanging messages with him online before revealing her shameful past, it has emerged.

The 37-year-old, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, is said to have initiated the romance after finding him online.

Carr, who now lives under a new identity thanks to a lifelong anonymity order, spent months exchanging messages with the man who she ended up marrying in a £5,000 private ceremony last week.

According to sources, former teaching assistant Carr ‘entranced’ her lover, who is now said to be ‘utterly devoted’ to her despite knowing about her shameful past.

A source told The Sun: ‘He’s lovely and doesn’t like drama. He’s totally under the control of Maxine.

‘It took time for him to get to grips with who she was, but by then he was utterly devoted.’

He apparently had no idea of her real identity until she revealed it to him several months after finding him online, much to the surprise and shock of his family.

However, despite her past, the pair recently splashed out on a wedding at a three-star country hotel where guests enjoyed a three-course banquet and sparkling wine.

After exchanging vows in front of a registrar, the newlyweds posed for photographs on the hotel’s patio before toasting their nuptials with friends and family.

The former girlfriend of Soham murderer Huntley wore a £2,000 ivory dress for her big day and was given away by her 71-year-old mother.

Following the ceremony, the newlyweds departed for a honeymoon at a family-friendly resort, although it is not known whether they travelled abroad or remained in the UK for the romantic break.

Due to her lifelong anonymity order, Carr assumes a completely new identity and is said to have changed her appearance so she is not easily recognisable.

The order, which was handed to her upon her release from prison in 2004, restricts publication of details of her new partner or wedding because it could lead to her identification.

Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days.

Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental.

He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives.

Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation.

In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man.

She was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence.

Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions.

She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables.

Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.
