Theresa May was warned of a 'possible temporary shortfall' in G4S guards for the Olympics as early as June 27 - two weeks before she claimed, it emerged today.

She said G4S and Locog met at the Home Office at the end of last month and said they were 'experiencing scheduling problems' which could see a shortfall of 'significantly less than 1,000' guards.

But the firm was 'unable to specify the size of the shortfall' and only said they were no longer confident of reaching their workforce targets on July 11.

Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured in the House of Commons earlier this week, was warned of a potential security shortfall at the end of last month

The revelation, an embarrassing one for the Home Office, came to light in a letter from Mrs May to Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee.

It emerged as another 1,200 troops were put on standby to provide Olympics security tonight as the fallout from the G4S chaos continued.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the numbers of staff provided by the company were rising, and there was currently no need to deploy more military personnel.

Mrs May wrote: 'On June 27 G4S and Locog attended an Olympics Security Board meeting at the Home Office and said they were experiencing scheduling problems.

'They warned of a possible temporary shortfall in G4S deployed number from July 1.

Mrs May went on: 'Locog and G4S were pressed to clarify the shortfall and factors which had created it urgently.

Mrs May admitted that permission to put 'a small part of the MCF' on 24 hours notice was sought as early as June 28, with the force being mobilised 'several days later'.

Ed Miliband called today for G4S to be blocked from getting new Government contracts in the wake of the Olympics security shambles.

The Labour leader said no more deals should be signed until a review had been carried out to ensure the firm was fit to provide services.

He also accused the coalition of opening the door to private companies carrying out core police roles.

His attack came as Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated his vow to 'go after' G4S to make it repay the millions of pounds in extra costs incurred as a result of the fiasco.

G4S has rarely been out of the 
headlines since it admitted it had failed to employ enough staff 
to fulfill their £284million contract obligations.

As a result around 
3,500 troops have been parachuted in to help secure the Games as well as hundreds more police officers from forces around the country.

'People want bobbies on the beat, not G4S,' said Mr Miliband. 'We need to be much clearer about what private companies should and should not do.'

The comments came as Mr Miliband launched Labour’s campaign for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections in central London.

He insisted it 'beggared belief' that G4S was trying to cling on to a £57 million management fee for Olympics security.

But he refused to call for the immediate resignation of chief executive Nick Buckles, suggesting the Games needed stability.

'Clearly the company will have serious questions to answer about new leadership (after) the Olympic Games,' Mr Miliband said.

In a humiliating appearance before MPs earlier this week, Mr Buckles admitted there would be financial consequences from the company’s failure to recruit enough staff.

But he dismissed the idea of giving up the multimillion-pound management charge.

Mr Miliband said: 'I don’t think G4S should receive their £57 million management fee for services provided to the Olympic games.

'Frankly it beggars belief that they think they are entitled to it.'

There is speculation that a request may be made today for up to 2,000 additional troops to plug any further gaps in security if G4S’s problems become more severe.

The Ministry of Defence, which has already upped its contribution by 3,500, said contingency plans were in place to increase the numbers again if necessary.

G4S is already involved in £600 million of private work for the Home Office alone, and had been hoping to increase its share of the market.

However, Mr Miliband said the security giant’s ambition must be put on hold.

'Before they are awarded any new policing contracts, we need a review of G4S’s ability to deliver,' he said.

Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have stressed that they expect the Games to be a major success despite the problems as the row continues to overshadow the final build-up.

The Prime Minister has approved plans
to raise the number of military personnel deployed to protect the 
Olympics to 19,000 – double the number of troops now fighting in 
Afghanistan.

No 10 sources 
said the Government ‘will be very aggressive’ in reclaiming funds from 
G4S. Sports minister Hugh Robertson said lawyers have been deployed to 
trigger 'penalty clauses' in G4S's contract.

Speaking during a visit to Afghanistan, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'If a company doesn't fulfil its contracts, then that company should be gone after for that money and that's exactly what's going to happen in the case of G4S.

'I think it's very important that we allow them to try and carry out the role that they are contracted to deliver.

'But of course the Government's interest, the interest of the Olympic Games, the interest of everyone in our country is to make sure that whatever it is necessary to do to deliver a safe and secure and successful Games is done.

'We've always had contingency plans in place to deliver just that. We activate those contingency plans as and when necessary to do that.

'But I couldn't be clearer - we will do what is necessary and contracts that aren't fulfilled will have consequences, including pretty tough financial consequences.

'I think G4S, in apologising for their performance, have already made clear that they realise that fact.'

Later, Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure Olympic ticket holders from around the world that the Games would be safe and secure.

When asked at an Olympic Park press conference if yesterday's bomb attack on a bus full of Israeli holidaymakers in Bulgaria presented extra security challenges to the Games, the Culture Secretary replied: 'Obviously we're monitoring the whole time what's happening with respect to the changing security situation.

'We have extremely competent intelligence services who are giving us advice and we're responding to that on an ongoing basis.

'But the world can be absolutely certain that we will deliver a safe and secure Olympics. It's always been our number one priority.'
