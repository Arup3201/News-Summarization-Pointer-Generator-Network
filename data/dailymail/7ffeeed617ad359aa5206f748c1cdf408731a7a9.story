This is the moment a recycling bin turned into a 'monster' after a pizza parlour threw away a pile of raw dough.

The mass of ingredients was spotted overflowing from the council-owned bin outside a Papa John's restaurant in Edinburgh today.

It could be seen spewing out of the top of the bin - with bits of dough creeping out onto the street.

D'ough! This recycling bin was turned into a 'monster' after a pizza parlour threw away a pile of raw dough. The mass of ingredients was spotted overflowing from the bin outside a Papa John's restaurant in Edinburgh today

A photo of the 'monster' was posted on Twitter by civil servant Ailsa Burn-Murdoch, who spotted it on her way to work.

Alongside the image, she wrote: 'I have a
 feeling @PapaJohnsUK owe a local sanitation worker free pizza for a 
year.'

This afternoon, Papa John's blamed an inexperienced employee for the incident - claiming the staff member had disposed of the dough in a public bin by mistake.

A spokesman said: 'This
 isolated incident at our Edinburgh store was due to an inexperienced 
employee.

Scene: The 'monster' was spotted outside this Papa John's restaurant on Crown Street, near Leith Walk

'At Papa John's, we have a detailed waste management system and do not condone the use of public bins.

'We have since spoken to the store in question and 
implemented procedures to ensure it does not happen again.'

Mrs Burn-Murdoch, 32, said she had initially thought the mass of dough was a prank, before noticing it was outside a pizza parlour.

'I have never seen anything like it,' she said. 'I was on my normal way to work when I saw an odd look on a woman's face.

Viral: This afternoon, the photo of the 'dough monster' took Twitter by storm - with some users deciding to digitally alter the bizarre snap. Above, user @Dragonahcas posted an image featuring angry monster eyes

'She was walking in the other direction. She had obviously seen it. When I turned around, I saw this dough monster.

'At first I thought someone had put insulation in the bin as a prank, but I realised that it was outside a Papa John's and that it must be pizza dough.'

She added: 'They must have got the yeast balance wrong and then it continued to grow in the bin.

'The bin is designed for food waste - but obviously not for that much. I think it's pretty funny, but someone is really going to be annoyed when they have to clean it up.'

This afternoon, the photo of the 'monster' took Twitter by storm - with hundreds of users sharing the image with the hastag #doughmonster.

And it didn't take long for some users to digitally alter the bizarre snap - with one giving it angry 
monster eyes.

Following the incident, the dough was
 cleaned up by the owner of the restaurant on Crown Street, near Leith 
Walk, who then paid for the council to take it away.

The recycling bin, which is one of many placed on 
streets around Scotland's capital, is only for domestic use - with food supposed to be wrapped in 
newspaper or bags before being placed in the bin.
