Boxing legend Mike Tyson's new cartoon show - in which he solves Scooby Doo-style crimes alongside an alcoholic talking pigeon and a ghost - has premiered to some early harsh reviews.

The Cartoon Network's Adult Swim show, called Mike Tyson's Mysteries, features Tyson voicing himself alongside a talking pigeon, the Ghost of the Marquess of Queensbury and his adopted daughter Yung Hee.

Although it was well received when it premiered at this July's Comic-Con event in San Diego, early reviews have labelled it bizarre, insane and anarchic.

In the cartoon, Tyson's character is drawn in his blue training tracksuit complete with facial tattoo.

Episode one was inexplicably centered around novelist Cormac McCarthy enlisting Tyson's help to fix a case of writer's block and provide the end to his latest novel.

It also featured a chupacabra - which Tyson punched - as well as a centaur, tyrannosaurus rex and pterodactyl.

The makers appear to rely on the show's absurdity to generate laughs, but many noted Tyson's inability to pronounce 'Cormac McCarthy' was a highlight.

Besides the cartoon, Tyson has taken a number of acting roles in film and television and appeared in The Hangover back in 2009.
