Liverpool's bid to find a replacement striker for Luis Suarez suffered a blow when Loic Remy failed a medical in Boston on Sunday.

The £8.5 million move was almost a done deal for the France forward after he'd agreed personal terms and the release clause in his contract was activated, but after medical staff's examination the plug was pulled on the deal.

Now the sizeable boots of Suarez remain unfilled, SIMON JONES Jones looks at who else Brendan Rodgers could make a play for ahead of the 2014-15 season. 

Fallen through: Loic Remy's move to Liverpool fell at the final hurdle after he didn't come through the medical

Big shoes to fill: Now Liverpool is still without a replacement for Barcelona's Luis Suarez

Southampton

Value: £16m

Injured and out until October but Liverpool have made their interest known, as have Tottenham.

Southampton have also offered a new five-year contract to the 24-year-old but will accept the right offer as they have shown. A January bid makes more sense.

In demand: Jay Rodriguez will be recovering from a knee injury until October but is wanted by Liverpool and Tottenham, while Southampton have offered him a five-year contract to stay

Swansea

Value: £21m

Powerful, retains possession well and scores goals.

His performance at Anfield last season impressed observers and Liverpool alike but his wage demands and price tag did not when they made recent enquiries for the 25-year-old Ivory Coast striker.

Strong option: Wilfried Bony could be a weapon in Anfield's arsenal but money could be a barrier to any move

Real Madrid

Value: £40m

Ready-made superstar striker to fill Suarez's shoes but plays further forward and would put pressure on Daniel Sturridge's role.

Wages would be around £200,000 a week and, if the 26-year-old leaves Madrid, he is unsure about Liverpool as a destination.

Location, location: Would Karim Benzema be keen to move from Real Madrid to Liverpool?

Lyon

Value: £18m

The 23-year-old scored 23 goals last season and provides his fair share of assists. He has attracted attention from Newcastle, in particular.

However, if he leaves Lyon he wants Champions League football. Liverpool like him but he does not top their list.

Sevilla

Value: £15m

The 27-year-old is admired by Brendan Rodgers but may not be quite the step up in level Liverpool are now looking for. Is pacy and can play wide too.

West Ham made recent enquiries - as did Newcastle - for the Frenchman who scored 20 goals last season.

Not like for like: Sevilla's Kevin Gameiro is admired by Brendan Rodgers but is hardly a replacement for Suarez
