Two of the greatest icons in world football transcended on Merseyside to watch the crucial clash between Liverpool and Manchester United in the race for the Champions League places - and they won't have bee disappointed.

One of the best players to ever play the game, Pele, was in the stands to watch two of England's most successful clubs go head-to-head, as the away side came away victorious. 

The Brazilian was spotted standing next to Manchester United vice-chairman Ed Woodward and looked in a buoyant mood throughout the match.

Pele is in England to continue his promotion of a national sandwich brand Subway and spent time with former Liverpool legends Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman earlier in the week.

Legendary United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was also in attendance at Anfield as he continues to support the club he spent so many successful years.

With the race for the Champions League places hotting up, Brendan Rodgers knew that a win would have seen them leapfrog their opponents into fourth.

Despite Louis van Gaal coming under scrutiny this season, the Dutchman has his side in the European places and will count this campaign as a success if they can finish in the top four - and this result will go a long way to making sure they do just that. 

But two goals from Juan Mata and a red card just 43 seconds after coming on for Steven Gerrard condemned his side to a resounding defeat. 

Daniel Sturridge pulled a goal back for the home side to give them a glimmer of hope when he beat David De Gea at his near post.
