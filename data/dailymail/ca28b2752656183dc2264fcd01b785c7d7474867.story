Fifteen police officers have been hurt in a second night of riots in Belfast.

Three of them were taken to hospital after crowds threw 15 petrol bombs at police lines in the Carlisle Circus area in the north of the city.

The clashes came after 47 officers from the
Police Service of Northern Ireland were hurt on Sunday night 
during riots linked to a republican parade nearby and a loyalist 
protest.

Fifteen police officers were hurt yesterday in a second night of violence on the streets of Belfast

Last night's clashes came after 47 officers were injured on Sunday in the Carlisle Circus area of the city

Rioters hurled stones, bottles, 
fireworks and rocks at police, who used water cannon and six baton rounds in response.

A van was also hijacked in Denmark Street
and pushed towards police lines.

It is not yet known how serious the injuries sustained by the police officers taken to hospital are.

Terry Spence, chairman of the Northern Ireland Police Federation, said: 'Their bravery and courage is in stark contrast to that of the cowardly thugs responsible for trying to murder them.'

Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr 
said: 'I am very proud of how my colleagues stood in the face of danger,
working to bring this situation under control, but I am saddened and 
angry that again we find ourselves subject to serious violence from the 
communities we serve.'

'Let me be clear, we have made seven arrests already and with a robust criminal justice strategy in place, there will be more.'

'The community of North Belfast needs to see a resolution to this issue now.'

'Collectively, we cannot afford to wait and we cannot have night after night of violence on our streets. Following two nights of disorder, we have a number of police officers who are no longer available to deliver their core policing duties, protecting the communities they serve.'

Kerr said the violence had to be brought to an end.

'The huge impact on Northern Ireland cannot be ignored. As we strive to promote our positive image, the negative effect of these violent pictures on jobs, tourism and investment cannot be underestimated. We do not want to take a backward step,' he said.

'I urge all those with influence to urgently use it to bring a resolution to the violence and work towards a longer-term solution for the issues affecting this area.'
