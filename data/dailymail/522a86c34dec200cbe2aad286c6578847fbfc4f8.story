Mind of memories: Maureen Lipman digs up what is long forgotten in her new documentary

What are your earliest memories? Actor Sir Ian McKellen remembers waving to his mother from the back of an ambulance as he was taken to hospital with diphtheria — ‘or was she waving to me?’ he wondered.

Comedian Josie Lawrence has a clear recollection of dancing with her father, with her toes perched on his feet, and Sir Tom Stoppard remembers being chased around a Christmas tree by a man wearing a Devil costume — just the sort of surreal incident to make a playwright of a small child.

Most intriguing of all, these memories all date from around the same age: three years old.

As Maureen Lipman discovered in If Memory Serves Me Right, the human brain doesn’t store anything permanent from the baby and toddler years.

Even nursery children can’t remember anything before their third birthday.

Maureen, 66, made a delightful presenter, full of laughs and dry asides. The documentary was shot through with a vein of tragedy — she lost her husband, scriptwriter Jack Rosenthal, ten years ago, a loss that still brings her close to tears when she talks of it. And her interest in memory was sparked by the pain of watching her father Maurice succumb to dementia.

‘He lost so much more than his memory,’ she said. ‘He lost his essence and I lost the father I knew.’

But it was all far from doleful. Maureen threw herself into research: she underwent an MRI scan, analysing which parts of her cortex — the outer layer of her brain — lit up when she focused on recent memories or old ones.

She even examined cross-sections of two real human brains: one was healthy, and looked like compressed tripe, and the other was from a patient with Alzheimer’s, and looked like a Swiss cheese.

She experimented with false memories, asking hypnotist Paul McKenna to convince her that her dog had won Crufts (and that George Clooney had presented her with the prize).

The climactic segment was a bit of a let-down: Maureen embarked on a pointless challenge to remember the names and birthdays of 25 people she had never met. The rest of the programme had shown that memory is about so much more than parlour tricks.

It was disappointing, because otherwise the show had taken an innovative approach to science. Instead of being academic and geeky, Maureen infused the topic with human warmth that gave her discoveries relevance and meaning. I’d like to see more of this approach, putting science in a personal context.

The right presenter can transmute a leaden concept into TV gold-dust. Danny Baker was an inspired choice for a trawl through the telly archives on BBC4’s new comedy compilation, Brushing Up On . . .

This format shouldn’t have worked: the opening episode was a collection of clips from news magazines and children’s shows about Britain’s tunnels. In fact, it ought to have been deathly dull: there were features on pot-holing, on the sewers network, on the digging of the London Underground and on various abandoned efforts to construct a Channel Tunnel.

Sounds unpromising. But if you’ve got half an hour to spare on iPlayer, treat yourself, because the show was snortingly funny from start to finish. Don’t try to eat or drink while you watch — you’ll end up with hiccups.

From David Bellamy wriggling through Neolithic tunnels in his underpants, to Adolf Hitler surveying the English Channel through a telescope like a holidaymaker on the Calais promenade, these clips were a joy.

Sometimes it was the characters who were beyond parody, like the council worker sent into the sewers to hunt for National Health dentures: apparently it wasn’t uncommon in the Seventies for people to lose their teeth down the toilet after a party, presumably during the course of throwing up.

In other clips, the voice-overs raised the laughs, like the plummy Pathe News announcer in awe of the navvies digging the Victoria Line: ‘Men with iron in their muscles and buttocks, sons of Ireland almost all of them.’ Marvellously silly stuff.
