The man who runs the Sherlock Holmes Museum has launched a bizarre investigation to try to clear a notorious murderer.

John Aidiniantz has spent thousands of pounds – made from tourists at the museum – on preparing an appeal for the man who murdered Dr Lin Russell and her daughter Megan and left her other little girl, Josie, for dead.

Drug addict Michael Stone attacked Lin, 45, and Megan, six, in a quiet Kent country lane in 1996. Stone, now 53, was convicted after a fellow prisoner said he had confessed to him.

But Mr Aidiniantz believes the real killer is Levi Bellfield, 45 – the man who murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

He has set up a so-called ‘justice department’ in the ‘spirit’ of Sherlock Holmes, aimed at overturning miscarriages of justice, and is preparing evidence for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which refers cases for appeal.

The armchair detective, who runs the museum at Holmes’s fictional address of 221B Baker Street in London, said: ‘The trial and conviction of Michael Stone would have caused the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories to choke on his pipe.

Victims: Lin and Megan Russell were found dead on a country lane in Kent in 1996

‘We are in touch with Michael and he is 
delighted that someone is taking an interest in his case. But this is 
not about exonerating people. This is about catching the perpetrator.

‘This is what Sherlock Holmes did in the books. He was a forerunner of forensics to solve a case – and that’s how to solve the Michael Stone case, using forensics and not listening to the gossip.

You have got to look at the DNA rather than gossip of prisoners.

There is no DNA from Michael Stone on the big long lace, used to strangle Megan.

‘The DNA doesn’t lie and it rules out Michael Stone. We need the case to be looked at again.’

For Lin Russell’s surviving daughter, Josie, now 23, who has gone on to rebuild her life, it raises the upsetting prospect of having the whole case dragged through the courts once again.

Two juries, one at a retrial in 2001, found Stone guilty of the murders and in 2010 the CCRC rejected Stone’s efforts to have his case  reheard once more.

Last year the museum spent £10,000 on a legal challenge to try to get Kent Police to disclose DNA evidence which Mr Aidiniantz believes will open up the case.

But a judge refused the request, saying it was nothing more than a ‘fishing expedition’ that would not come ‘within a mile’ of casting doubt on Stone’s guilt. He added that Josie and her father Shaun deserved ‘finality’.

Other forensic investigations funded by the museum have already borne fruit. Omar Benguit who was jailed in 2005 for murdering a Korean student has had his conviction been sent back to the Court of Appeal.

Mr Aidiniantz gathered the funds earned from his museum in Baker Street dedicated to the character

Mr Aidiniantz is no stranger to controversy. He was sued by his 86-year-old mother Grace last year over control of nearly £2 million of ticket and gift shop receipts from the museum.

Mrs Aidiniantz helped set up the museum in 1999. She took the  claim to the High Court after family members raised concerns about missing funds.

But last night Mr Aidiniantz told The Mail on Sunday he had settled the case with his mother and that they were now on good terms.
