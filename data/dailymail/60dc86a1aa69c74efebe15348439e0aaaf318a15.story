An Italian couple managed to escape from their wrecked car after part of a bridge collapsed during storms.

Sussana Dursi, 47, and 62-year-old Roberto Bellocci were visiting Kodachrome Basin State Park in Utah when a road over the Praia River fell through.

The vehicle went about 150 yards downstream before it came to rest upside down in the swollen river - leaving the pair trapped inside. 

Tourists Sussana Dursi, 47, and 62-year-old Roberto Bellocci managed to escape from this car after it fell into the Praia Rive near Kodachrome Basin State Park, Utah, and turned over 

The car travelled down the fast-flowing river for 150 yards before it flipped over and left the couple, who had travelled from Italy, trapped

A car was passing over the bridge when she came to the hole. She alerted her relative, a member of the Garfield Sheriff's Department, to the damage but didn't know a car had fallen through 

The couple were somehow able to escape through a back window and climbed on top of the car, but they were still stranded.

A short time later, another vehicle passed over the bridge and phoned her relative, a member of the Garfield County Sheriff's Department, to report the damage. 

However the caller was not aware a car had gone into the water.

Deputy Clint Pearson arrived to inspect the damage but then started hearing faint cries for help over the fast-flowing river and then located the pair using a spotlight.

He said: 'I pulled onto the bridge and could see that an the entire southbound lane was gone. There was nothing there, it was a big hole.'

The pair somehow managed to climb through the back window of the car and make it onto the roof 

He added: 'They were in a very bad spot, and I was afraid that we were going to lose them and they were going to go on down the river and they were going to be very dead in a very short period of time.'

The two individuals suffered 'extreme hypothermia' and were taken to Garfield Memorial Hospital for treatment. They are expected to fully recover.

Kodachrome Basin Sate Park was also evacuated with local officials having to build a temporary bridge to allow visitors to drive over the collapsed pathway.

Flash flooding caused the river to rise and subsequently eroded part of the embankment that supported the bridge. Authorities had to install a replacement so they could evacuate Kodachrome Basin State Park
