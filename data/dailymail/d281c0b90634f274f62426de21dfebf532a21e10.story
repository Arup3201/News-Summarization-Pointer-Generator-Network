An 11-year-old girl has sparked a flood of donations after writing a bucket list for her mother who suffers from an incurable cancer.

Kate Smye, from Lowca, Cumbria, has written a list of dream activities to do with her mother Mel, 31.

She has battled breast cancer for five years and has now been hit with the devastating news it has spread to her spine.

Mel Smye, 31, has battled breast cancer for five years and it has now spread to her spine. Her 11-year-old daughter Kate, 11, has written a list of things she wants them to do together

Kate's heart-breaking list, which includes a girly shopping trip, seeing a show in London and visiting Legoland, has sparked a flood of donations to help the dreams come true

Things I would like to save up for to do with my mum and brother while she is still well enough.

Legoland or Thorpe Park. To see 1D [One Direction] or anyone really as we’ve never been to a concert before and always say we will.

To have a girly shopping day with mum at Glasgow.

To save up enough for my big dream would be to save enough to go to Disneyland Paris or to take my mum to see a show in London to have the experience I did with my school as she always wanted to go, but any of these would be good memories for us all :-)

Age 11

But Kate is determined to brighten her mother's last days, filling them with trips they can do along with her 15-year-old brother.

The bucket list includes going to Legoland and seeing the boy band One Direction 'or anyone really, as we've never been to a concert before'.

Kate also hopes to save up enough to take her mum to a show in London as it's something she has always wanted to do.

Mel had kept details of her illness between family and friends up until now but she made the decision to publicise her condition to help build memories for her two children which they can cherish forever.

Since Kate’s bucket list was launched on Facebook two weeks ago, offers of cash and help have flooded in from the community to help make the family’s dreams come true.

Mel, who works at Center Parcs, Penrith, Cumbria, said: 'It’s overwhelming what Kate’s doing. She’s only just turned 11, but she’s very mature for her age.

'Because of what we’ve been through in the last five years she’s grown up quicker than normal children. She’s just amazing. She’s a very special little girl.

'Both of my children are amazing and fantastic.'

The idea for the list came as the family talked about how to make the time they have left together as special as possible.

When they had written down some aims, Mel, who is undergoing monthly bone infusions and having regular radium therapy to control her pain, said that they would have to start saving.

She said: 'Kate doesn’t ask for a lot, we were not going to do anything extreme - just something we could work towards.'

But when the single mother told a close friend of her plan, she was hit with the stark reality that she wouldn’t be able to afford a lot of the ideas.

So the family, along with Mel’s friends, made the decision to launch Kate’s Bucket List and have so far raised £2,700.

They are organising a trip to London and Legoland and have been offered a villa in Florida for three weeks next February.

Mel said: "I’m fully aware there are a lot of other people out there in my situation.

'It’s very overwhelming and I’m very humbled by everything that is being done. Things are still raw but we’re not focusing on them.

'This has been a very positive thing for us to do.'

The family have also been given tickets to watch McFly at the Whitehaven Festival and will be taken to the concert in a limousine.

Fundraising events planned include an afternoon tea at Whitehaven’s Marchon Club, a coast-to-coast cycle ride, raffles and a bingo night.
