From Pakistan to Birmingham: Malala Yousafzai, 15, was gunned down by 
the Taliban in revenge for her campaigning on girls' education, but began her studies at Edgbaston High School for Girls

She had a five-hour operation to fit a
titanium plate over her damaged skull. She also had a cochlear implant 
fitted as her injuries had left her partially deaf.

She left hospital in January and yesterday started lessons at the fee-paying Edgbaston High School for Girls in Birmingham.

She has joined Year 9 and will be studying a full curriculum in preparation for selecting her GCSE subjects.

'I am excited that today I have 
achieved my dream of going back to school,' she said. 'I want all girls 
in the world to have this basic opportunity. I miss my classmates from 
Pakistan very much but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and 
making new friends here in Birmingham.'

Fresh start: Malala walked to school in Birmingham accompanied by her father, Ziauddin

Malala and her parents are now  rebuilding their lives after settling in Birmingham.

Her father has been appointed education attache at the Pakistan consulate in the city

Edgbaston High School is an 
independent day school for girls aged from two-and-a-half to 18. Founded
in 1876, it is Birmingham's oldest independent girls' school.

The Pakistani government will be paying her £10,000 a year school fees.

Her efforts saw her gunned down from point blank range by a Taliban assassin who stormed on to her school bus on October 9.

She escaped death by a matter of 
inches when the bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her
jaw, 'grazing' her brain.

Doctors in Pakistan managed to remove
the bullet and Malala was flown to the UK for emergency treatment at 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where staff are more accustomed 
to treating soldiers shot on foreign battlefields.

The schoolgirl's plight attracted 
international attention, and she became a symbol of the battle for 
girls' education around the world.

As surgeons battled to save her, supporters gathered to hold vigils, bearing signs emblazoned with the slogan; I Am Malala.

Just days after her operation, she was filmed sitting up in bed as she pledged to continue her fight to promote women's rights.

The 15-year-old was finally discharged from hospital 
in Birmingham last month after undergoing intensive surgery to try and 
repair the damage caused by the gunshot wound.

Today as Malala started her first day of lessons at Edgbaston High, girls around the world who are denied the right to an education were still at the forefront of her mind.

'I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school,' she said, before adding: 'I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity.

'I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham.'

British education: Malala has joined girls in Year 9 at Edgbaston High, where she will study a full curriculum

There was a heavy security presence at the £3,000-a-term school where the sealed front gates were manned by two guards.

One parent collecting her child from the school gates this afternoon said: 'The school know how much of an inspiration she is but they have told the girls to treat her like any other pupil.

'She doesn't want any special treatment and she has fitted in fine so far.

'Like any new girl at a new school, she was a little nervous. But she will be fine, I'm sure. It is a good school.'

Targeted: The young activist was transported from a military hospital to an air base in Rawalpindi to be flown to Britain after she was shot in October

Critical: The plane that carried Malala from Pakistan to Britain is seen on the runway at Chakala Airbase

Support: Campaigners gathered in Birmingham to show their support for the injured schoolgirl as surgeons battled to save her life at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital

Malala has been living with her father
Ziauddin, mother Toorpekai, 40, and brothers Khushal, 12, and Atul, 
eight, at a safe house in Birmingham.

It
is thought she may take up permanent residence in the UK after her 
father began working with the Pakistani consulate in Birmingham.

Malala's school fees are being paid by the Pakistani government.
