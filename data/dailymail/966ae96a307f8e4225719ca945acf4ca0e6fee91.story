To their many fans, Snooki, JWoww and The Situation may be irreplaceable - but MTV believes it has found the perfect group of reality stars to fill the whole they are about to leave in our lives.

Jersey Shore is set to air its series finale on December 13, and the network has just announced that its old timeslot will be taken by a new show centring around the wild lifestyles of country folk in West Virginia.

The boys and girls of Buckwild are set to bring a new backwoods spirit to MTV on Thursday nights, and will surely hoping to capture the nation's hearts in the same way as the notorious gang of guidos did.

Gang: Buckwild showcases a group of young friends living in the tiny town of Sissonville, West Virginia

Antics: The cast members seem to spend much of their time rolling around in mud

Country style: The Buckwild girls are not afraid to join in with traditionally masculine pursuits

It is easy to forget that when Jersey Shore first appeared in 2009, the cast was made up of complete unknowns.

So the nine residents of Sissonville, West Virginia featured in Buckwild have every chance of making the leap to national celebrities, like their tanned predecessors.

A trailer released by MTV warns viewers to expect lewd behaviour, raging arguments and sometimes incomprehensible Appalachian accents.

It opens with one of the girls saying: 'West Virginia is a place founded on freedom - for me and my friends, that means the freedom to do whatever the [bleep] we want.'

She adds, 'Our motto round here is: "Whatever happens, happens."'

Danger: The Appalachian residents seem to be enamoured of stupid and dangerous stunts

Suffering: This cast member rolled down a hill immediately after wolfing down 14 hot wings

Cutting loose: These West Virginians love a good party as much as their New Jersey predecessors

The trailer continues with a montage of reckless stunts involving large explosions, dangerous motorcycles and a bizarre amount of sliding around in mud.

The image of rural residents as backwards is promoted by an interview with high school prom king Shane, who says: 'I don't have no phone, Facebook... none of that internet stuff.'

And some of the behaviour shown in the trailer seems utterly insane - for example, when one cast member rolls down a hill in a tyre moments after saying, 'I just gone and eaten 14 hot wings.'

In many respects, there seems to be little difference between the stars of Buckwild and those of Jersey Shore - the West Virginians are shown fighting with their neighbours and indulging in dubious sexual pursuits.

Stereotype: The youths do little to dispel the popular image of country dwellers as rustic people

Fun: The cast members have known each other since childhood and describe themselves as 'family'

Old-fashioned: Shane memorably says, 'I don't have no phone, Facebook... none of that internet stuff'

One young woman can be seen fighting with her boyfriend, then promptly licking the torso of another cast member to celebrate his birthday.

However, the cast of Buckwild are keen to emphasise that they have a gentler side too, as the clip's narrator says: 'We all grew up here together - we're just like family.'

And the trailer's final scene supports this, as one of the show's gentlemen toasts the ladies, saying: 'Thanks for dinner, and I hope it tastes as good as y'all look.'

Sweet: The friends share a touching moment in between the fights and the swearing

New hit? MTV is hoping Buckwild can replicate the success of Jersey Shore after taking over its timeslot

Besides, while the cast may not seem particularly well educated, they are smarter than they appear - a number of them are college graduates who are simply enjoying the simple life in their home town before starting their careers.

Buckwild starts on MTV US on Thursday January 3 at 10pm.
