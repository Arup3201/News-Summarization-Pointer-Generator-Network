It was better late than never for Mario Balotelli as he started Italy’s World Camp boot camp an hour after the rest of his team-mates on Tuesday morning.

While the majority of Cesare Prandelli’s squad – England’s first opponents in Brazil on June 14 – started their first day of pre-tournament training in sunny Florence at 10.30am local time, Balotelli stayed indoors - perhaps the gym - before making his long-awaited appearance at 11.40am.

Holding a bottle of water as temperatures reached 80 degrees, Balotelli sauntered on to the practice grounds before doing a few laps around the perimeter of the practice pitch.

Acclimatising: The sweltering conditions in Italy should prepare them well for Brazil

Options: Cesare Prandelli will not name his final 23-man squad until June 2

Key man: The former Manchester City striker was Italy's star performer at Euro 2012

All smiles: The striker looks relaxed as he eventually joins in with the rest of the squad

Although the former Manchester City star hasn’t been in great form for AC Milan this season and is regarded as 'crazy' by most of Italy, there is no danger of Prandelli leaving him out of the final 23 because of his exploits at Euro 2012 when he and Andrea Pirlo were the major contributors to Italy reaching the final.

Monday’s atmosphere at the Italian football’s national technical centre in Coverciano – think St George’s Park at Burton but a lot hotter – was full of intrigue with Prandelli ready to wait until the final deadline date of June 2 before whittling a provisional squad of 30 down to 23.

Particularly anxious are the strikers. Former Manchester United star Giuseppe Rossi is battling with Serie A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile - whose pitchside sprints on Monday belied his name – and Antonio Cassano to get on the plane with Balotelli. Prandelli may even take them all if he takes an un-Italian like gamble.

Experienced: Parma striker Antonio Cassano, 31, is in the preliminary squad

Sweltering training conditions on Monday were tough going – good preparation for the England clash which takes place in the jungle city of Manaus.

Italy’s 30-man squad includes four survivors from 2006, most notably Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, and visitors to Coverciano couldn’t miss two giant pictures in reception of their last World Cup win; the first a team line-up before they played France, the second of goalscorer Marco Materazzi being mobbed by jubilant team-mates.

Italy don’t expect to repeat that achievement in Brazil this summer but they will always cling to hope with wildcard Balotelli among them.
