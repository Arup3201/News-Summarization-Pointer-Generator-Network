Cristiano Ronaldo has been said to have had a miserable demeanour of late at Real Madrid, but the current Ballon d'Or holder was all smiles while on international duty on Thursday.

Ronaldo showed his jovial side as he played a prank on Portugal team-mate Ricardo Quaresma - in a move that would have taken a lot of time and effort.

The 30-year-old took to Instagram later that afternoon to show off the artwork of his stunt - as he redesigned Quaresma's car with tinfoil into the style of his Nike Mercurial Superfly CR7 football boots.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Did you see what I did to @RicardoQuaresmaOficial's car on @nikefootball’s Snapchat?! And yes Quaresma, it’s still funny!!,' the devastating forward was grinning from ear-to-ear as he holds one of his trademark boots alongside the car.

The prank didn't seem to sit too well with Quaresma, however. He posted on Instagram: 'Seriously @cristiano ?! My newly redesigned CR7 #Mercurial car on @nikefootball's snapchat.'

Portugal coach Fernando Santos will be hoping his two forwards can let the prank slide and get things back on track as the Iberian nation prepares to host Serbia in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night.

Victory for Portugal in Lisbon would stretch their gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches.

Santos' men currently sit second in Group I on six points - just one behind leaders Denmark who have played a game more.

And the 60-year-old will be hoping his side can continue their recent good form which has yielded an 100 per cent record from their last three games including a 1-0 friendly win over Argentina on November 18 at Old Trafford.
