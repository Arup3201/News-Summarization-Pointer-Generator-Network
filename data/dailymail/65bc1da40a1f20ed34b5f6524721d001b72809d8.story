Newly-released tablet computers from Tesco and Argos could put children at risk of stumbling across porn because they do not come fitted with filters, an expert warned last night.

Tesco has brought out a cheap device called a Hudl, while Argos has introduced MyTablet which is aimed specifically at ‘tweenies’ aged from eight to 13.

Both are expected to be bought by hundreds of thousands of parents for their children at Christmas.

Tesco's Hudl tablets, which cost £119, could put children at risk of stumbling across porn, an expert has warned

But the Tesco tablet, which retails for just £119, does not come supplied with pre-installed filters which protect against adult materials being viewed by youngsters.

Neither does Argos’s device, costing £100 - despite advertising that it comes with ‘parental controls’.

John Carr, from the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said he was worried that the devices could expose young children to hardcore imagery.

Many other popular tablets, such as the iPad, also do not come with such filters, but Mr Carr said Tesco and Argos had greater responsibility because their cheaper models were more likely to be used by children.

He said he believed that Tesco had ‘dropped a clanger’, because with the Hudl ‘you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds’.

‘Argos in particular needs to re-examine what they are doing,’ he said. ‘They expressly state that they are going after 8 to 13 year olds. In other words they are going after young children.’

He added: ‘I imagine hundreds of thousands will be heading into children’s Christmas stockings this year.

‘This makes it all the more disappointing that companies that ought to know better have not gone the extra mile to make these devices as safe as they can be when they come out of the box.

‘True enough, other tablets on the market may not be any better than a Hudl when it comes to online child safety, but other tablets are not manufactured by a flagship British company.’ 

Last night Tesco said it was ‘leading the way’ on providing parents with information on how to protect their children, such as by giving them advice on filters when they switch on the Hudl for the first time.

They said they had been advised by charity Parentzone that this sort of education was more effective than installing a filter which can never block everything.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning in favour of an automatic block on online porn, with content blocked unless the user can prove via a strict age verification check that they are over 18.

Charities warn that easy access to adult materials can have damaging effects on youngsters, including warping young boys’ views of how to treat girls.

Tesco and Argos both offer tablet computers that are considerably cheaper than iPad models

The latest study by Ofcom fund that 37 per cent of children aged just three and four are going online, and 9 per cent are using tablets. These figures are likely to increase as the availability of cheaper tablets such as the Hudl gathers pace.

In July, David Cameron said he wanted to see all homes to be asked whether they wanted to install child-friendly filters. But on his blog, Mr Carr said that Tesco had undermined what the Prime Minister was demanding.

Tesco’s failing comes despite the fact that it has a representative on the high-level UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which brings industry and campaigners together with ministers. A member of the board is Tesco’s UK head of product development Andrew Uden.

Mr Carr’s blog goes on: ‘Straight out of the box if you only click Next or Enter, depending on the wi-fi connection that happens to be available, you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds.

‘Tesco have dropped a clanger. This is all the more surprising because elsewhere in the forest Tesco have shown considerable leadership when it comes to online safety.’

Mr Carr said he accepted that when the Hudl is activated, a screen comes up saying; ‘Sharing your Hudl with a child?’ which gives advice about installing a filter.

But he said that in many cases it would be children themselves switching the tablet on for the first time – and they would not heed warnings about filters.

Even if the parent looks at the advice, it is so lengthy that, on Christmas morning, ‘eyes will glaze over’.

‘Murder and mayhem have broken out in the living room,’ he said. ‘You might resolve to come back and check out the safety stuff later, but you won’t.

‘Little Johnnie or little Jennie will be off on their voyage of discovery with potentially disastrous results.’

Last night a spokesman for Tesco said: ‘We asked the experts, like Parent Zone, for advice. They were clear that the key is awareness raising and education.

‘We created an overlay screen that clearly guides users on online protection, going beyond what other manufacturers currently do.

‘We tested a wide range of filters but none of those currently blocks all harmful content. We didn’t want to offer parents a solution we didn’t have complete confidence in. If a reliable filter becomes available we will use it.’
