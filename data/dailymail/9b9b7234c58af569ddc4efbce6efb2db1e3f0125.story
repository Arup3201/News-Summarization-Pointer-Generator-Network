Ed Miliband is refusing to reveal Labour’s real plans for government in case they scare off voters, a senior Left-wing figure has claimed.

Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, a think tank with close links to Labour, lifted the lid on the row convulsing the party.

His comments will lead to speculation Labour is hiding even more radical policies from voters ahead of the General Election.

Lifting the lid: Andrew Harrop, a senior left-wing figure, has suggested Ed Miliband has refused to reveal Labour's policies in case they scare off voters

They came in response to bombshell claims by Labour’s policy chief that ideas by party policy working groups had been ‘parked’ by the leadership and replaced with ‘cynical nuggets of policy to chime with our focus groups and Press strategy’.

Jon Cruddas was recorded telling a meeting of the Left-wing pressure group Compass that there was a ‘profound dead hand at the centre’ of the party preventing the release of detailed policy.

The MP for Dagenham and Rainham, who is on the Left of the party, also criticised as ‘punitive’ a policy announced last week suggesting Labour could cut jobseeker’s allowance for those aged 18 to 21.

Claims: Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham and Rainham was recorded saying there was 'profound dead hand at the centre' of the party preventing release of policies

Yesterday Mr Harrop told the BBC News Channel: ‘Labour does have a problem of announcing very small policies that they’re trying to get a daily headline out of.

‘There is a struggle in the party between people who are being very cautious, not revealing too much in case they scare people off, against people like Jon Cruddas who says we have got to be big and bold.

‘You do need big announcements because at the moment people don’t know what difference the Labour Party would make.’

The row exposes the long-standing tension within Labour between those who advocate pushing radical ideas, and strategists who say Ed Miliband can win with the 35 per cent ‘core’ Labour vote. Last night, in an apparent effort to divert attention from the row, Labour pushed out a pro-business policy.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the party would commit to keeping corporation tax levels at the lowest of all the G7 countries if elected. Other measures would encourage longer-term investment in Britain, he will say in a speech today.

Mr Balls was forced on to the defensive yesterday as he claimed Mr Cruddas was ‘not frustrated’ but ‘excited’ about Labour’s policy agenda, and that his complaints were about how policy was presented to the public. He told the Andrew Marr Show: ‘We are all working together on these big reforms’. He insisted the party was coming up with ‘big ideas’.

At the Compass meeting on June 21, according to a secret recording passed to the Sunday Times, Mr Cruddas criticised the decision not to sign up to a 250-page report by the centre-left think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research and instead to launch the policy on benefits for young people.

‘The IPPR produced this report covering the whole gamut of social policy,’ he said. ‘We managed…to condense it into one story about a punitive hit on 18 to 21-year-olds around their benefits.

‘We set up independent reviews to rethink social policy, economic policy, democracy, local government – they come up with ideas and they’re just parked.

‘And instead instrumentalised, cynical nuggets of policy … crowd out any innovation or creativity.’

He added: ‘There is all sorts of creativity alongside a profound dead hand at the centre.’

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These comments prove Ed Miliband is a weak leader of a divided party. He’s just not up to it. Labour are not serious about fixing the welfare system.

‘Even Ed Miliband’s own policy chief attacks Labour as having “no interesting ideas”.’ 

Stephen Kinnock and wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt

A small group of families are retaining their grip on the Labour Party by letting their children ‘inherit’ seats in Parliament, Jon Cruddas warned last night.

His is the latest warning over the role of the so-called ‘Red Princes’ – the offspring of senior figures. Neil and Glenys Kinnock’s son, Stephen – husband of Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt – and Jack Straw’s son, Will, are both fighting seats at the next election, while Euan Blair and David Prescott are eyeing up moves in to Westminster. Mr Cruddas said Labour should devolve power to local people rather than let ‘certain families reproduce their control over the party’.
