England’s decision to change their team on the eve of the World Cup showed to me where we still are with one-day cricket. Would they have done the same to their Test side the day before the Ashes? No, they would have been ready to go.

Maybe those switches will work as the World Cup goes on. Gary Ballance might go on to be the answer for England at No3 in 50-over cricket and James Taylor, as he showed in Melbourne, could thrive at six.

It’s just the timing of those changes that was odd and we still seemingly have a less settled approach to the one-day game, which reminds me of the bad old days when people were worried about being dropped every couple of matches.

The timing of Ballance's move into the pivotal three role shows how England have failed to prepare

You could pretty much have named the New Zealand side for this World Cup a year ago but could you have said that England’s top three at the tournament would be Moeen Ali, Ian Bell and Ballance even a couple of months ago?

Now that England have made those changes they had to stick with them for Friday's game in Wellington and you have to say that, even though the timing was strange, Ravi Bopara cannot really feel hard done by.

I felt Bopara was unlucky to have been dropped when England played India last summer but maybe he came back with a little bit missing and was wondering when he would be left out again. He hasn’t been scoring enough runs and his bowling is just not used often enough any more.

Against Australia, England were too worried about strategy. There is a lot of time between games at World Cups which means a lot of meetings and a lot of thinking and that can lead to over-thinking.

Clearly, with the long square boundaries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, England’s plan was to bowl short but when it was not working they had to think on their feet. England players should have the ability to be instinctive.

Have plans, of course, but be prepared to change them. England’s bowling is far too one-dimensional. If the ball is moving around they have a chance against any team in the world but if it’s a flat, drop-in pitch they haven’t got a Plan B.

With plenty of time to think before games England can become too rigid when things are not going right

No-one needs to be instinctive more so than Eoin Morgan. The captain is at his best when he just does what comes naturally but again there is evidence that he is thinking too much. 

For instance, Morgan said the other day that he had to ‘re-engage with the belief’ he needs to have in his batting. That sounds like management-speak to me. Can you imagine Brendon McCullum saying that?

There is no question that Morgan is pivotal to England doing well in Australia and New Zealand. He hasn’t just been out of form in his five innings before facing New Zealand. The century in Sydney was the exception to the rule of his largely poor form going back a year.

Eoin Morgan needs to get away from the 'management-speak' and go back to his instinctive play

The England captain has been out of form for the best part of a year, but is still crucial to the team's success

We have all been through it. We have all had a scrambled brain over where the next big innings is going to come from. You feel the pressure, particularly as captain, but Morgan needs to deliver if England are going to prosper.

The World Cup so far has been pretty much what I was expecting. Teams, on the whole, are batting first and racking up 300 plus. Australia are clearly the stand out side, they tick every box, so England will not be the only side thumped by them in this tournament.

The associate countries are stronger than they used to be too. Ireland beating West Indies just wasn’t a surprise. It did not constitute an upset. 

Australia are the best side in the World Cup, and it won't only be England who suffer a heavy defeat to them

Ireland celebrate as the beaten West Indies side trudge off the field in Nelson after their defeat

Scotland, despite their defeat to New Zealand, showed plenty of steel, and are a well-prepared side

The Irish team was full of established players whereas West Indies were captained by a young lad in Jason Holder with very little experience of the big stage.

Scotland, too, with Paul Collingwood on the coaching staff, will be a well-prepared, committed outfit which is why England cannot just expect to beat the associate teams in their group and progress that way.

England have to get as far up their group as they can otherwise they will have a tough quarter-final back in Melbourne on a flat pitch and that means winning against the ‘big’ teams too. For them, the World Cup starts now.
