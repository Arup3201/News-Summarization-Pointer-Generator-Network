Scotland host England at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, with Roy Hodgson's side looking for their sixth straight win. Scotland, meanwhile, are undefeated in their last three games and full of confidence after their win against the Republic of Ireland. Here, Sportsmail's John Greechan introduces Gordon Strachan's expected starting XI for the clash.

CRAIG GORDON 

Age: 31 Caps: 40

The former Sunderland goalkeeper was out of the game completely for two years, beset by injury and dogged by talk he’d never return. After training with Rangers last summer, he signed for Celtic — and now wins his 41st cap four years after his 40th.

Craig Gordon has not played for Scotland for four years, but will start against England on Tuesday

STEVEN WHITTAKER

Age: 30 Caps: 27

The Norwich full back is likely to start on the right but can play on the left. He loves a mazy dash into opposition territory.

RUSSELL MARTIN

Age: 28 Caps: 15

Born in Brighton to a Scottish dad, the Norwich defender has a doggedness that helps him stick to strikers who should really be out of his league.

I played Scotland three times in my career and the games were always fast, furious and aggressive, but I’ll never forget walking out at Hampden Park. We felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive. That was the first half of a play-off to reach Euro 2000, so it was a massive game. 

GRANT HANLEY 

Age: 22 Caps: 16

The Dumfries-born centre half may give the impression of being a bit lumbering but he can shift. Great potential.

ANDY ROBERTSON 

Age: 20 Caps: 4

The youngest member of the starting XI, who was released by Celtic when he was 15, had only played 180 minutes of professional football the last time these two sides met.

You can’t call Scotland v England games friendlies. I had team-mates at Ipswich who I would play with and then against. You wanted to kick lumps out of each other, and that is what happened in those days. Mick Mills was our captain at Ipswich, but (with England) he was against us. You want to beat England and vice versa, that won’t change. But after the game we went on holiday together... and are still talking about it to this day. 

SCOTT BROWN 

Age: 29 Caps: 41

‘Broony’ is the kind of snarling, snapping, fiery Scot who used to give English opponents nightmares.

JAMES MORRISON 

Age: 28 Caps: 34

The West Brom midfielder usually sits alongside Brown deeper in midfield but can be used further forward where his passing creates chances.

BARRY BANNAN 

Age: 24 Caps: 18

Slight and prone to playing with his cuffs down over his hands, Bannan is a throwback to a different age. Hugely popular with fans, he plays in the three behind the striker.

STEVEN NAISMITH 

Age: 28 Caps: 33

The Everton forward carries a threat from any position in the three-man support unit behind the main striker. His work-rate makes him a certain starter.

IKECHI ANYA 

Age: 26 Caps: 10

Lightning-quick, Anya’s best Scotland moment came when he scored against Germany, later tweeting: ‘Can’t believe I beat Manuel Neuer. I don’t even do that in FIFA!’

CHRIS MARTIN

Age: 26 Caps: 4

The Scotland coaching staff really love the Derby County forward, who will deputise for the injured Steven Fletcher. Big but mobile, the 26-year-old is a former England youth player who qualifies for Scotland through his dad. Won the first of his four caps in May in a friendly against Nigeria.
