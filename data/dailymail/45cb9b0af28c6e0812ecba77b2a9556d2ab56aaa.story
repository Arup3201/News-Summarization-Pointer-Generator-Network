The makers of the online video hit 'Miami Zombie Attack Prank!' were forced to flee in terror from an angry member of the public when their latest stunt - a hoax bomb attack - went disastrously wrong.

Cameraman Jonathan Vanegas, ended up in jail after he and partner Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, both 20,   tried to fool a local man in Boca Raton, Florida, who reacted furiously and chased after them.

The 'Russian 
Hitman Prank' involved Zdorovetskiy dressed in a smart suit approaching people in the street with a 
briefcase which he claimed contained a bomb that was set to go off in 
less than a minute.

But it went disastrously wrong when 
Zdorovetskiy targetted 51-year-old local man Andre brown who failed to see the funny side.

The video shows Zdorovetskiy approaching Brown and the pair are initially racing away 
from the briefcase 'bomb'.

But things turn nasty when the Zdorovetskiy admits to Brown that it was all just a joke 
and that the entire episode was being filmed.

Visibly irritated, Brown  chases after the two men and appears to pull cameraman Vanegas to the ground before the video cuts out.

It resumes with Brown screaming: 'You trying to get a laugh? I'm not a motherf****r you laugh at.'

Vanegas was later jailed for 20 hours and faces a felony bomb hoax charge.

He told the Sun Sentinel: 'We go to the Boca jail, I'm shirtless for about four hours until I go to the county jail.

'It wasn't that bad, but the worst 
part about it was that I was detained on the first floor with 16 other 
cellmates and we don't have beds or anything.'

Cameraman Zdorovetskiy said he didn't regret trying the prank.

He added: 'I'm just sad the person got that upset.'

The video, 'Russian Hitman Prank Gone Wrong!' has had over 128,000 views.

Zdorovetskiy said his attempts to apologise to Mr Brown were rejected. 

Zdorovetskiy said: 'He attacked me, my camera guy, he threw me on the floor, he threw my camera guy on the floor.

both 20, have filmed a series of internet videos in which they are shown 
fooling members of the public

Miami Zombie Attack Prank: The pair's previous video in which Zdorovetskiy dresses up as a zombie and scares members of the public was a massive internet hit

'I was just screaming back "Sorry, I apologize."'

He added: 'The bomb squad came. Can you believe that?'

'The bomb squad came for this prank. It's unbelievable how law is these days.'

The pair's earlier effort, in which one is filmed dressed as a Zombie chasing people around the Streets of Miami became a youtube sensation attracting over 13 million views.

It was criticised for being tactless and insensitive as it was made just days after a Miami man had parts of his face bitten off by a drug user in an horrific incident that was dubbed the zombie attack.
