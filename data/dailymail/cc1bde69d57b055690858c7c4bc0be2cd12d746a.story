Gone: New Jersey teen Samantha Heckel, 13, was reported missing Tuesday night. She was last seen Tuesday morning near Piscataway, New Jersey

Police have located a 13-year-old New Jersey girl who went missing Tuesday morning.

Samantha Heckel was found in an abandoned home in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The house was next door to a boy from Dunellen's grandmother's house, according to MyCentralJersey.Â 

It has not been confirmed yet whether the boy in question is Samantha's boyfriend and rumored runaway companion Bryan Henderson, 16.

Before being located, Heckel was last seen on Tuesday around 9am in the Piscataway area, according to information released by the New Jersey State Police. She is from nearby Dunellen.

When the girl was reported missing Tuesday night, family believe she may have gone to a boyfriend's house in Piscataway. But when police checked the house, she was not there.

Samantha's cousin Zachary Wolfe added more information about her disappearance in a post on Reddit.

Mr Wolfe says his cousin went missing with Bryan.

He says police are looking for the two teens, but aren't treating it as an emergency because Bryan is a 'repeat runaway'.

'It is believed that they may have hopped a train to Newark,' police reported

Bryan's father won't report him missing because he is a 'chronic runaway'. Apparently he usually goes to Newark or to Allentown, Pennsylvania where he has relatives.

But because Bryan hasn't been reported missing, police will not issue an Amber Alert for Samantha.

'They claim the reason for her [not getting an Amber Alert] is because they are not sure if she was willing to leave or not,' Mr Wolfe told MailOnline. 'How that makes any sense, I don't know.'

Mr Wolfe says this is the first time that Samantha has run away.

'She is in fact an excellent student and [a] respectful kid. She rarely goes without contacting her mom for more than a few hours,' he said. 'This is completely out of the blue for her.'
