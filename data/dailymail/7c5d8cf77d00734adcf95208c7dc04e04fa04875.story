Candice Clark was denied financial assistance from the government despite having terminal cancer

A Darwin mother-of-two who was told by doctors she has less than one year to live, has been refused financial assistance from the government.

Candice Clark was left in a wheelchair in April this year after a tumour on her spine paralysed her from the waist down.

The 22-year-old was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a bone cancer, four years ago but continued to work as a car detailer in Palmerston until earlier this year.

In October, doctors told the young mother that she had less than a year to live and Ms Clark was forced to leave her job as her health continued to deteriorate.

She then approached the government and attempted to apply for the Disability Support Pension, but was ultimately told she was not eligible.

'Bloody unbelievable, I have worked most of [daughter] Enjay's life when I could just stay at home on [Centrelink], have worked the last four years, three years full time while I've had cancer when I could have been on disability,' Ms Clark wrote on her Facebook page.

'Now that I'm paralysed waist down and a cripple I'm not eligible for anything because of Steven, are you serious mate? Have to wait for my super.'

'Should have just lied like everyone else...'

Instead, Ms Clark was told she would have to rely on her Superannuation to pay for her medical costs, including her pain killers and a catheter, as her husband Steven's income was considered too high to meet the criteria.

She was also denied access to a Health Care Card or a Pension Card.

The 22-year-old was told to use her superannuation for her medical costs, but she argues she would prefer to leave the money for her two young daughters (pictured)

However Ms Clark told NT News that her family's financial circumstances had changed since the last financial year and she now thinks she is eligible for government support, preferring to leave her superannuation money for her daughters once she's gone.

'Enjay heard me talking to Steven crying and came in and said "it's OK mum, I'll quit after school care",' Ms Clark wrote on Facebook.

'My pain killers are like $70-$80 a fortnight and all the [things] I need for my catheter is like $70-$80Â  a fortnight. I get $600 a year to help with the catheter.'

Ms Clark is currently working through her Bucket List which included marrying her partner of seven years and an extended family trip to the Gold Coast.
