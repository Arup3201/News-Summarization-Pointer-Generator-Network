David Cameron and wife Samantha boarded an EasyJet flight to Portugal today, as politicians plotted their summer escape from the Westminster village.

Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister remained in charge after the Camerons and their three children boarded an 8am flight to Faro.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg jetted off to Spain earlier this week, claiming other senior ministers would be ‘holding the fort’ while the two most senior figures in the coalition were enjoying the sun overseas.

It is not the first time the PM has used a budget airline for his annual holiday. In 2011 he was pictured in a departure lounge waiting for a Ryanair flight to Granada.

Despite having six weeks to ensure either the Prime Minister or his deputy were in Westminster, both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg are on holiday at the same time – again.

MPs began their long summer break a week ago and are not due back in Westminster until the beginning of September.

Mr Clegg has admitted to being unable to co-ordinate his family holiday so it did not clash with the Camerons’, and other ministers will be in charge in their absence.

The Prime Minister and his deputy faced criticism last year after they both jetted off at the same time.

Questions were raised about the point of Mr Clegg was if he did not deputise in the Prime Minister’s absence.

Take a break: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and wife Miriam were pictured enjoying a drink at a coffee shop's terrace close to their summer home in Olmedo, Valladolid in central Spain on Tuesday

It is not the first foreign holiday this year for either man - Mr Clegg enjoyed a ski break in the exclusive Davos resort in Switzerland in April while Mr Cameron went to Ibiza with his wife Samantha in June.

On Tuesday Mr Clegg was pictured ordering a drink in a Spanish café with wife Miriam.

Every year the Cleggs go to Olmedo, the Spanish town which is home to Miriam’s family.

However Mr Clegg has admitted to wanting to travel further afield.

‘Now the kids are older I can get them to lobby against it,’  he was reported to have said.

‘Then I can say to my wife, “Sorry, Miriam, it’s not me – the kids want to go somewhere less dusty for a change.” ’

It is understood that after returning from spain, later in the summer the Cleggs will take a second break in France before returning to Spain.

By contrast the Camerons are having a low-key break in Portugal before making their annual visit to Cornwall.

They are also reported to planning a break in Scotland – in the middle of the campaign against independence.

However, senior aides were at pains to stress that Mr Cameron is still running Britain wherever he is in the world.

‘The PM is always in charge,’ said a Downing Street source.

Earlier this month Mr Clegg suggested that Home Secretary Theresa May and Foreign Secretary William Hague would be sharing responsibility for keeping the wheels of government turning.

Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘The Prime Minister and I, we try where we can. We’re pragmatic about these things to make sure that as much as possible, we don’t go away at the same time but there’s not always a perfect match.’

He revealed there would be a ‘short period of time where both the Prime Minister and I are away’ this summer. ‘We’re sort of trying to hand over the baton to each other,’ he added.

‘ We’ve got other senior members of the government: William Hague, Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and others who in those periods of time where either the Prime Minister or I are away; both of us for either official reasons or during the recess, they can also hold the fort.’
