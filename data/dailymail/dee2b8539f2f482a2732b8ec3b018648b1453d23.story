Gigi Hadid is one of the biggest names in fashion but remains a down-to-earth teenager 

But despite all of this, Gigi remains one of the most down-to-earth teenagers on the planet.

Her top beauty secret costs £3.99 and despite hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank, she insists on riding the subway in her adopted hometown of New York. 

In an interview with the latest issue of HELLO! Fashion Monthly, she credits her average upbringing at a high school in LA.

She said: 'I had a really regular high school experience, which I wouldn't change for anything. 

'I did modelling campaigns growing up but my mum made me wait until I was 17 to sign with an agency and I didn't move to New York and start working full-time until I was 18. 

It's given me a sense of perspective. I would say I'm pretty grounded still.'

BFFs Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner were back together again at Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel cruise, but it wasn't the only reunion of the night.

Kendall was kitted out in a pair of monochrome printed trousers but Cara opted for her favorite super distressed skinny jeans by Frame Denim. We've spotted her in them several times before and it's easy to see why. They've got a great snug fit, are mid-rise which is easy to wear and of course all that on trend shredding makes them a must have.

Unfortunately you can't buy these exact design anymore but click right to Neiman Marcus now to get a similar design from Neiman Marcus. Style like Cara with some lace up boots and a sports luxe sweater. Or work a simple tee and heels for fashion editor edge.

The model is currently has more than a few high profile campaigns to her name, including being hired as the face of VSPink and in an advertisement for fashion brand Guess. 

But the fact that her face is her pay packet hasn't made her precious over her appearance. 

She has a low maintenance beauty regime and regularly indulges in her favourite fast food - burgers.

She told the magazine: 'I definitely strive to be a low-maintenance model.

Some girls have their hair and make-up artist arrive five hours before an event, but I aim to do it in two hours max - I'm not trying to wake up at 7am for a 7pm event.'

The blessing of having the metabolism of a teenager means that she usually doesn't even bother to step up her exercise regime ahead of a fashion photo shoot.

She said: 'If I did I would never get to have a burger or take a day off from the gym for a movie marathon, which would not be cool. 

I do step up my regime before a Sports Illustrated shoot or if I'm shooting lingerie. And a couple of weeks before a fashion show, I'll eat more healthily and make sure I'm in the gym at least once a day boxing.'

Despite recently being announced as the face of Maybelline, Gigi doesn't even have much of a beauty regime.

When asked about her top skincare tip, she told the publication: 'I love St Ives Invigorating Apricot Facial Scrub; it's the best. 

'Garnier Micellar Extra-Gentle Cleansing Wipes are great for removing that first layer of make-up, and come in really handy when I'm travelling.'
