A builder who bought bolt cutters from a DIY store was shocked when staff reported him to the police for acting suspiciously.

Billy Fitzearle, 30, paid for three pairs of the tools for his work as a landscape gardener before police were alerted and went to search his home and van.

Staff at the Range store in Gosport, Hampshire, feared he may have been responsible for the series of bike thefts in the area.

Billy Fitzearle had his home and vans searched after staff at the Range told police he was acting suspiciously

When Mr Fitzearle, who lives with his mother, gave a ‘valid explanation’ no further action was taken by Hampshire Police officers.

But this was after his home, company van and personal van had been searched.

‘I'm just an average working man who wants to look after my family. Just because I bought bolt cutters does not mean I'm going to steal bikes,’ he said.

‘The police were happy that there was nothing wrong, but I was made to look like a common criminal just for doing my job.

‘It's disgusting that they could sell me something and then call the police and disturb my life like that.’

A Range spokesman said: ‘The store was made aware of numerous bike thefts in the area.

‘A decision was made to inform the police following the purchase of three pairs of bolt cutters and what they deemed as suspicious circumstances.’

They also stood by the decision to inform the police.

According to the Portsmouth News, Mr Fitzearle later visited the store where a manager apologised for the inconvenience caused.

A Hampshire Police spokesman said: ‘Officers were acting on information passed on by staff at a store in Gosport. They were suspicious of a customer making multiple purchases of bolt croppers after being made aware of an increase in cycle thefts in the area.

‘The customer’s vehicle details were given to police; this helped to identify the customer.

‘A valid explanation for the purchase was given to officers and no further action was taken.’
