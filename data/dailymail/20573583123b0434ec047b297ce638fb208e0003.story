Hillary Clinton, attempting to quiet concerns about the security of her private email system, said Tuesday she never discussed classified information over email.

And if hackers tried to obtain copies of her  communications, they couldn't have, Clinton said, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server.

'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference.

Security experts remain doubtful, however, that Clinton's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president.

If hackers tried to obtain copies of her sensitive, State Department communications, they couldn't have, Hillary Clinton told reporters Tuesday, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server

'To say it wasn’t compromised is to say, "I don’t know it was compromised," ' Stewart Baker, an assistant secretary at the the Department of Homeland Security during George W. Bush's presidency told Politico.

'It would be pretty easy for a nation-state to compromise that account, and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account,' he said.

The White House acknowledged on Monday that Clinton and Obama did email each other from time to time.

'I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.

The National Security Agency technician who was in charge of the team that built President Barack Obama’s specialized Blackberry, Dickie George, said it's unlikely the president ever said anything to Clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed.

'He’s actually very security conscious … There’s no, absolutely no, chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails, ' George told Politico.

Still, Bruce Brody, a former chief information security officer at the Department of Energy who is now oversee secuirty at Cubic Global Defense, cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between Clinton and Obama could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands.

'There’s more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think, just because he’s the president of the damned United States,' Baker told the publication.

A Q and A document sent to reporters by Clinton's staff after the former State Department official's Tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by the secretary and updated as needed.

Yet it did not say what those were, citing concerns that 'people with ill-intentions' would attempt to break into her security system, which Clinton says was set up her husband, Bill, a former president, and guards the private communications of both him and his aides.

The nine-page document disclosed, however, that  third-party experts were consulted. It did not name names.

Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union told Politico that unless Clinton 'was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure, it’s likely it was less secure,' however.

The State Department, he pointed out, has a full-time security team and the National Security Administration at its disposal.  

'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference

South Carolina Republican Rep.Trey Gowdy, head of the task force that' s investigating the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the State Department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault, said Tuesday afternoon that Clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection.

She also needs to answer lingering, 'serious questions 'about the security of the system she employed,' he said in a statement, and 'who had access to the server from the time Secretary Clinton left office until the time – almost two years later – the State Department asked for these public records back.'

Gowdy also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails Clinton says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the State Department can be retrieved.

Clinton says gave the State Department copies of all her work-related emails, yet 'without access to Secretary Clinton's personal server, there is no way for the State Department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public,' Gowdy said. 

The former Obama administration official said Tuesday the server will remain out of the government's grasp, however.

'No one wants their personal email made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she didn't think were pertinent to national security.

Should Clinton change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at Canadian computer company Sophos, says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server.

'If the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them, there’s a chance the emails could still be on the server’s hard drive if you forensically examine it,' he told the New York Times. 

'To make sure the emails are really destroyed, you would have to physically destroy the hard drive, which many companies and places like the Defense Department often do.'

Reporters flooded the United Nation's headquarters on Tuesday to listen to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet. A Q and A document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by Clinton and updated as needed

Another concern of government officials is that Clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address, which is against the law.

She says she didn't. 'Classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office,' the statement from her office distributed on Tuesday said.

But a former senior State Department official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the New York Times that Clinton's claim is dubious.

'I would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified,' he said. 'Was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified? Maybe, but it’s hard to imagine.'

Even if Clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email, 'there’s zero chance that she’ll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information, because she decides what’s classified,' Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, told the Times.

The secretary of state, he said, has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and isn't restricted.
