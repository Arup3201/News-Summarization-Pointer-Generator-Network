The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software

The
 dangerous cyber pandemic known as Gameover Zeus could have infected 
thousands of American computers and be lying dormant gathering data, 
experts say.

The malware, 
which the FBI estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million 
computers worldwide, has resulted in users losing tens of millions of 
dollars.

Gameover Zeus, 
which experts say is 'sophisticated' and capable of evading anti-virus 
software, infects a user's machine when they open a PDF or click on a 
link sent to them in an email.

Once
 it is set up on the computer, Gameover Zeus will intercept all 
financial transactions and rewrite them, so that payments made by the 
user will be redirected into other accounts.

The
 malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are 
made, meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear 
normal.

'It keeps track of 
balances; it automatically corrects the numbers on the balance. It's so 
sophisticated that it hides its tacks,' said Nick Savvides, senior 
principal systems engineer at software giant Symantec.

The
 malware has hit computer users around the world, with the most 
incidents reported in the U.S. and Italy – 13 percent and 12 percent 
respectively. Seven percent of incidents have occurred in the UK.

But
 Mr Savvides stated that many users could have downloaded the virus 
already and it may be lying dormant on their machines ready to be 
activated at any moment.

The Gameover Zeus malware has targeted computers in the U.S. with up to one million affected worldwide

Cryptolocker is malware run by the same gang behind Gameover Zeus and they are often installed on computers at the same time.

The
 Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 
'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their 
financial details.

Cryptolocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked.

The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files.

The Gameover Zeus malware was shut down by an international police effort this week, spearheaded by the FBI and Symantec.

This
 is the third attempt to shut down the malware, which first emerged in 
2011, and the FBI is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up 
their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network 
responsible for Gameover Zeus will be operational again.

Gameover
 Zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer 
software, meaning that even if the main server is shut down, infected 
computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue 
operating.

Another reason is that once installed on a computer, Gameover Zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software.

Computers
 are often concurrently infected with Gameover Zeus and a separate piece
 of malware, Cryptolocker, and there is some evidence linking the two 
pieces of malware back to an Eastern European network.

The
 Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a 
'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their 
financial details.

Cryptolocker then locks the information on the computer and holds it to ransom.

At
 the moment the software demands one Bitcoin, an untraceable form of 
online currency favoured by criminals, which is around $500.

In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained

According
 to Symantec data, three percent of people affected by the Cryptolocker 
malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the 
ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files 
once they have been attacked.

The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay this ransom to release sensitive files.

Earlier
 this week, the U.S. Justice Department filed papers accusing a Russian 
named Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev as being the leader of the gang 
behind the software.

The 
complaint claims the software has been responsible for the loss of more 
than $100m from individuals and a string of major companies, with 
estimates that members of the gang behind the malware would have amassed
 tens of millions of dollars each.

Could Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, be the behind the global cyber virus pandemic?

He is the man suspected of being behind a gang that has sparked a global cyber virus pandemic.

But
 the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy 
Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and 
‘slavik’.

The
 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a 
‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as 
‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers.

The
 software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal 
identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online 
banking accounts.

The
 FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator 
while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and 
phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites.

Victims
 who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which 
Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank
 accounts.

This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009.

Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ).

It
 is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer 
infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of
 dollars.

On
 August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname ‘lucky12345’ 
by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on a number of 
charges including Bank Fraud, Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud 
and Abuse Act and Aggravated Identity Theft.

On
 May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand
 jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy, 
Computer Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud and Money Laundering.

Then
 just days ago on May 30, a criminal complaint was issued in the 
District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of 
‘lucky12345’ to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank 
Fraud.

He
 is described as white with brown hair (though his head is usually 
shaved) and brown eyes. He is 5ft 9ins tall and weighs around 180 pounds
 (82kg).

Bogachev
 was last known to live in Anapa, Russia. He is believed to enjoy 
boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He 
also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia.

Computer users who fear they could 
fall victim to the virus are advised to install anti-virus software and 
ensure their operating system has the latest security updates.

Users
 are also advised to change their passwords, as original passwords may 
have been compromised during infection, and to enable automatic updates 
on their anti-virus software.

Users
 are also advised being cautious when handling unsolicited or unexpected
 emails, particularly during the two-week window before hackers rebuild 
their network.

Experts have also warned users to back-up all valuable data.

Many of those whose computers have already been infected will be contacted by their internet service providers.

Symantec has also produced a clean-up tool for infected users who need to get rid of the malware.

However potential victims only have only a short time to protect themselves before the hackers can rebuild their network.
