A excerpt from Clive Palmer's statement on why Mr Messenger was expelled from the party 

The statement does not go into any details about what those false claims are Mr Messenger is accused of. 

Mr Messenger has been working as Senator Lambie's chief of staff since her election and previously worked as a Queensland Liberal National Party MP and independent candidate, reports ABC. 

Tensions have been running high in PUP in recent weeks with Senator Lambie openly criticising the party's strategy.

'One thing I won't do is lie to the Australian people and I'm not going to sit here and make my PUP senators or Clive Palmer look good when I'm not feeling that way about them. 

'I won't do that ... I just don't feel like they're helping me out. So if that means I've got to go it alone under the PUP flag then so be it, I'll just run it alone,' she told ABC's 7:30 program on Wednesday night. 

Mr Palmer threw down the gauntlet in his statement made clear Senator Lambie had not resigned and should challenge him for the leadership if she was not happy.  

Mr Palmer did not go into any details in the statement about the false statements Mr Messenger had allegedly made

Mr Palmer said Senator Lambie was 'focused on her own quest for power' rather than representing Tasmanians

He said: 'If what she says about being unhappy with her party's leadership is true, she should make a challenge.

'Otherwise get on with the job of representing the people who voted for her.' 

It has come in the days since Senator Lambie refused to pass any government legislation even if it has the support of her party. 

Senator Lambie denied there was a split in PUP on Wednesday night but said her relationship with Mr Palmer is 'up and down', reports Channel Nine. 

Mr Palmer also branded Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' and said 'rational arguments rather than threats were required' if she wanted to help PUP achieve the best outcomes for the Australian Defence Force. 

He added his concern that Senator Lambie had never raised issues on ADF pay in the party's 'proper forum'. 

He said Senator Lambie was 'focused on her own quest for power' rather than properly representing Tasmanians. 

Senator Lambie addressed her critics on Thursday afternoon and said she was 'very happy with my electoral team' including Mr Messenger. 

She said: 'They are 100 per cent loyal to me, and together we are fighting hard for members of our Defence Force, War Veterans and ordinary Tasmanians. 

'I've requested that all my staff not be members of any political party. 

'I want a non-political office and Mr Palmer’s confirmation that Mr Messenger is no longer a member of the Palmer United Party saves him the trouble of resigning.

'Mr Palmer’s personal criticism of Mr Messenger is disappointing.

'Mr Messenger and I have worked well together after Mr Palmer gave us the job before the last federal election to create a Veterans’ Affairs and Defence policy.'
