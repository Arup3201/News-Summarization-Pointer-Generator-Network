Court claim: Abdel Hakim Belhadj says Britain collaborated in his torture

Silencing a Libyan dissident who claimed Britain helped deliver him to Colonel Gaddafi’s torturers has cost taxpayers almost £400,000.

Abdel Hakim Belhadj, an Islamist militant fighter, says he was subjected to ‘extraordinary rendition’ to Libya on the basis of MI6 intelligence and tortured with the help of British spies.

He would settle for a token payment of £1 along with an admission and apology, but Government lawyers have spent £372,632 trying to stop the case coming to court. 

They argue that a full hearing could damage relations with the US. Campaigners reject this, saying the Government simply wants to conceal its involvement in the case.

Ministers lost the argument at the Court of Appeal, which ruled in October that a British judge could consider the case even if it covered alleged wrongdoing by government agents.

They are appealing against that judgement, meaning the legal bill will rise even further next year when the case comes before the Supreme Court.

If the case does eventually come before a judge, ministers face having to reveal in full the extent of Britain’s involvement with Mr Belhadj and his wife Fatima Bouchard, who is also claiming compensation.

Legal campaigners said it was indefensible for the Government to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds to stop the public hearing the facts of the case.

Donald Campbell, of Reprieve, which is representing Mr Belhadj, said: ‘Surely a case involving such serious issues as rendition and torture deserves its day in court.

‘Mr Belhadj and Miss Bouchard have even offered to drop their case in return for an admission, an apology, and a token payment of £1 from each defendant.

‘Yet instead, the Government is spending staggering amounts of public money trying to ensure it is never heard at all. Sadly, this is all part of a bigger picture of obfuscation by the Government, which only emphasises the importance of holding a proper, independent inquiry into UK involvement in torture.’

A letter found in the bombed-out ruins of Gaddafi’s spy headquarters apparently shows Sir Mark Allen – then head of MI6’s counter-terrorism division – taking credit for handing Mr Belhadj and Miss Bouchard over to the regime.

Among Mr Belhadj’s claims is that Sir Mark is guilty of complicity in torture, conspiracy to injury, misfeasance in public office and negligence. The 48-year-old is also suing former foreign secretary Jack Straw.

The Treasury Solicitor’s department – the government’s legal office – has revealed it has paid out more than £30,000 on Mr Straw’s defence in the case and more than £113,000 on Sir Mark’s.

Deal in the Desert: Tony Blair shakes Colonel Gaddafi's hand at their now notorious meeting of 2004 

Mr Belhadj, a former Afghan mujahedeen who became a leading figure in the Libyan resistance which overthrew the Gaddafi regime, had been attempting to claim asylum in Britain.

He was captured in Bangkok in March 2004 and passed into the custody of the CIA who sent him to Tripoli. The CIA plane refuelled in the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia – raising serious questions about the repeated denials from Labour ministers that the UK had ever been involved in extraordinary rendition.

While he was held in Libya, Mr Belhadj says he was questioned by British intelligence officers who he says knew he was being tortured but did nothing to help him.

Sir Mark Allen (right), who is accused of handing Abdel Hakim Belhadj over to the Libyans, was also the spy who brought Colonel Gaddafi in from the cold.

The former head of MI6 counter-terrorism was the agency’s chief Arabist at the time of Labour’s love-in with the tyrant, and helped pave the way for Tony Blair to visit the dictator in Tripoli in 2004.

It was Sir Mark who forged close ties with Gaddafi’s playboy son Saif al-Islam and Libya’s ruthless intelligence chief Musa Kusa.

The 61-year-old father of two was on the advisory board of LSE Ideas, a foreign policy thinktank within  the London School of Economics, which tarnished its name by awarding Saif a PhD. Following this the Gaddafi Charity offered a £1.5million donation to the LSE, of which £300,000 was received.

After studying Arabic at Oxford, Sir Mark joined the Foreign Office at 23, and developed unparalleled contacts in the Arab world.

He allegedly entertained Kusa – also known as Libya’s former torturer-in-chief – at the Travellers Club on Pall Mall in 2003, the year sanctions against Libya were lifted. The pair allegedly worked together closely, with Sir Mark helping Kusa obtain telephone numbers and details of Libyan dissidents in the UK.

In one fawning letter found last year, Sir Mark congratulated his counterpart on helping mastermind a PR coup with the ‘deal in the desert’ between Blair and Gaddafi which helped secure drilling rights in Libya for BP and Shell.

Shortly afterwards, Sir Mark quit the intelligence service and joined BP as a £200,000-a-year adviser.

Details of his case emerged in secret documents found in the ruins of Colonel Gaddafi’s spy agency’s headquarters in September 2011.

As the regime crumbled in the face of an onslaught from Western-backed rebel fighters, investigators recovered a message apparently sent by Sir Mark to Musa Kusa, the feared head of Libyan intelligence and Gaddafi’s torturer-in-chief.

Crucially the documents appeared to show how he was ‘rendered’ just as Tony Blair was cosying up to the Gaddafi regime as part of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’.

In the files was a letter apparently from Sir Mark, dated March 2004, to Kusa, in which he tries to take credit for helping to apprehend Mr Belhadj, saying it was ‘the least we could do for you’.

Referring to Mr Belhadj by his alias, he wrote: ‘Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from Abu Abd Allah through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence about Abu Abd Allah was British.’

The fax also discussed arrangements for Mr Blair’s visit to Tripoli just weeks later where he would meet the tyrant, and complete a deal on oil and ending his development of weapons of mass destruction.

Mr Belhadj’s case is also the subject of a criminal investigation by Scotland Yard.

Both he and his wife say they underwent mistreatment at the hands of the Americans while they were held in Thailand and before they were handed over to Gaddafi.

He says he was blindfolded, hooded and forced to wear ear defenders before he was hung from a hook in the cell. He was then beaten and the ear defenders removed so loud music could be played into his ears, as he was interrogated by his captors.

Miss Bouchard, who was four-and-a-half months pregnant, was allegedly denied food and chained to a wall for five days.

In June the Government said Foreign Office files detailing CIA rendition flights on Diego Garcia may have been accidentally destroyed by water damage.

But in September it changed its position again, and said only ‘a small number of immigration cards… have been damaged to the point of no longer being useful’.

In 2008, David Miliband, the then Labour foreign secretary, had to admit that Diego Garcia had been used twice in 2002 for refuelling of rendition flights in the months after the 9/11 terror attacks.

Ministers have consistently denied prisoners ever left the plane or set foot there. But since then there appear to have been more flights.

Mr Straw has denied being aware of the rendition and allowing it to happen. Sir Mark has never commented publicly on the case.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Civil litigation proceedings are under way, so we are unable to comment on the details of this case.

‘The Government has been clear that it stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. We do not condone it, nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf.’
