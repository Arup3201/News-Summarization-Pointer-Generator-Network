TV star Justin Lee Collins subjected his girlfriend to a humiliating nine-month campaign of verbal and physical abuse, a court heard yesterday.

Among a series of bizarre demands, the comedian allegedly forced Anna Larke to help him compile a detailed dossier of her former lovers.

He also made her sleep facing him in bed and ordered her to throw away DVDs featuring actors she was attracted to, it was claimed.

On top of this, it was alleged that 
Collins told Miss Larke to close down her Facebook account, stop using 
Twitter and abandon her email address.

The court was told he even banned her 
from looking at other men, saying: ‘When you’re with me you look at the 
****ing ground, you look at a tree ... you don’t look at any other 
****ing human being.’

Miss Larke also alleged Collins, who 
appeared in the West End musical Rock of Ages, has a problem with 
‘people of colour’ accusing her of sleeping with men from ethnic 
minorities.

The father of two is accused of 
assaulting and harassing Miss Larke, 38, after he moved in with her in 
January last year following the breakdown of his marriage. He denies a 
charge of harassment by causing Miss Larke fear of violence between 
January and August last year.

St Albans Crown Court heard Collins, 
who found fame with Channel 4’s The Friday Night Project, initially 
showered Miss Larke with ‘beautiful gifts and lovely dinners’ and even 
put £1,000 into her bank account.

Former PR worker Miss Larke said: ‘It seemed like no big deal between being with the love of my life and being on Facebook.’

But she claimed Collins, 38, soon 
began a campaign of verbal and physical abuse against her saying she was
a ‘sex addict’ who was ‘riddled with’ sexually transmitted diseases.

The jury of nine women and three men 
was told Collins compiled a dossier of Miss Larke’s previous sexual 
encounters in a notebook.

Peter Shaw, QC, prosecuting said: ‘She
felt it was a disgusting thing to have to do and she was worried that 
she would lose him by doing it. But he told her it would help the 
relationship and help him deal with her past.

‘When Mr Collins was satisfied that 
Miss Larke had provided a sufficient amount of information he signified 
his satisfaction with the word: “Done”.’

Speaking about the notebook Miss Larke
told the court he had wanted a full account of her previous sexual 
activity.

She thought it was ‘weird’ but went along with it because she 
‘worshipped the ground he walked on’ and didn’t want to lose him.

Miss Larke said Collins demanded to know who she was speaking to on her phone or who she was texting.

‘He knew everything about me,’ she said. ‘It was the ultimate power really.’

The court heard how Collins had first 
met Miss Larke in 2006 when he was the presenter of the Golden Joysticks
video game awards and she was a public relations worker.

They had an ‘intimate’ relationship 
that was ended by Collins when he was exposed by the News of the World 
in 2008 for cheating on his wife with a woman other than Miss Larke.

Collins is the former host of the Friday Night Project. The court heard he 'insisted' that his girlfriend 'sleep facing towards him'

The prosecution claimed Collins 
contacted Miss Larke again in November 2010 via Facebook and he left his
wife shortly afterwards  and moved from Bristol to Kew in South-West 
London.

She said that he claimed to be unhappy in his  marriage and told
her he had had ‘six one-night stands’.

After Miss Larke moved in with Collins
he allegedly began to try to control her – even insisting she throw out
DVDs featuring actors she might be attracted to.

She told the court she
had been forced to dump a box set of the series Smallville because she 
had once fancied the actor who played Superman.

Miss Larke, a recovering alcoholic, 
also said she was sleep deprived because Collins insisted she always lay
in bed facing him.

She said he would wake her and criticise her if he 
woke and found she had turned away from him.

She added: ‘He would make me stay 
awake until he went to bed. This was sometimes four or five in the 
morning. He used to say if I fell asleep before him I was running the 
risk of him texting other women.’

The court was told Collins would 
physically assault Miss Larke by slapping her, grabbing her arms, 
pulling her hair and spitting on her face.

In a videoed police interview played to the court she said: ‘Anything would trigger it, there was such a temper on him.’

She said when he hit her in the face ‘my whole jaw and teeth were killing me and I would get bruises’.

In July 2011 Miss Larke said they had gone to a pub and she had suggested Collins cuddled her like a couple who were nearby.

This allegedly caused Collins to fly 
into a rage and when they returned home Miss Larke recorded his tirades 
on a mobile phone. The jury was played the recordings in which Collins 
can be heard calling her a ‘****ing slag’ and a ‘dirty vile whore’.

Collins was a ‘very depressed and 
angry man’, said Miss Larke. She said he once claimed he wanted to jump 
off Clifton suspension bridge in his home town of Bristol.

Miss Larke also claimed Collins left 
her in fear of her life. During her police interview she claimed he 
said: ‘Tell anyone what I have done and I will kill you and I’ll kill 
myself.’

The case continues.
