The battle to get the Budget through has taken on school-yard proportions, with Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus telling Education Minister Christopher Pyne to 'stop harassing me'.

Senator Lazarus, who is the Leader of the Senate for PUP, claims Mr Pyne is virtually begging him to support the higher education reforms and has urged him to stop his 'desperation'.

'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me and other cross benchers,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus.

War of words. 'Christopher Pyne is embarrassing himself and needs to stop harassing me,' said Senator Glenn Lazarus of the Palmer United Party

'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number,' said Senator Lazarus as the battle to get Budget measures through the Senate before the last sitting day becomes more desperate 

'I am being inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne virtually begging me to support the Abbott Government’s higher education reforms.

'I have never given Christopher Pyne my mobile phone number.'

The Senator claims that Christopher Pyne’s office and other Abbott Government ministers have been in constant contact with his office and those of other cross-benchers 'offering all sorts of deals and incentives to get our support for the higher education reforms'.

But Senator Lazarus insists that 'I won’t be bought and I am not prepared to horse trade'.

'It is clear that the Abbott Government is so desperate they will stoop to any level to win support.

'The majority of Australians do not want increased education costs.

'The higher education reforms are nothing more than a sinister Abbott Government budget cutting measure.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne insists that 'let’s be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms'

Senator Glenn Lazarus says he doubts that Christopher Pyne, pictured here talking with the Prime Minister, will retain the education portfolio in the new year

'The Abbott Government’s higher education reforms are bad to the core and will only significantly reduce funding to universities which in turn will significantly increase the cost of higher education in Australia.'

Senator Lazarus went on to doubt whether Christopher Pyne will retain the education portfolio in the next year and insisted that 'Palmer United will be voting down the higher education reforms'.

Any vote held this week on education reforms seem likely to fail.

With Labor and the Greens opposing the changes, the government would need support from 6 of the 8 cross-bench senators.

Mr Pyne will only say that he's still negotiating with them.

He stated that: 'In the final week of Parliament for 2014 the Government is urging the Senate to pass the vital higher education reforms to secure the future of our universities and spread opportunity to more Australians.'

'Without these changes our universities will be condemned to a slow decline – losing their competitive edge in our region and internationally.

'Let’s be clear: there is no viable alternative to these reforms.'

Independent senator John Madigan and Family First's Bob Day won concessions on student debt interest rates from the minister on Monday.

Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm could likely support the changes but even he is critical of the government's negotiating process.

'They're hopeless at convincing me to vote for their legislation,' he said.

Victorian Andrew Broad expects Mr Pyne to stump up some kind of support package for regional universities. That could sway a few votes.

Independent senator Nick Xenophon is still sceptical about what he believes to be a 'radical shift'. If it goes to a vote this week, he's expected to say no.

The third independent, Jacqui Lambie, has been steadfast in her opposition.
