The Coalition was riven by bitter infighting over green taxes last night after David Cameron ordered a review to stem the rise in energy bills.

Green taxes have been blamed for pushing energy prices to record levels, but the Prime Minister’s intervention met fierce opposition from the Lib Dems.

They insist the Government’s green energy targets are sacred.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said it would be ‘short-sighted and foolish’ to try to cut energy bills in the short term by tearing up the Government’s environmental policies.

But Downing Street said it was right to include green energy subsidies in a wider review of measures designed to ease the financial squeeze on families.

Asked if the government was going to review green taxes, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘You would expect us, when families’ budgets are under pressure, to look at whether or not more can be done to help them. That’s what the Government will be doing.’

The review is expected to focus on the £1.3billion-a-year Energy Companies Obligation (Eco) scheme, which the energy firms claim will add £100 a year to bills.

But other green taxes, including subsidies for windfarms and the so-called carbon price floor, which is expected to raise £1billion a year for the Government, could also come under the spotlight.

The Prime Minister said this week he did not want costly subsidies for windfarms and other renewable energy to last ‘a minute longer than is necessary’.

Chancellor George Osborne is also pushing for changes to green subsidies and taxes to ease energy prices.

The pressure has mounted since Labour leader Ed Miliband announced he would freeze energy bills for 20 months if Labour won power in 2015 – despite having admitted in 2009 that the green taxes he brought in as Energy Minister in the Labour government were bound to push energy prices up.

Mr Cameron has dismissed the pledge as a ‘con’, but ministers fear the simple message could prove popular with hard-pressed voters struggling to cope with soaring bills.

Some Tory ministers are pushing for the party to enter the next election pledging to scrap, water down or delay a string of green measures to bring down energy bills.

Mr Osborne is keen to see some progress before his autumn statement on the economy in December.

But major change is likely to be frustrated by deep-seated opposition from the Lib Dems.

‘The Tories can say what they want, but we will not back down on this,’ a Lib Dem source said last night.

The Eco scheme is a levy on energy companies used to insulate the homes of people living in fuel poverty, who are defined as those spending more than 10 per cent of their income on heating.

Much of the cost of the scheme is passed on to consumers in the form of higher bills.

But the Lib Dems will fight any attempt to dilute or scrap the schemes.

One Lib Dem source said: ‘The Tories keep talking about energy prices but we are talking about bills. Insulating homes will get bills down in the long run.’

Mr Cable yesterday acknowledged there was a ‘continuing argument’ within Government about the balance between green targets and affordable energy.

He insisted the Lib Dems would not back down, adding: ‘If you are taking a long-term view about shifting the British economy on to a less polluting, a less carbon-based system we have to provide those incentives.

‘What will happen in the long term is that the cost of renewable energy will fall.’

The row follows the controversial announcement by energy giant SSE that it will hike prices by 8.2 per cent this winter.

On average, dual-fuel bills for millions of SSE customers will rise by £111 to £1,465 a year, the highest price ever seen in the country. Other major power firms are expected to follow suit.

Energy minister Michael Fallon urged the firm’s customers to shop around for a better deal.

But SSE boss Alistair Phillips-Davies said the Government could help by scaling back green taxes and slowing the replacement of cheap fossil fuels with dearer renewable power.

He said: ‘If we carry on firmly behind the green agenda we will continue to have price increases like this.’
