Andrea Green, 42, died 14 hours after routine surgery for her back pain, which may have been unnecessary

A patient bled to death following the 'gross failure' of a doctor to give her a life-saving blood transfusion before it was too late.

Andrea Green, 42, died 14 hours after a routine operation for back pain, which may have been unnecessary, an inquest heard.

Consultant surgeon Hany Ismaiel accidentally cut an artery during the operation and staff at Barnsley District Hospital failed to pick up on subsequent internal bleeding.

Locum senior house officer Dr Oluwatosin Taiwo, who trained in Nigeria, failed to act 'promptly and efficiently' to give her a transfusion, according to a coroner.

The medic knew Miss Green had suffered a ‘massive blood loss’ but instead of giving her the transfusion when blood became ready he called for more tests.

In delivering her findings, assistant Sheffield coroner Siobhan Kelly said: ‘It was a gross failure of basic medical attention for the doctor not to ensure the blood transfusion took place as soon as possible after the blood was ready. Had he done so Andrea Green would have lived.’

In her verdict, Ms Kelly said neglect contributed to Miss Green’s death at Barnsley District Hospital on March 13 2010 in that the transfusion should have been given more quickly.

The inquest heard Dr Taiwo had only been working at the hospital for a week-and-a-half and did not have full orthopaedic experience. He no longer works there.

Although he became aware of the blood loss at 11.40pm he ‘did not appreciate the severity of the situation’ and gave no instructions for close observations on Miss Green.

The coroner said after receiving a low haemoglobin reading he ‘should have been pushing every panic button available’.

Blood was ready to collect at 11.55pm but was not picked up until 1.10am the next day and the transfusion only started at 1.25am.

‘Even then she was left by herself and without any care as she was found alone and fitting at 1.35am,’ said the coroner.

Miss Green then went into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save her life.

‘Had a blood transfusion been started as soon as possible after the bloods were available Andrea Green would have lived,’ the coroner said.

Administrator Miss Green, of Carlton, Barnsley, who had two degrees and was studying for a third in engineering, suffered back pain which often left her bedridden.

She was told if she did not have an operation on a prolapsed disc the pain could return. She opted for surgery but Mr Ismaiel got the wrong disc, pierced it and ruptured an artery which went unnoticed and she began bleeding.

Ms Kelly outlined a catalogue of errors which had been made during her treatment.

She said it was ‘wholly unclear’ why Mr Ismaiel did not refer Miss Green for physiotherapy rather than have an operation as surgery was ‘not inevitable’ in her case.

The surgeon did damage the artery during the operation with an instrument but it was not clear how it was caused.

Although Miss Green’s blood pressure dropped twice during the operation and in recovery this information was not passed on to nursing staff.

The nurses did not realise the significance of the haemoglobin reading and anaesthetist Dr David Kershaw failed to inform Mr Ishmaiel as he should have done.

A trainee nurse inserted a wrong entry in an early warning chart which could have alerted doctors to the situation and observations were not carried out as confusion reigned over who was responsible.

Handovers of staff were ‘wholly inadequate’, said the coroner, and nurses assumed Miss Green was a ‘routine’ patient.

Dr Taiwo was unaware of the low haemoglobin reading until he got the results of an earlier blood test.

Miss Green’s death came just weeks after consultants in the orthopaedic department warned management of the ‘grave risks’ to patient safety because of staffing levels.

But the coroner ruled that the breakdown in relations had no effect on the care given to Miss Green.

‘The errors which led to Andrea Green’s death arose because of personal errors and not as a result of any systems failure,’ she said.

Deficiencies in her care had been investigated by the hospital trust and ‘significant and effective’ changes had been put in place.

The coroner said she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any of the many errors identified contributed to the death.

‘I cannot find that the actions of any of the clinicians was so bad that it amounted to a criminal act or omission deserving of punishment,’ she said.

Miss Green’s family have already settled out of court with the hospital’s trust for a six-figure sum for medical negligence.

Afterwards, Andrew Harrison, head of medical negligence at Raleys Solicitors of Barnsley said: ‘We would expect the General Medical Council to look at this case further to ensure no one else has to go through an ordeal like this.

‘It was extremely difficult for the Green family to hear the number of failures which led to Andrea’s death but hopefully important lessons have been learned.’

A Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman apologised to the family for the ‘deficiencies in care’ which contributed to Miss Green’s death.

‘The trust has sought to learn appropriate lessons to ensure that such a tragic event never happens again,’ he said.
