Andy Bellis (pictured), himself a singer in a band, was among those who were refused entry to a Vaccines gig for not knowing the lead singer's name

Music fans were refused entry to a concert by police if they could not name the lead singer of the band they were seeing, it emerged yesterday.

Ticketholders queuing to see indie rockers The Vaccines were quizzed by private security staff and a police officer after a tip-off that pickpockets were preparing to target the show.

Fans were asked to name the band, the lead singer and titles of their albums, before being allowed into the venue in Llandudno, north Wales.

But six people were unable to answer some of the questions, so had their £18.50 tickets confiscated and were refused admission. Another two were ejected once inside the building.

Among them was Andy Bellis, who accused the police and venue bosses of being ‘heavy-handed’.

Mr Bellis, a university student from Wrexham who went to the gig with friends, said: ‘You can’t just go ejecting random people from queues just for not knowing information on band discography.

'I haven’t even had an apology.’

Mr Bellis, who is the lead singer of local band The Uninvited, said: ‘I got to the door with my tickets and we were pulled aside by security who asked us, “Do you know the name of the band you’re seeing tonight?”.

‘We said “The Vaccines”, and he asked us if we could name their lead singer.

'I couldn’t think of his name off the top of my head and then he asked us to name their albums and I didn’t know them either.

'I felt a bit intimidated and under pressure. That’s when he said, “You’re not allowed in then”.

Mr Bellis, 32, said he had contacted Venue Cymru for an explanation and refund but was yet to receive a reply

Come Of Age is one of the albums by the indie rockers, which police expected fans to know

‘I thought they were joking at first as I’ve never heard of anything like this in my life.’

The band’s lead singer is Justin Young and their albums are What Did You Expect From The Vaccines? and Come Of Age.

Mr Bellis, 32, said he had contacted Venue Cymru for an explanation and refund but was yet to receive a reply.

Manager Sarah Ecob said an operation was launched after they received intelligence about pickpockets preparing to target the event and confirmed one police officer was at the venue.

‘I apologise to Mr Bellis,’ she said. ‘We will be refunding the ticket money to him.’

North Wales police said there were no reports of thefts at the concert and no arrests were made.

The theatre also came under fire from the mother of diabetic college student Kiera Evans.

The 17-year-old was forced to hand over a bag containing insulin before being allowed into Monday’s gig, and Kenndra Evans said her daughter’s life was put in danger.
