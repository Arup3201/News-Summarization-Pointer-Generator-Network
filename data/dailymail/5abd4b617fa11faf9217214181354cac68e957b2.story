Raid: Mr Inkley stands by the evidence of the burglary on his cricket club pavilion, where raider forced open steel doors and ransacked cupboards

When Mike Inkley discovered burglars had ransacked the pavilion at his cricket club, he immediately rang the police.

But he was shocked to be put through to a call centre and be told that officers would not come out to a ‘non-residential burglary’.

Instead, he was told, it could take up to two days before police could take the details of the crime – in a ‘telephone appointment’. To add to his anger, he was told not to go inside the pavilion and check if anything had been stolen until a scenes-of-crime officer had been dispatched, a process which could take up to 24 hours.

The response, from a force which has 
been told it needs to make savings of over £40million, will add to fears
that property crime is increasingly being treated as a low priority.

In
the end, after the 50-year-old had told the call centre worker the 
response was unacceptable, officers were dispatched to the ground a few 
hours later.

Yesterday Mr Inkley said the call centre system risked undermining public faith in the police.

‘We
want an officer to come round and tell us it’s all right and everything
is under control – not speak to someone from a call centre 30 miles 
away.

‘It just lowers your confidence in what they do.’

The
company director was walking his dog at Walton-le-Dale cricket club in 
Preston, where he is chairman, when he discovered steel doors had been 
forced open and cupboards ransacked.

He
rang the new non-emergency 101 number from his mobile phone and was 
informed the force did not send officers out immediately for 
non-domestic burglaries.

He was told he could make a witness statement to the ‘telephone investigation unit’ in the next couple of days, and to keep out of the pavilion until a forensics officer had inspected it. After a member of staff from the call centre rang back, he insisted that someone was dispatched.

Thieves who broke in to Walton-le-Dare cricket club were said to have been looking for keys to the club's lawnmowers

A scenes-of-crime officer duly arrived four hours after he reported the crime and a police officer two hours later.

Yesterday Mr Inkley described the policy of sending an officer out only if one was demanded as ‘lunacy’.

‘It just means criminals will continue doing those sorts of burglaries because they know they will never get caught.’

The thieves who broke in last week are thought to have been searching for keys to the club’s lawnmowers.

In the end they left empty-handed, though not before causing £200 worth of damage.

Let down: Mr Inkley said the experience with police left him feeling as if they were 'call centre cops'

Rachel Baines, chairman of the Lancashire Police Federation, said she sympathised with Mr Inkley.

‘Whatever the incident is, people want to see a police officer and I totally understand that,’ she said.

Lancashire Police said the telephone investigation unit had been introduced last November to resolve ‘less serious’ crimes more quickly.

A spokesman said the employee had been wrong to tell Mr Inkley that it would not be possible to send an officer immediately.

‘If a victim of crime wants us to deploy to the scene then we will,’ he said. ‘We are investigating this burglary.’

He added that the call centre worker who told Mr Inkley an officer would not be available has subsequently been ‘spoken to’.
