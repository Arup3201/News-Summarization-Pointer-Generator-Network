Gareth Bale showed off his skills in his Instagram account as the Real Madrid forward posted a video of him scoring through a basketball hoop with his feet.

The Welshman is seen juggling the ball with his feet before side-footing it into the air and through the hoop.

Bale was obviously inspired by the NBA as he posted the video on his account with the caption: 'Just saw the game in London. Always thought it was easier with my feet!!'

Bale had also posted a photograph of him brushing up on his Spanish after revealing he was fluent in Spanish swear words in November.

The former Tottenham winger played in Madrid's 2-2 draw with rivals Atletico Madrid on Thursday evening, which saw the European champions knocked out of the Copa del Rey after losing 4-2 on aggregate.

Real Madrid currently sit top the La Liga table by one point ahead of Barcelona, and they head to the Coliseum Alfonso Perez to face Getafe on Sunday.
