A former IRA negotiator has appeared in court charged with aiding and abetting the murder of mother-of-ten Jean McConville in 1972.

Ivor Bell, 77, was remanded in custody after being refused bail at Belfast magistrates court. He is also accused of IRA membership.

The murder of Mrs McConville remains the most famous of the 'disappeared' during the conflict.

At the age of 37, she was taken from her home in Belfast in December 1972 soon after being seen tending a wounded British soldier.

Wrongly accused of being an informer, she was shot dead. Her body was found 31 years later.

She was one of 16 people buried secretly across Ireland by a gang called The Unknowns for the same charge.

An investigation carried out by the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman years later found that she was not an informer.

Charged: Ivor Bell, 77, was remanded in custody after being refused bail at Belfast Magistrate's Court

Mrs McConville's daughter Helen McKendry told the Sunday Times she believes Gerry Adams was involved in the case.

'I hope this goes all the way up to the top. All the way up to Gerry Adams.

'There are more people who need to be in this court to answer what hapened to my mother,' she said outside court.

Two former IRA members since have accused Adams, a senior Belfast IRA figure in 1972, of ordering McConville's execution. Adams denies any involvement.

The full trial against Bell will commence on April 11.
