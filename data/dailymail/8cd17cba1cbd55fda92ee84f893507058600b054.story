A tongue-in-cheek video welcoming the G20 international delegates to Brisbane makes fun of the Queensland host city's unused infrastructure, elderly demographic and slow WiFi services to name but a few.

The hilarious parody, posted by Comedy group Collective Noun, opens with 'You might be looking out your hotel window wondering, "Is this it?" Yes.'

And then goes on to have a dig at the large percentage of retirees who have chose Brisbane as their home to see out their twilight years.

'But before you judge our town, we'd like to let you know that we're actually the number one choice for retirement of women 66 to 67 years of age with family in the area. Impressed? I thought so.'

'But before you judge our town, we'd like to let you know that we're actually the number one choice for retirement of women 66 to 67 years of age with family in the area. Impressed? I thought so.'

The city's infrastructure cops a beating with the Clem 7 motorway - 'named after how many cars have used it'.

The $3.2billion tolled bypass tunnel that runs under the Brisbane river, was suggested as 'somewhere nice and quiet' to hold a business meeting. 

The adventurous types can always tackle Brisbane's iconic Storey Bridge: 'it's the second-best bridge climb in the country, of both available.' - the other being, of course, one of Australia's most famous landmarks - the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

Fun is also poked at the money spent on the bikes available for people to use to get around the city.

'Although they are four years old, they've been kept in such great condition. Look at this one, it looks like it's never been used before!' one comedian says. 

'Over the years Brisbane has played host to long list of world events' as this graph clearly illustrates

Delegates are then told to utilise the world class internet speeds labelling the network as 'some of the best in the world' as the video starts to drops out of range.

The most hysterical part of the two-minute skit is when one comedian points out that 'over the years Brisbane has played host to long list of world events' as a graph shows that since the city's declaration in 1902 - the only world event it has hosted is Expo 88 which occurred in 1988.

The video appropriately ends with a line that sums up the whole point of making the video:

'We hope you enjoy your time in Brisbane - we maybe a small city ... thank you.'
