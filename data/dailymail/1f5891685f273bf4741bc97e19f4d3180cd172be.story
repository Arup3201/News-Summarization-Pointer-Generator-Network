 A video of a burly bearded man impersonating a teenage girl has gone viral.

The unidentified mimic, who appears to be a tour bus conductor in the U.S., is filmed in a brief clip making a pitch-perfect impersonation of a girl.

Proving that looks can be deceiving, after some prompting the man is persuaded by friends to show off his 'super excited' voice.

Uncanny: The tour bus driver, who seems to identify himself as Matt, switches to a pitch-perfect impersonation of a girl

Appearing to reel out a well-practised persona, he switches tone dramatically, pretending to be a young female thespian regaling her audience with a backstage anecdote from a Shakespeare play.

The uncanny switch is made in seconds, and the man gets into character by gesticulating excitedly as he tumbles over his words.

Teasingly the man, who seems to identify himself as Matt, explains in character how he was asked to perform the very 'girl voice' which the video shows off.

The clip has racked up more than 250,000 hits on YouTube.
