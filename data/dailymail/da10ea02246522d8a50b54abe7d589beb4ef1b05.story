A London designer believes hybrid organs could one day be created using cells from body parts and even different species that have the potential to help prolong human life.

The project aims to create 'circumventive organs' that could help alleviate heart attacks, strokes and the effects of cystic fibrosis.

Currently, the organs are merely moulded silicon sculptures designed to look as life-like as possible but could one day become a reality thanks to the concept of bioprinting.

Agatha Haines' sculptures aim to be rooted in science and reality as much as possible and are designed to make people think about what sort of man-made organs they would accept into their bodies.

The organs utilise the idea of replicating and printing cells in complex structures.

The technology could mean different cells with various functions could be put together in new ways to create new organs we would take millions of years to evolve naturally - if at all.

If the organ pictured were real, it would contain cells from the saliva gland of a leech. The organ would release an anticoagulant when it feels the pressure of a potential blood clot in the brain as a way of avoiding a stroke

The 'Frankenstein-esque hybrid organs' could then be put together using cells from different body parts or even different species.

The first is a defibrillating organ using parts from an electric eel.

It is designed to be able to discharge in order to release an electric current to the heart when it recognises it going into fibrillation or heart attack.

Ms Haines also created a realistic model of an organ that uses rattlesnake muscles to release mucus from the respiratory system of a person who suffers from cystic fibrosis.

The mucus would be dispelled through the stomach if the model became a reality.

Another organ contains cells from the saliva gland of a leech.

The organ would release an anticoagulant 
when it feels the pressure of a potential blood clot in the brain as a 
way of avoiding a stroke.

Ms Haines, the designer behind the gruesome models, said she is interested in whether people are likely to accept these organs

Ms Haines said: 'Whether people are more likely to accept these organs is something that I am trying to question through doing the project.

'I have been interested in how people respond and relate to new body parts, whether it is a transplant or a prosthetic and how sometimes it takes a while to accept this new part as initially it feels alien to the body.'

She believes that if the organs can be 
partially created from cells from different parts of the human body, 
individuals might be more likely to accept them into their bodies.

The designer mocked-up what it might be like to have the 'electrostabilis cardium' organ fitted and made a model of cutting through a realistic sternum

Ms Haines said: 'I researched how these cells and tissues exist and look in humans and other species already and how they might look when they are joined to things they aren't usually attached to.

'I then tried to design the shapes they are in based on the functions they have to perform.

I also spent a long time testing colours that could give a sense of what the organ does, so I hoped the form might be slightly descriptive of the function.'

The models are life-size to show how much space they may take up when inside the human body.
