A P-plate driver who was filmed repeatedly swearing at a police officer and taunting him over his weight will be slapped with more than $700 in fines after footage of his encounter was uploaded to social media.

The man, believed to be in his early 20s, was pulled over by an officer in Sydney on Saturday for driving without his P-plates.

He was filmed calling the officer a 'f***ing useless piece of s**t' before uploading the video to Facebook where it has been viewed almost 80,000 times.

NSW Police have since confirmed the man will receive two fines - one for driving without P-plates and another for offensive language - after Daily Mail Australia published footage of the encounter on Monday.

The infringement notice for driving without P-plates is $242, while using offensive language comes with a $500 fine.

Two young men have filmed themselves repeatedly swearing at a police officer after they were fined for driving without p-plates in Sydney on Saturday

The driver was filmed verbally abusing the officer by a friend in the passenger seat after they were made to wait 15 minutes before they were handed a fine. 

The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before the two men unleashed a torrent of abuse.

'Four times you've been given tickets for not displaying p-plates,' the officer can be heard saying.

The driver hit back: 'What are you trying to prove? You want to know what I think of you. I think you're just a f***ing useless piece of s**t.'

'You're just bored.You're just a redneck that's bored.' 

Scott Weber, president of the Police Association of NSW, described the footage as 'disgusting' and said it showed 'a lack of regard to police officers and the job they do'.

'I think the offender needs to realise they have broken the law,' Mr Weber told Daily Mail Australia.

'Regardless of how minor he thinks these offences are it does not warrant behaviour that is offensive and does not meet community standards.

'If people want to drive on the road or to be part of society, they have to obey society's rules and laws.

'If they disagree with that, swearing or becoming aggressive is not the way to deal with the situation.'

The video shows the officer approaching the car to hand back the driver's license before he tells the driver this is the fourth time he has been pulled over for the same offence 

The p-plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to Facebook boasting about his brush with the law

The video shows the passenger chiming in accusing the officer of being 'racist' for pulling them over.

'You are a racist. Mate you done 180kms to catch me without p-plates. You're putting people in danger for a p-plate,' the driver said.

His friend ordered the officer to hand back the license before telling his to 'wake up to yourself'.

'You've done your job, now we're going. We've been waiting for 15 minutes for you to give us a fine for a P-plate,' he said.

The officer was filmed warning the driver not to drive like that again to avoid getting another fine before asking if the pair had any questions.

'Only question I have is that you need help... like Jenny Craig,' the driver said.

'Give yourself an upper cut.'

Mr Weber said situations like this could have easily escalated and it was part of a 'sad trend' where people had a lack of respect for police.

'If a person disobeys a police direction that can set in motion a chain of events which can lead to fines, an arrest or serious injury or even officers using their appointments – baton or firearm,' Mr Webers said.

'It can escalate very quickly.'

The driver called the officer a 'f***ing useless piece of s**t' but was allowed to drive away without a fine

The p-plate driver uploaded footage of the encounter to Facebook and it has since been viewed more than 60,000 times

'There are proper avenues to question police directions or behaviour. There are oversight bodies that govern police behaviour, or you can take the matter to court.

'It is a sad trend in society where people have a lack of respect for not only police, it occurs across the board with teachers, nurses, doctors and ambulance officers.'

Mr Weber said disrespectful behaviour was not confined to any age group.

'All people from an early age can question authority, but if you disagree or are told something you dislike or are instructed to do something you don't want to, it's not right to become violent or aggressive, or use offensive language, it's about having a conversation,' he said.
