Sonny Bill Williams scored twice on his All Blacks return as New Zealand thrashed the United States 74-6 in Chicago in a comfortable warm up before facing England at Twickenham next Saturday.

The All Blacks ran in 12 tries - through Nathan Harris, Cory Jane, Patrick Tuipulotu, Williams (two), Charles Piutau, Julian Savea (two), Joe Moody, Aaron Cruden, Israel Dagg and Sam Cane - with Cruden kicking four conversions and Dan Carter three.

Adam Siddall scored all of the United States points with two successul kicks from the penalty tee.

It was a comprehensive victory for New Zealand to kick off their autumn campaign and will fire a warning to Stuart Lancaster's England, who are their next opponents in London on November 8.

Harris, making his first start, got the All Blacks off the mark when he touched down in the third minute but fly-half Cruden missed both attempts at the conversion after a United States player broke early.

Siddall got the Eagles on the board from the penalty tee shortly after but Jane then raced up the right and crossed, with Cruden adding the extras as New Zealand quickly hit back.

Siddall scored his second penalty but the black tide was unstoppable again two minutes later when lock Tuipulotu crossed for a converted try as the visitors moved into a 19-6 lead.

A minute later the lead was extended further as Williams broke through after a great offload from outside centre Ryan Crotty.

It was a straight sprint to the line for the former rugby league star as the United States defence was too slow to react.

The game was rapidly becoming a rout as Williams passed out to wing Piutau, who touched down in the 26th minute for a score which Cruden failed to convert.

Williams then turned on the afterburners to scorch over for his second try of the match under the posts on the 30-minute mark.

Jane left the pitch with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Savea, who had an immediate impact and scored a try. Cruden missed the conversion but New Zealand were 43-6 ahead at the break.

Moody and Cruden both scored tries early in the second half before the latter was replaced by Carter from the bench.

Dagg, Cane and Savea all scored, with Carter adding all three conversions as New Zealand finished with a flourish.
