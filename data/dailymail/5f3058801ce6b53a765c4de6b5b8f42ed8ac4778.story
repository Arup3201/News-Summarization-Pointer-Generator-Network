He is trained to detect heroin, cocaine and marijuana.

But convicts in Vacaville Prison learned the hard way that Drako, a Belgian Melanois, has a keen sense for something slightly unexpected: cell phones.

Whether it is dismantled, fully intact, or submerged in peanut butter, the six-year-old canine seems to land on the device every time.

Star sniffer: Drako, a Belgian Melanois, has detected more than 1,000 phones in four years at Vacaville, CA

He once found 30 phones hidden in a microwave. 

Wardens at the all-male prison have no idea what it is that the once-abandoned sniffer dog smells in cell phones.

Officer Brian Pyle, who has worked with Drako for almost five years, told KPIX5: 'He'll alert on a cellphone, he'll alert on a Bluetooth, he's alerted on a laptop with a wireless card installed in it.

'What the actual chemical of it is, we don't know. 

'There's a lot of different theories...I know it's not just the battery and I know it's not just the phone. He can find a battery and he can find a phone. 

'Anything that's ever been attached to a cellphone, he can find it.' 

Top dog: The six-year-old canine was abandoned by his first trainer before officer Brian Pyle found him

Got it: Here he can be seen lunging for a pot of peanut butter hidden in a prison cell containing a phone

Federal law enforcement directors have branded cell phones one of the most serious contraband items behind bars in the country.

In 2011, a Mississippi prisoner was found to be running an identity theft program from his cell over the phone, and last year two murderers plotted their escape from a Florida prison via text.

There are just 30 U.S. dogs that are capable of sniffing out the devices.

Not fooled: He once found 30 cell phones hidden inside a microwave, which normally throws detectors off

Couldn't do without him: Cell phones are one of the most serious problems in California prisons

And Drako is thought to be one of the most successful since wardens started trialing the method.

He was snapped up by California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at the age of two after another training camp decided he wasn't good enough.

Abandoned and rapidly losing weight, he was given a lifeline when Officer Pyle took him in.
