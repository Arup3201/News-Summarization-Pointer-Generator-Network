Despite their best efforts, a 10-man Arsenal Under-21s side fell to a 3-2 defeat by Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Monday night.  

Gunners goalkeeper Deyan Iliev was sent off inside 15 minutes after he scythed down Boro's Harry Chapman in the box, having failed to clear George Dobson's back pass. 

Emmanuel Ledesma converted the resulting penalty past substitute stopper Matt Macey.

Alex Iwobi then equalised for Arsenal, netting his sixth goal in his last four games, but the hosts built up a two-goal lead before half-time through screamers from Lewis Maloney and Yanic Wildschut. 

Maloney's effort, a fine solo run, before a thunderbolt shot from long-range was matched by a similar quality strike from Wildschut, who can also boast two first-team goals this term as well. 

Daniel Crowley pulled one back for Arsenal on the hour mark but the fight back proved to be too little too late. 

Crowley had scored a last-minute winner in October in the campaign's reverse fixture, but on Monday, Boro were able to exact their revenge and consolidated their position at the top of the Barclays Under-21s Premier League Division Two. 

Arsenal, meanwhile, have lost their last two games in succession, failing to muster a response to the 1-0 defeat by Reading last week.
