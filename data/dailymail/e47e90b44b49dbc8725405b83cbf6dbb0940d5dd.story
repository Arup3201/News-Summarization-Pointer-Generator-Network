Paris Saint-Germain are continuing to show interest in Chelsea
defender Branislav Ivanovic.

The Serbian is looking to open talks over a new contract at
Stamford Bridge and is keen to stay but the wealthy French club are monitoring
developments.

Jose Mourinho is a big fan of Ivanovic and would not want to
let him go but the next contract is a crucial one for a player who turned 30
last month. His current deal has two years to run but early negotiations are
underway with Ivanovic seen as a key senior figure.

In-demand: Chelsea long-serving Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic is wanted by PSG

Chelsea will take decisions over the future of John Terry
and Frank Lampard over coming weeks as well as Ashley Cole.

It is understood Cole could trigger another year option if
he plays a set amount of games but that seems unlikely with Mourinho's current
team selection.

Terry and Lampard are expected to be offered one-year
options but Cole is ready to leave with Luke Shaw of Southampton expected to arrive in
the summer.

Otherwise it is a relatively young Chelsea squad and
Ivanovic will play a pivotal role in the dressing room for Mourinho over the coming
years.

PSG have made no secret of their admiration for Ivanovic but
realising his affection for Chelsea have also considered his team-mate David
Luiz, who is again figuring on the list of targets for Bayern Munich and
Barcelona.

Laurent Blanc wants players with European competition
experience to fit in alongside Thiago Silva with former Chelsea defender Alex
possibly moving on to AC Milan depending how his own contract talks go.

Chelsea rebuff loan interest in young Dutch star Ake

Leeds and Bolton are set to be disappointed in their pursuit
of Chelsea youngster Nathan Ake.

Burnley, Watford and Wigan all made enquiries in January and
were given a similar response with Chelsea keen to keep the 19-year-old at
Stamford Bridge.

Signed from Feyenoord in 2011, Ake was Chelsea's young
player of the year in 2013. He can play left-back, centre back or centre
midfield and Chelsea want the Dutch Under 21 international to qualify as a homegrown
player.

Leeds and Bolton are both interested in taking him on loan
but he is set to continue his development with Chelsea's U21s and first team
squad.

Coton links up with former City team-mate Rosler at Wigan

Former Manchester City and United goalkeeper Tony Coton has
linked up with Uwe Rosler as chief scout at Wigan Athletic.

Coton, 52, who also
played for Watford, Birmingham and Sunderland, had been scouting for QPR among
other clubs. He replaces John McGinlay who left Wigan on Thursday. Rosler is
also keen to bring in former Brentford coach Peter Farrell in a director of
football role.

Arsenal, meanwhile, have recruited former Tottenham scout Ian Broomfield who
was chief scout at QPR with Harry Redknapp, he will work
alongside Steve Rowley.

Derry released by Gillingham

Pacey young striker Tom Derry has been released by
Gillingham to give him the maximum opportunity to find another club.

Derry, signed from Charlton, was told he can go by manager
Peter Taylor as he looks to shake-up his squad for next season.

Derry - who was brought to the club by previous manager
Martin Allen - has spent this season out on loan at Chelmsford City, where he
was twice voted player of the month, and Eastbourne Borough.

Derry, 19, has this week been offered a contract by
Eastbourne manager Tommy Widdrington until the end of the season, after his
loan came to an end. Former Southampton midfielder Widdrington has agreed to
allow Derry to trial for interested SkyBet League clubs too as part of the
deal.

Eastbourne are in play-off contention in seventh place in
the Skrill Conference South but have three games in hand on some of their
rivals.

Alonso keen to stay in England

Sunderland defender Marcos Alonso is keen on a permanent
return to England after impressing during his loan spell. The 23-year-old has
been a dependable figure under Gus Poyet since joining from Fiorentina in
December.

The Spaniard made just nine appearance for Fiorentina and despite the
attraction of Serie A is hoping his performances for Sunderland will lead to a
bid in the summer.

One problem though is it is understood that former
Sunderland sporting director Roberto di Fanti did not negotiate an option to
buy for the club so there is a risk his valuation will increase and that could
allow other interested Premier League sides to step in.

Fazio on Everton's radar

Everton scouts watched Federico Fazio of Sevilla again last week.

The 26-year-old helped guide Sevilla past NK Maribor in the Europa League on Thursday as he continues his impressive form. Liverpool have also watched Fazio who has long been on Arsenal's scouting list.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring in another centre-back with question marks remaining over Daniel Agger. Cardiff's Steven Caulker remains a possible option but much may hinge on whether Cardiff stay up.

Southampton monitoring Braga starlet Rafa

Southampton are continuing to monitor Sporting Braga midfielder Rafa. The 20-year-old, who has scored nine goals in 20 games, has a £20.6m release clause in his contract and has also been watched by Bayer Leverkusen and Sevilla. Leverkusen had a £4.1m offer for Rafa rejected in January.

 goalkeeper Connor Ripley, son of former Blackburn and Boro winger 
Stuart, is joining Swedish club Ostersunds FK on loan.

Tottenham are in advanced talks for Anderlecht midfield prospect Ismail Azzaoui.

The 16-year-old has already made his first team debut for the Belgian club and Anderlecht's youth officer Jean Kindermans told Het Laatste Niuws: 'We have heard that Spurs are interested in Azzaoui and it is the player's right to make a choice.

'We regret that he will leave us, but you cannot compare this loss with Adnan Januzaj's move to Manchester United a few years ago. When players get to 16, we offer them a development plan and later a financial plan. We will not change the way we work.'

Aston Villa are close to an agreement for Swedish teenager Moustafa Zeidan. The 15-year-old striker is at Högaborgs BK where he has already made his first team debut for Högaborgs and will join Villa at the end of the season.

His representative Hasan Cetinkaya told Sportbladet: 'He connects to Aston Villa in June after school is out. He will join their U18-U19 teams, even though he is 15 years old. He has visited the club and has got a
good picture. Aston Villa is the best academy in England. It is a very good
step for him.'

Arsenal have handed trials to Canadian teenager Caniggia Elva. The 17 year-old is at London Colney training with the club's youth team.
