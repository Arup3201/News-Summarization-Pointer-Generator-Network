A tornado touched down just north of Boston, the National Weather Service said Monday.

The tornado hit Revere, Massachusetts and was spawned by a powerful storm that moved through the Boston area shortly after 9 a.m.

Revere Deputy Fire Chief Mike Viviano says the fire department in that coastal city has received dozens of calls reporting partial building and roof collapses, and downed trees and power lines.

Viviano says there are no immediate reports of deaths of serious injuries. Another city official said many buildings sustained damage, including City Hall.

The weather service says a damage assessment is underway.

More storms may yet hit, the National Weather Service said Monday.

Â 'A few strong to severe storms capable of producing damaging winds will be possible this afternoon and evening from the coastal Carolinas extending west southwestward into the north central Gulf Coast states,' it said. 'Isolated strong to severe storms may also occur today over portions of New England.'

Parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida were indicated by the weather service to be at-risk, as were Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts.

Approximately 8.8million people may be affected by those storms, the agency said.
