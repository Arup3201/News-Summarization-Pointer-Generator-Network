A one-year-old baby boy drowned in just seven inches of bath water after his mother left the room for less than a minute, an inquest heard.

Leo Clark, who had just turned one, slipped underwater on his back and drowned when his mother briefly left the bathroom at their home in Chippenham, Wiltshire.

His horrified mother, Natasha Clark, returned to the bathroom to find the youngster submerged in the tub next to his older brother Jamie.

Tragic: Leo Clark was rushed to Royal United Hospital, in Bath after being found by his mother submerged underwater, but could not be revived

Natasha made frantic attempts to revive him and had her young son rushed to hospital, but he could not be saved.

A coroner yesterday cleared the devastated mother of any blame in Leo's death, saying it had been a 'tragic accident.'

An inquest into the one-year-old's death at Trowbridge Coroner's Court, heard that Natasha gave her two children a bath as part of their normal routine on July 16 last year.

She poured just 18.5cms of water into the tub for Jamie and Leo at around 6.30pm and sat down nearby to make a phone call to their father Darren Scrivens.

Leo's mother had briefly left the bathroom to phone the baby's father Darren Scrivens when tragedy struck

In a statement read to the court, Miss Clark, who did not attend the inquest, said: 'After finishing the phone call I went to get something out of the kitchen.

'I am not sure how long I was gone for, but it could not have been more than a minute. When I came back Leo was on his back under the water and not breathing.'

Desperate Natasha took Leo out of the bath and carried him down the hallway into the bedroom of her ground-floor flat.

She tried to call 999 but could not connect - but she managed to get through to her mother who called an ambulance.

Miss Clark started CPR on Leo until paramedics arrived and he was airlifted to the Royal United Hospital in Bath, Somerset.

But he could not be resuscitated and was declared dead at 9.42pm.

Wiltshire Police attended the flat, in Neeld (corr) Crescent, but decided there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

Sergeant Simon Garrett (corr), who attended the scene with PC Melony (corr) Neal, said: 'I went into the lounge where Natasha was sitting on the sofa.

'She was very upset and emotional about what had happened.

'From my time at the address there was nothing that made me believe there was anything suspicious about Leo's death. It was just a tragic accident.'

The inquest heard Leo had a history of breathing problems and had been airlifted to hospital with the condition just weeks before his death.

But the court was told the existing issues were not deemed to be contributory towards his death.

Dr David Singleton, assistant deputy coroner at Trowbridge Coroner's Court, recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Wednesday.

He said: 'The children were put in the bath at 6.30pm, prior to going to bed.

'Their mother gave evidence that she left the room for a minute or two and came back to see Leo on his back, under the water and not breathing.

'On the balance of probabilities I believe the appropriate verdict is one of accidental death.'
