Girls star Lena Dunham has splashed out more than $4.8 million on a sprawling new home after moving out of her modest $500,000 apartment.

The 28-year-old writer, actress and director has moved into the four-bedroom apartment with her longtime boyfriend, musician Jack Antonoff. 

Lena - who scored a reported $3.7 million book advance for her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl from publishers Random House - bought the property in her beloved Brooklyn.

Luxury: Lena Dunham has splashed out $4.8m on a condo in this new boutique building in Brooklyn 

Happy couple: Lena Dunham shares her new home with longtime love, Jack Antonoff

Home sweet home: Musician Jack Antonoff seen arriving home at the apartment he shares with Lena Dunham on Friday 

The brand new boutique condo building has just five apartments, each with their own elevator and top of the range appliances. 

It is a five-minute walk from New York harbor and Lena's apartment boasts stunning views of the lower Manhattan skyline from its giant terrace.

Aside from the terrace, there’s a spacious ground-floor courtyard complete with a fountain for all of the tenants.

Lena's new home is a far cry from the shabby apartment her Girls character, struggling writer, Hannah Horvath, is seen sharing with her boyfriend Adam, played by Adam Driver, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. 

The star bought her first home in Brooklyn Heights in 2012 and told how she had hankered to live in the building since she was a teenager, saying: 'I used to walk my dog by this apartment building in high school. I was always getting in trouble for my dog peeing in the courtyard, which is technically illegal. I’m like, ‘Someday, I’m going to live in that building!’' 

After Girls took off, Vogue reported that 'she moved in with a sense of private triumph.'

However, in an interview with the fashion bible in January, she said she would soon be moving out with Fun frontman Jack.

And Lena is most certainly moving up in the world after splashing out more than the original $4.750,000 asking price.

Records show that the purchase price in May was $4,887,600 and the property was brought through a trust. 

Although Lena has been away, Jack, 30 - who is working on his new solo project Bleachers - was seen arriving home on Friday with pals. 

Broody: Jack Antonoff says he's ready for kids - and the sprawling home he shares with Lena Dunham is more than big enough for a baby

The pair have said they are real homebodies, and Jack recently compared their relationship to that of a staid old couple.

'One time we were at a dinner party where everyone was over 60 and before we knew it we realized everyone at the table had gone outside to smoke pot and they didn’t invite us. That basically says it all,' he told New York magazine. 

The couple hit it off after going on a blind date two years ago, but Lena insists they won’t tie the knot until same-sex marriage is legal across America.

But turning one of their spare bedrooms into a nursery could be on the cards soon.

Jack, who co-wrote several tracks on Lena's close friend Taylor Swift’s new album 1989, admits he’s broody and can’t wait to have children, adding: It just seems like the most fun thing in the world.

'I think it is biological. I’m 30. I’m not that young right.'  

Advance: Lena Dunham got a reported $3.7 million advance for her memoir, Not That Kind Of Girl, from publishers Random House - allowing her to splash out on a new home

Lena has not put her old Brooklyn Heights apartment - described by Vogue as 'concertedly unostentatious' - up for sale.

The property has a small galley kitchen, featuring an old photo of Lena's grandmother as well as a hot-pink Hello Kitty microwave.

And nearby, Lena had arranged what she refered to as her 'salon wall', a small selection of artefacts, fan letters from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks; a birthday drawing from the New Yorker cartoonist and Girls producer Bruce Eric Kaplan; a portrait of Girls star Zosia Mamet by co-star Jemima Kirke; and other 'cherished works'. 

To really prove that art does mirror life, much of the furniture in the apartment, Vogue noted, was taken directly from the Girls set.

The Girls star has however found herself at the center of controversy as a result of her memoir.

The first incident was over the memoir's description of her relationship with her sister.

Right-wing website Truth Revolt excerpted a portion from the book about her childhood curiosity with the female reproductive system and labelled it 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'.

The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs.

In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers.

'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds.

Dunham wrote that she subsequently she 'spread open her vagina' as the two played on the driveway.

'She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked,' she wrote.

'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!”

'It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.'

Right-wing website Truth Revolt described the incident as 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'.

In response Dunham threatened to sue the website.

That was followed by further controversy over her claim that she was raped while at university by a man she identifies as 'Barry One', a 'mustachioed campus Republican'.

The man who fits that description has now retained an attorney and taken steps towards suing her, saying that he has asked since the book's publication for his name to be cleared.
