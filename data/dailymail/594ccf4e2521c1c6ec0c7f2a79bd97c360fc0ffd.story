It may sound like a lot of old carp, but the England fishing team are crying foul after suspected cheating led to Romania triumphing at a global fishing competition .

England's team of freshwater fishermen have launched a formal protest after they lost the 14th World Carp Angling Championships.

They have accused the hosts Romania of using 'special bait' to hook first place in the tournament.

Catch of the day: Questions have been raised about the competition. Pictured are Krisztian Peter (left) and Norbert Barati of Hungary competing in the championship

Unbeknown to the England team, Romania spent nearly five months using a particular recipe to feed the fish in Lake Corbu where the competition took place, The Independent reported.

Using boilies - a blend of flour, egg and flavouring - the dejected English team could only watch as the carp fell hook, line and sinker for the hosts bait, which they had eaten for weeks.

Ian Huntington, team manager of the Korda England Carp Team, told The Independent that the secretive method was against the spirit of fair play, but conceded that it was not actually cheating as it did not break any rules.

He said the team were deeply disappointed by the outcome of the competition.

'Hard lessons have been learnt and it
has been a very difficult experience to pick the team and ourselves up 
after this event,' he told the newspaper.

'Within two hours of the match starting we were asking ourselves questions about the bait.'

England were deeply disappointed when they learned that special bait was being used to lure all the carp and win the prizes

The carp were fed bait from boats tethered to the shore in Lake Corbu, months before the big championship

He said Romania would have a distinct advantage using bait that the fish had been previously fed with.

Sadly for the competitive team, other countries had heard about the plot and cunningly bought a supply of local bait.

They had learned of the plan when they practised on the lakes and had seen the bait tethered to boats, which had begun in May.

Romania dominated the event and took the Team Gold and the Individual. Bulgaria were runners-up and Serbia clinched third place after both countries used the particular type of bait.

The Angling Trust's international events manager Dick Clegg told The Independent that he would raise the issue at a meeting in November.

The tournament's Romanian organisers were unavailable to comment.
