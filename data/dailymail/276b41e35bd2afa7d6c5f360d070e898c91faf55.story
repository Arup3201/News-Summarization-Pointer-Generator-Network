A child is feared to have eaten part of another toddler's ear after a small part was torn off at a nursery.

Daniyaal Abubaker suffered an injury to his right lobe on his second day at Mucky Pups Day Nursery in Garretts Green Birmingham.

The boy, who will be two this weekend, needed 10 stitches and spent two nights in hospital following the incident.

His mother, Afsha, 26, said the family had been given different versions of events including the theory that he had been bitten by another child.

The missing part of his ear has not been found, sparking fears another toddler may have eaten it.

It is feared that another child may have eaten the ear as the missing part of the lobe has not been found

Mrs Abubaker, a carer, said: 'We still don't know what happened to our son to this day, but to see your son in terrible pain with part of his ear missing was just horrific.

'I couldn't stop crying. Daniyaal has been left traumatised.

'Sometimes when I move close to his face to kiss him he gets upset, he doesn't like anyone to go close to his ear. He has been scarred mentally, not just physically.'

Ofsted inspectors visited the nursery shortly after the incident and rated it as inadequate saying risk assessments were not 'rigorous enough', adding that the nursery did not 'address all safety issues'.

Mrs Abubaker said she received a call at around 11.30am on September 25 from nursery owner Paula Tidmus to say her son had injured his ear in a fall and that he 'might require stitches'.

She claims her sister-in-law Madiha Hamid phoned the nursery shortly afterwards, only to be told Daniyaal had been punched.

Mrs Abubaker claims another sister-in-law, Arooj Arooj, picked injured Daniyaal up from the nursery, where Mrs Tidmus told her that he had been 'bitten' by another child there.

Daniyaal was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where he had an operation on his ear the following day.

Mrs Abubaker said: 'I contacted police as I have heard different versions of events and don't know exactly what happened to my son that day.

Daniyaal had to spend two nights in hospital to be treated and he had 10 stitches put in his ear

Mucky Pups Day Nursery in Garretts Green, Birmingham, was rated as inadequate by Ofsted inspectors when they visited days after the incident

'When I spoke to Paula again, and asked her what had happened to the piece of ear, she said the child must have swallowed it.'

Owner of the nursery Paula Tidmus declined to comment adding that the case was being dealt with by her solicitors and insurers.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Specialist officers from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit are reviewing an incident, in which a young child suffered an injury to his ear.

'Officers are in the process of contacting the family and relevant agencies, including Children's Social Care, as part of the ongoing inquiry.'

Ofsted inspectors visited the nursery on October 2 and gave it a rating of 4 - ‘inadequate' and flagged up health and safety issues as an area of concern.

The report said: 'Risks assessments are not rigorous enough as they do not address all safety issues in the nursery and staff do not help children learn how to be safe during activities.'

The report said that if the nursery didn't make the necessary improvements, enforcement action would be taken. It will be inspected again within 12 months of the date of this inspection.
