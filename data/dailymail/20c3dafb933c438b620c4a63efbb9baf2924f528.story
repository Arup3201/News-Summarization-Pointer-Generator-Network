His last stunt saw him perform a tightrope walk across the French Alps.

But French thrill-seeker Tancrede Melet has now carried out an even more daring feat.

The 31-year-old adrenaline junkie has filmed himself leaping off a 3,400 meter-high peak in the Mont Blanc massif mountain range wearing a wing suit.

Filmed on a GoPro camera attached to a helmet, the incredible footage shows Mr Melet standing on a tiny platform at the top of the Aiguille de la Republique - the Needle of the Republique -11,200ft high in the air before bracing himself for the jump.

The Frenchman spent eight hours climbing the peak before making the journey down in around a mere three minutes.

After scaling the Aiguille de la Republique, a location that has never previously been jumped from before, the extreme athlete is then seen soaring through the air at speeds of up top to 100mph.

Kitted out with a state-of-the-art, made-to-measure wing suit, Mr Melet has made over 200 previous jumps. He performed his latest jump in September this year.

He said: ‘I was definitely scared, it was the first time somebody had jumped from this place and I climbed the needle entirely on my own.

‘Before I jump I try to clear my mind, take deep breaths and concentrate.

‘When you jump you feel as if you are flying, it is like being in a fast aircraft but it is your body that is travelling, you can feel the speed on your face.

‘The Mont Blanc mountain range is stunning, it is a crazy landscape.

‘I was not planning to fly all the way down to Chamonix but the more I flew, the closer is got, I couldn't believe I had made it so far down.

‘With that particular jump you have a glide ratio of 2.5 which means if you have 1000 metres of verticality, you fly 2,500 metres across the air.

It took Mr Melet three minutes to make the journey down from the top the Needles of the Republique. It is the first time that anyone has jumped off the top of the peak

‘There is a feeling of relief when you land but also of joy and happiness, when you realise it took about three minutes to fly down when it takes eight hours by feet, it is an extraordinary feeling.’

It was in June this year that Mr Melet was seen attempting the first-ever tightrope walk  - or highline walk -across a crevasse in Chamonix's famous Vallée Blanche.

A highline is a type of tightrope walk which is done on a slack line strung between two points.

The stunt was filmed as part of a series of videos for Nivea Men, who recruited Mr Melet to help promote their sensitive skin care range.

During filming above the Geant glacier, he is seen losing his balance and slipping, before managing to catch hold of the wire and dangle above the crevasse.

He is then shown turning himself upside down and hanging by his feet until he regains his composure.

In December 2013 he performed another walk 1,200ft above the Alps.

He was shown walking across a two-inch wide wire suspended between two cable cars in front of Mount Blanc.

The heartstopping walk across the 196ft gap was carried out to mark the tenth anniversary of the Paradaski ski area. 

The record of the longest highline walk is held by Jerry Misewski who completed a 704ft walk in America this October.

Mr Melet has also created a documentary called I Believe I Can Fly which details his amazing exploits on tightropes – or highlines - across the world.
