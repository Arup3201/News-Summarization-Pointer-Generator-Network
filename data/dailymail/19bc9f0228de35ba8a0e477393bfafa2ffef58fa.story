Blunder referee Anthony Taylor apologised to Jose Mourinho for failing to award a penalty when Cesc Fabregas was tripped at Southampton on Sunday.

It has emerged that Taylor, who instead booked Fabregas for diving in the 1-1 draw, said sorry to the Chelsea boss before both had left St Mary’s.

Mourinho claimed afterwards the official would be ‘ashamed’ of his decision and went on to say that a campaign had been started against his Chelsea players after the latest allegation that they are prone to cheating.

It is unusual for an official to offer his apologies to a manager so soon after a game, even though they are allowed to discuss decisions after a 30-minute ‘cooling-off period’.

Mourinho is clearly attempting to shield his players from criticism after a number of them were accused of diving in recent weeks.

Hull manager Steve Bruce claimed it was like watching Swan Lake when Gary Cahill appeared to take a dive during their defeat at Stamford Bridge.
