Greek archaeologists have come one step closer to solving the mystery of who is buried in a vast ancient tomb dating to Alexander the Great's era.

Skeletal remains have been found in and around a stone-lined cistern in the opulent 4th Century B.C. burial site in Amphipolis, north-east Greece.

The site is believed to be the largest ancient
tomb to have been discovered in Greece, and has spurred
speculation as to whether Alexander the Great or a member of
his family was buried there.

Solving a mystery: Archaeologists have found skeletal remains inside a  grave in the innermost chamber of  an ancient tomb in Amphipolis, north Greece. There has been great speculation in recent months whom the opulent burial belongs to

Alexander died in Babylonia, present day Iraq, but his burial site is not known, and Greece's culture ministry said today the opulence of the tomb indicates that a 'distinguished public figure' is buried there.

The skeletal remains are being examined for identification,
Greece's culture ministry said in a statement. 

The body had been placed in a wooden coffin, which
disintegrated over time. 

The skeletal remains were found both
inside and outside the rectangular stone-lined cist, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26 feet (eight metres) tall 

Iron and bronze nails as well as carved bone and glass decorations
from the coffin were also found scattered in the grave.

Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC.

He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC.

Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went.

His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat.

This led him to be known as Alexander the Great.

Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents.

This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East.

Alexander was buried in Egypt.

His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west.

The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. 

Archaeologists in
the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent
Macedonian and some have hoped it might have been built for Alexander the Great's mother or wife, while others think it belongs to a military man.

A statement from the Culture Ministry said: 'It is probably the monument of a dead person who became a
hero, meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that
time.

'The deceased was a prominent person,
since only this could explain the construction of this unique
burial complex.'

‘It is an extremely expensive construction, whose cost, clearly, is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen.'

Michalis Tiverios, a professor of archaeology at the University of Thessaloniki who has not been involved with the dig, said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb, which at about 49 ft (15 metres) long and 15 ft (4.5 metres) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country.

‘It's a very important find because it will help us learn the sex of the person buried there, and possibly their approximate age,’ he said.

Professor Tiverios believes one possible candidate would be Nearchos, one of Alexander's closest aides who led his fleet back from India to modern Iraq, and who grew up in Amphipolis.

The ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity.

‘Whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later,’ Professor Tiverios said.

Excavations at the site in northeastern Greece near the city
of Thessaloniki began in 2012. They captured global attention in
August when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb
guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall.

Since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of
coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of Persephone, the
daughter of Zeus, as well as two sculpted female figures also
known as Caryatids.

The tomb dates to 300-325 B.C. Alexander the
Great died in 323 B.C. after a military campaign through the
Middle East, Asia and northeast Asia.

Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki (shown on the map) was built for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325 BC

The second and third chambers, not pictured, have not yet been explored
