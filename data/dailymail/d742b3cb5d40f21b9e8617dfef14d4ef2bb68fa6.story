Ever turned up to meet a Tinder date and had to double take because your suitor looks nothing like their profile picture? You're not alone.

A new survey has revealed that a
third of online daters are disappointed when they meet up with their date, with 21 per cent describing them as ‘unrecognisable’.

That's a shame for the 48 per cent of Brits who have picked a dating partner purely on looks, only to endure an evening of boredom and awkward silences.

However, this doesn't come as much of a surprise when a 
quarter of Brits are using profile pictures that are over five years old.

And as for those natural selfies, all is not what it
 seems. Women take five attempts on average to achieve the 
‘perfect selfie’ for use on dating apps, and a quarter use Instagram 
filters to boost their beauty.

Their efforts may well be going to waste because 67 per cent of men consider selfies a ‘turn-off’ and are less likely to strike up a conversation when someone posts a selfie.

In a wider setting, 87 per cent have even gone as far as to block people from their social media feeds as they're bored of seeing incessant selfies.

However we’re not totally looks obsessed: 56 per cent of people would rather receive a compliment on their personality than on their looks, found the survey by LoveFlutter.

Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a Professor of Business Psychology at University College London, said: 'Dating has been trivialised by apps that focus too much on looks and too little on essential human qualities. Wit and personality can be sexier than looks and unlike looks determines long-term compatibility.'

Research Psychologist Dr Andrea Kallias agrees. 'With the obsession of the selfie and digital narcissism, more and more focus is being placed on looks alone,' she says.

'We all want an attractive partner, of course, but what we need is someone who is psychologically compatible.'

That's awkward! Nearly half of Brits pick a dating partner purely on looks, only to endure an evening of boredom and awkward silences when they don't turn out how they imagined
