A grieving son has claimed a hospital failing to wash his frail mother for a month and then signed her death certificate with the wrong date.

Frank Lynch, 65, has drawn up a list of damning complaints regarding the treatment of his mother, Phyllis Hutchings, at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. 

He said his mother, who had dementia, went for four weeks without having her hair washed or receiving a bath while she was on the ward. 

Phyllis Hutchings (pictured), who had dementia, allegedly went for four weeks without being washed at the Medway Maritime Hospital, in Kent 

The hospital has been in special measures after a series of damning Care Quality Commission reports. 

Last week, it was reported that the hospital's A&E department could be downgraded or even closed if urgent improvements are not made.

Mr Lynch said his mother, who served in the Women's Land Army, was not fed properly and was underweight and dehydrated when she died.

He said: 'If my mother had been treated correctly and with compassion, I am certain she would still be with us.

'To add insult to injury, after waiting two days for the doctor to sign the death certificate it was wrongly dated.'

Mrs Hutchings died aged 89 from bronchial pneumonia, heart disease and dementia on August 12. 

She had lived in a care home in Sittingbourne, before she was admitted to A&E on July 14 and on the same day, she was transferred to the general Will Adams ward.  

It was only days before her death  that she was moved to a specially designated ward for dementia patients.

Mr Lynch's wife, Sue, 55, a receptionist in a doctors' surgery, said: 'She was treated very well in A&E, but as soon as she was moved to the Will Adams ward it went downhill. 

'It was heartbreaking and degrading.

'Nobody seemed to know what was wrong with her and what her treatment should be.

'I know they are short-staffed but there should always be somebody in charge who knows what's going on.'

Medway NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said: 'We are fully aware of Mr Lynch's concerns around his mother's care during her stay at Medway Maritime Hospital.

'The concerns are being looked at with the individuals and teams involved in Mrs Hutchings' care and we will be arranging a meeting with Mr Lynch to discuss the matter in more detail.'
