The icy relations between Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston and the club's supporters intensified once more on Saturday after hundreds of supporters took to the streets to campaign against his bizarre management of the club. 

Blackpool have just 13 registered players with the beginning of the Championship season just one week away and they are still to sign a goalkeeper ahead of the opening fixture at Nottingham Forest next weekend.

For Saturday's 1-0 defeat at home to Burnley, manager Jose Riga's squad featured nine unnamed trialists, with two in the starting line-up.

Limited numbers: The teamsheet for Saturday's friendly shows Blackpool including nine trialists

Blackpool: Trialist, McMahon, Trialist, Perkins, Clarke, Daniels, Zenjov, Mellis, Delfouneso, Orlandi, Cywka.

Subs: Dunne, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Trialist, Waddington, Trialist, Telford, Trialist.

Burnley: Cisak; Lafferty, Long, Shackell, Reid; Wallace, Marney, Jones, Taylor; Barnes, Sordell.

Subs: Gilks, Trippier, Duff, Mee, Ings, O'Neill, Jutkiewicz, Hewitt, Arfield, Anderson, Gilchrist.

Goal: Sordell 68

Sportsmail understands that Elliot Parish, a 24-year-old from Bristol City, was on trial for Blackpool in goal while former Newcastle and Charlton midfielder Darren Ambrose was on the bench.

At one point, in the second half, Riga had eight trialists on the field.

The club's pre-season preparations are strewn in chaos and fans were protesting furiously outside Bloomfield Road on Saturday lunchtime, wearing 'Oyston Out' t-shirts and singing chants such as 'you greedy b***ard, get out of our club.'

Supporters are frustrated by the failure of the Oyston family to invest money into the club and the scattergun approach to the transfer market - leaving the squad grossly understocked - has caused widespread bemusement.

Many long-standing supporters are now refusing to hand their hard-earned money over to the Oyston family and the majority of protestors did not enter the stadium for the match following their demonstrations.

A member of staff at the ticket office told Sportsmail that just over 1,000 tickets had been sold for the game - including away supporters - as of Saturday morning.

Marvin Sordell, a summer signing from Bolton, scored the only goal in a comfortable 1-0 victory for Sean Dyche's Burnley, who face Celta Vigo at home on Tuesday evening.
