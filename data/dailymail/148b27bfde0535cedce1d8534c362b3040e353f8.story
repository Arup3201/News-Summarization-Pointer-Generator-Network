The wife of a conman accused of pretending to be in a coma for two years to avoid court has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

Helen Knight, 33, has been questioned by police investigating how her husband Alan, 48, claimed he was in a vegetative state and spent months saying he could not stand trial.

Mr Knight was jailed for four-and-a-half years after he conned more than £40,000 out of his dementia sufferer neighbour Ivor Richards, 86, after the pensioner was taken into a care home.

Arrested: Helen Knight and her husband Alan, pictured together, have been questioned by police over claims they perverted the course of justice by allegedly pretending he was in a coma to avoid his fraud trial

After he was arrested for fraud he said he suffered a massive neck injury, which he claimed had caused him to have seizures which left him in a comatose state.

His wife allegedly told police and doctors how she cared for her often-unconscious husband after he broke his neck while pulling down a garage door.  

But police found footage of him going on shopping trips and holidays with his family, the court heard, and he was later jailed for his neighbour fraud.

Jailed: Knight, who claims he broke his neck in his garage, is currently in prison but has been re-arrested and questioned by police

His wife Helen and Mr Knight, who is in prison, have now both been arrested by police investigating the coma con for allegedly perverting the course of justice.

Both were released on bail and a file of evidence is expected to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in the next fortnight.

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested a 48-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman from the Swansea area on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and money laundering offences.

'The pair are currently on police bail while an investigation continues.' 

Father-of-three Knight's trial heard he apparently tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic - and was even hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down.

Swansea Crown Court heard how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of the pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset.

He was caught on CCTV at the Severn bridge toll on the M4 as he travelled back from the south coast, the court heard.

Knight was also allegedly captured on CCTV in Tesco stores across the country after police traced the use of the family's loyalty club card.

Allegations: Police claim that this CCTV was taken at a time when Knight claimed that he was in a 'vegetative state'. The couple are understood to deny this

Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened.

Swansea Crown Court was told he had 'pulled the wool' over his GP's eyes but he was unable to fool doctors at the hospital.

While he was on 'observations' they spotted him eating, wiping his face and even writing.

Knight eventually arrived in court in a wheelchair and neck brace. He admitted theft and forgery charges and was jailed for four and a half years in November last year.

As he was sentenced, Judge Thomas told him: 'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics.

'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is nothing in like the condition he claims to be, and the conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non existent.'

The judge also ordered an investigation into his medical condition after the case was delayed for months.
