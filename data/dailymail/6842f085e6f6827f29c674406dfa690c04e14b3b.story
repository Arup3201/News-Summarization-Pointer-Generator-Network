Italy has threatened to send asylum-seekers across Europe without more help to stem the tide of arrivals from North Africa.

The threat comes after the sinking of trawler carrying hundreds of migrants off the southern Italian coast which left at least 17 dead.

Italian authorities have now detained two 
Tunisians suspected of smuggling migrants aboard the boat having arrested them on suspicion of murder.

Italy, with its southern most island, Lampedusa, just 70 km off the coast of Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking a new life in Europe.

So far this year more than 36,000 migrants have arrived by boat on Italy’s shores, with authorities warning the rate is even faster than the record number of 2011 during the Arab Spring.

Italian intelligence says that another 800,000 would-be migrants are on the African coastline ready to set sail.

Italy’s Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that, without more help, with sea patrols, Italy would defy EU rules obliging migrants to stay in the country where they land and allow them to travel on to northern Europe.

'We'll just let them go,' he said.

'Since migrants do not want to stay in Italy, they should have the opportunity to exercise their right of political asylum in the rest of Europe. Otherwise we transform Italy into the prison of political refugees.'

He said that Europe should intercept migrants in Libya, setting up camps and offering humanitarian aid to migrants, before they set sail for Europe.

He said: ‘The humanitarian reception must start in Africa. Europe must go there, put up tents and take care of migrants there.’

Migrant
 traffickers often mix with their passengers only to abandon them when 
accomplices in speedboats arrive to return the smugglers to base.

Survivors include two Eritrean children who lost their parents and siblings.

The minister’s threats follow menaces last weekend by Libya’s government to facilitate the passage of illegal immigrants to European shores.

Interior Minister Saleh Maziq said that Libya could not cope with the influx of migrants transiting through from sub Saharan Africa saying that ‘Europe must pay the price’.

Libya has descended into lawless chaos since the failure of the Arab Spring , powerless to stop the criminal gangs of human traffickers shipping thousands of migrants to Europe, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels.

After the tragic shipwreck that killed more than 300 off the island of Lampedusa last autumn, an EU wide sea patrol ‘from Malta to was planned, but has so far failed to materialis.

Italian intelligence says that another 800,000 would-be migrants are on the African coastline ready to set sail and the nation's Interior Minister has demanded help
