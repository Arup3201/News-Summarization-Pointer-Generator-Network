The daughter of a wealthy Fifa delegate who helped in the controversial decision to name Qatar and Russia future hosts of the World Cup received a £2million payment from a business associate of her father with Qatari links, it has been claimed.

Antonia Wigand Teixeira, the daughter of Brazil's Fifa representative Ricardo Teixeira, was paid the large sum of money in 2011.

It is not certain from whom the funds came, but it is thought that Sandro Rossell, the former president of Qatar-sponsored Barcelona football club, was behind the transfer.

Documents seen by the Daily Telegraph show that Miss Teixeira was given the money on June 22 2010, when she was 10 years old.

The payment is the latest in a series of financial revelations surrounding Fifa's decision to award the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022.

An investigation has been launched by Fifa into the bidding process, and is scrutinising the business dealings of several committee members.

A report by Michael Garcia, a chief investigator on Fifa's ethics committee, is expected to be delivered later this year.

The Qatari bid in particular has drawn criticism as the country does not have a strong footballing reputation, and temperatures are often as high as 40C, raising questions about the practically of hosting a football tournament there.

Mr Teixeira stepped down from the Fifa committee in 2012 - after the crucial decisions had been made.

Brazilian police have recently begun their own investigation into his activities. He has recently moved to Miami.

Those in charge of Qatar's World Cup efforts have denied that the payment was in exchange for Mr Teixeira's support - and say it has no relation to the bid. The Qatar bid's legal team has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Teixeira was a member of the Fifa executive committee for 22 years. He has also been embroiled in corruption scandals over allegations that he took bribes from a company which was given exclusive rights to market the World Cup.

Mr Rosell was president of Barcelona football club until January this year. He stepped down after a judge agreed to hear a case alleging that his misappropriated funds from a transfer deal.

Barcelona counts Qatar Airways - which is wholly owned by the Qatari government - as a major sponsor. They have pledged almost €100million to sponsor the club's shirts.

Neither Mr Teixeira nor Mr Rosell responded to questions from the Telegraph.
