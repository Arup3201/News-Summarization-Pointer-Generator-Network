Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been advised to give up cycling or face an accident by his recently retired doctor.

Dr Graeme Killer, who was also the former personal physician to the likes of Prime Ministers Paul Keating, John Howard and Kevin Rudd, told The Australian: ‘One day he’ll come off.’

Dr Killer made the stern warning after retiring on Christmas Eve.

He explained how his medical career, which has included serving for 23 years in the Royal Australia Airforce (RAAF) including overseas postings to Malaysia during the Vietnam War, has left him convinced that cycling is a dangerous sport not suited for Prime Ministers.

Dr Killer’s son, a keen cyclist, suffered an accident that left him needing a shoulder replacement after someone opened a car door into him.

However, one of Mr Abbott’s cycling friends told 3AW the PM faces ‘as many risks from kangaroos as we do from cars’ when they cycle around Canberra together.

Rejecting calls for Abbott to get off his bike, Stephen Hodge, Government Relations Manager for the Cycling Promotion Fund, added: ‘But in big cities like Melbourne you have to be careful.’

Mr Hodge said Mr Abbott had asked for his advice on the safety of cycling before.

The PM's fixation on sport is not just based on early-morning bike rides, he’s also an avid swimmer and runner.

He competed in the Great Australian Swim, famously emerging from the water in a pair of Speedos and has taken part in the 14k City to Surf fun run in Sydney amongst other endurance competitions.

In his younger years, while studying at Oxford University in England, the 57-year-old spent time in the boxing ring and competed in four amateur fights.

He also played rugby while studying politics and philosophy.

But when it came to cricket, the PM said his only ability on the field was sledging.

Speaking at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Thursday, the PM revealed: ‘I couldn't bat, I couldn't bowl, I couldn't field, but I could sledge, and I think I held my place in the team on this basis.’

Mr Abbott was talking about his time as the captain of Oxford’s Middle Common Room team at Queen’s College, as tensions between the Australian and Indian cricket teams boiled over this week.
