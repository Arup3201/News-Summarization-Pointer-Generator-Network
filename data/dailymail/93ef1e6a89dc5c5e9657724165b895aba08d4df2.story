Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi has insisted that Didier Drogba understands his role at the World Cup in Brazil, amid reports that he is unhappy with his place in the team.

The legendary striker - who is his country's leading scorer of all time with 65 goals in 102 appearances - had to settle for a place on the bench in their opening game against Japan, with Swansea forward Wilfried Bony being preferred.

It took until 62 minutes for Drogba to be introduced, but the game changed on his arrival, as the Elephants turned a one-goal deficit into a 2-1 lead within four minutes of him entering the field of play.

And Lamouchi has slammed speculation that the 36-year-old forward is unsettled, reiterating that he is happy in his position within the setup.

'I’m in charge of a group and not just of Drogba. I am in charge of the whole team,' Lamouchi said.

'He knows how important he is to the team and what his role is for Cote d’Ivoire.

'Obviously he’s disappointed if he’s not playing, but his attitude in training shows his dedication to the team.'

Ivory Coast will next face Colombia in Group C, with both teams knowing that a victory will see them through to the last 16 - which would be first time in the African side's history following group stage exits in their two previous attempts in 2006 and 2010.

'This match will be completely different than the one against Japan. They will play a different style compared to how Japan played,' added Lamouchi.

'We know that it will be a difficult game. We will have to win the battle in midfield. We have the tools to cope with their players in midfield.

'It is a crucial game, but it is not the end of the world if we lose. We have to focus on our own game. We will get the result we deserve.

'Colombia are a very strong attacking team, with players like Jackson Martinez on the bench. Even though [Radamel] Falcao is not here, they still have some great players.

They have amazing potential. We have to be more concentrated. Their place in the FIFA ranking's says it all.'
