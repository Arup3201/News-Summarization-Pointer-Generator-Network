It’s been just over two months since the debut of the Cronut, the donut-crossiant hybrid that caused an indomitable pastry craze throughout New York; but now Dominique Ansel Bakery is moving on.

The SoHo bakery unveiled its latest creation this morning, a new take on another American classic: the s’more.

'The vanilla ice cream center is coated with 
a crispy chocolate wafer,' chef and owner Dominique Ansel explained of the $7 Frozen S'more. 'Then the outside - a mixture between marshmallow and ice cream - is 
caramelized, with the ice cream still frozen inside'

The torched-to-order, square-shaped dessert is a gooey hybrid of homemade marshmallow and dondurma, a 
stretchy Turkish ice cream. 

'I was inspired by a trip to Istanbul,' said Mr Ansel. 'I had the chance to try dondurma, the texture is very 
chewy but it's still frozen. I wanted to make something similar.'

The recipe - with its crackling surface, soft and silky marshmallow inside, and core of vanilla ice cream covered in a layer of crunchy wafer - took a week to perfect.

But rather than serving the Frozen 
S'mores on a plate or in a cone, the chef wanted to come up something 
'fun' - an applewood-smoked 
skewer made from a willow branch.

'You can't taste it, but you can smell it. It reminds me of campfires when you toast marshmallows,' Mr Ansel explained. 'The Frozen S'mores are different, I wanted to give people a unique and special experience.

'They're all made-to-order, you have just a few minutes to eat it on the spot. So it's always fresh.'

After the success of the Cronut - which was quietly unveiled on
May 10 with a small batch of 50, and by May 13, had sold out of 200 by 
9.30am - the French chef said business is booming.

'We definitely increased business to meet the demands of customers, to serve them the best we can every morning,' he said.

But he has no plans to open another store, despite the hundreds of customers - including Martha Stewart - who continue to wait in line for hours for a chance to try the Cronut.

Pastry inventor: 'I think about creating new things every day, I 
never stop creating and coming up with ideas. I've always pushed myself 
to do something new' said Mr Ansel

SoHo gem: The bakery opened in New York in 
2011, and is located at 189 Spring Street 

'Any good business should expand and grow, but I want to take time and do things slowly, I want to keep the standard and quality high,' he said.

So what is the next big thing? 'This is the next big thing!' Mr Ansel laughed.

'I think about it every day though, I never stop creating and coming up with ideas. I've always pushed myself to do something new.'

Dominique Ansel Bakery's Frozen S'mores are $7 each. Fifty are made each day; today they sold out by 1pm.
