Artist Damien Hirst has ended his partnership with Larry Gagosian, the world's richest gallery owner, after it was revealed prices for his controversial works have plummeted.

Mr Gagosian, who owns a total of 12 art galleries including three in New York, two in London and others in Paris and Hong Kong, has represented Hirst for the past 17 years.

Mr Hirst is the world’s wealthiest artist, with a reported fortune of £215m while Gagosian’s turnover was estimated by Forbes magazine as $925m this year.

Prices for Hirst’s works, which include animal carcasses preserved in formaldehyde, spot paintings and medicine cabinet sculptures, have fallen sharply recently - down by 30 per cent since their 2008 peak. One in three of his pieces has failed to sell at all.

Mr Hirst’s company, Science Ltd, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Larry Gagosian and Damien have reached an amicable decision to part company'.

Mr Gagosian issued a statement, saying: 'It has been a great honour to work with Damien over the last 17 years culminating with the worldwide showing of the Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011 at all 11 Gagosian galleries this year . . . We wish him continued success for the future.'

Mr Hirst is to continue his relationship with the White Cube gallery, in London, which has also represented him.

In 2008, Mr Hirst bypassed both the Gagosian and the White Cube, to sell 218 works through auctioneers Sotheby's, reportedly raising £111m.

Hirst's most famous work is the 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' from 1991, a shark in formaldehyde, which sold for $12m in 2005.

Another controversial piece is 'For the Love of God', consisting of a real human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds.

It was put up for sale at £50m in 
2007 and acquired by a consortium which included Mr Hirst, his business 
manager Frank Dunphy and White Cube owner Jay Jopling.

Despite achieving only a grade E in his Art A-Level Mr Hirst was at the forefront of the Young British Artists (YBAs) movement.

Art dealer and collector Charles Saatchi was an early fan and offered Hirst a £50,000 commission to do whatever he liked, resulting in the famous shark in formaldehyde.

There was a setback when a fin fell off, the liquid went murky and the shark turned green and wrinkled. But his curators skinned it, got rid of the decomposing body and stretched the skin over a fibreglass mould and it was sold to an American collector for around $12 million.

Other works using formaldehyde include a dead cow and calf split in two and exhibited in separate glass containers and dead sheep.

A series of 'spin' paintings were criticised as childish with even Hirst himself admitting to having seen the technique demonstrated on Blue Peter.
