Worse off: A UK family with one worker and two children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with the international average of 26.1 per cent, according to an OECD study

Stay-at-home mothers have been hit hardest by new taxes imposed by the coalition, a damning new international study reveals.

The British taxman now takes more from single-earner families than most other countries, after launching extra raids on incomes since the 2010 election.

The average traditional UK family with one worker and two children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with 26.2 per cent in 2009, the year before the Coalition was elected.

The international average for such a family is 26.1 per cent, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The situation is even worse for British families with a stay-at-home mother which are classed by the OECD as well-paid – earning more than double the national average.

They pay 40.5 per cent of their earnings in tax, compared with an international average of 38.6 per cent.

The punishing tax inflicted on traditional families – as a result of a reduction in child benefit and changes to tax credits – contrasts with both single people and two-earner families which have benefited from cuts in the tax-free personal allowances and other changes.

According to the OECD both groups pay tax below the international average.

The research comes as Nick Clegg faces an angry backlash from stay-at-home mothers over his proposed changes to childcare benefits.

The findings will add to fears that the Coalition has developed policies which penalise families with stay-at-home mothers.

And it comes amid speculation that the Government is attempting to force women back to work in order to stimulate the economy.

Former barrister: Laura Perrins, with her one-year-old son Matthew, ambushed Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg on his weekly radio phone-in show, accusing ministers of viewing her role as ¿worthless¿

Coalition policies have seen ministers strip high-earning families of child benefit this year, a policy which many claim discriminates against households with a single breadwinner.

And a £1billion policy to help families with childcare costs is to be made available only to homes where both parents work.

Backlash: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg faces an angry backlash from stay-at-home mothers over his proposed changes to childcare benefits

Last week former barrister Laura Perrins, 32, who stopped work to care for her two children, ambushed Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg on his weekly radio phone-in show, accusing ministers of viewing her role as ‘worthless’.

The OECD studied the taxes on wages in its 32 member countries.

It studied four groups – single people earning the average wage, a single parent with two children earning two-thirds of the average, a one-earner couple with two children on the average wage, and a two-earner couple with two children.

The report compared tax paid in 2012 with figures from 2009 and 2000.

In Britain, it found that single parents had seen the biggest fall in tax from 15 per cent of their earnings in 2000 to 8.4 per cent in 2012, mainly because of tax credits.

The single person’s tax rate fell from 32.6 per cent to 32.3 per cent over the same period, while the two-earner couple’s tax rate fell from 28.3 per cent to 28 per cent. 

But while the single-earner couple’s tax rate fell from 27.8 per cent in 2000 to 26.2 per cent in 2009, it rose to 27.9 per cent in 2012.
