Skiers and resorts in the snow-starved French Alps have endured one of the worst starts to their season in recent memory, but it appears Mother Nature is poised to make up for it.

With the slopes void of snow and openings delayed thanks to unseasonably warm weather that has persisted throughout December, the region is set to be walloped by a severe blizzard this weekend.

Meteo France has issued weather alerts for the Northern Alps, which are expecting 24in of snow on Saturday and an additional 12in on Sunday, in addition to wind gusts of nearly 50mph.

Parts of the Vosges and Jura mountains could be blasted with as much as 30in after seeing a shortage of snow.

Less snow is likely in the Southern Alps, although the total amount could top out at nearly 12in.

While the powerful storm will likely create treacherous conditions, the sight of falling snow will bring a sigh of relief to frustrated resort operators and others whose livelihoods depend on traditional winter weather, and will no doubt bring delight to British skiers who are planning a winter getaway.

Families have shown up over the Christmas break to find the slopes bare. 

The blizzard will be followed by colder temperatures, meaning this weekend's snowfall will stick around and the ski season will finally get underway.

As the temperature dipped a few degrees below the freezing mark on Friday ski resorts switched on their snow-making machines after growing impatient with the weather.

The ski station in Les Gets, in the Northern Alps, turned on its snow cannon to fill in slopes which have been green since a November snowfall melted away.

Up until now the conditions have been unfavourable for artificial snow-making – even at altitude – as the temperature failed to drop to -4C, the ideal value.

In a ski report issued amid a mild Christmas, Meteo France said snow is non-existent or very low on all ranges up to 5,000ft and there is only a small amount of snow on ranges from 5,900ft to 6,500ft.

But the national weather service said such a lack of snow is not that unusual as it occurs roughly every five years.

High in the French Alps, particularly in the Savoie and Haute-Savoie regions, the latest values have made this season one of the ‘least snowy’ winters in 35 years following the warmest year on record in France.
