Michael Phelps could be allowed to compete at this year's world swimming championships.

USA Swimming banned the 18-time Olympic champion for six months following a second drink-driving offence in Baltimore last September.

That is due to run out in early April but Phelps' punishment also resulted in him being excluded from the US team for the world championships in Kazan.

Now Phelps is potentially in line for a reprieve, with USA Swimming executive director Chuck Wielgus telling ESPN.com: 'It's complicated, but there are ways in which it could happen. There's a pathway for things to be reconsidered - or considered.'
