A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition.

The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings

Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented.

Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. 

After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.'  

The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.'

There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas.

The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit.

The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers.

Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. 

JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. 

After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer.

Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary.

The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.
