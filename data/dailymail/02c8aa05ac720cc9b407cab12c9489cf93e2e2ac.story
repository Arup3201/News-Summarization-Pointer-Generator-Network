A grovelling John Kerry hugged and kissed French president Francois Hollande in a show of contrition after nobody important from the White House joined a solidarity march in the wake of the terror attack on Paris.

The Secretary of State even brought back-up for his visit in the form of singer James Taylor, who patched up the United States's oldest diplomatic relationship with a rendition of 'You've got a friend'.

Arriving at the presidential Elysée Palace, Kerry reached out his hands for Hollande, embraced him closely, then appeared to kiss him on the cheek in an awkward display for the cameras.

He later gave a message from the American people, delivered in almost-fluent French.

Close relationship: Secretary of State John Kerry leaned in to embrace French president Francois Hollande on a make-up visit after missing an enormous solidarity march last week

Hollande told Kerry the two countries must 'find together appropriate responses' to terror attacks

Together: John Kerry (right, with French President Francois Hollande) arrived in Paris this morning, more than a week after the first terror attack on the office's of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo

Hollande and Kerry made sure to present a very public display of togetherness during the visit, with this awkward hug outside of the Elysee Palace

''You've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on September 11 

Kerry told Hollande: 'I wanted to tell you personally of the horror and revulsion that all Americans felt at these cowardly and despicable attacks against innocent victims and fundamental values.'

But despite his best efforts, he stumbled when pronouncing 'dégoût' - the French word for revulsion. 

Kerry was not available to personally join Hollande and leaders from dozens of other Western nations last week when they marched in solidarity with the victims of an armed terrorist massacre.

The White House later admitted it was a mistake not to send a high-profile representative, and said Barack Obama would have liked to go to honor the deaths of staff at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

State Department officials denied that Kerry had apologized for American absence at the march - or that the current event was his way of saying sorry.

But French officials said he had already apologized in private.

Singer-songwriter James Taylor was Kerry's weapon of choice for the public make-up with the French, often lauded as the U.S.'s 'oldest ally'.

At an acoustic performance in Paris's city hall, Taylor strummed French national anthem La Marseillaise, then serenaded Kerry, Hollande and the mayor of Paris with his 1971 hit 'You've got a friend.'

America's absence has received widespread criticism, although Kerry has contended US officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities since the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack.

He said attacking the Obama administration was 'sort of quibbling a little bit' - despite the White House's backpedaling. 

'Our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched,' Kerry stated.

Kerry - who couldn't attend because of existing commitments - told a news conference on Thursday:  'I don't feel any other exigencies, other than continuation of our friendship and our responsibilities as good friends and the longest ally in our history, and that's why I am going.' 

But French foreign minister Laurent Fabius - who accompanied Kerry to view wreaths laid outside the Jewish supermarket targeted in last week's terror attacks - said today Kerry had 'apologised'.

While the two were getting close outside the Elysee Palace, one of Paris's main stations had to be evacuated after a bomb scare

The US Secretary of State certainly made good on his promise to give a 'big hug' to Paris during the visit

Twelve were killed in last Wednesday's brutal attack by brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi - who were angry at the satirical magazine's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed

Sunday's march, attended by leaders from across the world, was a show of unity with the magazine and a rally for free speech

Kerry also met with Hollande, who thanked Kerry for his country's support as the two undertook a very public show of togetherness outside the Elysee Palace. 

'You've been victims yourself of an exceptional terrorist attack on September 11. You know what it means for a country. ... We must find together appropriate responses,' Hollande said.

Meanwhile, just less than three miles away from the Elysee Paris, police had shut and evacuated Gare de L'Est train station after a bomb threat. 

The station, one of several main terminals in the French capital, serves cities in eastern Paris and countries to the east.

Kerry also visited the Charlie Hedbo offices in Paris, the funeral of its late editor, Stephane Charbonnier, was taking place some 17 miles away.

The funeral of Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier also took place this morning

His funeral is one of several taking place today, while more took place yesterday - including the funeral of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, 57

Crowds gathered in Pontoise, north of the French capital, where the cartoonist known as 'Charb' was honoured with speeches and music, including some provided by Irish bagpipes.

Two large screens were placed outside St Martin's Hall in Charb's home town, so people could watch what was happening.

The cartoonist Philippe Honore, 74, and Mustapha Ourrad, a 60 year-old Charlie Hebdo copy taker, were also set to be buried today.
