The FBI is on course to have a controversial face scanning system and database up and running by the summer.

New documents released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation reveal the system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day - and that it will have 52 million faces by 2015.

The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals.

The database, shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States, already has 7-8 million individuals loaded.

The Next Generation Identification (NGI) system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data.

NGI combines all these forms of data in each individual’s file, linking them to personal and biographic data like name, home address, ID number, immigration status, age, race, etc. This immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States.

However, the extent of the system has not been revealed until now.

'The records we received show that the face recognition component of NGI may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015,' the EFF's Jennifer Lynch said.

The latest documents also reveal that non-criminal photos will be included.

'One of our biggest concerns about NGI has been the fact that it will include non-criminal as well as criminal face images,' the EFF said.

'We now know that FBI projects that by 2015, the database will include 4.3 million images taken for non-criminal purposes.

The EFF received the records in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for information on Next Generation Identification (NGI).

The system builds on the FBI’s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data.

The database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States.

By 2012, NGI already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals, and by the middle of 2013, the size of the database increased to 16 million images.

The new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day.

Currently, if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check, your prints are sent to and stored by the FBI in its civil print database.

However, the FBI has never before collected a photograph along with those prints - but this is changing with NGI.

Now an employer could require you to provide a 'mug shot' photo along with your fingerprints.

If that’s the case, then the FBI will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data.

The new system also link criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases.

Every record—whether criminal or non—will have a “Universal Control Number” (UCN), and every search will be run against all records in the database.

'This means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime, if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check, your face image could be searched—and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect—just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file, sayd the EFF. 

It says the new system raises major privacy concerns.

The system builds on the FBI¿s legacy fingerprint database, which already contains well over 100 million individual records, and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data.

'NGI will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time.

'This means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check.

'Second, the FBI and Congress have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system, who can access the data, and how the data can be used.

'This is not how our system of justice was designed and should not be a system that Americans tacitly consent to move towards.'
