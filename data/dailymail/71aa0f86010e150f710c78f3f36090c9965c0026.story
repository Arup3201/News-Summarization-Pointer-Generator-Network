When Sarah Kam started getting labor pains, she decided to get in the car and head to the midwife's clinic.

Not forgetting what the 33-year-old went through with her second child Ezra last year, she covered the back seats in blankets, just in case.

But as they drove towards the Midwife's Place in Bellvue, Omaha, it became more apparent that history was going to repeat itself.

During the 25-minute journey to the clinic, their third child, Evelyn, was born in exactly the same spot as her older brother - on the I-80 exit ramp to 42nd street.

Last Thursday Mrs Kam and her software engineer husband Hugh, 49, thought they had left enough time to avoid having to pull over.

But during the 25-minute journey, the contractions became more intense, prompting the mother-of-three to shout: 'Oh no, it's happening again.

'Stop the car! Stop the car! The baby is coming,' she screamed.

Mr Kam thought they could make it to the nearby University of Nebraska medical center, but his wife shouted: 'You've got to catch her, or she's going to go on the floor.'

Her husband then leaned over in the SUV and grabbed the infant who was crying. He then handed her to his wife and wrapped the new-born in a blanket.

They then continued onto their intended destination, and Evelyn is said to be in good health.  

'I was kind of nervous,' Mr Kam told the Omaha World Herald, 'because I was driving, and I had to pay attention to her and see how she reacted, because the baby could pop out anytime.'

On February 15, 2013, Mrs Kam, went through an identical experience.

Throughout the day her labor pains had been sporadic, according to the paper, but then they started coming more frequently.

'We were like, oh, my word, we have to leave now,' she said. 

As they stopped on the stretch of road, nurses from the nearby hospital rushed out after Mr Kam in, saying that his wife had just given birth in their car. 

Their first child, Ethan, was born in a hospital. Now, after their second roadside delivery, what's their plan if there's a fourth child?

'If there is,' Mrs Kam said, 'Maybe we'll just go park there (at the Midwife's Place) a month early or something, or as soon as the first contraction hits.'

When he kids are older, the stay-at-home mother plans to go back to the spot and take a picture. 

Mr Kam told the paper: We wanted to avoid this happening again. But it not just happened, it happened in the same place... Lightning does strike twice in the same place

Birthplace: Evelyn Kam came into the world on the highway ramp between the I-80 and 42nd street on Thursday in Omaha, Nebraska
