Ed Miliband’s political guru has joked that Labour should ‘tax the dead’ to pay for long-term care – because they can’t vote.

Lord Glasman spoke out in favour of plans mooted by the party that would lead to everyone being charged up to 15 per cent of their estate to pay for rising care bills.

The academic, who was given a peerage by the Labour leader three years ago, said: ‘It’s good to tax the dead as they don’t vote’.

At the same conference, the party’s spokesman for civil society, Lisa Nandy, said she thought a compulsory levy on people’s estates was a ‘reasonable idea’.

The controversial comments were caught on tape in January at a conference organised by the Fabian Society think tank.

Lord Glasman, a close friend of Mr Miliband, has spoken out in favour of a compulsory levy. 

At the conference delegates were asked to vote on their favoured policies – and the levy was among the top five.

Also appearing at the meeting, Miss Nandy said she was ‘keen on this’, adding: ‘I think this is a reasonable idea.’

Plans for a compulsory levy on estates to pay for social care were mooted before the last election but was scrapped by Gordon Brown, pictured, because of its unpopularity

The plan for a compulsory levy on estates to pay for social care – dubbed a ‘death tax’ by critics – had been mooted before the last election but was scrapped by Gordon Brown because of its unpopularity.

Andy Burnham, the party’s health spokesman, has often said he would like to see such a levy. But Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, told LBC Radio yesterday: ‘It is not the policy of the Labour Party to have a tax on death.’

The Conservatives said a 15 per cent levy would lead to the average Briton paying £46,000. 

Tory backbench MP Bob Neill said Lord Glasman’s ‘incredibly distasteful’ remarks showed a lack of respect for taxpayers. 

‘Labour’s appetite for extra taxes and wasteful spending knows no bounds,’ he said.
