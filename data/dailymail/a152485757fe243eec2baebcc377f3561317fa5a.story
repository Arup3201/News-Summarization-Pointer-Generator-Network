A father-of-seven who had his penis cut off in an attack friends believe was a case of mistaken identity has treated himself to a full English on his release from hospital.

Kelvin 'Kelly' Hewitt, 40, was found covered in blood and searching for the severed organ at the side of the A66, near Middlesborough, at 4.50am on March 12.

After weeks of intense therapy, the construction worker was released from hospital yesterday.

One of the first things he did after being discharged was post the picture of the fry-up on his Facebook page, with the caption 'Get in'.

Friends and family of Mr Hewitt have written messages of support under the picture.

Jonathan Hewitt posted: 'Get it down you followed by a few bevies you deserve it'.

While Christopher Bracchi said: 'Now pal I'm glad ya on the mend hope all is well pal I'll see u for a pint sum time bud (sic).'

Despite being allowed home, Mr Hewitt still faces months of plastic surgery.

However, it is possible that he could make a recovery. Dr Raj Persad, a consultant urologist, told MailOnline that a new penis could be constructed even if the original tissue is lost.

He said: 'The best hope is that doctors have kept the tissue in a viable way so the penis can be reconnected. If the tissue is no longer viable, the options are limited.

'It may be possible to make a phallus – rather like that created in gender reassignment surgery.

'Here, tissue expanders can be used to create a flap of tissue that can be rolled into a phallus. The urethra would also have to be reconstructed.'

Police are still investigating the incident are are trying to piece together Mr Hewitt's movements in the 11 hours before he was found by the side of the A66.

It is believed he was attacked at a site often used by the traveller community, in South Bank, near Middlesbrough.

While the assault was originally reported as a revenge attack, speaking last week, a close friend of Mr Hewitt told The Daily Mirror he though the assailant had attacked the wrong man.

He said: '‘He has a big family in the area, and it has shocked everyone who knows him. He is no villain.

‘You wonder if he was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and whoever did this was looking for someone else. We can see no reason for anyone having a go at him like this.'

After the incident, he had to be placed in an induced coma at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesborough.

Once he was woken up, specially trained officers visited him to conduct interviews but, for the first several attempts, he was too traumatised to speak.

A 22-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident but was later released on police bail while inquiries into the attack continued.

Debbie Lewis, Mr Hewitt's ex-partner and mother of four of his children, previously said the family had been 'devastated' by the attack.

Her mother, Christine Mclachlan, 62, said relatives increasingly believe the attackers got the wrong man.
