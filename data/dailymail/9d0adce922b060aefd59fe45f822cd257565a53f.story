Two women accused of pummeling and kicking a 23-year-old woman who died after a fight outside a California nightclub have been convicted of felony manslaughter but acquitted on far more serious second-degree murder charges.

Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, had pleaded not guilty in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in the early morning hours of Jan. 18.

Several jurors cried openly as the verdicts were read on Thursday afternoon. The case had drawn enormous attention after Pham’s death, in part because the brawl that was captured by several bystanders on cellphone video that will provide key evidence in the case.

Superior Court jurors chose to convict the women of the lesser charge instead of second-degree murder, which carried a potential life sentence. Each now faces a sentence of up to 11 years in state prison.

‘I told (Brito), “You don't know this yet, but you won. One day when you get out, sooner rather than later, you'll realize you could have spent the rest of your life in jail,’” her attorney, Michael Molfetta, said after the hearing.

Molfetta said his client and Zavala never intended to kill anyone and should never have faced murder charges.

A forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head but said it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow or even a combination of blows caused the fatal brain bleeding.

Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month

During the trial, Etoi Davenport testified that Pham could have died as a result of being punched or kicked, or from hitting her head on the sidewalk. The pathologist said Pham received six major blows to the head.

Pham's stepbrother, Ken Nguyen, said the family was satisfied with the verdicts.

‘We feel for their families, too,’ Nguyen said of Brito and Zavala.

At a preliminary hearing, witnesses testified that Pham and her group of 11 friends were waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala and several of their friends were exiting. At some point, the groups bumped into each other.

One witness told authorities that Pham started swearing and threw the first punch. Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation.

Deputy District Attorney Troy Pino said Pham threw the first punch but the kicks to Pham were ‘cheap shots’ taken while she was not a threat.

Jurors were shown cellphone videos of the beating.

Molfetta told jurors that Pham started a fistfight with another woman, Emilia Calderon. He said it wasn't proven that his client - a friend of Calderon's - kicked Pham during scuffling involving several people.

Zavala's attorney, Kenneth Reed, argued that his client didn't kick Pham and that punches from other people might have killed her.

Video footage of the fight was played during Candace Brito and Vanesa Zavala's two week trial which reached a verdict on Thursday

During the two week trial, defense attorneys for the women had claimed it was newly-wed Pham who had thrown the first punch and their clients had acted in self-defense.

Brito’s attorney, Michael Molfetta, had told jurors that it was Pham’s own ‘poor decisions’ that had led to her death.

‘She didn’t deserve to die, but the fact is she died because she took umbrage over a bump,’ Molfetta said.

Zavala’s attorney had also said his 
client had been wrongly charged with murder and that she had a right to 
defend herself after being attacked by Pham.

Video of a brawl outside a Santa Ana nightclub that left a recent college graduate comatose was played repeatedly during the trial.

Senior Deputy District Attorney Troy Pino had said the two women deserve to be punished for Pham’s death.

At one 
point Zavala, who was pushed away from the fight, returned to the scrum 
and dealt a final blow to Pham before Pham fell to the pavement 
unconscious.

‘Let the criminal system do its job and find justice for the victim,’ Pino said.

During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head.

But she testified that it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow caused the fatal brain bleeding and swelling, or if it came from all the blows in combination.

Pham was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers

Just who started the fight was in dispute during the hearing, with various witnesses describing different scenarios.

Pham and her group of 11 friends were 
waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala, a woman 
identified as ‘Amelia’ and two men were exiting.

At some point, the groups bumped into each other.

Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her.

Zavala told police that Pham's first swing hit her and the fight began.

Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month.

She was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers.
