A Florida military contractor tried to hire hitmen to kill and rape his wife, her family and his infant son and fortified his home against a police raid with $1million in high-powered weapons and body armor, authorities say.

Jason Simione, the owner of Bulldog Tactical Equipment, was arrested Monday night after an El Salvadoran employee of his company told police in Broward County, Florida, Simione approached him multiple times about hiring violent gang assassins from his home country for $150,000, according to police.

Simione's employees and his estranged wife say he had become increasingly paranoid as a result of abusing steroids and had spiraled into a delusional fit, fueled by racism against blacks and Hispanics and his belief that the nation was descending into chaos, court documents allege. 

Police say he even went so far as to threaten President Barack Obama, saying that he should be murdered because he is a 'n*****.'

Arrested: Jason Simione, 39, is accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill his beautiful wife Megumi Simione, her family and his 9-month-old son

Simione is charged with abusing his son Jett. He also allegedly wanted to have the baby killed if he didn't gain custody of him

Police seized some 68 weapons and 70,000 rounds of ammunition from Simione's home in Dania Beach, Florida. They say he was a 'survivalist' who was preparing for the end of the world

Simione allegedly began to plot his wife's murder when she told him in July that she wanted a divorce

Authorities called Simione a 'survivalist,' who was preparing for the end of civilization. They seized 68 weapons from his house and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, along with what they allege were parts to build pipe bombs.

Simione, 39, bragged on Facebook just months ago that 'he had never been happier' after the birth of his baby Jett. He was married to a beautiful 28-year-old woman, Megumi 'May' Simione, whom he had met in Hawaii.

That all changed in July when Megumi Simione said she wanted a divorce and moved out.

Police say Jason Simione asked his El Salvadoran employee for help killing his estranged wife, her brother and her mother. If he didn't win custody of little Jett in the divorce, he wanted his baby killed, as well.

Simione allegedly added that if the hitmen raped his wife, he wouldn't mind.

He allegedly told the employee that he had already withdrawn the cash to pay for the executions.

When police raided Simione's house, they found so much hardware, they had to use a shopping cart to haul it away

Simione's divorce lawyer maintains that all of the weapons - including a .50-caliber sniper rifle made to stop cars - were owned legally. Simione runs a business that supplies pouches and slings to the military

A massive .50-caliber sniper rifle, seen here being fired by Simione's estranged wife, was taken from Simione's home. The weapon is so powerful, it can crack an engine block and stop a truck

The investigation began last week when Megumi Simione called police and reported that he had thrown the couple's baby against a table in a fit of rage, leaving the child with bruises and a cut on his head.

Simione's ex-wife, Tara Simione, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that Jason Simione - who is broad and muscular - might talk a tough, but he wouldn't hurt anyone.

She said Simione believed his estranged wife Megumi was planning to flee to her native Japan with her family and his son.

Megumi, and Simione's own employees, though, describe how

In an effort to protect himself from what he believed was the certain chaos that would engulf the United States, he stockpiled dozens of assault rifles, a massive .50-caliber rifle made to stop vehicles, and up to 70,000 rounds of ammunition.

Simione, seen in court at left, was arrested and ordered held on $5million bail. He was charged with three counts of soliciting first-degree murder, child abuse and threatening to use an explosive

Simione's estrange wife and his employees said he had become increasingly paranoid after he began to abuse steroids

Simione's ex-wife said he told her that he believed Megumi was planning to take the couple's child to her native Japan after the divorce

Police say Simione was also building a pipe bomb and had acquired many of the raw materials to assemble one. Court documents allege he also asked the El Salvadoran employee for advice on assembling the device - like gang members in his own country. 

He stashed many of the weapons around his house, along with SWAT-style body armor.

He had even built an armored 'kill room' off his bedroom where, according to police, he planned to make a stand and fight SWAT officers if they tried to arrest him at his home.

The attorney for Simione's company, Bulldog Tactical, told the Miami Herald that all of the weapons and armor that police seized are legal and that it's part of his business to own and regularly use military-style weapons.

His company supplies canvas slings, bandoliers and other accessories for holding weapons and ammunition to the military and law enforcement agencies.

Simione was a firefighter in his hometown of Hollywood, Florida, for several years, but never served in the military.

'It sounds all dramatic, but that’s ridiculous,' attorney Susan Brown told the newspaper. 'That’s like a jeweler having jewelry in the house or a lawyer having law books.'

A judge ordered him held on $5million bail.
