A Maine mother busted for driving 124 mph with her two children in the car in April has been sentenced to six months in jail - and police say she's now also facing a driving under the influence charge.

Cheryl Gilson, 26, of Cornish, was sentenced Monday in Portland District Court. She pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child, driving to endanger and driving more than 35 mph over the speed limit.

A state trooper stopped Gilson in Portland in April after clocking her driving 124 mph on the Maine Turnpike in Saco.

Authorities say her children - aged three and five - were in the car, along with three young men.

Jailed: Maine mother Cheryl Gilson, 26, was busted for driving 124 mph with her two children in the car in April and has now been sentenced to six months in jail

Child endangerment: Gilson had her two children - aged just five and three - not secured in car seats with her when she was caught speeding

Scene: The 26-year-old, who has an extensive driving record, was caught doing 124 mph on the Main Turnpike in Saco

The children were not secured in car seats, police said.

However, Scarborough police also charged Gilson with operating under the influence with a six-year-old girl in her car just three weeks ago - three months after her speeding arrest, but before the case went to court.

It's not clear whether the child was related to Gilson.

'It's seriously negligent,' state Trooper Roger Teachout told The Portland Press Herald.

'Those children were in serious jeopardy of being killed or seriously injured.'

Gilson was driving a 2009 Hyundai Sonata and started weaving and tailgating other vehicles, Teachout said.

The three men in the car all had suspended licenses.

Teachout told the Press Herald Gilson did not seem to understand why she was being arrested and declined to say where she was going.

On July 13, Gilson was charged with violating her conditions of bail, endangering the welfare of a child and operating under the influence.

She was pulled over after reports of 'erratic operation'.

Gilson has an extensive driving record that includes speeding, driving with a suspended license, driving under the influence, and being found at fault in two motor vehicle accidents.

Cheryl Gilson is now also facing a driving under the influence charge. She has been done for DUI before in 2006

Her license was suspended in 2006 and revoked in 2007.

Her right to drive was restored in 2010 and she had no violations through 2011.

Then in 2012, she was ticketed for driving 87 mph in a 65 mph zone.

Gilson has no criminal record except for the drunken driving charge, which occurred in 2006, according to the State Bureau of Identification.
