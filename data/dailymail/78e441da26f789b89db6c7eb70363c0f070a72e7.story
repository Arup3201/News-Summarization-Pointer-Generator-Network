A father died after diving head first into shallow water in front of his wife and children, an inquest has been told.

Stephen Fidler, 41, was at the beach with his family in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar when the accident happened.

An inquest heard how he and his two sons had been playing in the sea during a break at Doha when he decided to go for a dive.

The quantity surveyor climbed onto a landing board platform before plunging head first into the water.

But it was shallower than he had expected and he struck his head against the sea bed.

His wife Samantha told the inquest in Newport how she tried to save her husband - but he died on the beach.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner David Bowen said: 'This was a very traumatic experience for you and the boys.

'It has tragically deprived you and your sons of a brilliant father.'

Mr Fidler, originally from Pontypool, South Wales, had been working in Qatar as a quantity surveyor.

Newport Coroners' Court heard how he had the day off for a public holiday celebrating Sheikh Tamim coming to power.

Mr Fidler was rescued from the water following the accident in June last year before being given first aid treatment.

But he died at the scene after suffering a fractured cervical vertebrae and bruising to the skull.
