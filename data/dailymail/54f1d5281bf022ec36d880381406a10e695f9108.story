Chris Waddle is 'fed up' with England's mentality and player selection, as the former Three Lions winger lays into Roy Hodgson's side after their Uruguay defeat.

England are as good as out after losing both their Group D matches, with their latest loss coming courtesy of an unfit Luis Suarez.

The Liverpool striker scored twice to gift his side a 2-1 win, and Waddle feels England 'never ever learn' when it comes to the World Cup.

'I'm just fed up with talking about the same old problems,' said Waddle.

'The biggest problem is - when you think about it - the Premier League.

'They have a product which they sell around the world which is entertaining but it's doing our players no good whatsoever.

'This is a Premier League side basically we played. And it's supposed to be the best league in the world.

'And you're telling me all them Uruguayan players would get many teams in the world, apart from Suarez, who was only 75 per cent fit by the way?

'Cavani possibly? Apart from that, who else is there?

'And we go banging a drum about we've got this, we've got that. You know what makes the Premier League exciting?

'The players like Luis Suarez - the foreign players. We hype all our players up massive, as we always do. And we say we've got this, we've got that.

'Look at their back four. No disrespect. That kid who played centre-half, he's played two games for Atletico Madrid, he's not even had a cap. Still, they know how to win games.'

Hoddle's verdict: 'The biggest problem is - when you think about it - the Premier League'

And Waddle went on to say England are misguided in their Premier League top dogs approach.

'It's not about picking your star players, and he plays for Liverpool, he plays for Man United, it's about getting a balance of a side which is going to get you a result,' he added.

'And we never ever do.

'The media is to blame as much as anyone else, because when they drop somebody or they play somebody in a different position, we're on the case straight away.

'Other countries go "you know what? I've got good players but unfortunately so-and-so is going to sit on the bench tonight", and are we bothered? No.

'Until we get that way of thinking, how do you win football matches?

'You start from the back, then you get organised.

'And if you've got two or three creative players, you build a side around certain players.

'And that gets your side balanced. It's not about having the best 11 players you can find, and we never ever ever learn.'

England's final game of Group D is against Costa Rica on Tuesday.
