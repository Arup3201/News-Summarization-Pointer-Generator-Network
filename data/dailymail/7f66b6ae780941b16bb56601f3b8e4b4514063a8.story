The number of children in care has risen to a record level following the death of Baby P and a spate of child exploitation scandals, a watchdog reported yesterday.

The National Audit Office said the care system for children has not improved under the Coalition and called on the Department for Education, which is in charge of the system, ‘to break this pattern’.

Children are still shunted between foster and care homes, and many are sent to live many miles from their original homes.

They are a quarter as likely to get good school exam results as other children, and more than a third end up at the age of 19 without jobs or the hope of qualifications.

The NAO inquiry comes six years after the Baby P trial, which convicted the mother of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, her boyfriend and his brother for involvement in his death. 

Peter had been seen 60 times by Haringey social workers, NHS workers and police officers, none of whom acted to prevent his death.

Since then the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent and this year there were a record 68,840 living in children’s homes or with foster parents.

Flowers and tributes were left for Baby P on the second anniversary of his death - since he died the number of children taken into care by social workers has risen 15 per cent

But the NAO, which is responsible for examining Whitehall spending, said the Government ‘cannot demonstrate that it is meeting its objectives’ for children in care. 

‘The long-term consequences of such children not getting the right care are poorer outcomes for them and increased costs to taxpayers,’ it said.

The report said the £2.5 billion spending on the care system in 2012-13 was a three per cent rise in two years.

However, councils were under pressure ‘because of a rapid rise in children being taken into care, following the widely-reported abuse and death of Baby P in 2007, while many local authorities expect or are already experiencing a rise in referrals linked to child exploitation scandals’.

On average, it costs between £29,000 and £33,000 a year to place a child with foster parents, the method used to look after three quarters of the children in care. 

A place in a children’s home costs more than four times as much, between £131,000 and £135,000 a year on average.

It said that despite DfE efforts to bring more stability to the lives of children in care, more than one in ten move home more than three times in a year, and 34 per cent move home at least once.

More than a third of children in residential homes live more than 20 miles from their original home.

Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said too many children are not getting the right placements the first time. 

‘If their complex and challenging needs are not correctly assessed and tackled, the result is likely to be long-term detriment to the children themselves as well as cost to society,’ he said. ‘No progress has been made in the last four years.’
