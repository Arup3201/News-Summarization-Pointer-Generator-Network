Black Flag may seem like an act of desperation from Ubisoft, hoping to get the Assassin’s Creed franchise back on track, but this is the best Assassin’s Creed title to date and one of the finest releases we’ve seen in 2013.

Assassin’s Creed 4 is what Assassin’s Creed 3 should have been. Players aren’t hamstrung by a four hour prologue, nor are they tirelessly waiting for their character to find his groove. With blunderbuss in hand, Edward Kenway holds the player to rights from the game’s opening moments and holds off on pulling the trigger until the final credits roll.

Stunning: whether you play it on this generation of console or wait for the next, Black Flag looks great

Black Flag takes you back to the 17th Century where a pirate’s life seemed to be for everyone. As Edward Kenway, a native Welshman swabbing the decks and gulleys of a large privateer vessel, players will stumble upon the infamous Assassin’s order and suddenly embark on a whirlwind journey of fame and fortune.

Chartering his own vessel, Kenway can take to the Seven Seas with reckless abandon, whether it’s firing down navy fleets, pillaging resources, plundering gold or discovering hidden islands rich with opportunity.

By heading out on to the open seas, Assassin’s Creed 4 presents players with new opportunities. Rather than the vast, bustling cities we’ve been used to in the past, Black Flag offers smaller ports, each with unique, hidden secrets.

There are also Naval Contracts available with financial incentives attached.

Naval forts can be overrun and used to establish a foothold on the open waters. But to do so, you'll have to deal with challenging weather conditions and intimidating wildlife, such as sharks.

Fortunately, Kenway can always keep ship-shape with a series of improvements, such as fortifying the hull, increasing the number of sails and improving weapon competency.

Kenway can also rescue stranded sailors and invite them onboard to increase ship productivity. He can even force his crew to break out into a rendition of ‘Drunken Sailor’

Despite that, AC4 isn’t a radical departure. The game is still taking cues from its predecessors, managing to encompass the best bits of Connor’s adventure last year, such as tree-hop free-running, hunting, skinning and crafting, as well as familiar series staples from previous iterations, such as assassin contracts and challenges.

Best one yet: some were let down with AC3 but Black Flag is a stronger game in almost every single way

And, of course, it wouldn’t be Assassin’s Creed without denizens of collectibles to find. Whether you’re downloading emails and historical data from Abstergo or chasing Sea Shanties, moving marker stones for Mayan Keys or digging for buried treasure, Black Flag has an enormous sandbox environment to explore. The biggest in the series’ history.

But it’s the graphics in Black Flag that really make Kenway’s adventure stand out. Whether you’re walking along golden sands, swimming through the wavy, murky waters, or standing outside in the middle of a terrible thunderstorm, these supposedly dated systems ooze elegance that seems almost impossible from eight-year-old hardware. 

Ubisoft have confidently steered the stormy seas and put Assassin’s Creed back on track.

For the naysayers and doubters who claim the series has fatigued, Black Flag is an absolute pleasure to play; completely refreshing, exhilarating and infinitely rewarding.

However you choose to play, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag is a perfect swan-song for this generation of systems, and a faultless introduction for the next.

Absolute pleasure: some may think this is just another update, but there's so much more than meets the eye
