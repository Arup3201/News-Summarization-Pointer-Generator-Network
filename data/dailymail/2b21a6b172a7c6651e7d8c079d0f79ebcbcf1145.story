Oldham Athletic have handed caretaker manager Dean Holden the job for the rest of the season.

The League One club received more than 120 applicants for the role which was vacated by Lee Johnson when he joined rivals Barnsley on February 25.

They included the likes of ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso and one-time Chelsea defender Winston Bogarde.

However, New York-based chairman Simon Corney has decided to put his faith in former player Holden, 35, who has lost three and won one of his four matches in charge.

In the 20 days that have passed since Johnson's departure, injury-hit Oldham have dropped from ninth to 15th place in the table while Barnsley, who won 3-1 at Boundary Park on Saturday, have gone from 16th to sixth and a play-off position.

Former Oldham manager and current Sky Sports pundit Iain Dowie was the fans' favourite to replace Johnson however, no serious talks are understood to have been held with the ex-Crystal Palace boss.

Swinton-born Holden, a defender who played for a number of sides including Bolton, Peterborough and Walsall, will be in charge for Tuesday night's match against promotion-chasing MK Dons.

He will be assisted by head of youth Tony Philliskirk and first-team defender Adam Lockwood.

Holden expressed his delight at being offered the role.

'I'm delighted to accept the role manager of this fantastic football club until the end of the season,' he said.

'I'm also pleased Tony will be alongside me to add his experience and knowledge of the game as we progress forward.

'I now ask all supporters to get behind the club and players for the remaining 11 games of the season, including the game against MK Dons (Tuesday night).

'I firmly believe we have the capabilities of reaching the play-off places this season and with your support, which has been excellent all season, we feel we can reach our targets.'

Holden, who played for Oldham from 2002 untill 2005, said he was 'delighted' to accept the role of manager

Chief executive Neil Joy added that the search for a permanent manager would continue 'away from the spotlight.'

He added: 'Given the importance of the role, especially at this point in the club’s history, it is essential that no stone is left unturned in ensuring that the board appoints the person whom we believe will give us the best chance of achieving our goal of bringing Championship football to the town.'

Oldham currently lie eight points away from the relegation zone and seven points from the play-off positions.

Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, who lives in the town and is a regular at matches, was approached about the possibility of taking the job.

The 40-year-old, however, said the timing was not right although he did not rule out taking over at some point in the future.

Oldham, founder members of the Premier League, have been in the third tier of English football since 1997.
