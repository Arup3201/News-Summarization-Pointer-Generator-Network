A Baltimore Ravens cheerleader has been cleared to leave hospital and is recuperating at home following a freak accident during a game against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.

The unnamed woman was treated at the hospital for head, back and neck injuries after being taken off the field on a stretcher - having appeared to land on her neck when being dropped by team-mates during a stunt.

The teenager was thrown in the air during a routine at the Ravens' game at the M&T Bank Stadium. However, as she headed toward the ground, she was dropped by her team-mates and landed on her head and neck, witnesses said.
