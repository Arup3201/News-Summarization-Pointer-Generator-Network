Jose Mourinho has said that he could never manage Tottenham out of respect for Chelsea fans – even though their Capital One Cup final opponents attempted to recruit him when he left in 2007.

Mourinho was approached to join Spurs by current owner Daniel Levy when he left Chelsea ‘by mutual consent’ in September 2007 after falling out with the board of directors and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

But he could not accept Tottenham’s offer at that time as he had signed an agreement not manage in England for two years – and says that he would not have done so anyway because his attachment to Chelsea is so strong

Asked if he was approached in 2007 by Spurs, he said: ‘Yes. I couldn't go. I couldn't train in England for two years.’

According to Mourinho, Tottenham tried to offer Chelsea compensation to break the clause preventing him from England working in England but he also said: ‘I would not take the job because I love Chelsea supporters too much.’

Mourinho says that were he ever to leave Chelsea, he would prefer to stay in England rather than manager abroad again. ‘When I left the first time I had lots of countries to go to and lots of clubs to go to. In this moment when I leave I have another 19 clubs in the Premier League and 22 clubs in the Championship. So the options are not so much. 

'But I repeat I am in Mr Abramovich’s hands. Until he wants me to stay, I will stay – and that is what I want.’
