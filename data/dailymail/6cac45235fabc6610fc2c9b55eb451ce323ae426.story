Tim Peake wants wants the public to help name his 2015 mission to the International Space Station

If you look up at the sky on a clear night, you may see a tiny white light moving across the sky.

The light, often mistaken for a low aircraft, is in fact the International Space Station (ISS), hurtling around Earth at speeds of 17,500 miles per hour.

Next year, British astronaut Tim Peake will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the ISS – and he wants the public to help name his mission.

The journey will make him the first British astronaut to visit the International Space Station as well as the first official Brit in space.

The competition, open to all residents of Esa’s member states, follows a long-held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a European astronaut goes into orbit.

Previous mission names have included ‘Marco Polo’ for the Italian Astronaut Roberto Vittori and ‘Odissia’ for Belgian Frank de Winne.

Major Peake, 41, said: ‘The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly.

‘My six month stay onboard mankind's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting.

Before joining the Esa astronaut corps in 2009, Major Peake was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot.

He was assigned his mission in May 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of Expedition 46/47 to the orbital outpost.

He is following a long line of British explorers and scientists, from the North Pole and the Nile to the Himalayas and now to outer space.

;As a former test-pilot I believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible,' Major Peake said.

‘The scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging, covering areas such as medicine, human physiology, core science and material science.'

The winning entry needs to be short – ideally one or two words or an acronym - and will be incorporated into a logo.

Names that reflect an astronaut's nationality are encouraged, but they should also have a wider European flavour, and be easy to pronounce.

A team of linguists will also check a shortlist of entries to make sure that seemingly innocent entries are not rude in another European language.

Major Peak will then look at the remaining option to make the final choice.

An early favourite is ’Beagle 3' - a successor to ‘Beagle 2’, which was the name of the UK's unsuccessful attempt to put a probe on the surface of Mars.

Another suggestion is ‘Starman’, inspired by the song of that name by David Bowie.

Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: ‘Tim’s flight is a reminder of humanity’s desire to explore new frontiers – and of the role that Britain has played in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.

‘The naming competition is just one of many opportunities for young people to get involved in a mission that will shape the future of Britain’s space programme and inspire generations.’

The competition closes on 4 April 2014 and can be entered here.

Major Peake is due to go to the International Space Station towards the end of 2015 and will spend six months carrying out scientific experiments
