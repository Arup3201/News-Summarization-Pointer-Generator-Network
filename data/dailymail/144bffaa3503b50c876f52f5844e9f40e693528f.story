Wayne Rooney is concerned about Manchester United’s plan to install Louis van Gaal as manager, because of the Dutchman’s close relationship with Robin van Persie.

The United frontman is believed to be worried that the situation could revert to how it was during Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season in charge, when Van Persie became United’s first-choice striker.

Rooney was forced into a secondary role and nearly left the club, feeling he was being frozen out.

Worry: Wayne Rooney is concerned by Manchester United's plan to install Louis van Gaal as manager

Close: Van Gaal and Robin van Persie watched PSV take on Feyenoord together earlier this month

Concerned: Rooney fears he would have to play second fiddle to Van Persie if Van Gaal is appointed

The England striker’s fortunes were transformed during David Moyes brief reign as he has enjoyed a return to form and signed a new long-term contract worth £300,000-a-week.

He was set to be named captain for next season when Nemanja Vidic departs for Inter Milan in the summer.

But that is not guaranteed now Van Gaal is set to be the new boss. The 62-year-old named Van Persie as Holland skipper last summer and has even invited the United striker to join him on scouting trips to Dutch League games in recent weeks while he has been recuperating from a knee injury at home in the Netherlands.

Van Persie was missing for much of Moyes’s short tenure due to injury after being credited with tipping the balance in United’s favour when they reclaimed the Premier League title from Manchester City.

The Dutchman has not been the same force this season despite scoring 17 goals, including a hat-trick on his last appearance against Olympiacos a month ago when he suffered the knee injury that was set to rule him out for the rest of the season.

Closer: Van Gaal moved a step nearer to securing the United job after Carlo Ancelotti reached the Champions League final with Real Madrid on Tuesday night

It has been noted that Van Persie’s early return to training at Carrington has coincided with Moyes’s departure.

The
 striker is now in contention to play in United’s final three games as 
Ryan Giggs looks to promote his credentials for the job after 
celebrating his first match in charge with a 4-0 win over Norwich last 
weekend.

A
 groundswell of support is growing for Giggs to be offered the job after
 the United veteran was appointed interim boss last week but Old Trafford chiefs appear reluctant to consider Giggs at this stage of his career.

Ruled out: Carlo Ancelotti (right, celebrating Real's win over Bayern) doesn't want to manage United

Van Gaal moved a step closer to 
becoming United’s new manager when Carlo Ancelotti ruled himself out of the running.

United
 are understood to have delayed Van Gaal’s appointment to see if 
Ancelotti would emerge as a genuine alternative or, at the very least, 
to use him as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with the Dutchman.

But Real reaching the Champions League final means the Italian will probably extend his stay beyond this season.

Alternative: But Diego Simeone (centre) might not be available until late May

Another
 candidate, Atletico boss Diego Simeone, will also be out of reach until
 late May if the his side overcome Chelsea in Wednesday night's 
Champions League semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge.

United
 will now come under pressure to appoint Holland coach Van Gaal before 
his World Cup commitments begin in earnest with a training camp on May 
7.
