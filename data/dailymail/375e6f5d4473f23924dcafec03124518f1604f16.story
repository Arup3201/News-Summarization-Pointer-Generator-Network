With five 'guest cottages', two staff houses and a double-storey house to choose from, there's no shortage of choice when it comes to finding a bedroom in the Cape Town mansion once owned by Earl Spencer.

The property, which was sold off by the Earl in 2000, is back on the market and comes complete with a suite used by Princess Diana that has been preserved intact since her death in 1997.

Tarrystone, which is in the upmarket Cape Town suburb of Constantia, also boasts two vineyards which between them produce 300 bottles of wine a year - and one of the main reasons for the eye-watering 80 million rand (£4.8 million) price tag.

Lavish: The deluxe suite last used by Princess Diana in January 1997 has been preserved intact since her death 

Luxury: The property includes £500,000 worth of artworks and curtains made from luxury fabric sourced in Venice

Visit: Princess Diana was a regular visitor to South Africa and met the late Nelson Mandela during one of her trips

Lavish though the property is, it is most famous for its royal connection and was last visited by the princess in January 1997, months before she was killed in a car accident in Paris. Her heartbroken brother, Earl Spencer, made his first statement to the press on the steps of the house days later.

'While the home has been beautifully renovated, the suite that Princess Diana stayed in as late as the January before her death has been preserved as it was,' said a spokesman for estate agents, Seeff.

The suite, which boasts a kitchenette and an en-suite bathroom as well as a large bedroom, sits inside the main four-bedroom property, along with a 10-seater cinema room.

Also included in the sale are several guest cottages, a garden that comes complete with a 'jungle gym' and koi pond, and £500,000-worth of well-preserved artworks.

Tragedy: A grieving Earl Spencer made his first statement to the press following Princess Diana's death on the steps of the property

Missed: Princess Diana enjoyed many happy holidays at the property, as did her sons Princes William and Harry

Spacious: The property also includes two vineyards which produce, on average, 300 bottles of wine a year and views of Table Mountain

Beautiful: Although the Princess Diana suite is unchanged, the rest of the house has been totally renovated

Airy: The four-bedroom property also comes with seven external cottages - five for guests and two for staff

Other amenities include a manager's office, a guard house, a tennis court and a swimming pool, and the property also boasts spectacular views of Table Mountain.

Despite the hefty price tag, estate agents Seeff say they have already had several enquiries about the property, which has been sold three times since being sold by Earl Spencer, who has now returned to the UK permanently, in 2000.

The Earl, who married for the third time in 2011, now lives at the Spencer family seat Althorp in Northamptonshire with his Canadian wife Karen and their two-year-old daughter Lady Charlotte Diana Spencer, who was named for his late sister.
