Exactly where the mutual animosity comes from is a mystery but the friction between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi was clear for all to see at the Ballon d’Or awards for the best footballer in the world.

The body language of both players and their partners as they sat waiting for the result spoke volumes. Scratch a little deeper and it’s clear from both players’ vote in the competition that they could not bring themselves to recognise the other’s remarkable talents.

For the record, Ronaldo, who tearfully accepted the top award, voted for Gareth Bale, Mesut Ozil and Radamel Falcao. Messi plumped for Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Neymar. Friendship, Spanish football politics and sheer childishness came before a genuine appraisal of genius.

And the world’s two finest players were not alone. One only had to look at FIFA’s website to appreciate the degree of tactical voting that goes on in football’s answer to the Eurovision Song Contest.

Ronaldo even brought a bit of Eurovision to his acceptance speech, shedding Dana International-style tears.

Yes, we ended up with the right result, but closer analysis of how the votes were cast made the whole thing a bit of a farce and something of an embarrassment to FIFA.

The Ballon d’Or is supposed to be a night when rivalries are put to one side to celebrate football at its finest. In concept it is similar to Eurovision, which was designed to help heal the scars of war-torn Fifties Europe in an attempt to celebrate a multi-cultural continent.

In Zurich on Monday night, Ronaldo and Messi did at least say the right things. Ronaldo was deserving of his award, remarked Messi, and from the Real Madrid superstar came similar words of respect. But the body language was dreadful, with Ronaldo’s girlfriend Irina turning her back on Messi’s partner Antonella as the couples sat side by side. It was plain rude.

Body language was dreadful. It was plain rude

The two men really should get on better, given how much they have in common. Both are from impoverished backgrounds — Messi’s father was a steel worker in Argentina, Ronaldo’s a gardener in Madeira — and they have risen to the top not only because of their tremendous talent but because of an incredible work ethic.

But they have embraced their success in a different manner. Messi seems more down to earth, often arriving at training in a tracksuit, while Ronaldo often looks as though he has just walked off a Milan catwalk. That said, Messi seemed to be over-compensating at the Ballon d’Or when he opted for a daring, deep red dinner suit in contrast to Ronaldo’s more traditional black tuxedo.

That difference in style fuelled the footballing equivalent of a diplomatic incident last October, when Sepp Blatter told an Oxford University audience that he preferred Messi, praising his modesty. Blatter went on to imply that Ronaldo was far too interested in hair products.

The rift between Ronaldo and Messi certainly goes beyond their respective roles as ambassadors for adidas and Nike. When major commercial opportunities have been presented to the two of them, one has been known to reject such offers upon discovering that the other is involved.

Perhaps the issue stems from an exchange that allegedly took place at the 2009 ceremony. Messi won the award for the first time and Ronaldo, having emerged triumphant the previous year, whispered to Messi to enjoy his moment because the award would soon be coming back to him.

It must, therefore, have wounded him to see the diminutive Argentine beat him to the prize for the following three years.

Some argue that what animosity does exist is generated not by the players but by those around them. In an attempt to establish his client as the undisputed No 1, Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes even played a part in creating a rival awards ceremony — the Globe Soccer Awards — in 2010.

But the childish voting by both players is, let’s be honest, the clearest indication that a problem exists between the two.

Ronaldo and Messi were given a vote because they are captains of their national teams — leaders of men and, you would think, above such infantile behaviour.

They were not alone. With a clear Real Madrid bias, Iker Casillas went for Ronaldo but ignored Messi. Germany’s Philipp Lahm went for his Bayern Munich colleague Franck Ribery ahead of both of them. Hugo Lloris also went for Ribery, as a fellow Frenchman, and Robin van Persie chose another Dutchman in Arjen Robben. 

Patriotism: Robin van Persie voted for his Dutch countryman Arjen Robben

Some of the national coaches were no better. Argentina’s man went for Messi, Portugal’s went for Ronaldo and, lo and behold, the France manager went for Ribery.

And how did England’s players score? Well, in the best Eurovision tradition, nul points. On Tuesday, Rio Ferdinand lavished praise on both Ronaldo and Messi.

‘I’m still truly astonished by the drive and determination to stay at the top by not only Ronaldo but Messi too,’ he said. ‘It’s been a joy to witness these two push each other week in, week out.

'The question I ask however is: would they be as relentless in scoring so many goals without each other, breaking every record along the way?’

Ferdinand may have a point. They need each other and the animosity obviously plays its part in that competitive ‘anything-you-can-do’ tussle between two of the greatest players to have graced a football pitch.

Football may well be the winner.  Ronaldo and Messi have both brought joy and excitement to all of us. But it might not be the worst idea for FIFA to change the voting process to avoid further embarrassment.

‘Viva Ronaldo,’ declared Ferdinand. Viva la diva, more like.
