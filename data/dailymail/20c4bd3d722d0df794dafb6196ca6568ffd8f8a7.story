Ray Compton was reported to the council by a passer-by after being seen standing on a chair to hang fairy lights

When a string of decorative fairy lights came loose outside his restaurant, Ray Compton stood on a chair and hooked them back in place with a broom.

The 25-second task was soon forgotten – but not by health and safety zealots at the local council.

A passer-by reported what had happened to officials, and Mr Compton received a call four days later from an environmental health officer who announced that the case was under investigation.

During the ticking off he was warned that he could face further action for supposedly putting himself at risk by hanging the lights 12ft off the ground. 

He was also told he should have used correct climbing apparatus, namely an ‘aluminium construction secured at three points’ – council jargon for a ladder.

Yesterday the married father-of-one attacked the waste of taxpayers’ money, saying: ‘This really is barmy British bureaucracy.

‘I thought it was a prank call so I don’t think I was very co-operative with the officer. I was asking if I should have requested permission to have the high street closed and perhaps made sure that St John Ambulance were on standby.’

He added: ‘It really is a case of health and safety gone mad. We have to have some common sense in this life – the council cannot nanny everyone.’

Mr Compton, who owns the Intimo-Fresco Italian restaurant in Maldon, Essex, saw the lights had come loose during high winds on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve.

The street was virtually deserted at the time so there was no risk of anyone knocking him, and the seat of the chair was only around 18 inches away from the ground.

He said: ‘It could not have taken more than 25 seconds to sort out, it really was that quick. The chair is very solid and I feel safer standing on it than I do on a ladder.’

A council spokesman said: ‘Following a complaint from a member of the public about unsafe working practices, an environmental health officer phoned the business to establish if there was any truth to the allegation. 

'The officer discussed working at height and advised that appropriate equipment should be used. The council is not proposing to take any further action.’
