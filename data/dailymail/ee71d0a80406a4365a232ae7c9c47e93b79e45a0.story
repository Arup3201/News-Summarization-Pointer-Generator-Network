The Roman Catholic archbishop of San Francisco has unveiled a controversial document that instructs  staff at Catholic high schools to refrain from saying or doing anything publicly that contradicts church doctrine.

Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone's new faculty handbook describes homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, birth control, sex outside of marriage, the viewing of pornography and masturbation as 'evil.' 

The handbook additions would take effect in the 2015-16 school year at Archbishop Riordan and Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep in San Francisco, Marin Catholic in Kentfield, and Junipero Serra in San Mateo County.

The Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Religion and Faith Program said the 'moral clauses' proposed by Archbishop Cordileone 'stand in stark relief to the message of inclusion being promoted by Pope Francis'

Lisbeth Melendez Rivera, a director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Religion and Faith Program, said: 'The new "moral clauses" proposed by Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone stand in stark relief to the message of inclusion being promoted by Pope Francis.' 

The handbook clarifies that even though California allows same-sex marriages, holy matrimony can only take place between a man and a woman.

Cordileone's document calls sperm donation, the use of a surrogate and other forms of 'artificial reproductive technology' evil as well, the San Francisco Gate reported.

The archbishop stressed the handbook additions are meant to provide clarity for teachers and not to target any educators for dismissal.

Cordileone said in a in a YouTube video: 'The intention is certainly not to pry into the private lives of the teachers. 

'We certainly aren't going to do that. 

'People are entitled to their private lives, but teachers also have to respect the mission of the school in the way they live their public lives.'

Archdiocesan Federation of Teachers President Lisa Dole, a social studies teacher at Marin Catholic, said union members were still digesting what Cordileone had to say.

Union leaders said in a statement: 'We are pleased that the document acknowledges that the teachers in our high school are not all the same, like many Catholics around the world who struggle with their adherence to some of the teachings of the church.

'However, there are still concerns with the proposed language and some key issues that the union and archbishop are hopeful that we will be able to work out.'

The US Supreme Court has exempted churches and religious schools from having to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws for employees in 'ministerial roles.'  

Confusion about the Church's stance is prevalent in areas of sexual morality and religious discipline. For this reason, the statements for inclusion in the faculty handbook focus on these two areas. This focus does not imply lesser importance to Catholic teachings on social justice, which in fact are widely accepted and well interpreted in Catholic educational institutions. The areas requiring clarification are in Catholic teachings on sexual morality and religious practice.

 Having clear statements especially about 'hot button issues' related to faith and morals is important to teachers for two reasons. The first is that a forthright statement of the Church's position on these issues helps teachers provide good perspectives to their students who often struggle in these areas.

The second reason is that candid formulation of Church doctrine protects those teachers who don't agree with the statements. That sounds counterintuitive, but it is indeed the case. In a society in which confusion reigns about Church teachings, highlighting the controversial issues alerts teachers to avoid contradicting Church teaching on these issues either in the school or in some public way outside the classroom.

Liberal San Franciscans have viewed Cordileone with suspicion even before he was installed as archbishop in October 2012. 

As the auxiliary bishop in San Diego, he helped spearhead the passage in 2008 of a state constitutional amendment that had outlawed same-sex marriage in California.

Since 2011, he has chaired the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops subcommittee that works to oppose same-sex marriage nationwide
