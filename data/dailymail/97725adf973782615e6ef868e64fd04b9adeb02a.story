A teenager has told how she was 'stalked' by the prime suspect in the murder of Arkansas realtor Beverly Carter just a few months ago.

Alex Rowe said she was so terrified of convicted felon Arron Lewis that she filed a harassment complaint with police.

The 19-year-old told MailOnline in an exclusive interview that Lewis gave her 'the creeps' after he repeatedly sent her messages on Facebook.

Creepy: Alex Rowe described how her neighbor Lewis wouldn't leave her alone after befriending him 

Arrogant: Alex said that 'He thought he was so smooth that women would just fall at his feet'

'He just would not leave me alone and would keep on sending messages,' Alex said. 'It just got all too much and I had to go to the police to file a complaint. I was being stalked and it felt so uncomfortable. I felt like he was watching me all the time.

'The messages would not stop and it was really creepy. I told him I would go to the police and that's what I did.'

Mrs Carter's body was found in a shallow grave at a concrete company where Lewis worked in a rural area 25 miles northeast of Little Rock. She had been missing since last Thursday after going alone to show a house. 

Lewis was arrested on Monday and is facing a murder charge in the 49-year-old's death. When confronted by a reporter over why he did it, he replied: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker.'

At a press conference on Tuesday, police said the attack was random.

They offered few extra details, but Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay said they were able to track Mrs Carter's phone, leading to the discovery of her body.

The sheriff, however, would not say how she died.

Rowe said that she believed that Carter thought he could get any woman he wanted.

'He thought he was so smooth that women would just fall at his feet,' said Alex. 'He was always chatting up women and saying that he could have anyone he wanted. He thought women would believe whatever he said.'

Rowe, who works as an Avon beauty sales lady, said she filed the harassment report five months ago shortly before the birth of her first son.

'It did not surprise me when I heard he was a suspect in the realtor's disappearance. I would not put anything past him,' she said.

Lewis has a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts.

Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released in Arkansas in August 2013 and was on parole until 2017.

Law enforcement would not release details of Rowe's complaint to MailOnline. 

Alex and Lewis lived next door to each other for several months before the suspect moved to Jacksonville, Arkansas.

Lewis was living in a trailer home in south Little Rock when he met Rowe who was pregnant with her first child.

She said he would spend hours each day on Facebook and despite her requests for him to stop, continually send her messages.

'I was living with my sister-in-law and he was in a trailer next door,' she said. 'I would get all these messages non-stop. They just got so tiresome and some of them were not nice. I felt that he was stalking me and I could not do anything because he was watching me all the time.'

Carter’s murder came after Lewis had been arguing with his 38 year old wife Crystal Lowery at their home in Jacksonville, Arkansas.

The argument got so heated police were called, according to two neighbour interviewed by MailOnline.

'All I could hear was doors slamming and lots of screaming and shouting,' said one neighbour who asked not to be named. 'It was awful. Someone else called the police because it was going on for so long.'

The neighbour said Lewis and his wife and lived in the house for almost a year – and described their relationship as 'very volatile.'

'They were always arguing and seem to be at each other’s throats.'

Lowery, a trainee nurse, has gone into hiding since her husband's arrest. She was briefly seen at the family home on Sunday where she picked up some clean clothes.

Another neighbour told how Lewis asked to borrow a drill on Friday night – by which time police believe Mrs Carter was already dead.

'He seem very calm and there was nothing out of the ordinary,' said the neighbour. 'We always got on well with him and he was no trouble but it is spooky to think he was back here while that poor woman was missing.' 

Prior to moving into the trailer home Lewis had owned a single-storey home in south Little Rock.

Neighbors Calvin and Donna Crutchfile ended up buying the two-bedroom home from Lewis earlier this year.

They said after learning he was a suspect in the kidnapping of Mrs Carter they feared he would come back to the house.

'I must admit I was a bit on edge,' said Mr Crutchfile. 'The house he once owned was empty and I thought he might come back to hide out. It made me pretty nervous and I called the State Police out here.'

Crutchfile said he was aware that Lewis had multiple convictions for theft but said while he lived next door he was a good neighbor.

'He was not trouble. There were no loud parties and we got on well. I knew he had been in prison but everyone deserves a second chance. He is not the first person to go away and come out. I did not hold that against him.'

Another neighbor said Lewis had an expensive motorbike and pick up truck - but never appeared to work.

'I always wondered where he got all his money,' said the neighbor. 'I am told that he bought the house for cash. I could never work out where he was getting his money from.' 

Relationship trouble: Lewis gushed about his wife online in between lamenting them having split up. He also posted an advert on dating website Plenty of Fish, right, looking for hook ups

Prior to his arrest Lewis was active on Facebook detailing his love life.

In July he wrote in glowing terms about wife Crystal. But just months earlier he had said they had split up and declared himself single.

Lewis posted a picture of himself on the online dating site 'Plenty of Fish'.

He was also candid about his criminal past and detailed his various arrests on Facebook.

Among the postings were five pages from a police report where he claimed he was the victim of a home invasion and threatened with a gun.

The police report from October 2013 describes how two men burst into the home he was sharing with his then girlfriend Ashley Mitchell.

One of the men was her estranged husband and in his report to the police Lewis claimed he was threatened with a gun and Ashley ordered to leave.

When police responded they located Jesse Mitchell who denied making any threats. A search of his vehicle and the surrounding area did not reveal any firearm.

When contacted by MailOnline Ashley Mitchell said she had nothing to say.

A friend added: 'Ashley was going through a rough patch and hooked up with Arron. That ended a long time ago and she has had nothing to do with him for months.'

Mrs Carter went missing from an empty home in Scott after meeting a mystery buyer who arrived in a pick up truck.

Her purse was found in her car and the front door of the vacant property open. Her husband Carl reported her missing when she failed to return home.

He later said he received three text messages from his wife which were completely out of character for her.

Despite an extensive search by police and hundreds of volunteers since she disappeared on Friday there has been no sign of the popular blonde real estate agent. 

Tragedy: Beverly's husband and family had been hoping for her safe return before the grim discovery

Lewis was named as a person of interest on Sunday and was briefly held by police after a road traffic accident.

Before an arrest warrant could be issued he fled from hospital where he was being treated for facial injuries sustained when his car skidded into a ditch.

Lewis was arrested on Monday morning after a member of the public recognized his photo from the local media and called 911.

He was captured after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander who had followed him to an office building.

Lewis tried to flee from the Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive but was held and handcuffed.
