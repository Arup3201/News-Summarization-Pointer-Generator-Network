Bank customers should be charged a monthly fee on current accounts even if they are in credit, according to a finance industry watchdog.

Charges of £15 a month could be applied, allowing a fixed number of cash machine withdrawals, direct debits, standing orders and cheques. Any transactions beyond these caps would attract extra charges.

The idea comes from Andrew Bailey, executive director of the Bank of England and the chief executive-elect of the Government's Prudential Regulatory Authority, set up to police the banks.

Free banking: Andrew Bailey described it as a 'myth,' as it distorts the supply of banking services

He said up-front fees should form part of a radical shake-up of the current system in which the 'myth' of free banking is perpetuated.

He suggested that the fees would replace a regime of  back-door charges which banks use to make money from ordinary customers.

The fact that banks pay little or no interest on credit balances in current accounts amounts to a stealth charge

Decision makers: Andrew Bailey, right, is pushing for an end to free banking in Britain. Chancellor George Osborne, left, faces a tough decision over whether he approves of the suggested charges

Separately, customers are stung with high interest rates and penalty charges on credit cards, loans and mortgages.

Mr Bailey suggested one benefit of the fees would be that banks would be less inclined to rip off customers through the mis-selling of products and  services such as payment protection insurance.

* Monthly charges

In a speech to the Westminster Business Forum, he said it would be difficult for banks to introduce monthly charges 'without appearing to collude'.

Consequently, he said, the Government or its agencies may need to take action.

'It may require intervention in the public interest, not least because it is a way to encourage greater competition,' he said.

But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie MP said: 'It's vital that George Osborne's new  regulator is on the side of ordinary savers, who trust the banks with their money and allow the banks to use their deposits to make a profit to cover the costs of their accounts.'

Official customer body Consumer Focus said: 'What mustn't happen is that consumers end up with the worst of both worlds – paying for accounts but still enduring unfair charges, opaque products, mis-selling and poor customer service.'

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'It's a complete myth that banking is free now – consumers pay more than £9billion a year in fees and lost interest on their accounts.

'The idea that if banks charged more, they would stop trying to mis-sell other financial products is completely unfounded.'
