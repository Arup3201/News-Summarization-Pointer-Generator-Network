New South Wales police have found a suicide note but no sign of missing man Geoffrey Hunt after his wife Kim and their three children were found tragically shot dead at their family property in rural Lockhart.

Mr Hunt, 44, hasn't been seen since police made the grim discovery of his 41-year-old wife and their young children Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8 and Phoebe, 6, at their home in the Riverina region, some 80 kilometres south of Wagga Wagga, on Tuesday afternoon.

Police divers are expected to search for him at a dam at the property on Wednesday, after a white ute was found abandoned nearby.

Mrs Hunt was well known as 'a miracle survivor' by the Lockhart community after re-learning how to walk and talk following a car crash in 2012 in which she suffered a brain injury, fractured spine and broken neck.

The Hunts posed and smiled for local newspapers a year after Mrs Hunt's miracle recovery from the crash, in which her youngest daughter Phoebe also suffered minor injuries.

At the time of the crash it was reported that Mr Hunt never left his wife's side while she was slowly recovering in hospital.

The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the quiet town, with a population of only 900, with friends and neighbours of the nurse and her children finding it difficult to describe their shock.

'We are devastated by the tragedy, it's unbelievable,' Lockhart mayor Peter Yates told Daily Mail Australia.

'I knew the family and the people that were involved were well-respected people, a farming family.

'I just can't believe it, especially when there's children involved. They had their whole lives ahead of them.'

Police would not comment on reports a suicide note had been found at the property

Deputy mayor Roger Schirmer described Mrs Hunt, a former intensive care nurse who had recently started work at Lockhart hospital, as 'a lovely person' with 'a lovely family'.

He also said the area had experienced 'pretty tough' weather conditions this year and widespread frosts hadn't been good for crops.

Police found the bodies of three children inside the house, while the woman's body was located on a path at the rear of the house.

Cr Yates extended his condolences to the family members of the victims.

A Lockhart resident working at a service station said the deaths would be felt in the small community.

'God yes,' said the woman who declined to be named.

'We're only a tiny little village. We're all so sad.'

NSW Police have confirmed they responded to calls about 3pm on Tuesday.

About six police cars were seen rushing to the property on the Lockhart/Boree Creek Road in Lockhart.

Local police, SES members and a forensic team worked through the night

A post-mortem will be carried out on the bodies, but it is believed the family suffered gunshot wounds.

Mr Hunt is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 193cm tall, with a medium and athletic build, short brown hair and a clean-shaven face.

A strike force to investigate the deaths has been formed after a State Emergency Service team from The Rock - about 40km east of Lockhart - arrived at the scene before 7pm, followed by Forensic Services at 7.30pm, according to The Daily Advertiser.

Strike Force Tullaroan comprises officers from Wagga Wagga Local Area Command and they are being assisted by detectives from State Crime Commandâ€™s Homicide Squad.

Two crime scenes have been established at the property.

Police are urging anyone with information about Mr Hunt's whereabouts to contact Strike Force Tullaroan investigators via Crime Stoppers

One is located at the homestead while the other is near a dam where police searching the property found an unattended white utility vehicle.

The crime scenes were examined by specialist forensic officers throughout the night.

Police divers will search the dam and other waterways today.
