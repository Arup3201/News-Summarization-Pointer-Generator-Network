At least 10 people have died and 12 others injured after a two-storey hotel collapsed in southern India.

More are believed to be trapped inside the rubble in the Hyderabad building, while another 20 people have been rescued from the wreckage.

Police official Anurag Sharma said more people are feared to be trapped in the debris of the City Light Hotel.

The two-storey hotel collapsed in the southern Indian city of Secunderabad today

An official says the deadly incident killed at least 10 people and injured 12 others

The hotel's concrete roof collapsed - with some questioning whether new interior construction work had played a part

Mr Sharma said rescue operations are continuing at the site, after the concrete roof collapsed at around 6.30am local time this morning.

The hotel is located in the Secunderabad suburb of Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh state.

The Hindu newspaper reported that while the cause of the collapse of the roof is not yet known, police officials suspect that internal constructions - such as including new stoves - could have led to the incident.

The paper reported that most of those 
hurt in the deadly collapse were labourers who were eating their 
breakfast near the restaurant.

The Times of IndiaÂ reported that locals claimed negligence by authorities had led to the building crashing down.

But it also reported that the hotel had been building a huge kiln for cooking haleem, a popular beef dish eaten during the holy month of Ramadan, which may have affected the structure.

Collapsed buildings are a sadly regular occurence in India.

Today's incident follows one in April, when a seven-storey block collapsed near the city of Mumbai.

At least 19 children were among the 72 people confirmed to have died in the collapse, with officials saying the apartment block tumbled 'like a pack of cards'.

A shortage of cheap homes in Asia's 
third-largest economy has led to a rise in illegal construction by 
developers who use substandard materials and shoddy methods in order to 
offer rock-bottom rents to low-paid workers.
