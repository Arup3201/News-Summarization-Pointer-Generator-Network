The spokesman for ISIS who brazenly declared that jihadists would ‘raise the flag of Allah in the White House’ has been killed by a Syrian air strike, according to a message posted on social media.

A pro-Isis Twitter account said of the gun-toting PR representative: ‘This brother Abu Moussa was martyred during missile clashes at the Taqba airbase.’

His death has not yet been officially confirmed.

Reportedly dead: Isis spokesman Abu Mosa has been killed in an airstrike, according to a Twitter account that's sympathetic to the terrorists

Mosa recently granted a journalist access to Isis fighters and even took him to the frontline in Syria, where he astonishingly broke off an interview to take pot shots at government soldiers.

In a video for Vice News, he said: ‘I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established and we will not stop. Don’t be cowards and attack us with drones.

‘Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing. And we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.’

The news follows the revelation that at least one in four of the estimated 2,000 foreigners fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq is British - and half of those are already back in the UK.

Serious questions have been raised as to whether enough is being done to stem the flow of fighters after the Government revealed it has only seized 23 passports this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone.

The Government says there are around 500 British among the fighters while a further 250 are thought to have already returned to the UK where the police and security services are attempting to watch them.

That means there are now almost three times as many British Muslims fighting for Islamic State than there are serving in the UK military, an MP has claimed.

But Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, told Channel 4 News the lack of border controls meant the Government’s estimates of jihadi numbers were too low. ‘I think it’s about 2,000 people,’ he added.

According to the Ministry of Defence, there are around 600 British Muslims currently serving in the Armed Forces - just 0.4 per cent of total personnel. This is far below the 4.3 per cent of the British population as a whole who are Muslim.

Irish police also believe that 30 jihadists are using the country as a base while travelling to and from Syria and Iraq.

The murder of James Foley apparently by 'John' - one of a gang of British jihadis known as 'The Beatles' - has raised fears the killing fields of Syria and Iraq are dominated by extremist Britons.
