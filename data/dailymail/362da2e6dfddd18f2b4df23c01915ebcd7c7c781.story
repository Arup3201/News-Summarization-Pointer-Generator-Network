'Too slow': Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has admitted the civil service lacks business acumen

Britain's most senior mandarin has admitted the civil service is far too slow and lacks business acumen – only days after it was lambasted by Tony Blair as ‘not fit for purpose’.

Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, said he still believed the civil service was the ‘best in the world’ but said it had not always been ‘rigorous’ enough.

He said Whitehall needed to adapt to an age in which ‘everything is quickening up’ if it is not going to be ‘fleeced by the private sector’.

His comments come amid increasing calls to reform antiquated ministries.

Earlier this week, Mr Blair said the service was ‘hopelessly bureaucratic’ and needed ‘radical change’ if it were to adapt to the modern world.

At the weekend, both David Cameron and Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said they would not publish estimates on how many Romanians and Bulgarians might come to Britain once EU restrictions are lifted – because they were not confident the civil service had done its sums correctly.

Downing Street is said to believe that the criticism from across the political spectrum, including Mr Blair, could lead to cross-party agreement on reform.

Sir Jeremy said that, while there were delays, this was due to the need for excessive consultations before any changes could be agreed rather than failings in civil servants themselves.

He added: ‘There are too many 
processes that slow decision-making. The civil service feels just as 
annoyed about that as ministers do.

‘We
 are trying to get the economy moving, the private sector moving and 
it’s frustrating that you have to go through a period of consultation 
before you deregulate.’

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, in charge of civil service reform, said it had to ‘be flatter and do things faster’.

‘The
 world has changed. We need to save money and do things better. The 
civil service performing to the max is a key part of the country being 
successful,’ he added.

Yesterday,
 the union representing senior civil servants warned ministers against 
any moves towards a politically-appointed civil service.

Dave
 Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, said it 
would harm the Government if ministers were surrounded only with 
‘believers’.
