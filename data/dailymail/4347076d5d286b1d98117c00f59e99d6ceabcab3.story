Oprah Winfrey had to go to the bathroom so badly that she knocked on the door of a random office in Los Angeles and asked if she could use the facilities.

Max Lloyd, the executive producer of blog WorldWideKat, was working around 10.30pm on Thursday when Ava DuVernay, the director of Oscar-nominated Selma, approached it

'I have Oprah and she really has to pee!' the director said. 'Can she use your bathroom?'

Ms Winfrey was giving Ms DuVernay  a lift back to her car at the Santa Monica building, where she had been working earlier that day before party hopping, according to the New York Post.

The media mogul then popped out of a black SUV to heed nature's call.

WorldWideKat's other executive producer Kat De La Fuente was in New York at the time and posted about the event on Instagram.

Calling Ms Winfrey an inspiration, she said it was the 'most surreal moment of my life and I wasn't even there'.

'I swear if Max hadn't taken this photo I wouldn't have believed it in a million years.'

The run up to and aftermath of Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony featured a number of Oscar-related events that led stars such Ms DuVernay and Ms Winfrey out on the town.

The talk show host had a supporting role in Best Picture nominee Selma, and presented the award for best adapted screenplay to Imitation Game writer Graham Moore.
