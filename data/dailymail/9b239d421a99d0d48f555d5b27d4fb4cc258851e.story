They are all iconic Manchester derby moments stripped down to their simplest form.

These goals sent one half of the city into ecstasy and the other half into despair and now graphic designer Rick Hincks has re-told them in their mechanical, purest form with his latest collection of prints.

After the success of his collection of minimalist World Cup prints, Manchester-based Hincks has released six new artworks ahead of Sunday's derby clash at the Etihad Stadium.

Wayne Rooney's famous Manchester derby overhead kick in 2011 has been immortalised like never before in a unique set of prints by graphic designed Rick Hincks

The balance of power in the city has shifted in recent years, with City dominating recent Premier League encounters between the two old rivals.

Having claimed two of the last three titles, United boss Louis van Gaal has an almighty task wresting back the power base from United's 'noisy neighbours.'

But both clubs have enjoyed their share of glorious moments down the years and Hincks has recreated some of the most famous.

They include Wayne Rooney's spectacular overhead kick in 2011, Roy Keane's winner to cap United's incredible comeback from two-down at Maine Road in 1993 and Andrei Kanchelskis' hat-trick goal in the 5-0 thrashing of City at Old Trafford in 1994.

And for City fans, there's Shaun Goater pouncing on Gary Neville's mistake to score in the last derby at Maine Road in 2002, Andy Hinchcliffe's thunderbolt in City's 5-1 rout in 1989 and Vincent Kompany's all-important header that tipped the title race City's way in 2012.

Hincks, a City fan, said: ‘The idea to document football moments was just natural, it's great recreating those moments from peoples favourite team, the moments that get the hairs on the back of your neck going and that buzz of excitement in your stomach. It's why we love football.’

‘Creating a Manchester derby collection was simply a must. There are so many memorable moments from each side, I couldn't just do one or two. After letting people vote via social media we have managed to narrow it down to six, three from each side giving a great mix of eras.’

The prints are available from Rincks’ Online Print Shop as individuals or as discounted packages for each club http://shop.rincks.co.uk/ or on etsy https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/rincks
