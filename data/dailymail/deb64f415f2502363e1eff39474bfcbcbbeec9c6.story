The Manchester United squad have touched down in the UK after completing an unbeaten pre-season tour of the US.

New United boss Louis van Gaal led his team out of Manchester airport on Tuesday afternoon as the likes of Wayne Rooney and Phil Jones followed closely behind.

After an impressive pre-season, Van Gaal must now decide who has made the grade and earned a place in the Red Devils squad for the forthcoming season.

Preparation: Wayne Rooney seemed to benefit from the pre-season tour

Van Gaal admits it will not be easy to sign the players he thinks are needed to improve Manchester United.

United landed in Manchester on Tuesday after completing a near-perfect pre-season tour of the United States.

Despite only assuming his position just two days before leaving for the US, Van Gaal racked up victories over the Los Angeles Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Liverpool.

Almost everything went to plan, but the United boss is still not totally content with his squad.

The Dutchman has admitted he wants to sign new defenders before the season starts, but he concedes landing his targets will prove hard.

'Manchester United shall buy players when we can improve our selection,' the United manager said.

'And that is a lot more difficult than you think.'

Wayne Rooney seemed to be pleased with team's pre-season tour as he told the Manchester Evening News: ‘It's been a good few weeks, we've got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football. We've had to adapt. We've had some good results against top opposition so we can be pleased.

‘I think the system suits the team, not only myself. The manager came in and had a look at the players we've got. He's done what he thinks is best suited for our team.

‘He's a tough manager but he's been great since he came in. He's given us all a different way of looking at football, which we haven't had before.

'It's been great for us and hopefully that will continue.’
