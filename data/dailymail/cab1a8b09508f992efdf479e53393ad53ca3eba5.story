Former Queens Park Rangers and Blackburn Rovers defender Christopher Samba has been banned for two matches by the Russian Football Union (RFU) for his response to racist abuse during a Russian league match.

The Congolese centre back was playing for Dynamo Moscow on Sunday when he was subjected to racist taunts by Torpedo Moscow fans. 

In response, a clearly upset Samba stuck out his middle finger to the supporters, and was substituted at half-time.

The RFU took a dim view of Samba's reaction and charged him with displaying an 'unpleasant gesture'. 

Samba attended the disciplinary hearing on Saturday and apologised for his gesture, but the committee decided a two-match ban, the minimum for such an offence, was appropriate.

'We took into account what happened on the pitch and that he was provoked. Therefore we decided to give the lightest possible punishment,' said Artur Grigoryants, head of the  disciplinary committee.

The French-born defender has apologised for his actions but added: 'I want to play football and not have to listen to racial taunts.'

Torpedo were punished for their part in the unsavoury incident by being forced to close a section of their stadium for their next match.

Samba was racially abused in 2012 while playing for Anzhi Makhachkala, when a banana was thrown at him. On that occasion, Samba threw the banana back into the stand and avoided punishment.

The big defender spent five years with Blackburn Rovers and had an ill-fated spell at QPR in 2013
