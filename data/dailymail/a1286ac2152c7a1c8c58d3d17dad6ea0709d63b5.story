Arrest: Joe Lawton was found dead at home two days after being accused of drink-driving by police

A ‘perfect son’ killed himself two days after being arrested for drink-driving because he believed he had ‘ruined his future’.

Joseph Lawton, described as an ‘exemplary student’, was found in his family’s farmhouse alongside a shotgun and a police charge sheet.

Joseph, 17, was caught drink-driving on his way home from a party just four weeks after passing his driving test. He was kept in the cells overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents’ knowledge.

Two days later he used his father’s shotgun to kill himself at the £850,000 family farm in Disley, Stockport. The charge sheet and a letter were at his feet when his father found him.

Following his death, his parents Nick and Jane Lawton successfully lobbied the Government to change the law so that 17-year-olds are treated as children in custody.

An inquest into Joseph’s death heard the model pupil – who had recently gained one A and four Bs in his AS-Levels – was working on his university application and travel plans and had shown no signs of depression or anxiety. But the note found next to his body said he feared being a ‘constant disappointment’ and felt his arrest had ‘ruined his future’.

The jury at Macclesfield Coroner’s Court heard that Joseph was kept in a police cell overnight after being arrested in August 2012. The youngster was driving his new Peugeot 107 home from a party with his friends when he was stopped by police and breathalysed.

He was over the legal limit and was taken to a police station, where he was detained for more than seven hours overnight. His parents were unaware he had been arrested.

Mr Lawton, 53, who runs a building supplies company with his wife, said: ‘He was 17 and had been treated as an adult and I said straight away that was wrong. There was an anomaly in the system.’

CCTV showing Joseph arriving at the police station and undergoing further searches and tests was shown to the jury. As the footage was played, Mrs Lawton, 49, left the courtroom. Mr Lawton said of Joseph’s letter: ‘What he means by that is he can see himself being a disappointment in the future. He had never been a disappointment – he was a very high achiever, he did everything that was asked of him.

‘He was a perfect son and loved by everyone. He thought he’d ruined his future and he wouldn’t be able to reach the standards he wanted to reach.’

Joseph’s family did not know of his drink-driving arrest until after his death because he was treated as an adult in custody without the need for a parent or guardian.

His parents have successfully campaigned for a change in the law to see anyone aged 17 or under treated as a child in custody. The previous age limit was 16. In a statement, the Lawtons said Joseph had made a ‘bad decision’ to drive after the party. They added: ‘We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.

Campaign: Joe's parents Nick and Jane outside the High Court after winning a change in the law

‘The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult while in custody is an anomaly of British law. Once they are charged, they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense. For someone of any age, being held and charged in a police station is a traumatic experience.

‘Few 17-year-olds could make a rational judgement about contacting family or legal advice in that situation without support. Perhaps most importantly of all, they are fearful of disappointing and letting down their families. We believe if the law had been different, Joe would still be alive.’

The inquest continues.
