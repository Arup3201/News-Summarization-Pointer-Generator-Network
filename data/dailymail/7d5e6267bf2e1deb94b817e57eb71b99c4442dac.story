FBI counter terrorism agents have arrested two men in Texas following long running surveillance operations.

The men, Rahatul Ashikim Khan, and Michael Todd Wolfe are both expected to appear in court in Texas tomorrow. They face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of supporting terrorism. 

The FBI said that Khan, 23, allegedly tried to recruit an FBI confidential human source to travel to Somalia to join al-Shabaab, while Wolfe, also 23, wanted to move to Syria to join ISIS.

Wolfe was arrested trying to board a plane in Houston with his wife and two children to Toronto, before continuing to Iceland and then Denmark where he planned to meet an undercover FBI agent.

According to court documents, Khan was arrested after a major operation by FBI Special Agent Jason Cromartie.

According to documents filed by agent Cromartie, Khan used several aliases on an internet chatroom featuring the sermons and lectures of former Brixton imam Sheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Faisal, who was deported to his native Jamaica after serving four years of a seven year jail term for soliciting the murder of Jews, Hindus and Christians.

Khan is alleged to have been recruiting people for al-Shabeeb on a website which featured the sermons of former Brixton imam Skeikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Faisal who was deported to Jamaica following his release

Special Agent Cromartie said: 'In or about March through May of 2011, Khan discussed guns, training, the war against Islam, his preparations for the Third World War, shooting, and getting the youth interested in jihad.'

The FBI believe that Khan was involved with  the internet chat room administrator who wanted the Bangledishi born US citizen to find people he trusted.

The group used 'an elaborate communication method' to ensure that 'the kuffar' (infidels/disbelievers) could not read their correspondence.

Wolfe told an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS having earlier considered aligning with the Nusrah Front but did not want to get involved in a fight between rival Islamic groups

Special Agent Cromartie said that another individual, Co-Conspirator #2 was 'a contact for "brothers" from the UK going to Somalia'.

Co-Conspirator #2, who has not been indicted, told the undercover FBI source  that 'they have brothers from the UK  that would guide' him.

The source was told that he would have to undergo 'training' although he 'would not have to go to the UK, since the brothers are already in the field in "Mog".

According to Special Agent Cromartie, Khan even admitted 'he was interested in participating in jihad in the future and that he could not wait to spill blood.

'Khan said that he was actively searching for recruits for Co-Conspirator #1 and he was the only person he knew of doing this.

'Khan talked about an individual in the UK, who Khan had passed to Co-Conspirator #1.'

Special Agent Cromartie said Khan had expressed a willingness to join al-Shabaab and wanted to know of 'others who might be good potential recruits'.

Meanwhile, the second suspect Woolfe, also known as Faruq, is accused of attempting to 'provide material support and resources to terrorists, including but not limited to personnel, including himself, knowing or intending that they be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, a crime of terrorism, including conspircy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons and damage property in a foreign country.

Khan tried to recruit people to join al-Shabaab in Somalia, who are also conducting a terror campaign in Kenya

Woolfe, who was born in Houston and his wife Jordan Nicole Furr wanted to move to a Muslim country with their two children.

Mrs Woolfe told an undercover FBI agent that she 'wanted to support her husband's goal of travelling to perform a violent form of jihad'.

Mrs Wolfe admitted they wanted to move to an area under sharia control.

Wolfe told a second undercover FBI agent that the hardest part of planning a jihad trip to Somalia and Syria 'was finding the right contact'.

According to court documents: 'Wolfe indicated that he had learned that al Qaeda in Syria was training brothers from other countries (foreign fighters) and then sending those fighters back from Syria to their home countries to conduct terror attacks.

Wolfe said he initially planned to join the al Nusrah Front but instead wanted to join ISIS.

According to court documents: 'Wolfe stated that he had been researching the situation in Syria and he had seen the two groups make statements against each other.

'Wolfe indicated he still wanted to go for jihad, but did not want to get caught in the in-fighting between the two groups, which had nothing to do with his agenda.'

He told an undercover FBI agent that he and his wife were expected a tax refund of $5,000, some of which, it was implied, would be used to fund his jihad trip.

The 23-year-old suspect admitted to the agent that he was trying to earn some extra money by volunteering for a medical experiment'.
