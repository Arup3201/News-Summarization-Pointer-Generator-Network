Many people intending to get fit this year will have already seen their resolution crumble as the effort to actually get to the gym proves as exhausting as a workout itself.

But help is at hand in the form of the irrepressible 80s Lycra legend Mr Motivator who has come up with a way for people to get fit quick in the comfort of their own homes.

With the assistance of Denise Van Outen, the fitness guru has created a series of two minute workout videos - one of which you can view below - which can be done every morning in the time it takes to cook your breakfast porridge in the microwave.

Putting her through her paces: Mr Motivator shows Denise Van Outen how his two minute workouts can be done in the kitchen

Denise, who recently made it to the final of Strictly Come Dancing, told MailOnline the routines are a great way to incorporate exercise into your life if, like her, you don't enjoy going to the gym.

She said: 'I'm not a gym bunny, I don't have time and I find the gym a bit boring. But I can't use the excuse that I can't get to the gym with this workout because you can do it in your kitchen.

'It's free and a good way to 
kick start your day. You can even do it in your pyjamas before you have a
shower and get dressed.'

Specialist equipment not needed: Water bottles can double as weights

The 38-year-old, who is mother to daughter Betsy, aged two, said she finds gym workouts too time consuming.

'I've always tried to keep fit, especially since I became a mum,' she admitted as she teamed up with Mr Motivator for the campaign for Quaker. 'But going to the gym can take half the day by the time you've got there, worked out, showered and changed afterwards.

'I try to incorporate fitness into my daily routine instead. For example, I power walk up a steep hill with the pram when I take Betsy to nursery rather than driving.'

The TV presenter admitted she needed to be in shape for her stint on Strictly - and the upcoming arena tour - because of the skimpy costumes she has to wear.

Working up a thirst: Mr Motivator said the workouts are perfect to do before breakfast

'I felt really exposed in the Charleston costume because it was cut away,' she said. 'I'm pushing 40, standing against Dani Harmer who is 23! My legs are quite toned from exercising but I didn't want to show off my stomach.'

Now thanks to her training for Strictly, she admitted she's the fittest - but also the most exhausted - she's ever been. As she doesn't have a nanny, her and husband Lee Mead had to juggle care of Betsy around her Strictly training and his work commitments.

Denise said while she enjoyed every minute of Strictly, she had 'mother's guilt' for the time it took her away from her little girl.

Now she has more free time again, Denise said the two-minute exercises are a great way for her to spend time with Betsy while also teaching her about the benefits of exercise.

Mr Motivator - real name Derrick Evans - agrees it's important for both young and old people to keep fit, and his two minute workouts are a great way for people to begin.

Revealing: Denise said she's glad she's currently in shape given the skimpy outfits she had to wear in Strictly

He said: 'Two minutes is no time at all. It won't get you super fit but it will give you a start and that could be the start to a new you.

'If you can do two minutes of exercise that you have never done before, you'll feel great about that and then you'll want to build upon it.'

He said it's important to make exercise a habit and then it will become as second nature as personal hygiene.

'When people ask me if I have days when I don't want to exercise, I ask them, "do you have days when you don't want to brush your teeth?".

'If I went out and forgot to brush my teeth, I wouldn't feel same, I'd have to go and buy 
a toothbrush or some chewing gum. And until I brush my teeth, I don't feel right. It's the same with exercise if you get into that zone and
make it second nature.'

Mr Motivator said his 'message from 20 years ago is still the same - let's get moving', but admits they 'haven't re-invented the wheel' with the two-minute routines.

'There's burpies, star bursts, press up 
and sits ups, it's about keeping the intensity for 30 seconds without specialist equipment,' he said.

He added that he loved working with Denise. 'She was great. If I wasn't married and she wasn't married, we could become an item!' he joked. 'She picked it up quite easily which goes to show you can do it even if you haven't done this kind of exercise before.'

Mr Motivator & Denise are supporting Quaker's Two Minute Mover campaign to super start your morning in the time it takes to cook your porridge.Â  To see their fun, 2 minute HIT routines which you can try at home, go to http://www.youtube.com/QuakerOatsUK
