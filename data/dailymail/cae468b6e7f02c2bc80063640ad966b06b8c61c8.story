Wanted: Zafar Chishti, Britain's most-wanted tax fraudster, believed to be on the run in Dubai, was ordered to pay back £5million in criminal proceeds

Britain's most-wanted tax fraudster has been told he must pay back £5million from his share of a VAT swindle worth £176million - if police ever catch up with him.

Zafar Chishti, 34, was a financial director involved in a mobile phone sales scam that is one of Britain's biggest-ever tax swindles.

But he vanished long before police came looking for him and now, as his accomplices languish in jail, he is thought to be living in luxury in Dubai.

Chishti and his associates claimed huge amounts of money from the government in a complex 'missing trader' scam involving the import and export of phones from other EU countries.

They falsely claimed to have traded in four million handsets - worth a staggering £1.7billion - then claimed the VAT on those transactions back from the government.

To make the deals appear legitimate they set up a series of offshore accounts to throw investigators off the scent.

Fifteen gang members were jailed for a total of 66 years in 2012 after the plot was unravelled in a series of trials at Kingston Crown Court.

The complex plot involved the VAT free import and export of mobile phones from EU countries.

The gang created false paperwork relating to the alleged importation, sale and export of phones. The phones were purported to have been sold on in the UK, with VAT added on, through a chain of firms known as ‘buffers’.

Invoices were then created to pull off the fraud.

The gang then claimed to have sold up to four million phones to claim the VAT back from the government - but in reality the tax was never paid in the first place.

Chishti, who was jailed for 12 years in his absence, was yesterday told he must serve another seven if he fails to produce the £5million. But the reality is that police may never track him down.

Meanwhile, Dilawar Ravjani, who is serving a 17-year sentence after he was identified as the ringleader of the plot, was yesterday ordered to repay £30million immediately or serve another 10 years in prison.

Tamraz Riaz, 37, who was jailed for 13 years for laundering proceeds through his business Crystal Cars, was ordered to repay £200,435 within four months or face a further two and a half years in prison.

Rajesh Gathani, 49, described as a phone trader for the Ravjani companies, was jailed for eight years. He must now repay £56,084 within three months or serve a further 18 months in prison.

Millions of pounds had been laundered using a company called Property and Management Services run by Roshan Hussain via an offshore bank and car sales businesses.

At the centre of the fraud was Future Communications (UK) Ltd - part of the Ravjani Corporation Innovative Global Business Group Ltd (IGB) which traded from Commercial House, Honeypot Lane, Stanmore, Middlesex.

Accomplice: John Conroy admitted fraudulent trading and was jailed for three years in the original trial at Kingston Crown Court in 2012

Jurors heard there were more than 20 companies in the Ravjani Corporation which was owned by Haidar Ravjani and controlled by his son Dilawar and daughter Roshan Hussain.

Dilawar Ravjani, formerly of Stanmore, Middlesex, was convicted of conspiracy to cheat and jailed for 17 years in July 2012; Chishti, formerly Watford, was found guilty of conspiracy to cheat and was jailed for a total of 12 years; Riaz, of Wakefield, west Yorkshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the Public Revenue and jailed for 13 years; Gathani, of Pinner, Middlesex, admitted conspiracy to cheat and was jailed for eight years; Roshan, a director of Unique Distribution, which was also part of IGB, trading from Suffolk Way, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was earlier locked up for 12 months for her involvement in the con in July 2012.

John McFarnon, the former managing 
director of IGB subsidiary Unique Distribution, was jailed for three 
years for his role in the fraud.

Businessman
 John Conroy, who owned a luxury villa in Marbella, Spain, was described
 as a shadow director of Unique Distribution. He admitted fraudulent 
trading and was jailed for three years.

Customs
 officers had seized around £170,000 in cash, including £47,000 which 
was found in the boot of a luxury car belonging 56-year-old McFarnon.

Robert
 Alder, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: ‘This 
major investigation uncovered the severe abuse of our tax system by a 
ruthless criminal gang who made a huge profit from the fraud.

'They have already lost their freedom and now their illegal wealth will be taken away as well. These confiscation orders will rid these criminals of all their illicit gains so they can be reclaimed for public finances.’
