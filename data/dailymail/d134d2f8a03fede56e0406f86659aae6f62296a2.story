A subway train derailed in New York City today leaving 19 people injured, four seriously, and around 1,000 passengers stranded in the tunnel.

Six of the eight cars on the Manhattan-bound F train came off the tracks on Friday at 10.30am in Woodside, Queens with reports of heavy smoke in the tunnel. Among those rescued were a woman and her baby. 

Firefighters were seen helping people out of the subway tunnel via an emergency staircase to a sidewalk ventilation grate.

The train, which was traveling on the express track, derailed near to the 65th Street stop. An MTA investigation is now underway into the cause of the derailment.

Four people were seriously injured, including with chest pains, and taken to local hospitals. Some 15 people suffered minor injuries.

The FDNY later said that the train was dark and there was no ventilation. They sent fire crews into cars to calm travelers and reassure them that there was no smoke and just a heavy cloud of dust.

A fire spokesman gave credit to passengers for staying calm in the situation. 

Gabrielle Hesop, 25, told the Wall Street Journal: 'It was like really scary, we felt like it hit something. We thought we crashed into a train, or we thought the train was on fire.'

The E,F,M and R trains are running with service changes and delays.
