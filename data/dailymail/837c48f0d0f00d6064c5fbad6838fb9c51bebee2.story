John McCain was caught sticking his tongue out at hecklers and yelling at them to 'shut up' during a political rally on the eve of the election.

The Arizona senator, who ran for the White House against Obama four years ago, was campaigning for Republican senate candidate Jeff Flake when he made the undignified outburst at members of the audience.Â 

Speaking from a podium in front of the courthouse in Prescott, McCain said: 'Even here in this wonderful square, jerks are allowed. You're allowed jerks.'

He then gestured wildly before sticking out his tongue and adding: 'I'm getting too old to put up with jerks like you.'

McCain then introduced Republican Rep. Jeff Flake to the stage. Flake is battling for the Arizona seat against Democrat Richard Carmona to fill the post being vacated by retiring GOP Senator Jon Kyl.

Democrats, including President Obama, recruited Carmona to run for Kyl's seat after it became clear that then-Rep Gabrielle Giffords wouldn't campaign because of head injuries she suffered during the January 2011 shooting rampage in Tucson.

Four years ago, McCain was at the heart of the election race as he went head-to-head with Barack Obama 
for the White House.

Despite losing the presidential race, McCain remains an outspoken presence in Washington and firmly opposes many of the President's decisions on foreign policy and the military.

McCain told MSNBC last month: 
'Frankly from my point of view I was exactly right about President Obama
when I look at the world today as to what it was four years ago our 
position has dramatically deteriorated.'

He went on to tell Piers Morgan during a CNN interview on Monday that the military and veterans don't trust Obama. He added that if Romney lost the election, Superstorm Sandy would be to blame.

McCain said: 'If he doesn't [win the 
election], it may have been an act of God. It may have been the storm. 
This is what makes politics so incredibly fascinating.'

McCain has campaigned tirelessly for Romney after he won the presidential nomination in August.
