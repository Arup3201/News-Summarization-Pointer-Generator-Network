Seeing as the worst-case scenario is a soggy bottom, it is no surprise The Great British Bake Off avoids the tantrums of other reality TV shows.

But it appears American contestants are finding the gentle cooking competition a bit harder to handle.

Judge Paul Hollywood said bakers on the other side of the Atlantic are so sensitive that they burst into tears every time he criticises their cakes.

Tantrums and tears: Paul Hollywood was surprised that his harsh criticisms of competitors' cakes brought them to tears on the new US version of Great British Bake Off

The 47-year-old has joined a new US version of the hit BBC2 show - renamed The Great American Baking Competition - to air on CBS later this month.

His British co-star Mary Berry has been replaced by American chef Marcela Valladolid, while US comedian Jeff Foxworthy takes the place of hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.

Speaking at the TV Bafta Awards on Sunday, Mr Hollywood praised British contestants for having a ‘stiff upper lip’ and admitted he was surprised to discover how thin-skinned their American counterparts were.

He said: ‘It’s exactly the same show. Same tent, same set up, same stations, same people. Except they are bigger. They are very emotional, and of course I’m not the right person to put up with that. Within the first week, all of them were crying.

‘I said “I’m so sorry, but I’m only saying your cake doesn’t look good.” And then they just burst into tears. It’s all a bit much. But in Britain it’s all stiff upper lip. And then you get crying later.’

Mr Hollywood – who also presents his own one-man baking show Bread – has signed a five year deal with CBS but will continue to judge the UK version of Bake Off, currently filming its fourth series.

For the benefit of American viewers unfamiliar with his fame in the UK, CBS dubbed Paul Hollywood ‘the George Clooney of baking’ in its promotional material.

The series will begin on May 29.

The programme’s successful format has been licensed to 11 countries – including the US, America and France – by BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial arm.

Mr Hollywood admitted he had trouble understanding the American contestants, and said they were less skilled in the kitchen than the British.

He said: ‘We filmed it in Georgia. I had to adjust to the accents. You know the twang. I had to tune in because we had people from the deep south, from Boston, LA, California, New York. I had to tune in to all of them, but in the end I got it.

‘And they got it as well. They certainly got the rough end of my tongue a few times. They sat back too much. I am judging a product, not a person. It is not personal for me.

‘It may be the first time they have heard criticism of their bakes. They have to take it, because it is the only way you get better and better and better.’

‘At one point a contestant pulled me to one side and said “I think you’re wrong.” I said: “It’s fine if you think I’m wrong. Unfortunately for you, I’m the judge.” He just looked at me and just said “English.”’

He added: ‘To be honest, the bakers over here are much better. But we are filming series four now here so the fact is things will only get better in America. You are going to attract a more qualified baker.

‘I just hope the Americans like it. I can see a UK vs US version in the future. I’ll judge it.’
