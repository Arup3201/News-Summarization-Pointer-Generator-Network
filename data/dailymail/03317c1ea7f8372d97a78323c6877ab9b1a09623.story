There is nothing quite like chomping into a crisp rasher of smoked bacon. 

But it seems one person was so desperate for the distinctive taste, they decided to smoke their own - outside the window of their flat.

Joint upon joint of streaky pork has been spotted hanging from the windows of a third floor apartment in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

It is uncertain whether the bacon lover had considered the effects that China's notorious smog would have on the joints of drying meat. 

Or perhaps he was trying out his own unique smoking technique by using the smoky atmosphere to give it an edgy flavour.

The layers of hanging bacon curtained all the windows of the apartment.

Serious air pollution plagues most major Chinese cities, where environmental protection has been long sacrificed for the sake of economic development.

Coal burning and car emissions are major sources of pollution.

In recent years, China has beefed up regulations and pledged financial resources to fight pollution.

In the far northeastern city of Harbin, some monitoring sites reported PM 2.5 rates of up to 1,000 micrograms in October, when the winter heating season kicked off.

In December, dirty air gripped the coastal city of Shanghai and its neighboring provinces for days, with the density of PM 2.5 exceeding 600.
