A secret cinema screening, which was due to bring to life the hit movie Back To The Future has been axed for a second day running causing anger among ticket-holders.

Secret Cinema had already received online criticism after last night's opening performance of the film in east London was pulled with only hours to go and they have already cancelled weekend performances.

It is unclear why the performances have been pulled, with rumours circulating on Twitter that an unexploded Second World War bomb found in nearby Hackney Wick may be the cause of the event’s delay.

The team behind the event have spent weeks building a replica of Hill Valley, pictured, the town where the film starring Michael J Fox was set

The event was billed as recreating the setting for the 1985 hit movie starring Michael J Fox, with fans dressing up in 1950s period costumes and attending the 'Enchantment Under The Sea' prom

The team behind the event have spent 
weeks building a replica of Hill Valley, the town where the film 
starring Michael J Fox was set, close to the Olympic Park in Stratford.

Organisers were expected to let people know by 11am today if tonight's show would go ahead but those due to attend were only told it was being cancelled for a second time when they were informed by email after 2.30pm this afternoon.

The email said: 'Secret Cinema has been running safe arts events for 10 years and on this occasion we have come across a number of issues that we have not experienced previously.

'As you can imagine we are hugely disappointed and share the immense frustration you are all feeling.'

Last night's cancellation came as many fans had already begun assembling at an agreed meeting point in east London for the performance near the Olympic Park

The shows had been seen as a hot ticket with thousands logging on to snap up more than 60,000 tickets online. They cost £53.50 for those aged 16-plus and family tickets cost £140

Many ticketholders, have complained they are now out of pocket due to travel and accommodation costs with some travelling from other parts of the UK having already set off for the venue.

Secret Cinema's Facebook page has also been bombarded with angry posts with many unhappy with the lack of feedback from the organisation.

There had also been a suggestion that the site had yet to be passed for fire safety, although a spokeswoman for the event has yet to respond.

Last night's cancellation came as many fans had already begun assembling at an agreed meeting point in east London.

They had been told to leave mobile phones at home so many were unaware until they actually arrived at the event.

Ticket holders were expected to watch the film, which stars Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown, left, and Michael J Fox as Marty McFly, right, in a replica film set of Hill Valley

The event 
was billed as recreating the setting for the 1985 hit movie starring 
Michael J Fox, with fans dressing up in 1950s period costumes and 
attending the 'Enchantment Under The Sea' prom, as well as watching a 
screening of the film.

The
 shows had been seen as a hot ticket with thousands logging on to snap 
up more than 60,000 tickets online. They cost £53.50 for those aged 
16-plus and family tickets cost £140. A preview evening on Wednesday was
 also pulled.

Among those who vented their frustration online was one woman who wrote: 'I cannot begin to tell you how devastated and disgusted I am. Thank you for ruining my husband's birthday and making a pregnant woman cry.'

Some said they had come from overseas and were unable to attend later performances.

One ticketholder said: 'I have six friends who left their phones in their hotel like you told them to. Combined cost of train, hotel, entry £1000+.'

And another wrote: 'After telling people that mobile phones and similar devices would not be allowed on site, how many people do you think were at Hackney Wick clueless to the fact you sent an email with less than a couple of hours notice informing of cancellation? Not really a smart move.'

Ticket-holders are being offered alternative dates or a 'full refund' for the cancelled performances.
