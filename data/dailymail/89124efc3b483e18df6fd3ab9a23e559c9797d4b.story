In these dark days for Rangers, reminders of past success offer at least some consolation. And so it was for Ally McCoist that, following the latest controversy to engulf Ibrox earlier this week over Charlie Telfer, he took a stroll down memory lane.

In the corridors of the club’s training base at Murray Park, pictures festoon the walls of the kids for fame from yesteryear who now serve as inspiration to the next generation.

Staring back are the fresh faces of Alan Hutton, Charlie Adam, Allan McGregor and Barry Ferguson, who all developed at Rangers from youngsters into multi-million pound English Premier League stars and Scotland internationals.

McCoist deliberately walked down that corridor after Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson took aim at Ibrox in the wake of being told to pay £204,000 to land out-of-contract Telfer, who quit Rangers frustrated at his lack of first-team chances.

The teen midfielder’s case, said Thompson, ‘highlights the need for parents and young players to choose their clubs very, very carefully’.

The Ibrox club’s youth policy has been a highly contentious issue as they have worked their way through the lower leagues reliant on well-paid, experienced former top-flight performers, while many Rangers kids have been sent out on loan.

McCoist, however, is understandably defensive of his record.

While the age of that talented quartet — at 29, Adam is the youngest — precludes them from being used as a recent example of success, they at least seem to have a worthy heir in the shape of Lewis Macleod.

Under McCoist, the midfielder has gone from raw teenager in the old Third Division to full Scotland call-up at 20. He is cited by the Rangers boss as evidence that if you are good enough, you are old enough under his management.

‘That’s absolutely the case,’ stressed McCoist. ‘Lewis has come in and done great, while young Fraser Aird has also come in and done well.

‘I think a lot of people would agree with me that it’s easier for youngsters to break into teams outwith the Old Firm. I wouldn’t say the pressure to win is as great at other clubs as it is at the Old Firm.

‘But we’ve have had lots of younger boys break into our team in recent years.

‘In fact, I was just looking at some of the lads who have come through at this club in recent years: McGregor, Hutton, Adam, Ferguson — (and now) Macleod and Aird. There’s been a reasonable few.

‘Of course, in an ideal world, if I could field 11 players from Murray Park that would be the dream scenario. But we all know that’s not going to happen.

‘That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be taking the responsibility of producing young talent seriously. We always have done that – and that will always be the case.’ McCoist claims he felt Telfer lacked a bit of physicality and was not quite ready to be a regular starter in the Rangers first team until this season, although he insists the 19-year-old left for Tannadice with his best wishes.

‘Charlie was perfectly entitled to turn down our offer,’ the Rangers boss continued.

‘But I feel he would have got a chance with us this season, absolutely. Charlie is an excellent talent, of that there can’t be any doubt. But one of the reasons Charlie didn’t come in at the same time as Lewis Macleod was we felt we had to look after Charlie a little bit more.

‘Lewis certainly handles the aggressive side of the game a lot better and we just felt, as talented as Charlie was and is, we had to look after him that little bit more.

‘With the greatest of respect, particularly in the last couple of years, the standard of the leagues is as such that the younger ones would have needed protected - particularly in the (old Third Division)

‘If we’d fielded a team of youngsters we wouldn’t have won the league. I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t think it would have happened.

‘That kind of statement is made by people that didn’t know the bottom tier or the standard of opposition, the quality of opposition or the physical prowess of the opposition. You have to get a balance.

‘But the fact (we felt Charlie needed looked after at that level) should not be to the detriment of how I felt about him or what hopes and aspirations we had for him at the football club.

‘And I have to tell you he leaves here with our blessing. I say to every youngster that leaves our club - and I genuinely mean it - that I hope they go on and do well in their careers.

‘The ones I release I say to them to go out and prove me wrong at another club. That's when one door closes another one opens. I genuinely mean that.’

Defender Lee Wallace comes back into the squad for the match at Queen of the South as Rangers try to get the win to move within six points of Hearts, albeit with a game more played. But keeper Cammy Bell remains in the treatment room along with Macleod.

Despite the importance of the game, McCoist is looking forward to meeting up beforehand with his old Kilmarnock team-mate James Fowler, who recently succeeded Jim McIntyre in the dugout at Palmerston.

‘I’m not sure I expected James to become a manager because he was very young when I was at Kilmarnock. But everyone was very young when I was at Kilmarnock,’ said McCoist who turned 36 just weeks after leaving Ibrox for Rugby Park in 1998.

‘He was a very good player and a brilliant lad. I hoped he would get the Queens job and so did Ian Durrant and Kris Boyd, who both know him well, too.

‘So far he’s taking to football management like a fish to water. Or a duck, or a shark; a hammerhead! I look forward to catching up with him on Friday.’
