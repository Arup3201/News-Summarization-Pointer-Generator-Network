Republican Michele Bachmann has accused President Obama of plunging the world into the biblical End Times. 

The House Tea Party Caucus founder and right-wing luminary accused Obama of giving aid to terrorists, citing this as proof that we have entered the Last Days.

The four-term House member, who represented Minnesota's 6th Congressional District since 2007 made the comments in an interview on Saturday on the Christian radio program Understanding the Times.

Michele Bachmann has blamed President Obama for plunging the world into the biblical End Times

'President Obama waived a ban on arming terrorists in order to allow weapons to go to the Syrian opposition,' Bachmann said. '

Your listeners, U.S. taxpayers, are now paying to give arms to terrorists including al Qaeda.'

She continued: 'This happened, and as of today, the United States is willingly, knowingly, intentionally sending arms to terrorists, now what this says to me, I’m a believer in Jesus Christ, as I look at the End Times scripture, this says to me that the leaf is on the fig tree and we are to understand the signs of the times, which is your ministry, we are to understand where we are in God’s end time history.'

Bachmann has become infamous for her 
outlandish statements and made an earlier End Times predicition about the world ending in 2006.

At the weekend teen star-turned-bad girl Miley Cyrus appeared in the form of a twerking Michele Bachmann, mocking the federal government shutdown on Saturday Night Live.

Miley's skit featured the 20-year-old pop singer dancing in skimpy clothing in parody of her new song, 'We Can't Stop' - portraying the conservative Tea Party politician for a video titled 'We Did Stop The Government.'

Bachmann has become known for her wild statements, which have included:

An earlier End Times prediction that had the world ending in 2006.

In 2011, she said the HPV vaccine causes 'retardation' and has 'very dangerous consequences.'Also in 2011 Bachmann offered a 'happy birthday' message to the late singer Elvis Presley  even though August 16 was the anniversary of his death in 1977.

In an interview with the conservative website Pajamas Media she said:  'I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the 
swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter.
And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an 
interesting coincidence.' The president was in fact Republican Gerald 
Ford.

In 2008 she said Barack Obama’s associations raise the possibility that he has 'anti-American views.'

The former presidential candidate 
Bachmann was involved in a scandal earlier this week when Iowa state 
Senator Kent Sorenson resigned after a special investigator found it 
likely he violated ethics rules by taking money from political entities 
connected her, and then denying he'd done so.

Democrats say Speaker Boehner and his 
Republican colleagues in the House forced government shutdown in an 
attempt to defund ObamaCare, the health care law passed almost entirely 
by Democrats in 2009.

Earlier this year Bachmann announced that her career in Congress will end after the 2014 elections.

Bachmann has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a Congress-related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

Former campaign aides first leveled that accusation, and both the Office of Congressional Ethics and the federal Election Commission are investigating.

The FBI has also made inquiries into charges that Bachmann's presidential campaign made secret payments to Iowa Republican state Senator Kent Sorenson for help in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses.

Former Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman 'knew and approved' of unethical payments to Sorenson.

But Bachmann insisted in her YouTube announcement video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong.

Bachmann narrowly won re-election last year, beating Democrat Jim Graves by just 4,200 votes, a margin of 1.1 per cent.
