Mario Balotelli is off to AC Milan after Manchester City agreed a £20m deal with the Italian club this afternoon.

City have accepted an offer from Milan understood to be in the region of £17million plus £2.5m in add-ons.

Balotelli has also helped the deal to go through by agreeing a pay-cut of nearly £1m so he could join his boyhood club on a £3m-a-year deal.

He is now set to pull out of the City squad for tonight’s game at QPR and fly to Milan to complete the move.

The news emerged just hours after a Manchester United fan was caught urinating on the £160,000 Bentley belonging to rival City footballer Mario.

These photos, reportedly taken on 
Sunday
night, show the supporter taking a leak on the driver's side door of 
the camouflaged supercar while the 22-year-old striker was eating a meal with friends.

Balotelli's Bentley is easily 
identifiable and a group of friends, all from the red half of the city, 
appear to have stumbled across the car outside Manchester's trendy Indian restaurant Zouk.

It is some send-off for the controversial Italian, who may finally be leaving City this week after Italian
giants AC Milan opened talks with the Premier League champions
about a £24m move.

Rumours of his departure grew further today after it was claimed he hosted what appeared to be a leaving party at his £3million rented mansion in Cheshire.

The player reportedly told friends they could have anything they liked as a souvenir, except his underwear.

A Manchester City insider told The Sun: 'Mario got his mates round and told them they could take whatever they wanted so they took a lot of designer gear and some football memorabilia including shirts. But he told all of them not to touch his pants.'

Items he gave away included football boots, City tops, footballs and designer clothes.

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who returned to Twitter this week after self-imposed exile, said: 'Seems like Mario Balotelli is on his way to Milan. Must say, I think I'll miss the madness.'

Mario Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, told MailOnline: 'I'm not interested in talking to the press' before hanging up.

Balotelli was seen carrying some belongings from the club's training 
ground yesterday, where he reportedly said his farewells to team-mates and signed a shirt for coach Brian Kidd.

He then joined his team-mates in London for the game 
against QPR at Loftus Road tonight.

Last week, it was revealed Balotelli had given notice on his plush mansion four-bedroom property 
in the WAGs' mecca of Alderley Edge, which boasts a heated indoor 
swimming pool, wine cellar, private cinema and even an astro turf 
putting green for perfecting those golf strokes.

The 
property, which has gone on the market for a cool £13,500 a month, also houses a lounge and media suite with 
an enormous wall-mounted flat screen, a wine cellar to store supplies 
for impromptu parties, and a 'spectacular' leisure suite with heated 
swimming pool and gym.

Balotelli's
decision to leave the property, which will be available from February 
16, fuelled speculation the larger-than-life Italian could leave the UK for football abroad.

The 22-year-old, who
regularly hits the headlines for his antics on and off the football 
pitch, was involved in a training ground bust-up with City boss Roberto 
Mancini earlier this month.

In December, he was also fined £340,000 after missing a fifth of City's games through suspension.

But he has enjoyed success on the 
pitch since his move three years ago, scoring 20 goals in 54 league 
appearances for City and winning the Premier League and FA Cup.

He also made headlines when he 
accidentally set another of his Cheshire homes on fire after he and his 
friends let off fireworks 
inside.

The eccentric 
sportsman famously set his rented £3million home in Manchester alight in
2011 after setting off the pyrotechnics  in the bathroom.

Milan
are understood to have offered £20m for Balotelli but City, who have also had vague 
contact from Juventus, are determined to stick to their valuation.

Milan
are expected to make another bid for the Italy forward after their 
audacious last-minute move for former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba fell
through.
