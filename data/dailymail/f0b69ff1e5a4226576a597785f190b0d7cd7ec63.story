The appointment of the new leader of the Church of England turned to farce and suspicion yesterday amid allegations of a betting coup.

As the BBC joined the ranks of those naming the Bishop of Durham as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, bookmakers accused churchmen of using insider knowledge to make money and suspended betting on the appointment.

The odds on the Rt Rev Justin Welby dropped from 7/4 to an odds-on 1/2 in one day. There were said to have been several betting accounts opened by  people in South-West London, who then put money on Dr Welby

Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: ‘Heavens above, if it does turn out to  be Justin Welby, we won’t be surprised, but we will be left wondering whether  anything is sacred.

‘This race always seems to end with a betting coup. In the space of less than an hour we had to cut the odds three times, so took the decision to close the book.’

He added: ‘I don’t know the motives of those who opened a new account just to bet on the new archbishop but I’ll be looking up to see how many churches get new roofs in the coming months.’

Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: ‘Punters were backing Welby like defeat was out of the question.’

He added: ‘The money we’ve seen suggests an announcement is only moments away.

‘Perhaps people thought we’d be too preoccupied with events in America to spot a gamble on the next Archbishop of Canterbury.’

Labour MPs demanded an inquiry, with one describing the appointment as ‘a shambles’. Among those already congratulating Dr Welby this week was Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who heads the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, of which Dr Welby is a member.

The BBC reported that Downing Street has confirmed an announcement will be made today and sources have told the Mail that Dr Welby is the new archbishop.

Yet Church officials insisted the rumours were ‘speculation’. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It’s pretty shabby if someone had knowledge that Bishop Welby was on his way to becoming the archbishop and put a bet on it.

‘The whole system for appointing an archbishop is a complete shambles. I don’t see why there has to be this secrecy around it.

‘It should be an open and transparent process. Then you would not have a situation where people know about the appointment and do this kind of insider trading.’

Bookmakers William Hill and Ladbrokes stopped taking bets on the appointment following a flood of money backing the Right Reverend Justin Welby

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, called for an inquiry. 

There has been growing frustration in the Church at the secrecy and length of the appointment process.

A committee to pick Rowan Williams’s successor, the Crown Nominations Commission, was set up in April.

Its failure to produce a name in public seven months later has led to rising criticism.One senior figure in the Church’s inner ruling group complained yesterday of being left in the dark while Dr Welby’s name was freely circulated outside the CofE.
