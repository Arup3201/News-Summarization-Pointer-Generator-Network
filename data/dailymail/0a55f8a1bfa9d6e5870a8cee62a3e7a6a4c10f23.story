A 69-year-old pilot and his two middle-aged female passengers crawled free from the mangled wreckage of a helicopter with barely a scratch after it crashed on the way to a funeral.

Retired company director Paul Barnes was flying his partner Margaret Wilks, 53, and her friend to the memorial service of a family friend when he was forced to make a crash landing.

He landed the £200,000 Robinson R44 Raven on farmland  outside the village of Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire after the engine failed.

But the helicopter skidded and flipped on its side after landing in the mud, leaving the three people trapped inside.

Mr Barnes, who has been flying for 20 years, said he is planning to go out again tomorrow and is already looking to purchase or rent another helicopter

'It was very unfortunate and I was concerned that the engine might catch fire and the helicopter would blow up. But fortunately we all managed to crawl out from under the seatbelts and smash our way free.

'We had only been flying for about three minutes when I noticed the warning light was flashing. Either there was a problem with an engine or the propeller blades, but we started going into auto-rotation and made a crash landing.

'We landed in the mud and because it was so slippery the helicopter tipped over onto one side. Luckily none of us were injured and we escaped with just a few cuts and bruises.'

Mr Barnes, his partner and her friend Bernadette Taylor, aged in her 50s, then made their way across two fields with all their luggage.

The helicopter crash landed at around 11am on Wednesday and emergency services raced to the scene expecting serious casualties. 

The pilot was flying his partner Margaret Wilks, 53, and her friend Bernadette Taylor to the memorial service of a former test pilot in Sussex

But the pilot and  two female escaped without any serious injuries.

They had taken off from a friend's farmland in Salford, Milton Keynes, and were planning to land on a private site in Witchill, Sussex.

All three were on their way to the funeral of family friend John Dixon, whose brother was a retired test pilot for Robinsons.

Once they had all been assessed by paramedics, Mr Barnes drove both women to the funeral service.

Mr Barnes, who has been flying for 20 years, said he is planning to go out again tomorrow and is already looking to purchase or rent another helicopter.

The former director of Fleet Street Travel said: 'I'll definitely be flying again tomorrow. This won't put me off at all. I just need to go out flying again as soon as possible.

The pilot landed the Robinson R44 Raven on farmland just a mile from the M1 outside the village of Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire

Five police cars and a fire engine arrived to find the two women and pilot had kicked their way out of the wreckage

'Both my partner and her friend were absolutely fine as well. We were all unhurt and that's the main thing.

'I'm hoping there will now be an investigation into exactly why the engine failed.'

Inspector Tracey Day, of Bedfordshire Police, said: 'The passengers are very lucky to be alive.

'It's usually quite unlikely you are going to get to a helicopter crash and find you have got survivors.

'I was very pleased when I got there to find three people with cuts and bruises, but everyone had walked away relatively unscathed.' 

The Air Accident Investigation Bureau said it is currently investigating the incident. 

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Fire said: 'We arrived at the scene together with the police and ambulance service and the occupants had managed to get out safely so they were treated for cuts and bruises.

'Very fortunately the three occupants managed to get out and were unhurt apart from the cuts and bruises.'

A spokesman from the East of England Ambulance service added that the helicopter had overturned and was upside down on the ground when they arrived.
