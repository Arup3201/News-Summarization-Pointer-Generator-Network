The Conservatives will need to slash £21 billion from the welfare budget after the election because the pensions bill keeps rising, experts warned last night.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Tory spending plans suggest post-election cuts to Britain’s bloated benefits bill will have to be far deeper than those imposed since 2010.

In a major new study, the respected think-tank said a £7 billion reduction in working age benefits since 2010 had been cancelled out by a £7 billion rise in the pensions bill. 

George Osborne will have to cut £21billion off the benefits bill after the next election in order to stick to his spending plans

As a result, the £220 billion welfare bill is ‘virtually unchanged’, it says.

But the IFS said the bill would have been £16.7 billion higher without changes introduced by the Coalition.

David Cameron has said the Conservatives will impose £12 billion of welfare cuts after the election, including cutting the benefits cap from £26,000 to £23,000.

But the IFS said reductions of £21 billion – almost double the amount announced so far – will be needed by 2020 if the Tories are to stick to their plan of cutting other Government spending at the same rate as that seen since 2010.

It said the biggest cuts to the benefits system were ‘yet to come’. The report said that cutting another £21 billion from welfare would require a 23 per cent reduction in working-age benefits if the Tories continue to protect pensioners from the austerity drive.

And the think-tank warned that if future governments keep Mr Cameron’s ‘triple lock’, under which the basic State pension rises in line with whichever is highest – inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent – it will result in support for the elderly growing faster than earnings and prices in the long term, at a cost of many billions of pounds a year. 

The basic State pension will already be costing £1.1 billion more by 2015/16 than if it was linked to inflation and £4.6 billion more than if it was linked to earnings, it found.

‘Growing pensioner numbers and higher entitlements among new pensioners have pushed up real-terms spending on the state pension by £12 billion between 2010/11 and 2015/16,’ the report said.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves criticised the Government's failure to reduce welfare spending

‘This has been partially offset by falls in spending on other benefits for pensioners, leaving overall spending on benefits for pensioners £7 billion higher. In contrast, spending on benefits for working-age adults and for children has fallen by around £7 billion.’ 

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith last night highlighted figures in the report showing a sharp fall in out-of-work benefits.

Spending on Jobseekers’ Allowance is due to fall from £8.5 billion in 2010 to £5.2 billion this year. The £3.3 billion reduction is enough to fund the employment of more than 120,000 nurses.

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Our welfare reforms – as part of our long-term economic plan – are getting more people off benefits and into work. That means more people waking up every morning with the security of a regular wage and a chance of a better future for themselves and their family.

‘Not only that, it’s cutting the benefits bill too, meaning we can get the deficit down so our economy is stronger and more secure.’

The new report also found there was evidence that tougher sanctions have had ‘some success’ in encouraging claimants to return to work, particularly single parents.

But Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said the Government had failed to reduce the welfare bill despite imposing ‘cruel and unfair’ cuts.
