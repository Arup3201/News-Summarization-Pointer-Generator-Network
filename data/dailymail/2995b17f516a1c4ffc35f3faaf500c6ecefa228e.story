A rare gray wolf killed by a hunter in Utah last December was the same one spotted near the Grand Canyon months earlier, DNA testing has confirmed.

The three-year-old female - named Echo in a nationwide student contest - was the first of her species to be seen in the area since at least 1945. 

She had wandered more than 500 miles in her lifetime in a bid to find a mate and was seen roaming near the Grand Canyon's North Rim and nearby forest in October and November.

The hunter responsible for Echo's death, who has not been named, said he mistook the wolf for a coyote. 

Sad story: A rare gray wolf killed by a hunter in Utah last December was the same one spotted near the Grand Canyon months earlier, DNA testing has confirmed -  she was named Echo (pictured above)

He gunned her down near Beaver, Utah, roughly 150 miles north of where she had last been seen in Arizona

According to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the hunter immediately contacted officials when he realized his mistake.

Wolves in Utah are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which bans killing of imperiled animals without a special permit, but coyotes in the state are allowed to be shot on sight. 

Wolves and coyotes often have similar coloring, but wolves are usually twice as large as coyotes, said Kim Hersey, mammal conservation coordinator with Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. 

Wolves also have longer legs, bigger feet and rounder ears and snouts, she said.

Geneticists at the University of Idaho did  tests comparing DNA taken from the shot wolf with scat samples taken from the animal seen near the Grand Canyon last fall.   

The results were apparently conclusive that it was the same wolf. 

Wandering lone wolf: The three-year-old female's epic journey from the Rockies to the Grand Canyon sadly came to an end last December when she was shot dead by a hunter in Utah

Analysis of the animal's scat while it was in Arizona in October showed it had traveled hundreds of miles from the Northern Rockies in Wyoming

Echo was the first gray wolf seen in the Grand Canyon since the 1940s, when the last wolf there was killed as part of an extensive eradication campaign. 

She had worn a radio collar since January 2014, allowing experts to track her movements. 

Wildlife advocates said the death was shameful, whether or not the wolf was Echo.

'It's very sad either way,' said Michael Robinson, conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The organisation has documented 11 cases since 1981 where hunters told wildlife officials they had shot a wolf thinking it was a coyote.

The investigation regarding Echo's death remains ongoing and could take weeks or months to complete. 

It's not clear yet what penalties the hunter could face for killing the animal.
