On this day in 1912, the Titanic set sail from Southampton on its fateful voyage to New York.

Just five days into its journey, the ocean liner plunged into the depths of the ocean taking with it the lives of over 1,500 crew and passengers.

Over the years, scientists have attempted to explain how this magnificent ship met such a tragic demise.

Claims the Titanic faced a higher than normal number of icebergs in its fateful voyage have been disputed by academics at Sheffield University

One of the most popular theories suggests the Titanic was ‘unlucky’ because it set sail in a year with an exceptionally high number of icebergs.

But researchers from the University of Sheffield have attempted to dispel this as a myth and claim the risk is much greater today.

‘We have seen that 1912 was a year of raised iceberg hazard, but not exceptionally so in the long term,’ said Professor Grant Bigg, who led the research.

‘1909 recorded a slightly higher number of icebergs and more recently the risk has been much greater - between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total.’

Some researchers have argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the Titanic was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years.

Texas State University researchers claimed in 2012 that a once-in-a-lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on January 12, 1912.

The tide dislodged icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland, filling shipping lanes with icebergs.

The ice field in the area the Titanic sank was so thick with icebergs responding rescue ships were forced to slow down.

But researchers from the University of Sheffield have now attempted to dispel this as a myth and claimed the risk is much greater now.

He warned that as use of the Arctic increases in the future with the declining sea-ice the ice hazard will increase in water not previously used for shipping.

The team conducting the research used data on iceberg locations collected as far back as 1913.

The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on 14 April 1912 and was 1,640ft (500m) away.

Previously researchers had argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the Titanic was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years.

Texas State University researchers claimed a once-in-a-lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on January 12, 1912 - setting loose a deadly fleet of icebergs, three months prior to the event.

Normally, icebergs remain in place and cannot resume moving southward until they’ve melted enough to refloat or a high enough tide frees them.

The icebergs from the North Atlantic originate mainly from the western coasts of Greenland and the region is the most important origin of icebergs on the northern hemisphere still today.

Between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total.

Scientists claim the risk of hitting an iceberg is significant, despite the advent of technology to help captains prevent a collision.

While there are no globally-collated figures for iceberg strikes, they happen every year.

The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes.

Natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg-infested waters around Greenland and the Arctic.

Each year thousands of pieces break off from the front of the glaciers but only the largest will one or three years later reach the North Atlantic.

Currents then push it along the coast of Greenland southwards towards the Canadian coast where off the coast of Newfoundland the iceberg gets captured by the ‘warm’ Gulf Stream and pushed in south-western direction.

However, only one per cent of all icebergs reach such southern latitudes.

The Titanic only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg-infested waters.

Today, captains rely on data from real-time satellite imagery provided by missions such as the European Space Agency's Polar View.

But the risk of hitting an iceberg is still very real and while there areno globally-collated figures for iceberg strikes, they happen every year.

For the northern hemisphere, from 1980 to 2005, there were 57 incidents involving icebergs giving a rate of 2.3 per year, according to Brian Hill, of the Institute for Ocean Technology.

The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes.

Natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg-infested waters around Greenland and the Arctic.

‘As polar ice sheets are increasingly losing mass as well, the iceberg risk is likely to increase in the future, rather than decline,’ said Professor Bigg.

Charles Lightoller

The most senior officer of the Titanic to survive the ship's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a 'small low-lying iceberg' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale. 

In the unique document, second officer Charles Lightoller wrote that the ship made a 'slight jar' before starting to go down. 

He also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg, denying that they were guilty of 'negligence' or being insufficiently vigilant. 

Lightoller's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship's owner, White Star Line, in order to secure the full payout of $5 million (£3 million).

The historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £12,000

In the testimony made to Robinson Leech, the notary public for New York, on April 19, Lightoller explained that 'all went well' until 11.45pm on April 14 when the ship struck an iceberg. 

He stated: 'The captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch. A sharp lookout was kept from the crow's nest. 

'The ship was on course South 86 degrees West true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead.

'The first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors. 

'The ship swung to port but struck a 'growler' or small low-lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow, making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound.' 

He went to explain that 'all hands were called on deck' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children.
