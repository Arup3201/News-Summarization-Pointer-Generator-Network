A 28-year-old female math teacher at a Minnesota Catholic high school was fired from her position this week after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage male student.

Mary Gilles was arrested Monday afternoon at her home in Austin on suspicion of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

Her apartment is half a block from the school where she taught, Pacelli High School.

According to The Star Tribune, the police were tipped off by the school in a phone call on Monday morning.

Leaders at the diocese say it is their policy to try and identify any misconduct and immediateely report it to authorities.

'Our prayers go out to those who have suffered child sexual abuse and who have been harmed,' the Diocese of Winona told KMSP in a statement.

'We encourage anyone with information regarding child sexual abuse to immediately report that information to law enforcement and we remain committed to protect all God's children.'

Officials at the school confirmed the student was male, but refused to comment further.

If convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, Gilles would face a maximum of 15 years prison or a fine of $30,000, or both.

Terminated: Gilles taught math at Pachelli High School. It was the school that reportedly tipped police off. Gilles was then fired following her arrest

It is not the first time this week a Catholic school teacher in Minnesota has hit headlines for alleged improper dealings with a student.

Dan Erik Hubbard-Wilson, the tennis coach at Visitation School in Mendota Heights, was charged with criminal sexual conduct after he admitted to a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student.

Visitation is an all-girls school.

Hubbard Wilson allegedly told police he was 25 when the relationship began.
