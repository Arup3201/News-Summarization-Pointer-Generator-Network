At the National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Mead Maryland, a memorial carved into a plaque reads: 'They Served in Silence.'

The motto is in stark contrast to this week's revelations by NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who has now become the most infamous agency employee in recent years. 

But a candid NSA archive reveals the thousands of staffers who been quietly working on America's most sensitive secrets for over six decades.

Strike a pose: The US Army Signal Intelligence Service posed in front of their vault in 1935

Early days: Cryptologists in Korea in the 1950s. The Army Security Agency (ASA) was responsible for supplying the Army's codes and ciphers

Working around the clock: Cryptologists hard at work during the Second World War

Determined: Fleet Radio Unit Pacific (FRUPAC) in Hawaii working on JN-25, the principal Japanese Navy encryption system in 1945

The series of photos document the 
significant changes the agency has gone through since it was established
 on Nov. 4 1952 by then-President Harry Truman.

The predecessor to the NSA was the Armed Forces Security Agency which was set up in 1949.

But that agency did not have much power and lacked a central control centre.

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Walter Bedell Smith sent a memo to James 
S. Lay, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council in 1951 that spurred the creation of the NSA.

Mission: U.S. Army Engineers conduct diving operations to recover Nazi cryptologic records from Lake Schlersee in Southern Germany at the end of the Second World War

Intelligence: NSA's SIGSALY, a secure speech system used in World War Two for the highest-level Allied communications

Equipment:  A UNIVAC 9300 Peripheral Processor, left,  a punch card computing data center from 1966,  and a KY-8 Cryptologic Device, right

Intelligence gathering: M-138, a strip cipher device that allowed the use of multiple alphabets to encipher messages

He observed recommended a survey of communications intelligence activities after observing  'control over, and coordination of, the collection 
and processing of Communications Intelligence had proved ineffective.'

Then-president President Harry S. Truman authorized the agency's creation in June 1952 - he understood the importance of a central spy body as America had become a 
dominant power on a global stage, facing global responsibilities and 
threats.

U.S. 
efforts had led to breaking German and Japanese codes in the Second World War, success against the German U-Boat threat in the North Atlantic, and 
victory in the Battle of Midway in the Pacific.

As war raged in Korea, the creation of NSA allowed the Defense 
Department to consolidate cryptologic support to military operations, 
and to meet challenges that the nation would face in the Cold War.

The agency ran the the VENONA project  - a long-running secret collaboration betwqeen the U.S and the U.K involving cryptanalysis of messages sent by intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union.

In 1953, the VENONA project exposed a massive Soviet espionage effort that threatened national security.

The NSA moved to Ft. Meade  in 1957- one reason the site was 
selected was because it was deemed far enough away from the capital in 
case of a nuclear strike.

In 1960 the agency was rocked after two employees William Hamilton Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, defected to the Soviet Union.

The alarming revelation prompted tighter personnel security measures.

The agency's signals intelligence 
(SIGINT) played a critical role in 1962 in defusing the Cuban Missle 
Criris, a saga which had the world's nations nervously holding their 
breath.

In the 1970s, Dr. Tordella was an early advocate of the use of computers in cryptology.

The 1980s saw former NSA employee Ronald Pelton convicted of spying for and selling secrets to the Soviet Union.

He reportedly has a photographic memory as he passed no documents to the Soviets.

Petty Hohn Anthony Walker, Jr.,  a 
United States Navy Chief Warrant Officer and communications specialist 
was also convicted of spying for the Soviet Union from 1968 to 1985.

In the late 1980s President Reagan attended the dedication of the Operations 2A and 2B buildings.

In the 1990s the NSA provided key information for the Gulf War, codenamed Operation Desert Storm. 

In 2001, the 9/11 terror attacks that
 killed 2,977 people reinforced the need for the NSA as America became a
 clear Al-Qaeda target.

In 2011, the NSA played a key role in the Special Forces - IC Team responsible for tracking down Osama bin Laden.
