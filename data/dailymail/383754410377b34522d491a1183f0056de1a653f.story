Casey Anthony's outspoken lawyer has questioned the role of her father in the apparent drowning death of his granddaughter five years ago.

More than two years on from Casey's controversial murder acquittal following two-year-old Caylee's death, Jose Baez has cast aspersions on why the police never fully investigated George Anthony.

Mr Baez's insinuations in the new foreword of his book Presumed Guilty coincide with the publication of the paperback version and revolve around George telling Casey that 'he'd take care of it'.

Loose ends: George Anthony reacts as he waits for the jury's verdict to be read in the murder case against his daughter Casey Anthony in the courtroom at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, in July 2011

Not guilty: Casey Anthony listens to the testimony of Krystal Holloway, who claims to have had an affair with Anthony's father, during her murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in June 2011 in Orlando, Florida

This statement was in reference to 
how George held Caylee's lifeless body in his arms following her 
drowning and how Caylee's body came to be found.

The
book's paperback version will reach stores on Tuesday - and in the 
foreword, Mr Baez recounts a lunch he had with his opposite number 
during the trial, lead prosecutor, Linda Drane Burdick.

'Regardless
of what happened, whoever threw Caylee into those woods like that 
deserves to rot in hell,' Ms Burdick told Mr Baez, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 'You don't do that to a baby.'

Mr
Baez writes: 'I agreed. This fact disturbs me greatly. It's the one 
fact that will never change. You don't do that to a baby. Whoever put 
Caylee there, I curse you.'

In fact, Mr Baez writes that the entire issue of who dumped the baby in the woods is the 'one loose end that really haunts me'.

Turning
his attention to George, Mr Baez does repeat and stand by the claim 
made by the defence that Caylee drowned in the family swimming pool and 
that Casey and her father conspired to cover up the tragedy.

Adversary: Assistant state attorney Linda Drane Burdick presents the final portion of rebuttal in Casey Anthony's murder trial at the Orange County Courthouse in Orlando, Florida, in July 2011

Mr Baez writes: 'According to Casey, George held Caylee's lifeless body in his arms and, after accusing Casey of being responsible for her death, told Casey he'd 'take care of it.'

'Caylee's body was discovered dumped in the woods. That was all I was ever able to uncover about how Caylee ended up where she did.'

Mr Baez also criticises the police for never investigating George Anthony and dismisses out of hand the notorious report from WKMG-Channel 6's Tony Pipitone that an internet search was conducted on the Anthony computer for 'foolproof suffocation'.

He also turns his attentions to Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. 'compromised' the jurors' safety by releasing their names to the public in the aftermath of the verdict.

Incredibly, Mr Baez also berates the public for 'having no interest in hearing Casey's side of this sordid story.'

Explaining that he took the case because he believe she was innocent, Baez adds that he developed an attachment to Casey Anthony and felt a responsibility towards her.

Never shy, Mr Baez also relates in his new foreword how he cried when he learned that the hardback copy of the book had become a New York Times bestseller - as he tells his readers he is doing well now in 'his dream office' in Coral Gables, Florida, while mainting his Orlando office.

'If ever you need a robust defense, you know where to find me,' Baez writes.

In June the Florida judge who presided over Casey Anthony's murder trial says he was shocked by the jury's 'not guilty' verdict because there was 'sufficient evidence' that she killed her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

Judge Belvin Perry made the extraordinary admission in his first interview since the close of Anthony's trial nearly two years ago.

'There were two sides to Casey Anthony,' Judge Perry told NBC's Today Show. 'There was the side that was before the jury, where she portrayed the role of a mother who had lost a child - someone who was wrongfully accused.

'And then you could notice the change and transformation in her when the jury went out.

'She was very commanding, she took charge of different things, and you could see her sometimes scolding her attorneys.'

Judge Perry said he believes the jury let the young mother off the hook for 
first-degree murder because she was 'very manipulative' and had an 
extraordinarily personable lawyer.

The jury handed down its 'not guilty' 
verdict in July of 2011. At the moment that he read the verdict from the
jury, Judge Perry described feeling 'surprise,' 'shock' and 'disbelief.'

'Wrong' verdict: Judge Perry said 'There was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case'

He said he had to read the verdict twice in his head to make sure he had read it correctly.

Judge Perry was surprised because he believed 'there was sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree in this case,' he said.

He also felt that prosecutors had 'proved a great case.'

'But you’ve got to realize this was a circumstantial evidence case,' he added. 'All the defense had to do was create that reasonable doubt, and that’s what they did.'

Mr Baez, played a large role in swaying the jury's opinion of her innocence, Judge Perry said. 

'The state had better lawyers, but Mr Baez was very personable,' he said. 'He came across as someone that you would like.

'It’s like someone trying to sell a used car. Who are you going to buy it from? The most likeable salesperson.'

Casey wasn't quite as personable as her lawyer, but she could put on a good front before the jury, Judge Perry said.

'There was always two sides to Casey,' he said. There was the public persona that she wanted the jury to see and there was that side that she showed when the jury was not there.'

He specifically recalled a day when Casey fought 
with her lawyers over a suggestion that she take a plea deal for 
aggravated manslaughter instead of first-degree murder.

'I will never forget that day,' he said, noting that he was in earshot of the conversation while she was in a holding cell.

'All of a sudden, you heard shouting coming from the holding cell, some four-letter words coming from the holding cell, and she was quite upset,' he said. 'So upset that one counselor suggested that she was incompetent to proceed.'

Casey's trial was televised and made into a spectacle as one of the most sensational stories of the year, sparking protests, drawing huge crowds to the courtroom and attracting international news coverage.

'I had no earthly idea that it would 
command the attention that it did worldwide,' Judge Perry said. 'It was truly a
fantastic experience.'

He said he didn't think that the 
cameras in the courtroom - which are permitted by Florida state law - 
had affected the outcome of her trial.

'In Florida we've always had cameras and I think people need to know how their justice system works,' he said.

The jury found Casey guilty of four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. She was released from jail on July 17, 2011.

In January of this year, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts.

Asked whether justice has been served in Casey's case, Judge Perry said that remains to be determined.

'Well justice has been served in the sense that the jury has spoken,' he said. 'But justice will finally be served one day by the judge of judges. And she will have to live with this and deal with this for the rest of her life.'
