McLaren chief Ron Dennis has urged Jenson Button to 'try harder' ahead of this week's British Grand Prix.

The Woking outfit are in the midst of another disappointing campaign following on from last year's disastrous season where they failed to register a single podium finish.

McLaren appeared to have turned a corner over the winter after rookie driver Kevin Magnussen and Button finished second and third respectively at the season opener in Australia in March.

But the British team have failed to visit the rostrum since, with Button recording a best result of only fourth at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier this month, while Magnussen's seventh place last time out in Austria is his best finish since Melbourne.

Button has scored 14 points more than his rookie team-mate, but the pair are evenly matched over one lap this term, with the McLaren duo tied at 4-4 ahead of Button's home race this weekend at Silverstone.

'I'm sure Kevin is giving a big wake-up call for Jenson, and in some ways you say: "Great, we've made a great choice with Kevin", but in other ways you say, "Come on, Jenson, you are a world champion and one thing you can do on a consistent basis - and you should be doing it - is beating your team-mate".

Speaking his mind: McLaren boss Ron Dennis

'Do I want him to try harder? Of course I do - he's a highly-paid grand prix driver.

'Yes, we are not giving him the best car and, yes, it would be challenging for him to win in it, to say the least, but he could do his bit and Kevin has to make it as difficult for him as possible.'

Button is out of contract at the end of this season and McLaren have already made contact with Ferrari's unsettled Fernando Alonso about a return to the British team.

Dennis has also targeted a sensational reunion with another of his former drivers, in Lewis Hamilton, and the McLaren chief refused to deny that the British star, whose deal at Mercedes runs until the end of 2015, is on his radar. 

'We would always hope that the best available drivers would wish to drive our cars,' added Dennis.

'The
 key word is "available" because people have contracts and we respect 
those contracts, but if Lewis was in a position to drive for us next 
year, as with many of the other top drivers if they were in that 
position, we'd love to have them on board.

'No
 one should ever feel threatened, either drivers or engineers, all we 
want to do is win and we have to take considered positions and 
considered decisions on that process.'
