When it comes to avoiding the beady eyes of border officers, you can't say they didn't try.

These are the bizarre methods used by the world's drug smugglers to stow away their hauls - but all of them were caught before they could cross the border.

The cleverest failed missions have included cocaine bras, wigs and nappies, cannabis garden hoses and heroin thigh bandages.

Happy nappy: Customs officials at New York's airports have released some of the most bizarre ways in which people have tried to slip drugs past them - including these taped-up underpants stuffed with cocaine

What a boob! Customs officials seized this cocaine bra in New York. Spokesman Anthony Bucci said he had seen everything: 'One person we caught at JFK had inserted narcotics anally, vaginally and swallowed pellets'

Some of the most unusual have been released by customs officers working in two busy airports on the U.S. east coast.

They reveal the desperate and inspired lengths smugglers will go to in their attempts to pass muster at New York's JFK Airport and Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey.  

Anthony Bucci, spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection for New York and New Jersey, admitted he has seen so many odd attempted concealment methods he is rarely surprised.

'Some of the more interesting concealment methods include narcotics concealed in prosthetic limbs, wheels on luggage made of heroin and cocaine and heroin secreted into book covers,' he said.

'One person we caught at JFK had inserted narcotics anally, vaginally and swallowed pellets.

'We even intercepted a dog years ago that had narcotics sewn under his skin.

'I have been with the CBP approximately four-and-a-half years. The longer I am here the less surprised I am by the attempted concealment methods.'

But the phenomenon has never been confined just to New York - as our collection of photos over the years from around the globe shows.

The world's drug dealers have tried to smuggle cocaine in an avocado, a can of Stella Artois and a champagne couple.

In China, a 64-year-old smuggler tried to sneak 5kg of cocaine into the vice capital Macau by secreting more than 100 tiny packages of the drug into little pockets in his trousers.

And the border between the U.S. and Mexico is where officials see some of the most brazen attempts to bring drugs into the country.

The lure of profit from drug smuggling has seen substances concealed in items including a baby's stroller, a lawn mower, a garden hose and concrete garden furniture.

In June 2009, a 30-year-old Mexican man was even arrested trying to smuggle more than 10kg of marijuana ashore on a surfboard.
