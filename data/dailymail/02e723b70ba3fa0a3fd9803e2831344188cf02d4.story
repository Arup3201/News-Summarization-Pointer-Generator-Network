A ten-year-old girl has been left unable to walk, talk or feed herself after being struck down by a mystery condition five years ago.

Brianna Skriver was an active little girl until she contracted an illness which has confined her to a wheelchair and left doctors baffled.

Brianna, who lives in Davenport, Florida with her mother and brother, was recently accepted as one of only 100 people onto a study which re-examines undiagnosed conditions. 

Devastating: Brianna Skriver, ten, has been confined to a wheelchair since falling ill with a mysterious condition five years ago which left her unable to walk or talk

Her mother Tammy Skriver told MailOnline that five years ago, her daughter had started regular kindergarten, played soccer, loved to dance and run around on the playground with her friends.

Tammy, a single mother, said: 'I started noticing that her run was different and
I went to the doctor to ask for a referral to a neurologist.'

Initially doctors believed that Brianna had ADHD and prescribed her medication which her mother said left her daughter lethargic, wetting herself and with slurred speech.

Finally a referral by a neurologist saw Brianna being treated at Duke Medical Center in North Carolina at the age of six.

Tammy said Brianna, now ten, has
undergone rounds of painful and invasive testing including skin and 
muscle biopsies, blood tests, spinal taps and scans.

Everything has come back normal or negative, leaving doctors unable to ever reach a diagnosis.

The ten-year-old stopped being able to swallow food last May and now must use a feeding tube.

Tammy said: 'Day to day, it's 
extremely hard. Brianna is extremely frustrated and often has outbursts.
I'm on a fixed income and it is difficult to work in between making 
different doctors' appointments along with occupational and physical 
therapy.

'My Dad, who is a retired Vietnam veteran, is here to help out but I mostly look after Brianna alone.'

She added: 'Going from having a normal healthy child who is active and laughing, to a child that cannot walk or talk or tell me her pains is excruciating,"

Full of life: Brianna, pictured several years ago, was always an active child according to her mother Tammy before an unknown illness left her unable to walk and talk

Devoted: Tammy Skriver, a single mother-of-two, now takes care of her daughter full-time at the family's home in Florida

Brianna was accepted by the National Institutes of Health's Undiagnosed Disease Program last year as one of only 100 new cases. The Institute is flooded with thousands of requests for help each year.

Doctors extensively retested Brianna but were once again unable to diagnose her condition.

They have suggested a genetic mutation may be causing her illness  - but DNA research could take years to complete.

Brianna has an older brother Austin, 16,
who has never displayed signs of the condition. Tammy added that no 
one in her family has ever been diagnosed or shown symptoms of a genetic disease .

A glimmer of hope came when Tammy came across the story of six-year-old Carli Breytenbich who came to North Carolina from South Africa for treatment for a condition with similar signs to Brianna's illness.

Carli's condition had vastly improved while staying at the Ronald McDonald house in Charlotte after she was put on a carefully monitored diet and given vitamin supplements.

Tammi believes that an IV treatment given to six-year-old Carli could work for her daughter - but she is unable to access the expensive medication which costs  $1,800 every shipment as Brianna is only covered by Medicare.

A veterans' charity has so far donated a ramp to give the family wheelchair access to their Florida home. 

The family is fundraising to care for Brianna and work to find a cure for her via the Facebook page Friends of Brianna.

Donations can be made via a PayPal link on the page or by visiting Wells Fargo branches and asking to donate to the account Friends of Brianna Inc.
