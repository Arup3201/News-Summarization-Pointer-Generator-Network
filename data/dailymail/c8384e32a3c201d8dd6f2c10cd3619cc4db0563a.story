Three BBC workers have been quizzed by Swiss police after flying a drone into a no-fly zone over the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The corporation could be fined for the security breach at the conference, during which the Duke of York addressed allegations that he had sex with an under-age teenager.

Security was heightened at the luxury resort in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris, with a no-fly area implemented over parts of the site.

The BBC could be fined for flying the drone over the World Economic Forum, where a no-fly zone had been imposed

The BBC confirmed a team had been detained by police in Davos for breaking the strict rules.

A statement said: 'We can confirm that in Davos during the World Economic Forum a BBC team mistakenly took a drone into a no-fly zone area.

'Three members of staff were briefly questioned by police and it is still to be determined by the Swiss authorities if the BBC will pay a fine.' 

Prince Andrew addressed allegations that he had sex with an under-age teenager at the conference

The conference had taken on added interest following accusations by Virginia Roberts, a mother-of-three now in her 30s, that Prince Andrew had under-age sex with the woman years earlier.

Andrew, who had faced mounting pressure to speak personally about the allegations, started his forum speech by denying the claims, but made no further mention of them as he went on to talk about his work promoting entrepreneurs.

In the UK, drones must not be flown within 150 metres of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert. 

They also have to be flown at least 50 metres away from any person or building.

Anyone breaking those rules can be fined up to £5,000.

As the popularity of drones has increased, near missed with planes have become more frequent. 

An Airbus A320 had a near miss with one of the crafts as it landed at Heathrow in July.

The 180-seater aircraft was at just 700ft when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar.

A European Championship qualifier between Albania and Serbia had to be called off last year after a drone carrying a political message was flown into the stadium.

The interruption caused a mass brawl as a Serbia player pulled it from the sky, enraging the Albanians.
