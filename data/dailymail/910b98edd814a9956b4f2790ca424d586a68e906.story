Sentenced: Henry Hoare, 18, (right) with stockbroker father Tim Hoare, 63, has been banned from driving after picking up a group of girls double the legal drinking limit

A descendant of the C Hoare & Co banking family was caught drink-driving when he used his new BMW to pick up four girls while at nearly twice the legal limit.

Henry Hoare, 18, whose family live in the Grade-II listed Hollycombe House in Liphook, Hampshire, was staying at their multi-million-pound London property in Belgravia when he was called by his female friends asking for a lift in the early hours.

He had drunk four pints of beer and as he drove home he was stopped by the police for speeding.

He slipped when he was asked to get out of the car and was unsteady on his feet.

The finance student at Bristol University pleaded guilty at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court to driving the black Series 1 vehicle, with excess alcohol in his breath, in  Eaton Square on December 15 last year.

He was supported in court by his stockbroker father, Tim Hoare, 63, who founded the hugely successful T Hoare & Co in 1993.

The court heard how Hoare was well over the drink-drive limit when he was stopped at 2.20am, around the corner from his London home and 500 yards from C Hoare & Co’s Knightsbridge branch.

After failing a road-side breath test Hoare was arrested and later blew an alcohol reading of 68 microgrammes – the legal limit is 35.

Lineage: The Bristol University student, seen outside Hammersmith Magistrate's Court, is the descendent of the UK's oldest bank C Hoare & Co. He was staying at his family's Belgravia home when he took the BMW out

Caught: Police officers ordered him to pull over at 2.20am on December 15 when he sped through traffic lights on December 15 on Eaton Square - just 500 yards away from the family bank's headquarters

On Thursday he was fined £400, with £80 costs, ordered to pay a £40 victim surcharge and disqualified from driving for a year.

Robin
 Falvey, defending, told the court: ‘He receives an allowance and it 
would be  disingenuous for me to say  his family will not pay his 
financial penalty.

‘I 
have spoken to his father, who sits at the back of  the court, and he 
says that since obtaining his licence  his son has been very responsible
 in relation to driving  and drink-driving.’

He added: ‘He never intended to drive … [when] some female friends asked for a lift.

‘At that time of night  he should have told them to get a taxi.’

Henry told the court he had drunk five pints. The court heard his family, which resides in Grade II-listed Hollycombe House in Hampshire, will foot the £520 bill

But
 district judge Davinder Lachhar disagreed, saying: ‘He intended to 
drive and he did drive. These terms are used too liberally.’

She told Hoare: ‘Your female friends should have gone home on their own volition.’

The
 family’s wealth stems from C Hoare & Co, Britain’s oldest bank, 
which was founded in 1672 by Sir Richard Hoare and continues to be run 
by the eleventh generation of his direct descendants.

Chancellor
 George Osborne has his mortgage with the bank and it has only two 
branches, the other being in  Fleet Street, London.

The only way to join is by invitation from an existing account holder.

Former customers include Jane Austen, Lord Byron and Eton College.
