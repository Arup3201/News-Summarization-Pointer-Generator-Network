Life sentence: Turkish waiter Recep Ã‡etin who has been found guilty of murdering two Irish women who were stabbed while on holiday in Turkey

A Turkish waiter has been found guilty of murdering two Irish women on holiday two years ago, it was reported today.

Recep Cetin was convicted of stabbing Marion Graham, 54, and her 53-year-old friend Cathy Dinsmore in August 2011.

The women were found buried in shallow graves in woods 75 miles outside the popular holiday resort of Kusadasi with multiple knife wounds.

Cetin's father Eyup, a taxi driver, was acquitted of the double murder.

Recep Cetin, a former boyfriend of Ms Graham's teenage daughter Shannon has been sentenced to life imprisonment, according to the BBC.

He had admitted admitted stabbing the victims but denied murder.

Ms Graham, from Newry and Ms Dinsmore, from Warrenpoint in Co Down, were close friends and had been on an extended holiday in Turkey when they were killed.

It is claimed they were murdered after Ms Graham refused to allow Recep Cetin - known to the family as Alex - marry her teenage daughter.

Relatives of both women including Shannon, who was aged 15 when her mother was killed, flew out to Turkey for the court hearing which had been adjourned from last month.

A verdict and sentence was previously delayed because two of the judges on the panel were temporary and could not make a ruling on the case.

Proceedings were also held up because Recep Cetin falsely claimed to be aged 17 in an apparent attempt to be tried in the juvenile courts where sentences are lighter.

But bone marrow tests confirmed that the waiter was aged 22.

Cetin had consistently denied his father's alleged involvement in the killings.
