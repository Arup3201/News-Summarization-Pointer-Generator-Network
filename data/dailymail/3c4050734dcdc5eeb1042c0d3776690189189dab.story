Jack Wilshere has been caught smoking for the second time in nine months.

Just hours before Germany lifted the World Cup, pictures emerged of England flops Wilshere and Joe Hart behaving outrageously at a pool party in Las Vegas.

The most compromising photograph is of Arsenal midfielder Wilshere with a cigarette in his mouth, which is certain to anger Arsenal and England fans.

In addition, he can be seen puffing on
 a cigar, having drink poured into his mouth by a fellow reveller who is
 standing outside the pool and there are also pictures of Hart passing 
on a mouthful of drink into Wilshere’s mouth.

Manager
 Arsene Wenger is a staunch anti-smoker but the club dismissed any 
concern last night despite Wilshere being caught with a cigarette for 
the second time in a year.

After
 being caught in October a few days ahead of a match, he insisted: ‘I am
 not a smoker.’ Wenger then gave Wilshere, 22, a public dressing down, 
saying: ‘I disagree completely with that behaviour. When you are a 
football player you are a role model and you don’t do what damages your 
health.

‘You can damage 
your health at home, you can drink at home, you can smoke at home and 
nobody sees it. But when you go out socially, you can damage your 
reputation as an example.’

Wilshere’s representatives had originally claimed the midfielder was dared to hold the cigarette as a joke.

But
 he later admitted: ‘Players make mistakes. I am not a smoker. I spoke 
with the boss and he asked me what happened, I explained to him and we 
sorted it out. It is not an issue I expect to come back. As I said, I am
 not a smoker so I think that will be my last one.’

Wilshere is currently on holiday and is due to report for pre-season training next week.

Neither Arsenal nor Wilshere’s representatives would comment on Monday evening.
