Lou Vincent and Naved Arif face life bans from cricket after being charged by the ECB with corruption offences relating to two county matches in 2011.

The news follow revelations in Sportsmail about Vincent’s involvement with match-fixing, with the ECB bringing 14 charges against the former New Zealand Test batsman.

Those charges relate to a pair of now infamous games three years ago for Sussex: a T20 match against Lancashire and a 40-over clash with Kent.

In the spotlight: Lou Vincent, who is currently being investigated by the ICC, will also be charged with alleged match fixing by the ECB

Arif, a 32-year-old left-arm seamer born in Punjab, who was playing for Sussex as a non-overseas player because of his Danish wife, has been charged with six offences relating to the game against Kent.

Both men have been provisionally suspended from all cricket, and could be banned for life if they are found guilty by a tribunal. It is understood that additional evidence could be used from the T20 game between Lancashire and Durham in 2008.

Lancashire opener Mal Loye last week told Sportsmail that Vincent — his fellow opener in that game — offered him £20,000 to score fewer than 10. Loye refused.

Chris Watts, head of the ECB’s anti-corruption unit, said: ‘This matter is now the subject of formal legal proceedings and we will therefore make no further comment other than to reiterate our determination to bring to account the very small minority who seek to corrupt cricket.’

The ICC’s own Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) had investigated the Sussex-Kent game, but found no evidence to back up suspicions raised by unusual betting patterns. Over £14million was wagered on betting exchanges — more than twice the usual amount for a televised county game.

The ACSU reopened their investigation of Vincent following his appearances for Auckland Aces at the Champions League in South Africa in October 2012, and passed on their information to the ECB.

Last night, Arif’s solicitors released a statement saying: ‘In view of Mr Arif’s right to a fair hearing before the Anti-Corruption Tribunal, we do not intend to make any further comment at this juncture.’
