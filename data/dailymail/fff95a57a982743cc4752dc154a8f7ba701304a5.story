A Government agency is accused of opening flood gates to protect a town's shops and businesses - at the expense of a village full of family homes.

The Environment Agency issued an order to open the sluice gates of a dam near Tonbridge, Kent, in order to save the town's post-Christmas sales shopping and industrial units, it has been reported.

However, the resulting surge of 1.25m gallons of water into the River Medway led to the deluge of the village of Yalding eight miles away.

One of those affected was Erika Olivares, 49, who met Prime Minister David Cameron when he visited the flood-hit village on Friday.

She accused him of failing to deliver on a promise to ensure those living in flood-threatened areas would be able to get affordable insurance cover.

Mrs Olivares, who lives in a Â£275,000 three-bedroom cottage with husband Pablo, told the Sunday Times she was 'furious' with the EA.

She added: 'We were told on Christmas Eve that the gates were going to be opened and we were going to be flooded.

'By that time we didn't have a hope in hell of getting prepared. They said they would rather sacrifice 1,000 homes here than risk Tonbridge.'

Other villagers said they were given just six minutes warning about the coming flood.

However, an Environment Agency spokesperson denied a decision between Tonbridge and Yalding had been made.

He added: 'Operating the Leigh Barrier to store 5.5million cubic
metres of water protected Tonbridge without having any adverse impact on other
communities.

'Had the barrier not been in operation Kent communities would have
experienced flooding comparable to the devastation in the county during 1968.'

He is referring to the floods which hit large areas of Kent after a deluge of continuous rain. Cars were swept away and people were trapped in their houses. Tonbridge was particularly badly hit.

Flooding fears continue to plague Britain as another band of persistent rain and heavy wind heads towards the UK.

The latest storm pushing in from the Atlantic will arrive in the west this evening before spreading north-eastwards overnight, causing Monday morning disruption.

It will add to the misery of thousands who have been left without power and endured flooded homes over the Christmas period.

Homeowners along the River Medway and Stour are being warned that their properties are at risk of flooding

Some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in England, the Environment Agency said, while flood defences have protected more than 80,000 properties.

It warned the predicted rainfall meant there is a 'continued heightened flood risk' across southern England, especially south west England where river levels remain high and the ground is already saturated.

Large rivers such as the Thames, Severn and Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire are most at risk of flooding, while high water levels on the River Medway and Stour in Kent will cause continued flooding and travel disruption, the EA said.

A Downing Street spokesman said ministers held a COBRA meeting yesterday where it was agreed financial assistance will be given to local authorities facing an undue financial burden because of the storms through a process known as the Bellwin scheme.
