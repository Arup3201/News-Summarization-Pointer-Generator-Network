A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of masterminding a £1.6million cyber raid on cash machines. 

The man is being held by detectives in Portsmouth after the seven-figure haul went missing from a string of ATMs.

Detectives believe an organised crime gang from eastern Europe inserted a computer virus into cash machines in locations including Brighton, London and Liverpool.

Devices in Blackpool, Doncaster and Sheffield were also targeted, City of London Police said.

An address in Edmonton, north London, is also being searched as part of the operation. 

It is not known exactly how the operation worked, but it is thought the criminals cut holes in order to plug in USB drives that installed their code onto the ATMs. 

Detective Inspector Dave Strange said: 'An extensive, intelligence-led investigation has uncovered what we believe is an organised crime gang systematically infecting and then clearing cash machines across the UK using specially created malware.

'Cyber-enabled crime presents a major threat to our public and private sectors and to an increasing number of citizens.

'The only way to tackle this is by law enforcement and counter fraud agencies working in alliance, which is exactly what the London Regional Fraud Team and National Crime Agency (NCA) have done over several months culminating in today's arrest.'

Police believe the cash machines were broken in to and infected with a virus - the gang made £1.6m from the cyber raid as they targeted machines across Britain 

Police allege the cash machines were physically broken into and infected with a virus before large amounts of cash were withdrawn.

It is thought 51 machines were hit over the May Bank Holiday by criminals gaining access to the computer inside the devices and uploading a virus.

Once the malware was activated the machine could be told to dispense large amounts of cash, in some cases until it was drained of money.

Detectives believe the malware subsequently deleted itself, making it difficult to identify the cause of the attacks. Customer data was not compromised, police said.

The man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.
