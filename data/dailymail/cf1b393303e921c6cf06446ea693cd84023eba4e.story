Gary Neville spent Friday night with some of Manchester's finest  as the England assistant  watched The Charlatans at the Albert Hall.

The former Manchester United defender was all smiles as he took time out with Charlatans' lead singer Tim Burgess, Stone Roses legend Mani and Courteeners frontman Liam Fray ahead of the gig.

Tweeting an image of the four Mancunians to Twitter, Burgess joked: 'We need one more for our 5 a-side team'

Neville shared a number of snaps from his seat at the gig and is seemingly a big fan of the 'Madchester' scene

Seemingly a big fan of the 'Madchester' music scene - which was at its height during the late 80s and early 90s - the 40-year-old posted snaps of the gig from his seat.

Neville later posed with Burgess and a signed set-list, saying on Twitter: 'Amazing night with Tim Burgess and The Charlatans.' 

Back in December, Neville shared an image of himself with Courteeners star Fray and wished his beloved Manchester a Merry Christmas.

Burgess, meanwhile, was chuffed to see his band's  song 'Come Home Baby', taken from The Charlatans' latest album Modern Nature, included on the Old Trafford playlist before Manchester United's 2-0 victory over Sunderland last week. 

Stone Roses bassist Mani - real name Gary Mounfield - who also had a spell with Primal Scream, is a staunch Manchester United fan and was at the Nou Camp to see the Red Devils complete the treble and lift the Champions League trophy in 1999.
