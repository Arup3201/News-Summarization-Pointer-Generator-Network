A historic Cadillac built for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor is expected to sell for the princely sum of up to £500,000 after surfacing for the first time in 60 years.

The jet black American car cost a staggering $16,000 (£9,900) when the former King bought it new in 1941.

It was one of the first cars to have electric windows and is decked out with jewellery compartments, cigar lighters, wool carpets and walnut finish.

The King's Cadillac: This car, built for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1941, is set to sell at auction for up to £500,000 after 60 years out of the public eye

The car was nicknamed 'The Duchess' and is one of the world’s most famous Cadillacs.

But after the royals sold the car in 1952, it disappeared from the public only to re-emerge in 2009 when its new owner decided to fully restore it.

He has now decided to sell the Cadillac, described as ‘understated and decidedly European in its elegance,’ at RM Auctions' New York sale next month.

The car is expected to sell for between £360,000 and £500,000 when it goes under the hammer on November.

Treasure trove: The car includes four brushed stainless steel jewellery cases, each lined with velvet, to carry the Duchess' famous extravagant jewellery purchases

The relationship between the Duke and Duchess is regarded as one of the most fascinating and enduring love stories, and one which rocked British society at the time.

In 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated after less than a year on the throne.

He said: ‘You must believe me when I tell you, that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.’

King Edward VII had fallen for American socialite Wallis Simpson and his abdication heralded the beginning of his 35-year international jet-setting lifestyle.While staying in New York, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor would live in a suite at the Waldorf Towers on Park Avenue with the beloved Cadillac their car of choice.

The unique car was upholstered entirely in rose-coloured custom broadcloth, extending to the headlining and sun visors.

Lush limo: The former King was a car enthusiast and enjoyed personally driving the Cadillac and so the front was as luxurious as the back of the car, a rarity for a limousine

Historic design: The car is an 'an exceptionally important part of both automotive and social history,' said Alain Squindo, vice president of RM Auctions. He called it a 'design statement unlike any other to come from Detroit in those years'

Craftsmen covered the floors in Wilton wool carpet, custom-dyed to match and set against custom walnut finishes for the doors, cabinetry and divider window.

It was one of the first two Cadillacs to be equipped with electric windows and was fitted with satin privacy curtains which would roll away when not in use.

Other luxuries included four brushed stainless-steel jewellery cases, each lined in velvet, to carry the Duchess' famous jewellery purchases.

The Duke had three cigar lighters and two ashtrays, along with a humidor and custom rack for his favoured Sasieni pipes.

As a car enthusiast, the Duke - also known as Prince Edward - would drive the Cadillac personally so the front was as luxurious as the rear, a rarity for a limousine.

Characterized the couple: Leslie Keno, a senior international specialist at Sotheby's said the 'grace and elegance' of this historic car reflected the uniqueness of the regal couple who originally owned it

After selling the car it was thought it was later destroyed when it disappeared from the public eye, but it was actually living a quiet life in Springfield.

The Cadillac was then sold to a Texan in 1964 who stored it until 2009 when the current owner bought it and fully restored it.

It is being sold without a reserve by RM Auctions and Sotheby's in New York.

Alain Squindo, vice president, RM Auctions, said: ‘This Cadillac is an exceptionally important part of both automotive and social history and it is particularly appropriate that the car should be offered for sale in New York, the city to which it was delivered new and in which it has not been seen in many years.

‘From front to back and throughout the entire interior, it is a design statement unlike any other to come from Detroit in those years.’

Leslie Keno, senior international specialist from Sotheby's, said: ‘Much like the record-setting emerald-eyed panther bracelet sold at the final Sotheby's auction of the Duke and Duchess' collections, this Cadillac is the pinnacle of design.

‘It is emblematic not only of the grace and elegance that characterized the couple, but it is a truly bespoke piece, befitting its regal owners.’
