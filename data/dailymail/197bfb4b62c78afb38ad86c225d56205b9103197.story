With viewing figures of almost 
10 million every week, ITV's 
charming period drama Downton Abbey has been one of the most popular shows to grace our screens.

And it seems that a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans who are so enamoured with the upstairs/downstairs lives of
the 1920s characters that they want to emulate them too.

Fashion brands have reported increased interest in retro flapper style dresses and demure ruffled blouses as well as vintage nightwear and sharp tailored men's suits.

And now, the series, which is set to be screened again later this year, has inspired a vintage wine collection.

Downton drinking style: The hit ITV series has inspired a 'vintage' wine collection that producers say the cast would be proud of

French blends imported by the British aristocracy in the early 1900s, like the Crawleys, are set to be to be recreated.

The range of Bordeaux clarets and whites will come from grapes grown on the same vines and from the same soil as the era depicted in the popular show.

Wines That Rock, a company that already produces the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd-branded wine, will be producing the wine in collaboration with Dulong Grands Vins de Bordeaux, a 130-year-old wine-making business.

Speaking about the collaboration, Wines That Rock co-owner Bill Zysblat said: 'We are working with The Dulong Grands Vins De Bordeaux vineyards, which
 have been in the same family for five generations.

'They have over 130 
years of experience in creating the world’s best wines so these are 
wines the Crawley family would have been proud to serve at Downton.'

In a very un-British fashion, however, the wine will only be sold in the U.S. and Canada, where the show's finale reached an average of 12.3 million viewers, with the entire third series averaging 11.5 million viewers.

Stateside hit: There is no official release date for the wine but it's believed that it will coincide with the airing of season 4 in the U.S., where it is viewed by 24 million people

It has become the highest-rating TV drama in PBS's history, reaching over 24 million viewers overall.

The Emmy and Golden Globe-winning drama, which debuted on British screens back in September 2010, is now shown in over 200 countries to 120 million viewers worldwide.

An official release date for the wine has not been revealed, but it’s believed that it will hit shelves across the US and Canada in time for the fourth season and will be available as individual bottles or gift sets.
