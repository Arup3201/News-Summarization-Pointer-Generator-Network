American parents are seeing double more than ever before with one in every 30 babies born as a twin.

The twin birth rate in the United States rose by 76 percent in 2009 since 1980, when only one in 53 babies was a twin, according to a government report published today (Wednesday).

Experts are attributing the astounding increase to older mothers and fertility treatments.

'When people say it seems like you see more twins nowadays, they're right,'said Joyce Martin, an epidemiologist who co-authored the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.

Some increase was expected as more women are waiting until they are over 30 to have babies.

For some unknown reason, mothers in their 30s are more likely to have twins than younger or older women.

As much as a third of the increase can be attributed to that, Martin said.

The rest of the rise is due to fertility drugs and treatments, experts said.

'You have a double whammy going on. There are more older moms and more widespread use of fertility-enhancing therapies,' Martin said.

Starting in the early 1980s, couples who had trouble conceiving began to benefit from medical advances like fertility drugs and in vitro fertilization and other procedures.

These treatments became fairly widespread in the 1990s but are expensive, and availability and insurance coverage varies.

The twin birth rate rose by more than two percent a year, on average, from 1980 through 2004.

It leveled off to less than one percent annually although the rise from 2008 to 2009 was nearly two percent.

In 2009, twin rates increased in all 50 states, though the jumps were highest in lower New England, New Jersey and Hawaii.

In Connecticut, twins now account for nearly five percent of births, where nationally, 3.3 percent of all births were twins in 2009, up from two percent in 1980.

• In 2009, 1 in every 30 babies born in the United States was a twin, compared with 1 in every 53 babies in 1980.

• The twin birth rate rose 76 percent from 1980 through TO 2009, from 18.9 to 33.3 per 1,000 births.

• If the rate of twin births had not changed since 1980, approximately 865,000 fewer twins would have been born over the last three decades.

• Twinning rates rose by at least 50 percent in the vast majority of states and the District of Columbia.

• Twin birth rates rose by nearly 100 percent among women aged 35–39 and more than 200 percent among women aged 40 and over.

•The older age of women at childbirth in 2009 compared with 1980 accounts for one-third of the rise in twinning over the 30 years.

Over the last three decades, rates rose for white, black and Hispanic women, but the increases were not uniform.

Rates doubled for whites, rose by half for blacks and by about a third for Hispanics.

Historically, black mothers have twins most often, but white mums have almost caught up.

'That's changed with infertility treatments,' said Barbara Luke, a Michigan State University expert on twin births.

The greatest increase in twin rates was for women 40 and older.

They
are more likely to use fertility treatments and to have two embryos 
implanted during in vitro fertilization, whereas younger women are more 
likely to get just one.

About seven percent of all births for women 40 and older were twins, compared to five percent of women in their late 30s and two percent of women age 24 or younger.

While a lot of attention is focused on the impact of fertility treatments, that's not the only factor.

Before
fertility treatments existed, about 2.5 percent of the babies born to 
women in their late 30s were twins, compared to under two percent for 
younger and older women.

Some research has suggested women in that age group are more likely to produce multiple eggs in a cycle, increasing their chances of twins.

In 2009, twin rates increased in all 50 states, though the jumps were highest in lower New England, New Jersey and Hawaii

Clearly, there are more older mothers. In recent years, more than a third of all births are to women 30 and older, up from just one-fifth in 1980.

Some experts say the trend is worrisome, noting that multiple births are more dangerous for the mother and their babies.

The infants tend to be born earlier, smaller and weaker, and require much more care.

But for some older women worried about conceiving, 'having twins is a blessing,' Luke added.
