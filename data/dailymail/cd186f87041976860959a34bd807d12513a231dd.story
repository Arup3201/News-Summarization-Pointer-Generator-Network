Builder Lee Slocombe (pictured), 32, who defrauded his victims out of £43,000 has been jailed for more than three years

A 'cowboy builder' who conned his victims out of £43,000 when he left their homes 'ripped to pieces' has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

A court heard how Lee Slocombe, 32, from Pontypridd, south Wales, started work on properties but then demolished the houses and asked for more money to complete the jobs. 

But he never paid the cash back leaving families out of pocket and with homes that required extensive renovation.   

Among his victims were PC James Gardner, 32, and Sheri Hall, 24, who hired the builder to undertake some minor work at their new home in Aberbeeg, Blaenau Gwent.

Miss Hall, a PR account executive at Golley Slater Wales, told MailOnline: 'The builder was recommended to us and so we had him round for a quote for re-decoration. He also said he could put in an extended kitchen out the back of the house as well.

'He said he could do the job using leftover spare materials.

'Because it was quite a lot of major work to the main area of the house, James (who was already living in the house) moved out to live with his mum in Cardiff. 

'We popped round to see how it was getting on. But because we were not living there at the time, it was hard to see what was going on.

'He was slowly demolishing the house but it looked like lots of work had been done. We didn't really know what was happening.'

Among his victims were Sheri Hall, 24, and PC James Gardner, 32 - the builder demolished their new home

The couple were left devastated when Slocombe left their home in Aberbeeg, Blaenau Gwent, ruined 

When the couple returned to their cottage they found their floorboards lying in the back garden

Miss Hall, 24, and PC Gardner, 32, had been dating for a year when they moved in to the house together

In fact, Slocombe had gone round their house damaging the ceilings, interior walls and floors.

He had left the couple without a staircase or radiators and when they returned to the house they found their floorboards lying in the back garden and had to negotiate a four-foot drop into rubble to get into the front door.

Miss Hall added: 'He then started saying there were bigger problems with the house, saying there was chronic damp and claimed he needed double the money to fix it.

'He said if he didn't have the money he wouldn't get the job done. We didn't want to aggravate him too much as he had our money.'

The couple had paid the 'cowboy builder' around £14,000 before he disappeared. 

'We couldn't get hold of him,' said Miss Hall. 'James sent text messages begging, saying "please, please, please where are you?"

'There was nothing he could do – he had no money left – the family had no money left because they had lent it to him.'

When Slocombe did eventually text back his excuse staggered the couple.

'He replied to say he didn't have the money but would pay us back because he was expecting a lot of money from compensation because his testicle was cut off.'

A court heard how Slocombe would ask for more and more cash in order to complete the job, claiming in some instances the work was more complex than he had originally thought

Following a call to Cowboy Builders, the Channel 5 show, the couple finally had their cottage renovated 

Two rogue builders who ripped off pensioners for £100,000 for bodged and unnecessary work have been jailed.

Serial offender Nelson Richards, 51, was jailed for five years and his brother in law Johnny Jones for three-and-a-half years at Truro Crown Court. 

The average age of their victims was 75 and the oldest was an 89-year-old woman who lived alone.

In one case, an 83-year-old woman forked out £18,000 on work that did not need doing. The two men drove her to Falmouth to take the cash out of her bank. 

Richards was jailed in 2006 for defrauding people out of £600,000 but within weeks of being released from jail, he was conning new victims.

Judge Simon Carr said the pair, from Tregajorran near Redruth, west Cornwall, 'deliberately targeted vulnerable people' 

At that point, Miss Hall convinced her boyfriend the builder was not going to fix their house and so contacted Cowboy Builders, the television programme aimed at exposing rogues. 

They helped restore their cottage and also expose Slocombe, which led to the police getting involved.  

In Newport Crown Court this week prosecutor Claire Pickthall described Slocombe as having told 'barefaced lies' to his victims.

He would ask for more and more cash in order to complete the job, claiming in some instances the work was more complex than he had originally thought.

Ms Pickthall said: 'The defendant kept saying to one victim that they had invested so much that if they didn't continue they would lose everything.'

She said Slocombe even asked for money towards his grandmother's funeral.

He was handed a 43-month sentence, having pleading guilty to defrauding one family of £26,000, another of £13,450 and a third of £4,000.

In a statement read to the court, Marie Lancaster, the wife of another victim, said: 'Our once-happy carefree life has gone. We are left with a mountain of debt. We will be struggling with for a very long time.'  

Elsewhere, PC Gardner is still paying back his relatives, left out of pocket by Slocombe.

They think his prison sentence was 'a really, really good result'.

Miss Hall said: 'He doesn't even show any remorse at all.

'I don't think he could actually comprehend what he did to us. People like that almost think because it's not a violent crime it's not an assault, they seem to think of it as lesser crime.

'He's the type of person who wouldn't realise what damage it does.'
