A crackling, heating potion claims to beat cellulite faster than any other.

Fisioline, the 'number one' cellulite treatment amongst Italian women, boasts revolutionary crackle technology which sparks and fizzes on contact with skin, warming it to a 'pleasant but significant' temperature.

This, along with a lymphatic massage, is said to enhance the activity of the £25 product's multiple active cellulite-targetting ingredients.

Cellulite is a problem for many women but Italian company Fisioline claims to have the answer

Chilli
 pepper extract features in the formula to reactivate microcirculation 
while ivy, birch, asiatic centella aid lymphatic draining.  There's also 
antioxidant green tea and smoothing and soothing aloe, as well as 
carnitin, brown algae, theobromine, bromelain, caffeine and genistein 
which are known to work to stimulate the metabolism.

The strange bubbling sensation occurs because active ingredients are getting to work straight away.

Commissioned research has shown that daily use of the Fisioline product leads to a 'significant improvement in the appearance of the skin' in just three weeks.

Private healthcare search engine, WhatClinic.com, found patient enquiries for cellulite treatments in the UK have risen by 21 per cent in the last 12 months, so the product definitely has a growing market in this country.

The feeling of the product is addictive, like warming popping candy against your skin. But that shouldn't be the only reason to love it, as there's science behind the formula.

The University of Ferrara found that cellulite creams and gels only start working five to seven minutes after application - providing you're still working it into the skin.

Studies have found though, that we rarely massage product into offending areas for more than a mere three minutes - hence we are not getting the maximum benefits.

However, thanks to Fisioline's crackle technology, the product's maximum potential is realised within the first five minutes when active ingredients are working at their peak.

The crackling effect warms the skin to a pleasant but significant temperature which enhances the activity of the active ingredients in the epidermis within the very first minutes of application.

Absorption and effect is optimised further thanks to the physical action of massage.

Beating the bumps: massaging the area could help the cream be absorbed quicker into the skin

Dr Susanna Hayter (MB BS BSc pharmacology) is a specialist in aesthetic medicine and clinical director of My Beauty Doctor Ltd where they offer non surgical body contouring and cellulite treatments.

'I'm not at all surprised by the increase in number of people wanting treatment for their cellulite. My clinic has seen an upsurge in women wanting treatment for stubborn fat and cellulite in the last year,' she says.

'Most of them have tried unsuccessfully to treat their cellulite with various creams and brushes but have not seen significant results so they come to me for something more radical.

'Cellulite is disordered fat so it's not as simple as just loosing weight to get rid of it. The problem is lack of lymphatic drainage to any area where there are localised deposits of fat cells and this lack of drainage leads to failure of removal of fluids from the affected tissue resulting in the characteristic peau d'orange (orange peel) appearance.

'With cellulite the fat cells are encapsulated in a connective tissue matrix and to successfully to treat it you need to break down the fibrous matrix but also improve blood supply and lymphatic drainage to the area.

'I don't believe that creams applied to the skin surface have sufficient penetration to start to breakdown this matrix or improve the circulation.

'However anything that stimulates the lymphatic drainage could lead to visible results.'

Body-brushing is one of the best ways to
stimulate circulation, thus making skin look brighter and smoother, 
draining toxins, diminishing cellulite and banishing mottled skin.

Macpherson Rotating Dry Brush for HoMedics, £39.99 from Boots, uses 
natural bristles to massage skin gently but effectively.
