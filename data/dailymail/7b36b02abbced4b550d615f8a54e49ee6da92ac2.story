Wenger has been re-invigorated after watching his team beat Hull City in Saturday’s FA Cup final - the fifth time he has lifted the trophy as Arsenal boss - and will now stay at the Emirates.

Asked if the new deal would be signed soon, he said: ‘Yes - because I go to Brazil on June 10.’

The length of the deal is viewed as a significant statement of unwavering support from the club’s hierarchy. And they will also give Wenger the all clear to go on an unprecedented spending spree this summer to ensure the club build upon their FA Cup success.

Wenger will have £100m to spend on transfers and wages. His priority is to convince full-back Bacary Sagna and keeper Lukasz Fabianski to stay at the club, but the Arsenal manager has also identified three key areas to strengthen this summer. He wants a new striker, a holding centre-midfielder and a right-back.

Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema are among Wenger’s top striker targets.

Bayer Leverkusen’s Lars Bender and Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin are midfielders who have been watched extensively by the Gunners scouts, while Toulouse’s Serge Aurier, Southampton’s Calum Chambers and Manchester City’s Micah Richards are right-back options should Sagna depart.

Wenger said: ‘First we have to wait for Sagna and see what he will do - also Fabianski. After we have to bring in two to three players to strengthen the squad, that’s for sure.

‘Unfortunately everywhere we go there are many teams on the market at the moment.’

Sagna’s contract expires next month and he will hold talks with Manchester City this week over a four-year deal worth at least £100,000-per-week.

However, as MailOnline exclusively revealed on Saturday, Manchester United are keen to hijack City’s move for the right-back.

Arsenal’s
 triumph on Saturday was Wenger’s first trophy since Patrick Vieira 
struck the winning spot kick in a penalty shootout against Manchester 
United in the 2005 FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium.

He admitted: ‘I questioned myself because we live in a world where people always tell you what you haven’t done. They never say what you have done.

‘I believe as well that the quality of the club is its consistency. The special players help you to win trophies, but the quality of consistency is important for a club.

‘And on that front, we’ve been better than everybody. There are only two clubs in Europe who have qualified for the Champions League for 17 seasons consecutively.

‘That consistency demands special values inside the club. I work seven days a week because I want to win. It’s difficult. ‘Unfortunately you don’t win on command. Our job is very easy when we win things. When we don’t win, we need some strength to continue to grow.

‘Some clubs haven’t won a trophy for 20 years and they don’t get that question.

‘This is my 14th cup final and I fight very hard to win, doing everything every day of my life to try to win. If I don’t manage to do it, it’s not because of a lack of commitment. I try my best.’
