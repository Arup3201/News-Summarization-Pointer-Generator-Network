It seems the true meaning of Christmas really is being lost - with one in five children now believing Jesus Christ is a footballer for Chelsea FC.

A new study also shows that 52 per cent of youngsters aged five to 12 think Christmas is Santa Claus' birthday.

The nativity story appears to cause confusion for most, with 35 per cent believing Jesus was born in the South Pole and 27 per cent thinking Mary gave birth in a church.

Meanwhile, 10 per cent insist Rudolph the reindeer was in the stable at the time.

The study of 1,000 youngsters, by Brent Cross shopping centre, reveals British children now struggle with the basics of the traditional Christmas story and instead believe the festive period is just about Santa and receiving gifts.

It seems the birth of Jesus is not the only element of the nativity scene causing confusion.

A quarter (25 per cent) now believe the shepherds found Jesus using Google Maps and 15 per cent claim the Three Kings gave Jesus a wand, tiara and wings as gifts to celebrate his birth.

Among those who don't believe Jesus is a Chelsea striker, some believe he is an astronaut and others an X Factor contestant.

To ensure children understand the true meaning of Christmas, Brent Cross shopping centre will be putting nativity knowledge to the test outside its grotto this December.

Prior to seeing Santa, visitors will be quizzed on a series of festive issues to demonstrate the day is about more than mince pies and presents.

Katie Tucker, Marketing Manager at Brent Cross, said: 'With children looking forward to the festive season the whole year round, we wanted to ensure the true meaning of celebration was understood.

'Hopefully, by proving to the kids at Brent Cross that Jesus Christ isn't a footballer they will fully appreciate the season of celebration and enjoy it even more.'
