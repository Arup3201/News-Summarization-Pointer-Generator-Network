A mother-of-two suffered severe burns and painful blisters on her face and chest after applying fake blood as the finishing touches to a Halloween costume.

Victoria Eaton, from north Yorkshire, noticed a white foam fizzing from her skin within 30 minutes as a burning sensation seared across her chest and face and her skin began to peel.

Today the 46-year-old is urging parents to be vigilant when buying any face paints or novelty cosmetic products for their children this Halloween.

Following an investigation into the product Mrs Eaton bought online, it emerged the fake blood was untested and defective.

Victoria Eaton, pictured with her son Russell, 10, has been awarded nearly £2,000 compensation after fake blood she applied as part of her Halloween costume caused burns to her skin

She was awarded £1,987 in compensation. 

Mrs Eaton said: 'The fake blood quickly caused a burning sensation, it was incredibly painful and became very itchy.

'Despite receiving treatment at A&E, I was left with blistering and redness which lasted for weeks.

'It was a really difficult time and the incident had a real impact on my everyday life. 

'I had to cover my face and chest with a scarf at work during this period - it was very embarrassing and I became very self-conscious.  

'What's worse is that I had offered to put some of the fake blood on my son for his costume. 

'He happened to say that he didn't want any, but I dread to think what would have happened had he said "yes".'

Mrs Eaton is urging all parents to check the fine print on these sorts of products and to buy them from reputable suppliers, rather than online, 

Within 30 minutes of applying the fake blood, which she bought online, she noticed a white foam and a burning sensation searing across her chest and chin

She was left with painful blistering and scars that left her feeling self-conscious for months. She is today urging parents to be vigilant when buying face paints and other novelty cosmetics for Halloween

She added: 'I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through.'

Catherine Reynolds at Thompsons Solicitors who represented the mother-of-two, said: 'Victoria's case is a Halloween horror story come true and underlines the dangers that are present for parents buying products online. 

'We need tighter rules to stop the sale of untested products that come into the UK via import.

'Victoria's injuries could have been prevented if the product in question had been properly tested and the defect detected before it was put into circulation.'
