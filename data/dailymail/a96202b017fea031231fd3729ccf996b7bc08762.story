This photo is guaranteed to send you quackers - its a beautiful orchid that looks like Daffy Duck.

Taken in a rare moment of tranquillity in Tasmania, the orchid bears a striking resemblance to the Looney Tunes hero.

Scottish photographer Bill Higham, 44, was on the sandy Australian heathland when he snapped the flower.

So well-known for its similarities to the charismatic duck's yellow bill and black head, the orchid is known as the Flying Duck.

Daffy Duck appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, where he usually has been depicted as the best friend and occasional arch-rival of Bugs Bunny.

Daffy emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye.

Daffy Duck is one of the most popular members of the Looney Toons family, being the third-most frequently appearing cartoon character in the famous shorts

Daffy starred in golden age 133 shorts, making him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny's 166 appearances and Porky Pig's 159 appearances.

Daffy first appeared in Porky's Duck Hunt, released on April 17, 1937, and directed by Tex Avery and animated by Bob Clampett.

The orchid, indigenous to Tasmania, is known for its resemblance to the cartoon character to the point that it is named 'The Flying Duck'

The only aspects of the character that have stayed the same through the years are his voice characterization by Mel Blanc and his black feathers with a white neck ring.

Blanc's characterization of Daffy holds the world record for the longest characterisation of one animated character by the original actor at 52 years.
