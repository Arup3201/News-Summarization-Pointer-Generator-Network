A young girl with a rare form of cancer, who charmed the Duchess of Cambridge when presenting her with a bouquet of flowers and a heartfelt hug on a 2011 visit to Canada, has died.

Diamond Marshall was six years old when she caught the world's attention during Kate Middleton and Prince William’s visit to Calgary.

The girl had wanted to meet a princess after watching the royal couple’s wedding earlier that year from her hospital bed, a dream that was made possible by the Children's Wish Foundation.

Diamond Marshall was six years old when she caught the world's attention during Kate Middleton and Prince William’s visit to Calgary in July 2011.

Diamond had been diagnosed with a rare childhood cancer that affects the body's soft tissues. It had been in remission, but recently returned and she died peacefully in her sleep on Monday

Kate may be a duchess, rather than a princess, but the distinction hardly mattered to Diamond, who presented her with a colorful bouquet of flowers, a homemade heart-shaped trinket box.

She had made a big impact on the Duchess after running up to her and flinging her arms around her neck.

A spokesperson from Buckingham Palace said the royal couple were saddened to learn of her death, reports CBC.

Diamond had been diagnosed with undifferentiated sarcoma, a rare childhood cancer that affects the body's soft tissues. It had been in remission, but recently returned.

‘[She] had survived cancer three times previously, but in early November we discovered she had osteosarcoma and we were told this would be the last chapter of her journey,’ said her family in a statement.

Diamond died peacefully on Monday evening. Her family said they were sad, but also relieved that she is no longer suffering.

‘We are incredibly thankful for the time we had with Diamond and we will cherish the memories we made with her,’ said the statement.

‘In her fight against cancer, Diamond was a warrior but she carried herself with the grace and dignity of a princess. She touched many people along the way and her story inspired so many.’

Her family plan to set up a charitable initiative in Diamond's memory in the near future.
