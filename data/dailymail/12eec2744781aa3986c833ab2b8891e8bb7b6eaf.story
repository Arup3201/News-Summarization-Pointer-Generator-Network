From leopard-print to fishnet, the creative brains behind ultra-hip New York denim label Current/Elliot aren't shy of using a statement print or two.

And with the military trend hitting the headlines this season, it's no surprise the brand's latest offering features a chic camouflage print.

Long time Current/Elliott fan Sarah Jessica Parker has already been spotted out and about in the grey and khaki print jeans, while actress Portia de Rossi also has a pair.

Camo queen: Sarah Jessica Parker, pictured with son James Wilkie Broderick, works the military look while out for a stroll in New York.

Military madams: Actress Portia de Rossi, left, and singer Rihanna, right, both love Current/Elliot's camouflage prints.

Parker, seen wearing hers on a relaxing September stroll in New York with her son James Wilkie Broderick, 10, teamed the jeans with a casual pale green striped T-shirt, comfy ballet flats and a large leather satchel.

De Rossi chose to wear hers with a simple black vest, black flip-flops and dark glasses.

Other celebrities spotted getting to grips with the camouflage trend include singers Rihanna - regularly seen in her beloved khaki camo shirt - Rita Ora, Mary J Blige and Miley Cyrus, all of whom have been snapped in camouflage jackets.

Splatter chic: Olivia Palermo, left, and Pink, right with baby Willow, have proved themselves fans of colourful splatter-print and patterned denim.

But camouflage isn't the only print to adorn this season's jeans. While summer saw floral prints and coloured denim take centre stage, this autumn it's all about animal, graphic and digital prints.

Denim darling: Miranda Kerr steps out in New York wearing blue, cheetah-print jeans.

Never one to be left behind, the ever-stylish Miranda Kerr was seen out in subtle dark blue cheetah print.

Fashionista Olivia Palermo teamed a pair of bright pink and purple splatter print jeans with a pair of chic silver flats.

Even singer Pink has been getting in on the act and was seen out playing with her daughter Willow while sporting a pair of garish Balmain baroque print jeans.

One of autumn's hottest trends, 
camouflage print and military influences were seen all over the 
catwalks.

The look reigned at Burberry and Jason Wu, and popped up at 
Belstaff, Alexander Wang and Victoria Beckham among others.

On the high street, Michelle Obama's 
favourite J Crew has a pared-down khaki watch for £150 (jcrew.com), 
while Topshop has an entire collection dedicated to the trend.

This season's Unique offering includes 
khaki lace-up boots with stiletto heels for £150, a delicate U-print 
shirt dress for £90 and a striking olive wool military great coat for 
£350 (all from topshop.com).

Elsewhere, online retailer ASOS has a brilliant belted military coat in khaki for £110 (asos.com), which would work beautifully with River Island's practical black leather boots, £75 (riverisland.com).

Easier still, go vintage and head to
a military surplus store, where you can snap up the look for a fraction
of the designer price.

Also worth checking out is East London vintage 
emporium Rokit (rokit.co.uk), which boasts rail after rail crammed with military 
pieces sourced from army outfitters.

Current/Elliott Multi Zip Stiletto Skinny jeans, £220, are available from Donna Ida.
