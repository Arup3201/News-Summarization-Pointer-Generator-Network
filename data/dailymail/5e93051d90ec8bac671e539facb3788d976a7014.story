Politics? Russian media tycoon Alexander Lebedev, whose prosecution was signed off by a former classmate of President Vladimir Putin

The controversial criminal prosecution of newspaper owner Alexander Lebedev was started by a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, it was claimed at the newspaper owner's trial.

A document in the case file records shows that the probe was demanded by Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of the powerful Investigative Committee, known as the Russian FBI, said a Lebedev lawyer.

The media magnate is accused of the draconian offence of hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' in lashing out at property mogul Sergei Polonsky during a heated TV debate.

The revelation comes as a lawyer for Polonsky predicted to a Russian journalist that Lebedev will be jailed next week for three years. The maximum penalty is five years. 

The court file refers to 'an order' from Bastrykin 'to investigate the circumstances of Polonsky being beaten' during the television show.

In a demand relayed via a subordinate, his order was to  'establish objectively all the circumstances of the incident' and 'submit a draft decision to start criminal proceedings under article 213 of the Criminal Code'.

A day later Polonsky signed an application to start criminal proceedings in the case. 

Lebedev's lawyer Genri Reznik expressed concern in court that Bastrykin had ordered the supposedly objective probe at the same time as calling for the start of criminal proceedings under the draconian power. 

The same criminal charge was used last year to jail two singers from punk group Pussy Riot after a protest against Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.

Bastrykin is Russia's top law enforcement chief and studied at Leningrad State University in the same class as Putin.

Judge Andrey Bakhvalov announced today that he will personally interrogate the tycoon in a court session on Thursday after which closing arguments from prosecutors and defence lawyers are expected. 

A verdict is then expected by Wednesday next week, according to court sources.

Lebedev, 53, owns investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta in Russia and his family controls the London Evening Standard and The Independent titles.

His legal team have denied the 'punches' even made contact with Polonsky and insist there was no political malice.

The Kremlin has denied that Putin interferes with the independence of the judiciary despite claims this prosecution is politically motivated by Lebedev's ownership of Novaya Gazeta.

Polonsky has been absent from a trial which has been dubbed 'farcical' after it was claimed by his legal team that he is in Cambodia on bail and cannot leave the country. 

However, images of him surfaced in Tel Aviv and one lawyer has admitted she is seeking asylum for him in Israel.

Prosecution witnesses included people who watched the show on TV. One was recruited randomly when she stepped off a bus in central Moscow.

Lebedev has said he is 'steeling' himself for jail despite insisting he is not guilty of the hooliganism charge.

Polonsky lawyer Alexander Dobrovinsky said Lebedev was likely to be jailed for three years, according to a Novaya Gazeta report.

The paper has questioned whether the verdict is already set before the trial is over.

Analysts say the case raises issues of press freedom amid claims the state is using draconian powers to gag a newspaper proprietor.

'I don't want to criticise our legal system, I am satisfied with the way it treats me,' said Lebedev recently.

'I am not exactly enjoying this but it is all new experience for me. Remember that the judge is the part of the system, and won't go against it.

'Don't say Kremlin is after me, it is all about the machinery. Once they started the engine and began all this against me, they must go on, it is just a big and heavy machine.'
