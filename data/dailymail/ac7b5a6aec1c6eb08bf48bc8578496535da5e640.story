Job interviews must be a riot with this freaky fellow - and no, that's not a mask he's wearing (you ought to see him first thing in the morning).

Meet the terrifying Devil Man of Colombia who proudly sports black tattooed eyeballs, multiple horn implants and more piercings than a sewing machine convention on steroids.

Caim Mortis is one guy who won't need to get dressed up to go trick or treating this Halloween - but whether you'd want him banging on your front door asking for sweets is another matter entirely.

Hell boy: Caim Mortis the 'Devil Man of Colombia'  proudly sports black tattooed eyeballs, multiple horn implants and  piercings

The 42-year-old has spent 11 years modifying his body including having his eyeballs tattooed completely black, horn-like dermal implants put into his forehead and forearms and a horn piercing.

As a result of his menacing body overhaul Caim's devout Catholic family rejected him and he moved from Colombia to Mexico where people are more accepting.

Caim said: 'When people first see me their normal reaction is to be shocked or amazed.

Sensitive side: 42-year-old Caim Mortis has spent 11 years modifying his body - with dramatic results

'The first thing they ask me is "does it hurt?" or "who did this to you?"

'One of the key motivations for my own body modifications has been to be unique and different compared to others in the world.

'Body modification culture has been around for ages, it is not just a fashion or a temporary fad although people presume it is.'

Like Caim, lots of people want to stand out from the crowd, and he helps them in his jobs as a tattoo artists and body painter.

Fittingly, he is launching his new career as a DJ this Halloween and is touring with another DJ, Gisella, who will play the part of an 'Angel' to his devil on stage.

Caim said: 'I have always been heavily into music, especially Latin styles, EDM and world fusion and I have been training as a DJ for many months.

'I am excited to bring this unique concept and theme and people will definitely enjoy our show.'
