A woman and her family lured her estranged husband to their home by offering to let him see his kids - before beating and shooting him to death as he tried to run away, police have said.

John Michael Ferrell, 51, was killed at the home in Simpsonville, South Carolina on Saturday night amid a custody battle with the mother of his children, Jane Hughes, 33.

Hughes has now been arrested along with her boyfriend, Andrew Martin, 37, brother Jacob Hughes, 29, father John Hughes, 57, and mother Margaret Hughes, 55. All are charged with murder.

Police say that Jacob Hughes set the plan in motion by inviting Ferrell out for drinks at a bar and food at a Waffle House on Saturday before offering to take him to the house to see his children.

Ferrell had previously written on his Facebook page how rarely he saw his children. He was able to see them in November after being apart from them for a year, he said.

They left the Waffle House at 11.23pm and headed towards to the house. Not long after arriving at the home, Ferrell was struck in the head with a hammer, police said.

He tried to climb through a six-foot high kitchen window but either his pants got caught on a nail or people inside pulled them down trying to prevent him from escaping, police said.

'He was hindered by his pants that were down around his ankles, preventing him from fleeing, in addition to the trauma from being struck in the head multiple times with the hammer,' said Keith Grounsell, police chief in Simpsonville, a suburb of about 20,000 people just south of Greenville. 

John Hughes then took aim and fired at Ferrell, who was found dead 12 feet from the kitchen window in the front yard, Grounsell said.

Arrested: Her brother Jacob, left, met Ferrell for a drink before taking him back to the house by offering to let him see his kids. Once there, the man was attacked by her family and boyfriend, Andrew Martin, right

Family plot: Her father John Hughes, 57, left, shot Ferrell as he escaped the home but claimed it was because the man was breaking in. His wife Margaret Hughes, 55, right, was also arrested by authorities

He had been shot five times with a .45-caliber handgun and had been assaulted in the head and body with a hammer, authorities said.

The Greenville County Coroner said that Ferrell suffered from blunt force trauma to the body as well as multiple gunshot wounds, and the death was ruled as a homicide.

Before his arrest, John Hughes told WYFF-TV that Ferrell was trying to break in through the window and that he feared for their lives so he shot him.

'I killed my son-in-law,' he said. 'That's horrible enough. But the fact I have to somehow tell my grandchildren that I killed their father - that might be more than I can take.' 

Grounsell said forensic investigators found evidence of blood throughout the kitchen that was cleaned before police arrived Saturday night, and no one in the family mentioned any fight in that room.

Heartbreaking: Ferrell posted this message beside a photo of him with his daughter in November last year, expressing his sadness over the time he had lost with his children

Loving: On Facebook, the father had written of his sadness that he did not get to see his children more often

Court records show that Jane Hughes and Ferrell were going through a contentious divorce and child custody dispute, WHNS-TV reported.

Ferrell told officials that John Hughes told him taking his granddaughter would be the last thing he ever did. John Hughes told the court his son-in-law abused the children.

A judge had issued a restraining order against the Hughes and Ferrell, according to WHNS-TV.

The deceased man's family paid tribute to him on Facebook and shared photos of him with his young children.

'Never know if you'll get another chance to talk to someone. RIP Dad,' his grown son, Brad, wrote. 

He added: 'Really appreciate the quick and efficient work by the Simpsonville police department. It means a lot.'
