 

Swinging might not be the obvious way to spread the word about religion but for Cristy and Dean Parave, from Florida, it is ideal.

The couple, both of whom are devoted Christians, have even set up a website called FitnessSwingers.com which enables them to meet couples who, like them, are both religious and fans of keeping fit.

But not everyone who asks to meet them is Christian and so the undecided and atheist are given a gentle lesson in faith along with a good time between the sheets.

'I don't think God would be mad at what we are doing,' smiles Mrs Parave, 44. 'At first I was conflicted but the more we looked at it the more it makes sense to us.

'Dean and I are both in agreement with this lifestyle, so we're not committing adultery. God put people on the earth to breed and enjoy each other - I feel God is always with me and he has put us here for a reason.'

The couple met on a dating website eight years ago, after Mrs Parave, who has three children from a former marriage, Brittany, 23, Daryl, 20, and 17-year-old Rose, decided to start meeting people again following the end of her relationship.

Mr Parave, a fitness instructor, had been an alcoholic and drug addict before finding Jesus following a drink-drive arrest.

'For me every day used to involve a case of beer and a bottle of Jack Daniels,' he remembers. 'After my fifth arrest for driving under the influence I begged God for help.

'I should have been looking at 10 years but the judge sentenced me to just 10 months in prison - for me that was a sign.'

After he was released Mr Parave built a 40ft cross in his back yard and pledged to do the Lord's work for the rest of his life. 

Despite their past difficulties, the pair quickly hit it off. But it was in bed that the real fireworks took place, with the 44-year-old admitting that her first husband wasn't quite as compatible.

'I've always been adventurous when it comes to sex,' she says, candidly. 'The sex between my first husband and I was miserable.

'I was undersexed before I met Dean but now we do it twice a day. It's incredible.'

Despite their penchant for twice-a-day sex, their antics would have stayed behind closed doors, had it not been for a chance meeting in a supermarket.

'A couple approached me in Home Depot out of nowhere and asked if we were swingers,' remembers Mrs Parave.

'I was so naive I thought they were talking about swing dancing. I said, "I used to love to but my husband doesn't, I'd love to get him lessons". Afterwards we went home and looked it up online and it sounded exciting.'

Inspired, Mrs Parave invited a friend over a few days later and the two women surprised her husband in the shower.

'I had a very sexually adventurous friend who knew about swinging. I asked her if she wanted to try with Dean and I,' she explains.

Getting close: According to Mr Parave, having sex with someone is by far the best way to get close to them

'Dean didn't know what was happening, he thought it was a trick and I was trying to catch him out.'

Two years ago they set up their website and now travel around the US, meeting people within the swinging community.

'Both our parents know about it and they are happy for us,' adds Mrs Parave. 'When we told Brittany she was not surprised, she knows we enjoy sex a lot.

'Rose knows about the website but we are yet to sit her down and tell her what we do.'

'I turned my life around, began bodybuilding and now I try to live pure,' adds Mr Parave. 'God has put me here to spread his word and our lifestyle community is a great place to do it.

'You can't get closer to someone than having sex with them.'
