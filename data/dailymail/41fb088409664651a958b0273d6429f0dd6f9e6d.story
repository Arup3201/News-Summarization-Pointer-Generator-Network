Roma owner James Pallotta has warned Manchester United not to waste their time on a bid for midfielder Kevin Strootman.

The Holland international is admired by Louis van Gaal and was key to his national team selections up until a cruciate ligament injury.

United are keen on the 24-year-old who is poised to make his playing comeback soon after returning to training and doing ball work this week.

Roma have said they have no plans to sell Manchester United target Kevin Strootman in January 

Rudi Garcia said he hoped to have the Dutchman back when they face Manchester City in December

'It is just not happening,' said Pallotta, who was talking at London's Leaders in Sport conference.

'I have told the papers they should stop wasting paper. We don't have any interest in selling Kevin.

'As businesspeople, when people call and say ''we want your player'', you are going to listen them. You have to do that.

'That doesn't mean you are going to make a decision that, £75million, bang, you hit the bid. That is not the way it is going to work with us.

'For others maybe. Our view is we want to put a great team out there; our goal is stability.'

Meanwhile, Barcelona have invited United target and 15-year-old Norway international Martin Odegaard to train with the club.

Strootman tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a loss at Napoli  but is expected to return  next month
