A woman was locked inside a petrol station because the RBS and Natwest computer crash meant she was unable to pay for her fuel.

Laura Grogan's RBS debit card failed when she tried to pay for her fuel, and she claims that although she tried to explain staff refused to let her leave while they waited for a device to empty the fuel out of her car.

She had tried to persuade staff that she would return with money if they let her leave, but to no avail.

Trapped: Laura Grogan says she was locked inside the Firwood Service Station in Bolton when her RBS debit card failed as she tried to pay for fuel

Ms Grogan even called police to the Firwood Service Station in Bolton, Greater Manchester, She had reported that she was being shouted at and a staff member was refusing to let her leave.

When officers arrived they told the cashier that the dispute was a civil matter, and 29-year-old Ms Grogan should be allowed to leave.

Choice: The owner of the petrol station said Ms Grogan could have arranged for someone else to pay for her fuel over the phone, or leave her details - but had refused to do either

Her partner Gordon Thomas, 28, said staff used abusive 
language towards the mother of two and threatened her, and that she had been badly shaken by the incident.

Mr Thomas returned to the garage later that night to pay for his partner's petrol in cash.

He said: 'It is disgraceful and totally unacceptable.

'My
partner knew money was in the account and it could have been a problem 
with his machines for all he knew when he locked her in. Why he didn't 
just take her personal details, registration plate and then let her 
leave is beyond me.'

The 
incident happened at about 8.30pm on December 2, as bank customers 
across RBS and Natwest the country were left unable to use their bank 
cards after a system crash.

Mr Thomas said staff even asked Ms Grogan to leave her new iPhone 5 with them as a deposit for the £25 of fuel.

And he claims even when staff discovered the reason the card was not working they would not back down.

Mr Thomas said: 'She came home in tears as she understandably felt intimidated at being locked in somewhere by a bunch of men.'

'At the end of the day, she was on her own and we have two kids, who could well have been in the car with her.'

Reez Patel, the owner of the petrol 
station, said that Ms Grogan had been offered the choice of arranging 
for someone else to pay for her fuel over the phone, or leave her 
details so a future payment could be arranged - but she had refused to 
do either.

Abusive: Ms Grogran's partner Gordon Thomas said she left badly shaken after staff threatened her and used abusive language

Last Monday, supermarket trolleys full of food were abandoned, mothers were unable to buy milk for babies and motorists could not purchase fuel as RBS's payment systems crashed completely.

Millions of customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards, with some told they had gone into overdraft because payments could not be processed.

The computer glitch lasted for around three hours, and affected cash machines, smartphone apps and websites belonging to RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank.

RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised for the technical problems which plagued 'Cyber Monday', said to be the biggest online shopping day of the year.

He blamed it on years of underinvestment into the bank's computer systems, and vowed to 'do better' in the future.

The British Government owns 81 per cent of RBS Group, and the IT troubles could harm its attempts to reduce its stake and return the bank to the private sector.

Mr Patel 
added that staff had been wary to let Ms Grogan leave because the garage
had lost £8,000 through non-payment in the last year, but denied that 
she had been locked in.

He said that the cashier had not told Ms Grogan the fuel would be removed from her car.

He said that when Ms Grogan's bank card had not worked, neither she nor the cashiers had known about the problems with RBS.

'She came into the shop and her card did not work,' the 31-year-old said.

'We give customers options, they can call someone to make an over the phone payment, or fill in a no means of payment form.

'She refused to do that.'

He
added: 'Sometimes people do not come back, and the police say it is 
just a civil matter so we lose out. Last year we lost £8,000 through no 
means of payment.

'We have had to be strict.'

Mr Patel said that Ms Grogan had been unable to leave the store because the door lock mechanism, controlled from the cash desk, had caught as it was not closed properly.

'We lock the doors from inside for safety because of the risk of armed robbers,' he said.

He said that Ms Grogan had called police after the cashier told her she would have to fill in a form, or arrange for a payment to be taken.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed that officers were called out to the garage at around 8.55pm, after a call from Ms Grogan - who said she was unable to arrange for a payment as she was on another person's phone.

The spokesman said that officers had reported that a cashier was being aggressive.

'It is a civil dispute, we were going to address the behaviour of the cashier however,' he said.
