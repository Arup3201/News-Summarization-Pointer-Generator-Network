Texas police are trying to determine the series of events leading up to a 50-year-old running into a gas station Friday morning with a gunshot wound to the face.

The incident occurred at a Chevron in Fort Worth about 5.30am.

CCTV shows a red Toyota quickly pulling up outside the station, with a man jumping out of the car and bolting inside.

Covered in blood and pleading for help, the victim told the gas station clerk to call 911.

'Help': The man comes running into the gas station, covered in blood, pleading for assistance

Badly injured: The footage shows the man, with an obvious injury around his mouth

911: The victim asked the gas station clerk to call for help, and he then went back outside

The man had been shot in the face.

Judging by the footage, the bullet hit him around the mouth area.

However, according to NBC DFW, rather than attend to the wound, he waited outside for the police and ambulance to arrive.

Then, once help arrived, the victim refused to cooperate.

He would not tell police who shot him or where.

It also remains unclear why he chose to drive to the gas station for assistance. 

Sgt. Steve Enright told WFAA that the man got into a physical altercation at a nearby apartment complex, but was then shot at another location.

The victim has not yet been identified.

He was rushed to John Peter Smith hospital in Fort Worth.

Officials say his injuries are not life-threatening.
