Speeding: Samuel Goody admitted arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice

An enraged driver reversed up to a speed camera, poured petrol over it and set it on fire after it flashed his Land Rover.

Council worker Samuel Goody told police that someone else had stolen the car when he was arrested on suspicion of the arson attack, a court heard.

The 25-year-old avoided being sent to prison after a judge was told he was a hard worker, and instead was given a deferred sentence pending 200 hours of unpaid work - and was driven away from court in the same Land Rover involved in the case.

Investigators traced him Goody identifying the last vehicle flashed by the device.

Goody, who has some learning difficulties and  was described by his defence lawyer Leon Kazakos as a highly-motivated and talented young man but 'not without his difficulties', was driving down Epsom Road in Merrow, Surrey, at around 2am on December 1 last year.

Witnesses who were woken by 'a disturbance' said they saw a man in a Land Rover driving back to the traffic island the speed camera was on, the judge heard.

Prosecutor Rhiannon Sadler said one resident 'could see a male moving around in the vehicle.

'He moved to the camera and poured something over it,' she said.

The witness described seeing the man driving off a short distance before returning on foot and setting fire to the camera.

When emergency services arrived in response to the call made by the woman and her husband, the camera was flat on the ground and damaged beyond repair by the fire, at a cost of more than £8,300 pounds.

Officers investigating the attack, in Epsom Road, Merrow, Surrey, confirmed a Land Rover, listed as belonging to Goody, had been caught on that camera at the time of attack.

On the road: Goody left court in the same Land Rover he was caught speeding in - and which he claimed had been stolen when the offence occurred

The following day Mr Goody reported his vehicle stolen, saying he had left it in a yard in Cobham and returned the following morning to find it missing.

The black, short wheelbase Defender model was discovered in Shere a couple of days later, allegedly as a result of a call from the defendant. There was no damage to the exterior of the car, nor to the ignition.

Goody then became evasive and officers, suspicious of him, carried out cell site analysis on his mobile phone which revealed he had been in the area of the fire at the time.

Smashed: Police put out a plea for information after residents saw a man reverse up to the camera, pour petrol over it and set it on fire

He was arrested on January 29 by a traffic patrol and in interview he maintained his false account and was very defensive, officers said.

Police charged him with arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice, which he later admitted.

Miss
Sadler said the 25-year-old had convictions for affray, battery and 
resisting arrest, and the probation service confirmed in March this year
he was convicted at Basildon, in Essex, of an assault.

Stupid decision: Goody hugs friends and relatives outside the court on learning that he will do 200 hours unpaid work rather than being sent straight to prison

The defendant works for the county council and is also self-employed, carrying out tree surgery work and other garden and landscaping-related activities.

The probation officer told the judge the defendant’s learning difficulties made him susceptible but that 'when he keeps busy it’s not a problem'.

Mr Kazakos admitted his client's case was unusual, saying: 'Rather than seek the assistance of others as he ought to, he battles on alone, making things worse for himself.

'That night, in speeding past the camera, he would have attracted points and no more. What followed was a stupid decision which he will regret for the rest of his life.'

Judge Christopher Critchlow, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, told Goody that the offences together may merit a jail sentence.

He told him to do all or most of the 200 hours and to also continue to put money aside to put towards the bill for the damaged camera and/or the prosecution’s costs.

Goody, of Hersham, Surrey, was ordered to return to court on March 14 next year.
