It really has turned into the dream month for Andre Schurrle.

After lifting the World Cup with Germany in Brazil last Sunday, the Chelsea forward has now learned how to walk on water - or at least appear to.

The 23-year-old posted a video on his Instagram account showing him controls a water jet-pack in the sea while on holiday.

The jet-pack sucks up water and pushes it down into the sea, forcing Schurrle up into the air and making it seem like he is levitating across the surface of the ocean.

Schurrle scored three goals during the World Cup, including two in the 7-1 semi-final rout of Brazil, as Germany secured their fourth triumph at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janiero last weekend.

Germany beat Argentina 1-0 after extra-time in the final thanks to substitute Mario Gotze's wonderful control and volley.

Schurrle will enjoy a break before returning for pre-season training with Chelsea.
