With the death of his six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, Eric Meyer had suffered a year of heartache and loss, one that will take him many more to get over.

So the web designer from Cleveland, Ohio, was ill-prepared to have that grief dragged up again when he logged on to Facebook to discover a picture of her, with the cheery message: 'Eric, here's what your year looked like.'

Mr Meyer was just one of a number of the social network's users stunned as a new feature brought them face-to-face with dead loved ones by offering them a selection of their highlights of the year .

Insensitive: Facebook's Year In Review feature brought some users face-to-face with bad memories of 2014

Unleashed just before Christmas, Facebook's Year In Review feature sorts photos automatically from users' profiles, selecting those which had provoked the most responses as 'highlights'.

For a number of users, the choices brought back unpleasant memories.

Mr Meyer wrote on his blog, meyerweb.com, how, following his daughter Rebecca's death, he had not felt inclined to see his Facebook 'Year In Review', despite seeing his friends' slideshows popping up in his news feed.

Then he logged in to the social network shortly before Christmas to find it exhorting him directly to make one of his own.

It was decorated with a picture of his late daughter, staring straight at him from the screen.

'Yes, my year looked like that. True enough. My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl. It was still unkind to remind me so forcefully,' he wrote.

When a pet dies, or a Facebook user posts about bad news, clicking the Like button to express sympathy doesn’t feel quite right.

So, with this in mind, the social network is said to be thinking of alternative ways for its members to show they care, without appearing tactless or insensitive.

It could help to avoid future gaffes like those bumbled into by Facebook's Year In Review, by giving algorithms a more nuanced understanding of why users have interacted with a post.

Facebook tycoon Mark Zuckerberg, pictured top right, admitted he is working on a dislike button - but it is unlikely to be called dislike.

Speaking at the firm’s offices in California, Mr Zuckerberg said: ‘We need to figure out the right way to do it so [the button] ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad.’

He continued that people could use a button designed to express negative sentiment in the ‘wrong way’, that could be deemed cruel or mean.

However, when such a button will be introduced is not known, and the site has been talking about the feature since 2010. 

Conceding it was not a 'deliberate assault', but a perverse outcome of Facebook's automation, Mr Meyer nevertheless called the incident 'jarring'.

'This inadvertent algorithmic cruelty is the result of code that works in the overwhelming majority of cases, reminding people of the awesomeness of their years, showing them selfies at a party or whale spouts from sailing boats or the marina outside their vacation house,' he wrote.

'But for those of us who lived through the death of loved ones, or spent extended time in the hospital, or were hit by divorce or losing a job or any one of a hundred crises, we might not want another look at this past year.'

After Mr Meyer's blog post went viral, Jonathan Gheller, product manager for Facebook, emailed him to apologise.

Mr Gheller told The Washington Post: '[The app] was awesome for a lot of people, but clearly in this [Mr Meyer's] case we brought him grief rather than joy.'

Mr Meyer was not the only Facebook user to face grief rather than joy in the social network's offer of a Year In Review.

New York City-based advertising copywriter Mark Duffy revealed on Twitter how Facebook had automatically selected a picture of his dead father's ashes to entice him to see his Year In Review.

It was tastefully framed by a picture of a group of stick men who appeared to be dancing.

Sarah-Jane, a Twitter user from Australia, wrote: 'I'm so glad that Facebook made my 'Year in Review' image a picture of my now dead dog. I totally wanted to sob uncontrollably this Xmas Eve.'

And Rosie from Haywards Heath wrote on Twitter how she had been confronted with her dead grandparents.

The 31-year-old, who would only give her first name, told The Independent: 'My Year In Review came up with a photo I'd posted following my Nonna's unexpected passing recently.

'It struck me as ill-considered, because their algorithm clearly can't distinguish why an image has been used - deceased relative, missing child, images taken following accidents or assaults - all things I've seen posted on Facebook this year which are hardly things you want to remember.'

Mr Meyer, a web designer, also had a nuanced critique of the potential pitfalls posed by Facebook's Year In Review, blaming it on the fact that 'algorithms are essentially thoughtless'.

He added: 'Where the human aspect fell short, at least with Facebook, was in not providing a way to opt out. The Year in Review ad keeps coming up in my feed, rotating through different fun-and-fabulous backgrounds, as if celebrating a death, and there is no obvious way to stop it.'

In a subsequent blog post however, Mr Meyer issued his own apology to Facebook and Mr Gheller, Year In Review's product manager, for singling them out for a problem which affects many other online services.

'I am very sorry that I dropped the Internet on [Mr Gheller's] head for Christmas. He and his team didn’t deserve it,' Mr Meyer wrote.
