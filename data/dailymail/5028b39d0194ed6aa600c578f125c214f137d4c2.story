A woman claiming to be a Romany princess tormented her gay neighbour by calling her a 'pervert lesbian' as part of a homophobic campaign.

Jayne Collins repeatedly swore at her neighbour, threatened to smash a bottle in her face and made her life hell during months of anti-gay abuse.

Collins is now facing jail after a court found her guilty of harassing Helen Leach.

Homophobic abuse: Jayne Collins is facing jail after making her gay neighbour's life hell

Miss Leach reported 48-year-old Collins to police after a catalogue of homophobic incidents, Cardiff Magistrates' Court was told.

She told the court: 'I was extremely upset - I’ve always tried to keep my home life private.

'She would say: “You should go back where you came from,” and she told me: “ Why don’t you come down here for a talk and I’ll smash a bottle in your face”.'

Miss Leach started suffering anxiety and panic attacks and was even forced to move out of her home, the court was told.

Traditional Romany gypsies. Collins claimed to be the widow of a Romany prince

Collins - who claims to be the widow of a Romany prince - told the court she was a qualified clairvoyant and dealt tarot cards during the proceedings.

'I didn't want to see two women necking in my face... it's against God's law'

Collins told magistrates: 'My neighbour has been tutored by a black witch.

'I didn’t want to see two women necking in my face, I didn’t want to see it.

'It’s against God’s law, that’s not how I feel, that’s just the way it is. Who am I to question God’s law.'

Collins, of Llanishen, Cardiff, was found guilty of harassment and threatening behaviour.

She was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing later this month.
