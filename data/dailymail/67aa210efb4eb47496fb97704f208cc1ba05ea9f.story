Four prison officers have been badly injured after being slashed and stabbed with broken glass by a crazed inmate.

The wardens were set upon by the prisoner who is said to have 'flipped' as he was being taken out of his cell for lunch at Birmingham's Winson Green Prison on Wednesday afternoon.

One officer was stabbed five times by the prisoner on the jail's health care unit - while another man was slashed on his arm.

'Crazed': Winson Green prison in Birmingham where four prison officers have been badly injured after being slashed and stabbed with broken glass by an inmate

A third male suffered leg wounds and a fourth sustained an injury to their hand after being attacked with the 'improvised weapon', police said.

Two of the prison officers yesterday remained in a stable condition in hospital while the other pair were released following treatment.

The prisoner has now been transferred to a mental health facility while investigations are carried out

Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Police were called by the ambulance service at 12.48pm on Wednesday to a report of four prison officers being assaulted at HMP Birmingham.

'Initial inquiries suggest that the four were injured by an improvised weapon.

The four men were taken to hospital. Two remain in hospital in a stable condition.

'Detectives have launched an investigation into the assault and we are working closely with the prison.

'A prisoner has been transferred to a mental health facility while inquiries continue.'

Glyn Travis, assistant secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said: 'We understand four officers have been attacked - one very seriously.

'The prison officer most badly injured suffered nasty stab and slash wounds but is in a stable condition in hospital. He is currently awaiting further surgery to his arm.

'The others I believe have since been released from hospital after suffering cuts and lacerations to various parts of their body.

'For whatever reason this prisoner has become upset about something, it can be we entirely unprovoked and just serves as a reminder of how dangerous our job can be.

'The staff at Birmingham prison do an exceptional and professional job. We are not there to be punch bags - we are there to rehabilitate and care for prisoners.

'We offer the officer's family our support and wish him a full and speedy recovery.'

One officer was stabbed five times during the attack on the prison's health care unit, while another was slashed on his arm. It is believed the prisoner has been transferred to a mental health unit

In a statement, G4S, who took over running of the prison last October, said: 'Four members of staff were injured during an incident at the prison on Wednesday.

'The staff, all members of the prison's healthcare unit, were wounded in an altercation with a prisoner on remand, with two staff receiving serious lacerations.

'All staff were transferred to local hospitals for treatment. The prisoner has been contained.

'The safety and welfare of our staff and those in our care is our utmost priority, and we have launched an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding this attack.

'Our thoughts are with our staff at this time.'

In June, a report by the chief inspector of prisons found the privatised jail faced 'significant strategic challenges'.
