Most people keep their money under the floorboards, but one savvy shopper managed to save more than $4200 by buying them.

Sheila Laird couldn't believe her luck when  Oak flooring, normally retailing at $65 per case, was reduced to an incredible $2.97 per box on Home Depot's website.

Fearing she would miss out on the deal, Laird printed the ad and took it to a nearby outlet where she bought 22 boxes.

Opportunist: Sheila Laird took advantage of a pricing error on the Home Depot website to buy floorboards for her home at just $3 a square foot

Error: Sheila Laird ordered 72 boxes of hardwood from Home Depot which was incorrectly advertised for $2.97 per box instead of square foot

She also paid for another 
50 boxes at a different location to floor her 1500 square foot condo in Calgary, Canada.

The proposal specialist paid just $213.84 for 72 boxes of hardwood.

But Global News reported that when she went to pick up the flooring, Home Depot cancelled the order. 

The low, listed price was a mistake that should have read $2.97 per square foot - not box - which would have cost $4455.

'They
said, ‘no sorry, it was an associate error, we can’t let you have it, 
we’ll give you a free case if you buy the other 52 cases at 65 dollars a
case',' Laird said.

'I'm like, ‘yeah, but I have a receipt. You 
guys actually put it through the system'.'

Prepared: Stunned at the cheap price, Sheila Laird printed a copy of the offer from the Home Depot website

Good customer service: Home Depot agreed to honor the discount rate, acknowledging it had made an online error

Laird believes the store shouldn’t be allowed to renege on the deal.

'My
motto is it never hurts to ask, so I asked, I went in and I received it
and I paid for it. So I haven’t done anything wrong as far as I’m 
concerned,' she said. 

Home Depot agreed to honor the sale after being contacted by Global News.

'We understand there was an error made at one of our stores. Our customer service team has contacted Mrs Laird and apologized for the misunderstanding. She will receive her flooring and it should be delivered to her home over the next few days,' the company said in a statement to the media outlet.

Consumer experts say there is no law in Canada requiring that Home Depot honor the ad, as stores have a right to refuse a sale if there's been a mistake.
