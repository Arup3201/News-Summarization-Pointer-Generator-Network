A  63-stone teenage girl had to be rescued from her own home after calling out to her mother from her bedroom that she could not stand up, it emerged today.

Her stepfather Arthur Treloar revealed how 19-year-old Georgia Davis's desperate plea for help sparked the dramatic operation to smash into her house to get her to hospital.

She needed urgent care last week but had to wait eight hours as walls were knocked down before she could be carried from her home into an ambulance.

Mr Treloar blames himself for his stepdaughter's condition because she quit a fat camp in America and piled on the pounds after he was diagnosed with lung cancer.

Heartache: 63 stone Georgia Davis, 19, from Aberdare, South Wales, was struggling with the guilt of dumping a mystery boyfriend

He said: 'It breaks my heart to think of what poor Georgia has been through. It's all my fault.

'She had watched her own dad die of a heart attack when she was a toddler. One day she turned to me and said: 'I've lost one dad - I can't lose another.'

It cost an estimated £100,000 as emergency workers spent eight hours cutting her free as two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, were demolished to remove her from her first-floor bedroom.

She remained at the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil over the weekend while doctors continued to test for medical complaints including diabetes, kidney disease, spinal problems and respiratory failure.

Her heart rate and blood pressure are being constantly monitored.

Britain's fattest teenager had told friends on Facebook of her fears for her life because of her diet of junk food, chocolate and fizzy drinks.

She said: 'We all die in the end...but food will inevitably kill me. I can't handle losing weight, my stepdad's lung cancer, mum's sickness and my depression all at once.'

A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of the house in Aberdare, South Wales, so that the emergency services could remove the teenager

Mr Treloar, 73, told the Sun on Sunday how his step-daughter had been gaining weight since her return from fat camp - staying in her bedroom watching television or messaging her friends.

He said she managed to come downstairs to eat or talk to her family by sliding down on her bottom, but last Monday she confessed she could no longer stand up.

'Georgia had been in terrible pain for a long time from sores and swelling in her feet, but as usual she was trying to protect me and her mum so she kept if from us, ' added Mr Treloar.

Over 40 firemen, medics and engineers took part in the operation last Thursday to rescue Georgia and take her to hospital in a reinforced ambulance after her mother Lesley called a doctor. It was the first time she had been out of the house in six months.

Ambulance men, paramedics, contractors from RCT homes, police, firemen, social workers all helped in the operation

A bridge was also built from the roadside to the top floor with between 30 to 40 people involved in the operation

Friends and neighbours claim Mrs Davis, 57, bought all her daughter's food which included processed ready-meals, sandwiches and packs of peanuts and crisps. She is also partial to sausages, pasties, chips, chocolate and chunks of cheese with bottles of coke or pints of milk.’ 

She has previously spoken of her guilt over the teenager’s obesity. She has said of Georgia’s weight: ‘I feel guilty, of course I do.’

In an interview, she said she and her daughter had started comfort eating after her husband Geoff died when Georgia was five.

But she said she had later made a determined effort to change their diets – such as making her own chips instead of buying them from the takeaway.

She said in the interview: ‘I wish I could turn back the clock. But if you’ve never had food addiction, you can’t understand. You try to fight it but it’s like a drug.’

The cost of removing Miss Davis is estimated to cost £100,000 to cover manpower, plus the emergency call-out and the reconstruction of the demolished walls

The operation began just after 9am, and she was seen leaving the scene in an ambulance just after 5pm

In 2008, Georgia told reporters: ‘Some people choose heroin but I’ve chosen food and it’s killing me.’

In the past, she has spoken of eating ‘a couple of loaves-worth of sandwiches filled with jam or cheese or meat’ every day.

This was in addition to five bags of cheese and onion crisps, two packets of chocolate bourbons, sponge cake, trifle chocolate cake, and four sausages with mashed potato and baked beans for dinner, as well as fizzy drinks. She consumed as much as 13,000 calories a day.

Georgia returned from the Wellspring Academy in North Carolina, in June 2009, weighing around 19st after losing 14st 6lbs by ditching her diet of cheese, biscuits and chocolate for regular exercise salads and lean meat.

But when she learned of her stepfather's cancer, she would not go back to the fat camp.

Mr Treloar told the Sun: 'It was the beginning of the end because she refused to return to America and for that I blame myself. It was difficult for Georgia to maintain her weight loss because she couldn't find the right foods in the supermarket in Aberdare.'

Mr Treloar revealed that Georgia had been forced to wear a bed sheet because clothes no longer fitted her. Now doctors have told her she can only have 2,000 calories a day to ensure she loses weight.

He said: 'She is feeling depressed but we're doing our best to keep her spirits up. She's sick and we're worried sick.'

On Facebook, Georgia told friends she was not coping with her family's health.  She said: 'I have my issues. At the moment dealing with everything is too much.

'I need to take it one step at a time, but I will fix all this.' She confessed that she was smoking heavily to avoid comfort eating and had contracted an infection.

'My life cannot get possibly worse,' she said. 'I have needs sorting out because it's added loads more weight on to me. It's unbearable now.'

Her mother says Georgia was always a large child, pictured here eating a lolly as a toddler

Early signs: Miss Davis was an overweight toddler, and the rapid growth has continued to this day

A hospital spokesman said: ‘This young lady has had a settled night and has been seen this morning by the consultant in charge of her care.

‘Initial assessments have been undertaken and she will be undergoing further assessment during the day to assist in her plan of care.’
