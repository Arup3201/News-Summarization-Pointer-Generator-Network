The first police officers to arrive on the scene of the Newtown school massacre have spoken of the unimaginable horror that greeted them, with one describing how he cradled a dying girl in his arms and told her 'You're safe now, your parents love you.'

Another brave policeman said he found a little girl standing in shock and covered in blood in the middle of her classroom with the dead bodies of her school friends scattered around her.

Speaking for the first time about the shooting, the officers said they could hear gunshots still ringing out as they entered the Sandy Hook Elementary school, where a gunman killed 20 children and six teachers a week before Christmas in one of the worst school shootings in US history.

Brave: (L-R) Lt. Chris Vanghele, school resource officer Jason Flynn, school resource officer Leonard Penna, detective Jason Frank and officer William Chapman of the Newtown Police Department have spoken out about the horror they witnessed as first responders to the Sandy Hook shooting

'One look, and your life was absolutely changed,' Michael McGowan, one seven Newtown officers to share their stories, told The New York Times of the grisly scene inside the school.

Officers who had raced from the Newtown Police station first saw the lifeless bodies of the school's head teacher Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, the school psychologist, slumped on the floor in the lobby.

Officer Leonard Penna, who entered the building with two other officers through a side door that takes you to the boiler room, said: 'You saw them lifeless, laying down.'

'For a split second, your mind says 
could this be a mock crime scene, could this be fake, but in the next 
split second, you're saying, there is no way. This is real.'

Officer William Chapman said he and 
McGowan traveled the two miles from the station to the school at 
break-neck speed after the first reports of gunshots and breaking glass 
came in.

'We drove as fast as we've ever 
driven,' McGowan told The Times.They got there in under three minutes 
as shots were still being fired.

Gunman: Adam Lanza, pictured, killed 20 children and six teachers a week before Christmas in one of the worst school shootings in US history

Chapman said the gunfire stopped for a short time.

'But then we heard 
more popping,' he said, adding that the officers could tell the gunman was using a rifle. 'It was up so close, 
it sounded like it was coming from outside. So we were all looking 
around for someone to shoot back at.'

After following the sound inside the 
school, Chapman walked into a classroom where he saw Adam Lanza dead on 
the floor. The officers didn't describe the state of the 20-year-old's 
body or how they felt when they first saw him slumped in the room.

With another officer, Chapman searched for signs of life among the children and found a girl with a faint pulse.

He said he cradled her in his arms and carried her outside to an ambulance telling her 'You're safe now, your parents love you.' Chapman said he later heard the girl had died.

Penna was the first to enter another 
classroom where Lanza had shot dead most of the victims with a .223 
Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle.

Amid the carnage, he said he found a girl standing alone surrounded by dead bodies. She was covered in blood and in shock but otherwise unharmed.

Not aware the gunman had been found he told her to stay where she was, 
but after seeing Lanza dead he ran back and grabbed the girl to take her 
out of the scene of horror.

Detective
 Jason Frank told The Times the teacher had her young students 'huddled up
 like a mother hen' in a corner.

McGowan said the frightened staff 
refused to open the doors to police at first, seeking to protect the little 
ones in case there was another shooter still on the loose.

'We're
 kicking the doors, yelling "Police! Police!"' McGowan said.

He said he and his colleagues were holding their badges up to the window to try to convince the teachers that they were there to help. Detective Frank recalled how he pulled the handle off one of the doors to get to them.

As
 the children were ushered out of the building, the officers used fatherly voices to comfort them, though they were still 
concerned that Lanza had an accomplice.

'Everything is fine now,' they said and instructed the children to hold hands and close their eyes.

Safety: Officers raced from the Newtown Police station when they began getting reports of broken glass and gunfire at the school

Brave: Police patrolled the streets outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shooting on December 14 and many of them have spoken out about the horrific scene

According
 to The Times, the officers stood in front of the teachers' bodies so the children would be protected from the ghastly sight as 
they made their way out. Other officers blocked the doors 
to the two classrooms where the victims' bodies were slumped on the 
floor.

As police and state troopers flooded into the school those with young children were warned not to go into the classrooms because the sight of the massacred children was so grisly.

'Words can't describe how horrible it was,' said 27-year Newtown Police veteran Detective Joe Joudy.

Most of the officers have said they are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the tragedy and one hasn't been able to go back to work since.
