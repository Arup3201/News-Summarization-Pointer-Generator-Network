If you want to get in shape by unleashing your inner Rocky while feeling like you're in a scene from Flashdance then Piloxing is for you.

Pil-what-ing? It might sound like a vaccination programme or a take on the vintage pill box hat but Piloxing actually is the hot, new way to get fit.

The workout combines moves from Pilates and boxing so it's both fat-burning and body sculpting.

Weighted gloves are worn to work the muscles further and, like the popular Zumba class, all the moves are performed in time with a pumping music track.

Gemma Simmonds, a learning and development manager from London, attended a Piloxing class run at Push Studios in East Dulwich.

She was a Zumba devotee but was keen to try something new to keep her motivated and having full while exercising.

She said of Piloxing: 'The class sounded like the perfect way to continue to tone my troublesome areas - arms and stomach - so I signed up straight away.

'It isn't for the faint hearted, I used to come out of Zumba bright red and sweating, and this is even more intense.

'It is interval training which combines boxing, standing Pilates, even a little bit of dance, and all at 145 beats a minute, which is exhausting but gets the endorphins going. I am hooked and it now forms a key part of my fitness regime.'

Shara Tochia, 28, from Clerkenwell, London, has also tried Piloxing and has seen an increase in booking for the classes via her website Fitness-freak.com.

She said: 'Piloxing is a combination of two great fitness disciplines, boxing and pilates. An all over body workout starting at your core.

The new Zumba? Piloxing is already popular in the U.S. and is taking off in the UK

'We have seen an good uptake in bookings at Fitness-Freak.com in the past month and more fitness companies wanting to offer their classes via our website.'

As with many fitness trends, Piloxing first took the U.S. by storm and is now expected to take off over here, attracting gym goers who love classes like Zumba but are looking for a new challenge.

Celebrities including Vanessa Hudgens, Hilary Duff and Glee's Heather Morris are said to be fans of the class.

Swedish-born Viveca Jensen, a former professional dancer, came up with the idea of Piloxing as it combines her passions of dance and fitness. She's a trained Pilates instructor and started a Piloxing Academy in Toluca Lake, California, where people could learn how to teach her workout.  

Piloxing founder Jensen said: 'My mission through creating the programme was to empower women and let them know it's OK to feel strong and beautiful in their own skin'

She told She Knows Health and Wellness: 'Piloxing is a fitness program that blends the best of Pilates, boxing and dance into a high-energy interval workout that incorporates interval and barefoot training to burn maximum calories and increase stamina.

'At the core of Piloxing is the principle that women are powerful and can boost their self-esteem by taking charge of their own health.'

She added: 'There have been times in my life where I've been put in a situation which made me feel weak and let down, so my mission through creating the Piloxing program was to empower women and let them know it's OK to feel strong and beautiful in their own skin, even in times when we don't feel so strong or confident.'
