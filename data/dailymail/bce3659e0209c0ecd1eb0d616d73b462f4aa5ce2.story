This is the magical moment a newborn miniature horse explores the great outdoors for the first time - just two days after her birth.

Tiny Sorrel, who is just 50 centimetres tall, ventured out into the paddock with her five-year-old mother Bottriell Swift in Dartmoor, Devon.

Her mother gave birth unaided after a pregnancy that lasted 11 months and one week as a crowd of visitors watched at the Miniature Pony Centre.

Suzanne Dufty, the stud manager, who helped with the birth on Thursday afternoon, said: 'The birth was all very easy - and the mother gave birth herself. I helped so I was satisfied everything was fine.

'Once the waters have broken it is all over very quickly. Before that you have her walking in circles and having contractions which can take a long time.

'By the time I got there she was in the final stages and the actual birth was over in around a minute.'

Sorrel will spend the next few days 
bonding with her mother before she is introduced to the rest of the 
horses at the tourist attraction.

Tiny: At just 50cm tall Sorrel is currently one of the smallest horses in Britain. She is unlikely to grow to more than 100cm

She was Bottriel Swift's second foal after she gave birth to a horse called Beatrice a year ago.

Kevin Ginsberg, who runs the centre, added: 'Sorrel will be based at the centre. She will be bonding with her mother for a few months now.

'She is 50 centimetres tall which is pretty small but fairly average for a miniature horse at birth.'

Sorrel will stay in a stable for around a week and being let out in a field with her mother at night before she is introduced to the rest of the horses.
