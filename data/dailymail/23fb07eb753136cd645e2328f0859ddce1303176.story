The miracle dog who wagged his tail after surviving a gas chamber has found a permanent home.

Daniel, a beagle mix named by animal control workers in Alabama after the biblical figure who survived the lion's den, joined four other rescued dogs at a home 1,000 miles away in New Jersey.

He surprised workers at the animal control facility in Florence, Alabama, last month on the day he was supposed to be put down with several other animals in a stainless-steel box.

Happy: Joe Dwyer, of Nutley, New Jersey, plays with his new dog Daniel, also known as the 'Miracle Dog', on Wednesday. The beagle mix got its nickname after it survived an Alabama dog pound gas chamber

The box, roughly the size of a pickup truck bed, was filled with carbon monoxide - however Daniel emerged frightened but unscathed, still wagging his tail after the scary experience.

‘He's in extremely good shape, especially in light of what he went through,’ his new owner Joe Dwyer, 50, said Wednesday after returning from a trip to the vet’s. ‘His attitude is just incredible.’

The dog was eventually flown to New Jersey by Eleventh Hour Rescue, a non-profit organisation that saves dogs slated for euthanasia, and it received more than 100 requests to adopt him.

About half of applications from people around the country seeking to adopt Daniel said they were not interested in adopting another dog if he was not available.

'Maybe we'll get a cosmetic surgeon to make all our dogs look like Daniel,' the shelter's founder and president Linda Schiller joked last month.

Mr Dwyer said he and his family had two ‘meet-and-greets’ with Daniel before being approved for adoption, and the dog has become fast friends with the Nutley family's other four pooches.

They have two dachshunds, a beagle mix and a pit bull mix. ‘By Thursday evening they were all lying down together,’ he said. ‘It was wonderful to see.’

Only three animals have survived the gas chamber at the animal control facility in Florence in the past 12 years. 'Maybe God just had a better plan for this one,' city spokesman Phil Stevenson said.

He said that the dog may have survived because his breathing was shallow thanks to a cold. Other variables that could allow a dog to survive include the number of animals placed in the chamber.

In addition the concentration of carbon monoxide, whether the chamber is airtight or gas is leaking out and the health of the animal can also have an impact on improving their slim survival chances.

At least 15 states, including New Jersey and New York, have banned carbon monoxide for euthanising shelter animals, but it is still a method used in many parts of the country.

Mindy Gilbert, Alabama director for the Humane Society of the United States, said Daniel's story explains why the group pushed the Alabama Legislature to ban gas chambers for euthanizing dogs.

Demonstrators were rallying in Pennsylvania on Saturday for a bill named after Daniel to ban gas chambers in the state, reported the Newark Star-Ledger.
