Boardroom executives at FTSE100 companies pocketed huge bonuses, according to a survey published today by pay research group Incomes Data Services (IDS).

These helped push their average total earnings to £2.4million – 21 per cent higher than last year. The staggering sum is almost 100 times higher than the national average wage of £26,500 per annum.

FTSE100 chief executives now earn 120 times more than their full-time staff, the report said. Critics said the findings showed a ‘huge gap’ in pay levels between boardrooms and ordinary workers.

Most British staff have seen their pay lag behind inflation since the financial crash. Wages are expected to rise in real terms this year as the economy picks up – but the increase comes after years of stagnant pay.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show there has been no real terms pay increase in the UK for ten years.

The basic salary for most FTSE 100 directors rose last year by 2.5 per cent – just below the 2.8 per cent level of inflation at the time, the IDS report said.

But they benefited from a ‘significant boost’ in bonuses and other rewards. Most executives receive shares in their company – on top of a cash bonus – when hitting performance targets.

Last year the number of such long-term share schemes paying out rose by 44 per cent.

Top directors also enjoyed a 12 per cent rise in bonuses. The findings cover chief executives, finance directors and any executive chairman sitting on FTSE100 company boards.

Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS report, said: ‘FTSE100 directors have seen their total earnings jump sharply in the last year, fuelled by a rise in the value of share-based awards. Bonus payments have also recovered strongly following a downturn last year.’

He added that long-term share schemes also ‘give a significant boost to directors’ earnings’.

FTSE100 chief executives – who are generally the highest paid in any organisation – receive an average basic salary of £832,000 and an average bonus of £1million. They also benefit from share payouts of around £2million.

Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, has faced outrage from investors after his total pay package soared from £17.5million to £30million last year

Since 2000, the average pay for chief executives has increased almost four-fold, the report says, while average wages have risen by just 48 per cent.

Sir Martin Sorrell, the head of advertising giant WPP, has faced outrage from investors after his total pay package soared from £17.5million to £30million last year, bolstered by lucrative share schemes. One third of the company’s shareholders refused to back the rewards, which were criticised as ‘lavish’.

The taxman has ramped up prosecutions against individuals suspected of tax dodging – but is still accused of letting corporate giants off the hook.

The number of court cases HMRC brought for illegal tax evasion rose last year by almost a third – from 612 to 795 – data from Thomson Reuters shows today.

The figure is a significant jump from the 302 cases it won in 2011/12. Each case can, however, take months to process, so it is not known how many of the recent cases were successful.

HMRC will be granted highly controversial powers that will allow it to raid bank accounts directly in an effort to close Britain’s £35billion annual tax gap. But a history of mistakes and blunders have led to fears that the new powers could lead to innocent people having their savings taken. In the same year that prosecutions soared, 5.5million people were sent the wrong tax bill because of an HMRC mishap.

Thousands more were sent incorrect information a second time despite the revenue trying to amend the mistake, it emerged this month.

But critics say it has done too little to rein in dodging by big corporations. It is claimed the taxman has done deals with Google that allow the internet giant to avoid paying millions in the UK. The company funnels its revenues through Ireland, paying a fraction in Britain of what tax experts say it truly owes. Other large companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, use similar tactics that have been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs.

Critics said there was a ‘gulf’ opening up between boardrooms and office floors.

Deborah Hargreaves from the High Pay Centre think-tank said: ‘There’s a huge gap opening up. We’ve seen workforce wages stagnating across the board, while chief executives’ remuneration continues to go up.

‘This is not healthy for our economy, our country or our society.

‘They are getting all the benefits from a company’s success, while everybody at the company should be rewarded.’

Earlier this month the International Monetary Fund called for a radical shake-up of bankers’ pay.

The global finance body demanded a ‘better mix of incentives’ for top executives.
