It really was the stuff of fairytales when Rory Donald asked his girlfriend to marry him, after the romantic illustrator chose to print his proposal in the pages of a childrens' story-book.

Mr Donald, 38, popped the question to girlfriend of four years Cheryl Lucas at the front of children's book Pigs Might Surf, which features his drawings.

When the book's authors asked him if wanted to include anything on the dedication page, Mr Donald chose the simple message: 'To Cheryl, will you marry me? Rory x'.

Picture perfect proposal: Romantic Rory Donald proposed to his girlfriend Cheryl Lucas on the dedication page of a children's book he created illustrations for

Mr Donald said it seemed the perfect way to propose to his sweetheart, but admitted it was 'nerve-racking' printing the question for the world to see.

'I was just coming up to doing the drawings for the last pages of
 the book when Olly called to see if I’d like to put anything on the 
dedication page,' said the illustrator, from Tintagel in North Cornwall.

'That’s when the penny dropped - I 
had been thinking about popping the question for about a year but I 
wanted a really unique way of doing it - this seemed perfect.

'It was very nerve-racking though as it was very public.

'If she'd have said no, I'd had to have bought every copy of the book myself to ensure no-one saw the proposal page,' said Mr Donald.

But delighted Cheryl, 34, immediately accepted after the illustrator got down on one knee clutching a copy of Pigs Might Surf at their local pub The Millhouse Inn in Trebarwith, Cornwall.

The happy couple married in the same pub on Saturday.

The groom even chose a wedding outfit inspired by his favourite children's book character for the ceremony - Willy Wonka.

Cheryl chose a more traditional white
 dress for their big day, but added her own unique twist by teaming it 
with purple trainers.

The book, penned by husband and wife team Olly Miles and Anna Louise, is about a pig named Bailie who fulfils his dream to be the first pig on a surf board, and is set in Cornwall.
