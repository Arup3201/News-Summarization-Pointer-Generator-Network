Felipe Massa and Sergio Perez were admitted to hospital following a horror last-lap collision in Sunday's incident-hit Canadian Grand Prix.

Dicing for fourth place, Massa smashed into the back of Perez on the run down to Turn 1 which saw both drivers crashing into the tyre barriers.

Massa and Perez miraculously both appeared unscathed from the incident, despite the severity of the crash, but they were immediately taken to the on-track medical centre.

They were then referred to hospital in downtown Montreal where Massa posted a picture giving the 'thumbs up'.Â 

The G forces sustained in the crash triggered a safety alarm inside the cockpits of both cars.

A
 statement from Williams read: 'Felipe OK but after checks at the 
medical centre he has been taken to hospital for further precautionary 
checks due to the heavy impact.'

Sebastian Vettel, who had just overtaken Perez to claim the final podium spot in a stunning race won by his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, was almost taken out by Massa as the Brazilian lost control of his Williams.

Otmar Szafnauer, Force India's Chief Operating Officer, appeared to lay the blame of the incident at Massa's door.

He said: 'I don't know what Felipe was thinking. You try that sort of ambitious move and that is the end result. 'We see the stewards and they will review the data and video.'

But the race stewards deemed Perez to be at fault for the crash after he 'changed his racing line' and the Mexican will now serve a five-place grid penalty at the Austrian Grand Prix in a fortnight's time.

The FIA later confirmed that both drivers had been discharged from hospital following the precautionary checks.

A statement from world governing body read: 'Following the accident between Sergio Perez and Felipe Massa on the final lap of the Canadian Grand Prix, it has been confirmed both drivers extricated themselves from their cars and were immediately transferred to the medical centre for preliminary checks.

'The results of these checks were entirely positive. However, as a precautionary measure they were both transferred to Sacre Coeur hospital for further examination. Both of them have been discharged.'
