MPs have been banned from bringing in a cat to catch mice in Parliament because they cannot be trusted not to feed it scraps.

Commons Speaker John Bercow warned ‘well-meaning’ politicians would give the cat treats, leaving it too fat to bother chasing rodents.

He also ruled that some people in Parliament might be allergic to a cat, which would also be at risk of being run over on Whitehall’s busy roads.

There are more than 200 official sightings of mice every year in Parliament, in the bars and restaurants

The Houses of Parliament are plagued 
with mice, with staff often seeing them running across desks or 
scurrying along the corridors of power.

Every
 year more than 200 sightings are reported to the authorities, although 
the true figure is likely to be much higher because many people have 
given up complaining.

There have been growing calls for a resident cat to be brought in to help deal with the problem.

But
 the idea has been rejected by officials on health and safety grounds. 
Mr Bercow has written to MPs warning of the practical problems.

Lib
 Dem MP John Thurso, a spokesman for the Commons Commission, said one of
 the obsctales was ‘the likelihood that well-meaning colleagues would 
feed a cat, making it unlikely that it would catch mice’.

He added: ‘A cat would be at risk from the 1,748 poisonous bait stations used across the estate to control pest populations.’

MPs have been rebuffed in their call for a cat to prowl Parliament to deal with a mouse problem

Officials were also concerned about the ‘effect on people who are allergic to cats’.

‘There would be no reliable way to stop the cat getting on to the busy roads which surround us, nor of looking after the cat responsibly,’ he added.

Battersea Dogs and Cats Home had offered rescue cat to prowl the parliamentary estate, but this has been declined.

Mr Thurso added: ‘The size, age and location of the Parliamentary Estate make controlling mice and pests a major undertaking.’

Last year there were 221 mouse sighting reported in Parliament, down from 254 in 2012 but up on 195 in 2011.

Larry the Downing Street cat was brought in to deal with vermin, but was accused of lacking killer instinct

It included three sightings in the Members’ Tea Room last year and another nine in the Terrace Cafeteria.

The cost of pest control including mice in 2012-13 was £73,522.12.

In early 2011 David Cameron rejected calls for a cat to be brought in to deal with a rat infestation in Downing Street.

But weeks later he agreed to home Larry, a four-year-old tabby. After winning over staff in Number 10, he soon fell victim to a briefing operation against him for failing to catch any mice. ‘There is a distinct lack of killer instinct,’ a source said.

The fur flew when George Osborne then brought in his own cat, Freya, who regularly gets into fights with Larry.
