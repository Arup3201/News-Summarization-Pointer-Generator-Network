Serena Williams has shown that she is well and truly over her Wimbledon illness problems by proving the power she possesses.

The US tennis superstar took to Instagram to capture a video of herself doing an impressive-looking set of handstand press-ups against a wall.

And it all came during the week she was surging to glory at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati. 

Hands on the prize: Williams shows off her new Cincinnati title after defeating Ana Ivanovic

The 17-time grand slam champion needed only 62 minutes to beat Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-1 in the final on Sunday to secure her first title in the competiton.

After winning five out of eight possible grand slam titles from 2012-13, Williams is yet to add to that tally so far this season, even failing to make it to a quarter-final in Australia, the French Open or Wimbledon.

But she will still head into the US Open starting next Monday as defending champion and one of the favourites to win the title for the third time in a row and the sixth time overall.
