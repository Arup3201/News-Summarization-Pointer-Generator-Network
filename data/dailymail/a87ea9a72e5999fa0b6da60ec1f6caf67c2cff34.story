A smorgasbord if more modern delicacies such as lobster tails and luxury salads are becoming customary staples on the Christmas table.

Almost half of the 1,000 surveyed mums - 43 per cent - say food options have become more up market compared since 10 years ago.

The survey also reveals social and food occasions are becoming more popular while the significance of gifts is on the decline.

As a result, Aussie are spending more during the Christmas season as they're celebrating over a longer period of time compared to a decade ago.

They include picnics at carol singing events, family gatherings at the beach and decorating the house or tree.

Back in 2012, Christmas celebrations were shorter and families spent an average of $170. 

Most mothers said they try to save money by keeping an eye out for special deals and stocking up during the weeks before Christmas

But there are distinct trends for being thrifty, as most mothers say they save money by keeping an eye out for special deals, stocking up during the weeks before Christmas or by doing the Christmas shop gradually.

This comes after a global Christmas survey of over 12,000 people by Groupon showed that 35 per cent of Australians admitted they buy gifts out of pure obligation.

The average Australian will not only purchase at least three obli-gifts this Christmas season, but they'll spend about $150 doing so, amounting to $855 million worth of obli-gifts being received across the country.

At least 57 per cent of Australians, most of them no doubt on the receiving end of an obli-gift, admitted to re-gifting an unwanted present.

Meanwhile, about 55 per cent of respondents who forgot someone on their present list, confess that they prefer to lie, with the most popular excuse being that the receivers non-existent present had been bought online, with the post office copping the blame.
