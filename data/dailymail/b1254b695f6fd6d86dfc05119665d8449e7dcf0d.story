A romantic proposal is enough to leave anyone feeling breathless - especially if, like these couples, you're entirely submerged in water. 

These beautiful images feature spouses-to-be embracing in a crystal clear pool,  posing in evening gowns and black tie  to announce they're tying the knot in an inventive alternative to the traditional engagement picture.

They are the work of US underwater photographer Adam Opris from Florida, who said: 'The year 2015 is bringing in so many new trends that are innovative, fun, and unique. One of those new trends that I am starting with my clients is an underwater engagement shoot.'

Florida-based photographer Adam Opris shoots artistic pictures of couples underwater in an alternative to the traditional engagement photo

Adam Opris's photography has seen him use various challenging props such as a bunch of red balloons under the water

'My couples are diving into the new year to express themselves and immortalise their love in a whole new medium.'

Adam, who also creates ethereal underwater portraits of pregnant women, will help bring the couples' engagement visions to life.

He said: 'Whether my clients are into high-end fashion with Louis Vuitton’s, the exciting world of Harry Potter or even a Steampunk lifestyle, we are creating art on a whole new level to celebrate their uniqueness and engagement.'

In one mesmerising photo, a woman in a white dress looks like she's floating through the sky as she holds a bunch of red balloons as sunlight penetrates the water and breaks through a mass of fluffy white clouds.

Many duos have worn their smartest outifts - the men in suits, the women in brightly coloured long gowns, that billow in the water - to be photographed sharing  a tender kiss, their hair streaming out behind them.

Adam said: 'Every couple that comes to me looking for something different and unique always has a story. I love bringing each person’s character into the photo shoot and letting them show me what makes them unique as a couple.

Most couples wear their finest clothes, like this bride-to-be in flowing red gown and strappy gold heels and her fiance who wears a tuxedo

Opris allows each couple to express their characters through their photographs with each of his images seeing a unique and personal theme 

'By putting them into the water, there are so many fun things we can do with the near weightless environment that would not be possible in a standard engagement shoot.'

This is shown to best advantage in the snaps of couples floating in the water, swimming towards each other, or one man holding his apparently feather-light fiancée on his knee.

The photographer, from Fort Lauderdale, has always had a passion for water and says: 'I’ve practically lived in the ocean my whole life. I am an adrenaline junkie who loves to travel.'

Opris's images vary from the very romantic to the comical depending on the couple's style, this pair chose a morning routine as their theme

Opris said he can create a far greater variety of fun images in this near weightless environment than with a standard engagement shoot

Although most couples choose to buy outfits specifically for the shoot Opris says some have worn designer pieces from Prada and Armani

Opris says he was taught the tricks of the trade by a world-renowned fashion photographer. 

'I have traveled all over the world photographing the beauty in people, places, and animals everywhere I could,' he said.

Despite the underwater setting Opris says that his photo shoots see some couples dressed to the nines to perfect their engagement pictures.

'Most couples do not wear their best clothes but actually buy clothing for the shoot. I do have some couples that have shot in very high end fashion such as Prada or Armani. 

'As long as the clothes are dry-cleaned they do not get ruined.'

The photographer has dealt with several different themes, including this Steampunk couple who added  Victorian elements to their shoot

Other couples have been even more inventive incorporating their favourite films, such as Harry Potter into the final image 

Opris recommended that women only wear minimal make-up to be photographed underwater such as waterproof mascara and lipstick

Opris has captured some classically romantic images  underwater, here both couples appear to be sharing a passionate embrace as they dance

Opris has photographed dozens of couples but he said he still sees a unique side to every image as each individual pair brings their own character to the shoot.

'This is all about the couple celebrating each other in their own style. Some bring costumes underwater, others bring their Manolo Blahniks,' he said.

'The shoots are a lot of fun. Most couples end up feeling like kids again being able to play in the water with their clothes on!'

Opris has photographed dozens of couples but says very pair bring their own unique side and interests to their engagement shoot

Opris said that he aims to bring 'love and fun' to his photo shoots, with the shots of fully clothed couples posing entirely submerged

Opris says he has seen a real rise in demand for his unique underwater photography, in which couples have fun posing together
