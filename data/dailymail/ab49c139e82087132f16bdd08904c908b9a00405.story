Mr Miliband¿s Treasury team, under shadow chancellor Ed Balls, will today cite a new YouGov poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises

Workers are on average earning £1,350 a year less in real terms than when David Cameron came to office in May 2010, figures show.

Labour will try to revive Ed Miliband’s stumbling leadership with an assault on the rising cost of living under the Coalition.

And they will publish a poll showing that 81 per cent of voters believe prices have grown quicker over the last year than their household incomes.

They will contrast that with official figures showing that bonuses in financial services soared in April by 82 per cent compared to the year before as bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in the pound which came into effect that month.

The media blitz comes amid growing concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband has let the Tories and Lib Dems set the political agenda over recent weeks.

The Labour leader has gone on holiday to France and given up his mobile phone, so colleagues can only contact him through his wife Justine.

Yesterday Labour MP Graham Stringer complained: ‘Labour’s shadow cabinet is almost invisible in repose when it’s an ideal time to attack ministers who are on the beach. It’s a huge mistake and it’s not good enough. We need to be energetic, not slumbering.’

The new line of attack on living standards is an admission that Labour’s previous economic attacks on the lack of growth are defunct now that the economy is recovering.

Mr Miliband’s Treasury team, under shadow chancellor Ed Balls, will today cite a new YouGov poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises, as George Osborne claimed last month, are ‘out of touch’.

The survey also found that 70 per cent believe recent improvements in the economy have not benefited middle and lower income families.

Cost of living: Inflation is still more than 2.5 per cent, compared to wage rises of around 1.5 per cent

Shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: ‘Working people know they are worse off under the Tories as prices continue to rise faster than wages.

'Families have also seen their tax credits and childcare support stripped back while David Cameron has prioritised a tax cut for millionaires.

‘The overwhelming majority of people rightly think that Ministers like George Osborne, who claim that families are better off, are totally out of touch. This may feel like a recovery for those at the top, but for everyone else life is getting harder.’

She spoke out as a Survation poll found 53 per cent of Labour supporters agreed Miliband is ‘hesitant.’ Narly half, 48 per cent said he is ‘trying to find himself’, 45 per cent called him ‘lacklustre’ and 37 per cent ‘confused.’

In a further challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, Mr Miliband has been summoned to crisis talks with the 15 unions who give money to Labour over his reforms to the relationship between party and paymasters.

But the plan, which will end the automatic payment of fees from unions to Labour, has been dismissed as ‘gamble’ that will leave Labour’s finances in ‘mayhem’.

Ian Lavery, who chairs the trade union group of Labour MPs, said he believed fewer than 15 per cent of union members would opt to join Labour under the changes, costing the party at least £9 million.

‘It will create mayhem for the party’s finances. We should have avoided that at all costs.

‘This is the biggest political gamble in the history of the Labour Party. It has been described as a challenge - it’s not. It’s a gamble. People are not queuing up to join Labour - quite the opposite. They are waiting to see what the party will bring to the table in its manifesto.

Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, also called for more aggression from Mr Miliband, saying he should emulate the pugnacious American General George S. Patton from the Second World War.

‘Ed Miliband could do with a bit more General Patton in him. Yes he’s been tough enough to challenge his brother, to cut his ties with Gordon Brown and now to take on Len McCluskey and the unions. They all feel well and truly slapped.

‘But it’s time Ed shouted about it. People who think he’s not strong or decisive enough to be Prime Minister need to see the evidence.’
