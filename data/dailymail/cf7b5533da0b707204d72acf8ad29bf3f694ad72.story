Swansea remain in talks with Napoli over a £7million bid for Argentina international Federico Fernandez. 

The centre-back, who played four times at the World Cup for Alejandro Sabella's side, has been lined up by Garry Monk as a replacement for Chico Flores, who looks set to be reunited with former Swans boss Michael Laudrup at Qatari club Lekwiya. 

Fernandez joined Napoli in 2011 for Argentine side Estudiantes, though he was shipped out to Getafe on loan for the 2012-13 campaign.

International pedigree: Napoli defender Federico Fernandez, left, played four times for Argentina at World Cup

Strong in the tackle: The 25-year-old has spent three seasons at Napoli, although one was on loan to Getafe

Florez, meanwhile, is understood to have already said goodbye to his Swansea team-mates ahead of his move to the Middle East. 

Swansea have signed Swedish Under-17 international midfielder Adnan Maric and Daniel James, 16, another midfielder from Hull City. 

Elsewhere Norwich are interested in Falkirk's Will Vaulks, while Reading have secured Jamie Mackie on loan from Nottingham Forest. 

In other loan news, Crewe are signing Manchester City left-back Greg Leigh.

Last appearance: If he leaves, Flores' last competitive game will have seen him red carded against Chelsea

Defensive strength: Flores has been a key component of Swansea's side since signing in 2012 for £2million
