Israeli airstrikes killed two militants and a schoolboy in the Gaza Strip today as Palestinian rocket squads continued to bombard Israel.

The cross-border violence, started by Israel's killing of a top militant leader on Friday, has been the worst exchange of fire between Israel and the Hamas-ruled territory in months.

The fighting so far has killed 21 Gazans, including 18 militants, seriously wounded two Israelis, and disrupted the lives of a million Israelis living within the range of Gaza rockets.

And Israel claimed the damage could have been even worse were it not for its newly introduced Iron Dome missile defence system.

It claimed the technology had intercepted dozens of rockets since the clashes erupted.

The Israeli military said it carried out nine air attacks against rocket-launching sites and a weapons storage facility today.

Islamic Jihad said two of its militants were killed in two separate raids, one while he was riding a motorcycle.

A 16-year-old boy wearing a school uniform was killed when a group of five civilians was struck in another attack, Gaza health official Adham Abu Salmia said.

More than 20 Palestinians, including several children, were wounded in a separate pre-dawn strike in Gaza City, he added.

Chief Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai said the raid had targeted munitions that were stored in a residential building.

The military said the air attacks came in response to continued rocket fire.

Schools in the area were closed for a second day to avoid casualties; a day earlier, a rocket struck the courtyard of one of the empty schools.

Militants also fired three mortar shells into Kerem Shalom, the sole cargo crossing between Israel and Gaza and the conduit for 70 per cent of all goods that enter the Palestinian territory.

Two vehicles were hit on the Palestinian side of the crossing, but there were no injuries. Operations were halted for about half an hour before resuming.

But although the violence shows no immediate signs of subsiding, both Hamas and Israel seem eager to avoid the kind of all-out war that erupted three years ago.

In keeping with its practice since that conflict, Hamas has stayed out of the current clashes, for fear of provoking a harsh Israeli retaliation.

But it has not stopped other, smaller Gaza factions from attacking Israel, and Israel continues to hold it ultimately responsible for any violence emanating from Gaza.
