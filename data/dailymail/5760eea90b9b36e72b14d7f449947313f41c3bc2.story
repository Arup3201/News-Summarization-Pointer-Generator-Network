The son of football pundit Trevor Francis appeared in court today charged with stealing thousands of pounds of designer clothes from the home of a former England footballer.

James Francis, 24, denies breaking into the £1.7m Warwickshire mansion of ex-England star Lee Hendrie and stealing clothes including Jimmy Choo shoes and a diamond earring.

Mr Francis, who was today accompanied to court by his famous footballing father, allegedly broke into the sprawling property in the leafy Midlands village of Rowington.

Trevor looked on during a brief court hearing today, where details of his son's alleged offence emerged.

It is alleged the ex semi-professional
footballer broke into one of the two cottages on site which was being 
used as a storeroom.

A pair of Jimmy Choo shoes, one diamond earring and a luxury Veru smartphone are among the items allegedly stolen.

He is also accused of taking golf 
clubs, a pair of Roberto Cavalli boots, designer sunglasses, Gucci 
boots, a Versace watch, a Gucci clutch bag and Dolce and Gabbana boots.

Other items allegedly taken in the 
haul in Finwood Lawn, Rowington, Warks, included a jewellery box 
containing costume jewellery and six souvenir football shirts.

Francis, from Solihull, West Mids, denies one count of burglary between July 8 and July 31 last year.

Judge Marten Coates bailed Francis and ordered him to return to the same court for trial on October 8.

Francis’ father Trevor became the game’s first £1 million player when he left Birmingham City for Nottingham Forest in 1979.

Luxurious: A bar and sitting area in Hendrie's property, which he was not in at the time of the alleged burglary

Plush: A swimming pool at Hendrie's mansion, Finwood Lawn, which the ex-England star is now trying to sell

The striker then won the European Cup with the club later that year - scoring the winning goal in the final - managed by legendary football boss Brian Clough.

He had an illustrious career for club and country, making 52 appearances for England and scoring 12 goals.

Hendrie bought the sprawling property in the leafy Midlands village of Rowington in 2006 for £1.6 million.

Costly: Former Aston Villa player Hendrie bought the property for £1.6m in 2006, but is now looking to sell the mansion

The 34-year-old, whose main home is in Solihull, West Mids, is now trying to sell the property, set in 3.5 acres with views of Warwickshire’s countryside, for GBP1.7 million.

Hendrie, whose passion for wearing a sparkling diamond earring became his trademark with fans, was not at the property at the time of the break-in.

The gated property boasts six bedrooms, five bathrooms, an indoor swimming pool and an open-plan contemporary area - which includes a lounge, dining room and sitting room with oak stair case.

Hendrie, who currently plays for non-league Kidderminster Harriers, made his name at Aston Villa, playing more than 250 times for the Midlands club between 1995 and 2007.
