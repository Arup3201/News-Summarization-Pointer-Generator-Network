Kim, 27, caused a storm of controversy after she was caught out on national television, unleashing a torrent of swear words during the semis. 

Ms Sears, who looked fresh and natural as she made her way through the airport today, earned plaudits as she attended the final in a jumper that humorously declared: 'parental advisory: explicit content.'

Today, a make-up free Kim swapped her much talked about T-shirt for a cosy grey jumper, jeans, a colourful print scarf and her favourite French Sole leopard pumps. 

She wore her famous glossy locks in a relaxed ponytail and greeted a waiting friend with a kiss.

The usually reserved Kim became an internet sensation over the past week when she wore a black T-shirt branded with the phrase 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content'.

Moments after the Channel Seven camera first showed Ms Sears' hilarious response to her critics, social media erupted with messages of approval. 

Within ten minutes, the young painter was trending worldwide, receiving praise for her self deprecating sense of humour.  

Novak Djokovic went on to defeat Andy Murray in an intense four-set battle, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-0, to claim his fifth Australian Open title.

In response to the backlash over Sear's foulmouthed rant, her father jokingly joined in with the international condemnation, calling it 'disgraceful behaviour'.

Nigel Sears, a coach and pundit, was asked about his daughter's expletive-filled tirade as she watched fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday.

The 57-year-old joked: 'she's always had a potty mouth - gets it from her mother of course' before expressing his surprise that Miss Sears' 'feisty' support had created such a furore.

Speaking to EuroSport, he said: 'Quite amazing how much has been made of this - but it's pretty emotional in that box when you're close to someone... and it was a feisty match.

'They've been together a long time, and it just goes with the territory. Andy's a huge figure in the game, so naturally her association with him means there's always going to be a certain spotlight on Kim.

'I think by and large she deals with it extremely well.I think people are reading a lot into this.' 

Miss Sears sent Twitter into meltdown after the usually poised blonde appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych in one of several heated moments during the clash.

As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k'.

The clip, which was recorded after the camera zoomed in on Ms Sears, sparked an online frenzy, with hundreds both amused and shocked by the outburst from Murray's usually-demure other half.

The tennis star quickly jumped to the defence of his fiancée and said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match.

However, the shoe was on the other foot during the final with Ms Sears' fiance launching into an expletive-filled rant during the third set. 

Murray became enraged, screaming swear words and making accusations about his opponent who soon went on to win the set.

'Don't worry about him, he does it all the time,' Murray repeatedly told the chair umpire when Djokovic complained about an injury.

'Jesus, f***! F***,' Murray repeatedly yelled, clearly forgetting the backlash his fiancee faced for using the same word. 

'So unhelpful! It's so unhelpful. So unhelpful,' Murray proceeded to rant inexplicably.
