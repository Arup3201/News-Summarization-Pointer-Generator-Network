Michael Schumacher's sponsors Navyboot and Jet Set have severed all commercial ties with the Formula One legend almost a year after his skiing accident in December 2013.

The seven-time champion will lose about £4million a year by being dropped by the fashion firms less than a month after former racing driver Philippe Streiff announced Schumacher was 'paralysed, wheelchair-bound and unable to speak'.

A spokesman for Phillipe Gaydoul, owner of Navyboot and Jet Set, confirmed the decision to end the 45-year-old coma victim's lucrative contract.

It comes after German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with him.

It is not yet clear which other companies have severed their links with Schumacher, though Mercedes and wealth management firm DVAG have promised to stand by the F1 star. 

'It is not easy for Schumacher's sponsors: paying out millions of Swiss francs per year and receiving nothing back since the crash,' said Swiss news website Bluewin.

'But must they separate in this situation from the Formula 1 legend? It is a balancing act: on the one hand, the sponsors must pursue economic objectives, which point towards for a parting. 

'On the other hand it will not be well received in public if you are turning your back on Schumacher at this difficult time.'

Schumacher is currently being cared for by a team of specialists in a state-of-the-art medical suite built inside his £35m mansion near Lake Geneva. 

He was on holiday with family and friends in French Alps ski resort Meribel when he fell and his head struck a rock. Schumacher was airlifted after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specialises in head injuries.

He arrived at 12.40pm and was placed in an artificial coma, before being operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

It was announced in January that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm revealed  he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'.

He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment.
