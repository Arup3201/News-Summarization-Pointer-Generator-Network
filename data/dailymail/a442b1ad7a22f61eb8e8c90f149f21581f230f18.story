A married couple say they are facing financial ruin after they were landed with a £73,000 electricity bill in error - and were ordered to pay it.

Despite their electricity supplier 
admitting to the mistake, Sean and Catherine Coleman have been told an astronomical underpayment must be met after they were undercharged for five 
years.

The couple, who run a bar in Leeds, were unknowingly undercharged by a British Gas consumption meter for five years - an error to which the company has admitted.

Astronomical: Sean Coleman with the electricity bill which, he says, will ruin his business if they are forced to pay it

However, the energy company has insisted the underpayment must be met - despite the fact it was its fault.

Sean, who runs the Sandbar in the Horsforth area of Leeds, West Yorks., said: 'It's an amount we can't afford and it's not our error.'

The dad-of-three said they had been paying more than £4,000 a year broken up into quarters for the past five years.

He added: 'They were reasonable amounts of money we were paying, we weren't hiding behind £15 bills and just not saying anything. We didn't realise there was an issue.'

The 44-year-old has been running the 
bar for the past 11 years and in 2006 the business expanded. The changes
included the introduction of a new electricity meter.

However
in August the couple received a received the ultimate red letter from 
British Gas saying the meter readings taken over the five-year period 
hadn't been used to create their bills.

Error: The letter informing the Colemans there had been a mistake (left) and the bill (right) for almost £73,000 

The worried businessman said the bill for £72,788.04 had since been revised to £58,000, but said this was still 'unachievable'.

Sean said: 'It's been terrible, stress, sleepless nights, it could put us out of business. Eleven years of hard work could be shattered.

'I have been with British Gas 11 years and to have this debt suddenly land on your doorstep is utterly amazing.'

In its original letter to the Colemans, British Gas said: 'We're sorry there was a mistake with some of your invoices.

'As soon as we realised our mistake we put it right. The actual meter readings that have been provided were not used to create your bills.

'I understand that this additional 
cost was unexpected so I want to make payment terms fair and as 
hassle-free as possible. So interest charges will, of course, be 
waived.'

Sean said: 
'Apparently actual readings that have been phoned through by ourselves 
and taken by official meter reading personnel have been ignored by 
British Gas' central computer and have been continually estimated for 
the past five years.

Fears: The couple say they could end up losing the business they spent 11 years building up because of the error by British Gas

'The data is imputed into the computer and it deems to estimate to be too high and produces a lower estimate, which we got. This happened every time over the past five years.

'If the bills had been correct they would have been involved in our cashflow and we'd have paid accordingly.

'They offered us two choices, either to pay up in full of over three years, but to pay the money back over that time is unachievable.

'They've made a mistake over the last five years. I think it would be only courtesy to offer us the same amount of time to pay back the debt, or maybe more.

'Catherine has taken time off work, suffered sleepless nights, stress, anxiety made trips to the doctor. I think I am putting a braver face on at the moment.'

Catherine, 40, who lives with her husband and three daughters, Tiger-lily, seven, Leia, five and Natasha, three, said: 'It is an extremely worrying situation to be in for a small business during the recession.

'I'm anxious all the time about how we are going to pay this huge bill. We are trying to get through the recession and to have to concentrate on something like this on top, it feels like the last straw.'

Sean said he was contacted by the the customer service department of British Gas who want to sent somebody round to inspect the meter and talk about the bill.

A British Gas spokeswoman said: 'I am very sorry to hear about Mr Coleman's situation.

'We are investigating this case fully as a matter of urgency and we hope to come to a mutually acceptable arrangement with Mr Coleman following this investigation.'
