The New York Times company said it will proceed with its plan for Mark Thompson to take over as CEO today despite an intensifying scandal at the BBC which raised questions about his tenure at Britain's flagship broadcasting company.

The firm's leading paper, The New York Times, has maintained its confidence in the new chief following news that Mr Thompson's successor, George Entwistle, the director-general of the BBC, had resigned on Saturday.

Entwistle took the blame for a news program on the BBC's Newsnight programme, which aired a mistaken allegation that a former British senior politician sexually abused a child at a care home.

The latest embarrassment comes as the BBC faces police and other investigations into claims that hundreds of people, some as young as 12, were sexually abused over the course of decades by one of their top personalities, the late Jimmy Savile.

It is also facing awkward questions over how the same Newsnight program - while Thompson was director-general - killed a report that was investigating complaints against the presenter and instead aired laudatory shows commemorating Savile after he died last year.

Mr Thompson said he did not know about the nature of the investigation by Newsnight into Savile, and had no involvement in the decision to axe the report.

He later said he had a 'chance meeting' with a journalist who mentioned the Newsnight investigation into Savile, but said he had not been told any of the details or the scale of the problem.

Entwistle's departure and his acceptance of responsibility for editorial decisions as director-general, adds pressure to any evaluation of Thompson's role at the BBC and whether he was ultimately accountable for the shelving of the Savile report.

But a New York Times spokesman said yesterday: 'He is going to be CEO beginning November 12.'

Thompson did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Entwistle's resignation.

Earlier, he declined to be interviewed about his plans for the New York Times.

Entwistle stood down after it emerged that Newsnight had aired allegations by a child abuse victim which led to former Conservative Party treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as a paedophile.

Lord McAlpine had always denied any involvement and says he will now sue those who made the false allegations.

Following Entwistle's departure, two more senior BBC staff today 'stepped aside' as the crisis at the corporation deepens.

BBC News director Helen Boaden and her 
deputy Stephen Mitchell follow Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, who also 
'stepped aside' last month following a shelved probe into Jimmy Savile's
sex abuse.

The duo are expected to eventually return, but it comes just two days after the dramatic resignation of the Corporation's director general George Entwistle on Saturday after only seven weeks in the job.

Meanwhile BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten was fighting for his job today as it emerged he had known of Newsnightâ€™s disastrous plan to link a senior Tory to child abuse before the show aired.

Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific sex abusers, with hundreds of possible victims.

The Metropolitan Police is leading a national investigation into the Jim'll Fix It Star's activities and pursuing hundreds of lines of inquiry.

Former pop star Gary Glitter, 68, comedian Freddie Starr, 69, and a BBC producer have so far been arrested.

They all deny the allegations.
