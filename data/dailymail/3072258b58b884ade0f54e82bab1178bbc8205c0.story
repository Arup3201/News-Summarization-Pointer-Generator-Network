One of CERN's most senior physicists this afternoon announced firm evidence for the existence of the elusive Higgs Boson, or God particle.

Although the signal doesn't meet strict scientific standards for a 'full scientific discovery', it's still enough for researchers at CERN'S Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to predict a discovery next year.

Two separate teams of scientists have been running 
independent experiments in secret from each other in order to improve 
the veracity of the results with the team leader of one, Fabiola Gianotti, proclaiming that they believe they've found signs of the Higgs boson in the past year.

The existence of the Higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass.

Theory has it that as the universe cooled after the Big Bang, an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed.

This field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or Higgs bosons.

As other particles pass through it, they pick up mass.

Any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the Higgs boson 
will be long term, but they could be felt in fields as diverse as medicine, 
computing and manufacturing.

Experts compare the search for the Higgs boson to the discovery of the electron.

The idea of the electron – a subatomic particle – was first floated in 
1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years.

A century on, the electron’s existence underpins modern science. Our 
understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from 
television and CDs to radiotherapy for cancer patients.

'We have built a solid foundation for the months ahead,' she said.

UK particle physicist Tara Shears was also upbeat, saying that the results represented 'exciting times' with 'more to come'.

Professor Stefan Soldner-Rembold, a particle physicist from the University of Manchester, told MailOnline: 'ATLAS and CMS [the two detectors in the hunt for Higgs] have presented an important milestone in their search for the Higgs particle, but it is not yet sufficient for a proper discovery given the amount of data recorded so far.

'Still, I am very excited about it, since the quality of the LHC results is exceptional.'

CERN was cautious: 'The main conclusion is that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 116-130 GeV [a unit of energy equal to billion electron volts] by the ATLAS experiment, and 115-127 GeV by CMS.

'Tantalising hints have been seen by both experiments in this mass region, but these are not yet strong enough to claim a discovery.

'Higgs bosons, if they exist, are very short lived and can decay in many different ways. Discovery relies on observing the particles they decay into rather than the Higgs itself. Both ATLAS and CMS have analysed several decay channels, and the experiments see small excesses in the low mass region that has not yet been excluded.'

The upshot of the experiments, therefore, is that researchers believe the Higgs is fairly lightweight, which could lead to more exciting discoveries, according to New Scientist's Lisa Grossman.

She wrote: 'A Higgs of this mass, about 125 gigaelectronvolts, would blast a path to uncharted terrain. Such a lightweight would need at least one new type of particle to stabilise it.'

When looking at results, the scale of certainty used by researchers is the sigma, something peculiar to particle physics.

Researchers need a five-sigma level of certainty to make a bona-fide 
formal discovery, which means there’s only a one in a million chance 
that the result is a statistical error.

Scientists only formally acknowledge an experiment’s results if they hit a 
three sigma level, which means there’s only a 1 in 370 chance of them 
being a fluke.

The sigma probabilities announced today for the Higgs hunt have not been combined, but the overall ATLAS result was 2.3.

Before the press conference began, CERN described the room as 'full to the rafters. People would hang from the lamps if the security guards would let them'.

The Higgs boson is regarded – by those who know about such things – as 
the key to understanding the universe. Its job is, apparently, to give 
the particles that make up atoms their mass.

Without this mass, these 
particles would zip though the cosmos at the speed of light, unable to 
bind together to form the atoms that make up everything in the universe,
 from planets  to people.

The Higgs boson’s existence was predicted in 1964 by Edinburgh 
University physicist Peter Higgs. But it has eluded previous searchers –
 so much so that not all scientists believe in its existence.

The hunt for the Higgs boson was one of the LHC's major tasks.

The collider, housed in an 18-mile tunnel buried deep underground near 
the French-Swiss border, smashes beams of protons – sub-atomic particles
 – together at close to the speed of light, recreating the conditions 
that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

If the physicists’ theory is correct, a few Higgs bosons should be 
created in every trillion collisions, before rapidly decaying.

This decay would leave behind a ‘footprint’ that would show up as a bump in their graphs.

The CMS – or Compact Muon Solenoid –  is a 13,000-ton machine that sits 
330 feet underground, while the ATLAS, at 148 feet long and 82 feet 
high, is the biggest detector ever constructed.
