Actor Sean Bean has been told he will not be prosecuted after being arrested on suspicion of harassing his former wife.

The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones star, 53, was arrested over claims he sent abusive texts and calls to actress Georgina Sutcliffe.

But Sheffield-born Bean, who lives in north London, has been told the matter would not be pursued further.

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed: 'He was told he would face no further action.'

The actor was questioned by police in
May over claims he made abusive phone calls and sent text messages to 
34-year-old Miss Sutcliffe.

Bean,
a father of three who made his name in ITV’s Napoleonic drama Sharpe 
before starring in Hollywood blockbuster Lord of the Rings, handed 
himself in to Holborn police station in central London in May for a 
pre-arranged interview.

He gave DNA and fingerprint samples and was bailed as officers continued to investigate the claims.

Miss Sutcliffe, who is acting in Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap in the West End, was Bean’s fourth wife.

The pair met in 2003 when she was managing the bar at a West End theatre where Bean was playing Macbeth.

They married at Marylebone Register Office in London in 2008 and shared a house in Belsize Park, north London, but reportedly separated in the first year of their marriage, before getting back together. Two years later they divorced, citing ‘irreconcilable differences’.

Bean was previously married to hairdresser Debra James and actresses Melanie Hill and Abigail Cruttenden.

He wed school sweetheart Miss James when he was just 21, but their marriage collapsed after he moved from Sheffield to London to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. They divorced in 1988.

The actor was then married to Miss Hill for seven years, and had two daughters. Soon after they split, he confirmed he was dating Miss Cruttenden, who he met on the set of Sharpe. They had a daughter in 1998, but divorced two years later.

Last year the actor said that he had finally given up on marriage, saying he preferred spending his time gardening.
