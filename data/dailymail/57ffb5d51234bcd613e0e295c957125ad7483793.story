If you thought your home was full of junk, it's got some stiff competition.

The University of Brighton's Waste House is made entirely of recycled products, scrap and unused materials from construction sites.

Some 4,000 VHS cassettes, two tons of jeans and 20,000 toothbrushes are just some of the items used for the building. Its architects hope to prove that such matter can compete with more 
established, high-energy, high-carbon counterparts.

Not so clean living: The University of Brighton's Waste House is made of recycled materials and waste

Impressive: 4,000 VHS cassettes, two tons of jeans and 20,000 toothbrushes are just some of the items used to construct the building

Old 
toothbrushes – many used just once by business class and first class 
passengers flying from Gatwick – have been used in the wall cavities.

Chalk waste and clay were mixed to create the walls, 500 bike 
tyres were used to seal windows and soundproof the first floor, while 2,000
 used carpet tiles cover the floor and walls, reports Refinery 29.

Old vinyl banners were 
used as internal vapour control layers.

The project is the brainchild of Duncan Baker-Brown, architect and architectural researcher at the University of Brighton Faculty of Arts.

Genius: Video cassettes have been slotted into wall cavities to help with insulation in the house

Waste not: 10 tonnes of chalk waste mixed 10 per cent of clay create the walls, which are covered with tiles, left, while recycled products, such as this light fitting, right, make up the rest of Brighton's Waste House

He is 
conducting an experiment into eco-friendly living and seeing if waste 
materials can serve as the sole insulation in walls.

According Baker-Brown, the idea is ‘that there is no such thing as waste, just stuff in the wrong place.’

The project is based on the building that Baker-Brown created in 2008 with Kevin McCloud from Channel 4's Grand Designs show.

The 2008 version of the house- ‘House That Kevin Built' -  was the UK's first contemporary low-energy prefabricated house built using entirely ecologically friendly materials.

‘We have, with our students, been designing, re-designing and developing new methods of sustainable construction and new ways of using materials in order to create a truly contemporary representation of the constantly evolving ideas in this field,’ says Baker-Brown.

Brush of genius: Old toothbrushes are used to fill cavities in walls instead of teeth

Work began on Brighton’s Waste House in April and by June the dwelling was open for public viewing.

Over the next few years, university students 
will observe the quality of the exterior walls to see if plastic can act as a
 sustainable insulation material.

Thrown-away

 bricks, ply sheets and wood from other construction projects, as well 
as old plastic razors, denim jeans, DVDs and video cassettes, have been
 slotted into wall cavities as insulation, 
and will be monitored to see how efficient they 
are.

The Brighton Waste House aims to prove that low-carbon materials can compete effectively with their more established high-energy, high-carbon counterparts.

When fully completed, it will be one of the first A* energy-efficient rated sustainable buildings in the UK.
