The Oscar curse suggests that winners of the award will be destined for misfortune as soon as they get their hands on that golden statue.

Nicholas Cage, Halle Berry and Kirk Douglas and  have all been victims, as has Sam Mendes and Sandra Bullock.

And for male actors in particular, that misfortune is likely to be romantic rather than professional, according to a new study.

The Oscar curse suggests that winners of the award will be destined for misfortune as soon as they get their hands on that golden statue. Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes announced their divorce a year after she won the Best Actress Oscar for The Reader in 2009

The research, led by University of Michigan, found that the sudden shift in fortunes can have a damaging impact on relationships.

'Since many aspects of our lives are organised as winner-take-all tournaments, it's necessary to be aware of the potential downsides,' Michael Jensen, a strategy professor at Michigan's Ross School of Business.

They found specialising in action films increases the divorce rate of male actors, but not the divorce rate of female actors

The Oscar curse goes back to the 1930s and Hollywood's golden age. 

Luise Rainer, the first actor to win multiple Oscars, blamed her wins for 'The Great Ziegfeld' in 1936 and 'The Good Earth' in 1937, for the rapid decline of her career.

Professor Jensen and co-author Heeyon Kim of the National University of Singapore, found no evidence of negative professional consequences for male or female actors. 

The study confirmed there are fewer roles for female actors than male actors.

Married male actors participate in more movies than divorced male actors, whereas divorced female actors participate in more movies than married female actors.

Hollywood is not ready for female action heroes: Specialising in action films increases movie participation for male actors but decreases movie participation for female actors.

Male action heroes are more likely to divorce: Specializing in action films increases the divorce rate of male actors, but not the divorce rate of female actors.

Male actors, but not female actors, are more likely to divorce if their spouse is nominated for or wins an Oscar.

Oscar winners appear, on average, in more films following their wins than Oscar nominees and other actors.

'The professional Oscar curse is, in other words, only a Hollywood myth,' Professor Jensen said. 'The personal consequences of the Oscars are different.'

The researchers looked at overall divorce rates of Oscar winners and nominees, and found that they weren't all that different from other actors. 

However, they found that male actors who won an Oscar were three times as likely - and nominees were twice as likely - as other male actors to divorce during their first year of marriage. 

Female Oscar winners and nominees were much less likely to divorce than other female actors.

The team came to the conclusion after examining all actors who played lead roles in 1,023 top commercial and top artistic films from 1930 to 2005 - a sample of 808 actors that included 165 Oscar winners and 227 Oscar nominees who did not win.

They analysed male and female elite actors separately because the labor markets and Oscar success criteria for male and female screen actors are different.

'Our results emphasise an important conundrum for male actors - Oscar nominations/wins can help a career but can also ruin a marriage,' Professor Jensen said.

They also found that male actors, but not female actors, are more likely to divorce if their spouse is nominated for or wins an Oscar. 

However, a separate study in 2011 found that the Best Actress winners were more likely to end up divorced than others who had been nominated but failed to win a gold statuette.

Researchers at the University of Toronto in Canada found that female winners of the top acting award have a 63 per cent chance of having a shorter marriage than non winners.

At the time, British star Kate Winslet, Sandra Bullock and Hilary Swank are all among the most recent winners who saw their careers hit new heights but their personal lives go in the opposite direction.

A year after winning the Best Actress award playing a concentration camp guard in The Reader in 2009 her marriage to director Sam Mendes ended.

A separate study in 2011 found that the Best Actress winners were more likely to end up divorced than others who had been nominated but failed to win a gold statuette. Halle Berry (pictured) and husband Eric Benet split three years after she won the Oscar for Monsters Ball in 2002
