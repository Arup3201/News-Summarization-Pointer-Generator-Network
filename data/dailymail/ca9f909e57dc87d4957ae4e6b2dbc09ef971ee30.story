New Zealand police have apologised after assuming that a driver stopped on a rural Coromandel highway for driving with a kayak strapped sideways on its roof was an Irish tourist.

District Road Policing Manager, Inspector Freda Grace, said that when the officer stopped the man on SH25 to speak to him about the danger his kayak was posing to other road users, the man's accent made her assume he was Irish, and so was not aware of the road laws in the country. 

The 'Irish' driver was stopped by Waikato Police for driving with his kayak lying sideways across his car's roof

'Unfortunately we did not check his identity documents and as a result the driver was issued a warning, ordered to remove the kayak and told to head back into town to get suitable transport arranged for the kayak before continuing his journey,' Inspector Grace said in a statement. 

'In this case the officer believed obtaining compliance from the motorist and preventing a crash was a more effective outcome than issuing the driver a fine and she believed she was enhancing foreign relations.'

'Waikato Police wish to offer an unreserved apology to any persons of Irish descent we may have offended,' said Inspector Grace.

New Zealand is renowned for its beauty, not for spotting Irish accents

Mrs Grace said that regardless of the driver's nationality, the main focus of the incident remained road safety and the risks posed by the driver to other road users should not be forgotten.

'After all, over the next couple of weeks the population of the Coromandel is expected to rise from 15,000 to over 130,000. At any one time around 80 per cent of motorists on the region's roads will be visitors of one sought or another and we will all need to drive safe to reach the beach this summer,' she said.
