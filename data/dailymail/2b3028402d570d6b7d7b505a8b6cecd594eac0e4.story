Former President George H.W. Bush remains in stable condition three weeks after he was hospitalized in Houston with bronchitis.

The 88-year-old was admitted to the 
Methodist Hospital on the day after Thanksgiving with a lingering cough 
that doctors feared could develop into pneumonia and he remains a 
patient there.

Though there has been improvement in Bush's condition over the last few days doctors are in no rush to release him, Methodist
Hospital spokesman George Kovacik said Sunday.

Concerns: Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, 88, was hospitalized in Texas on Friday

Bush's stay has been longer than he expected. Shortly after he was hospitalized, his chief of staff, Jean Becker, told the Houston Chronicle that the illness is not life-threatening and Bush was expected to be released by the weekend.

'His big problem is a chronic cough, he can't get rid of so he's back at Methodist,' Becker said. 'We have kept this quiet out of respect for him.'

Bush, the 41st president, has been to Methodist Hospital several times in recent weeks, she said.

'He’s been overdoing it lately,' a family friend told the New York Daily News. 'He’s always been that way but he just doesn’t have the strength anymore to keep it up.'

Four days after being admitted, he was visited by his son, former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.

'President
Bush has been in and out of The Methodist Hospital in the Texas Medical
Center being treated for complications related to his bronchitis,' the 
hospital said in a statement.

'He is in stable condition, and is expected to be released within the next 72 hours.'

revealed

Bush was vice president for two terms under President Ronald Reagan before serving as president from 1989 until 1993.

In
June, his son Jeb Bush, who was governor of Florida for nearly a 
decade, revealed that his father can no longer walk on his own, relying 
on a wheelchair or a walker.

His
family said it has proved frustrating for the man who once enjoyed an 
active lifestyle of jogging, fishing, golf and beach walks near his 
summer home in Maine, ABC reported.

He
has also undergone two hip replacement surgeries at the hospital in 
Houston, where he and Barbara have lived since they left the White 
House.

Longtime Bush friend Jerry Weintraub, 
who produced an HBO documentary about his life, added to Good Morning 
America that Bush has struggled with the symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease.

He recently returned to the White House to see the portrait of his 
son hung close to his own, a ceremony he described as 
filling him with 'awe and wonder'.

He was pictured visiting his former home - which caused 'a lot of memories to come 
flooding back' - in a wheelchair pushed by his wife, Barbara.

In a revealing interview on the Today
show in June, Bush Sr. spoke out about his health struggles and how he 
regretted he would not live to see his granddaughter, Georgia Bush, grow
up.

Speaking with his 
granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager, he said that the one-year-old 'just 
takes me back' and that he wishes he had more time with her.

'She’s a beautiful girl 
and she just takes me back,' he said of Georgia. 'I just wish I were going to be around to see
her grow old. I won’t be.'

But
he added that he is not scared of death as he looks forward to being 
reunited in heaven with daughter Robin, who died of leukemia aged four 
in 1953.

'I think about death,' he said. 'I wonder what it's like. There's people in heaven I want to see, definitely.'
