These revealing images shed light on life inside North Korea, the world's most secretive state.

The images were captured by Björn Bergman, 59, who spent nine days travelling around the nation.

There he saw motorways devoid of any traffic, mass military displays by choreographed troops ,and rural poverty.

He spent two years trying to obtain a visa and once there was whisked around the country on an official tour bus.

His images, which almost didn't see the light of day after his memory card was wiped, show bleak rural life, with lone figures tending to vast expanses of barren farmland.

Others show the giant hammer and sickle statues towering above the eerily empty streets of the capital, Pyongyang.

Meanwhile beneath the city, old fashioned underground carriages carry commuters about their business.

A grand, golden platform is the site of statues and posters of the country's founder Kim Jong-il and his grandson, the current leader Kim Jong-un.

Bergman said: 'My kids and friends thought I was 100 per cent crazy for going to North Korea and asked me to stay at home.

'But North Korea is one of the safest countries for tourists according to the UN.

'The trip was scary, horrible, and beautiful all at the same time.

'We weren't allowed to talk to the natives - they wouldn't even so much as look at us.'

Out in the countryside, Bergman encountered an eight-lane highway - used by just a trickle of traffic.

The lavish structure - which stretches 160km from the capital to the border with South Korea - was built despite estimates putting car ownership in the country at just one per thousand people.

Bergman added: 'My rule as a photographer is shoot first, then ask. The guards were very hostile.

'At the hotels they told us to stay in and would not allow us to leave without guides.

'We tried three times but didn't get further than three metres before they told us to go back.

'During our bus trips, there was three guards and they didn't allow us to take any pictures besides what they asked us to shoot, such as monuments.'

He added: 'I want to go back, but I'm not sure they will let me in again.'
