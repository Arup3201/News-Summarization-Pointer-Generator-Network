He's the real-life Mr. Plow, hailed a hero by his Michigan neighbors.

But unlike Homer Simpson, Battle Creek's Brian Torrey isn't clearing the thick snow from his neighbors' driveways for the accolades or the money.

The 32-year-old just wants to help people out.

Kindhearted: Brian Torrey, 32, has taken it upon himself to clear the thick snow from the driveways of his Michigan neighbors

Generous: Torrey has braved temperatures of   minus 11 degrees in Battle Creek to clear the streets, some of which are covered in up to 17 inches of snow

'When the snow first started to fall here, I noticed I had a couple neighbors that were out here trying to shovel,' he said. 'I decided to fire it up and get out here and start helping people.'

Torrey told FOX 17 Online he convinced his fiancee, Michelle Miller Dykstra, to let him buy the used snowblower in a garage sale last spring. He figured it would come in handy one day.

When the temperature plummeted to -11F over the last week, Torrey decided to pull out the plow.

Donning a face mask to protect his skin from the ice-cold air, Torrey has been clearing Phelps Avenue sidewalks and driveways, unprompted and free of charge, according to Battle Creek Enquirer.

'The snowblower is doing all the work,' the humble Avery Pipeline Services employee said. 'Iâ€™m just trying to help people get somewhere.'

Torrey's kindness has warmed the hearts of his neighbors.

'I was kind of surprised because it's 
been a long time since we've had a neighbor do anything like that,' one said. 'A lot of them don't do their 
sidewalks half the time.'

Torrey said he wished more people were as thoughtful.

'I wish there were more people that 
did stuff like this, you know?' Torrey said. 'You're not out here trying
 to make a buck, you're just trying to help people out.'
