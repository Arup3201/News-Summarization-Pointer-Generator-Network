Boston Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster has been dealt a five-game suspension for intentionally hitting New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez with the ball.

Major League Baseball vice-president Joe Garagiola Jr announced the penalty on Tuesday after the Red Sox’s defeat on Sunday, and also confirmed that Yankees manager Joe Girardi would be fined for rushing onto the field and arguing with plate umpire Brian O’Nora for failing to eject Dempster.

Dempster threw his fourth pitch at Rodriguez, who is accused of using performance-enhancing steroids.

The ball hit his left elbow pad before 
ricocheting off his back, sparking fury in the Yankees camp as Girardi 
stormed to confront the umpire.

When asked about the incident on Wednesday, Rodriguez was keen to move forward.

'The past is the past,' he said. 'Right now, the most important thing, is our first playoff game starts tonight, and every game is important. The playoffs are what we're thinking about right now. That's the reason why I shut everything down.'

Rodriguez is playing while he appeals 
the 211-game suspension imposed by the MLB as part of the investigation 
into the Biogenesis anti-ageing clinic and the use of 
performance-enhancing drugs.

Meanwhile, Atlanta Braves’ star Jason Heyward suffered a broken jaw in two places when he was struck with the ball.

New York Mets’ Jonathan Niese threw the 90mph pitch which swerved, catching Heyward flush in the face in Wednesday’s game.

Heyward, 24, dropped his bat and hit the deck before being helped to his feet and making his way off the field. 

The Braves man is due to undergo surgery on his jaw on Thursday.
