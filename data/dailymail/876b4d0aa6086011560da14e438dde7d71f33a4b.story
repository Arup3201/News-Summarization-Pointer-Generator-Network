More than 500 Roma people, including more than 70 children, have been evicted from a makeshift camp in Paris.

Police stormed the camp in the suburb of Saint-Ouen this morning, forcing out 250 people. Another 300 who were warned of the evacuation left last night.

It comes amid a fierce crackdown on gipsy sites by French police, and polls which say more than four-fifths of French people want the camps destroyed.

The authorities moved in after France's state-owned railway company SNCF complained about the state of makeshift shacks by train tracks on their property.

Dilapidated huts built out of fragments of doors and wooden panels were destroyed, leaving litter, gas canisters and childrens' buggies on the wasteland.

Inhabitants were offered temporary housing, although none accepted, police claimed.

The evacuation passed without incident this morning, the police statement added.

Many Roma people in France live on vacant lots, lacking running water or electricity.

Dismal: The French interior minister Manuel Valls called the country's Roma camps 'slums' but sparked outrage by saying gipsy communities should leave France and return to places in eastern Europe

Abandoned: A child's buggy and other household items - including a panther ornament - in the Paris camp

Forlorn: The camp is now abandoned and its inhabitants have moved on, leaving possessions in their wake

There are an estimated 20,000 in France, a population that remains stable despite attempts by both Socialist and conservative governments to return them to their homelands.

Half that number were forced out of informal settlements in the first half of 2013, according to a report by Amnesty International, which says forced evictions should be banned.

France has launched an especially fierce crackdown on Roma camps in recent months.

The country's biggest site in Lille, which numbered 800 people, was emptied completely in September.

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls has said the Roma deserve to be thrown out of France because they fail to integrate, bringing crime and mafia-style gangs with them.

He said in September: 'I approved the dismantling of these veritable slums that represent a danger both for the people of Roma origin, but also of course the people who live in working-class neighborhoods.

'We don’t have the obligation to welcome these populations; we need to say it clearly and calmly. It is not about stigmatizing a population, but facing the truth.'

There has been a 78 per cent rise in number of arrests of Romanians in Paris over past two years (file picture)

A few days after Vall’s pronouncement,
 five Eastern Europeans were captured in a £1 million jewellery raid on a
 watchmaker’s store in the French capital. Police said a Roma gipsy gang
 was behind the robbery.

Last
 month a Roma schoolgirl was arrested as an illegal immigrant while she 
was on a school trip, and her family were removed back to Kosovo - a 
move which sparked protests by students who erected barricades and 
marched through Paris.

On 
Friday it emerged police had arrested three Roma couples over an alleged
 'Fagin-style' gang in which children were trained as pickpockets and 
exported to a vast network of countries including Britain.
