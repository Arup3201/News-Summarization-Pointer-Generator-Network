'Bad,' 'terrifying,' 'horrific,' 'evil.'

Each of those adjectives is on a list of banned words at General Motors - one of the odder twists in the company's ongoing recall of 2.6 million small cars for defective ignition switches.

The U.S. government slapped GM with a $35 million fine Friday for failing to report the deadly defect sooner. The government also released a 2008 GM training document that warns employees to not use language that could hurt the company.

Unflattering terms like 'deathtrap' and 'Hindenburg' also made the list.

The government says that the materials were part of a larger problem at GM, where engineers were reluctant to use words like 'defect.'

But safety advocates say it's common for automakers to avoid words that might legally trigger a recall.

The fine leveled on the automaker is the maximum allowed by law. But it's only a fraction of the $3.8 billion GM made last year.

The
 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating 
GM's delayed recall of older small cars with defective ignition 
switches.

GM has acknowledged knowing about the problem for at least a decade, but it didn't recall the cars until this year.

The company says at least 13 people have died in crashes linked to the problem. The Justice Department also is investigating.

Automakers are required to report safety defects within five days of discovering them.

General Motors recalled an additional 2.7 million vehicles on Thursday as a deep dive into safety issues at the nation's biggest automaker turned up more problems with some of the cars it built over the past decade.

The latest recalls bring GM's total for the year in the U.S. to more than 11 million cars and trucks, close to its annual recall record of 11.8 million vehicles, set in 2004.

The auto industry also is on track to set a single-year record for recalls. Auto companies have recalled 15.4 million vehicles in a little more than four months.

The old single-year record for recalls is 30.8 million vehicles in 2004. Toyota, Ford, and Chrysler also have announced sizeable recalls this year.

Several factors are behind the industry's recall binge. GM is reviewing all of its vehicles for safety issues following the recall earlier this year of 2.6 million older small cars with a defective ignition switch.

Jeff Boyer, the new safety chief at GM, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the company is looking at cases that were under review in its system and moving to resolve them as fast as possible.

GM, he said, has added 35 people to its recall review team.
