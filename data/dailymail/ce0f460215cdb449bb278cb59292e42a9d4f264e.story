After successfully racing the tube, James Heptonstall and Noel Carroll are back and ready to amaze us with their next stunt.

On November 3, 2014 at 10:08 am, the two men decided to #RacetheBoat - from the London Eye to Bankside Pier.

The 1.3-mile (2.2km) journey included five bridges and countless pedestrians to dodge as the athletic pair ran along the South Bank of the River Thames in London.

In order to successfully beat the river boat, the men had to run the length of the path in eight minutes and 30 seconds. 

James is a 30-year-old England touch-rugby player and Noel is a strength and conditioning coach at Arsenal Academy.
