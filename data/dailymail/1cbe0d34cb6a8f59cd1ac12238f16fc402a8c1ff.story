The brother of Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah could be deported from Britain after being released early from prison.

Ahmed Farah, 25, a younger brother of the long-distance runner, is said to be waiting to hear if he is to be sent back to his native Somalia.

He was jailed for false imprisonment for his part in a knife raid in Southall, West London in 2010.

But it is now thought that after being freed early from a four-and-a-half year prison sentence, the Home Office want to remove him from the country.

According to the Sun, the case to deport him began in Scotland in April but collapsed due to a delay between hearings.

Omar Farah, another brother of the Olympic athlete, who was jailed last week 

He is now being held at the Dungavel detention centre in Lanarkshire, while awaiting a date for a new immigration tribunal.

The Home Office refused to comment on the case.  

It is understood Farah moved to Britain from Somalia with this 31-year-old brother, but never became a British citizen. 

It is thought the pair no longer keep in touch.

The runner's agent refused to comment on the case.  

The case comes just a week after the athlete's other brother, Omar, was jailed after trying to break into an elderly couple's home.

The 21-year-old of Brentford, who has 15 previous convictions, was caught trying to break into the pensioners' home after visiting his girlfriend in west London.

He pleaded guilty to one count of attempted burglary with intent to steal at Kingston Crown Court last week.

He had previously spoken about the support Mo, 31, had given him, seeing him as a role model, while in a 2013 interview he said he had been training as a graphic designer in a bid to avoid getting into trouble.

But a judge branded his criminal record 'unimpressive', although the court heard he had not committed any further crimes since he tried breaking into the pensioner's home at on March 2 last year.
