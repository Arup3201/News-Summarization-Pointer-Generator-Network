Bethany Freeman, 17, went to bed at about 11.30pm at in Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, during the St Jude storms, on October 28

A mother tried to tickle her daughter's feet for signs of life after a 30ft fir tree toppled on to the caravan she was sleeping in and crushed her to death.

Bethany Freeman, 17, went to bed at about 11.30pm at in Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, during the St Jude storms, on October 28.

She was living in the caravan in the grounds of her mother’s house while it underwent major building works.

But during freak weather the tree fell down at 7am, smashing her caravan to pieces.

An inquest, in Tunbridge Wells, heard that Bethany died from brain injuries caused by the huge weight of the tree.

Bethany’s
 mother Tess Peirce and brother Guthrie Freeman, were staying in the 
other static caravan on the property, the inquest was told.

The night before she died Bethany had gone with her brother to watch an American football match at Wembley Stadium.

Their
 mother picked them up from the station and returned home. Bethany went 
straight to bed in her caravan while Guthrie and Tess stayed in their 
second static home.

In the 
morning they were woken by a huge crash, and rushed out to find her 
caravan was covered by a huge tree, which crushed the sleeping portion 
covering her bedroom, the inquest heard.

Detective
 Sergeant Sara Niblock told an inquest: 'The tree had crushed half of 
the caravan completely where Bethany was sleeping.

'They
 could see her foot sticking out from beneath the wreckage. Her mother 
tickled her foot because she knew she was very ticklish, but Bethany did
 not react.'

A tractor owned by a nearby farmer was called on and, with its forks fitted, helped lift some of the tree to allow New Zealand-born Bethany to be released on to a stretcher by emergency crews, she added.

Pc Andrew Baldry told the inquest in a statement that Bethany’s photographic identity card from her school was found amid the wreckage.

Ms Niblock said that other than a small laceration on the right of her torso, Bethany appeared from the outside to be otherwise 'unmarked'.

CPR was attempted but Bethany, an upper sixth form student at Tunbridge Wells Girls’ Grammar School, was declared dead just after 8.30am.

A post-mortem examination found she died from 'hypoxic brain injury as a consequence of a crush injury to her chest', said Mr Roger Hatch.

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Mr Hatch said: 'It was well known that on October 28 of last year, this country was subject to extremely high winds which adversely affected the tree in a neighbouring garden which was brought down and unfortunately and tragically landed on the caravan occupied by Bethany.'

Bethany was among four people killed around that time as the St Jude storm battered England and Wales, leaving a trail of destruction.

Winds of up to 100mph swept through parts of Britain, uprooting trees, knocking out power supplies and crippling transport networks.

Ms Peirce left court without commenting.

She said at the time of her daughter’s death: 'We are all absolutely devastated at the loss of my daughter. I would like to thank the emergency services for their tremendous efforts in attempting to save her.'

Bethany was a 'universally respected' pupil at Tunbridge Wells Girls’ Grammar School who 'had everything to look forward to', the school’s website said.

A sports enthusiast, she represented the county and local clubs in hockey, cricket and netball, and she was said to be a 'dedicated and truly outstanding sportswoman'.

Mr Hatch said: 'It was well known on the 28th October last year this country was subject to very large winds, named storm St Jude.

'This adversely affected the tree in the neighbouring garden which was brought down and unfortunately and tragically landed upon the caravan which was occupied by Bethany.

'I am advised to record a conclusion of misadventure. I express my sympathies to the family.'
