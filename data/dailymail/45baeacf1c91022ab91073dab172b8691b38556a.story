U.S. real estate investor Blackstone Group said Monday that it is buying the iconic 110-story Willis Tower in Chicago, the second-tallest building in the United States.

Blackstone gave no price for the purchase from the current owners, 233 South Wacker LLC, but various U.S. media reports put the deal at $1.3billion.

Known for most of its existence as the Sears Tower, the 1,451ft building was the tallest building in the world for a quarter-century after its completion in 1973.

 Blackstone Group announced on Monday that it is buying Chicago's Sears Tower (center), reportedly for $1.3billion

The building's Skydeck on the 103rd floor is a tourist attraction that allows people to look out into Chicago from all directions

Today it ranks tenth, according to The Skyscraper Center. The title of the tallest building in the United States went to One World Trade Center in New York, completed two years ago.

 The glass cubes on the Skydeck extend out over the building. More than 1.5million people visit the tourist attraction each year

The Willis Tower's Skydeck, located on the 103rd floor, is a popular tourist attraction. It provides 1.6 million visitors a year with views of Chicago and the surrounding area including from the 'Ledge,' glass cubes which extend from the building.

Jacob Werner, a managing director in Blackstone's real estate group, said in a statement on Monday that Blackstone sees 'great potential in further improving both the building's retail operations and the tourist experience for one of the most popular destinations for visitors to Chicago'.

'We are delighted to be acquiring this iconic building on behalf of our limited partners,' Werner added. 'We are bullish on Chicago as companies expand within and move into the city and look for first-class office space.'

Construction efforts for the tower started in 1970 and it was completed in 1973, according to the tower's website. The Skydeck officially opened to the public in 1974 and underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 2000.

The tower was officially renamed the Willis Tower in 2009 after Willis North America, an insurance brokerage that is a tenant in the tower, bought the naming rights. 

The purchase adds 3.8million square feet of space  to New York-based Blackstone's huge investment portfolio of real estate and related businesses around the world, including Hilton Worldwide, Invitation Homes, and Chinese shopping malls owner SCP.

Blackstone says in all it has $81billion in investor capital under management.
