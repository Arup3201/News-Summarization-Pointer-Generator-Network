U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg's journey from a childhood so poor his family couldn't afford his bar mitzvah to his life as a multimillionaire businessman who served for decades in the Senate was remembered Wednesday at a funeral in New York City packed with dignitaries.

'He came out fighting, and he never stopped,' Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove told mourners, including Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, several former governors and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

'... Frank would always be a man of the people and for the people, never forgetting his humble start,' Cosgrove said. He began the service with a Hebrew blessing while Lautenberg's wife and children stood near the senator's flag-draped casket.

Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey died at the age of 89 of viral pneumonia

Lautenberg, a liberal Democrat from 
New Jersey, died Monday after suffering complications from viral 
pneumonia. At 89, he was the oldest member of the Senate and the last of
115 World War II veterans to serve there.

Reflecting on such signature 
Lautenberg accomplishments as the laws that banned smoking on most U.S. 
flights and made 21 the drinking age in all 50 states, Cosgrove said it 
seems difficult now to imagine 'that those matters which were 
undoubtedly fierce debates of their time, and for which Senator 
Lautenberg withstood withering criticism, now, in retrospect, appear as 
inevitable and obvious as they seem necessary.'

U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez of New 
Jersey and members of Lautenberg's family gave eulogies at the service, 
the program for which featured a Lautenberg quote inscribed on a plaque 
on the exterior of the Frank R. Lautenberg Post Office and Courthouse in
Newark, N.J.: 'The true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of 
justice.'

Biden and Clinton were also set to 
speak. Dozens of dignitaries were designated as honorary pallbearers, 
including 17 senators — mostly Democrats, among them Senate Majority 
Leader Harry Reid, but also a few Republicans, including Sens. Richard 
Shelby of Alabama and Marco Rubio of Florida.

A color guard ceremony was also 
scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at the Frank Lautenberg Rail Station 
in Secaucus, N.J., outside New York City. In Secaucus, his casket was to
be put on an Amtrak train to Washington.

Lautenberg was an ardent defender of Amtrak and worked to secure hundreds of millions of dollars for mass transit projects.

His casket was set to arrive at the 
U.S. Capitol on Thursday and lie in repose in the Senate chamber, on the
Lincoln Catafalque, a bier that was built for the coffin of Abraham 
Lincoln.

Lautenberg, who served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II, will be buried Friday at Arlington National Cemetery.

A multimillionaire businessman, he 
was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and went on to serve nearly 30 
years there in two stints.

Lautenberg's story 'was an American 
story, but in his heart and in his lifetime, he was a man from New 
Jersey, a kid from Paterson,' Menendez said during the service.

Lautenberg won his last race in 2008 
at age 84, becoming the first New Jersey politician ever elected to five
Senate terms. He had announced earlier this year he would not seek 
another term in 2014.

Early in his political career, he was
a driving force behind the laws that banned smoking on most U.S. 
flights and made 21 the drinking age in all 50 states.

Lautenberg's eldest daughter, Ellen 
Lautenberg, said her father's life story 'shaped my path by 
demonstrating that there are always new opportunities to learn and 
grow.'
