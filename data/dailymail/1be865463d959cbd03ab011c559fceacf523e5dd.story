Divers today spent hours searching a small lake for clues in the case of a missing mother-of-three who vanished hours after discussing her broken relationship on reality TV show The People's Court.

Michelle Parker, 34, of Orlando, Florida, was last seen three months ago dropping her three-year-old twins off at her ex-fiancé Dale Smith's home, with whom she had a tumultuous relationship.

Police went to the lake behind a closed nightclub near South Orange Blossom Trail after getting a 'credible tip' that suggested there was evidence there. They spent Wednesday searching the area.

‘We have been waiting for clues and 
tips to see if we can find her,’ Ms Parker's mother Yvonne Stewart told 
the Orlando Sentinel. ‘It's a double-edged sword. But if she is here, I 
hope we find her.’

Authorities spent several hours in 
boats and the water, before they finished on Wednesday. A crime scene 
van left the area soon after the search. Police have shut off all local 
entrances to the water.

The couple had a 'violent' history 
and he was charged with domestic battery, according to reports. She 
filed a domestic violence case and restraining order against him in 
2009, reported ABC.

In her filing she said he 'smashed 
the passenger side window in my SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw 
them in the road'. She also alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is 
coming.'

'He gets pretty malicious and 
vindictive,' she said of him on The People's Court, 'and he's a mean 
person especially when he's been drinking.' But her restraining order 
request was refused.

Yvonne Stewart, Ms Parker's mother

Lack of evidence in her claims of 
hostility was cited. Police have said that he is not a suspect in her 
disappearance. But her mother said her daughter was humiliated by 
her TV appearance.

Her distraught family have revealed 
the impact of appearing on the show, which aired just 
hours before she disappeared in November - although it had been 
pre-recorded months before.

Yvonne Stewart told ABC when her 
daughter returned from filming in the summer she said: 'It was the most 
humiliating experience of my life. I don't even ever want to see it. I 
wish I had never gone.'

Dirty laundry: The People's Court Episode with Mr Smith and Ms Parker was promoted as 'Roller Coaster Romance Derails!' and included the pair airing the dirty laundry about their relationship

Ms Parker is the mother of an 
11-year-old son and two three-year-old twins she had with her Mr Smith, 
40. The episode that featured the couple aired at 2pm on November 17.

'It was the most humiliating experience of my life. I don't 
even ever want to see it. I wish I had never gone'

What Yvonne
Stewart claims Michelle Parker told her about People's Court

The couple fought it out over the 
lawsuit he filed claiming she lost her $5,000 engagement ring when she 
threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton hotel during a science fiction 
convention.

Police said Ms Parker has a 'violent'
history with Mr Smith, though he is not as a suspect. In the episode, 
Ms Parker described being grabbed by him and having to call police after
a fight.

On the show, Judge Marilyn Milian 
decried their volatile relationship, telling the couple that they need 
to move on. 'You're like drugs to each other,’ she scathed. ‘You're 
addicted to each other.'

Ms Parker's family reported her 
missing on the Thursday night in November when she didn't show up for 
work at 8pm at The Barn restaurant, where she was a bartender.

Distressed: Her mother Yvonne Stewart is calling for tips from people who may have seen her daughter

A video showed her going to a KFC 
drive-through in Casselberry, Florida, three hours before she dropped 
off her three-year-old twins at their father Mr Smith's home - the last 
place she was seen.

'We've gone through Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s. We had a goal she'd be with us, and she's not'

Gayle Parker, Ms Parker's stepmother

Police made the footage public last 
month in a desperate effort to keep her case in the public eye. They 
have received 750 tips so far, one of which led them to the tape. But it
offered no new clues.

In late November, a judge ruled that 
Mr Smith should get custody of twins that he had with Ms Parker. The 
children had been taken away from him after police said he was the prime
suspect.

Divers found her Apple iPhone, which 
last pinged a signal at 8pm on the day of her disappearance, a few weeks
later in December under a bridge in Belle Isle, south Orlando, reported
MSNBC.

'We've gone through Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, New Year’s,’ Ms Parker's stepmother Gayle Parker said. ‘We 
had a goal she'd be with us, and she's not.’
