The Bank of England has come under fire for lavishing staff with pensions ‘beyond the wildest dreams’ of ordinary people. 

In a withering attack, government adviser Ros Altmann has described the benefits paid to employees at Threadneedle Street as ‘mind boggling’ and the most generous she has seen in the UK.

Last night another pensions expert said the gold plated pensions enjoyed by Bank officials are more befitting of an ‘international superstar chief executive.’

More than 1,000 Bank staff are still building up benefits in a gold plated final salary pension which pays out a retirement income based on salary at retirement and length of service.

The same applies for a slightly less generous ‘career average’ pension introduced in 2007 for new employees, which has around 1,400 ‘active members’.

But staff in either scheme do not have to contribute a penny for the privilege.

Instead the Bank makes an annual contribution of more than half of their salary.

Even MPs - who also enjoy hugely generous final salary pensions - typically contribute just under 14pc of their salary.

Latest figures published by the Bank show it also increased contributions from under £50million last year to almost £75million this year to plug a growing funding deficit in its pensions.

Dr Altmann, who has been appointed by the Government to champion the rights of older workers, said: ‘These benefits are beyond the wildest dreams of ordinary savers.

‘It means staff on £50,000 are actually being paid £75,000 – they don’t have to contribute a penny.

‘I can’t think of any other schemes in the UK which are as generous as this.’

The vast majority of private sector employers have shut down their final salary pension schemes because they are too expensive to run - partly because people are living longer.

Just 1.8million private sector workers are still paying into a final salary pension scheme – a drop of around half since 2006, according to the latest figures from the Pension Protection Fund.

Oil giant Shell in 2012 became the last blue chip company in the UK to shut its final salary pension to new joiners.

Almost a third of final salary schemes in the private sector have been closed to future contributions for existing members.

Meanwhile the gulf between public sector and private sector workers is growing, with around 12 million public sector workers still enjoying a generous final salary pension funded by taxpayers.

Millions of private sector workers are being automatically enrolled into work pensions as part of a government-backed scheme to kick-start saving in the UK and avert a future crisis.

Referring to the Bank of England’s pension arrangements, Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Landsown, said: ‘These benefits are off the scale and are more generous than the best mainstream public sector schemes.

‘You are getting into international superstar chief executive territory here.’

Although the Bank of England’s pension is not funded by taxpayers, this is not the first time its generous benefits have come under the spotlight.

Earlier this year it emerged Mark Carney had become the first £1million governor, with his move from Canada to London costing the Bank of England nearly £200,000, on top of his £874,000 annual package.

This includes a £250,000 annual housing allowance. Mr Carney is not a member of the Bank’s final salary pension scheme and receives a payment of around £145,000 - 30pc of his £480,000 salary - instead.

The Bank of England declined to comment.
