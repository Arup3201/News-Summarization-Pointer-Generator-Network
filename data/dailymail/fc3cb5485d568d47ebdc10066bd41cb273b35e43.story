Beaming broadly in jumpers emblazoned with snowmen, reindeers and even a penguin, these images are proof that even the A-list aren't immune to the charms of of a thoroughly naff Christmas knit.

This group of kind-hearted celebrities, including Myleene Klass and Julie Walters, have volunteered to show theirs off in public, all in the name of promoting Save The Children's Christmas Jumper Day.

The fundraiser, which takes place on the 13th December, aims to raise money to help support vulnerable and poverty-stricken children around the world.

Among the comedy knits featured in the campaign is the cheerful crimson effort emblazoned with a smiling snowman worn by Lorraine Kelly, and Julie Walter's star spotted elf inspired jumper.

Presenter Myleene Klass manages to pull off the trick of looking glamorous while sporting a blue Christmas knit and an elf hat, while The Saturday's Rochelle Humes is cool in her penguin printed number.

Other celebrities to feature include comedian Dom Joly who appears cheerful in a green knit with Rudolph pictured on the front, and Gok Wan, who appears in a red jumper with a Christmas pudding on it and his pet dog in his arms.

Next month's event is the second time Save the Children have held a Christmas Jumper Day and the charity hopes 2013 will build on the success of last year's fundraiser.

The first Christmas Jumper Day saw more than 275,000 people sign up for the event and donate £1 or more to the cause.

Last
 year's tagline, 'Make The World Better With A Sweater' will also return
 and brands such as John Lewis are working with the charity to help 
boost the amount raised.

A Save the Children spokesman said: 'We’re lucky to have a host of celebrity supporters behind the campaign who have dug out their festive knits to drive awareness and to get people donating.

'As well as posing in their Christmas jumpers, many of our celebrities will be helping out in other ways: Myleene Klass will be launching Woolly Wonderland - a pop up at Westfields where you can pimp your Christmas Jumper at customisation workshops -  and Arlene Philips will be leading our attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most people wearing Christmas jumpers in one room.'

Although individual donations are expected to form the bulk of the money raised, the charity has launched group fundraising packs for schools, families and offices.

If nothing else, raising money as a group will mean that you won't be the only person sporting a novelty knit on December 13th.
