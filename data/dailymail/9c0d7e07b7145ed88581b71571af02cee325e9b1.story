The government’s emergency committee was convened today to discuss the devastating disease which is threatening Britain’s ash trees.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson chaired a meeting of Cobra with officials from Number 10, government agencies and scientists to consider how to stem the spread of the killer fungus ash dieback.

Ministers have been warned the disease is untreatable, with an estimated 100,000 trees already destroyed after being found to be infected.

The Cobra committee will discuss how to respond to the ash crisis, which could see 80million trees destroyed

The Government's chief scientific adviser briefed the hour-long Whitehall meeting, which included officials from the Forestry Commission and the devolved administrations.

Mr Paterson said: 'We have had an assessment of the state of the disease.

'We also had an assessment of the current survey, where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the United Kingdom.

This was a meeting that brought in the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing that, right across the UK, we are determined to work together.

'We also had a presentation on possible solutions - at the moment we do not have a cure for the disease - and also measures we might take having established the survey, which should be completed by the middle of next week.'

On Monday Mr Paterson imposed a ban on the import of ash trees amid predictions the ‘devastating disease’ could wipe out 80million British trees.

Scientists have warned tackling the crisis would 'change the countryside significantly.'

However, Mr Paterson has been accused by a Tory MP of dither and delay in taking action.Zac Goldsmith said the Mail that ministers should have acted eight months ago when reports first came through that the ash dieback disease had entered the country.

He has put down a parliamentary motion demanding that ministers plough money into research into plant health and a new rapid reaction force to deal with disease threats.

Mr Goldsmith, the environmentalist MP
 for Richmond in south west London, said: 'The government is finally 
doing the right thing, but it took far, far too long, and for ash at 
least, it may be too late. We should have sprung into action when the 
fungus was found over eight months ago.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has been accused by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith of not acting fast enough to tackle the crisis

'We have already seen that the longer these problems are ignored, the greater the cost of dealing with them, which is why we need more resources to be allocated now to prevention and rapid reaction.

'Among other things, that means better screening and control at our borders by government, and more use by the horticultural and landscaping industry of our domestic nurseries.

'We need a different approach; one that puts biosecurity ahead of promiscuous trade.' 

Mr Paterson will be challenged about his handling of the crisis when he is grilled by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee on Tuesday.

Committee chairman Anne McIntosh, a Tory MP, said there are 'many questions to be answered'.

'The government needs to me more alert to plant health. I want to know when the department first knew about this. The Horticultural Trades Association say they first wrote to Defra about the disease in 2009 - I will be asking him about that.

'Successive governments have been underfunding plant health. The department is now increasing the funding available, but why did they not do this before?'

She added: 'I want to know why we are importing ash saplings. Why do we rely so heavily on imports for so many popular trees?

'Are saplings more prone to this disease? How will it impact on mature trees, and have we become more prone because of the extreme wet weather we have been having?

'And I will be asking whether there are any other potential diseases threatening popular trees.'
