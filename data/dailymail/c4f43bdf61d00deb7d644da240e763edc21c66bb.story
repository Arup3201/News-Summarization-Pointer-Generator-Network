Police in Brazil have smashed a high-end prostitution ring that delivered well-known Brazilian models and cover girls to businessmen and politicians in Europe and Africa, it was reported today.

The women, who according to police appeared regularly on Brazilian TV and in men's magazines, are believed to have been paid as much as £60,000 a week, investigators said.

Police claim the gang transported as many as 90 women a year from Brazil to wealthy clients in Angola, South Africa, Portugal and Austria in a racket believed to have amassed them over £28 million since 2007.

Federal police officers moved in on the gang yesterday following a year-long investigation, arresting three men and two women in the state of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil.

The two female suspects are alleged to have approached and recruited the women.

Eleven luxury cars, as well as 23 passports, 14 visa requests for travel to Angola, foreign money and drugs were also seized, police said.

Police chief Luiz Tempestini, who led the investigation, told Brazil's O Globo newspaper that many of the women, who have not been named, worked as dancers, models or actresses on popular Brazilian TV shows.

Mr Tempestini said once abroad the women were told they needed to have relations with the men without protection in order to earn the large amount they had been promised. Some of the women were held against their will, he added.

Once back in Brazil victims were allegedly offered a cocktail of anti-Aids drugs, which were in fact fake placebo pills.

He added that two groups of four to five women were sent abroad every month, for a week to ten days at a time, with Angola being the most frequent destination.

He said: 'The first group was made of women who were recruited from a high-class prostitution house in a wealthy area of Sao Paulo, who earned around $10,000 (£6,000) per week.

'The second group was formed of models featured on the covers of men's magazines or who worked on TV programmes. They would make as much as $100,000 (£60,000) for the same period.'

Mr Tempestini said that among the group's clients was a well-known Angolan businessman and a former Angolan politician.

The gang members who were arrested have been charged with participation in organised crime, international people trafficking, embezzlement, false imprisonment and endangering the health and life of others, and face a maximum jail term of 30 years.

Two other suspects wanted by Brazilian police and believed to be living outside the country were placed on Interpol's red notice list.
