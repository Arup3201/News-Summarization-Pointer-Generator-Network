Jeremy Clarkson could make a return to the BBC as early as next month to front the Top Gear Live world tour, which is set to make more than £10million.

BBC bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour, which was planned to be fronted by Jeremy Clarkson along with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond under the BBC Top Gear brand.

However the future of the shows, which have sold 200,000 tickets, has been cast into doubt after Clarkson was dismissed from the BBC last week for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer.

Jeremy Clarkson (right) was due to front the Top Gear Live tour from next month, but talks are now underway about how the shows can go ahead and if BBC branding will be removed after he was dismissed 

It is understood  if the corporation tries to block the world tour, which starts in Australia next month, from going ahead they could be liable for refunding tickets at a total cost of around £10million. Fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets to the live shows.

One option could be to allow the events, which will also take place in London and South Africa, to go ahead under a different name and without some of the key elements of the lucrative BBC show - such as the Stig. 

A message on the Top Gear Live tour website thanks fans for their 'continued patience'. 

It says: 'We have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of Jeremy's contract not being renewed by the BBC.' 

Live Nation, which has been promoting the tour, said it would go ahead in some form but they may have to rebrand. 

Phil Bowdery said: 'The BBC owns the name and certain aspects of the show. We won;t be able to use any VT of Top Gear.

Clarkson, 54, was dismissed from the BBC last month for an unprovoked attack on a Top Gear producer

'There will be a new name and no Stig because obviously that's their property. We've sold an awful lot of tickets and we want to keep faith with people who bought the tickets.' 

Sources have claimed there is a small chance the show could go ahead unchanged, but most believe it will have to be significantly changed. 

It could be renamed Clarkson, May and Hammond Live or MPH Live, the Sunday Mirror reported. 

Clarkson is already set to return to the BBC on April 24 when he appears as a host on Have I Got News for You. 

Hat Trick Productions, which makes the show, said there is no reason to believe the show will not go ahead as planned. 

If the live shows go ahead key elements may have to be removed - such as the mysterious Stig 

Tony Hall, the Director-General of the BBC, has had to employ round-the-clock bodyguards after he received a death threat for refusing to reinstate Clarkson. 

He became a target after taking the final decision to axe Clarkson, the BBC's biggest star, from his £1 million-a-year role presenting the Corporation's biggest global money-spinner.

Clarkson's contract was not renewed after an internal investigation found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second physical assault, following a prolonged verbal tirade in a row over a hot meal. 

The 54-year-old's fellow presenters, Richard Hammond and James May, are said to be considering offers by the BBC to star in the corporation's planned version of Top Gear, scheduled for 2016. 

A spokesman from BBC Worldwide said: 'There’s lots of speculation about Top Gear at the moment – however no Top Gear Live shows have been cancelled and we are working through the implications of Jeremy’s contract not being renewed. We will update ticket holders as soon as possible.'
