A teaching assistant has been handed a staggering £800,000 in compensation after she tripped and dislocated a finger at work.

The payout – one of the highest ever awarded in education  – was made after Julie Anne Huddart tripped over the waist strap of an empty wheelchair while trying to move it.

Mrs Huddart, 49, dislocated a finger and injured her elbow in the 2003 accident, and has since been diagnosed with ‘reflex sympathetic dystrophy’ – a malfunction of the nervous system that causes pain and swelling. Mrs Huddart's lawyer explained that she had been left in constant pain with severely restricted movement down the left side of her body.  She is now dependent on the care of her husband.

Astronomical: Lancashire County Council had to pay out £1.3 million in school compensation claims in just one year

The married teaching assistant, from 
Chorley, Lancashire, began a nine-year battle against her local 
authority for compensation, and earlier this year Lancashire County 
Council agreed to pay £800,000 in damages and £140,000 in legal costs in
an out-of-court settlement.

The award, which sparked fury among 
war veterans and victims of crime who received substantially less for 
their injuries, is part of a burgeoning compensation culture among 
teachers who last year claimed a record £25million following accidents 
and employment disputes.

Recent payouts include £200,000 for slipping on a grape and £173,595 for dislocating an ankle during playground duty.

A teacher who preferred to take small
classes was handed £250,000 after being put in front of a full class, 
including disruptive pupils, which caused a recurrence of a nervous 
breakdown.

Unbelievable: Jessica Knight, pictured, was initially awarded just £18,895 after being left for dead in a frenzied knife attack. Her mother Jill Walmsley said the teaching assistant's award was 'astronomical'

Yet classroom unions which helped 
secure the payouts have been vocal in their attacks on spiralling 
compensation claims from parents who resort to lawyers when their 
children fall in the playground or have accidents on school trips.

Lancashire council leader Geoff Driver said yesterday the award was a ‘sad reflection on the litigious society we have become’.

Jill Walmsley, the mother of a 
teenager who was stabbed 35 times and left for dead in a frenzied 
unprovoked attack in 2010, condemned the payout.

Jessica Knight, now 16, suffered 
injuries so severe she suffered a stroke and was in a coma for weeks. 
But the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority – which can offer 
victims up to £250,000 – awarded her just £18,895. The family appealed 
and received a larger payout, but it was still ‘substantially’ less than
the award to Mrs Huddart.

Ms Walmsley, from Chorley, 
Lancashire, said: ‘Jess didn’t even get a quarter of that sum. It is 
unbelievable, astronomical. Something that can change your life for ever
gets a measly sum.’

War hero Dave Watson, who lost both 
legs and his right arm in a bomb blast in Afghanistan, added: ‘It is bad
because we are going out there and our lives can change just like that.
It is unfair – we are doing a more dangerous job.’

Mrs Huddart’s payout was one of 12 to
school staff in Lancashire alone last year, costing taxpayers more than
£1.3million. Other payments included £42,000 to a teacher who pushed a 
door which did not open, resulting in concussion and an arm injury. The 
council also had to pay £26,713 in costs.

Figures from the three main classroom
unions show they secured £25million in compensation for members last 
year. Most of the cash was paid out following employment disputes, but 
there were also significant personal injury payouts, including £158,000 
for slipping on mud during a fire drill.

Many cases never reached court but 
were settled using ‘compromise agreements’ – legal agreements to accept 
compensation rather than pursue a tribunal claim.

Employment payouts included £33,000 
to a teacher who was fired for gross misconduct amid allegations she 
falsified test results, albeit in optional tests. The school ‘failed to 
provide any evidence the member’s actions had been deliberate’.

In another case, a teacher with 
serious criminal convictions dating back 20 years – before she started 
teaching – was fired after the local council discovered the offences. A 
tribunal awarded her £35,500.

The growing payouts culture is 
thought to be partly driven by schools and local authorities settling 
out of court to minimise their losses, sometimes without properly 
investigating the claims. And the size and number of payouts have 
prompted accusations of double standards after unions criticised 
litigious parents.

In the past, the NASUWT union has 
lamented that ‘society no longer appears to accept the concept of a 
genuine accident’ and condemned the ‘rise of the blame culture’.

It is believed Mrs Huddart has been 
unable to work since the accident. She lives with husband Aled and two 
children from a previous marriage in a £200,000 semi-detached home in a 
residential estate.

Lancashire County Council said the 
cost to the authority was £100,000 – the rest was covered by its 
employer’s liability insurance.

Mr Driver added: ‘We contested this case but liability was decided by the courts.

‘It is a sad reflection on the 
litigious society we have become. There seems to be no such thing as an 
accident any more; everything is argued to be someone’s fault.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘Every penny spent on settling these claims means less 
money spent on educating children.’

The compensation details were released as part of a Freedom of Information request.
