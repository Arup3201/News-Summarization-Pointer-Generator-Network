One in five women admit to being more turned on by a pair of shoes than by their boyfriends, finds a new study, and one in six say the same of their husbands.

Additionally, half of those surveyed by ShoeBuy.com fessed up to lying about the true price of a new pair of heels.

Most women aren't too proud to own knock-offs however, with 82per cent admitting to possessing fake designer shoes.

Shh: One in five women admit to being more turned on by a pair of new shoes than by their significant other, finds a new study, and half are willing to lie about the price they really paid for them

The study, which focused on 1,000 women between the ages of 35 and 44, also revealed that the subject of shoes is a hotbed for female cattiness.

Nearly half admit to having judged someone based entirely on their shoes; and it's an even split on whether or not those judgements were positive or negative - depending, presumably, on the caliber of said shoes.

Quite what it is about fancy footwear that has such an enduring appeal among women remains something of a mystery, but its prevalence is undeniable.

New shoes you say? As Carrie Bradshaw infamously once said in Sex and the City, 'Men I may not know, but shoes, shoes I know'

In the immortal words of Sex and the City front-girl, Carrie Bradshaw: 'Men I may not know, but shoes, shoes I know.'

Marilyn Monroe echoed the sentiment when she proclaimed: 'Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world.'

And shoe designer to the stars Christian Louboutin famously delivered the verdict: 'A woman can carry a bag, but it is the shoe that carries the woman.'

In an ironic twist on the fashion staple that entices more lust in some women than their spouses, high-heeled shoes were actually first invented in the 1500s, for men on horseback to stay in their stirrups.

'A woman can carry a bag, but it is the shoe that carries the woman'

That trend evidently failed to endure for the men, but these days, the average American woman owns 17 pairs of shoes, and admits to only wearing three pairs regularly.

And in a final testament to women's utter devotion to their shoes, the recent study reveals that a quarter refuse to kick their high heels off in the interest of comfort, no matter how painful they might be.
