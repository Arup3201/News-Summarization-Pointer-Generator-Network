Former NFL star Tim Shaw used the Ice Bucket Challenge to announce that he is suffering from ALS - the disease for which the internet craze is raising millions of dollars.

The 30-year-old former Tennessee Titans linebacker - who only retired last year - posted his Ice Bucket video on the team's website and revealed that he had recently been diagnosed with ALS - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - a form of motor neurone disease.

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has seen hundreds of celebrities and public figures post videos online of themselves being doused in ice water, then nominate someone else to follow suit.

The nominee has 24 hours to comply or donate $100 to ALS research.

Most participants undergo the soaking and make a donation as well.

Among those who have taken part are former President George W Bush, pop star Britney Spears and actress Gwyneth Paltrow.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also known as Lou Gehrig's disease - is the most common form of motor neurone disease, which affects a person's ability to move voluntarily.

While the person continues to think and feel, they suffer muscle atrophy and are often unable to walk, eat or talk, leaving them effectively 'locked in' to their body.

It is estimated that about half of those diagnosed with motor neurone disease will die within the first 14 months of knowing they have it.

There is no known cure at present.

The campaign has gone viral on the internet and is estimated to have raised more than $31million, according to the ALS Association - including $8.6million on Wednesday alone.

Shaw's Ice Bucket was especially poignant, however, as he revealed in his video that he has been diagnosed with ALS himself.  

He says: 'A year ago I was playing NFL football. I've recently been diagnosed with ALS. I'm here today to stand up and fight with all of you against this disease.'

'I want to challenge the Tennessee Titans organization, Coach Franklin and the Penn State football team and my Clarenceville community,' Shaw says. 'Let's do this.'

His former Titans team-mates - including quarterback Jake Locker and running back Dexter McCluster - then performed the challenge en masse.  

Shaw is at least the fourth NFL veteran in the past seven years to be diagnosed with ALS, according to Forbes. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report that ex-NFL players were four times more likely to die from ALS than other people.

Two years ago, former New Orleans Saints safety Steve Gleason was diagnosed with the condition.

ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects two in every 100,000 people.
