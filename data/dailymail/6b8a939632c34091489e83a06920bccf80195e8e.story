Manny Pacquiao looked extremely focused during a training session in the Philippines as he stepped up his preparations for his mega-fight against rival Floyd Mayweather.

The 36-year-old was put through his paces on Monday as he worked out at a gym in General Santos City, located in the Philippines' southern island of Mindanao.

Pacquiao, who was dressed in red and blue Nike garments during the session, will fight long-term rival Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2.

He took to Twitter over the weekend to say: 'I am very happy that Floyd Mayweather and I can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years.

'I dedicate this fight to all the fans who willed this fight to happen and, as always, to bring glory to the Philippines.'

Pacquiao previously told his Twitter followers that he 'can easily beat Mayweather', which was retweeted 100,000 times on the social media website.

Mayweather, on the other hand, uploaded a picture of the signed contract for the fight on to his Shots social media account.
