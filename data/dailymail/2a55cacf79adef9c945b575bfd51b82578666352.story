A Michigan hockey player and obvious Super Troopers fan did the 2001 cult favorite proud during a mid-game interview this week.

Ray Kaunisto, of the Kalamazoo Wings, gave an on-ice interview during his team's match against the Fort Wayne Komets on November 28, managing to sneak in seven 'meows' during the 40-second chat.

The goal was 10, as per an infamous Super Troopers scene where an officer bets another he can't say 'meow' 10 times during a traffic stop, in what the pair call 'The Cat Game'.

'I thought about doing it a little bit before and then I just figured just let it rip and see what happens,' Kaunisto told MLive.

'I almost chickened out. I almost didn't do it, but I kind of just went with it.'

And lucky he did.

Not only has the interview gone viral, Kaunisto said his little game actually helped him on the ice.

'To be honest, I wasn't playing that well right before the interview happened,' Kaunisto said.

'I think that really helped me out and kept me composed. Any other time I probably would've started laughing.'

In the video the interview appears oblivious what Kaunisto is doing.

'Right meow we came out, hit a few guys quickly there,' he said.

'We got to get into the corners meow, and maybe pass the puck a couple more times down in the neutral zone there meow.

'Right meow our focus is on banking as many points meow, but right meow, we're doing a pretty good job coming out and getting the first goal.

'Thanks meow.'
