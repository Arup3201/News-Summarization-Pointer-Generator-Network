Having whiter teeth makes people think you earn £10,000 more than if you have stained teeth

A bright white smile could be the key factor in getting a new job or even a first date.

Having whiter teeth makes you look more successful, more employable, more attractive and even five years younger, according to a new study.  

Most Brits want their teeth to be two 
shades whiter, with three out of four dentists saying that yellow teeth is still
 the biggest problem with the nation's smiles

Dentists
 claim 75 per cent of Brits are now asking for whitening 
treatments, and many are actively requesting celebrity white smiles, such as 
that of Holly Willoughby.

The study investigated the attitudes of 
over 2000 British men and women on white teeth, as well as leading 
professional dentists.

Almost a third of men think white teeth 
demonstrate wealth and status, and it also doubles the perception you 
have been privately educated or gone to university.

Additionally, it seems brushing your teeth properly could have as much impact in the battle against ageing as anti-wrinkle serums and creams.

The study, conducted by Oral B, also 
revealed having white teeth can make you look five years younger... and 
increases your attractiveness by 20 per cent.

On a date, bad breath and yellow teeth 
are top turn-offs, beating spots and bad hair, and men are more worried 
about having bad teeth than going bald.

Dr Uchenna, Oral-B 'smile director', 
said: 'The research proves that the UK is finally catching up with the 
US - with most Brits, not just our celebrities, now investing in a white
 smile as a key lifestyle asset.

'Whether looking for a job or searching for new love, a white smile is now a real investment on many levels.'

'Interestingly,
 while the nation's teeth are much better than they were a generation 
ago, we're still a nation of lazy, bad brushers, with only 25 per cent 
of Brits cleaning their teeth properly. 

'I
 would like to see Brits focusing not just on the instant beautification
 of white teeth but ensuring they brush correctly for ongoing good oral 
care.'
