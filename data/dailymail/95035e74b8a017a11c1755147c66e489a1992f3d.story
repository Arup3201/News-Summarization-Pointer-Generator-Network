Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney phoned his British counterpart last night to complain about claims that horsemeat DNA tests by the Irish authorities were based on 'local intelligence'

Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney phoned his British counterpart last night to complain about claims that horsemeat DNA tests by the Irish authorities were based on ‘local intelligence’. 

Officials in Mr Coveney’s department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland both repeated their denials in recent weeks of any ‘tip-off’ that led to the new tests, which have sparked an international scandal.

The British Secretary of State for the Environment Owen Paterson said in the House of Commons that the FSAI was acting on ‘local intelligence’ – claiming Mr Coveney had personally confirmed this to him.

The department and the FSAI have maintained since the scandal broke that horse DNA was discovered during routine testing and not because of a tip from a whistleblower.

Speaking on Monday in the House of Commons, Mr Paterson said: ‘The reason the Irish agency picked up this issue in the Irish plant was that it had local intelligence that there was a problem. That is why it did a random check, I cleared that with Minister Coveney today.’

In response to inquiries about Mr Paterson’s allegations, a spokeswoman for Mr Coveney first said she could not comment, and then revealed that the minister had called Mr Paterson last night to reach agreement that this was ‘not the position’.

She added that she had ‘no idea’ where the term ‘local intelligence’ originated.

The row comes as increasing numbers of Irish firms are linked with the scandal. 

Lancashire County Council in Britain removed prepared cottage pies from 47 school kitchens after traces of horse DNA were found in the meals. These had been provided by Oak Farm Foods, a division of Dawn Fresh Foods. 

The Queally family, including brothers John and Peter, controls the company, as well as Dawn Meats, the firm that provides one in every five burgers sold in Europe by McDonald’s. 

The Queally brothers are also directors of QK Meats Naas Ltd and QK Cold Stores. 

QK Cold Stores has recently reported to authorities that tests on imported meat products tested positive for horse DNA. 

On Thursday, UK supermarket chain Asda withdrew bolognese sauces supplied by Irish company Greencore following tests that revealed the presence of horsemeat.

The CEO of Greencore is Patrick Coveney, the Agriculture Minister’s brother.  

The horsemeat scandal has swept across Europe and criminal investigations are being carried out in at least three countries.

In Britain, three men were arrested last week on suspicion of fraud as authorities investigated the possible mislabelling of meat.

One of the men, 63-year-old Peter Boddy, owns an abattoir in West Yorkshire now under investigation. He also had a contract with Aintree Racecourse for destroying the carcasses of injured horses.

Mr Boddy and the other men were released on bail yesterday pending further police inquiries.The saga began last month with the discovery of horsemeat in beef burgers from a division of Larry Goodman’s processing empire in Co. Monaghan.  

Mr Coveney has insisted Irish horses cannot enter the food chain, saying there is strong traceability in the system. 

However, when an Irish Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that official records for Charlie, an abandoned horse rescued in Longford, incorrectly showed he had been slaughtered, the minister was forced to admit problems do exist and the extent of confusion with the passport system is growing. 

‘Where tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain. My department has received a small number of complaints in this area,’ Mr Coveney said.

According to the minister, 24,000 horses were slaughtered in Ireland last year.

Almost half of these were slaughtered in abattoirs run by local authorities.  

A spokesman for the department said it is now considering taking these under its own control, but he did not reveal why.   

There is no central registration for counting horses in Ireland. 

The spokesman added: ‘The department is developing a central database of horses.’

Some of Ireland’s top racehorses may have passed through the hands of the slaughterhouse owner arrested in Britain this week – including five that died during the Aintree Grand National.

While there has been speculation about thoroughbred racehorses being slaughtered for the meat industry, this is the first time a direct link has been established. 

Aintree Racecourse confirmed to the MoS that Peter Boddy, one of three people arrested by police on Tuesday on suspicion of fraud, was the sole contractor to remove injured and dying horses from the legendary steeplechase at Aintree, where five Irish horses died in recent years. 

Among them were Irish Grand National winner Hear The Echo, owned by Michael O’Leary’s wife, Anita; and Dooney’s Gate, owned by legendary trainer Willie Mullins.

An Aintree spokesman declined definitively to confirm that the Irish horses had been disposed of by Mr Boddy, saying that some may have gone to Leahurst Veterinary Hospital for postmortems.But an Irish expert explained that horses taken to the hospital would then be sent on to the slaughterhouse anyway.

Professor Des Leadon of the Irish Equine Centre said: ‘The vet makes the final decision when a horse is dying. Insurers may ask for a postmortem.

They are carried out at the Equine Centre. Then they go to Category 2 plants known as knackeries. We document the number of horses that enter the plants.’

Prof Leadon explained that because racehorses often had to be given medicine, they were not supposed to enter the food chain.

The British Food Standards Authority said: ‘Three individuals were arrested by Dyfed-Powys Police on suspicion of fraud, as a result of the agency’s investigation into the use of horse meat in the food chain.’

The other two men arrested are linked to Farmbox Meats in Wales. All three were released yesterday. 

Aintree Racecourse confirmed Mr Boddy was employed to remove injured horses when necessary, including horses that died during or shortly after a race at the course. The Grand National is the best-known race at the Liverpool venue. 

A spokesman said Mr Boddy had worked with the racecourse for the past six to seven years. During this time, eight racehorses died during or shortly after the race.

Five of these were bred in Ireland and three were either owned by Irish people or trained in Ireland. 

One Grand National casualty, Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised, owned by JP McManus, was buried but in most cases, the owners of horses that die during a race left the animal’s disposal to the racetrack. 

The disposal of Mr O’Leary’s horse Hear The Echo was left to Aintree. 

Asked about the horse, a spokesman for Mr O’Leary’s Gigginstown stud said: ‘He died on the racecourse of a heart attack.’ 

Asked what had been done with the horse’s carcass, he said: ‘The racecourse took care of that.’    Mr Boddy was taken from his slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, for questioning about the supply and use of horsemeat in products purporting to be beef for burgers and kebabs.

A spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys Police said yesterday: ‘We can confirm that three men arrested on suspicion of offences under the fraud act have been released on bail pending further inquiries. They will return to answer bail in Aberystwyth at a later date.’
