Maryland authorities have charged a Philadelphia man with second-degree murder in the death of a woman who was given injections to make her buttocks larger.

The Prince George’s County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 43-year-old Vinnie Taylor was charged with murder, assault and reckless endangerment after being extradited from St. Louis on Dec. 31. 

His attorney, Bethany Skopp, didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday.

On March 20, the sheriff's office says Taylor gave a woman butt injections at a hotel in Capitol Heights, Maryland, in suburban Washington, D.C.

Her death was ruled a homicide.

Detectives say they couldn't find any evidence that Taylor had any medical training.

CBS Baltimore reports that Taylor injected both cheeks with a clear, viscous fluid which resulted in respiratory failure.

'[Plastic surgeons] do it in a controlled setting; they do it with an anesthesiologist; they do it in a sterile environment. I would have serious reservations about how sterile the motel was where these injections were given,' malpractice attorney David Ellin told reporters.
