Steve Jobs’s stunning resignation as Apple CEO has prompted a huge outpouring of support and sympathy for the man who ended a 14-year reign at the technology giant he co-founded in a garage.

Mr Jobs had overseen a 9,000-percent share gain since 1997. The price dropped seven per cent in overnight trading before recovering slightly this morning, although it was still down.

The 56-year-old was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and has been on medical leave from the firm based in California since January, with health being the main reason for his resignation.

Industry analysts have today been lining up to pay tribute to the iconic face of Apple, who has turned the technology start-up into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands.

‘I think his brilliance has been 
well-documented, but what gets forgotten is the bravery with which he's 
confronted his illness,’ Sony CEO Howard Stringer said of the man worth 
$8.3billion.

‘For him to achieve this much success under these circumstances doubles his legacy.'

Google’s Eric Schmidt described his 
friend and rival as ‘one of the greatest American leaders in history' 
and someone who ‘uniquely combined an artist's touch and an engineer's 
vision’.

Fellow technology CEO Jeff Weiner, of LinkedIn, labelled him ‘the Michelangelo of the digital age’.

‘He is also the most insightful 
business speaker I've ever heard,’ Mr Weiner added. ‘He speaks the way 
he designs products - not a single wasted word.'

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said Mr Jobs needs some 'Steve time' because of the high pressure and demands of his job.

'He really has had to sacrifice a lot to run Apple,' Mr Wozniak told BYTE. 'I mean, just your time, everybody wants you day and night - that's what I mean by sacrifices.'

The general feeling across the industry is that Apple’s share price may dip short-term but the company will come back even stronger because of its unique and successful product base.

Mr Jobs has spent much time putting together a long-term strategy and looking at handing over the reins to COO Tim Cook because he has been suffering from a serious illness for some time now.

He was declared a ‘perfectionist who obsesses over every detail’ by the BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones and the Wall Street Journal’s Jennifer Valentino-DeVries said his company presents ‘an air of magic’.

'He led a company that transformed a vast array of businesses - personal computing, portable and online music, smarter mobile telephony and post-PC computing,’ said Kristie Lu Stout of CNN.

Mr Jobs said in his resignation letter: 'I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know.'

He named Mr Cook as his successor and said he looks forward to watching the company which he nourished and made into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands.

Mr Jobs will remain in position as board chairman and is simply relinquishing his seat as CEO.

Apple board member Art Levinson said: 'Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company.

'Steve has made countless contributions to Apple's success, and he has attracted and inspired Apple's immensely creative employees and world class executive team.

'In his new role as Chairman of the Board, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.'

The icon, who has been on medical leave since January, only briefly emerged in March to unveil the iPad 2 and later attended a dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for technology leaders.

Mr Jobs, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery, began to grow noticeably gaunt in 2009 and pulled out of appearances, prompting fears that he was seriously ill.

But he denied these rumours, saying it was simply a 'hormone imbalance that was robbing his body of the proteins it needs'.

Then in January 2009 he promised: 'I will be the first one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer continue to fulfil my duties as Apple's CEO.'

He received a liver transplant that same year.

Mr Jobs is soon expected to reveal more details about the transplant and his battle with cancer.

Though his resignation letter was short and to the point, it was obviously full of emotion as he thanked 'the best friends he made for life' at the billion dollar company.

He is seen as the heart and soul of Apple, with analysts and investors repeatedly expressing concern over how the company, based in Cupertino, California, would handle his departure.

BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis said: 'I will say to investors - don't panic and remain calm, it's the right thing to do. Steve will be chairman and Cook is CEO.

'But Tim has been de facto chief executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The vision and the roadmap is intact.'

Mr Cook ran Apple when Mr Jobs went on medical leave and has essentially been running day-to-day operations since early this year, with the company racking up record revenue and profit.

TIM COOK IN PROFILE

Tim Cook already has extensive experience running the company having all but taken over from Mr Jobs while he was on medical leave.

He has served as Apple's chief operating officer for seven years.

Long
 considered a front-runner to replace Mr Jobs, Mr Cook joined Apple in 1998 as
 a senior vice president of worldwide operations and was promoted to 
chief operating officer in 2004.

Before
 joining Apple, Mr Cook briefly served as an executive at Compaq and spent 
12 years at IBM, where he ran manufacturing and operations for the 
company's PC business.

He
 is credited with completely restructuring Apple's manufacturing 
operations, insisting that Apple shut down its overseas factories and 
farm out the work to third-party manufacturers.

As a result, the company
 reduced inventory and improved margins on its entire product lineup.

He
 has served as Mr Jobs's right-hand man at shareholder events and has 
completely handled earnings calls with analysts for last few years.

While
 Mr Jobs was on medical leave from January to June 2009, Apple delivered 
two back-to-back blow-out quarters, as well as an updated iPhone OS, and
 new iPhone 3GS hardware.

For
 his performance, Apple's board rewarded Mr Cook with a $5million bonus as
 well as 75,000 restricted stock units as a thank-you for 'his 
outstanding performance'.

He was previously responsible for 
Apple's worldwide sales and operations, including management of the 
supply chain, sales activities and service and support in all markets 
and countries, reported ABC.

He has been at the company since 1998 
and was recently given a $5million bonus as well as 75,000 restricted 
stock units as a thank you for his 'outstanding performance'.

To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:

I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer 
meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to 
let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.

I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board
 sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.

As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.

I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of 
it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a 
new role.

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I 
thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.
Steve

Apple became the most valuable company in the U.S. this month and is now worth $338billion.

It was confirmed in February that Jobs
 was receiving treatment for cancer after the 56-year-old's gaunt 
appearance fuelled rumours that he might resign any day.

Pancreatic cancers are generally some of the most lethal of all tumours, and the most common type often kills within six months.

Mr Jobs has battled a less common 
variety that grows far more slowly and develops in the hormone-secreting
 section of the pancreas, reported USA Today.

Although diagnosed in 2003, his illness was not disclosed until the following year, after he had undergone surgery.

The fiercely private CEO has said 
relatively little about his health problems, although he did acknowledge
 his bout with cancer during a commencement speech at Stanford 
University.

'No one wants to die,’ he said. ‘And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.'

In June, Jobs got a standing ovation 
at a software developers' conference in San Francisco to introduce an 
operating system called Lion and a wireless service called iCloud.

From the conference people tweeted that he looked 'gaunt', 'exasperated' and 'very ill'.

He stayed on stage for only three 
minutes before handing it over to Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice 
president for worldwide marketing.

He demonstrated how photos taken with an iPhone were visible on a user's iPad moments later.

The iPhone 5 is due to hit the shops 
in September with almost 40 per cent of Apple customers saying they 
would buy it even before they had set eyes on it.
