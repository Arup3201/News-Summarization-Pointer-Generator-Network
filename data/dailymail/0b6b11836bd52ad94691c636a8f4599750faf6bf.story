Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he will sign a new long-term deal this summer as he prepares to lock horns with the man who advised him to join Liverpool.

Though Rodgers has put all discussions about his future on hold to prevent distractions during Liverpool's title charge, he has revealed it is now simply a case of 'when' rather than 'if' he puts pen-to-paper.

It has long been the intentions of Liverpool's owners to reward Rodgers, who has 12 months plus the option for another year on his current contract, but the manager's first priority is stopping Jose Mourinho.

Red leader: Brendan Rodgers is ready to sign a new contract to stay at Liverpool

Selection policy: The Liverpool boss revealed that Jose Mourinho (R) advised him to choose the Reds

Rodgers and the Chelsea manager remain
 close friends but, as Liverpool home in on their date with destiny, all
 acquaintances will be shelved. Nothing is going to disturb Rodgers' 
focus in what is their biggest domestic fixture for 25 years.

'There
 is nothing really (planned) until the end of the season,' said Rodgers,
 discussing his future. 'But there is no doubt that, at some point, we 
will agree another deal. I am sure of that.'

With
 each passing week over the last 18 months, Liverpool's decision to 
recruit Rodgers has looked increasingly shrewd as they have been 
transformed from perennial underachievers to potential champions.

And
 for that Fenway Sports Group owe Mourinho a small debt of gratitude: 
Rodgers was being courted by Tottenham as well as Liverpool but, after 
an exchange of text messages, Mourinho nodded his protege in the 
direction of Anfield.

Who's the boss? Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the Premier League with three games to play

'Jose 
told me to take the job and what a great club Liverpool was,' Rodgers 
revealed. 'I had spoken to him on it, he encouraged me about the sheer 
scale of the club. I was talking to him about a choice I maybe had, he 
knows the size of this.

'It 
is a friendship (we have). It has been a continual relationship since 
2004. We have just kept in contact. I have got on with my life and work 
and that's it. He's been supportive of me wherever I have been even, in 
my time here.

'We might be considered a rival but I know that if they didn’t win the league he would want us to win it.'

But
 is their relationship strong enough to withstand rivalry? Liverpool and
 Chelsea antagonise each other and the increase in tensions stem from 
Mourinho's first spell in England, when the clubs played each other 15 
times in three years.

Helping hand: Mourinho has been supportive of Rodgers ever since the pair worked together at Chelsea

'I 
understand the history because I was on the opposite side,' said 
Rodgers. 'In that period maybe it was made to be the managers (Mourinho 
and Rafa Benitez) and that was the rivalry, but I am a different person 
and man.

'I only concentrate
 on things I can control which is the players and my club. I will always
 fight for the club however that may be. I am sure it will be a 
brilliant atmosphere because of the past but more important how we are 
doing now.'

There is little 
doubt Anfield will, as Rodgers says, be "in bloom" for this game, a 
swirling mass of scarves, flags and banners. Liverpool have not been 
this close to to the title since 1990 and the locals are trying to lift 
them over the line.

Sign of the times: Liverpool fans can feel the title returning to Anfield for the first time since 1990

Cauldron: Former Chelsea defender Glen Johnson knows the atmosphere will be intense at Anfield

It will 
be another afternoon when the noise is pumped up to mind-scrambling 
levels and Glen Johnson, who was on the Chelsea bench in 2005 during the
 fabled Champions League semi-final, has explained the influence Anfield
 can have.

'I’ve seen it 
from both sides and I remember the atmosphere that night,' said Johnson.
 'Of course I didn’t enjoy it at the time but looking back, that is what
 you play football for, to be involved in those nights.

Whether
 I was playing for Liverpool or not, I could appreciate the support. It 
definitely takes a bit out of you when you are the away team. When the 
atmosphere is that intense, it does give you that extra 10 per cent 'I’m
 pretty sure the fans will be like they were against Man City and now we
 have to follow up with the same result. If we play like we did that 
day, we can beat anyone.'
