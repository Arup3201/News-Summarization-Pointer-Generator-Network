Motorists are to have a motorway station 'tsar' to drive up poor greasy spoon standards on Britain's motorways.

Roads minister John Hayes said he is to launch an inquiry into the service offered and prices charged to motorists.

He will soon be appointing a chairman or 'tsar' to head it.

He wants to see fewer mass market chains and more independently run shops, bistros and outlets, as well as more green spaces in which to relax.

It follows moves by the Chancellor to force motorway filling stations to advertise their pump prices by the side of the road so drivers can decide whether to fill-up or drive on to the next one which may be cheaper.

Mr Hayes said: 'Service stations were once rather glamorous.

'Crowds flocked to the opening of the first service station at Watford Gap in November 1959, and to Newport Pagnell which opened the following year. But like the motorway system they served, the glamour faded quickly.

'They became more notable for bad food, congestion and fighting football fans than for providing a pleasant, friendly environment for motorists and their passengers to take a break.'

He said John Major had made an effort to improve things when he told the 1992 Conservative Party conference that service stations needed to be reformed. Many were subsequently privatised.

But much more is needed: 'I want to encourage owners and operators to go further - Providing green spaces as well as car parking spaces.'

He also wants to 'improve the quality and range of independent cafes and shops available'.

He said: 'These places should be charming and eclectic, creating a break from the particular monotony of long distance travel, not adding to it.'

'My vision for service stations is not just to offer a place where electric cars can be recharged, but also where drivers can be recharged, relaxed and ready to carry on with their journey.
