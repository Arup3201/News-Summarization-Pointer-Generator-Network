Denial: Bryan Singer has called sex abuse claims filed against him 'sick' and 'outrageous'

X-Men director Bryan Singer has called the sex abuse accusations made against him 'a sick twisted shake down' as he announces he will be missing press appearances for his upcoming movie in light of the allegations.

Singer has been named in a lawsuit by Michael Egan, a former child actor who claims he was sexually abused by the director in the 1990s as part of a Hollywood sex ring.

'The allegations against me are outrageous, vicious and completely false,' Singer said on Thursday. 'I promise when this situation is over, the facts will show this to be the sick twisted shake down it is.'

His statement explained that he did not want the claims to take attention away from the work he and the crew had carried out on 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', which will be released May 23.

'This fantastic film is a labor of love and one of the greatest experiences of my career,' he said. 'So, out of respect to all of the extraordinary contributions from the incredibly talented actors and crew involved, I've decided not to participate in the upcoming media events for the film.'

In his lawsuit, Egan claimed that he was given drugs and promises of a Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los Angeles and Hawaii.

One of his alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but this is the first time Singer has been named.

'Victim': Singer's accuser, Michael Egan, held his weeping mother at a press conference on Monday

But 
Singer's lawyer has said that credit card receipts, telephone records 
and production schedules show that he was not in Hawaii when a lawsuit 
claims he sexually abused Egan.

Singer
 was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August 
through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated 
Press.

'This
 was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not 
going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting 
and prepping it to go to Hawaii.'

Marty
 Singer - no relation to his client - said the filming records were 
available publicly but 20th Century Fox did not immediately return a 
phone call and email seeking comment.

X-Men
 was released in July 2000. Singer has directed three films in the 
blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of 
Future Past,  as well as other films including The Usual Suspects.

His
 lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about
 the claims by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts 
and doesn't know why charges were not pursued.

Named: Egan also claimed LA design firm head Gary Goddard, left, and former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, right, sexually abusing him when he was a teen model in the 1990s

Days 
after filing the suit against Singer, 31-year-old Egan filed additional 
suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, 
former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head 
Gary Goddard.

Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'.

Egan
 appeared at a news conference on Monday alongside his mother and sex 
abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.

'Hollywood
 adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said 
Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to 
really make kids careers.'

Herman said that he's already got witnesses to the crimes waiting in the wings.

One reporter asked Egan what he had to say to his alleged abusers.

Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past

'You
 won't have another chance to hurt another child,' he said as his mother
 wept beside him. 'And for the people who have been abused, please come 
forward.'

The lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several lawsuits against clergy members and others.

MailOnline does not typically name 
victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly 
about his allegations.

A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday.
