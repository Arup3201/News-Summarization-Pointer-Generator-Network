Claim: Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, today said that an Ofgem investigation into energy companies increased the risk of blackouts 

The boss of Britain's largest energy company today warned that the country could face blackouts thanks to an investigation into the Big Six suppliers.  

Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of British Gas's parent company Centrica, suggested the probe would deter investment in infrastructure and delay the construction of new power stations.  

His claim was met with a furious response from consumer groups, which accused Mr Laidlaw of 'unnecessary scaremongering' and added: 'There's no immediate prospect of the lights going out.' 

Energy Secretary Ed Davey insisted that more than a dozen new infrastructure projects were in the pipeline and blamed the Big Six for failing to invest enough in their own power supply resources.

The regulator today announced that it has asked the competition authority to launch a comprehensive probe into British Gas and its five main rivals.  

The investigation was prompted by Ofgem's findings that the energy firms have quadrupled their profits in the past four years as customers became reluctant to switch suppliers.  

Mr Laidlaw told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the inquiry, projected to take two years, would make companies and investors reluctant to commit to major infrastructure projects, putting Britain's energy supply in jeopardy.  

Asked if there was a possibility of the lights going out, he said: ‘We hope they won’t but there is an increasing risk.  

'A lot can be done in terms of demand management, but building new gas-fired power stations does take four years and that’s the time pressure that we are now up against - and we’ve just added another two years onto this. 

Profits: British Gas, owned by Centrica, has seen its profits rise over the past few years 

Bills: The cost to customers has risen from £1,095 to £1,232 over a four-year period

'The concern of this inquiry is that 
unfortunately, to do it thoroughly, is going to take two years. This 
happens at a time when we’ve already had five years of uncertainty, from
 an investment point of view, in terms of putting through electricity 
market reforms.  

'So the 
big concern is whether we’ll have a further two-year period of no 
investment at a time when Britain’s energy security is a matter of 
increasing concern.’ 

Mr Laidlaw expresses fears that the investigation would force Centrica to split its infrastructure and supply arms, suggesting that the possibility would deter the firm from investing in power generation.

'It's an inevitable consequence because the risk of investing in that space – because you might have to divest in a couple of years - has gone up,' he said.  

The energy boss told ITV News that Britain would be reliant on foreign countries for 70 per cent of its gas by 2020 thanks to the depletion of North Sea reserves.

Last month, Centrica chairman Rick Haythornthwaite warned that public opposition to the big energy firms could cause blackouts, saying: 'I think it is immensely damaging, not just for Centrica, but for the nation - I think the reputation of Britain as a place in which to invest is under threat.'

Defence: Ed Davey said Mr Laidlaw was 'absolutely, totally wrong' and predicted a robust future for energy

Sam Laidlaw, whose father was chairman of BP, is an Eton-educated oil executive who became chief executive of Centrica in 2006.  

Since starting at the firm, which owns British Gas, his pay packet has risen to nearly £5million as Centrica's profits have soared and customers have seen ever-increasing bills.  

He has been criticised for accepting a series of multi-million-pound bonuses at a time when recession-hit consumers were spending more of their income on gas and electricity.  

Mr Laidlaw owns three homes - a Chelsea town house, a Cotswolds mansion and a holiday flat on the Isle of Wight.  

Last year it emerged that he had installed a second swimming pool in the grounds of his Oxfordshire house, using more energy to heat it than the average family uses in a year.  

He is not the first Centrica official to threaten blackouts - last week, chairman Rick Haythornthwaite warned that public opposition could prompt the firm to cut back on investment in power generation.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey hit back at 
Mr Laidlaw's claim, blaming Centrica for under-investing and insisting 
that other companies were keen to build new energy infrastructure. 

'He is absolutely, totally wrong and I can prove it,' he told Today. 'We have 14 contracts for power generation over the next 15 years. What we are seeing in Britain is a big investment in energy.  

'It is true that companies like Centrica are not investing as much as we might like them to but we are seeing independent energy generation firms like Siemens coming in in their place.'  

Mr Davey added: ‘We’re seeing record levels of investment in this country, only this week, we saw 14 final bids for our 15-year contracts to build new power stations – biomass, offshore wind and so on.  

‘We’re actually seeing an investment boom. It isn’t simply from people like Centrica, it’s a lot of independent generators coming.  

'Some of the Big Six have pulled out, Sam Laidlaw’s company pulled out of the Hinkley Point Sea nuclear project but that’s going ahead with EDF. They pulled out of an offshore windfarm, Race Bank, but a Danish offshore wind company is going to build that.’

Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch, said: 'This is unnecessary scaremongering. We have over 10 per cent of gas plants mothballed, and the capacity auctions planned for later this year could help bring these back into use. 

'Also, the life of 90 per cent of our nuclear generation fleet has been extended, so, while we will need new generation, there is no immediate prospect of the lights going out.' 

Ofgem claimed that the investigation announced today would 'give people more confidence' by clarifying the regulatory environment.  

'The current market and political uncertainty is already creating concern among investors,' a spokesman said. 'The alternative of waiting to see the impact of our reforms would leave the prospect of a reference as a risk to investment for a longer period.

Chief executive Dermot Nolan added: 'This will provide clarity to make sure the lights stay on for two years, five years, 10 years, even 50 years.'
