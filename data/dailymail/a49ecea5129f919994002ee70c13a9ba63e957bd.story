Delta Air Lines is opening outdoor terraces with 'unprecedented' airport views, it was announced on Tuesday.

However for those fliers who smoke and were hoping for the chance to have one last puff in the open air lounges before boarding, expect to be disappointed as the areas will be strictly no smoking.

Sweeping runway views are being offered to Delta Sky Clubs members at New York's John F. Kennedy and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airports.

Will it take-off? The new Sky Deck terraces for Delta customers will open at JFK and Atlanta International in the summer

The terrace at JFK will be located in a $1.2 billion redevelopment of Terminal 4 set to open in May.

In Atlanta, The Sky Deck is to open this summer adjacent to the Delta Sky Club in Atlanta's new international terminal.

Spokesman Leslie Scott told MailOnline that although there will be absolutely no smoking at their new outdoor seating areas, customers will be able to enjoy a relaxing space with views of the runways and in New York, out over Jamaica Bay.

There will also be awnings for customers to sit under and plug in their laptops and smart phones. There is no bar - but free drinks from inside can be brought out to enjoy in the fresh-air.

Tim Mapes, Delta's senior vice president of marketing, said the airline is partnering with Architectural Digest and designer Thom Filicia to design the terraces.

Filicia is best known for his TV show Queer-Eye For The Straight Guy.

Mr Filicia said: 'Amid the hustle and bustle of the airport
experience, we seek to create a refuge, which represents Delta's 
dedication to elevated design and pays homage to an elegant lifestyle of
travel and the spirit of flight.'

According to American Nonsmokers Rights Foundation, as of January 2 this year, 29 of the top 35 U.S. airports are 100% smoke-free indoors.

Delta has opened or renovated 13 clubs at airports across the U.S. in the past two years. The airline serves more than 160 million customers each year, flying them to 318 destinations in 59 countries.
