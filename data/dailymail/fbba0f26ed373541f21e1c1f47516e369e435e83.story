The wicketkeeping double act of  England coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace face a real test in deciding who to pick behind the stumps for the Test series against Sri Lanka.

Keepers may be taking over the English game - the ECB’s managing director, Paul Downton, is also a former gloveman - but it is the pivotal Test wicketkeeper-batsman role that could be their biggest quandary.

England want Matt Prior to regain the all-important position he was forced to give up after the Ashes were lost in Perth, but  concerns are growing that he will not be fit in time for the first Test at Lord’s on June 12.

Expert opinion: England assistant coach Paul Farbrace, like Moores, is a former wicketkeeper

First-choice: Matt Prior is England's best keeper-batsman option but may not be fit for the first Test on June 12

Prior has not kept wicket yet this 
season because of his chronic achilles condition and has not even been 
able to play as a  specialist batsman since he scored a century in 
Sussex’s opening Championship match.

He
 has two more four-day games in which to prove his fitness and is 
adamant that he will be able to play in them - but if he does not come 
through it will be intriguing to see where England go next.

Yorkshire’s
 Jonny Bairstow is the man in possession but appears to have gone 
backwards as a keeper and batsman since his  brilliant display against 
South Africa at Lord’s two years ago and is recovering from a broken 
finger.

Jos Buttler is one 
of the most exciting talents in the game and is a key figure in 
limited-overs  formats but every time his name is mentioned in terms of 
Test cricket there seems to come a shaking of heads and mutterings of 
‘not ready’ from those in the know.

Moores,
 the former Sussex keeper, clearly believes Buttler has Test potential 
because he recruited him for Lancashire before he became England coach 
again but last week said that,  for now, he saw his charge as a one-day 
performer only.

Staking his claim: Jonny Bairstow took over from Prior in Australia but hasn't proved himself with the gloves

Talent: Jos Buttler is an exciting prospect but appears earmarked for limited overs honours only

Look beyond 
Buttler and Bairstow and England could go anywhere. The modern trend for
 a batsman who keeps could see England look at Craig Kieswetter, whose 
presence at Somerset led to Buttler heading north, while the coming man,
 but not yet, could well be Middlesex’s John Simpson.

Unlucky: Essex's James Foster is too good a player to have just seven caps as a keeper-batsman

Steve
 Davies seemed to have a golden opportunity to return to the England 
set-up this summer but his decision to give up the gloves and play as a 
batsman for Surrey would appear to scupper those hopes.

All
 of which brings us back to the man in the domestic game I consider most
 unfortunate not to have had a long career in international cricket. A 
man who has long been among the best keepers in the world and a  batsman
 good enough to score 19 first-class hundreds.

James
 Foster, at 34, is as good as ever and supremely fit. Essex feel so 
strongly about their captain that coach Paul Grayson contacted Moores 
this week to advocate Foster’s Test claims and, to me, it is little 
short of a scandal that he has earned just seven Test caps, the last way
 back in 2002.

So highly do 
Essex rate Foster that, Sportsmail understands, they would be prepared 
to sacrifice the promising batsman-keeper Ben Foakes when his contract 
expires at the end of this season should they be forced to choose 
between him and Foster.

What’s
 more, Foster could be the perfect short-term fix while  England are 
waiting for Prior and if he should excel against Sri Lanka, so much the 
better.

England should have no qualms in throwing him the gloves now.

Experience: Foster was England's T20 keeper in 2009 but hasn't played a Test since the 2002 Ashes

Perfect solution: Foster's cool head could be an ideal short-term solution while Prior got back to 100 per cent

The good

I had an opportunity during the one-day international in Aberdeen to talk to Peter Moores and was struck by his terrific enthusiasm.

He is really looking forward to the England job. I’m sure, second time around, he will be older and wiser and he came across very impressively.

I know one or two senior players didn’t like ‘the method’ when Moores was coach last time but all this bloke wants to do is improve players and teams.

Encouraging: David Lloyd (right) was impressed by Moores' enthusiasm to improve England's players

The bad

I'm sure everyone in cricket will spare a thought for Ashley Giles, who suddenly turned up in the Sky commentary box in Durham because he hasn’t got a job any more.

He is such a nice bloke and an excellent coach who has found himself on the outside looking in since losing his role as England’s one-day coach last month.

He didn’t have a bad word to say about anyone involved in his sacking, on or off air, and he wants to get back to normal with a job inside the game.

The bottom line for both these guys is one simple word - results.

Outside looking in: Ashley Giles didn't have a bad word to say about anyone with regards to his sacking

Chris Adams, seen as one of the best young coaches until his fall at Surrey, was set to quit cricket before Sri Lanka resurrected his career. Now he’s plotting England’s downfall.

Adams, who was captain of the Sussex side that won the Championship under Peter Moores, will spar with his old mentor after Sri Lanka asked him to replace coach Paul Farbrace, who will act as consultant to Moores.

Adams, sacked by Surrey last year, said: ‘I was at the point where I was considering doing something away from cricket. I had given myself a set period of time. By the time the English season started, I was thinking, “At some stage you need to look at other things”.

Head-to-head: Former Surrey coach Chris Adams is consulting for Sri Lanka against his former coach Peter Moores

Switch: Adams will give the World T20 side the insight they would have received from Farbrace, who's now with the England camp

‘And I might still do that. The one thing the last year has taught me is that, as passionate and committed as you can be to sport, perhaps there is more to life than cricket. There’s a big world out there and lots of business opportunities.’

Adams, 44, will give Sri Lanka the inside knowledge that they would have received from Farbrace. Adams said: ‘I could never have imagined a few weeks ago I’d be assisting the World Twenty20 champions on the tour of England.

‘Pete played a huge role in my career. This gives me a few weeks to see how he’s operating. We grew a very strong bond and his appointment was no surprise to me. If anyone was going to get two chances with England it was going to be Peter Moores.

‘I am confident that England have appointed the best coach in the country. It will now be down to the impact he and the players have as to whether it’s successful but the combination of Moores and Farbrace is a good one.’

We have heard all the hype and seen the promotional videos. Now we will find out if the ECB’s revamped NatWest Twenty20 Blast can compete with the Indian Premier League and Australian Big Bash when it is relaunched on Friday night.

Regular Friday and weekend fixtures will help but the suspicion remains that England have fallen way behind in the form of the sport they gave to the world because of the domestic game’s refusal to embrace the franchise system.

This season will decide whether T20 is still sufficiently attractive with 18 counties rather than, say, eight city teams.
