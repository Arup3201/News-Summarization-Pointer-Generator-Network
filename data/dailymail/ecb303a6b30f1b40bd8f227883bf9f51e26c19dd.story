Sparring with each other on their hind legs, these two wild horses squared up hoof-to-hoof.

The incredible boxing stallions pulled no punches as they tried to display their dominance over each other in the herd.

Wildlife photographer Richard Ligon captured the fierce scuffle at California's Yosemite National Park.

Fighting between stallions tends to be seen during the summer months, which is the main breeding season

Hundreds of wild horses roam the plains and during mating season each male battles it out for dominance in order to secure the best mare - after this epic fight the winner had to square off against several other competitors.

Richard, who has been observing the powerful punch-offs, took the chance to capture the fight shortly before thunderstorms swept through the valley.

Photographer Richard, 48, said: 'After discovering about the horses from a local resident during a trip last spring, I went looking for them to photograph, learn, and experience these magnificent creatures.

The storm rolling into Yosemite added to the tense atmosphere as the horses reared at each other

After the flare-up the pair gradually calmed down, content to just toss their manes around

One of the stallions was getting the cold shoulder after winning the bout but at least it cleared the air

'The battles are an amazing experience to witness. On this occasion the lighter stallion on the left seemed to win the battle, only to be challenged right away by a blonde stallion, followed by a challenge from a tan stallion.

'I have seen epic battles between stallions, where it just seems to go on and on.

'On some occasions it can be calm with the horses grazing and such, and at other times there can be chaos among the horses.'
