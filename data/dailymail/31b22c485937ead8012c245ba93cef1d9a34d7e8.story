A married couple allegedly murdered the husband's ex-girlfriend then drove her body 1,200 miles across the country where they hacked her apart and dumped her dismembered remains in a creek.

Laura Ackerson, 27, vanished from Kinston, North Carolina almost two weeks ago. She was reported missing after she failed to pick up her two young sons from her ex-boyfriend's house for a weekend visit.

The beautiful young mother had been involved in an acrimonious custody battle with Grant Hayes, the father of her two children, who it emerged had a new baby girl with his wife barely a month ago.

Miss Ackerson's head, torso and limbs 
were all found separately in the creek in what one police officer 
described as 'one of the most gruesome scenes' he'd encountered in his 
entire career.

Police have now charged Hayes and his wife, Amanda, with murder after Miss Ackerson's dismembered body was found in Oyster Creek, Texas, close to where Mrs Hayes's sister lives.

Hayes, a musician, had married Amanda Perry in March last year. They had a baby daughter, Lillian, on June 9 - just over a month before the murders.

Chief Deputy Craig Brady of the Fort 
Bend Sheriff's Office alleges Hayes murdered Miss Ackerson in North 
Carolina, and hacked her body apart using a saw and a machete.

Records show the couple bought several 
ice chests and a U-Haul trailer just days after Miss Ackerson 
disappeared, and police claim they used them to transport her body to 
Texas, a drive of more than 1,200 miles.

The couple then allegedly went out 
into the creek on a small 10-foot boat, dumping Miss Ackerson's body 
piece by piece into the water - before driving back to North Carolina to
see their newborn baby daughter.

On Sunday detectives found pieces of Miss Ackerson's torso in Oyster Creek, and the next day they retrieved her head and leg from the hot, swamp water.

Officers also recovered a machete from an outhouse near where her body was found.

Chief Deputy Brady told the Houston 
Chronicle: 'It's one of the most gruesome scenes I've seen in 
30-something years of law enforcement.'

The couple were arrested in the early
hours of yesterday morning. Today they both appeared in court briefly, 
in separate hearings.

The judge ordered them to be held without bail, and and scheduled their next hearings for August 16.

Police today positively identified the remains in the creek as belonging to Miss Ackerson. When the body was found yesterday officers said they were '99 per cent certain' it was hers.

Hayes's Facebook page is full of seemingly idyllic family photographs of him, his new wife and the boys at their upscale home in Raleigh, North Carolina.

He works as an artist and a pop acoustic musician, with the stage name Grant Haze. He even posted a song on YouTube in tribute to his baby daughter soon after she was born.

Today it emerged the couple might have been planning a new life in the Virgin Islands, where he lived with Miss Ackerson while they were dating.

Mark Gierth, one of Hayes's friends, said he had a conversation with the musician the day before Miss Ackerson went missing about his plans to move back.

July 18 - Friend and business partner reports Miss Ackerson as missing.

He told NBC17: 'He said it looks like the only way he’d get joint custody is if he lived in North Carolina.

'He can’t make any money there doing what he’s doing, so he’s going to let Laura have the kids and he was going to move back to St. Thomas.'

Miss Ackerson was last seen on July 13, when she dropped the boys off with Hayes.

She was reported missing on July 18, three days after she didn't show up to collect her sons Grant, three, and Gentle, aged one, for a weekend visit.

In an interview shortly after Miss 
Ackerson went missing, Hayes's mother Patsy told ABC News: 'They [the 
boys] get over things a lot faster and they could probably not be 
affected by things as much as adults are. 

'You know because they are small and they're very resilient so they probably figure they're just staying with dad now.'

A judge granted Hayes temporary custody of the boys in June, after an acrimonious custody battle stretching back to March 2010.

He ruled Miss Ackerson was unfit to look
after her children because at the time she was unemployed and still 
living with Hayes's parents.

She had the boys at weekends and they stayed with their father and his wife during the week.

She met him at a gas station in Wilson every Friday at 5pm to pick them up - until July 15.

According to her friend, Jo Jackson, Miss Ackerson was doing her best to get the boys back.

She started her own marketing business from home and had been taking online courses at Lenoir Community College.

She had also started going to church, and the congregation of the Grace Fellowship
Church in Kingston had been praying for her safe return every day after
she went missing.

Miss 
Jackson said: 'We know that Laura would not just not show up to pick up 
her children. That is not Laura. That is not Laura at all.'

She was due to attend a court hearing on August 15, at which she planned to ask for joint custody of the boys.

She as reported missing by her 
friend and business partner Chevon Mathes, who said she was happy and 
had been finding new clients for the company.

She said: 'She always had her little boys and she seemed like great mother.'
