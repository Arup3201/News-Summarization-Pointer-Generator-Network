Key clash: Valon Behrami (Switzerland) v Antoine Griezmann (France)

Griezmann is one of the most sought-after young players in Europe, and that is not without reason. He looks comfortable filling in for the injured Franck Ribery, and Behrami, employed in a holding midfield position in front of the Switzerland back-line, will have his hands full with the tricky attacker.

Holding it all together: Valon Behrami will sit just in front of Switzerland's defence against France

One to watch: Karim Benzema (France)

The Real Madrid striker struck twice in Les Bleus’ 3-0 with against Honduras and remains one of the favourites to win the Golden Boot. Switzerland boast a mean defence though, so chances may be hard to come by for the Frenchman.

History lesson

The teams have only met once at the tournament - a goalless draw in 2006

Did you know?

Ricardo Rodriguez had two assists in his opening World Cup match.

Best bet

France to be winning at half-time and full-time - 9/5.
