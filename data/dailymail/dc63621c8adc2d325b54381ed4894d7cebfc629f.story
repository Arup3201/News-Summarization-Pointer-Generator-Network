The EcoATM: After analysing your mobile or MP3, it gives a quote on the spot, based on what a network of hundreds of electronics-recycling companies are willing to pay for it. If you accept, it spits out cash

The EcoATM machine is a fully automated phone recycler that lets users drop off old mobiles - then pays for them in cash.

It's a cupboard-sized machine with a big touch screen and metal tray where you can place your old phone or MP3 player.

EcoATM already has some machines in California, but is rolling out across the U.S. shortly.

The first machine accepts mobile phones and MP3 players - a new version will also accept Galaxy Tab devices, iPads, Kindles and Nooks.

You put a gadget in its tray, then it identifies it using a camera, matching it up against a database of 4,000 different gadgets.

It then offers you a cable to plug in your device, and checks if it's still in working order electronically - EcoATM promises it will not steal data from the devices.

Once its analysis is complete, it gives you a quote on the spot, based on what a network of hundreds of electronics-recycling companies are willing to pay for it.

If you accept, it spits out cash.

The company, based in San Diego, says, 'The kiosk solves the emerging problem of e-waste across the globe.'

'The company utilizes patented electronic diagnostics, machine vision and artificial intelligence to assess and purchase used MP3 players and mobile phones directly from consumers.'he company believes that used electronics can be restored and utilized by consumers. In fact, around 75% of the used devices can be reused again.
