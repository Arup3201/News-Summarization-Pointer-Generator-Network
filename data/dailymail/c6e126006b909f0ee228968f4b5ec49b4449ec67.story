Being an early morning TV presenter and getting up for work at 3am means getting dressed when you're probably still half asleep.

(Maybe even - if you have a sleeping husband and three small children you don't want to wake - in the dark.)

So it's little wonder BBC Breakfast star Susanna Reid, 42, slipped up on the wardrobe front by putting on her Marks & Spencer dress the wrong way round.

Appearing alongside co-host Bill Turnbull, 57 - who had managed to put his suit on the right way round - the usually well-turned-out mother-of-three didn't notice her fashion faux pas until her three-hour appearance in front of the cameras was over yesterday morning.

And after someone pointed that her £39.50 shift dress was back-to-front, Reid took to Twitter to admit her error and ask viewers: 'Just realised my dress is on back-to-front. Why didn't you tell me?' Tunbull immediately replied with: 'And spoil the fun?'

But Reid is not the first celebrity to have fallen victim to a confusing neckline.

Actresses including Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver and Amanda Seyfriend have appeared at red carpet events with their gowns on backwards, though their agents and stylists often comment afterwards that their slip-ups were completely intentional.

Even the Duchess of Cambridge has worn the 
occasional coat belt upside down.

In January this year, American actress Sigourney Weaver attended the SAG awards in an ill-fitting Lanvin dress worn the wrong way round.

Styleite
wrote: 'The front of the dress (when worn correctly, we mean) features
a deep cross-over v-neck, with a faux waist-belt detail and an 
asymmetrical hem, and the back is a plain high neckline with no 
detailing.

'On the red carpet, it appears that Weaver wore the top part of the dress backwards, but kept the bottom half as is.'

It suggested that maybe the label's designer, Alber Elbaz, 
customized the floor-length design so Ms Weaver, 63, could wear it in a different 
way.

However the black satin number failed to impress many fashion critics.

The Gloss bluntly wrote: 'Sigourney 
Weaver’s Lanvin looked like a beautifully cut trashbag.' 

While the Red Carpet Fashion Awards added: 'Maybe she thought the plunge was too deep so she opted for a sexy back instead.she opted for a sexy back instead.'

In 2011 American X-Factor judge Demi Lovato wore a raspberry Roland Mouret dress backwards to the Latin Grammy Awards, offering photographers a plunging neckline meant, in fact, to 
be a risque backline.

2010 Amanda Seyfried turned up at the premiere for Mother And Child in an unusual number by BodyAmr worn back-to-front, with the purple satin trimmed back and zip at the front and the photo-print design at the back.

And in 2009, Angelina Jolie purposefully turned 
around her Max Azria dress for the Screen Actors Guild Awards to expose her tattooed back rather than her chest with its plunging 
neckline.

And in a less dramatic fashion faux pas, the Duchess of Cambridge wore the slimline belt of a £980 MaxMara wool coat upside down when she visited Cambridge with her husband in November.

Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the loops of the skinny bow appeared underneath the belt.

The
plastic bow belt comes included with the dry-clean only coat but is 
obviously not attached, otherwise it might have saved style icon Kate 
some blushes.
