An Australian actor has embarked on a radical diet for 60 days to highlight the shocking amount of sugar in low-fat supermarket products - and the dramatic effect they can have on your health.

Damon Gameau, perhaps best known for his role as a Scottish drug mule in the second season of Underbelly, spent two months eating so-called 'healthy' foods such as juice, cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called That Sugar Film.  

But Gameau quickly discovered that appearances can be deceiving and before long started to experience some alarming health difficulties such as fatty liver disease and mental instability.

Prior to filming Gameau had spent three years shunning all sugary products from his diet - and slowly re-introduced them as an experiment.

Australian actor Damon Gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years and the results were shocking

In a new documentary The Sugar Film he aims to highlight the risk of sugars being hidden in supposed 'healthy' foods 

'Sugar is now found in 80 per cent of the food we eat, but with the constant confusion over its effects ... I feel like I need some definitive answers', the Underbelly actor says in the opening of the trailer.

On average people are consuming a whopping 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - more than four times the recommended daily intake - but it's often hidden in places we don't expect. 

Even by cutting out soft drink, confectionery, icecream and other obvious offenders within just a few weeks Gameau had begun to exhibit signs of fatty liver disease.

'This is the first time I've seen that it can be developed in two or three weeks', one doctor says, shocked at the results. 

Gameau said he felt very unwell, was lethargic and very short-tempered on the diet

More than six million Australians suffer from fatty liver disease, but only one in 1000 of those suffer from it due to alcohol intake. 

He also felt lethargic, slow, said he had a short temper and despite 'eating the same amount of calories as I did before and I'm not feeling full'. 

But retired NASA physicist Thomas Campbell says Gameau's physical wellbeing and appearance is not the only thing that the high-sugar diet is affecting.

'Your mental function is just unstable,' he says in the trailer.

Another expert warned that it didn't matter what form the sugar comes in, it can be damaging in a high amount.

'In any sugar, brown sugar, white sugar, fruit juice concentrate from fruit juice (they all have an) equal effect on your health,' he said. 

Gadeau is most famous for his role in the second season of Underbelly, but has branched out to documentary making 

'If I keep going to these levels would I be knocking on the door of obesity?,' Gameau asks a doctor at one point in the film, to which she responds: 'Definitely, you haven't got far to go.'

The documentary has been endorsed by heavyweights such as world-famous chef Jamie Oliver who describes it as 'A definite must-see'.

Stephen Fry also makes an appearance in the film saying: 'People on this planet are growing sicker every day, and many scientists now believe that fructose has a role to play.' 

Kathleen Desmaisons warns: 'Sugar isn't evil, but life is so much better when you get rid of it.'

Doctors said Gameau was on the road to obesity after just a few weeks of the diet

Speaking to Sunrise on Wednesday morning, Gameau said 'all the sugars that I was eating were found in perceived healthy foods.'

'Low fat yoghurts and muesli bars, cereals and fruit juices, sports drinks - these kind of things parents will often give their kids thinking they're doing the right thing,' Gameau told the program.

The actor added that aside from the fact that hidden sugars were having an impact on physical health - as he put on 10 centimetres of visceral fat around his waist - there was also a potentially detrimental mental consequence too.

The full documentary will be released in March 2015.
