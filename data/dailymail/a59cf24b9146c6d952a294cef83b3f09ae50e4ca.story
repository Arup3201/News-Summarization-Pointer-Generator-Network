A San Francisco man is one race away from completing seven marathons in seven days on seven continents.

Tim Durbin is the only American competing in the World Marathon Challenge that started last Saturday Jan. 17 and ends in Sydney on Friday.

So far, the 31-year-old has run six marathons, each 26.2 miles, through snow, rain and jetlag in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai.

'In the last 48 hours I've slept less than 9 hours and ran three marathons,' he said in an email earlier this week.

He said most of his sleep has been on the airplanes between cities with a few hours spent in hotels following the races. 

He did have one full night of rest after running in Chile and before heading to Miami.

Durbin added that the biggest challenge has been the quick turn-around times.

'Twice we have done two marathons in 24 hours. Sleep deprivation will likely be a factor going forward,' he said.

So far, the Morocco marathon was the toughest.

He started running in Marrakech less than 7 hours after he completed the race in Spain.

Durbin is averaging about 5½ hours for each 26.2-mile marathons.

Complete: To complete the seven-day challenge, the participants must run the 26.2 mile distances at Union Glacier, Antarctica; Punta Arenas, Chile; Miami, Florida; Madrid, Spain; Marrakech, Morocco; Dubai; United Arab Emirates; and Sydney, Australia

One More To Go: So far, the 31-year-old has run six marathons, each 26.2 miles, through snow, rain and jetlag in Antarctica, Chile, Miami, Madrid, Morocco and Dubai

The race in Morocco took nearly six hours.

Durbin spent roughly $37,000 to participate with 11 others, who are from Brazil, India, Great Britain, Hong Kong, France, Finland and Australia.

The World Marathon Challenge is part of a bigger challenge that Durbin started two years ago. In 2013, he started logging his miles for walking, running, cross country skiing and swimming in order to complete the distance around the equator — 24,901 miles before 2022.

'I am just trying to prove to myself that an average person can do what most others think is impossible,' he said. 

'It's a mental challenge as much as it is physical.'

The challenge, beginning in Antarctica, allots the participants only about 170 hours to complete the grueling world marathon, according to the World Marathon Challenge website.

Journey: Durbin has completed a little more than 30 percent of his 24,901-mile journey, traveling 7,492 miles 

To complete the seven-day challenge, the participants must run the  26.2 mile distances at Union Glacier, Antarctica;  Punta Arenas, Chile; Miami, Florida; Madrid, Spain;  Marrakech, Morocco; Dubai; United Arab Emirates; and Sydney, Australia.

Durbin's effort to complete this challenge is part of a bigger plan. In February 2012, Durbin began, what he calls, 'The 10 Year Challenge,' according to Durbin's blog 24901 Experiences. 

Durbin describes the challenge as his goal to walk, run, ski, or swim 24,901 miles from 2013 to 2022.

Durbin wrote: '24,901 miles is the distance around the equator. I chose this distance because I wanted to run/walk the distance around the world.' 

So far, Durbin has completed a little more than 30 percent of his journey, traveling 7,492 miles, according to his blog.
