They fill their monthly magazine pages with glossy photographs of glamorous models wearing expensive clothes, and inform us how we should be dressing each season.

But when it comes to dressing themselves, it would appear that some of the world's loftiest fashion editors do so in the dark. Or at least after a couple of Grey Goose martinis.

Posing for the cameras at Paris Fashion Week at the Balenciaga show at the Observatoire today wearing their finest examples of car crash couture were Anna Dello Russo, editor-at-large and creative consultant for Vogue Japan; former American Vogue editor-at-large and current Contributing Editor Andre Leon Talley; creative director of American Vogue Grace Coddington, and former editor of Vogue France Carine Roitfeld.

Wearing a straw boater, a leather mini-dress, an enormous gold-buckle belt and platform bowling shoes - all accessorised with an exceedingly potent tan - fashionista and editor-at-large of Vogue Japan Anna Dello Russo really made sure she stood out from the rest of the crowd in Paris, arriving at the Balenciaga show at the Observatoire.

Earlier, at the Balmain show at Grand Hotel Intercontinenta, she had opted for a collared floral mini-dress with long sleeves and black patent shoes.

Andre Leon Talley, the former American editor-at-large for Vogue magazine and current Contributing Editor chose to accompany Anna Wintour - the editor of US Vogue who looked typically elegant in a checked dress and a pink cardigan - in a floor-length black cassock and an enormous silver slab necklace.

Andre - who appeared to be channeling either a member of the clergy, or the Grim Reaper - also wore what looked like partially dismembered skiing goggles.

Former model and creative director of American Vogue Grace Coddington, 72, looked very casual at the Balenciaga fashion show on day three wearing a short-sleeved white shirt, black slacks and plimsolls

Anna Wintour's creative director Grace Coddington, a former model who usually looks effortlessly glamorous, decided to dress down for Balenciaga wearing a short-sleeved white shirt, black slacks and black and white plimsolls.

Her only concessions to glamour were a pair of silver hoop earrings and some bright red lipstick.

Meanwhile, representing the French press, Carine Roitfeld, who was editor-in-chief of Vogue France from 2001 to January 31, 2011, also looked a little downplayed.

She wore a mid-length, midriff-baring black sweater and a crumpled black calf-length skirt with green heeled sandals.

And British rapper MIA - not technically an editor, but known for fashion statements and worth a mention - arrived on the clear day wearing a black PVC rain mac.
