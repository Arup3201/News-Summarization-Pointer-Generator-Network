Jose Mourinho has once again insisted that Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech is still a crucial part of his squad.

Chelsea boss Mourinho has decided to put his faith in Belgian keeper Thibaut Courtois this season, forcing Cech to play a supporting role.

The Blues legend has played just 66 minutes of Premier League football so far this season, while also seeing action in Chelsea's less important cup games.

Cech has been linked with a January move away from Stamford Bridge but Mourinho has other ideas. 

He told Yahoo-Eurosport: 'The most important thing is what he brings to the team on the pitch, which is top quality.

'When Courtois was injured against Arsenal and Petr Cech comes to play on minute 20, I was so calm. I wasn't worried about a change of goalkeeper.

'So when you have on the bench a super goalkeeper like Petr Cech this is the most important thing. 

'I have to feed that ambition to keep him... I'm not saying happy happy, because to be happy a player must play every game... but at least to make him feel that we like him, we respect him and we need him.'

Thibaut Courtois has started all of Chelsea's 15 Premier League games so far this season
