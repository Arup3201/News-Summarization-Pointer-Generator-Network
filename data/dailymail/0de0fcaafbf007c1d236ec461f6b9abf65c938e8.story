As London Fashion Week arrives in the capital tomorrow one doctor is asking fashion fans to consider the impact their wardrobe choices may be having upon their health.  

Mr Simon Moyes, a London-based surgeon who specialises in arthroscopic surgery for knee, shoulder, foot and ankle problems, is more used to dealing with aches and pains of professional athletes.

But his city clinics have recently seen a rise in clients complaining of injuries caused by their accessories.

Heavy bags, necklaces and heels like those on Lydia Bright and Ashley Roberts could cause health probelms

'My colleagues and I, within the physiotherapy and personal fitness training arenas, have seen on average about a 20 per cent increase in neck and shoulder problems,' says Mr Moyes.

'This problem has started to emerge, particularly in the last 2-3 years where patients have attributed their injuries to, for example, heavy bags and flip flops.' 

He has seen multiple ills caused by fashion, such as plantar fasciitis from ill-fitting shoes, nerve trauma caused by weighty, oversized handbags and even cervical pain from excessive ad heavy accessories.

Could following the latest trends be causing you long-term health problems?

1. Heavy necklaces

Mr Moyes says: 'Heavy necklaces are growing in popularity in modern fashion, and this in combination with the use of heavier handbags can produce protraction of the shoulder, curvature in the upper dorsal or thoracic spine and hyperextension of the lower cervical spine, which tends to force the head to thrust forwards. This can place a lot of strain on the base of the neck, causing lower cervical pain. 

'These two problems on top of poor posture from a desk-based working environment produce a range of conditions that can cause pain in the base of the neck in the upper dorsal spine and pain and impingement in both shoulders. 

'All these things produce tightness and shortening of the upper chest muscles, which produce impingement in the shoulders. 

'Physiotherapists, personal trainers and orthopedic surgeons are seeing more and more patients with pain from these areas and it is very important to try and improve one's posture and general bio mechanics by straightening up the cervical and thoracic spine - you can do this by stretching out the chest muscles, improving posture and by regularly stretching.'

2. Flip-flops

Mr Moyes says: Although flip-flops are cool and comfortable in the heat, they can lead to a common condition called plantar fasciitis.

'This is a very painful condition, which produces pain in the sole of the foot and in the heel mainly on the inside of the foot. The plantar fascia is a thick sheet of tissue that runs from the heel to the ball of the foot supporting the deep layers of muscles and tendons in the foot.

Even shoes you THINK are your friends, like flip flops, are slammed for lack of support

'The lack of arch support and lack of cushioning combined with the way you walk in flip flops can predispose you to this condition. 

'A particularly useful stretch for the plantar fascia is either using customised massage balls or you can also use tennis balls or golf balls. These are massaged directly into the painful areas of the plantar fascia and in the heel. These are combined with regular calf stretches to help relieve the symptoms although it will take a few weeks of such treatment to resolve matters.

'If your gym has a power plate you can combine usage of this with the aforementioned stretching regimes to have a more effective stretch of the plantar fascia and calf muscles and more acutely relieve symptoms. 

'If the symptoms fail to respond to these simple stretching measures and alteration of footwear and activities then ultrasound guided steroid injections can be administered.'

3. High heels

Mr Moyes says: 'Many women prefer to wear high heels and are reliant on them for everyday use, but repeatedly wearing heeled shoes can lead to Achilles tendonitis. The Achilles tendon is the long thin tendon that runs from the base of the calf muscles down to the heel bone. This can become extremely painful due to chronic shortening of the calf muscles by wearing repeatedly high heel shoes. The pain is localised over the tendon and may be associated with thickening and swelling of the tendon.

Heels and heavy handbags could mean double trouble, both put strain on your back and spine

'The consequence of heeled shoes that women are most aware of is the increased risk of developing bunions and calluses, which are known to be aggravated by high heeled shoes, as the heel pushes the front of the foot into the shoe, crowding the toes. These bony growths aren't just unsightly, but can lead to long-term swelling, inflammation and pain.

'The prolonged wearing of high heels can produce hyperextension of the toes by pressing them into rigid unnatural forms. The more stiletto shaped the heel, the worse it is likely to be. The base of the big toe becomes deviated outwards forming a bunion, and, the sesamoid bones, the bones beneath the big toe, get dislodged by the enormous pressures in that area. 

'The good news is that as long as it is only temporary use you should not necessarily damage your foot. You are more likely to develop bunions if you have a family history of this and you are genetically predisposed to the condition as the wearing of such heels may accelerate bunion development. 

'The solution is to avoid wearing heels for extended periods of time and use sensible shoes alongside your killer heels.'

4. Handbags

'Girls' handbags, like men's briefcases, can carry an enormous amount of material that can be surprisingly heavy. 

'The way they are carried over the shoulder can predispose the development of chronic shoulder pain - namely inflammation and impingement of the rotator cuff. 

The heavy weight over the top of the shoulder tends to cause it to be protracted and the downward pressure on the cuff causes rubbing of the tendon. This causes shoulder pain, which is felt over the anterior and lateral deltoid. Patients may end up with pain at night, causing sleep disturbance, as well as pain using their arm at shoulder height.

'There may also be the development of crepitus or noises arising from the shoulder girdle as the arm is moved. 

'To help avoid developing the condition, try to unload the heavier objects from the bag and change shoulders frequently to avoid pressure on one shoulder.'
