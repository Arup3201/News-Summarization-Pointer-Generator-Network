Optimism swept around Goodison Park last summer but Everton’s campaign is delicately poised as they prepare for an FA Cup showdown with West Ham.

A run of four consecutive defeats — their worst sequence of results since December 2005 — has been a great cause for concern and, for the first time in his reign, Roberto Martinez finds his managerial methods questioned and scrutinised.

CONFIDENCE CRISIS

Head back to Everton’s opening fixtures against Leicester City and Arsenal in August. They were slick in both games and should have taken maximum points but conceded late goals to draw twice. That set the tone for them in the Premier League.

They have struggled for fluency and Martinez feels the goals against Leicester and Arsenal inflicted psychological wounds that are yet to heal. The nadir was reached in last week’s dreadful performance at Hull. ‘Those four points we lost really made it very difficult,’ said Martinez. ‘When I say difficult, I mean you are afraid of making a mistake and then you make it. When you play with freedom and you’re on top of your game, those aspects don’t get punished.’

WHY CAN’T THEY KEEP FIT?

Martinez was asked for an injury bulletin at the start of Monday’s press conference and reeled off a succession of experienced names that included Darron Gibson, Steven Pienaar, Leon Osman, Tim Howard, Tony Hibbert and, most significantly, James McCarthy. The Republic of Ireland international — Everton’s standout performer — is again sidelined with hamstring damage and that injury has afflicted a number of players, including Phil Jagielka, Seamus Coleman, Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith this season.

Everton, unusually, only played five games in pre-season, leading to claims, which Martinez refuted, that they were under-cooked. There has been upheaval behind the scenes recently with Danny Donachie, the respected head of medicine, leaving abruptly.

NO CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

Perhaps the most surprising aspect about Everton is how easily breached they are. They have conceded 33 times, the same tally as bottom club Leicester. Only QPR (35) have conceded more.

They have only kept six clean sheets from the 27 matches they have played in all competitions — their last shutout was against Wolfsburg on November 27 — and what has concerned Martinez is the fact they were unable to muster a response against Hull.

‘We can see the goals we conceded are not up to the standard we want,’ he accepted. ‘That is clear. But as a team it is only against Hull I felt the goal, when it went in it, affected us too much. The way we conceded and how it affected us is something very rare.’

THE TWO YOUNG HOPES

Martinez claimed he would have paid £100million to sign Romelu Lukaku in the summer. He ultimately got him for £28m but the Belgian’s performance have lacked swagger and in some games he has been anonymous.

Ross Barkley, meanwhile, has not made the impact expected because of injuries and failing to play in a settled position. He has been stationed, puzzlingly, at times on the flank when he is more potent through the middle.

TENSE ATMOSPHERE

It was said when Martinez arrived 18 months ago the atmosphere at Finch Farm, the club’s training retreat, lifted and the positivity certainly played its part in helping Everton come within a whisker of Champions League qualification.

The downturn in results — coupled with the punishing schedule of Europa League football — means the mood is not as vibrant, though Jagielka recently made a point of emphasising the squad is ‘massively behind’ Martinez.

The Goodison crowd is capable of giving its team tremendous backing but, if they turn, the stadium can be an unforgiving venue; there were growls of frustration when they beat QPR 3-0 last month.

‘The atmosphere at Goodison has only been a little bit shaky because of our expectations,’ said Martinez. ‘I think now the crowd understands we are in a difficult position and that we have to help each other.’

DEALING WITH PRESSURE

One of Martinez’s strengths is not getting flustered, either by the sequence of results or the focus on his position. He is also certain in his methods and will not resort to changing his tactics for the sake of a quick fix.

‘The truth is that I feel under the same pressure when we win and when we lose because I always look forward,’ he said. ‘My vision is to create a winning team. Losing games forces you to try and find solutions, to look inside in a different way than when you win.’

Aside from that, there is also a strong relationship with chairman Bill Kenwright. 

‘He is an Evertonian and really cares about the club — results are paramount,’ said Martinez. 

‘The support I got from day one has been incredible and really helps in moments like the one we are experiencing now.’
