The parents of a 5-month-old were shocked when police showed up to take away their infant boy after they told a doctor they wanted a second opinion.

Caught on camera, the footage shows police entering the California home of Anna and Alex Nikolayev and asking Anna to hand over the baby.

‘I’m going to grab your baby,’ one of the several officers at the scene told Nikolayev, ‘And don’t resist and don’t fight me.’

Surprise: Anna and Alex Nikolayev wanted a second opinion after doctors at a Sacramento hospital made them too nervous to leave son Sammy (pictured) in their care

‘He grabbed my arm,’ the new mother told KXTV, ‘so I couldn't take Sammy. And they took Sammy, and they just walked away."

The saga began about two weeks ago when Sammy, who suffers from a heart murmur, began showing flu-like symptoms.

The Nikolayevs took him to Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento, California, the hospital where Sammy had been receiving regular treatment for his heart condition.

According to Anna, the couple became alarmed after a nurse came in to give the baby antibiotics.

Uncomfortable: Anna Nikolayev (left, with Alex) says the hospital made mistakes and they just weren't comfortable when doctors started discussing heart surgery

‘I asked her, “For what is that?” And she's like, “I don't know.”'

How,
 Anna wondered, was the woman working as a nurse but unaware of the 
purpose of a medication? Anna said a doctor would later tell her Sammy 
did not need antibiotics.

While
 still at Sutter, Sammy was admitted to the pediatric ICU for 
observation. Within a few days, doctors began discussing the possibility
 of heart surgery for the baby.

Motivated
 by fear, Anna took Sammy from the hospital without a proper discharge 
and admitted him to another hospital, Kaiser Permanente.

Taken: Though they got OK'd from a different hospital to take Sammy home, police let themselves in the next day and took Sammy into protective services

Harsh: Anna, left, said CPS told her Sammy was taken due to the Nikolayev's 'severe neglect' and Alex, right, said he met police at the door and they threw him to the ground before entering the home and taking Sammy

‘I don't want to have my baby have surgery in the hospital where I don't feel safe,’ Anna explained.

Police then showed up at the second hospital.

‘They told us that Sutter was telling them so much bad stuff that they thought that this baby is dying on our arms,’ Anna said.

At Kaiser Permanente, the doctor indicated on the infant's records that he was clinically safe to go home with the Nikolayevs and that there was no concern for the Sammy’s safety in their care. They went home.

On April 24, the police arrived at 
their house. Alex said he greeted them and was pushed to the ground when
 he asked if he was being arrested. They then took Sammy away.

Extreme: Anna said the doctors at Sutter Memorial (pictured) in Sacramento, California had police convinced she and her husband were bad parents

Differing: While one hospital suggested surgery, another, Kaiser Permanente (pictured) OK'd Sammy to go home with his parents

According
 to Anna, a child protective services worker told her Sammy was taken 
away for ‘severe neglect’ but did not elaborate on the neglect.

KXTV reached out to Sutter Memorial 
and were told to contact child protective services. Reporters were told 
by CPS that they couldn't comment on individual cases.

CPS spokesperson Laura McCasland told
 the ABC affiliate, 'We conduct a risk assessment of the child's safety 
and rely heavily on the direction of health care providers.'

The Nikolayevs were allowed an hour of visitation with Sammy on Thursday.

An outraged Alex told KXTV. ‘It seems like parents have no right whatsoever.’

‘We
 did everything,’ a tearful Anna agreed. ‘We went from one hospital to 
another. We just wanted to be safe, that he is in good hands.’

A court date hearing was set for April 29.

Uncertain: Sammy remains in the care of authorities, with his fate to be determined April 29
