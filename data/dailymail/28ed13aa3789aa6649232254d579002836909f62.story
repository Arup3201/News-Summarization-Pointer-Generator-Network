A 23-year-old man has become the fifth person to die after a house fire in Denbighshire.

She

'They were such little stars. They were always so happy, they were a joy and loved everything about life.'

Family tributes were also paid to Lee-AnnaÂ  who was described as 'a kind, loving and caring person'.
