Children's books are becoming increasingly violent because they have to compete with gory video games, a bestselling children's author has claimed.

Writer Robert Muchamore – whose hit Cherub series has sold more than eight million copies worldwide – said youngsters are more and more desensitised to violence because they see it so often on their TV and computer screens.

But he said he is happy to put 'brutal' material in books as long as it passes what he terms the 'EastEnders test', meaning anything that would be seen on the gritty BBC soap is acceptable in his own stories.

Mr Muchamore also hit out at 'white, grey-haired, elderly' writers such as War Horse author Michael Morpurgo and Jacqueline Wilson, saying they are seen as 'deeply uncool' and turn teenagers off books.

He told the Daily Mail: 'My competition is not Swallows and Amazons or Enid Blyton. My competition is Halo 5 and Grand Theft Auto and the Avengers Assemble movie.

'I think if you make kids' books too twee and say there should be no violence and they should all be about nice cosy little worlds, it is like fighting with one arm tied behind your back.

'I think my EastEnders test is quite a nice one, because it is still the most watched programme in the country by teens. When I'm writing something I ask 'Would this get by in an episode of EastEnders?'

In 2011, Mr Muchamore's books were 
banned from the library of Highgate junior school in north London after 
parents complained they were unsuitable for their children.

The 41-year-old claims it was a misunderstanding prompted when he was booked to speak to the school's primary age children.

He said he would never recommend his own Cherub novels – about a division of the British intelligence services that recruit young orphans as agents – to anyone under the age of 12.

But he claimed the recent bestseller The Hunger Games has raised the bar of what is acceptable in children's literature.

He said: 'Children of nine and ten are reading The Hunger Games and it is such an incredibly violent book. It is basically a book about kids thrown into an arena to kill each other. The depiction is brutal. In terms of violence that is a real game changer.'

He added: 'Sometimes people say to me the violence in your books is brutal and nasty and depicted in detail. I actually think that is quite important.

'If someone in my book gets punched in the face the next day they have a swollen eye, and maybe they have to go to hospital to have a detached retina looked at, and maybe they feel guilty about it.

'There are consequences. What I dislike is cartoonish violence.

'I don't put in graphic sex 
scenes, and the swear words are pretty tame. And if children don't like 
it, they will self-censor and put it down.'

Mr Muchamore insisted authors need to keep younger readers interested, even if it means including material that would have been deemed unacceptable in the past.

He said: 'We went through this phase with children's laureates, with Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo and Julia Donaldson and they were all these white, grey haired elderly people.

'They would all be on the news talking about the nice cosy world of children's books and how lovely it was to sit in a library. And I was sat there thinking about 12 and 13 year old kids who would think how uncool it all was, and why would they ever bother reading books.'
