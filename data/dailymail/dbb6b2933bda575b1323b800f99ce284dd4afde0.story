Pop sensation Katy Perry set Neymar's tongue wagging on Monday night, as he recorded footage of her performing a gig in Barcelona.

Just 24 hours after the Brazilian impressed at the Nou Camp to help his side beat Levante 5-0, he turned his attention to Palau Sant Jordi and the first date of Perry's European tour.

And the 23-year-old seemed impressed by her performance, uploading a video of the gig to his 15 and a half million followers on Instagram.

Neymar appears to have seats directly next to the stage, as the video shows Perry walk in front of the Barcelona star, just metres from the camera. 

The crowd of 24,000 is nothing compared to the one Neymar performed in front of just one night previous though, as 74,963 were in attendance to watch the Brazilian score his 24th goal of the season.

He opened the scoring for Luis Enrique's side in the first half, before a Lionel Messi hat-trick and a goal from Luis Suarez secured a straightforward win for Barcelona against Levante.

24 hours previous, Neymar scored the first of Barcelona's five goals against Levante at the Nou Camp
