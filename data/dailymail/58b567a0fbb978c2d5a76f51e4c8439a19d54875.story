The company hosting the frozen data of millions of users of the file sharing site Megaupload have said their bill must be paid or be allowed to delete the data.

Carpathia Hosting said it is using more than 1,100 servers to store the 25 million gigabytes of the website's data - it has been  inaccessible since the site was seized by the FBI.

The company filed an emergency motion this week in a U.S. federal court in Virginia seeking protection from the expense of hosting the data of up to 66 million users.

Loss: Carpathia Hosting said it is paying $9,000 a day to host the data. In January, U.S. authorities shut down the Megaupload site and worked with authorities in New Zealand to have its founder, Kim Dotcom, pictured, arrested

The Virginia-based company said it is paying $9,000 (£5,700) a day to host the data, which works out to more than $500,000 (£316,600) since January.

That is when U.S. authorities shut down the Megaupload site and worked with authorities in New Zealand to have its founder, Kim Dotcom, arrested.

U.S. prosecutors are seeking Dotcom's extradition from New Zealand, where he remains under house arrest.

They accuse him of racketeering by facilitating millions of illegal downloads of copyrighted material on the site.

Justification: Megaupload says many of its users are legitimate and storing important files on the site

Warning: Users trying to access the Megaupload website get this message from the FBI

Megaupload says many of its users are legitimate and storing important files on the site.

Earlier this month Kim Dotcom, said the site's legal team was 'negotiating' with the US Department of Justice to allow people access to personal files.

In January, Carpathia said it would work with a nonprofit group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to try to preserve the data.

Megaupload leased 1,103 servers located in both the U.S. and Canada from Carpathia.

In its court filing, the company said it had so far refrained from deleting the data given the interest from so many parties in keeping it.

Among those asking for the data to be saved is the Motion Picture Association of America, which wants it kept for possible civil action.

Carpathia said another reason it 
can't delete the data at the moment is because it would 'risk a claim by
a party with an interest in the data.'

It
is asking the court to either have others take possesion of the data, 
ensure that Carpathia be paid until the completion of the case or let it
delete the data after allowing users access for a brief period for 
selective copying.

Carpathia is seeking a court hearing on the motion next month.

A
few weeks ago Kim Dotcom claimed that 'a large number' of US government
officials are members of his file-sharing website and said he hoped he 
would soon be able to give them permission to access their accounts.

Leniency: Dotcom is now allowed up to 60,000 New Zealand dollars ($49,000) per month from his frozen bank accounts to pay for his living expenses as he prepares his defence. He is also allowed the use of one of his cars, a 2011 Mercedes Benz

Speaking to the Torrentfreak blog this week, Dotcom said: 'Guess what – we found a large number of Mega accounts from US Government officials including the Department of Justice and the US Senate.

'I hope we will soon have permission to give them and the rest of our users access to their files.'

Dotcom's comments sparked speculation he may be prepared to name the officials when the case comes to trial.

In another development in the case, a judge in New Zealand on Thursday released a ruling that Dotcom be allowed up to 60,000 New Zealand dollars ($49,000) per month from his frozen bank accounts to pay for his living expenses as he prepares his defence.

He is also allowed the use of one of his cars, a 2011 Mercedes Benz.

New Zealand authorities in January seized Dotcom's assets, which included 10 million New Zealand dollars ($8.1 million) worth of bonds and a fleet of luxury cars.
