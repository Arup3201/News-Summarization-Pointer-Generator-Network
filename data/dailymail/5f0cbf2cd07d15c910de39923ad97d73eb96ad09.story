Former England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard has labelled Kevin Pietersen 'a very bitter man' and does not see any way back for the 34-year-old in international cricket.

Pietersen, sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board eight months ago, has been highly critical of some of his former team-mates and former team director Andy Flower in his autobiography, which went on general sale on Thursday.

In an interview with the Evening Standard, the 34-year-old claimed he could yet return to international cricket - if ECB chairman Giles Clarke departed the scene - but Hoggard thinks that idea is fanciful.

Former England fast bowler Matthew Hoggard has labelled Kevin Pietersen 'a very bitter man'

'I think it's a little bit tit for tat,' the Yorkshireman said of this week's war of words.

'I think he's a very bitter man. I think Kevin Pietersen wanted to get rid of Andy Flower when he was the captain as well, so I think there's a little bit of personal vindictiveness in there.

'But man-management is part of the skill of being a good leader and a good coach. If Andy Flower had been lacking and hadn't been able to rein in one of the best England players we've had in recent years, it's a very sad state of affairs.'

Asked whether he thought there was a way back into the international fold for Pietersen, Hoggard replied on Sky Sports News: 'No.'

'KP: The Autobiography' includes Pietersen's account of a culture of 'bullying' in the dressing room under Flower's regime and allegedly orchestrated largely by Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Matt Prior.

Prior came in for most stinging criticism, tagged the 'schoolyard bully who was also the teacher's pet'.

Hoggard defended his former team-mate, saying: 'His nickname is "The Big Cheese". He came from Sussex with the name "The Big Cheese".

'I've played a lot of cricket with Matt Prior. He's very much a team man, very much wants to win, demands high standards and wants to push everybody. I don't know if he's a bully - he does have high standards and wants everybody to achieve the best they can do.'

Former Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood, speaking at a wine-tasting event at Lord's, struggled to contain his laughter when asked whether he could see Pietersen in an England shirt again.

'I would have thought there'd be no chance after this book's come out, to be honest, but you never know what happens in the future!' he said.

'I'm sure if he got back in the nets and played for a county and scored the runs he'd put the pressure on them.

'(But) certainly there's a few people disgruntled with his book, so I can't imagine that'll happen in the near future.'

Collingwood, who retired from Test cricket in 2011, played down talk of bullying within the England camp, but acknowledged there were 'niggles' and 'discrepancies'.

'I think 'bullying' is probably a very strong word,' he said. 'It's quite disappointing that people are forgetting these times we've had over last seven years have been one of probably most successful times in English cricket. It's been a great era - we've won three Ashes, a Twenty20 World Cup.

'If there was so much going on behind the scenes, I'd be very surprised if you could go on and win all these things. You're always going to have niggles in a team environment. The England team travel around together probably 300 days a year, so you're always going to have behind-the-scenes niggles going on, but in the end the performance on the pitch is what counts.

'You always get discrepancies in the dressing room. How you iron things out is the main thing, and how you move forward. There are times when players go overboard. But as long as you can have a beer with these guys and move forward, all should be good.'

He added: 'I wouldn't say KP was the easiest to manage, but he was manageable at the time I played. The last two years I haven't been involved with the dressing room. The sad thing is it looks as though it's all broken up, the relationships in the dressing room.'
