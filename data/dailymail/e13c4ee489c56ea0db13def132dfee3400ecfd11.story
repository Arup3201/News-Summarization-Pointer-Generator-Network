Search teams are looking for Sebastian Kinasiewicz after he went missing on Oregon's Mount Hood

A Polish military man, 32, has been found dead after a fall from near the summit of Oregon's Mount Hood.

Sebastian Kinasiewicz was reported missing on Monday by his roommate after he failed to return on Sunday.

Crews found his car at a trailhead, but a daylong search of two routes that start at that point failed to determine his whereabouts.

The search resumed today using a helicopter with equipment that can identify a signal from an international cellphone, Hood River County sheriff's Sgt. Pete Hughes said.

Kinasiewicz was carrying water and warm clothing but no sleeping bag or food and wasn't equipped to stay out overnight.

Hughes said conditions hd been survivable, and hypothermia and moisture would not be a problem above ground.

Kinasiewicz was described online as a novice climber who has had survival training, Hughes said.

Two teams of searchers headed up the mountain today, joined by a National Guard helicopter. One team had 13 members.

Kinasiewicz has been in the U.S. for drone training at the Insitu Inc. in Bingen, Wash.

'Our thoughts are with Sebastian's family at this difficult time,' VInsitu spokeswoman Jill Vacek said in a statement.

There have been multiple climbers gone missing while attempting Oregon's Mount Hood

Mount Hood, the tallest mountain in 
Oregon, is a popular climbing site that has seen dozens of accidents and
fatalities over the years.

Thousands
of people climb the peak each year, mostly in the spring. Summer 
climbing is more dangerous because warmer temperatures melt the ice and 
loosen rocks.

Mount Hood is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range.

Earlier this month a snowbowder traveling through an ice tunnel on Mt. Hood with five companions was found dead nearly 14 hours after the passageway collapsed on top of him.

Professional snowboarder from Pines, Colorado, Collin Backowski, 25, was trapped under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice, which took 12 rescuers two days to dig him out of.

In June, the body of Salem dentist Kinley K. Adams was found at the top of Sandy Glacier near the Hood River County line, at 8,400 feet high after he had also attempted the climb.

As of May 2003, more than 130 people have died in climbing-related accidents on Mount Hood.
