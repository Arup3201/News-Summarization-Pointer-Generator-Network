Ask any pet owner and they will tell you that their furry, scaly or feathery friends make their lives better in many ways.  Now two animal lovers are sharing the love. 

Julie Edwards is a remedial therapist and yoga teacher in Perth who runs special 4 Paws Yoga classes for pets and their owners.

'I began treating dogs in 2008 and I’m qualified as a therapist for small animals,' Julie told Daily Mail Australia.

Classes involve stretching, using equipment and lots of social time for the dogs

What started as teaching yoga to companion dogs quickly turned into something more, and now Julie runs bigger classes to help dogs bond with their owners and other dogs.

'The classes are run in backyards and people team up and they have doggy friends come over,' Julie said.

'All of the dogs work off lead and use equipment,' she added.

With the aid of pool noodles to help the dogs stretch and other objects the classes run for about an hour, but admittedly include a lot of social time.

'We do a bit of a warm up with the dogs ... (and) the dogs work together as a group but also individually.

Benefits include rehabilitation from injuries, helping the canines develop body awareness and prevent them from injuring themselves.

'Bonding and having fun – that is the key element, bonding,' Julie revealed.

Julie has two dogs of her own - Rosie and Snoopy who are both beagles and said they love a bit of stretching and posing. Her cat however isn't as keen on the idea.

Pets can also indulge in a type of massage therapy, which can help animals with injuries, but also give them a chance to relax.

Emma Kidd, also from Perth runs Bowen therapy for dogs, after discovering the technique when she injured herself a few years back.

'I was a vet nurse for many years; I've worked in the industry or about 10 years,' Emma told Daily Mail Australia.

'I injured myself and to seek alternative solutions for my shoulder injury and I discovered Bowen which was really beneficial.

'It’s not like (traditional) massage, it’s a soft tissue therapy, it helps with common muscular and skeletal problems.'

Emma has treated all sorts of animals from companion pets and show dogs, to dressage and racing horses - and even camels.

She does a lot of work with retired competition animals but also looks after smaller pets

She said the benefits include recovery, helping animals into retirement if they were competitive, or just as a relaxation technique.

'It's about well-being for the animals the same as we treat ourselves and get a massage,' Emma said.

The Perth woman said she uses the techniques on her own pets, a horse called William, her two retired greyhounds Max and Roxy and her borzoi (a Russian wolf hound) Merlin.

New research shows pet owners are more likely to live happier and healthier lives alongside their furry friends

Now new research backs up their feelings, revealing that having a pet may have many benefits for their owner from helping them recover from a heart attack or reduce stress to getting them out and exercising.

Those who spend time with their animal companions are likely to be repaid with a happier, healthier and longer life, and there is psychological evidence to confirm this released just in time for Love Your Pet Day on Friday.

Australian universities, in partnership with the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition and Mars Petcare, have for decades conducted globally recognised research into the positive benefits of pet ownership.

'Pet owners often mention the care and affection they give their pets and the sense of wellbeing they receive from having pets in their lives, Dr Kersti Seksel, veterinary specialist at the Sydney Animal Behaviour Service said.

'It’s a mutually beneficial relationship that can help humans stay physically and emotionally healthy from childhood well into old age.'

Don't forget to pamper your pet on Friday for Love Your Pet Day.
