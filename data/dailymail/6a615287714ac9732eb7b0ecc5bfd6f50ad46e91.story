Scotland's Dan Purvis has won Commonwealth gold in the men's parallel bars final at Glasgow's SSE Hydro after seeing off the challenge of England's triple gold medallist Max Whitlock.

The 23-year-old Scot produced a stunning routine which scored 15.533 to take the title ahead of England's Nile Wilson who won silver with 15.433, while floor, all-around and team champion Whitlock had to settle for bronze with 15.066.

Purvis, who had already won team silver and rings bronze, upgraded to gold on the final day of competition after being the last gymnast to perform on the apparatus.

Champion: Scotland's Purvis put in a brilliant performance to clinch gold ahead of his English rivals

Wilson, who won all-around bronze on Wednesday, punched the air on his dismount after a near faultless performance which looked to have landed him his first individual gold of the Games having competed as a junior as recently as May, where he was crowned junior European all-around champion.

However, an even more impressive showing by Southport-based Purvis snatched the medal in a dramatic conclusion, with the roar of home support fully behind the popular gymnast.

Whitlock was the first to compete on the apparatus and delivered an icy-cool routine which bested every score in qualifying before team-mate Wilson delivered an even more impressive mark as England held gold and silver medal position straight off the bat.

Canada's Zachary Clay came off the apparatus to go out of contention with Australia's Luke Wadsworth also not troubling the podium.

Scotland's Baines was next up and the 19-year-old moved into bronze medal position with a score of 14.866 with three gymnasts left to compete.

Canada's Kevin Lytwyn slotted in behind Baines before Australia's Naoya Tsukahara then went fourth with a tally of 14.133.

That left England still on the top two steps of the podium with just Purvis to compete and the Scot stepped up and delivered one of the best routines of his career on the piece to claim gold in his last event of the Games.
