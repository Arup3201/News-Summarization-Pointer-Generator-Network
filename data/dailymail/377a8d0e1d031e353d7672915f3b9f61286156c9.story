Powerful enemy: Alienating Mrs Merkel, whose power in Europe is almost unrivalled, could damage the PM's chance of bringing about change

David Cameron’s hopes of renegotiating Britain’s role in the EU suffered a major blow yesterday as Tory MEPs teamed up with Germany’s answer to Ukip.

In a snub to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, they agreed to form a group in the European Parliament with Alternativ fur Deutschland (AfD), Eurosceptics who are implacably opposed to Mrs Merkel.

Alienating Mrs Merkel, whose power in Europe is almost unrivalled, could seriously damage the Prime Minister’s chance of bringing about change.

A Tory spokesman last night said it was ‘very disappointing’ that the European Conservatives and Reform group had  chosen to accept AfD – although some Tory MEPs are thought to have voted for it.

The rift with Mrs Merkel undermines Mr Cameron’s bid to rough out a new deal with Europe before his planned in/out  referendum on EU membership in 2017.

Mats Persson, of think-tank Open Europe, said the decision to cosy up to the AfD was ‘not helpful at all’ to Mr Cameron.

He went on to say: ‘If the objective is sweeping reform of the EU, for which you need Angela Merkel’s support, then it is not a good idea to team up with a party that is actively campaigning against her in her own country.’

The decision also scuppers an informal deal between the two leaders in which Mrs Merkel would soft-pedal on her support for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker, her favoured candidate for  European Commission president, in return for Mr Cameron vetoing a deal with AfD by Tories in the European Parliament.
