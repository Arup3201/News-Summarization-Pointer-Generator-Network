Look away now, England fans.  As if Thursday's night's result wasn't bad enough, Bloomberg Sports have now claimed Roy Hodgson's side have only a measly 13 per cent chance of progressing from Group D.

England are relying on Italy to beat both Costa Rica and Uruguay if they are to stand any hope of qualifying for the knockout phase of the World Cup; but their chances of doing so stand at only 12.9 per cent, according to the world's leaders in sports analytics technology.

Italy, who beat England in their Group D clash on Saturday, have a healthy 86 per cent chance of making the last 16 while Costa Rica, whom the Italians face later on Friday, have a 1 in 2 hope of progressing to the latter stages of the competition.

Uruguay, with a fit and firing Luis Suarez to call upon following his brace against the Three Lions, have a 47 per cent hope of progressing from Group D.

Meanwhile, former England winger Chris Waddle was among those to hit out at England's lacklustre display.

The former England winger turned on the culture of the Premier League after watching the Three Lions fall to the brink of World Cup exit.

Focussing on the impact he feels the Premier League - and its foreign players - has on the side he won 62 caps for, he said: 'I'm not angry, I'm just fed up of talking about the same old problems.

'I'll tell you what the biggest problem is when you think about it all - the Premier League. They have a product which they sell around the world. It's entertaining but it's doing our players no good whatsoever.

'This (England) is a Premier League side playing tonight which is meant to be the best league in the world. You're not telling me all those Uruguayan players would get in many teams around the world, apart from (Luis) Suarez who was only 75 per cent fit. (Edinson) Cavani possibly. Apart from that, who else is there?'

The former Sheffield Wendesday man went on to add that he feels it is players like two-goal Suarez who makes the Premier League what it is.

"We go on banging the drum that we've got this and that.. Do you know what makes the Premier League exciting? Players like Luis Suarez - the foreign players,' he said.

'We hype our players up massively like we always do, say we've got this and that.

'Look at their (Uruguay's) back four tonight. The kid at centre-half (Jose Maria Giminez) he's played two games for Atletico Madrid, he's not had a cap, but they know how to win games.

'The difference between Premier League football and international football is how to win a football match. It's not about picking your star players, he plays for Liverpool, he plays for Man U, it's about getting a balance in the side to get a result and we never, ever do.'
