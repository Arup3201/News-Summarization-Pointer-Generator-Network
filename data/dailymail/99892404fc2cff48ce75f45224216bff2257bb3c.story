It’s been a long time coming but  Ashford Castle, one of Ireland’s oldest and best-loved castles has been renovated and reopened to the public.

Of its eighty two rooms and suites which overlook the sprawling wooded 350-acre estate and Lough Corrib – Ireland’s second largest lake – 30 have been redone this year.

Huge restoration work has been underway including the intricate overhaul of the building’s infrastructure, including stonework, windows and roofs, as well as modern updates like air conditioning and WiFi.

The remaining 52 rooms will be given a face lift between January and March 2015 when the medieval castle is closed for winter. Additions will include a private theatre, a cigar room and a spa extension.

But, for now, you could do an awful lot worse than visit the spectacularly turreted fortress which sits 35 miles northeast of Galway in County Mayo. The original property was founded by the Anglo-Norman de Burgo family in 1228 and has a guestbook which reads like a  who’s who.

A cosmos of stars such as John Wayne and Maureen O’Hara (who stayed in rooms 408 and 500 - the only turret rooms in the castle), England’s King George V, US President Ronald Reagan and Beatles star John Lennon have checked in over the years. 

For €134 (£105) you can stay in their most basic Corrib standard rooms for one night but stretch to €12,118 (£9,510) and you’ll get three nights (minimum stay) in the recently restored master suite which includes the best views in the house, a sitting room area, writing desk, trouser press and sherry decanter.

In the nick of time: the five star hotel castle was bought in May last year by Red Carnation Hotels who paid €20 million for the struggling property

Choose a stateroom from €285 (£224) a night and you'll sleep in some of the oldest sections of the castle dating back to the 13th and 17th centuries. Most Staterooms contain traditional four-poster beds and feature original fireplaces with antique furniture.

The hotel emerged, battle-weary, from receivership in May last year after Red Carnation Hotels paid €20 million for the Co Mayo resort and helped secure its future.

Since then they've invested great swathes of cash into its upheaval and the renovation of public rooms and gardens.

A hub of activity, once there, guests can go water-skiing, take part in archery or clay pigeon shooting, play on the golf course, fish in the lough or ride horses along the coast line. 

Best of all, the castle has a falconry school where you can learn to fly a Harris hawk around the grounds with a raptor expert by your side, or meet Dingle the resident owl.

A visit to the opulent newly refurbished George V dining room is a must. Sit beneath 11 huge Waterford crystal chandeliers and choose to make your way through the five star castle’s five- or seven- course tasting menus of locally sourced lamb, fish, and shellfish and meat carving trolley. 

There’s also an extensive wine menu of exclusive wines from the new owner’s South African winery.

What a catch! Once there guests can take their pick of activities including fishing,  water-skiing, archery, clay pigeon shooting or horse riding

As you might expect, there's  a spa where visitors can take their pick of aroma stone body massages or a toning body polishes using Guerande sea salt grains, amongst others.

One of the most charming things about the fort, which is steeped in history and was owned for 90 years by the Guinness family, is its longevity. That’s no more so true than with its staff. 40 per cent have been there for 20 or more years and 55 per cent have 15-plus years’ service under their belt, with the majority living in Cong or nearby villages.
