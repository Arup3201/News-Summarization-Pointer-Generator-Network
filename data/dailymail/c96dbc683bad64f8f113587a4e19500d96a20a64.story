Travel operator Thomas Cook has reassured customers of its commitment to animal welfare after a dog was crushed to death at one it’s resorts in Cyprus.

The firm said it was ‘extremely concerned’ by the tragic incident at the Anastasia Beach Hotel where staff had apparently tried to dispose of the stray poodle named Billy in a large recycling bin fitted with an electrically-operated crushing mechanism.

The seven-month-old puppy was found 
by holidaymakers lying at the bottom of the bin still alive, but having 
suffered horrific injuries including a broken back and brain damage.

Anger: British expats and tourists protest at the Anastasia hotel in Cyprus where stray puppy Billy was thrown in a crusher bin before he died

Appalled tourists called a local vet to the scene but the dog died within days.

Expats
 and tourists had called for a boycott of the hotel and thousands of 
people have signed a petition calling for Cyprus to enforce animal 
cruelty laws.

Thomas
 Cook said in a statement: ‘Once these allegations came to light, we 
immediately liaised with the Tsokkos Hotel Group, which is offering its 
full cooperation to the local authorities following the launch of a full
 investigation.

‘We have been informed that the staff members involved were immediately dismissed following the incident.

The
 company said it had received enquiries from concerned customers, who 
were subsequently told that it was an isolated incident.

Antonis Alkiviades, who works at MedVets, 
the surgery which cared for Billy, said: ‘When we went to the hotel, he 
was already in a coma. We were shocked and it was even more of a shock 
when we were told he was put into this bin.’

Mr 
Alkiviades said Billy had a broken back and other broken bones and was 
unable to breathe. Vets later realised he had brain damage.

Billy
 was visited by dozens of concerned locals and tourists. Briton Lynn 
Gandy, 61, said: ‘He looked terrible. He was a poor, frail, little dog. 
To think somebody could throw a live animal into a crusher beggars 
belief. It is savagery.’

Another woman said the local reaction to Billy’s death had been so fierce that she feared there would be riots.

On Friday, British tourists joined expats marching outside the Anastasia, which is part of the Tsokkos group, Cyprus’s largest hotel chain. They held banners with slogans reading ‘Punish people who abuse animals’ and ‘Support Billy’s Law and stop animal cruelty now’ while also chanting ‘Justice for Billy’.

Ross Breakwell, from London, who was on holiday in Cyprus, said: ‘I never imagined a country within the European Union could be so lax when it comes to something as important as animal rights.

‘I’m shocked and disgusted by this incident. It will make me think twice before coming back to Cyprus and I definitely would never stay in a Tsokkos hotel. All tourists to Cyprus should boycott the company.’

Mr Alkiviades also called for tougher laws on the island. He said: ‘You have the RSPCA in the UK. We don’t. We need people to be able to reinforce laws and punish cruelty.’

Popular tourist destination: Cyprus attracts thousands of holidaymakers every year

Nicos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus, condemned Billy’s death and described the incident as ‘a disgrace for society and our country’.

Tsokkos Hotels said: ‘Hotel management received complaints from customers about the fact that a sick stray puppy wandered around. The hotel manager immediately gave instructions to two employees to take the puppy to a local shelter to obtain appropriate care.

‘Unfortunately, the employees did not follow the instructions and proceeded to an inhuman act, unacceptable and condemnable by Tsokkos Hotels. 

'As soon as Tsokkos Hotels became aware of the incident, the puppy was transferred to a veterinary clinic to receive all necessary treatment.’
