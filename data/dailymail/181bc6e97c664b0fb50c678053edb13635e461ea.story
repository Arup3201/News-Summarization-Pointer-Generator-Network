Won't apologize: Mariah Carey is pictured with her manager, Jermaine Dupri. Dupri was the person responsible for setting up a concert for the president of Angola which has now been criticized by human rights organizations

Mariah Carey angered human rights groups this week after it was revealed she accepted $1million to perform in a private concert for the president of Angola, the second-longest serving dictator in office. 

The singer's manager Jermaine Dupri organized the gig for President Josè Eduardo Dos Santos, and remained unapologetic when questioned by the Human Rights Foundation. 

Instead, Dupri pointed the blame at the Red Cross, and even said that Carey doesn't involve herself with human rights matters.

Critics of Dos Santos claim he has murdered many politicians, journalists and other people who have defied orders, as well as monopolizing and exploiting oil and diamond resources and seizing control of almost all aspects of government and power.

'I don't feel like we have done anything wrong,' Dupri told the New York Post, admitting that he didn't research Dos Santos before the trip. 'The president of the United States took pictures with this guy's daughter and congratulated this man on his many years of being in office. If he can rub shoulders with these people than why is Mariah Carey being accused of doing something wrong?'

Mariah's show was sponsored by Unitel, a mobile-phone company owned by Dos Santos' daughter, Isabel.

His daughter is also head of the Angolan Red Cross, which reportedly received $65,000 in benefit funds from the concert.

Dupri said that the idea for the concert was proposed by an intermediary for the Red Cross, asking 'Why don't you attack them?'

He also alleged that Carey didn't even know Dos Santos was there, though she said during the performance how honored she was to share the show with the Angolan president. After the show, a professional photographer snapped Carey smiling with Dos Santos and his family. 

This isn't the first time that Carey has drawn heat for taking money from a shady leader.

In 2008 she performed in a concert for Muammar Gadaffi, the former leader of Libya who has since been assassinated.

After that incident, Carey pledged 'to take more responsibility' for her bookings. As for the Gadaffi incident, Dupri says he wasn't around when that happened, and can't speak about the situation.

Still, he says she has no reason to be remorseful for her most recent performance.

Human Rights Foundation president Thor Halvorssen spoke with Dupri over the phone this week.

'He [Dupri] said "She is not sorry"' Halvorssen said, adding that Dupri told him that Carey is 'not involved in human rights matters'.

Dupri denied he said any of that.

'That guys trying to twist my words and make it seem like I don't give a f*** about nothing' Dupri responded.

But Halvorssen said it's clear that Dupri could care less.

'Dupri exemplifies the hypocrisy, the greed, and the willful ignorance of managers and performers who pose for photos at human rights events one day and accept copious amounts of blood diamond money on the next day,' Halvorssen said.

The performance comes six months after Jennifer Lopez was forced to apologize for singing 'Happy Birthday' to the repressive dictator of Turkmenistan's brutal regime.

Lopez reportedly changed into a traditional Turkmen outfit during her June show and personally serenaded Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow - whose government is accused of arbitrarily arresting and torturing political dissidents.

Human Rights Watch ranks Turkmenistan as 'among the most repressive in the world.'
