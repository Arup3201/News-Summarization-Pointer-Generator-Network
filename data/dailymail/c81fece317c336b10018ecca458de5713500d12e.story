It was an unexpectedly human gesture, more often used by racetrack touts and X Factor contestants than newly appointed pontiffs.

Yesterday, at a conference for the world’s media, Pope Francis gave  a double thumbs-up to the audience confirming, in no uncertain terms, that this is going to be a very different style of papacy.

We already know Francis has a refreshing disdain for the trappings of office – preferring the bus to the papal limousine and rejecting the red kangaroo-leather shoes which were specially handmade for his predecessor Benedict XVI (also a fan of Gucci glasses) in favour of a pair of scuffed black lace-ups.

Man of the people: The then Cardinal visits a village in Argentina in 2000

Yesterday, in a 15-minute speech, the
 former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires underlined this 
unassuming approach, setting out his plans for a ‘church for the poor’.

At the same time, he proved he could 
work even the toughest of crowds by instantly charming 4,000 journalists
 who had gathered at the Aula Paolo VI centre in the Vatican.

The hall was filled with reporters 
from around the globe – as well as children and babies in buggies after 
he told them to bring their families.

Francis was gracious, addressing the 
hacks as ‘dear friends’ and thanking them for their work covering the 
conclave that led to his election as the first non-European, first Latin
 American pontiff. ‘You worked hard, eh,’ he joked. ‘You worked hard.’

Pope Francis revealed to journalists his hopes for the church, and how he came to select his name

Despite losing the larger part of one 
lung due to a teenage infection, his voice was strong while he seemed 
younger than his 76 years.

Often departing from his script,  
typed on a couple of A4 sheets, Francis folded it up at one point so he 
could talk more freely. He showed a surprising sense of humour and has 
an almost mischievous giggle.

Recalling the moment when the  
cardinals were counting the votes of the secret ballot, Francis said he 
was sitting next to Cardinal Claudio Hummes, Archbishop Emeritus of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, ‘when the matter became dangerous’ – in that it was 
becoming clear he could win.

When he won the two-thirds majority 
needed, Francis – the first Pope to be elected from the Jesuits – said 
Hummes ‘embraced me and kissed me and said, “Don’t forget the poor.”

The pope thanked the media and told them how he had come to choose his name, saying he wanted Francis of Assisi who represented 'poverty and peace'

Pope Francis I greeted a blind journalist and his guide dog, and warmly greeted those who had come to hear him speak

‘And that word went in here,’ Francis
 said, pointing to his head and confirming that Francis of Assisi had 
been the inspiration for his papal name.

A humble sole...

‘That’s how in my heart came the name 
Francis of Assisi... for me he is a man of poverty, a man of peace,
 a man who loved and protected Creation. Right now our relations with 
Creation are not going well.

‘Francis of Assisi gives us this 
spirit of peace, the poor man who wanted a poor church,’ he explained. 
‘How I would love a church this poor and for the poor.’

Two cardinals in red, seated either 
side of him, didn’t know what to make of it all. But there were no 
questions allowed, meaning we couldn’t ask him about the Falklands, 
which he has declared Argentina’s.

Yet there is a genuine air of 
hopefulness around St Peter’s Square. One Vaticanista, as the Vatican 
watchers and correspondents are called, said: ‘Francis is a breath of 
fresh air. He’s said more in 15 minutes than Benedict did in eight 
years. Everything about this guy is different – it’s like a whole new 
world. He’s the real deal.’

The new Pope concluded by offering his apostolic blessing... in silence.

He then received a select group of  
correspondents. In true Pope Francis-style, the line-up included the 
receptionist from the Vatican press office.

The final correspondent was a blind 
man with a guide dog. The Pope bent down and patted his head before 
exiting to a standing ovation.

There was no encore. Although such was
 the jokey nature, I half-expected Michael Palin to leap out shouting: 
‘No one expects the Spanish inquisition.’ That must be left for another 
time.
