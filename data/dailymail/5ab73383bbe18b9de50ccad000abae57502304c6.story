Family and friends of a New Jersey teenager mauled to death by a bull mastiff last week gathered for his funeral on Thursday.

Kenneth Santillan, 13, died after a 115 pound dog attacked him and his friend as they walked home from school in Paterson on Friday.

At his funeral, attended by more than 100 people, the teenager was remembered as being a friendly boy who liked to play practical jokes on his classmates.

Loss: Kenneth had just celebrated his 13th birthday when he was viciously attacked on the way home from school

School friends and neighbors were among those who spoke at the service.

Kenneth's love of the New York Mets was touched on by a neighbor of the family, who drew a short laugh from mourners when he recalled how: '[Kenneth] loved reminding people that the Mets were the best and the Yankees stink.'

Another friend recalled how he found a slice of melted cheese hidden in his math book by Kenneth, who loved practical jokes, North Jersey reported.

A neighbor, who spoke on behalf of the boy's devastated family, added that he loved to flatter his parents, and would often nudge his mother and ask: 'What's 
cooking, good looking?' as she made his favorite barbecue chicken dinner.

The community of Paterson has been shocked by the mauling, which was the first fatal dog attack in the town.

The year-old dog had broken free on Friday and attacked Kenneth and his 13-year-old friend, as well as its owner.

The second school boy was released from hospital this week. Details about the owner's injuries were not clear, Passaic County Assistant Prosecutor Michael DeMarco told NJ.com.

An investigation has been started into the attack, and the dog was euthanized. Its owner, Paul Clarke, has been issued with two summonses.

The woman who gave Clarke the dog, named Trigger, said she was surprised to hear of the attack, and said it would never have happened if she still owned the animal.

Patricia told ABC7: 'Everybody around here knew and loved Trigger. The seniors in the building, it's like he grew up with everybody here.'

She had the dog from when he was an eight-week-old puppy but gave him away because he got too big.

Clarke reportedly had to stab the dog in order to subdue the animal, according to the New York Daily News.

Kenneth and his friend had been walking with the friend along a creek behind Clarke's home when the attack occurred, neighbor Elizabeth Hatsko told MailOnline.

The dog jumped out at the boys, initially attacking the unidentified friend, before they split up.

Clarke
 ran at the dog, and was attacked himself, before stabbing it several 
times to keep it at bay until animal control arrived, according to the Bergen Record.

In the days after the attack, family members left tributes to the teenager on social media.

'RIP the best cousin I've had,' Cassie Nadia commented on a picture posted by Carlos Pastor.

It is not clear if Clarke will face any criminal charges, but a lawyer retained by injured but alive boy's family intends to sue for damages.

'We intend on pursuing a claim for his injuries, certainly,' the attorney told the Record.

Trigger had escaped two times prior to Friday's incident - once he was recovered by Clarke, a second time he was found by Animal Control.

The dog barked a lot and intimidated neighbors, but it had not attacked anyone, Hatsko said.
