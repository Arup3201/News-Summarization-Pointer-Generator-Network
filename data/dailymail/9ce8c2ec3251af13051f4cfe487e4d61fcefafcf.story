Juventus are trying to complete a swoop for Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski.

The Italian club want to take the Germany international, who earns £90,000-per-week, on a loan with a view to a permanent deal.

It is understood Podolski is open to a move to the Serie A club after falling down the pecking order at Arsenal following the arrival of Alexis Sanchez.

Winners: Podolski has returned to Arsenal following his World Cup winning summer with Mesut Ozil 

The Italian champions have informed the Gunners of their interest in the former Bayern Munich man with more discussions planned this week.

Podolski was omitted from the Arsenal squad that drew 2-2 at Everton on Sunday, despite the fact fellow World Cup winners Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker both played at Goodison Park. 

He has played for Arsenal since signing in the summer of 2012, scoring 28 goals in 69 games in his two seasons at the club so far.
