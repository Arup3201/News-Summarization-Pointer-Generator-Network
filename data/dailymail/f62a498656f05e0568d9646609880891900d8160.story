Captain James Townley, 29, from the Corps of Royal Engineers was killed serving in Afghanistan. His death is not believed to be the result of hostile action

A soldier who died in an apparent suicide in Afghanistan the day before his 30th birthday had earned a first-class degree from Oxford University and was ‘unbelievably clever’.

Captain James Townley shot himself in the head while serving at a remote British base in Helmand Province on Friday.

He later died from the gunshot wounds at Camp Bastion, the main base in Afghanistan.

The Ministry of Defence said 
Captain Townley’s death was not thought to be the result of hostile 
action, though an investigation into the circumstances was continuing.

He was one of two British soldiers who died in suspected suicides last Friday taking the number of British fatalities for the week to four.

Capt Townley, who was awarded a 
first-class degree in engineering and computer science from University 
College, Oxford, worked as a tax associate for Pricewaterhouse Coopers 
before attending the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in January 2007.

Lieutenant Col Chas Story, commanding
officer, 28 Engineer Regiment, said: 'James was an exceptional officer,
a great character and unbelievably clever.

'The Regiment is devastated that such
a bright light has gone out - everyone knew him and it was impossible 
not to be drawn in by his passion and humour.

'He was on his third tour of 
Afghanistan and a volunteer for all three. He joined to be a soldier and
he was determined to make the most of all the opportunities he could.

'The regiment will be a poorer place without James.

'In this painful time our thoughts remain with his family, his girlfriend Helen and all his friends.

'He was an outstanding individual and
throughout his life he has made a massive difference to all those he 
encountered. He will never be forgotten.'

Earlier Capt Townley's family described him as their 'guardian angel' and 'hero'.

His family said in a statement: 'James was a wonderful, loving and caring son and brother.

'He was devoted to his girlfriend, Helen.

'He was our guardian angel and our 
hero. We were so proud of him. He touched every part of our lives and 
his loss has left a huge chasm that we can never fill.

'James will never be forgotten and always in our hearts and thoughts.'

Capt
Townley’s death comes after 38-year-old Sergeant Jonathan Kups, of the 
Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, (Reme) died on Friday at Camp
Bastion.

The MoD said the death of Sgt Kups, 
who was from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was also not thought to be the 
result of hostile action, but that an investigation into the 
circumstances was continuing.

Capt
Townley, who was born in Tunbridge Wells and grew up near Glastonbury, 
in Somerset, leaves parents Peter and Jacqui, his brother Nick, and 
girlfriend Helen.

Described as an avid sportsman who 
enjoyed a wide variety of sports including skiing, mountain biking, kite
surfing, sailing and rowing, he was  due to have turned 30 years old on Saturday.

He was deployed to Afghanistan on September 5 with 4 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment and was based in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand Province as the battle group engineer supporting 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment.

Upon arrival, he immediately immersed himself in operations that directly supported the transition to Afghan-led security, providing specialist advice on engineer tasks and capabilities, the MoD said, and quickly established himself as a 'professional and charismatic' officer.

The MoD added that during his time with 28 Engineer Regiment he 'shone' as an intelligent, experienced and highly competent individual who had great plans for the future.

'With unrivalled commitment to his soldiers, he combined consummate professionalism and ability with a personable, humorous and approachable character,' it said in a statement.

'Extremely popular with his fellow officers, Captain Townley lived life to the full and was at the heart of the regiment both professionally and socially.

'Above everything else, he will be 
remembered for his selfless commitment to every undertaking, his 
strength of character and his faultless integrity.'

Lieutenant
Colonel Jack Nicholson, commanding officer, 21 Engineer Regiment, said:
'Captain James Townley was an enthusiastic, professional and extremely 
likeable young officer who made friends easily.

Capt Townley's family described him as their 'guardian angel' and 'hero'

'Back in Afghanistan for his third tour, he had worked hard to prepare for the deployment and was looking forward to getting to grips with the challenges that lay ahead.

'In the time that I have known him, he was always cheerful, polite and full of energy - a real pleasure to command.

'His tragic loss has stunned the regiment, and we are all trying to come to terms with this awful event. He had many friends throughout the corps and his loss will be deeply felt by all those who had the privilege of serving alongside him.

'Our heartfelt condolences are with his parents Peter and Jacqui, his brother Nick and girlfriend Helen.

'I cannot begin to imagine the pain they are feeling, but the thoughts and prayers of the whole Regiment are with them at this most difficult time.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also paid tribute to Capt Townley. 'I understand that he was an immensely talented and intelligent officer with a flourishing military career who was dedicated to supporting those around him.

'My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.'

The deaths of Capt Townley and Sgt Kups bring the total number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 432.
