The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry gave the opening stage of the 101st Tour de France a royal send-off from Harewood House on Saturday morning.

The peloton rode north out of Leeds in a neutralised procession before lining up once again for the official start of the stage to Harrogate.

Saturday's 190.5km stage will take the riders through the Yorkshire Dales before they loop back and head south into Harrogate, where Mark Cavendish was hoping to take the leader's yellow jersey for the first time in his career - in his mother's home town.
