A Ryanair flight carrying 148 passengers made an emergency landing at Majorca airport today after a light indicated that there was a problem with the undercarriage.

The plane had taken-off from the Mediterranean holiday island's busy Son Sant Joan airport nearly 30 minutes earlier at 6.43am local time to fly to Memmingen in Germany.Â 

However, the pilot reported at 7.20am 
that he was returning to make an emergency landing after a warning light 
went off in the aircraft's landing gear.

The light indicated a possible technical issue with the landing gear bay on the exterior of the aircraft.

Emergency services were activated at Son Sant Joan in case a fire on board prevented the aircraft from making a safe landing, Spanish news agency Europa Press reported.

None of the passengers required medical attention for inhalation of fumes or anxiety.

The airport was placed on full alert and the aircraft landed without incident.
