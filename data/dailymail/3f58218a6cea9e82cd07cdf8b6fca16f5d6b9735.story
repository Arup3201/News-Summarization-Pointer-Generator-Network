Amateur genealogists are spoilt for choice when it comes to researching their family history online, and now the latest tool at their disposal is their DNA.

Three years after launching in the US, family history site Ancestry has extended its AncestryDNA service - a home testing kit that unlocks the secrets of a person’s genetic ethnicity - to the UK.

It is part of a rising trend for these kits, but Ancestry’s service sets itself apart because results can be cross-checked with millions of family trees to help people discover unknown relatives.

Ancestry has launched its AncestryDNA service in the UK. It is the latest in home testing kits that unlock the secrets of a person’s genetic ethnicity. It follows a rising trend in home testing kits, but Ancestry’s service sets itself apart from others because results can be cross-checked with family trees (process pictured)

Since it was released in 2012, AncestryDNA has been used by around 700,000 people.

All of these results have been stored on a secure, encrypted database, and each set of results is linked to a person’s individual Ancestry account and subsequent family tree.

The test uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, which looks at person’s entire genome at more than 700,000 locations via a sample of saliva.

Analysis of the DNA data provides a prediction of the locations of ancestors from 26 separate populations including Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, Scandinavia, Asia and South and North Africa.

AncestryDNA can also help people identify relationships with unknown relatives through a list of possible DNA member matches (example pictured). These results can then be combined with Ancestry’s existing database of 15 billion records and 60 million family trees to trace more lineages

In contrast to Y-chromosome or mitochondrial DNA tests, which only test one line of a person's family and provides information about ancestry several thousand years ago, the AncestryDNA autosomal test targets the last few hundred or thousand years.

This makes it easier for people to learn more about their more immediate family history.

And, as more people buy the kits, the more results will be added to the database.

Another service that offers DNA testing is Britain’s DNA.

It offers a range of options, including tests that look purely at a person’s fatherline, or surname line.

The site also offers tests that traces a person’s motherline along every known mitochondrial DNA branch, consisting of more than 3,000 markers

Mitochondrial DNA is a smaller than the Y chromosome, containing fewer letters, so these markers account for all known mtDNA lineages.

Elsewhere, the All my Ancestry test uses more than 250,000 autosomal markers to discover a person’s recent ancestral mix.

It can reveal if someone has a Native American ancestry, or how far a genome spreads across Europe.

It compares the data to a set of reference samples of known ancestry, including 4,000 individuals from 200 populations from all over the world.

This test shows which population a person is closest to, genetically, and what proportions of their ancestry are from each of seven continental level groups.

Other tests include discovering the genetics of a person’s eye colour, and whether a person carries a red-head variant gene – even if they don’t have red hair. 

Catherine Ball, vice president, genomics and bioinformatics at Ancestry, said: ‘While family history research is most often focused on discovering more about the past, the AncestryDNA test uses the best modern technology to help users find out more than ever before about who they are and where they came from.

‘When used in conjunction with existing Ancestry services, it also provides an exciting opportunity to discover and connect with new relatives - in fact the vast majority of customers from the UK and Ireland can expect to connect with 3rd or 4th cousins in the US immediately.

The tests cost £99 ($99), plus shipping, and results take up to eight weeks to be delivered.

FamilyDNA is an American-based site that offers a similar service to Ancestry. It currently has a database of 711,925 records, at the time of writing.
