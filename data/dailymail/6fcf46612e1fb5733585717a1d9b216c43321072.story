The problem for Brendan Rodgers no longer concerns what happened in Madrid on Tuesday but is about what may happen at Anfield on Saturday.

As the rumpus continues after that team selection for Liverpool’s biggest European away date since 2009, Rodgers has plunged himself into an invidious position: he has to deliver now against Chelsea.

Rodgers did not hatch his plan for the Bernabeu on a whim. He knew it would spark discussion but never could he have expected it on this scale. Fans, former players and even UEFA boss Michel Platini have had something to say. Much of it has been scathing.

For all that Liverpool looked more organised against Real Madrid, for all that the team worked tirelessly and tried to frustrate the home side, they lost 1-0. Having placed such an emphasis on the showdown with Chelsea, Rodgers cannot afford a similar result.

Steve Nicol, a European Cup winner with Liverpool in 1984, said: ‘Who is agreeing with what Rodgers is saying? Liverpool have won the European Cup five times. To go anywhere, lose 1-0 and stick a reserve team out is not on.

‘He said it was a superb performance. The man of the match was (Simon) Mignolet, the keeper, so you couldn’t have been doing that well defensively if your keeper was getting shot at all the time.

‘In the second half, Real Madrid almost fell asleep. So I’m thinking, “Go on Brendan. Get Balotelli on. Get someone else on and see if we can nick something”. And what was there? One shot on target. I mean, come on. We are talking about Liverpool here, not some second-rate team happy to lose 1-0.’

Others from Liverpool’s glorious past joined in. John Toshack, a former Real Madrid manager, wondered why Rodgers was worrying about getting into next season’s Champions League when their hopes in this year’s competition are in jeopardy.

‘Liverpool are going through a dodgy spell and it looked like a damage-limitation job,’ said Toshack. ‘When you start a game and pass back to the midfielder, to the defender, to the goalkeeper, who kicks it straight out of play, something is not as it should be. If Liverpool had nicked a goal, Madrid would have got another one.

Gerrard (centre) had spoke of his excitement to face Real after the Champions League draw was made, but had to settle for a place in the starting line-up... will he start against Chelsea on Saturday?

‘There is a hangover from what happened at Crystal Palace last season [when Liverpool blew a 3-0 lead to wreck their title bid]. That was a bitter pill to swallow.

‘Liverpool need to get some silverware on the table pretty quickly. I’ve seen situations like that [at Crystal Palace] before and they can hang around for a while.’

That point is key. The selection in Madrid can be debated for ever, because there are those such as Ronnie Whelan - another European Cup winner - who point out Rodgers’ best XI were demolished 3-0 by Madrid at Anfield.

But the fact Rodgers gave Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Mario Balotelli a night off in Madrid suggests he is on a revenge mission for the 2-0 defeat Chelsea inflicted on April 27.

Gerrard will be on a revenge mission after his slip against Chelsea last season. Was Rodgers saving him for that when he left him on the bench in Madrid?

That was the day Liverpool’s title dream truly died. Rodgers said on Monday the Premier League was Liverpool’s priority. Traditionalists who have grown up on the triumphs in Rome (twice), London, Paris and Istanbul may baulk but that is how the manager sees it.

‘You sometimes can’t win with a squad rotation policy but that is the only way to go,’ argued Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen. ‘With the added demands we have, that is definitely going to get us results over the course of the season.’

Looking ahead to Chelsea, he added: ‘Sometimes you feel you almost owe them one. It was a big disappointment when they came and took three points off us, so it is a case of wanting to pay them back a bit. But you can’t focus too much on last season.’

Perhaps, subconsciously, they are. This week has been framed for a grandstand finish against Jose Mourinho and Co. There is no room for error.

John W. Henry, Liverpool’s principal owner, is in Dubai for a series of a meetings aimed at securing new business partnerships for the club. The American watched Al Wasl’s match on Wednesday night alongside former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry.
