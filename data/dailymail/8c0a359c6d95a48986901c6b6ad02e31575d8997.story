'One day at a time': Charla Nash spoke candidly about how she is rebuilding her life after her face transplant. She was mauled and almost killed by a friend's chimpanzee three years ago

A woman who had a face transplant after she was badly disfigured and blinded by a rampaging chimpanzee said that she would like to be able to see her own reflection. 

Charla Nash, a 58-year-old single mother from Stamford, Connecticut, almost died after the mauling three years ago.

Her friend's pet, a 14-year-old male ape, tore off her hands, nose, lips and eyelids and left her blind.

Speaking at a rehabilitation center outside Boston, she said she focuses on one day at a time and is glad to have survived.

Ms Nash told WABC this week: 'I wouldn't mind seeing what I look like.'

In
an emotional and candid interview, she revealed that she had been attacked by Travis the chimp before the near-fatal attack took place.

Ms Nash had avoided the 
200-pound creature after it ripped hair from the back of her head.

The single mother also revealed that she thought the relationship that her friend Sandra Herrold had with the primate was incredibly strange. Ms Herrold died in 2010.

Ms Nash said Travis ate well and was allowed to drink wine by Ms Herrold, who treated the chimp like a 'companion'. The primate also allegedly slept in the bed with its owner which Ms Nash said was 'bizarre'.

She had been helping Ms Herrold lure her pet 
chimp Travis inside when the 200-pound animal ripped off her face.

On a harrowing 911 call, Ms Herrold can be heard screaming that the chimp was 'eating her'.  The animal was later shot and killed by police.

At
the time, Ms Herrold speculated the pet was trying to protect her and 
didn't recognise Ms Nash because she had changed her hairstyle.

Slow recovery: Ms Nash, 58, is undergoing intensive rehabilitation at a specialist facility outside Boston and hopes to have a hand transplant in the next few years

Survivor: Charla Nash, a single mother, is accompanied by reporter Sarah Wallace. She was blinded and lost her hands after the chimp attacked her in Stamford, Connecticut

Six months ago, Ms Nash underwent a 20-hour operation which left her with a new face, prosthetic eyes and new hands.

A team of more than 30 surgeons, 
nurses and anaesthetists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, led 
by Dr Bohdan Pomanhac, painstakingly rebuilt her face.

They took a donor's skin, underlying muscle, nerves and upper palate and transplanted the whole face on to Ms Nash's skull.

Although a serious infection meant the 
hands had to be removed, she can now smell again, eat solid food – and 
says her new face ’has really given me a life back'.

Ms Nash had previously told the Today show: 'Of the family who donated the face of 
their loved one, she said: ‘Words can’t even say enough. It’s really 
given me a life back. It’s such a wonderful thing. I cannot thank them 
enough.'

Horrific injuries: Charla Nash hid her face under a veil after the attack, in which the chimp ripped off her nose, eyelids and lips

Near death: Ms Nash before the attack three years ago. She was nearly killed when her friend's 200lb chimpanzee turned on her

Ms
Nash’s 20-year-old daughter Brianna, a college student, added: ‘I’m still waiting for some of the 
underlying bone structure to take some shape on her cheeks – but it’s my
mom.’

Ms Nash had previously described her disappointment
on finding out that her hands had been removed after contracting 
pneumonia, which affected her circulation.

'I
was disappointed that I had them and they're gone again,' she said. 
'But I'm hoping for in the future, that it can be done again.'

Healing will continue over the next year, and Ms Nash hopes she will be given new hands so she can get a seeing eye dog.

She had hidden her face under a veil 
for two years, but bravely revealed the disfigured features in an 
interview with Oprah Winfrey just a few months after the attack.

At
the time she said: 'I wear (the veil) so I don't scare people. 
Sometimes other people might insult you, so I figure maybe it's easier 
if I just walk around covered up.'

Precision: They placed the donor's face on Ms Nash and connected each nerve, muscle and blood vessel

Ms
Herold died of an aneurysm last year. Ms Nash's family are suing her 
estate for $50million and the state for $150million, saying
officials failed to prevent the attack.

In 2003, Travis had to be captured by police after he got loose and was spotted running through the streets of downtown Stamford, Connecticut.

The compensation would help the 58-year-old to pay for her extensive medical and rehabilitation bills and also cover the cost of her long-term care.

Ms Nash and her family will find out in the next few weeks whether her lawsuit will be allowed to proceed through the courts.

The double transplant was the first of 
its kind in the U.S., and has only been performed once before in the 
world, in France.

It was paid for by the Department of Defense, through a
contract it gave Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2009 to cover the cost
of face transplants for veterans and some civilians, hospital officials
said.
