Complications: Lauren Yardley had surgery to go from an A to a DD cup

Lauren Yardley had always dreamed of having a more curvaceous figure.

So at 25, and tired of her ‘boyish’ shape, she decided to buy what Mother Nature had not given her.

She paid almost £4,000 for a breast implant operation, increasing her A-cup size breasts to DD.

But to her horror, just two months after the surgery, her body started to reject one of the implants.

Weeks later, it actually started protruding from her chest and came through the skin.

Now the nursery worker wants to warn women of the potential pitfalls of cosmetic surgery.

‘I couldn’t believe it when the implant started coming out of my breast,’ she recalled.

‘At first it was like a blister, but then over the next week it started to come out more and more.

‘I did not feel too much pain, just discomfort.

The doctors at the 
hospital said they had never seen anything like it – they couldn’t 
believe I was not in septic shock.

I feel very lucky, it could have 
been a lot worse.’

Miss Yardley, from Coventry, paid £3,750 at a private clinic for breast
 implants in September 2009.

Soon after the surgery,  her right breast 
became hard  and lumpy.

Doctors diagnosed capsular contracture, a common complication in implant
 surgery, in which the body forms a capsule of scar tissue around the 
implant.

Unhappy: Lauren decided to have surgery because she was  she hated her flat chest and was 'fed-up of looking like a boy'

But her body rejected one of the implants and began removing it through the weakened tissue of the scar

It is a natural process and usually settles. In Miss Yardley’s 
case, however, the scar tissue tightened around the implant so much that
 it started squeezing it out of her body.

She paid another £850 for surgeons to replace the implant.

But two months later she was rushed to A&E at Coventry University 
Hospital when the implant started protruding from her breast.

 After 
checks, she was transferred  back to the Tonic Cosmetic Surgery clinic 
in Nottingham where surgeons safely removed the rejected implant.

Then came the worst part of her ordeal. She had to wait seven months for
 her body to heal, with one breast totally flat and the other still DD 
before doctors could replace the implant again. She also had to pay 
another £1,000.

‘The most horrific thing was having only one breast for seven months,’ 
she said.

‘I was booked to go on holiday to Tenerife for two weeks so I 
had to pad out my bra so people would not notice.

When I booked the 
operation they told me it was common for the body to reject implants – 
but I had no idea this could happen. 

‘People always ask me if I would have implants again after all I have 
been through but I always say yes. I don’t regret it at all.

But it has 
cost me a fortune to have all the follow-up operations.’

A spokesman for Tonic Cosmetic Surgery said: ‘Most women who have breast
 implants will experience some level of capsular contracture. Lauren’s 
is probably one of the worst cases we have seen.’

Capsular contracture, an unavoidable 
complication of breast implant surgery, affects most patients to some 
degree. If it occurs, it is likely further surgery will be needed.

The body creates a capsule of fibrous scar issue about the breast implant as part of the healing process.

This is a natural reaction that occurs when any foreign object is surgically implanted into the body.

The scar tissue over time will begin to shrink at a rate and extent which varies from person to person.

In
 some cases, such as Lauren's, the capsule can tighten and squeeze the 
implant, making the breast feel hard or even eject itself from the body.
