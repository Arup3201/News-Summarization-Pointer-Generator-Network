NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams had pitched to NBC and CBS about making him the next late-night show host before he was busted for falsifying stories. 

Williams, 55, is currently suspended from NBC without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. 

But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk.

And few years ago, Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. 

Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. 

Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons, according to New York Magazine.  

Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested, sources told New York Magazine. 

Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness.

Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another.

Williams sent Turness a note over the holidays that read, '2015 is going to be our year together', according to New York Magazine.  

He went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal, during the same dinner Turness presented him with Murrow's old writing desk. 

She had found the 1940s desk through a Los Angeles-based antique dealer.  

And less than two months later, Williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation.

This comes just after speculations that Katie Couric might be is in talks NBC's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing Williams on the Nightly News.

'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source told the New York Daily News. 

Lack 'has not made up his mind' as to whether or not Williams will return when his six-month suspension is up, according to New York Magazine's sources. 

A 'close friend' of Williams said the the magazine, however, that the anchor 'can't wait until he can speak', which he can't do publicly until his suspension ends.
