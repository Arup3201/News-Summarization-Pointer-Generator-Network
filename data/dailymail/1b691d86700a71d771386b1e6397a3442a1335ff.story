John Lewis customers were in revolt last night after the retail chain dumped free cake and tea for loyalty scheme members.

Up to a million customers are to be stripped of the highly popular perk - introduced as a reward for allowing the high street giant to track their shopping habits - from next month.

The My John Lewis loyalty scheme launched in October last year with free monthly vouchers for a pot of tea or coffee and a cake worth £5 in the store’s restaurants for those who signed up.

Disappointment: The chain has announced the monthly perk will depend on how frequently they visit the store

But the chain disappointed customers yesterday when it announced the monthly perk will be restricted immediately for new loyalty scheme members - and for existing members from next month.

Instead customers will receive tea and coffee vouchers based on how much they spend in John Lewis - and how frequently they visit the store as well as their ‘preferences and purchases’.

The news comes after Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, was forced to issue a profit warning earlier this month, partly because of the popularity of its own loyalty scheme.

Shoppers with a myWaitrose card – which was introduced in 2011 – receive a free tea or coffee daily, including cappuccinos, lattes and mochas, even if they do not buy anything else. 

They also receive a free copy of most daily quality newspapers if they spend more than £5.

The gimmick has proved hugely popular and the supermarket is estimated to hand out one million free cups of coffee and nearly one million newspapers every week.

The change at John Lewis means some of the scheme’s one million members will now receive vouchers only occasionally or not at all. The loyalty card will still have other perks such as discounts and invites to events and entry to a prize draw.

A spokesman for John Lewis said it was restricting the offer because its restaurants become ‘extremely busy in the run-up to the peak Christmas season’.

He said: ‘We want to make sure our customers experience the high standards of service they expect from us during this period.

Reason? A spokesman for the loyalty card said the restaurant gets too busy in the run-up to Christmas

‘All My John Lewis member rewards are continually reviewed and the rewards our members receive in future do depend on a variety of factors including shopping frequency, spend, preferences and purchases.’

Loyal customers who had agreed to let the firm track their habits solely because of the monthly treat were angered at the decision.

Guy Anker, managing editor at consumer champion website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ‘There will be many disappointed loyal John Lewis customers – especially existing loyalty card holders. Our site users have told us they feel let down that the offer’s been changed.

‘People are really feeling the pinch and in the run up to Christmas they more likely to have popped into the store for a free cuppa and slice of cake.’

A John Lewis spokesman refused to be drawn on whether its move to cut back on free drinks was down to cost.

But free coffees and cakes in big chains have begun to attract wider criticism.

Campaigners have argued such schemes force smaller shops out of business, while some traditional shoppers worry that free drinks attract the ‘wrong type’ of customer.
