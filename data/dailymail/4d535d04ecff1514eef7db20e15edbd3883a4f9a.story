A year after 17-year-old Kyle Coleman mysteriously vanished after a hunting trip with a friend in outback Queensland his family are no closer to finding out what happened to him.

The baffling case was made even more tragic by the suicide of the Mount Isa teen's best mate days after they returned from the expedition on February 22 last year.

It's believed the pair went hunting near Undilla Station at Camooweal, west of Mount Isa. One day later, Kyle's friend told police he last saw him when he left his Soldiers Hill house to walk the three kilometres to his own home in the early hours of February 22.

But Kyle never arrived and hasn't been seen since. Four days later, on February 26, Kyle's friend took his own life.

Police say there's no evidence suggesting 21-year-old's death is in anyway linked.

Kyle's disappearance sparked a massive search spanning thousands of kilometres around the cattle station and Mount Isa but to no avail.

Mount Isa Inspector Trevor Kidd says detectives have exhausted all options and the case has been handed to the coroner.

'His disappearance has had an enormous impact on the community,' he said on Saturday, almost one year after Kyle was reported missing.

'Not only was Kyle well known but his friend was well known too. This is a real tragedy for both families involved.'

Insp Kidd said the case had caused enormous angst among Mount Isa residents, many of whom spent weeks helping with the search effort.

He again urged anyone with information about Kyle's disappearance to contact police.

Kyle's mum Sonia Coleman said 2014 had been the most testing year of her life.

'We all spend so much time thinking about Kyle every day, longing to know where he is, how to find him, wanting to give him a respectful resting place to be near his family,' she said in a letter published in the North West Star newspaper.

'This year has damaged us and many others.

'It's still very difficult to understand why Kyle is no longer here with us.'
