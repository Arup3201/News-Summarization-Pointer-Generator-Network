The child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in Rotherham because its inspectors never bothered to look for it, senior officials admitted yesterday.

Inspectors working for the OFSTED regulator were instructed that they should watch out for sex abuse happening inside the children's homes and foster homes where children in council care were living.

But their rules said nothing about looking out for the exploitation of children who were collected from houses, institutions and schools by taxi drivers and assaulted and raped away from their homes by determined gangs of abusers.

Not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from OFSTED, former executives of the organisation told MPs.

Admission: OFSTED's former chiefs said the child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in Rotherham because its inspectors never looked for it

The guidelines that steered OFSTED's inspectors away from the ruthless exploitation of up to 2,000 children and girls by organised Pakistani gangs in the Yorkshire town were revealed to MPs of the Commons Communities and Local Government Committee by two of its former chiefs.

Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: 'The public thinks OFSTED ticks boxes. It doesn't get in to what is really happening in an authority.'

The regulator's former Deputy Chief Inspector John Goldup made the admission and apologised for the watchdog's failures a week after the devastating report on the Rotherham scandal by Government adviser Louise Casey.

She found the town's council obscured and suppressed evidence of large-scale sex exploitation, trafficking and rape over a 16-year period, partly because councillors and staff feared being accused of racism.

While the gangs were grooming and violently attacking the town's children by the hundred, OFSTED repeatedly rated the councils' social work record as 'adequate' and published a report which said the way it cared for children was improving.

Mr Goldup told MPs that the 'framework' within which inspectors examined the council's work was not designed to deal with child sexual exploitation, which he defined as exploitation outside a home.

'The framework focussed on child sex abuse, which mainly happens in children's homes,' he said.

'That framework, I would now look back and and say, was very strongly focussed on effective outcomes on abuse and neglect on children in the home. Why did it not have a focus on child sexual exploitation? I have reflected on that as you can imagine.'

The framework was known as Safeguarding Looked After Children, or SLAC for short, Mr Goldup said. One MP commented: 'Slack may be the appropriate word.'

Mr Goldup added: 'I think that our understanding of child sexual exploitation - and I'm not just talking about Ofsted but a national understanding - up to that time was that it was an evil that had surfaced in a small number of very specific places and very specific circumstances.

Accountable: Not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from OFSTED, former executives of the organisation told MPs

'We didn't understand the scale and prevalence and scope of child sexual exploitation until 2012. I don't think we understood that it almost certainly affects thousands of children all around the country and it could be happening in any local authority.

'By the end of 2012 we were inspecting for child sexual exploitation in a very different way. We needed to improve. We needed to learn. We didn't get it right at the time we inspected Rotherham.'

However Michael Hart, OFSTED director of children in 2007 and 2008, told the MPs that inspectors did know about child sexual exploitation outside the home. 'This wasn't a new concept,' he said. 'Of course it was known about.'

He said OFSTED had referred to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham in a report published as early as 2006.

Mr Goldup said: 'I don't think inspection is perfect. I don't think inspection can ever be perfect.'

He added that he agreed with OFSTED's chief Sir Michael Wilshaw 'that we didn't get it right with child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. He apologised for that and I apologise for that.

'The inspection frameworks at the time didn't have the focus on child sexual exploitation that they would and should have had if we had known and understood then what we know and understand now.

'It is clear from reading back over the inspection reports that we didn't appreciate the scale of the child sexual exploitation issue in Rotherham and we didn't scrutinise sufficiently the effectiveness with which it was being responded to.'

Mr Goldup and Mr Hart both told MPs that they had sacked no-one at OFSTED over the failure.

They said if inspectors were found to have failed in their job, inspection reports could be rewritten and republished. But the public would not be told about lapses by inspectors.
