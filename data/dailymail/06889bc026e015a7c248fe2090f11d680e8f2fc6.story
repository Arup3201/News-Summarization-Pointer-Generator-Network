He flew in porn stars from California, held courtside seats at Miami Heat baseball games and lived in a beautiful $2.4 million condo by the beach.

But the fun times ended for South Florida trader Cliff Popper, 54, when the credit crunch hit and his sub-prime mortgage investments collapsed.

He killed himself this week under the weight of claims he misled 1,000 people into putting money into investments that lost them $100million.

‘It was a horror show,’ lawyer Scott Silver told the Miami Herald. ‘People lost homes, retirements, life savings. He lived a rockstar lifestyle.’

Popper found himself on trial last November over the sub-prime mortgage-backed securities that collapsed when the housing market crashed.

He drove a $128,000 BMW Z8, the model from 1999 James Bond film The World is Not Enough, and had a box at the Miami Dolphins NFL stadium.

Popper also owned a $2.4million condominium on South Beach, Florida, and spent thousands of dollars a week on escort services and porn stars.

He spend his time slicing smaller units of bundled mortgage-backed securities to sell to retail customers, reported the Miami Herald.

More than $300million was invested while Popper and the team he worked with took commissions of more than $16million over three years.

But it all fell down in 2007 when the sub-prime market went down. Some investors had borrowed up to 90 per cent of their investments.

The company he worked for, Brookstreet Investors, went down that year and Popper had his brokering licence revoked, reported the Miami Herald.

In 2009 he was charged with civil fraud and filed for bankruptcy. He was on trial but a judge has not yet ruled on his case. He protested his innocence.

'His personal life and his professional life were destroyed. But I had no idea he was going to (commit suicide)'

Jeffrey Kaplan

His former lawyer Jeffrey Kaplan said Popper's 'personal and professional life were destroyed' but he had 'no idea' his ex-client was going to kill himself.

Popper’s body was found at his third-story condo in Highland Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, reported the Miami Herald.

‘There are people who saved $500,000 for their retirement,’ Mr Silver, who has knowledge of the case, told the Miami Herald. ‘They can’t retire.’
