An ex-member of Warren Jeffs' polygamist cult has opened up about how she thanked her father for molesting her, because it made her the woman she is today.

Flora Jessop, one of the stars of TLC's reality TV show 'Escaping the Prophet,' ran away from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Colorado City when she was 16 and now works to help rescue other victimized children.

'A few years ago I walked up to my dad and thanked him for molesting me,' Jessop, 43, said this week.

'I didn't thank him because I enjoyed it. I thanked him because I look back on everything I've been through, and I decided that I was going to wrap it around me and embrace every memory, every act, all of it, and build myself out of those ashes.'

Break away: Flora Jessop, 43, left the Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - 'one of the most dangerous polygamist cults in America' - at 16. She is the star of new TLC series Escaping the Prophet

She added in the interview with Huffington Post: 'Because I figure, everything I've gone through has enabled me to understand the children I fight for everyday.'

Her father didn't respond and when she sees him now, while visiting her nieces and nephews, he immediately leaves the room.

Brandon Jeffs, Warren Jeffs' nephew, also stars in the reality show and spoke out about the molestation he suffered at the hands of his uncle when he was just five. Years of painful physical and emotional abuse followed, he said.

He said he first started to question the ways of the church at age 12 when he went to the grocery store with one of his mothers and was helped by a clerk named Nancy. He said he realized she was not a devil, as the cult claimed people in the outside world were. She also made him realize that women were equals not inferior to men.

Brandon Jeffs, who was being groomed to be a 'god' and take up the leadership reigns from his older male relatives, managed to flee at age 15.

Jessop said she knew she was different from the other girls within the cult from an early age.

'You're raised inside the FLDS as a girl to believe your responsibility is to have one baby per year to build your husband's kingdom because he is going to be a god,' she explained.

'All of my sisters would sit around an talk about how they wanted to have 30 babies and I swore I was never having more than two children because in my child mind I could grab one under each arm and run.

'If I had three babies I would have to stand there and take the abuse they dolled out and I wasn't willing to jeopardize my children.'

Interestingly, despite the abuse she 
suffered at the hands of her father, she said she didn't come out of the
 experience despising men.

'I
 went through the sexual abuse by my father all of that but I didn't 
come out of this hating men, I came out it hating women and it took me 
16 years to trust my first female after leaving the cult,' Jessop told 
Huffington Post.

She said this was because the men - the gods - leave the house because they can't stand the sound of babies crying.

'The women are the enforcers. When you take all these women and you place them together and they share one man... the brutality on each other and each other's children is insanity. So you learn to hate women.'

She said she did the TV show because she wanted to spread the word of the atrocities she faced and hundreds of children continue to face daily.

'I wanted this show to come out because I wanted to reach victims everywhere,' she said.

In TLC's series Escaping the Prophet, she works with law enforcement and inside informants to assist runaways as they cut ties with the cult led by the infamous Jeffs - 'a world of unquestioned authority, arranged marriage, and little contact to the outside world.'

The series, which will be in six one-hour parts, sees her helping different members as they face the possible dangers of leaving the cult, such as being shunned by their families and pursued by leaders of the cult.
