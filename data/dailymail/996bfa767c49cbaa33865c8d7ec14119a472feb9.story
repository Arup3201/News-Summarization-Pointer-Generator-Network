Karren Brady today boasted of having the ‘last laugh’ after triumphing over sexist men in business.

The football boss and Apprentice star was unveiled as the Conservative’s new business tsar, fuelling speculation she will launch a political career.

Speaking at the Tory conference in Manchester, the West Ham vice-chairman spoke of the difficulties of being the first woman ‘to break into a very male dominated industry’ – including being asked what her ‘vital statistics’ were.

New role: Karren Brady, pictured with David Cameron and the Conservative Party Conference today, has been named as the party's new business tsar fuelling speculation she's interested in getting involved in politics

Speaker: Ms Brady, West Ham vice-chairman spoke of the 
difficulties of being the first woman ‘to break into a very male 
dominated industry’ – including being asked what her ‘vital statistics’ 
were

The 44-year-old, who has spoken of her
desire to ‘get involved’ in running the country, was chosen to 
introduce the Chancellor’s keynote conference speech.

She
gave her backing to the coalition, insisting: 'It is this government 
that understands that without small businesses, Britain would not be 
what it is today.’

She hailed Chancellor George Osborne 
as 'the right man with the right plan' and launched an attack on Labour 
who she said 'all but bankrupted the country'.

'David Cameron and George Osborne held their nerve and stuck 
to the plan and I hope you can see how right they were - we are now 
starting to recover, we are turning a corner.'

Leader: The decision to become an ambassador for the Tory party will fuel speculation about her political ambitions

In touch: The businesswoman wore a £38 dress from BHS and pearls which belonged to her gradnmother

She
introduced herself to delegates saying: ‘I’m Karren Brady. I’m a 
businesswoman, business owner, company director and mother of two.

‘A few of you may also know me as the woman who raises my eyebrows a lot in the background on the TV Programme The Apprentice.’

But she went on to reveal the difficulties she faced as a 23-year-old woman when two decades ago she took charge of Birmingham City football club.

Business: The new Tory tsar said she understood the sacrifices people have to make when they start out

‘My football career started in 1993 when I saw an advert in the Financial Times newspaper, that said “football club for sale”’, she said.

‘I phoned up and got the details and went to my chairman at the time and said there is this football club for sale in Birmingham why don’t we buy it and I’ll run it.

‘”Football”? He said. “Very male dominated. You’ll have to be twice as good as the men to be thought of as only half as good”.

‘Luckily. That’s not difficult!  I replied. That was on the Friday and on the Monday we owned a football club.’

At her first press conference with 200 journalists she was ‘desperate to look at least 25 so I had big hair, big shoulder pads and gave a serious presentation of all these things I was going to do with this football club now I was the CEO’.

But when she finished her ‘very serious presentation’ she asked for questions.

‘A little hand went up. “Yes sir” I asked. He said: “What are your vital statistics?”

 She said the episode made her more determined to succeed.

‘I had the last laugh. I made a trading profit in my first year in charge for the first time in the clubs modern history.

‘I floated my business on the stock market in 1998, making me the youngest CEO of a PLC in the country and when I sold the business in 2009, 75 per cent of the senior management team running the business were women.’

She said the Tories back her ambition to help more women into business, hailing small firms as the ‘lifeblood of the British economy’.

Struggle: Miss Brady revealed the sexism she faced when as a 23-year-old she became Managing Director of Birmingham City in 1993

Fame: Karren Brady joked that she is probably best known as the woman from The Apprentice who raises her eyebrows in the background

She went on: ‘Many of you are entrepreneurs and are sitting here today. I want to say to you that I know the sacrifice you make - the 60 hour weeks, juggling family life and staying awake late at night worrying about how you are going to pay the next wage bill, where you will get your next loan to grow your business, when are you going to take on your next employee.

‘I know when you start out that you are the FD, the sales director, the receptionist and the tea maker, it can be lonely.

‘But it is this government that understands that without small businesses, Britain would not be what it is today.

‘Which is why I have agreed to be The Conservative Party’s small business ambassador.

‘I promise I will do all I can to help, promote and listen to the people who don’t always have a voice and I know how vital it is that the Government supports business wherever and whenever it can.'
