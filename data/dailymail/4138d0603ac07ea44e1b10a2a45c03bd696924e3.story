Investigated: There are now 300 child abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile

Jimmy's Savile's youngest victim was just eight years old, it has emerged after she came forward to sue the late DJ's £4.3million estate.

She says he molested her at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, in Buckinghamshire, while she was recovering after an operation in 1986.

Her shocking revelation comes as a man also scarred by the paedophile's legacy admitted he is haunted by the possibility he may be Savile's love child.

The sick BBC star, who has now been exposed as one of the UK's most prolific abusers, had a fling with Mr Biven's mother when she was a teenager.

Liz Dux, from law firm Slater & Gordon, said of the eight-year-old victim: 'This was a little girl who went in for treatment and came out an abuse victim. She should have been protected.'

Savile was free to roam Stoke 
Mandeville in Buckinghamshire as he pleased, using his position as a 
charitable donor to sexually abuse sick children.

He
kept toys donated for children in his private flat in the hospital 
grounds, and was accused of attacking vulnerable young children on the 
wards - with nurses advising them to 'pretend to be asleep' when he was 
visiting.

Solicitors have confirmed that they are planning to take legal action on behalf of 43 alleged victims, including a man and woman who were nine when they were attacked by Savile at the BBC.

Slater & Gordon, which is acting for 36 people who were aged from eight to 23 when they were abused, has sent letters before action to the BBC, Leeds General Infirmary, Stoke Mandeville and Broadmoor hospitals, and the executors of Savile’s estate.

Another law firm, Pannone, is acting on behalf of seven alleged victims and has sent letters of claim to Savile’s estate. One claim has also been made against the BBC.

There are currently 29 current and 
former BBC staff under investigation for alleged sexual 
misconduct - three times the number originally thought.

Police are investigating 300 child abuse allegations against the DJ, who died in Leeds aged 84 a year ago.

Builder Craig Bivens, 52, revealed in The Sun today how he is worried the BBC star could have fathered him during a five-month affair with his mother, Liz Boothe.

'I don't want to be the boy of a kiddie fiddler,' he said. 'I don't want to be his son.'

Ms
Boothe, now 70, found she was pregnant after a relationship with Savile
when she was 18 and he was managing the Mecca Locarno dancehall in 
Leeds.

The former model and singer now believes she was cherry-picked for Savile by a bouncer.

She and the bouncer went out for a drink and he stole a photo of her from her bag to show to his boss.

She
was then taken to Savile's office at the Mecca and told by the DJ: 
'Right, you don't see him any more. I want to take you out.'

Ms Boothe added: 'It was always wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Being quick was the only good thing about him.

'Let's
be honest, I only went out with someone looking like he did because of 
the people I could meet... the most famous was Cliff Richard.'

Ms
Boothe, who is 'disgusted' to think that such a sick figure could be 
the father of her child, described Savile as 'mean and arrogant.'

A Tory councillor has called for Jimmy Savile’s corpse to be exhumed and cremated after complaints from people who have loved ones buried nearby in the cemetery.

Colin Haddington spoke out as his civic colleagues voted unanimously to strike Savile’s name from Scarborough Council’s roll of honour and posthumously revoke his freedom of the Borough once the police investigation is over.

Council leaders said there was no point in investigating the idea of an exhumation of the reviled entertainer because the decision on his final resting place is a matter for his family and the church authorities rather than the town hall.

Savile is currently entombed in concrete in the resort’s Woodlands Cemetery, where he was buried at a 45 degree angle a year ago so he could 'see the sea'.

His £4,000 triple headstone - with the final epitaph 'It was good while it lasted' - was removed and broken up for landfill at the request of the family.

Councillor Haddington said: 'I have been contacted by one of my constituents whose granddaughter is buried close to Savile.

'This has caused her enormous concern and the family a great deal of distress. My constituent has asked me to put her family at ease - if the body could be exhumed, taken a short distance to the crematorium, and cremated.

'I would ask the council leader if he would in conjunction with the legal department look into this to see if it is possible.'

Council leader Tom Fox described Savile’s behaviour as 'grotesque and obscene' but argued that it was not the council’s place to decide what happened to Savile’s remains, which was a matter for the family.

He said: 'There was media speculation that the family may consider an exhumation. The family then said it was not part of their considerations.

'But it did prompt the council to consider how an exhumation could be done.

'Savile is interred in consecrated ground. If he is exhumed and put in another consecrated area the church diocese will need to give permission and consent given to where he goes.

'The grave owner then needs to give permission and the local authority is then last in line to give its permission.'

Similar consent would be needed even if Savile was reinterred in non-consecrated ground, he added. There are also the options of cremation and disposing of the remains at sea.

She
said: 'He'd take me to restaurants with his entourage and stuff his 
face with fast food. But he'd say to the waitresses, "A coffee for the 
lady." I spent most of the time with him starving.'

She
did see a darker side to his lifestyle, however, and claims Savile 
regularly met with police and gangsters and even ordered an arson attack
on heavyweight boxer Bruce Woodcock.

'He wasn't a nice person,' she added - although she said she never knew of any paedophilia.

After she broke up with Savile, she was called to his office, where he asked if she was really pregnant and if the baby was his.

She did not want it to be, she said, so she told him that it was not. He replied: 'Thank god for that.'

Father-of-two Mr Biven, who looks remarkably like Savile, now has to live with the knowledge that a predatory paedophile could be his father.

Mr Biven has only blank space on his birth certificate where his father's name should be, but he and his mother never want to know the truth.

'It's best left,' said Ms Boothe. 'I'm sure there are loads who had babies by Sav.'

Savile’s name is to be wiped from Scarborough’s list of Freemen of the Borough as a gesture of support to his 300 alleged victims, who he is said to have abused over six decades.

The disgraced BBC star was awarded the accolade in 2005 to celebrate his links with the North Yorkshire resort, where he owned a second home and was buried overlooking the sea a year ago.

Councillor Tom Fox, who proposed the motion, said: 'This council wishes to send its heartfelt support to, and acknowledge the courage of, those who have come forward having suffered horrendous abuse at the hands of the alleged serial predatory sexual offender Sir Jimmy Savile.'

The Savile scandal began when ITV broadcast new sex abuse allegations in a documentary about the late presenter on October 3, sparking a mammoth police inquiry.

Intense scrutiny of the BBC followed, after the corporation dropped a Newsnight report into the presenter’s actions last year after his death.

Comedian Freddie Starr and former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, have also been questioned by officers investigating the abuse scandal.

Doctors at Leeds Infirmary as well as Stoke Mandeville at the time are accused of collaborating in Savile's rape of children.

Others claim they were abused by Savile while pupils at Duncroft Approved School in Surrey during the 1970s.

Savile's estate has been frozen in response to the allegations.

NatWest Bank, which is acting as his executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims.

Savile was also a regular visitor to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital and befriended Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, now 66.

Britain’s top expert on serial killers said police should probe whether the pair developed a friendship before Sutcliffe was caught.
