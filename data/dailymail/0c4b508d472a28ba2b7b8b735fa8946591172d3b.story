The International Space Station (ISS) was forced to dodge a deadly field of space junk last week after debris came within 1,000 feet (0.3km) of its orbit.

On Thursday, the Expedition 39 astronauts raised the altitude of the ISS by half a mile (0.8km) to prevent a Gravity-style disaster.

Nasa said the astronauts fired 53 thrusters at on the ISS’ Zvezda Service Module for three minutes, 40 seconds to complete the manoeuvre.

This was enough to prevent the space station from colliding with parts of an old Ariane 5 rocket which was launched by the European Space Station.

This is the second time in less than three weeks that the ISS has had to sidestep space junk.

Nasa spokesman Kelly Humphries said the space agency has had to consider sidestepping space junk dozens of times since the outpost was launched in 1998, sometimes cancelling the orbital dodge at the last moment.

Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites.

It is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph.

One major source of debris in the past was the testing of anti-satellite weapons carried out by both the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s.

Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia.

More recently, the GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year.

The station also moved on March 16 this year to avoid an old Russian weather satellite part.

And the problem is only set to get work. Last year, Nasa said the amount of space junk orbiting Earth has reached a tipping point.

This junk – which can include anything from old rockets, abandoned satellites to missile shrapnel - will soon make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet, the space agency claims.

There are currently around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites.

Overall, it is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, travelling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph.

As well as this, there are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they can’t be tracked.

Even tiny paint flecks can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these velocities.

A number of space shuttle windows have had to be replaced because of damage caused by material that was analysed and shown to be paint flecks.

‘The greatest risk to space missions comes from non-trackable debris,’ said Nicholas Johnson, Nasa chief scientist for orbital debris.

Since the space age began 54 years ago, civilisation has littered the area just above Earth's atmosphere with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches, as well as old satellites.

Many pieces of space junk fall back down to Earth, but most burn up on re-entry.

Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In February 2007 for instance, a Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia.

The booster had been carrying an Arabsat-4A communication satellite but malfunctioned before it could use all of its propellant creating a cloud of space debris.

More recently, the GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, made a fiery fall to Earth in November last year.

Its debris fell along a path through East Asia and the Western Pacific to Antarctica but no one was hurt.

Several solutions to retrieving or moving the space junk have been put forward including giant cosmic versions of harpoons, nets, tethers, magnets and even a giant dish or umbrella-shaped device.

Mission Control also has the option of taking additional precautions, such as closing hatches between some of the station’s modules, if the likelihood of a collision is great enough.
