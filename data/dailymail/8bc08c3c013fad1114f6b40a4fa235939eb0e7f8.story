On camera: The CCTV footage of the woman

Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday apparently showing Michaella McCollum Connolly taking 11kg of cocaine to her hotel was last night being examined by prosecutors.

Wearing a long black skirt and with her black hair tied up, the woman in the CCTV footage is walking back from a pizza parlour carrying a large bag.

The footage was recorded on CCTV on August 5 at midday – the time Michaella and Melissa Reid told police in Peru they were forced to collect the drugs.

The Mail on Sunday obtained the footage from a street camera run by the city’s neighbourhood watch service. Miraflores District Neighbourhood Watch supplied two days’ worth of recordings to our reporter. We scoured it for evidence to back the women’s story. The footage we examined was taken outside the three-star hotel where the girls were staying.

The Colonial San Agustin hotel is in the Miraflores district of Lima which is popular with tourists.

In their police interview last week, the women said that they were called on a Blackberry phone given to them by men in Ibiza and told to go to the pizza parlour next to the hotel.

Papa John’s pizza parlour is about 200 yards from the hotel on the opposite side of the street. The women said that Michaella had met a man outside the restaurant who gave her a bag and that she returned to the hotel with it. In the footage a woman is seen calmly walking past the restaurant and then the camera pans away towards the hotel. 

In the next shot she is seen walking quite quickly along the pavement and across a pedestrian crossing and towards the hotel.

After this newspaper handed the footage to the city’s prosecutors yesterday they said it could form an important part of their case.

A source said: ‘This video could prove to be hugely important in the girls’ case.

‘We will examine it carefully and try to track the movements of the figures who are keeping an eye on the girls as they load up the taxi.’

Police have already seized CCTV footage from the Colonial San Agustin hotel.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country

But it appears they overlooked the video shot from the street camera outside the hotel.

A police source said: ‘It’s extremely likely that is the footage of the British womanpicking up the cocaine.’

A source for Lima airport’s antinarcotics unit said the skirt worn by the woman in the video is identical to one worn by Michaella when arrested.

Melissa, from Lenzie, Glasgow, claims she first met Michaella, from Northern Ireland, in one of the gangsters’ dingy hideaways in Palma, Majorca.

They were kept captive in a flat, she said, then flown to Lima separately.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
