A disabled Chinese boy has been tied up by his family for six years after they struggled to cope with his 'aggressive' behaviour.

Xie Guobiao, 11, who suffers from a learning disorder, was first held captive in 2008 after he became a 'nuisance' in his hometown in Songyang County in China's Zhegijang province.

His parents tied a rope around his chest, before attaching it to a wooden pole in their home.

Shocking: Xie, who suffers from a learning disorder, was first held captive in 2008 after he became a nuisance in his hometown. His parents tied a rope around his chest, before attaching it to a wooden pole in their house

For the past six years, they have kept him tied to the pole - and only allow him out of the house if he is attached to his 'rope lead'.

Now, police are investigating claims of child cruelty against Xie's family after discovering the youngster tied up at the property.

But astonishingly, officers have claimed the boy is clearly loved by his parents - and that the best option may be to actually keep him roped up.

Before being held captive, Xie was nicknamed 'monkey boy' by locals in Daohui village because of his ability to scamper up trees and walls with ease.

Kept under control: For the past six years, Xie's family have kept him tied to the pole - and only allow him out of the house for walks on his 'rope lead'. Above, Xie is pictured with his 68-year-old grandfather, Xie Juntu

He was blamed him for broken tiles and stolen fruit in the village, among other acts of vandalism and theft.Â 

His mother, Huang Baoxiu, said: 'Xie suffered from a lack of oxygen to 
the brain at birth. This slowed down his development and made him 
aggressive around others.

'He was always slipping out of the house 
and getting into mischief. His father and I had no choice but to tie him
 down.'

His father, Xie Xianli, 41, added: 'I 
was having to work more and more each day just to pay off the debts 
caused by his vandalism.

'Nuisance': Before being held captive, Xie was nicknamed 'monkey boy' by locals in Daohui village because of his ability to scamper up trees and walls with ease. Above, the youngster is pictured on the roof of his home

Tragic: The young boy was blamed him for broken tiles and stolen fruit in the village, among other criminal acts

On a walk: Xie's mother, Huang Baoxiu, said her husband and she had had 'no choice' but to tie their son up

'Now, I leave it to my father to tie him up every day before I go to work.'

Xie's grandfather, Xie Juntu, said he tied the youngster to the pole every morning - but took him out for walks on his 'rope lead' later in the day.

'We tried medical cures but nothing worked,' added the 68-year-old. 'We are being cruel to be kind.'
