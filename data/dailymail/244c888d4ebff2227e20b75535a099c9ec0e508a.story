It’s the TV Baftas this Sunday and to celebrate ahead of the star-spangled event Bafta have lifted the lid on all the glitz, glamour and excess of the occasion.

In a series of Bafta Style infographics the sheer scale of styling required to primp and prep our TV actors for a ceremony is revealed in all its gory detail, as well as evidence of just how much our most well-known stars like to party.

Jaw-dropping figures include a staggering 6,732 glasses of champagne guzzled by small screen stars at Bafta events.

From a fashion point of view, things were smart for the men: Fashion data shows that 48 dapper gentlemen opted for a classic bow tie at the event, while some opted for quirkier 
choices such as lime green glasses.

Alex Jones won Bafta over in a bright yellow dress while dishy funnyman Darren Boyd sports a bow tie

Amy Childs wore a fitted turquoise dress and modelled false eyelashes, lashings of hairspray and grips

Others show hair stylist to the stars 
Mark Hill got through 2,000 hair grips while TV actors had their hair 
styled for a total 66 hours.

Amy Childs, who wore a fitted turquoise dress, was a fine example of false eyelashes, lashings of hairspray and hair grips put to good use at last year's TV Baftas.

Statistics reveal that if every gown worn were laid in a line 
they’d circle the Royal Festival Hall seven times over, and most vibrant
gown went to Alex Jones, who wore canary yellow along with Zoe Hardman.
