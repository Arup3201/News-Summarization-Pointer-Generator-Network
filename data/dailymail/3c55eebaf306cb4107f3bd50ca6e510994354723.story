A man in China was left in agony for six hours after he trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit trying to retrieve his new mobile phone.

Chen Ho was using the public lavatories in the city of Jianyang in Sichuan province and talking to a friend when the device slipped out of his hand and down the toilet.

Connected to a deep cesspit, Chen rolled up his sleeves and fished around for the smartphone before his arm got stuck - sparking a six hour rescue operation.

Wedged in: The man trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit after dropping his mobile phone while he was talking to a friend

He said: 'Unfortunately, my hand and arm became wedged in all this muck.

'The smell was appalling and by the time firemen arrived my arm was terribly swollen. I forgot I had a cut on my hand and I think it got infected.

'It was most embarrassing.

'When firemen arrived they used a towel to wrap my arm up as best they could and and then dug up the tiles around the toilet to broaden the space to try to lever it out.

'It went on forever but about six hours after I sat on the loo I was free.'

Firemen were called in after Chen Ho discovered his arm was wedged in the toilet. They had to chip away at the tiles surrounding the toilet to set him free

By the time rescuers had arrived Chen Ho's arm was swollen and it took six hours for him to be freed

He said at first he had not wanted to call for help as he was embarrassed at his situation.

His smartphone was new, he said, and added: 'I couldn't bear the thought of not having it. But getting it back did me no good - the thing was ruined.'

A fire brigade spokesman said: 'You wouldn't believe the call outs we have in this district for possessions that have gone missing down the white bowl - phones, false teeth, even a Swiss army knife, although what that was doing in the toilet I have no idea.

'At least those people did the right thing by calling the professionals. We do not recommend DIY retrievals.'
