It is a lesson drummed into many of us as children, cheating simply does not pay. 

And for one deceptive pub landlord the consequences of breaking that golden rule turned out to be painful when he was ordered to run 10k holding a giant pumpkin he had bought but pretended he grew himself.

Paul Koffman, 42, was desperate to win the vegetable growing competition he runs in his home town of Flintshire in Wales.

But he suffered a setback when his pumpkins failed to grow so he decided to buy one instead, and pretend it was home-grown. 

Paul Koffman, 42, claims he was left covered in bruises after he was forced to run 10k with his offending fake pumpkin entry

However his fellow green-fingered competitors spotted the deception and decided to enforce their own version of punishment.

The father-of two-was made to run more than six miles carrying the offending 14lb pumpkin throughout the streets of Flintshire for the town's 10k run.

Not only was he left ashamed, but he claims the run left him battered and bruised. 

'It was horrific carrying a 14-and-a-half pound pumpkin,' he said. 

'Every eight steps or so I had to change the pumpkin’s position.

Mr Koffman faked his pumpkin entry into the vegetable growing competition he runs every year in Flintshire 

The offending fake home-grown pumpkin was left discarded at the end of the 10k race 

'I’m covered in bruises - it was absolutely horrendous.

'My shoulders and arms are really painful.' 

Mr Koffman organises the annual giant vegetable growing competition at his pub the Cross Keys at Llanfynydd, near Mold, North Wales. This year's challenge was to grow the largest pumpkin. 

About 360 runners took part in the 10k run. Mr Koffman came first in his age category and raised more than £100 for Nightingale House hospice.

Laura Parry, the hospice’s area fundraising manager, said they were “absolutely thrilled” with Paul’s support.
