A group of bungling gang members who intended to kidnap a prosecutor actually nabbed her father after getting the wrong address, authorities have revealed.

Frank Janssen, 63, vanished from his Wake County, North Carolina home last month but was found safe in an Atlanta apartment block several days later. Before an FBI team rescued him, his kidnappers sent his wife messages threatening to dismember him if their demands were not met.

A federal indictment released on Tuesday
 reveals the team's repeatedly botched efforts, including an earlier 
trip to the wrong address and how they left a receipt at the scene 
showing where they had stopped for a snack ahead of the alleged 
kidnapping.

The crew had been contracted to kidnap his daughter, Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen, on behalf of a high-ranking gang member - Kelvin Melton - that she had put in prison for life.

Melton, a 49-year-old Bloods member, was named in the indictment for allegedly calling the shots from his prison cell with a smuggled cell phone. Eight others are named in the indictment.

Janssen's
 daughter, Wake Forest assistant district attorney Colleen Janssen, 
prosecuted Melton in 2012 for his role in the shooting of his 
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.

Court
 records show Melton has a long record of felony convictions in New 
York, the first being a 1979 robbery committed when he was 14. He 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery in 1998 and served more than 
13 years in New York prisons before being released in August 2011.

'Ring leader': Kelvin Melton allegedly called the shots from prison using a smuggled cell phone

His conviction in North Carolina sent him to prison for life. Authorities said he wanted revenge.

In March, he hired the group to track down Colleen Janssen - but the first effort to kidnap her took them to Louisiana, miles from her North Carolina home.

After using an internet search, the armed group allegedly rented a car and drove to Louisiana - but they aborted the plot for reasons not listed in the indictment.

In late March or early April, Melton called again to kidnap Janssen.

One
 of the team members used the Internet to look up Colleen Janssen's 
address but actually found her father's home in Wake Forest, about 15 
miles north of Raleigh.

Early
 on April 5, four of the kidnappers left the Atlanta area for North 
Carolina. Melton called them several times while they were on the road, 
at one point asking to be put on speaker phone to give them specific 
instructions.

He told them to wear khakis and collared shirts, so they stopped at a Wal-Mart to buy clothes.

When
 they got to Janssen's home, three of the kidnappers went to the door 
while another waited in the car, according to the indictment. When Frank
 Janssen cracked the door, the kidnappers forced their way in, hit him 
with a stun gun several times and pistol-whipped him.

According
 to prosecutors, the group left behind a receipt from a meal stop they 
made earlier that day, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Authorities
 have revealed text messages sent by the alleged gang members to the 
kidnap victim's wife, as well as details of a call between the gang and 
their mastermind, Kelvin Melton.

Texts from the 'gang' to Christie Janssen

If you contact police, 'we will send (Mr. 
Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take 
someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we 
will do drive by and gun down anybody.'

At 12.19am Wednesday, she 
received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair.

'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my 
things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.'

Call between 'gang' and 'mastermind'

At
 8.20pm on Wednesday, Melton called the kidnappers and they apparently spoke about where to bury Janssen's body:

'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.'

'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.'

'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.'

'However you feel like doing it, just do it.'

'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.'

It led investigators to a McDonaldâ€™s restaurant in Lexington, South Carolina, where surveillance video helped identify two of the suspects, authorities said.

After the kidnapping, the team drove back to Atlanta and handcuffed Janssen was forced to lie on the floorboard of the back seat of the car. They used the stun gun on him dozens of times.

The indictment doesn't say what happened when Melton discovered they kidnapped Janssen's father instead of the prosecutor, but two days after he was taken, Janssen's wife started receiving the threatening text messages.

Each one seemed to grow more urgent. On April 9, Janssen's wife received a photo of him tied up in a chair along with a message: 'Tomorrow we call you again an (sic) if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.'

The indictment said that while Janssen was in the Atlanta apartment, he was taped to a chair in a closet, and some of the kidnappers stood watch.

Melton sent instructions to one member to assist in the killing and disposal of Janssen if Melton's demands weren't met or if the team lost contact with Melton for three days. The specific demands have not been released by authorities.

Around 8 p.m. April 9, Melton received a text saying, 'We got car, spot, and shovel.'

A few minutes later, Melton called the kidnappers and told them to kill Janssen and gave specific instructions not to leave any DNA behind, court documents said.

By that night, authorities had 
determined Melton had orchestrated the scheme and was still calling the 
shots behind bars. When corrections officers tried entering his cell, he
 smashed the phone.

Authorities pinpointed Janssen's location through the use of the team's cell phone signals and stormed the apartment just before midnight April 9.

A short while later, three of the nine people charged were caught in a Chevy Tahoe that had two shovels, a pick and a gun inside.

Melton was indicted along with Quantavious Thompson, Jakym Tibbs, Tianna Maynard, Clifton Roberts, Jenna Martin, Jevante Price, Michael Gooden and Patricia Kramer.

All face a federal conspiracy charge related to the abduction, and all but Kramer are charged with kidnapping. Some of the defendants face additional charges. All but Kramer were in custody Tuesday.
