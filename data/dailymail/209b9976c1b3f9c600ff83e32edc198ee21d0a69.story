A man in China has been sentenced to six years in prison for 'provoking trouble' because he grew a beard.

The 38-year-old from the Uighur minority received several warnings before attending court in Kashgar, local newspapers reported.

His wife was also given a two-year sentence for wearing a veil that hid her face.

In China authorities widely discourage growing a beard because they say it is linked to extremist ideals. The Uighurs vehemently dispute this claim.

The unnamed man started growing facial hair in 2010 before being accused of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble' by officials.

A campaign dubbed 'Project Beauty' similarly encourages women to leave their heads bare and abandon wearing the veil - a relatively widespread practice among the Uighurs.

Speaking after the court case officials  said: 'Since the beginning of the year, a certain number of people breaking the regulation on beards, veils and burqa have been prosecuted and sentenced.'

The repression of the Uighurs has been fanning tensions in the region for more than a year.

In 2013 Chinese authorities flooded into the region after a wave of unrest caused tension between the Uighurs and the Han Chinese, the majority ethnic group

Violence increased last year and at least 200 people were killed in a series of bombings and deadly clashes with security forces.

In April authorities in Xinjiang's Shaya county offered cash to informants to report on neighbours with excessive facial hair.

And in August authorities in Karamay city banned people with large beards or Islamic clothing from travelling on public buses.

The origins of the Uighur tribe lie deep in the Altai mountains of Mongolia - or in Turkmenistan, depending on which version of the story you believe.

According to the Uighurs, their origins are Turkic and date back more than 5,000 years. They now reside in the Xinjiang region. 

By contrast, the Chinese say the Uighurs are descendants of the Tiele tribes of Mongolia, who by 842, had coalesced into the Uighur people and moved to the Tarim Basin in what is now modern China.

Either way, the debate around the origins of the Uighurs is yet another skirmish in the ongoing battle between the majority-Muslim tribe and the Han Chinese, the country's majority ethnic group.

Mainly tolerated during the long rule of the Chinese emperors, the real problems for the Uighurs began in 1949.

After a failed bid for independence, the Chinese cracked down on the fledgling state.

Activists accuse the Chinese government of steadily eroding the minority's freedoms, as they have curtailed religion, commercial and cultural activities. 

Beijing has also been accused of seeking to dilute Uighur influence by arranging the mass immigration of Han Chinese to Xinjiang.

According to China, their activities are justified because of the terrorist threat posed by Uighur separatists. The Uighur themselves vehemently dispute this claim.
