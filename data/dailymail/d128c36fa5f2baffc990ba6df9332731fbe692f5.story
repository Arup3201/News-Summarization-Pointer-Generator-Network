Whistleblower: Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee at the National Security Agency claims he tried to complain 10 times to his superiors

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden claims that he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programs but no one listened to him.

According to testimony given to the European Parliament released on Friday the former NSA contractor claims that as a contractor, rather than a government worker, he was not protected from raising concerns and decided to take matters into his own hands.

Instead of benefiting from Obama's Presidential Policy Directive 19, under which federal employees can question classified programs, Snowden felt that 'individuals like me were left with no proper channels.'

'As an employee of a private company rather than a direct employee of the U.S. government, I was not protected by U.S. whistle-blower laws, and I would not have been protected from retaliation and legal sanction for revealing classified information about lawbreaking in accordance with the recommended process,' Snowden said in his testimony according to the Washington Post.

Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton.

It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia.

In his testimopny Snowden claimed that he was warned that his concerns were dangerous for his career and that he should keep his head down and maintain a low profile.

'The first were well-meaning but hushed warnings not to 'rock the boat,' for fear of the sort of retaliation that befell former NSA whistle-blowers like Wiebe, Binney, and Drake,' he said, according to the Post, before adding that the other responses were suggestions that he, 'let the issue be someone else's problem.'

Snowden said that the culture of silence at the NSA was all-pervasive.

Snowden testified, 'there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.'

The NSA disputes this account, telling The Washington Post that, 'after extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden’s contention that he brought these matters to anyone’s attention.'

'Everyone in the intelligence community is aware of what happens to people who report concerns about unlawful but authorized operations,' he wrote.

In the past, Snowden has mentioned that he tried to take four of his superiors to task over the spying program.

'I asked these people, ‘What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?' he said.

'How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?'

Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA.

'Even among the most senior individuals to whom I reported my concerns,” he continued, “no one at N.S.A. could ever recall an instance where an official complaint had resulted in an unlawful program being ended, but there was a unanimous desire to avoid being associated with such a complaint in any form.'

The Justice Department has charged Mr. Snowden with violating the Espionage Act and the fugitiver reiterated his claim that he has taken no documents with his to Russia.

'I didn’t take any documents with me from Hong Kong, and while I’m sure they were disappointed, it doesn’t take long for an intelligence service to realize when they’re out of luck,' he said.

'I would also add, for the record, that the United States government has repeatedly acknowledged that there is no evidence at all of any relationship between myself and the Russian intelligence service,' Mr. Snowden said.
