This the adorable moment an NBA basketball player and a special needs child shared an enthusiastic chat and a high-five after a game.

Marc Gasol of the Memphis Grizzlies was heading back to the locker room after the team beat the New Orleans Pelicans 110-74 on Wednesday night.

That's when he stopped to quickly chat with a young fan on the sidelines, who animatedly talked and pointed to Gasol before they exchanged a high five. 

This is the adorable moment Memphis Grizzlies player Marc Gasol and a special needs boy shared a quick chat and a high-five after a game 

Gasol was walking back to the locker room after his team won when he stopped to talk with a very enthusiastic young fan on the sidelines

As Gasol walked away the delighted boy clutched his Grizzlies jacket to his chest as the biggest smile spread across his face. 

The young child is a devoted Grizzlies fan and popular with the players. 

Last year forward player Zach Randolph left the bench during the fourth quarter of a game to spend a minute with the boy, who was trying to get his attention from the audience, according to the Bleacher Report. 

When Randolph realized the boy wanted the warm-up shirt he was wearing, he stripped it off without hesitation and gave it to the fan before shooting him a thumbs up after he returned to his seat.
