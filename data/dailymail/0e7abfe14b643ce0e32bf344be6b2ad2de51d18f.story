Nathan Dyer feels focusing on high-flying Swansea is the key to fulfilling his England dream.

The in-form Dyer scored twice in the 3-0 home victory over West Brom on Saturday which briefly took Swansea to the top of the Barclays Premier League before Chelsea won 6-3 at Everton.

The previous week Dyer scored the winner against Burnley and some pundits felt the 26-year-old was unfortunate to not make Roy Hodgson’s England squad for next week’s friendly against Norway and the opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on September 8.

Recognition: The English winger is hoping his good form will lead t an international call-up

Hodgson’s wide options include Andros Townsend and James Milner even though neither player has started a Premier League game this season, and Swansea boss Garry Monk said on Saturday that his two wingers, Dyer and Wayne Routledge, could count themselves unlucky not to make the England squad on current form.

But Dyer says all he can do to win an England call-up is is keep on performing well for a Swansea side who have won their opening three games and will head to Chelsea after the international break full of confidence.

“Obviously it would be an honour to play for England and any player would love to play for their country,” Dyer said.

“I’m one of them but I’ve got no say what happens and all I can do is keep playing well and keep improving for Swansea.

“I’m really enjoying my football at the moment, but I’m going to keep my head down and keep playing for Swansea.”

Swansea made light work of West Brom at the Liberty Stadium side as the Welsh club secured their best start to a campaign for 91 years.

But Dyer insists Swansea can get even better after taking nine points from nine.

“I feel there’s more improvement to come,” Dyer said.

“The balance of our team when we’re attacking can’t be too complacent, but we created opportunities with our movement and we’ve got to take that into the next game.”

Alan Irvine is still seeking his first league win as West Brom manager and will use the forthcoming international break to get his new recruits up to speed as quickly as possible.

West Brom had a huge turnover of players during the summer and Irvine says the new signings are still in the process of getting to know each other.

“We’ve got a group of lads who are ready and a group of lads who need some work,” said Irvine.

“Some of them will be doing a mini pre-season next week with a view to being closer to being available the following week.

“It’s been a big ask for the boys who have come in lately and some of them were on the pitch at Swansea, but we’ve got to get through that.”

West Brom completed the signing of 26-year-old Argentine winger Sebastien Blanco from Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv on Saturday afternoon and Irvine said that will be the last piece of Albion transfer business before the window closes on Monday night.

“We’re done now, the work has been done - the positions we targeted at the start have now been filled,” said Irvine.

“That will be our squad going forward and we will give the players time to settle in.

“That’s difficult during a Premier League campaign but we don’t have any other choice, and I don’t expect any to go out.”
