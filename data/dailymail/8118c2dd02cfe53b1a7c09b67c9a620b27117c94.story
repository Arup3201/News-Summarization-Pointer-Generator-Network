McDonald's is blaming the ‘severe winter weather’ after announcing a 1.7 percent drop in customer traffic in the United States during the first quarter of 2014.

The Oak Brook, Illinois-based fast food giant attributed the drop in the flagship U.S. market to ‘challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather’, while global sales fared only slightly better and edged up 0.5 percent.

The world's biggest hamburger chain is however predicting that global sales for April will be modestly positive. 

McDonald's is blaming the 'severe winter weather' after announcing a 1.7 percent drop in customer traffic in its flagship U.S. market during the first quarter of 2014.

April is the first full month that Taco Bell has offered its national breakfast menu, which it has pitched to challenge McDonald's dominance in the morning.

The decline in sales and customer traffic in the U.S. reflects the increasing struggle McDonald's is facing as eating habits change and competition intensifies.

After a decade of growth, annual sales at established U.S. locations fell for the first time last year.

The continued decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 is in stark contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which last week said sales at established locations rose 13.4 percent.

The fast-food restaurant chain posted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.21 on revenues of $6.7 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported EPS of $1.26 on revenues of $6.61 billion

McDonald's CEO Don Thompson has noted in the past that there is a split appearing in the fast-food industry, with people who have more spending money heading off to chains that charge more.

He said McDonald's will focus on underscoring value for its more cash-strapped customers, but the chain is also offering more premium offerings such as its new Bacon Clubhouse Burger.

In a statement on Tuesday, Thompson said McDonald's is focusing ‘creating the best overall experience for our customers.’

To adapt to shifting trends, for instance, the chain has been rolling out new prep tables in its U.S. kitchens that can hold more sauces and toppings.

The idea is to eventually offer greater customization on its menu while keeping orders easy to assemble for workers.

Speed and accuracy have been an issue for McDonald's as it stepped up the pace of new menu items in the past year.

In Europe, McDonald's said sales rose 1.4 percent at established locations in the latest quarter. The figure rose 0.8 percent in the unit that encompasses Asia, the Middle East and Africa, despite a decline in traffic.

For the quarter ended March 31, net income fell to $1.2 billion, or $1.21 per share. Analysts expected $1.24 per share.

A year ago, the company earned $1.27 billion, or $1.26 per share. McDonald's Corp. noted that the year-ago results were boosted by income tax benefits.

Revenue edged up to $6.7 billion, but was shy of the $6.71 billion Wall Street expected.

Shares of McDonald's edged up 83 cents to $100.50 in pre-market trading.
