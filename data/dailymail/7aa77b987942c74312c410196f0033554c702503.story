One little girl proved that claw carnival games are not impossible when one thinks outside the box by literally climbing inside.

A little girl from Fort Lauderdale was able to climb into the claw machine and gain access to a pile of stuffed animals which she handed out to all who desired to claim a prize.

Imgur user Palmbchgirl snapped a photo of the young pioneer and posted it online with the caption 'I took this photo myself when I saw it happening today.'

Stealing? A little girl crawled into the claw machine to hand out stuffed animals free of charge

As soon as the image was posted, both Reddit and The Daily Dot posted stories that sparked a bit of controversy.

Some Reddit users believe that the little girl's parents are at fault for allowing their daughter to take from the game without paying.

Other Redditors take on a more 'stick it to The Man' mentality and praise the girl for her actions.

'Pretty sure that little girl can beat that claw in a fight,' said Reddit user wiljones.

'That claw has taken millions dollars from good people. That little girl is justifying all the wrong that claw committed,' said KHDTX13.

'Like a modern day Robin Hood,' said TheNotoriusReposter.

Other users were less thrilled with the girl's attempt at claiming an unlimited number of prizes.

'I was starting to think I was the only one to realize this is stealing,' said Totemusprime.

'And grownups ask her to steal for them. wow,' said stigatle.

'First thing I thought of. Adults are in there pointing at stuff for her to steal for them? Really? Go buy a stupid stuffed bear if you want one. Or don't get one if you can't afford it. You don't steal it,' said Kangareagle.

The Daily Dot noted that whether or not people think the child is stealing matters less than the child's safety.

This little girl came away from the fun un-clawed, though letting children dive into heavy machinery probably isn't the wisest plan.
