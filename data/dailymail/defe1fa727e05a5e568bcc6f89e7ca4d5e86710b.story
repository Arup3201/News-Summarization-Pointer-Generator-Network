Chris Denning has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Saville scandal

A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Chris Denning, 72, was detained on Monday at a hostel in East London by officers working on Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree.

Police said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences.

But today it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’.

It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague.

Denning famously posed for a picture with a host of famous DJs for the launch of Radio 1 and Radio 2 in 1967.

Among those alongside him were Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel.

After leaving Radio 1, Denning helped launched the career of Gary Glitter and later moved overseas.

In recent times, he has been staying at a hostel for the homeless in East London, which the Mail is not identifying for legal reasons.

There was no sign of him there on Tuesday or yesterday, but sources confirmed he had been a resident there.

Scotland Yard said Denning, the 13th man to be detained by Yewtree, was arrested on Monday afternoon. He was later bailed to return pending further inquiries on a date in July.

Last month the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s.

Detectives, are probing claims the 59-year-old comedian committed a sex offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War.

The attack is alleged to have happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British troops.

Davidson, 59, was originally arrested in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies all the allegations.

Other arrested celebrities include, entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Gary Glitter has also been detained. They also deny any wrongdoing.

PR guru Max Clifford has charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations “a load of nonsense”.

Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt.

But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate. At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks.
