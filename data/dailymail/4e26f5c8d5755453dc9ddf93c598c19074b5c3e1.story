The San Francisco Chronicle is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term 'Redskins' when it refers to Washington's National Football League team.

Managing Editor Audrey Cooper announced on Wednesday that the newspaper's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial slurs.

'"Redskin" is a patently racist term,' Ms Cole said.

Name change: The San Francisco Chronicle will now refer to the Red Skins as the Washingtons

The Chronicle joins several other publications that have made the same decision, including the Portland Oregonian, the Kansas City Star and Slate.com.

In recent months, local leaders in Washington and some members of Congress have also called for a name change, and some media outlets have stopped using the name.

It is also the subject of a long-running legal challenge from a group of American Indians seeking to void the team's federal trademark protection.

Redskins' owner Dan Snyder has said that the original Boston Redskins had a Native American coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to Washington.

But Suzan Shown Harjo, a major figure in the trademark case before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was unimpressed with the reference which she described as part of the team's 'time-dishonored history of putting up pseudo-Indians as part of their promotion.'

Ms Harjo also rebuffed an assertion by Mr Snyder that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage.

'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said in an email to The Associated Press. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.'

The debate about whether the term is an epithet has raged for decades. The Chronicle says it revisited the issue last month at the request of Scott Ostler, one of its sports columnists.

The paper also recently ran an editorial by Caillie Millner, in which she recalled an encounter two American Indian friends of hers had when they watched the Red Skins play about 40 years ago.

The couple 'took their seats, only to be treated like living mascots by Redskins fans. She spoke of being "poked" and having their hair "pawed" by them, "in a scary way",' she wrote in the Chronicle.

Ms Millner added: 'When it's all over, we'll look back with amazement at the fact that a team had a name like that in the nation's capital. We'll look back and realize how shameful and embarrassing it really was.'

When the San Francisco Chronicle refers to the team, it will now call them the 'Washingtons' Ms Cooper said.
