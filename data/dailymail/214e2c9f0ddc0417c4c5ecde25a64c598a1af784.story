Credit to Leandro Damiao for his innovation, but surely this is a new low in the long list of sneaky attempts to con the referee.

The Brazilian striker appeared to pull his OWN shirt during Santos’ 3-0 defeat by Criciuma.

The referee wasn’t duped into falling for it, but the cameras picked it up - leaving Damiao open to widespread ridicule.

Damiao attempted to con the referee into thinking a defender was pulling the shirt in an attempt to win a foul

Damiao was once involved in a long running transfer saga involving a potential move to Tottenham earlier in his career.

Spurs were interested in landing the 2012 London Olympics top scorer as late as last summer, when the player was at Internacional.

But the north London outfit baulked at the Brazilian side's £18million valuation before swooping for Roberto Soldado.
