A U.S. official has confirmed the arrest of a fifth suspect in the Netherlands, in the copyright infringement case against file-sharing website Megaupload.

Thirty-two-year-old software programmer Andrus Nomm, a citizen of Estonia and a resident of both Turkey and Estonia, could become the seventh person charged in the case against the alleged $175million piracy ring.

According to the Justice Department, authorities are seeking the arrest of two remaining men.

Denied: Megaupload boss Kim Dotcom (right) was denied bail during a hearing in Auckland, New Zealand today

News of Nomm's arrest came after a New Zealand judge denied bail today to Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, 38.

Prosecutor Anne Toohey argued at the 
bail hearing, in Auckland, New Zealand, that Dotcom, also known as Kim 
Schmitz, was a flight risk 'at the extreme end of the scale' because it 
was believed he had access to funds, had multiple identities and had a 
history of fleeing criminal charges.     

But his defence lawyer said the former
hacker, who is reportedly 6ft 6in tall and weighs more than 285lbs 
(20st), was hardly likely to escape detection by New Zealand 
immigration.

'He is not the sort of person who will
pass unnoticed through our customs and immigration lines and controls,'
said lawyer, Paul Davison.

He added that his client had cooperated fully, his passports had been seized and his funds frozen.

But Judge David McNaughton in Auckland
denied Dotcom bail pending a hearing on February 22 on his possible 
extradition to face trial in the U.S., agreeing with Ms Toohey that he 
poses a flight risk.

The high life: Dotcom, formerly known as Kim Schmitz and nicknamed 'Dr Evil', was arrested along with three other executives of Megauploads on Friday

The entrepreneur - nicknamed 'Dr Evil -
a German national, appeared to be in high spirits before the hearing, 
smiling and waving to around 20 supporters in court before being denied 
bail.

U.S. authorities want to extradite Dotcom in what they say is one of the biggest criminal copyright theft cases ever brought.

The convicted hacker is accused of 
masterminding a scheme that made more than $175million in a few short 
years and cost copyright holders $500million by copying and distributing music, movies and other copyrighted 
content without authorisation.

Megaupload's lawyer has said the company simply offered online storage.

Judge David McNaughton said the bail 
application was too complicated for an immediate ruling, adding he would
issue a written decision no later than today.         

New Zealand police arrested three 
other Megaupload employees on Friday  after New Zealand police raided 
his £16million country estate at the request of the FBI.

Flamboyant: Neighbor Kevin Crossley said Dotcom cut an imposing figure when he took a lease on the $24million luxury mansion (above) in their sleepy neighborhood of Coatesville, near Auckland

Mansion: Cars and artwork were seized by authorities on request from the FBI from Dotcom's sprawling home

Fleet: Police seized cars carried license plates that read 'MAFIA', 'HACKER', 'STONED', 'V', 'KIM COM', 'CEO' and 'POLICE'

Lavish: Dotcom also had a garish pink Cadillac in his collection of luxury cars, which was also seized by police

The FBI estimates that Dotcom personally made around $115,000 ($121,000, £77,700) a day during 2010 from his empire.

The list of property to be seized, 
includes nearly 20 luxury cars, one of them a pink Cadillac, works of 
art, and NZ$10million ($10.5million, £6.7million) invested in local 
finance companies.      

Police had to cut Dotcom out of a safe
room he had barricaded himself in, because, according to his layer, he 
was frightened and panicked.   

McNaughton is expected to make bail rulings on the three later this week or early next week.

The official who commented on Nomm's arrest spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is still pending.

Authorities in the U.S. are seeking to
extradite the three other men in New Zealand and are also expected to 
seek Nomm's extradition.

Dotcom's case is being heard as the 
debate over online piracy reaches fever pitch in Washington, where 
Congress is trying to craft tougher legislation.            

Lawmakers stopped anti-piracy 
legislation on Friday, postponing a critical vote in a victory for 
Internet companies that staged a mass online protest against the 
fast-moving bills.

The movie and music industries want 
Congress to crack down on Internet piracy and content theft, but major 
Internet companies such as Google and Facebook have complained that 
current drafts of the legislation would lead to censorship.             

Critics of the U.S. Stop Online Piracy
Act, or SOPA, and Protect IP Act (PIPA), quickly showed their 
opposition to the shutdown of Megaupload.com, with hackers attacking the
public websites of the Justice Department, the world's largest music 
company Universal Music, and the two big trade groups that represent the
music and film industries.
