A dog’s owner may not notice how fast their pet is growing, especially if they see them every day.

But one owner from San Francisco didn’t want to miss a week of his Rhodesian Ridgeback’s development so created this lovely time-lapse. 

The 23-second clip shows Greg Coffin’s dog Sophia growing from a two-month old puppy into a fully-grown three-year-old.

The footage was filmed by Greg Coffin from San Francisco. It shows the development of his Rhodesian Ridgeback, Sophia as she grows from two months (pictured) to three years in just 23 seconds. This is then reversed to show Sophia shrinking back to a puppy

The footage was taken by Mr Coffin, a senior art director at Digitas, every weekend, with help from his wife Amanda.

It ends with outtakes that show Mrs Coffin attempting to keep Sophia still during the filming.

Mr Coffin wrote on Facebook: ‘This is a pet project we've been working on for three years, that's finally completed.

'It's been amazing watch our little lady grow from a little burrito to the beautiful beast she is today.’

The fastest growth of a puppy occurs between four and six months.

By the time it’s a year old, a dog's skeleton is usually fully developed, although it may continue to develop in larger breeds for the next six months to a year.

In Mr Coffin's video, Sophia's rear legs are shown getting longer and larger even after this time.  

By three months, a puppy typically has a full set of baby teeth, which are replaced by adult teeth at around five months. It is likely the dog will begin a chewing phase at this point.

Puberty typically begins at around four months old and sexual maturity can hit as early as six months.

Between seven and nine months, a puppy will begin exploring more of their environment, and this can lead to a second chewing phase.

The testosterone level in male puppies increases up to seven times higher than in an adult dog by the time it reaches 10 months, which can cause a growth spurt. This falls to a normal level by 18 months.

Doggy paddle is one of the first strokes children develop when learning to swim, but despite inspiring the name, research has discovered dogs don’t paddle in water at all. Instead, they perform a more complex cycle of movements (pictured) underwater  to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag

Doggy paddle is one of the first strokes children develop when learning to swim, but despite inspiring the name, research has discovered dogs don’t paddle in water at all.

Instead, they perform a more complex cycle of leg movements underwater designed specifically to maximise their speed through the waves and reduce drag. 

Professor Frank Fish from West Chester University used underwater cameras to film eight dogs, across six different breeds, as they swam across a pool,

When a dog trots on land, their front paw rises and falls in time with the hind paw on the opposite side. For example, the left front paw will rise and fall with right hind paw.

However, when a dog runs on land, in order to increase its speed, the legs move in a more complex, cyclical way.

The left hind paw lands first, followed by its left front paw, right hind paw and right front paw in sequence. As the dog runs further, the legs rise in the same pattern.
