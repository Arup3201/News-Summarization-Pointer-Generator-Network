First came proms. Then came baby showers. Now 'Sip and See' parties are set to be the next American cultural import to take the UK by storm.

Designed to show off a new baby to adoring friends and family, the celebration has become increasingly popular over the last 12 months, with event organisers reporting a surge in bookings.

The popularity of the new event mirrors the rise of baby showers, which are now so commonplace that 36 per cent of pregnant users of the website BabyCentre say they plan to have one.

Among those rumoured to have thrown a baby shower is the Duchess of Cambridge, although whether she and Prince William will hold a Sip and See for their eagerly awaited new arrival is yet to be seen.

The rise of the Sip and See party is thought to be down to a combination of social media and the influence of American TV, although the parties thrown by a series of high profile mothers have also given the concept a boost.

Among them is Barbara Bush, daughter of former president George W. Bush, who hosted a soiree for twin sister Jenna and her newborn niece Mila earlier this month.

While many Sip and See parties are nothing more than low key drinks at home, for a growing band of new parents, they're becoming a chance to see and be seen - and are becoming increasingly expensive as a result.

The Taylor Lynn Corporation [TLC], a wedding and event organiser, told the Times newspaper that although it had organised just two parties in 2012, it is throwing eight this year - all costing between £3000 and £7000.

According to TLC, clients have included a senior partner in a Manchester law firm who asked for a Wizard of Oz theme for his Sip and See, which was held in a marquee at his home.

Terry, who didn't want to reveal his surname, said: 'We have always known about the tradition of wetting the baby's head and just thought we would take it a step further.'

Speaking to the Times, his wife Susan added: 'We had life-sized characters and created our own yellow brick road in the marquee.

'We had tables dressed with witches' hats. It cost £8000 but it was worth every penny.'

But not everyone who throws Sip and See parties does it for their offspring's benefit.

According to Laura Caudery of Parallel Venues, whose family own the Fetcham Park venue in Surrey, some couples use the baby bash to try out ideas that they'll later use for their wedding. 'People can have more fun with it,' she explained.
