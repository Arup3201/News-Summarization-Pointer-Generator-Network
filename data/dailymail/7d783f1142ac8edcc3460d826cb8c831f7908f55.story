Nathan Heath, 20, was caught shortly after burgling a house when his victim followed footprints he left in the snow

A serial burglar was caught after posting pictures of his haul on Facebook and by leaving a trail of footprints in snow - leading to where he was hiding.

Nathan Heath, 20, broke into a house in Hull, West Yorkshire, as the homeowner slept before fleeing with the stolen items to a friends house almost a mile away.

When the victim woke up and found his front door ajar he followed the footprints all the way to the house and called police - who found Heath and the stolen goods inside.

A manhunt was launched after Heath failed to appear at Hull Magistrates' Court on January 2, but rather than answer the charges that day, he was instead burgling another house.

He took a Ford Fiesta, two laptops, a television, a games console, a wallet, a purse, jewellery, fishing equipment, a quad bike and cash from the house. 

While on the run, he used his social media accounts to boast about his crimes and claimed he would never be caught.

One account in the name of Nathan Heath Ov NHE (North Hull Estate - a gang) shows him posing with fanned out bank notes and the caption: 'I ripped him off'.

Heath was jailed for three years at Hull Crown Court yesterday, where he admitted to 50 previously unsolved crimes, and stole items worth more than £26,000.  

PC Andy White from Humberside Police, said: 'Nathan Heath is a one-man crime wave. We believe he has been prolific for a very long time.

'Not only was he committing crimes, mainly burglaries, in Hull, but in parts of the East Riding, too.' 

Sergeant Richard West, of the Northern neighbourhood policing team at Humberside Police, said: 'Nathan Heath was prolific in committing crimes across the city.

The serial burglar admitted to police that he committed 35 separate burglaries in four months, totalling more than £26,000 worth of goods

'He was on the run for a month but we knew we would get him and bring him to justice.

'He has been removed from the streets and we hope this makes the city a safer place for residents.'

Hull Crown Court heard how Heath had told officers he committed 35 separate burglaries between September 1, last year, and January 26, this year. 

Many of them were committed while homeowners slept in their beds and none of which have been recovered.

One incident during the early hours of November 17 saw Heath target a family home after an argument the previous day. A man told Heath to stop urinating against a public wall.

The following night, on the same day he was due in court, he snatched house keys through a cat flap, and stole items worth £21,000 - including a Vauxhall Astra, a Volkswagen work van, a mobile phone, a laptop, power tools, a wallet, a purse and cash.

On leaving the property, Heath painted an offensive word across the home's windows.

After the burglary on January 2, the victim took to Facebook to appeal for information about his stolen Ford Fiesta.

Heath used his Facebook page to 'boast' about the items he stole, including dozens of bikes (pictured)

He also posted pictures showing wads of cash (above) on Facebook, writing: 'Pleny more were this came from [sic]'

In doing so, he came across the Facebook page Nathan Heath ov NHE. The cover photograph had been changed to a picture of Heath posing in the victim's stolen car.

Heath's final burglary happened on Tuesday, February 3.

Detective Constable Lee Sims, of the priority crime team in Hull, said: 'Nathan Heath has admitted being responsible for 56 offences. They were taken into account as part of his sentencing.

'By admitting all these offences and the harm he has caused, it is hoped Heath will break his cycle of offending when he leaves prison.

'At the same time, his many victims know he has been brought to justice. With Heath, we used Operation Cleanslate.

'This gives offenders an opportunity to admit offences, many of which the police may be unaware of their involvement in.'
