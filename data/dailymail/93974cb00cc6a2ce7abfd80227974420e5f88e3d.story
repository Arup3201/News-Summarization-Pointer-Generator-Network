A Massachusetts state trooper who was assigned to desk duties after he leaked grisly arrest photos of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has retired from the force.Â 

Tactical photographer Sgt. Sean Murphy 'was absolutely not forced out,' his lawyer, Leonard Kesten, said on Tuesday, adding that the trooper would receive a full pension. '(He is) happy with state police. It was just time.'

The decision came days after internal charges were upheld against Murphy, a 25-year-veteran with the state police. Those charges included unauthorized dissemination of information, insubordination, unsatisfactory performance and violation of departmental rules and regulation.

State police spokesman David Procopio declined to describe the penalties Murphy faced, citing privacy laws governing employee records.

Murphy made world headlines in July after he released 14 crime-scene photos he'd taken of Tsarnaev as part of his official duties to the media.

The graphic images showed a battered, bloody then-19-year-old as he emerged from a boat he'd been cowering in with hands raised the night he was captured by authorities.

Murphy said he was so enraged by the August cover of music magazine Rolling Stone, which depicted the suspect as a rock star that he handed the grisly images to Boston Magazine. He argued Rolling Stone had glamorized terrorism by running the picture of Tsarnaev looking like a hippy.

Murphy argued his images showed the true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them without authorization.

Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorisation of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these photos

Support: Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 66,000 people having 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page

Murphy was first suspended and then assigned to desk duty before being transferred from the state police barracks in Framingham to Athol.

However, he never actually worked out of the Athol barracks because he was on leave for an injury sustained off the job.

At the time the photos were released, Murphy wrote in a posting on the Boston Magazine website: 'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets. This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.'

Victims and their families jumped to 
Murphy's defense, describing his actions as selfless and an attempt to 
right Rolling Stone's wrong.

The wider community also labeled him a 'hero' and his decision to release the images received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 66,000 people liking a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page.
