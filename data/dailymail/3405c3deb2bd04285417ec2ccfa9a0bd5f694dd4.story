A woman has spoken of her 'total shock' at becoming pregnant with triplets while taking the contraceptive pill. 

Christie Fletcher, 22, insists she had been taking the medication 'religiously' at the same time every day.

Despite this, doctors say she has beaten odds of 25,000 to one to give birth to non-identical triplets - something that only usually happens with the help of IVF.

Her sons Jorj, Isaac and Jac arrived four months ago and are all in perfect health.

Miss Fletcher, from Glyn Ceriog, Wrexham, was already mother to two-year-old  Osian, when she and her partner Carwyn, 27, got the astonishing news.

She said: 'I was so shocked to find that I was pregnant again. I had been taking my pill carefully and never in a million years did I expect to end up with triplets.

'I was on the pill when I fell pregnant with Osian, but I hadn't really been that careful in making sure I took it at the same time.

'After I had him, I was so strict about taking my pill every day as according to instructions - I took it religiously at the same time every single day.

'There was no way on earth I ever thought I'd end up pregnant again.'

But she suspected something was up when she randomly began to start feeling sick.

'I was at a bonfire party when I didn't know if I wanted to eat a burger or be sick. 

My hormones were all over the place and I recognised the feeling from my first pregnancy, but I told myself I couldn't be pregnant as I had been taking my Pill.'

The couple were in for more even more of a shock when they attended their first scan and the nurse broke the news they were expecting triplets

The boys arrived four months ago and are all in perfect health. Jorj was the biggest of the three, weighing 4lbs 13oz, while his brother Isaac weighed 4lb 8oz and Jac weighed just 4lbs 3.5oz

Concerned, she decided to do a pregnancy test and was 'gobsmacked' to find out she was expecting.

Dr Surabhi Nanda, from Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'According to Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, with perfect use, the failure rate of the combined pill is 0.3 per cent and with typical use is around nine per cent.

'Certain medications including some antibiotics or anti epilepsy drugs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill and thereby increase the failure rates.

'As such, the chance of having a naturally conceived triplet pregnancy is approximately 1 in 6,000 to 8,000 births and even rarer for non-identical triplets.

'It is difficult to say whether the getting pregnant on the pill and conceiving a triplet pregnancy are directly related, as the odds of both the events happening concurrently are indeed very low.'  

She said: 'I was stunned - and Carwyn was as shocked and surprised as I was.

I had only just had my first born and suddenly we were having another. I had been taking my pill every day so I couldn't believe I was pregnant.'

The couple were in for more even more of a shock when they attended their first scan and the nurse broke the news they were expecting triplets.

Miss Fletcher said: 'When I was having my bump scanned, I knew something was up. 

'The nurses went very quiet and were staring at each other, smiling but with a look of disbelief on their face.

'They told me to look at the screen, and I could see three little babies in there.

'I just said "Oh my god" and couldn't believe it - I thought I was in a dream.' 

She gave birth at eight months to baby Jorj, the biggest of the three who was born weighing 4lbs 13oz and his brother Isaac, 4lb 8oz and Jac who weighed just 4lbs 3.5oz. 

Miss Fletcher said: 'Having this many babies takes some getting used to. And they certainly keep me busy but I love my huge brood.'

'I now have my hands full with four boys and I don't plan on having any more. I'm not relying on the pill again though - this time I'm making sure I get the implant.'

Dr Surabhi Nanda, from Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'According to Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, with perfect use, the failure rate of the combined pill is 0.3 per cent and with typical use is around nine per cent.

'Certain medications including some antibiotics or anti-epilepsy drugs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill and thereby increase the failure rates.
