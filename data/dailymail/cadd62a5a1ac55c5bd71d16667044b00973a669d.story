Islamist militants fighting for ISIS in Iraq and Syria have paid tribute to an alleged British-born fighter that they say was killed during a battle with Iraqi SWAT forces.

Social media accounts understood to belong to ISIS members currently fighting in the Middle East said a Briton referred to by the nom de guerre Abul Baraa was killed fighting government forces near Ramadi - a town 75 miles west of Baghdad.

The news comes as Iraq sent an additional 4,000 mainly Shi'ite troops to the embattled town to help bolster government forces locked in a running battle with Sunni militants.

Reports that a British-born jihadist may have been killed fighting in Ramadi emerged on the social media account of Abu Dujana Al Britani - a social media savvy Islamist who says he is based in the Syrian city of Homs.

The suffix 'al-Britani' refers to a fighter who has travelled to the Middle East from Britain.

Over a series of four messages, Abu Dujana describes how two months ago he met two British fighters among a group of new ISIS recruits in the city of Aleppo in Syria, which he refers to by its ancient name Halab.

He goes on to say that he met with a Tunisian member of this international group of trainees in the Syrian city of Raqqa yesterday, where he was told that one of the two Britons had been killed.Â

Abu Dujana goes on to describe the militant as 'very humble and pious' and says he had come to the Middle East against the advice of 'Jihadi peers' in the UK.

Raqqa, where Abu Dujana claims to have heard news of the British militant's death, is considered the capital of the Islamic State - the name ISIS has given to its recently established caliphate.

The embattled city of Ramadi, on the other hand, is in overwhelmingly Sunni territory held by the Shii'te-led Iraqi government.

The Shi'ite-dominated force ensuring the town remains in the hands of the government is made up almost entirely of reservists who answered calls by Iraq's leading Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to take up arms against the brutal Sunni insurgency.

The government's reliance on Shi'ite troops to fight Sunni militants is fueling fears Iraq could descend into the kind of sectarian bloodletting that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007.

Ramadi is capital of the Sunni-majority province of Anbar, much of which has fallen to ISIS forces.

Insurgents took control of Ramadi and the neighbouring town of Falluja earlier this year. The government has reestablished control of Ramadi but Falluja remains in militant hands.
