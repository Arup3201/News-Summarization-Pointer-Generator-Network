Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul will be fit to face Leicester City on Saturday.

There had been fears that the 26-year-old was set for a spell on the sidelines after the club confirmed ligament damage in an elbow injury picked up while on international duty with Holland.

But the Magpies are confident he will be okay to take his place in the side against the Foxes.

The injury was not as bad as first feared and Krul will be fit to face Leicester on Saturday

The news will come as a relief to manager Alan Pardew, whose side need to win to avoid setting a new club record of eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season. 

A club statement read: 'Tim Krul has been further assessed today by the club's medical staff and the club can confirm that he has nothing more than a very minor elbow injury. The club will continue to monitor the situation but are confident that he will be available for the game against Leicester City on Saturday.' 

United are unable to recall Nottingham Forest loanee Karl Darlow – who they signed during the summer – meaning Rob Elliot was set to deputise if Krul was ruled out.

The former Charlton stopper made two Premier League appearances last season but the Magpies were beaten 4-0 on both occasions, away to Southampton and at home to Manchester United.
