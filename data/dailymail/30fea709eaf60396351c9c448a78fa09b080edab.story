If trekking the Great Wall of China or taking in the breathtaking views of the Grand Canyon make an appearance on you bucket list, you are not alone.

A new survey suggests that far from being couch potatoes as we're often portrayed, the British are really rather an adventurous bunch. At least in theory... 

Figures from the CWM FX London Boat Show reveal that 40 per cent of Brits dream of making a pilgrimage to The Great Wall of China, which stretches for an incredible 5,500 miles across north of the country, while just over a third of people claim that visiting the Grand Canyon in Arizona tops their list of dream destinations.

The Great Wall of China is top of the bucket list for around 40 per cent of adventurous Brits

It may not actually be a canyon, but the Grand Canyon in Arizona is stunning

A quarter of Britons say that trekking the Inca trail is top of the dream destinations

And we're not afraid to strap on our walking boots either. Trekking the famous Inca Trail in Peru to reach the 15th-century ruins at Machu Picchu comes in at number three on the list, with a quarter of people claiming it is their most aspirational adventure.

This is closely followed by 21 per cent of Brits who say they dream of walking the length of the mighty River Nile.

And it appears that we're a fearless lot, as well. Around 17 per cent of those polled said they dream of diving with great white sharks, and a further 15 per cent are willing to risk life and limb (and maybe the odd finger tip) to climb to the summit of Mount Everest. 

You looking at me? Forget dolphins, 17 per cent of Brits say they want to dive with great white sharks

Skydiving over the Great Barrier Reef in Australia makes number seven on the list

1.Walking along the Great Wall of China - 40%

2. Hiking into the Grand Canyon - 31%

3. Trekking the Inca trail - 25%

4. Walking the Nile - 21%

5. Diving with great white sharks - 17%

6. Hiking the great Himalaya trail, Nepal - 17%

7. Skydiving over the Great Barrier Reef - 16%

8. Climbing the summit of Mount Everest -15%

9. Expedition across the Antarctic - 13%

10. White water rafting down the Coruh River in Turkey -10% 

But while men are more interested in water-based adventures, such as white water rafting down the Coruh River in Turkey, or sailing solo across the Atlantic, women prefer to keep their feet firmly on the ground. 

The female of the species is just as adventurous as their male counterparts but, according to the figures, they'd rather walk their way around the world, visiting the Himalaya's in Nepal and trekking through South America. 

In reality, however, many of us will be staying a little closer to home during 2015. 

A separate survey by comparison website TravelSupermarket suggests that just under a third of Brits will be opting for a staycation this year. 

Skydiving over the Great Barrier Reef will just have to wait...

While 32 per cent of Brits will opt for a staycation this year, 13 per cent of us still dream of trekking across the Antarctic

Around 15 per cent of Britons say that climbing to the summit of Mount Everest tops their bucket list
