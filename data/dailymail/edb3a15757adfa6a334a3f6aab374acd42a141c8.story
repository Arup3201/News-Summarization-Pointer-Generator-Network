A father is fighting for his life today after confronting a thief trying to steal his car from his driveway.

The 49-year-old victim, named locally as Dean Armitage, is thought to have disturbed the thief after he heard them breaking into his Land Rover outside his smart detached home and starting the engine.

Neighbours say the suspect climbed into Mr Armitage's home and stole the keys from the kitchen - and when they started the car the noise woke him up in bed.

Dean Armitage is thought to have spotted someone breaking into his Land Rover and confronted the thief - but was brutally attacked

The haulage company boss confronted the thief but was attacked and left in a critical condition with serious head injuries.

Neighbours Gerald and Sylvia Whyke told how they were woken just after 3am.

Retired Gerald said: 'It only took me a matter of minutes to get outside but when I got there, the police and ambulance were arriving.

'Dean’s wife Mandy was on the driveway next to the car. She was speaking to her neighbours on the other side over the wall.

'She was distraught. She seemed to be in shock. It was only when the ambulance people swooped in that I realised there was someone lying on the driveway between them all.

'Then the paramedics took Dean off to hospital. It all happened very quickly. The police were taking statements from everyone.'

Mrs Whyke, 69, said she saw a man fleeing the scene in Hoyland, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, at 3.15am on Sunday.

She said: 'I went over to the bedroom window to see what was going on. I saw someone running off from the direction of the house next door.

'It all happened really quickly, I don’t know what they look like at all. It was very dark.

'Dean is a really hard-working man. We don’t see much of him because he is always at work, working hard for his family. But when we do see him he is lovely and friendly.'

Mrs Whyke added the street, a combination of detatched and semi-detatched houses, was a friendly neighbourhood where everyone says hello.

She said: 'The family have lived here for about 25 years, we’ve seen their children grow up and that sort of thing. I can’t believe it.'

Shelby Etherington, 18, said her uncle is 'a lovely guy'.

Speaking today she said: 'He doesn't deserve this. The family are at his side at hospital, we're all just hoping and praying that  he is okay.

'It's been a huge shock for us all.'

A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: 'It is thought the unknown male may have been attempting to break into the 49-year-old man’s car.

'Following the confrontation, the 49-year-old man was left with serious head injuries and was transported to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield.

'His condition is described as life threatening.'

Neighbours Valerie, 73, a retired bakery worker and Graham Thompson, 73, who worked at refractory works before retiring, also described Mr Armitage as a friendly neighbour.

Valerie said: 'Someone has suggested that someone had sneaked into the kitchen through an open window and taken the car keys and some handbags. They started the car and that’s when Dean heard.'

The car, which had been parked in the driveway, has been removed from the scene.
