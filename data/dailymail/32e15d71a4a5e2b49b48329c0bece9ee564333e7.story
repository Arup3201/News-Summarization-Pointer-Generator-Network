The candidate tipped to replace Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has bowed out of the race.

Michele Flournoy, 52, withdrew her candidacy  on Tuesday citing 'family issues.'

She had been the main contender for the top job at the Pentagon in President Obama’s second term.

But she hastily announced her decision to step aside in a letter to the Center for a New American Security.

The mother-of-three sent the letter to the think tank's board Tuesday saying she had asked the president to take her out of consideration for the Pentagon job over family issues. 

A source close to Flournoy said she had several concerns about the job, including whether she would be given more latitude than Hagel in policy making. 

Pentagon officials have long griped about White House micromanagement, and Hagel was largely seen as someone who would acquiesce to the West Wing.

Flournoy, had previously served as a top Pentagon official during Obama's first term, then returned to the Center for a New American Security, the think tank she co-founded. 

The Oxford graduate's departure underscores the difficulty President Barack Obama faces while finding a candidate to take the helm at the Pentagon.

He has been forced to make the decision late in his second term amid fierce criticism of his administration's handling of crises in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world.

It is thought that he considered Flournoy to be an exemplary candidate.

Mulling over key jobs: President Obama is attempting to find a candidate to take the helm at the Pentagon

She holds a Master of Letters postgraduate degree from Oxford, where she was a Newton-Tatum scholar at Balliol College.

She spent two decades climbing to 
the top of the notoriously male-dominated US national security 
establishment, winning the admiration of politicians and military 
chiefs.

After working in the Pentagon under 
Bill Clinton, Mrs Flournoy returned in the department’s Number three position — 
undersecretary of defence for policy — when Mr Obama began his first 
term in 2009.

She resigned last February, saying she wanted to spend more time with her three children. 

However, since news of her departure emerged, several other candidates have become front runners.

They include Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who previously served as the Pentagon's general counsel, according to several people close to the process.

Johnson is highly regarded by the West Wing, particularly following the months long process he oversaw to identify the immigration executive actions Obama announced last week.

But given Republicans' staunch opposition to that action, tapping Johnson for the Pentagon post risks turning his confirmation hearing into a fierce debate on immigration.

The president would also need to fill the top job at Homeland Security again just as the department is implementing the immigration actions.

Two Pentagon veterans are also seen as contenders for the department's job: former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Robert Work, who currently holds the Number two job at the Pentagon.

Still, Flournoy's decision to withdraw removes a candidate who was seen as being at the top of Obama's list. 

In 2012, she was considered for defense secretary and would have been the first woman to head the Pentagon.

Hagel submitted his resignation Monday under pressure from the president. 

The former Republican senator struggled to break through Obama's insular inner circle of foreign policy advisers. 

And despite the White House's desire to have a less independent Pentagon chief, officials privately complained about Hagel's lack of engagement in national security deliberations.

The White House would not comment on the process to nominate Hagel's successor.

National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said: 'The president is considering a number of well qualified candidates however, I don't have any personnel announcements at this time.'
