Philip Johnson sees no significance in Valentine's Day.

The dedicated husband, who moved into an aged-care facility in Sydney to be with his beloved wife of nearly 63 years, says February 14 'is just another day'.

The 88-year-old cherishes every single moment he's able to spend with Eileen, 86, who only has limited speech after suffering a stroke five years ago.

Consequently Mrs Johnson is physically weak and needs full-time care.

But whether it be in sickness or in health, her husband - who does not require care himself - patiently sits with her by the window every day and holds her hand every chance he gets.

Philip Johnson was 18-years-old when he first met his future wife through a friend.

His first thought when he saw her was: 'God she's a cracker.'

But it was September 6, 1952 that Mr Johnson recalls as the best day of his life - the day he married Eileen. 

The pair moved from the UK to Australia when their daughters were 10 and six and settled down in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney.

Mr and Mrs Johnson now have three grandchildren.

Five years ago Mr Johnson, who worked as a sales rep for British–Dutch consumer company Unilever until he was 58, made the decision to sell his unit soon after his wife's stroke.

Mrs Johnson had to be moved into the Whiddon Group Easton Park residential home in Glenfield, southwest Sydney, and a few months later Mr Johnson packed up his belongings and followed suit.

Now his wife, who was once the personal assistant for a director at Grace Brothers - today known as Myer, is only able to repeat a phrase about American soldiers and say 'thank you'.

Despite the severe impacts of her stroke, Mr Johnson is able to understand exactly what his wife tries to express. He says he can't explain it, he just knows. 

'One of the impacts of Eileen's stroke was the effect on her speech, she can't speak so well anymore. I try to visualise what she means. Really, we just got on with life,' Mr Johnson said.

Most of their time spent together involves sitting by the window, hand-in-hand, as Mr Johnson quietly speaks to his wife. He says they can't do much because of her stroke.

In the afternoon Mrs Johnson prefers to retreat to her room as she becomes too tired. 

Mr Johnson jokingly called this 'boring' but it's evident that he's still cares so deeply for his wife.

He was teary as he said: 'We have grown older but are still very much in love.'

Mr Johnson will be gifting his wife 'the usual' flowers and chocolates on February 14 but this is no different from any other day.

'Valentine's Day is just another day, every day is special and a celebration to us,' he said.
