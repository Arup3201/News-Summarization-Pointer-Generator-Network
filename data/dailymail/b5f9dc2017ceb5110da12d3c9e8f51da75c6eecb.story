Police forces can never be free of corruption, a Scotland Yard chief has admitted.

Alaric Bonthron, head of anti-corruption at the Metropolitan Police, said trying to stop criminals infiltrating the ranks was a very difficult challenge.

‘There is a threat to any law enforcement agency,’ said the detective chief superintendent.

Challenge: Alaric Bonthron, head of Scotland Yard's anti-corruption unit, said corruption will always exist

‘You will never eliminate corruption. You can make it very difficult and put systems in place. Organised crime by its very nature is very challenging.

‘Has corruption gone away entirely? I don’t think it has, you have always got vulnerabilities.

‘Part of our role is to make sure the organisation is absolutely doing the best it can to be corruption-proof.’

Mr Bonthron, who took charge of the Metropolitan Police’s Professional Standards Unit nine months ago, said 99 per cent of officers are ‘honest, law-abiding individuals’.

Previously the work of the PSU has been shrouded in secrecy due to the nature of its work.

But in a frank interview, Mr Bonthron told The Independent newspaper: ‘One officer, one member of staff, headline news … and it discredits the organisation.’

Temptation: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, sparked outrage among some MPs last week when he said poorly-paid junior officers were more susceptible to bribes to make ends meet

The officer, who has worked in the police in London for 29 years, denied that the Met was rife with ‘endemic corruption’, as has been claimed was the case in the Eighties and Nineties when some of Britain’s most notorious criminals were allegedly able to gain influence and information to compromise investigations.

He said the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards has 385 staff, spending £24 million every year.

Sir Hugh Orde, one of Britain’s top officers, warned recently that police are more likely to take bribes if they are underpaid and have money problems.

Sir Hugh pointed to the £19,000 starting salary for junior PCs and said that financial pressure felt by ‘certain ranks’ could fuel a wave of corruption.
