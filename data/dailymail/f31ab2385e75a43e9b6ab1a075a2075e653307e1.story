A family got a nasty surprise when they went to Nando’s for a meal and were accidentally charged more than £6,000.

Days after a father of two was mistakenly charged £59,400 for four rolls of wrapping paper, Aurel Lupsa was overcharged for his Peri Peri chicken – and ended up paying £6,235.88.

Mr Lupsa, 43, a telecoms company director, said: ‘We eat at Nando’s all the time, but I’ve never had anything like this. I didn’t really notice I was overpaying to be honest.’ 

Aurel Lupsa was overcharged by more than £6,000 at the restaurant in Brent Cross, north London 

At the end of the meal, Mr Lupsa asked for the bill and told the waitress he wanted to pay by card. He went to the till where he was presented with a bill for £62.35 and then told to check the amount on the chip and pin machine screen.

But he didn’t realise the waitress had accidentally keyed in £6,235 – 100 times more than his actual bill.

Mr Lupsa said: ‘I initially asked if I could put a £7 tip on my bill, but then my wife had some change, so I asked the waitress to cancel the card tip.

During the confusion, she must have put in the wrong amount. Just as we were leaving, the server rushed over and said there had been a mistake. I’m definitely going to pay more attention in the future.’ 

While £6,235 is a large amount to pay at once, if Mr Lupsa’s account was in credit with this amount or more, the payment would have been approved.

Your bank can only refuse to make a payment if you do not have enough funds, if you have broken agreed terms and conditions – such as needing two signatures for a joint account payment – or if it suspects the payment is fraudulent.

Banks and card issuers use fraud screening systems to look at your spending profile and detect unusual patterns. Things that might raise concerns include making several purchases quickly, international payments or unusually expensive transactions. If potential fraud is detected, the card is normally blocked.

Your bank can only refuse to refund unauthorised payments if it can prove you authorised the transaction or failed to protect your card details, or if you flag up the payment 13 months or more after it left your account.

The blunder came as Mr Lupsa visited a Nando’s branch at Brent Cross in North London with his wife Bianca, 43, their seven-year-old daughter Evelyn, his niece and her husband.

The table-of-five dined out on wings and Peri Peri chicken before Mr Lupsa settled the bill as a festive treat for his family on December 30. 

Mr Lupsa, from Barnet, North London, added: ‘Mistakes happen and I’m very glad they caught it before I walked away.’

He added: ‘I can’t believe the most expensive meal of my life was at Nando’s. It’s good chicken, but it’s not that good.’ Nando’s said they were aware of the incident and are investigating.

A spokesman for Nando's said: 'Our staff were under the impression the customer ordered our 1992 vintage Peri-Peri sauce - hence the confusion!

'We immediately refunded the transaction and apologised for the error.'

Last week a father told of his horror when he was charged nearly £60,000 for wrapping paper for his children's Christmas presents. 

Dean Baker from Birmingham complained to the Card Factory which overcharged him, but was only reimbursed following a public campaign. 

Mr Baker, 32, said the mistake left him unable to buy last-minute presents for his daughters Eden, seven, and 18-month-old Harriet.

The cable engineer, from Erdington, Birmingham, said: ‘The girl on the till was a trainee. When I put my card in the machine she said it hadn’t worked and asked me to do it again, so I did. I didn’t think of it any more.’ 

The family dined on chicken wings and chips before being given the astonishing bill in north London

Mr Lupsa was with his wife, Bianca Minolachi (left) and their daughter, Evelyn (right), at the time 

He only became aware there was a problem when his card was declined on Christmas Eve.

‘I went to a cashpoint and couldn’t believe my eyes when the balance came up as nearly £60,000 overdrawn,’ he said.

The money has now been refunded and Mr Baker received apologies from TSB Bank and Card Factory.

Last year a teenager in Wales was also left massively overdrawn after he was charged £179,932.32 for a pizza from Domino’s in Newport. Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, tried to pay for the £17.99 meal with his card.

Domino’s staff were given an authorisation code of 3232– which was accidentally added to the price. When his card was declined at a supermarket, he decided to check his account.

He said: ‘I was massively overdrawn. I was terrified I might have to pay it off.’

Domino’s and Lloyds Bank investigated, the money was paid back two days later and a Lloyds spokesman said the bank ‘regretted the inconvenience’.
