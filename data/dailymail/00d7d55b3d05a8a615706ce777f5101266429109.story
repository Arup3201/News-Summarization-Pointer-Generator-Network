Israeli police say they have shot a man suspected of carrying out a terror attack that left at least five female officers suffering serious injuries this morning.

The suspect  is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west.

Photographs on social media suggest the suspect was left with serious injuries after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his vehicle and began attacking onlookers with a meat cleaver. There has not yet been an official confirmation of the man's condition.

The attack took place at a border police station on Shimon Ha'Tsadik Street, which marks the line between east and west Jerusalem, according to Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the local force.

The suspect is believed to be a Arab man in his early 30s who hails from east Jerusalem.

Paramedics said they administered first aid to at least five people, all female police officers. Three of the women are in a serious condition, while the other two escaped with only minor injuries. 

Witnesses on the ground claimed that after ploughing his car into the officers, the man got out the vehicle and attacked Israeli onlookers with a knife, although that report has not been confirmed.

The same border police station was subject to a hit and run attack in November that killed one police officer and left 13 other people suffering serious injuries.

'The incident was apparently a deliberate attack,' police spokeswoman Luba Samri said, adding that the driver had been taken to hospital in a serious condition.

The incident took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim, when the streets are busy with pedestrians.

Last October and November, there was a spate of similar attacks, with Palestinian drivers ramming their vehicles into people waiting at the city's light-rail stops. Those attacks killed three people and wounded around a dozen.

Tensions flared in Jerusalem last year, both before and after the Gaza war, but the city has been relatively calm in recent months.

On Thursday, the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to suspend security coordination with Israel in the occupied West Bank, which officials are concerned could have a knock-on impact on security throughout the territory.

The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war -- and in Gaza, a strip of land on the Mediterranean coast that is separated from the West Bank.

The attack comes just one week after the Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat instructed his bodyguards to apprehend a Palestinian man who had just stabbed an ultra-Orthodox Jew in the stomach in the middle of a busy street.

Mr Barkat said he and his staff were travelling in a car when he noticed the 'terrorist' with a knife.

He and his bodyguard leaped from their car to stop the attacker.

The bodyguard drew his firearm and wrestled the 18-year-old attacker to the ground and held him until police arrived.

The 27-year-old victim suffered a stab wound to the stomach and was only 'lightly injured' according to police.
