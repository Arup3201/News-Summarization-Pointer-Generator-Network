Police in Florida are desperately searching for a 33-year-old waitress who went missing last Thursday after going to a bar in Ybor City.

Apryl Foster was last seen walking alone at around 2.20am Thursday after spending time with a man at a karaoke bar.

On Monday, her parents, Peggy and Craig Beman, made a tearful plea to the public begging for help in finding Apryl.

Worried sick: Peggy Beman, Apryl's mother, said her daughter is very reliable, and she would not have taken off without telling her first

'We know she's not a perfect person, but she has been reliable,' her mother said during a press conference aired by ABC Action News.

Apryl Foster was reported missing by her family Friday morning. Tampa police say that while they have found no evidence to suggest foul play, they are concerned for the woman’s safety because it is unlike her to disappear without telling her family and friends.

Police say Apryl left work at Ulele restaurant in Tampa at 11pm Wednesday and met up with friends after at the Bad Monkey bar in Ybor City.

She left the establishment at 12.06am with a man she met at the bar, and the two headed to the Double Decker karaoke bar next door.

The couple briefly left the bar together and then returned.

At 2.19am, Foster and her mystery companion walked out of the bar a second time. The 33-year-old waitress headed alone east, while the man headed on foot west down 7th Avenue. She has not been heard from since.

Peggy Beman said she and her daughter are extremely close, and not a day goes by that they don’t communicate with one another.

Foster is an aspiring singer who works at a server and staff trainer at Ulele restaurant in Tampa 

Last sighting: Apryl was last seen leaving Double Decker karaoke bar in Ybor City, Florida, Thursday morning 

Miss Foster, an aspiring singer who works as a server and staff trainer at the Ulele restaurant in Tampa, would always call her mother in the morning and at night to let her know how she was doing, and recently the two have started exchanging text messages as well.

Mrs Beman said her daughter would not have taken off without telling her first, and she would not have left her cats, who were like children to her, alone and without food for such an extended period of time.

‘This just isn't her,’ said Foster's distraught mother. ‘We know something happened.’ 

Peggy Beman added that her daughter is someone who's never missed a day's work, not even when she was sick with the flu recently.

By Friday afternoon, a sheriff's deputy accessed Foster's apartment in Brandon to perform a welfare check, but the home was empty and he found nothing suspicious.

Investigators have since interviewed the man who was last seen with Foster Thursday morning, talked to her boyfriend, as well as her to estranged husband. They say everyone have been cooperative.

Heartbroken: Peggy and Craig Beman, Apryl's parents, made a tearful plea for help in finding their missing daughter 

Police also have obtained surveillance video from the vicinity of the two bars in Ybor City, but so far they have found nothing to raise a red flag.

Apryl Foster’s vehicle is described as a red 2009 Chevy Aveo hatchback with license plate number K125YC and a 'Huskers' vanity plate. 

Peggy Beman revealed that a little over two months ago, Apryl felt like she needed to get away to clear her head. But before heading to Orlando, she called her mother and let her know that she will be temporarily turning off her cellphone.

She also provided her with the name of the hotel where she was staying and promised to switch on her phone later that afternoon.

'That's how informative she was,' the woman recalled.

Mrs Beman said the last time she and Apryl spoke on the phone was at around 11pm Wednesday. Her daughter was searching for a part for her broken windshield wiper and asked Peggy to go online and help her look for it.

Police have been scouring the area in search of the woman, even flying a helicopter over the route from Ybor City to Brandon.

They also have checked her bank account for any activity, but have found none. They are now waiting to subpoena her credit card account.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-873-TIPS or Tampa Police 813-231-6130.
