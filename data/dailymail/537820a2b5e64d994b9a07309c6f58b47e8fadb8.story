The house in Kensington where Mayir Naturbhai Patel illegally extended his home

A man who extended his £2.8million home in one of Kensington's most exclusive streets without planning planning permission has been fined £40,000.

Mayur Naturbhai Patel admitted breaching the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 after he made major rooftop alterations to his property without permission and did not comply with a council enforcement notice requiring them to be removed.

The extension made room for a new staircase and an ensuite bedroom and could have added hundreds of thousands of pounds to the four-storey property.

Sentencing was referred to Isleworth Crown Court as it has the power to deal with a proceeds of crime action instigated by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

The authority wanted to prevent Patel, 54, from profiting financially from the additional floor space created by his illegal development.

He was fined £15,000 and also had £23,350 confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act and was warned the faced 15 months in prison if he fails to pay the confiscation order in three months. 

In his closing remarks His Honour Judge Phillip Matthews said he did not ascribe shady motives when imposing the financial penalty, but thought Patel had acted with the 'utmost stupidity' and that it was no mitigation to say he relied on the advice of architects.

Neighbours complained to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea after work began to build the extension

At his original hearing on last month, magistrates heard how Patel failed to comply with a planning enforcement notice served by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in November 2012.

Enforcement officers issued the notice following complaints that major work was underway.

One of Mr Patel's neighbours, Aaron Jessop, told the Evening Standard: 'It is as if it 
happened overnight. Scaffolding was erected, screening went up to hide 
the work and suddenly this thing started to grow up.'

On inspection they discovered that the roof had been altered and that a large roof extension and a rear roof had been constructed, all of which is unauthorised development harming the appearance of the Norland Conservation Area where the property stands

Despite the four months allowed under the notice to restore the property, and a number of reminders, most of the work required remains outstanding, but still needs to be undertaken to avoid potential further action by the council.

In his defence Mr Patel claimed to have received verbal confirmation from his architect and a planning officer that the alterations would be acceptable.

Councillor Timothy Coleridge, cabinet member for planning policy, said: 'I am very pleased that the court has made this ruling.

'We were determined that Mr Patel should not gain financially from his illegal development.'
