A witness in the Michael Brown trial claimed she had filmed the unarmed teen being shot with his hands in the air, but then lost the footage after she dropped her phone down the toilet.

The witness, a mother-of-four, lives in an apartment complex adjacent to the street in Ferguson, Missouri, where Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9.

Identified as 'Witness 41' in grand jury records released by St. Louis prosecutors, she testified on October 27 that Brown was shot while on his knees with his hands up.

A witness in the Michael Brown trial claimed she had filmed the unarmed teen being shot with his hands in the air, but then lost the footage after she dropped her phone down the toilet

The woman didn't mention the recording while on the witness stand, but told prosecutors in passing as she leaving along with her godson, known as 'Witness 42'.

According to prosecutor Kathi Alizadeh, she commented that it was 'too bad there weren't surveillance cameras in the complex' during the conversation in a corridor as the witness were leaving

'Witness 41' replied that 'she had video of 'the entire thing on her phone' but had 'dropped the phone in the toilet' reports The Smoking Gun.

Alizadeh then asked if she could have the phone so it could undergo a 'forensic examination' to determine if the video could be recovered.

'Witness 41' then explained that she had thrown the phone away because she was so mad.

Rather than a missed opportunity for vital evidence which could have impacted the verdict, the bizarre admission seemed to harm the witness' credibility.

Alizadeh notes that 'Witness 42', her godson – who lived next door – indicated that he had not heard the information before.

'This was news to him as well because he asked her where is the phone and, you know, he seemed to indicate that he had not heard that information before,' she told jurors. 'So I thought it was important that you know that.'

Prosecutors gave the panel the option of recalling 'Witness 41' for further sworn testimony, but she never returned to the witness stand. 

The witness had first been interviewed about the case in her apartment on August 26, but had failed to mention any recording of the event.

Instead ‘Witness 41’ told FBI agents that Officer Wilson had stood over his teenage victim and ‘just finished him up’ with a shot to the head.

The interview took place prior to the publication of details of Brown’s autopsy which showed that he was not shot in the back or ‘finished’ by Wilson.

When one of the FBI agents told 'Witness 41' that he didn’t believe her claims she became upset.

She asked the interviewer to erase the recording of her interview and when they declined, she picked up the recorder and shut it off.

After agreeing to resume the interview, ‘Witness 41’ said her ‘first statement was not completely true.’

When she retold her account, she changed one important fact and said her vantage point had been from behind Brown, not in front of the teenager.

Despite all this, ‘Witness 41’ was called before the Ferguson grand jury and told the panel that she has been diagnosed with ‘mood swings, three personalities,’ and takes pills for a mental health condition.
