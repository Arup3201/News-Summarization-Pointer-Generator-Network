Apple is said to have been toying with the idea of launching a TV and streaming service for years and new reports suggest it could finally launch as early as this summer.

Unnamed sources told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant plans to launch a 25-channel service that will be streamed to Apple TV, iPhones, iPads and other iOS devices.

Rumours suggest it will cost up to $40 a month making it more like an online cable service than a Netflix rival. 

Unnamed sources have told The Wall Street Journal that the tech giant plans to launch a 25-channel service that will be streamed to iOS devices. Rumours suggest it will cost up to $40 (£27) a month. The news follows Apple's partnership with HBO for HBO Now (pictured), announced at its Watch event earlier this month

Channels are expected to include CBS, ESPN and FX, but it will strip out some of the smaller channels that come packaged on cable services. 

It is also expected to only be available in the US, although this hasn't been confirmed.  

The news follows Apple's partnership with HBO, announced at its Watch event earlier this month. 

Called HBO Now, the on-demand service is launching exclusively on Apple devices next month and this is said to be a 'taster' for what's to come later this year. 

At its Watch event earlier this month Tim Cook announced Apple's partnership with HBO for the launch of HBO Now. 

The on-demand service will offer all of HBO's shows for $14.99 a month.

HBO's boss Richard Plepler said: 'All you need is a broadband connection and an Apple device.'

There will be a brand new HBO Now channel on Apple TV, iPhones and iPads.

The service is launching in April, in time for Game of Thrones and for people who sign up in April, they will get the first month free. 

Apple also dropped the price of its TV box from $99 to $69 and Mr Cook hinted at plans for an updated Apple TV set.

'Apple TV will reinvent the way you watch television - and this is just the beginning,' said the chief executive.

Apple also recently cut the price of its Apple TV from $99 to $69. 

Last month reports claimed Apple was working on a Netflix rival. 

Sources at the time said the service would put together bundles of programming, rather than entire TV lineups. 

And Apple is said to have shown programmers demos of the proposed service, but talks seem to be in the early stages.

Apple has made repeated attempts to crack the TV business. 

In his biography of Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson quoted the late Apple co-founder as saying : 'I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' 

'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.''

In 2009, Apple proposed a $30-a-month subscription service, and since then the company has periodically tried different strategies. 

Apple's most recent plan has been to work with pay-TV providers like Time Warner Cable to provide a hardware/software offering to those company's customers.

Apple boss Tim Cook has also said several times  the company wants to figure out how to crack TV.

At the Code conference last May, Apple media boss Eddy Cue told Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher that 'the TV experience sucks.'

'All we have today is glorified VCRs,' Cue said, saying the only big improvement is that now you don't have to reset the clock when the power goes out.

'The experience has been stuck.'

Apple also recently bought an Israeli firm that creates technology which could mean the end of the TV remote - and even the computer keyboard and was recently granted a patent for 'Minority Report'-style 3D gesture controls.

The system uses a 3D camera to track movement, and use it to control an on screen interface - which could be a computer or the much anticipated Apple TV.
