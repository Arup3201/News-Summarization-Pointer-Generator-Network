Rio Ferdinand has revealed that he wants to become the manager of Manchester United in the future.

Ferdinand spent 12 years at Old Trafford before moving to Queens Park Rangers in the summer.

The 35-year-old is already planning for life after his playing career ends - and, though cautious not to aim for too much too soon, he is aiming to one day reach what he feels is the pinnacle of management at United or England.

Ferdinand told the Manchester Evening News: 'I am not going to look that far ahead. I am taking all my coaching badges and everything I need to do and then we shall see what opportunities arise.

'I am not stupid enough to think that I will pass all my badges and then Manchester United will come asking me to become their manager. But I want to be the best in whatever field I go into and that means managing a big club like United or your country.

'Every player and manager will tell you that when you are growing up you want to play for the best team and it is the same in management.'
