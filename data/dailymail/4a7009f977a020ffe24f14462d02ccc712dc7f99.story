A retired banker has won a six-figure publishing deal for her debut novel series which is described as a cross between 'The Social Network and Wolf of Wall Street.' 

Michelle Miller started her first novel, The Underwriting, as a weekly serial published online. Each installment took approximately 30 minutes to read and were followed by a large number of fans.

However, GP Putnam's Sons and Penguin Books have announced a six-figure deal for the first two books in Ms Miller's planned five-book series. 

Former banker Michelle Miller has secured a six-figure deal for her debut novel based on high finance 

The first novel is due to be published in the U.S. on May 26 with the follow-up book scheduled for December 2015.

A UK edition of the book, by Text Publishing will be released on June 25.

The Underwriting was initially published in 12 weekly installments on Ms Miller's website.

According to GP Putnam: 'The Social Network meets The Wolf of Wall Street in The Underwriting, as it takes you behind closed doors into a post-recession world of sex scandals, power plays, and underhanded dealings.

'Todd Kent is young, hot, and on his way to the top of Wall Street when the eccentric founder of Hook, the popular new dating app, handpicks him to lead its IPO. 

'Given just two months to pull it off, Todd and his investment banking team — brainy Neha, party-boy Beau, and old college flame Tara Taylor — race to close the $14 billion deal of the decade. 

'It’s the chance of a lifetime for Tara, too, who sees her opportunity to break through the glass ceiling and justify six years of sacrifices for her career. But nothing is what it seems in Silicon Valley, and when tragedy strikes Stanford University’s campus, there’s no telling where the sparks will fly.'

Lauren Weisberger, author of the Devil Wears Prada, pictured, praised Ms Miller's debut novel 

Lauren Weisberger, author of the Devil Wears Prada said: 'Michelle Miller's debut novel reads like a salacious, ripped-from-the headlines tell-all of Manhattan's young, wealthy, and uber-successful. From the very first page, I felt like I'd met these characters in real life: Todd, the hot, rich, d-bag banker; Tara, the striver perfectionist who can't quite please everyone; Kelly, the good girl with a secret, and Josh, the creepy savant genius who just might change the world. 

'What do they all have in common? A certain location-based hookup app that alters each of their lives in shocking ways. Get ready to settle in-you won't be able to put down this book.'
