Many of these vehicles helped seal World War Two victory for Britain, including on the beaches of Normandy, but today they rest in a 'vehicle graveyard' on a former RAF base left untouched since 1963.

The closed military site at RAF Folkingham in Lincolnshire is home to an ageing collection of decommissioned military vehicles, farming machinery and lorries dating from the 1940s, which aided the war effort here and in occupied Europe.

The hulking machines are parked in line, falling apart and forgotten, at the edge of the 6,000ft-long runway, some swallowed up by bushes and trees.

Rusting legend: This DUKW Amphibious vehicle, which was used during the D-Day landings, produced between 1942 and 1945, and used by the British Army up into the 1970s, sits at the closed military site at RAF Folkingham in Lincolnshire

Left to rot: This military-used Caterpillar tractor stands on the spot where it was dumped at a former RAF base left untouched for at least 50 years

Frozen: These ageing vehicles, some of which helped with the war effort, lay still lined up along the Lincolnshire runway

Kept for scrap: This wartime fuel pump engine has been stored at the former RAF site so that spare parts can be sold off

Urban explorer Steve Vernon, 36, photographed the strange collection of derelict automobiles.

He said: 'It is quite eerie - the vehicles were stretched along the runway for as far as I could see. I couldn't even see the end of the line.

'Seeing all those old trucks and tractors lined up next to each other in the middle of the countryside is bizarre.

'It is in the middle of nowhere and it was very cold. I wasn't sure I was supposed to be there so I was very careful not to disturb the vehicles.'

Forgotten: This disused crane stands among hundreds of other abandoned machines used by the forces up until 1963

Taken by nature: This bulldozer has been swallowed up by a bush while plants have grown in its tracks over the decades it has lay there untouched

Lost in the undergrowth: This military truck, a Thornycroft 'Antar' Mk 2, lies among the collection of decommissioned military vehicles, farming machinery and lorries

Mothballed: This truck, fitted with caterpillar tracks, stands rusting next to a pile of other equipment at RAF Folkingham

Destroyed: This pan scraper, a piece of agricultural machinery often used for the removal of earth, sand or in mines, lies decaying in the woods around the abandoned RAF Folkingham

Out of service: A disused caterpillar tractor previously used in agricultural work, stands alone surrounded by abandoned parts

On empty: These fuel gauges from a military vehicle are well preserved despite being left untouched for at least 50 years in rural Lincolnshire

RAF Folkingham, 30 miles south of Lincoln, had a 23-year life at the heart of the Second World War effort and later the Cold War.

When it opened in 1940, it was used as a dummy airfield, with fake planes and personnel, set up to draw the Luftwaffe away from RAF Spitalgate, just a mile away.

Later it was brought into use by the RAF and the U.S. Air Force, primarily as a home for airborne units. Soldiers were dropped into Italy in 1944 and later on D-Day by parachute.

After the war, it was a ballistic missile base, with weapons fuelled and ready to fire during the Cuban Missile Crisis in November 1962.

But within a year it was closed and is now in private hands.

The runway is home to several 
decommissioned World War II vehicles including a DUKW amphibious truck -
 the model which was used during the D-Day landings - as well as mobile 
pump engines and various military trucks.

Other pieces of agricultural machinery which litter the landscape include tractors, bulldozers, JCBs and earth-movers.

Bizarrely, Mr Vernon, from Doncaster, spotted the severed heads of two deers rotting inside an abandoned crane.

'I saw the antlers poking out of the crane and when I went for a closer look I saw two deer heads in there. One was on the drivers seat and the other was at the back of the cab,' he said.

'They can't have been there long, they were still quite intact.

'I have no idea why they were there, or how they got there.'

RAF Folkingham opened in 1940. During World War II it was used as an airfield for airborne units in the RAF and the United States Army Air Force.

The airfield was eventually sold off in August 1963 for agricultural use.

Today the remains of the airfield are located on private property. The main runway is used as hardstanding for hundreds of scrap vehicles.

The vehicles are all owned by Nelson M Green and Sons Ltd who store the decommissioned vehicles for sale of the spare parts.

Dramatic: Set in the flat Lincolnshire countryside, perfect for airfields, RAF Folkingham has hundreds of vehicles, lined up next to eachother, along its long runway

History: RAF Folkingham pictured left in May 1944, with the ends of runways numbered in this aerial from the time, and right, the mothballed airfield today

Strategic: Known as bomber country, Lincolnshire was covered in RAF bases, and Folkingham for much of the war was used as a decoy for a base a mile away towards Grantham
