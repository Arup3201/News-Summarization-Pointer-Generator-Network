When they won the EuroMillions jackpot three months ago, Adrian and Gillian Bayford announced they would be house hunting.

And this is the result.

The couple, who collected £148million from their win, are swapping their three bedroom house for a Grade II-listed Georgian mansion set in more than 100 acres of woods and farmland.

Trading up: The Georgian mansion is set in more than 100 acres of woods and farmland. The seven bedroom house has four marbled bathrooms and four receptions rooms

The seven bedroom house, which has four marbled bathrooms and four reception rooms, also has a three bedroom annexe, a lodge, a three bedroom farmhouse and four cottages.

Although the outbuildings were available separately, the couple are believed to have bought the entire site – which had an asking price of more than £6million.

A friend of the couple said: ‘Adrian and Gillian made no secret about wanting to buy a nice house when they went public with their win.

‘Some people expected them to move out of their old home straight away – but they have taken their time to find the ideal place. This new house is perfect for them. It is a wonderful property with plenty of land.’

A villager added: ‘The estate has been on the market for a few months.

‘Everyone around here has heard that the Bayfords have bought it and we are all pleased for them.’ Mrs Bayford’s new Audi was parked on the drive of the mansion in East Anglia last week, alongside vans believed to belong to local tradesmen.

The couple are thought to be living in their old house in Haverhill, Suffolk, while they wait to move to their new home and Mr Bayford is back at work selling second-hand albums at his Suffolk Music Centre shop in Haverhill.

The Bayfords, who have two children, won £148,656,000 on the EuroMillions draw with a Lucky Dip ticket in August.

A Camelot spokesman said: ‘People have obviously cottoned on to the fact they’ve moved but they don’t want to comment on that.’
