The engineer who was at the controls during a deadly New York train crash fell asleep, sources from the investigation claimed today.

William Rockefeller Jr, a 46-year-old operator with an unblemished record in his 20-year Metro-North career, told investigators after the crash that he had 'zoned out'.

The Metro-North Railroad commuter train was barreling down the track at 82mph before it derailed on Sunday along a sharp curve where the speed limit is 30mph. Four passengers died and 67 were injured.

Sources from the train crash investigation revealed that engineer William Rockefeller (pictured) admitted that he 'dozed off' seconds before the Metro-North train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in New York City

According to the New York Post, Rockefeller 'was just somehow inattentive' and only jolted into action when a whistle blew to warn him of how fast the train was traveling. The brakes were slammed - but it was too late to prevent disaster.

Some carriages rolled several times throwing people from them. Three people were found dead outside the train and one person inside. The train came to a stop on the banks of the Harlem River.

The NTSB investigation has revealed that six seconds before the derailment, the throttle went idle and one second later, the brakes dropped from 120PSI on the pressure gauge to zero.

Following the crash, Rockefeller was tested for drugs and alcohol but it is believed that neither was found in his system.

His cellphone has been taken for forensic analysis but it also not believed to have been a factor in the crash.Â

Sources told DNAInfo that the engineer virtually admitted that he dozed off as the train barreled at 82mph down a 70mph stretch to the 30mph zone.

There was no immediate reasons given as to why Rockefeller drifted off, with no suggestions he had been overworked or out late the previous night.

The train engineer was released from hospital on Monday night after sustaining minor injuries in the crash.

He is said to be thoroughly traumatized by the horrific crash and cooperating with the investigation.

'He's a sincere human being with an impeccable record that I know of. He's diligent and competent,' Anthony Bottalico, executive director of the rail employees union said.

Rockefeller has been an engineer for about 11 years and a Metro-North employee for about 20 years, he said.

The revelation that the commuter train, which was traveling from Poughkeepsie to New York City, derailed while barreling into a sharp curve at nearly three times the speed limit is fueling questions about whether automated crash-avoidance technology could have prevented the carnage.

Safety officials have championed what's known as positive train control technology for decades but the railroad industry has sought to postpone having to install it because of the high cost and technological issues.

Investigators haven't yet determined whether the weekend wreck, which killed four people and injured more than 60 others, was the result of human error or mechanical trouble.

But some safety experts said the tragedy might not have happened if Metro-North Railroad had the technology, and a senator said the derailment underscored the need for it.

'This incident, if anything, heightens the importance of additional safety measures, like that one,' said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, which also is served by Metro-North.

'I'd be very loath to be more flexible or grant more time.'

Federal authorities began righting the cars on Monday morning as they started an exhaustive investigation into what caused a Metro-North commuter train rounding a riverside curve to derail, killing four people

The train was going 82 mph as it entered a 30 mph turn Sunday morning and ran off the track, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener said on Monday. He cited information extracted from the train's two data recorders; investigators also began interviewing the train's crew.

The speed stunned officials - 'I gulped,' said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, (Democrat-New York).

Governor Andrew Cuomo said the NTSB findings make it clear 'extreme speed was a central cause' of the derailment and vowed to 'make sure any responsible parties are held accountable' after investigators determine why the train was going so fast.

'At this point in time, we can't tell' whether the answer is faulty brakes or a human mistake, Weener said.

Weener sketched a scenario suggesting that the throttle was let up and the brakes were fully applied way too late to stave off the crash.

He said the throttle went to idle six seconds before the derailed train came to a complete stop - 'very late in the game' for a train going that fast - and the brakes were fully engaged five seconds before the train stopped.

It takes about a quarter-mile to a half-mile to stop a train going 82 mph, according to Kevin Thompson, a Federal Railroad Administration spokesman.

Investigators are not aware of any problems with the brakes during the nine stops the train made before the derailment, Mr Weener said.

Positive train control, or PTC, is designed to forestall the human errors that cause about 40 per cent of train accidents, and uses GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding, derailing or going the wrong way.

The transportation safety board has urged railroads to install PTC in some form since 1970, and after a 2005 head-on collision killed 25 people near Los Angeles, Congress in 2008 ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by December 2015.

Metro-North has taken steps toward acquiring it but, like many rail lines, has advocated for a few more years to implement a costly system that railroads say presents technological and other hurdles.

Grady Cothen, a former FRA safety official, said a PTC system would have prevented Sunday's crash if the brakes were working normally. And Steve Ditmeyer, a former FRA official who teaches at Michigan State University, said the technology would have monitored the brakes and would not have allowed the train to exceed the speed limit.

'A properly installed PTC system would have prevented this train from crashing,' he said.

'If the engineer would not have taken control of slowing the train down, the PTC system would have.'

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs Metro-North, began planning for a PTC system as soon as the law was put into effect, spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said.

After some early-stage work such as buying radio frequencies, the MTA awarded $428 million in contracts in September to develop the system for Metro-North and its sister Long Island Rail Road.

But the MTA has advocated for an extension to 2018, saying it's difficult to install such a system across more than 1,000 rail cars and 1,200 miles of track.

'It's not a simple, off-the-shelf solution,' Anders said on Monday.

On Sunday, the train was about half full, with about 150 people aboard, when it ran off the rails while rounding a bend where the Harlem and Hudson rivers meet. The lead car landed inches from the water.

The dead were identified as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; and Kisook Ahn, 35, of Queens.

Some of the injured remained hospitalized Monday, including seven in intensive care at one hospital and two patients in critical condition at another.

The train was configured with its locomotive in the back instead of the front. Weener said that is common, and a train's brakes work the same way no matter where the locomotive is located. Ditmeyer said the locomotive's location has virtually no effect on train safety.

Still, some people feel the configuration provides less protection for passengers because if the train hits something, there's no locomotive in front to absorb the blow, said Bill Henderson, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA, a riders' advocacy group.

The derailment came amid a troubled year for Metro-North, and marked the first time in the railroad's 31-year history that a passenger was killed in an accident.

In May, a train derailed in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and was struck by a train coming in the opposite direction, injuring 73 passengers, two engineers and a conductor. In July, a freight train full of garbage derailed near the site of Sunday's wreck.
