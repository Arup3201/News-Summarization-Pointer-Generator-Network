A high school cheerleader in Minneapolis, Minnesota plead guilty Friday to pimping out a girl on her squad.

18-year-old Montia Parker plead guilty on three counts of prostitution Friday including solicitng a minor to practice prostitution, first-degree sex trafficking of a minor and first-degree promotion of prostitution of a minor, according to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.

The charges stem from an illegal business Parker started with one of her teammates at Hopkins High School.

On March 1, that teammate approached Parker asking if she knew a way of making money.

According to the criminal complaint, Parker told her she could make money by giving men oral sex.

The victim agreed and soon after, Parker sent a message to her on Facebook asking for her contact information and told her to take pictures that were 'not too nasty but kinda cute' for an advertisement on Backpage.com.

On March 5, Parker texted the 16-year-old victim and told her to leave school and meet her in her car.

The two teens drove to an apartment where the victim performed oral sex on a man for $60 dollars.

The victim gave Parker the money and Parker kept it - giving nothing to the victim.

The next day, Parker set up another transaction - this time for vaginal sex.

However, the victim told Parker she did not want to perform vaginal sex, and offered to do oral sex instead.

The client declined and no money was exchanged.

The prostitution was discovered when the victim's mother got a message about unexcused absences from school.

She checked her daughter's phone and found texts between her and Parker discussing the prostitution and called the police.

When asked about her crimes in her court appearance Friday, Parker responded: 'Guilty. Regretful. Remorseful.'

Parker faces 45 to 60 months in prison and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for October 11.Â
