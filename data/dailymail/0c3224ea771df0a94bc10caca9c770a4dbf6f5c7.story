U.S. senators told MailOnline during a weekend presidential candidate cattle-call that Attorney General Eric Holder's credibility is on its last legs, that he owes one Republican lawmaker an apology, and that it's time for his exit if he won't indict a corrupt Obama administration official

Holder has frayed the GOP's collective nerves in the past two years, presiding over what they see as a wall of silence that impedes congressional oversight and gives a middle finger to legislators' lawful subpoenas for tens of thousands of documents.

Last week the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee passed a resolution calling on the whole House to vote Lois Lerner, a former IRS official, in contempt of Congress for her refusal to answer questions about her role in a scheme to play political favorites with her agency.

If Holder refuses Congress' demand to indict her, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told MailOnline, it's time for him to resign.

'Yes,' he said. 'Absolutely.'

Clash of the titans: Attorney General Eric Holder delivered a 'disrespectful' verbal slap to a Republican congressman last week, said Sen. Mike Lee, and he should apologize

'Absolutely': Sen. Ted Cruz said without hesitation that Holder should resign his office if he refuses to indict former IRS official Lois Lerner following a contempt of Congress resolution in the House

Utah Sen. Mike Lee told MailOnline that Holder deserves a 'mulligan' for his outburst last week, but he first owes congressman Louis Gohmert of Texas a sincere apology

Lerner allegedly orchestrated a plan to prevent the approvals of tax-exempt statuses for conservative tea party groups in the run-up to the 2010 congressional elections. That move hampered their ability to raise funds and participate in the election season with ad-buys and other independent expenditures.

If Holder is the proverbial cat with nine political lives, he's used up eight of them with the GOP. And his appearance last week before the House Judiciary Committee has Cruz's colleague, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, demanding an apology.

The attorney general snapped at Rep. Louie Gohmert during the April 8 hearing when the former Texas chief justice claimed Holder didn't take seriously a 2012 House vote holding him in criminal contempt for clinging to documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal.

'You don't want to go there, buddy,' Holder told him.

On Saturday at the site of the first New Hampshire Freedom Summit in the city of Manchester, Lee told MailOnline that Holder's outburst 'was disrespectful.'

'Now look – everybody makes mistakes. Everyone's entitled to a mulligan now and then,' he said.

'I hope that it was just a mistake. And if it was, then I'm sure Eric Holder should issue an apology.'

But 'it would be much better,' he added, 'if Holder and the Justice Department just complied with the House's requests. They shouldn't go there.'

Contempt: Texas GOP Rep. Louis Gohmert slammed Holder in a House hearing, saying a congressional vote of contempt was apparently 'not a big deal to our attorney general'

Friendly terrtory: The 2014 New Hampshire Freedom Summit was a gathering of tea party-affiliated conservative lawmakers and other potential future candidates, making swag like an anti-Hillary Clinton 'stress ball' popular items

Sen. Rand Paul said Eric Holder should be -- but isn't -- an 'independent' investigator, even though he's an Obama political appointee with loyalty to the White House

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who along with Cruz is seen as a GOP presidential front-runner for 2016, said he understands the tightrope Holder has to walk, even if he doesn't like the result.

Body slam: Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold said during the same Capitol Hill hearing that Holder should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress

'It is a pretty big question' whether congressional subpoenas still have any teeth,' he said.

A U.S. attorney general 'should be an independent agent. That's what they're supposed to be,' Paul told MailOnline. 'But it's hard because he's also a political appointee.'

Should Holder go if he doesn't indict Lerner following a contempt citation from the House?

'I don't know the answer to that,' Paul conceded. 'I really don't know exactly what will happen.'

Lee seconded that note of caution.

'It's going to be a very interesting thing,' the Utahan said. 'I'm watching that one very closely.'

Paul gave Lerner no such leeway, however.

'Lois Lerner was a government employee and is still receiving a government pension. She should cooperate in a government investigation,' he said of her refusal – twice – to answer the House oversight committee's questions.

'Everything should be done to find justice. I think it upsets a lot of people, Republican or Democrat, if government is being used to punish political enemies.'
