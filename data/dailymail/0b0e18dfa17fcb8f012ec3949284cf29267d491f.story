We may like to remember wartime Britons as upstanding, moral folk ruled by the stiff upper lip.

But a new letter shows that, when it came to celebrating at least, they were every bit as debauched as their modern-day equivalents.

Penned after the VE Day celebrations in London, Diana Carnegie's letter describes how couples were openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace as the King and Queen walked out on to the balcony.

Newsreel footage from the time may show the VE celebrations as refined, but a new letter reveals that couples were openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace as the King and Queen took to the balcony

Diana Carnegie, who wrote the letter to her officer husband, also describes how the drunken crowd booed 'boring' members of the cabinet and instead demanded to see Winston Churchill

London's streets were turned into a festival ground as revellers poured on to the street to mark the end of the Second World War in Europe. This picture shows Trafalgar Square

Diana Carnegie recorded how drunken crowds along Whitehall booed speeches by boring members of the cabinet before demanding to see Winston Churchill.

After downing rum and whisky, Diana and her friends joined the jubilant throngs to see Churchill give his famous V for victory salute.

And in her letter to her army officer husband who was away in Europe, she wrote how she ‘ached’ for him and that they would have ‘gone wild and never stopped’ had he been there.

Mrs Carnegie’s account of VE Day is a far cry from the mild, traditional newsreel footage of the event in May 1945.

It is now coming up for sale at auction in an archive relating to her husband James Carnegie, whose father was Sir Lancelot Carnegie, the son of an Earl and a former ambassador of Portugal.

At the end of World War II, James Carnegie was in Germany with the Royal Artillery, leaving his wife and her friends to celebrate at home in London.

In her letter, Diana describes drinking a bottle of whiskey with friends (left) before they had 'quite a good dinner' and then 'stumbled across f*****g couples to the palace where the King and Queen had just been out' (right)

Mrs Carnegie wrote how the group went to the Athenaeum Hotel in Piccadilly for dinner on May 8, 1945 where they had a ‘set-to’ with staff about being allowed in.

She said: 'Eventually they let us all have a rum and orange. We had quite a good dinner and then stumbled across f******g couples in the dark to the Palace where the King and Queen had just been out.

'We decided to go to Whitehall in the hopes of seeing Churchill. The crowds were terrific but we managed to make our way behind a string of sailors.

'Parliament Square was a seething mass. We actually all got on to a jeep but thank heaven - it got so bad we couldn’t move, as otherwise I should have been killed.

Celebrations lasted throughout the day and into the night, but the war continued for another three months

'At that moment (Clement) Atlee (deputy Prime Minister) and co appeared on the balcony so we made a dash and got right in front of the crowd and immediately underneath him.

'We cheered suitably at all points of his ridiculous and boring speech at the same time mentioning we’d like to see Churchill.'

Mrs Carnegie then said how her friends nearly got into a fight with a man who called Churchill a ‘drunk who didn’t give a damn.’

She added: 'That got our blood up and when Atlee had finished (Ernest) Bevin (minister for labour and national service) looking like a revolting gargoyle came to the mike to speak - so we just yelled "we want Churchill" non-stop.

'Quite a lot of the crowd took it up and he never got a word out and had to retire! We were terribly pleased with ourselves.'

In the note Diana describes the moment she and her friends jeered one cabinet minister off the balcony of the Palace with chants of 'we want Churchill' (left), before telling her husband she 'ached' for him to be there (right)

With her spirits up, Mrs Carnegie described how she returned home alone and midnight.

She said: 'Oh darling, you can imagine how I ached for you to be there, it would have been marvellous.

'We’d have gone wild together and never stopped.'

The letter is being sold by Mullocks Auctioneers of Ludlow, Shrops.

Auctioneer Richard Westwood-Brookes said: 'This letter certainly gives a vivid account of what the VE Day celebrations were like and is in contrast to the traditional news footage from the time.

'She makes it clear that there were couples openly having sex outside Buckingham Palace without caring who was watching.

'Somewhat surprsingly for a refined lady in 1945, she used very colourful language and behaved in a very raucous manner.

'Giving a speech to thousands of people would have been one of Bevin’s greatest moments in his career but it never happened because of this lady and her friends.'

The Carnegie archive, that also includes letters between the couple describing the state of the war, is being sold tomorrow with a pre-sale estimate of £500.
