China today launched its first ever extraterrestrial landing craft into orbit in the hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 
years to soft-land a probe on the moon.

The nation is only the third in 
history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the Chang'e-3 device, nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' 
after a Chinese folklore character, set off at 5.30pm on Sunday 
evening (1.30am local time).

The lunar probe blasted off on board an 
enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch 
Center in China's southwestern Sichuan province.

First: This probe is the first time China has sent a spacecraft to soft land on the surface of an extraterrestrial body

Exploring: If all goes well, the probe will conduct surveys on the moon over the course of 90 days

The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour,
 is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus 
Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14.

The
 mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent 
lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15
 years.

President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower, and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off.

If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December.

It is designed to roam the lunar 
surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area
 of about five square kilometres.

Plan: The probe launch is a major step for China's ambitious space programme which includes building a permanent lunar base

Record-breaker: The probe will be the country's first to land on the moon and has been nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit'

It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking 
high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten 
basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago.

The journey of the probe and its final landing will be closely monitored by the European 
Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.

ESA’s own 
launch station in Kourou, French Guiana, will immediately start 
receiving signals from the mission after take-off and it will upload 
commands to the probe on behalf of the Chinese control centre.

'Whether
 for human or robotic missions, international cooperation like this is 
necessary for the future exploration of planets, moons and asteroids, 
benefitting everyone,' said Thomas Reiter, director of ESA’s human 
spaceflight operations.

This will be China's first spacecraft to make a soft landing beyond Earth.

In recent years, China has made considerable progress in its space programme.

History: China will become just the third country in history to soft land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon when 'Jade Rabbit' launches next month.The gold-coloured model has six wheels and wing-like solar panels

Chinese scientists test the moon rover ahead of its launch. The six-wheeled Yutu vehicle began operating last month after making the first soft landing on the moon by a space probe in 37 years

In June, three Chinese astronauts spent 15 days in orbit and docked their craft with an experimental space laboratory.

In 2007, the country despatched an unmanned spacecraft called Chang'e to orbit the Moon.

The craft stayed in space for 16 months before being intentionally crashed on to the Moon's surface.

The name Jade Rabbit was chosen after an online poll in which millions took part.

Ouyang
 Ziyuan, head of the moon rover project, told Xinhua earlier this week 
that the ancient beliefs had their origins in the marks left by impacts 
on the lunar landscape.

'There
 are several black spots on the moon's surface. Our ancient people 
imagined they were a moon palace, osmanthus trees, and a jade rabbit,' 
he said.

China sent its 
first astronaut into space in 2003, becoming the third country after 
Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel 
independently.

The military-backed space programme is a source of national pride.

China
 is one of only three countries to have managed to independently send 
humans into space, the others being Russia and the US.
