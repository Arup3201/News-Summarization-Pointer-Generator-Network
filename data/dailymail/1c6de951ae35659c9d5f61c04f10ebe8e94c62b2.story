Porto right-back Danilo admits he is proud to be linked with Real Madrid, as the European champions step up their interest in the Brazilian right-back.

Although he insists he is fully focused on his current club, Danilo is 'ready' to sit down at the end of the season and discuss his future.

'I'm living a great moment with Porto,' he told Spanish newspaper AS. 'It makes me happy a great club like Madrid is interested in me.

AS leads on Danilo's potential move to Madrid, while Mundo Deportivo focus on Gerard 'Piquembauer' Pique

'When the season ends I'll sit down with Porto and we'll decide what is best for me and them.'

The 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil, alongside current Real Madrid defender Marcelo, who is likely to have an impact on Danilo's decision come the end of the season.

AS report that it will cost Madrid €30million (£22m) to bring Danilo to the Bernabeu. 

Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo's front page leads on Gerard Pique, and his comparison to Bayern Munich and Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer. 

Pique has made the centre-back position his own and is now Barcelona's leader at the heart of defence

Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the best defenders ever to have lived, and the Spanish paper have dubbed Pique 'Piquembauer' on their front page.

'The comeback', reads the headline, as Mundo claim Pique has taken on the challenge and is once again a world-class performer in his position.

The 28-year-old has made 31 appearances in a Barcelona shirt so far this season, and has confirmed his inheritance of the leadership from Puyol at the Nou Camp, 'gaining weight' in the dressing room in the process. 

Marcello Lippi thinks Juventus can win the Champions League (left) while Michel Platini also has kind words

In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport carry an interview with Marcello Lippi, two-time Juventus manager and World Cup-winning coach with Italy.

He claims he can see himself in Massimiliano Allegri, the current Juve manager, and has backed him to win the Champions League this season.

Lippi was in charge of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006 despite being underdogs in Germany, and thinks Juve's situation in Europe is similar.

'In the Champions League he can do like Italy in 2006,' Lippi told La Gazzetta. 'We weren't favourites, but we won.

'Max arrived at Juve at the same age I did, he has my pragmatism.' 

Tuttosport's front page leads on UEFA president Michel Platini, who also has some kind words for his former club Juve.

Aside from the Champions League, they are top of Serie A by 14 points and in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia.

Allegri's side fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Fiorentina in the first leg of their semi-final, but Platini has backed them to make a comeback in the second leg on April 7.

'Juve, this time you can win the cup,' Platini said.
