After hearing the news of Rolf Harris's guilt on sexual abuse charges, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted he was 'gutted and dismayed' and described Harris's actions as 'abhorrent'.

The 84-year-old entertainer was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault against four girls, one of whom was as young as seven or eight.

'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio.

Tony Abbott has described Rolf Harris's crimes as 'utterly abhorrent' and said he was 'gutted' to hear of his guilty sentence

'Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime,' Mr Abbott said.

'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.'

The assaults took place in the UK between 1968 and 1986, with the main complainant a childhood friend of Harris's daughter Bindi.

Harris was also found guilty of assaulting Australian woman Tonya Lee at a London pub in 1986 when she was 15.

Now, Rolf Harris faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen and will lose his BAFTA fellowship following his convictions for indecent assault.

In an astonishing fall from grace for the man who painted the Queenâ€™s portrait and sang at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Buckingham Palace is now likely to revoke his Order of the British Empire and Officer of the Order of Australia.

On Monday Harris, 84, was told he faced an 'inevitable' jail term after he was found guilty of 12 indecent assaults on four victims between 1968 and 1986, often in 'plain sight'.

'Jekyll and Hyde' Harris had used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity and believed his celebrity status made him believe 'he was above the law', Scotland Yard said.

The Australian star spent 16 years abusing his daughter Bindi's best friend and got a 'thrill' from attacking her when his own child was feet away.

He is likely to be jailed at his sentencing on Friday, and could face up to a 24 year sentence.
