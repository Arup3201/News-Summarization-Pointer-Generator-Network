Hurrah, the Seventies are back! This season’s clothes couldn’t have been a bigger throwback for me when I opened one of the fashion magazines this month.

From the fringing to the pretty Bohemian dresses and floppy hats, I remember it all the first time round, when I was a successful model who travelled around the world on fashion shoots for adverts and magazines.

My favourite items in the Seventies were the sweet, flowing dresses I might have worn when at Glastonbury. I was very much a flower power kind of girl, and still adore wearing bright colours. But now, at 75, can I really do the same trends the second time round?

Obviously things are different now — back then I would wear padded knickers and bras to give my slight frame added curves, but now I look for more flattering cuts to shape my curves.

Here, I try out six of the new Seventies styles to see if a woman in her 70s can get away with them this time...

DENIM THROWBACK

I had a skirt exactly like this one! And a blouse, which I would have knotted at the waist. I might have styled it with a belt, jacket and hat, and my hair would have been worn loose or scrunched on top of my head in a top knot.

LEOPARD LOVE-IN 

This dress is a little bit shorter than I usually go for. But when paired with an over-the-knee boot, it’s surprisingly sophisticated. I have a pair of boots like this that are over 30 years old, but I still wear them and love them just as much. Back then I could get away with wearing it with court shoes, but there’s no doubt boots are more flattering now as they hide the leg.

THE ULTIMATE GILET

This is a lovely look, and the faux-fur gilet is fantastic. I would very happily wear this out and about. This type of Bohemian glamour looks gorgeous, and the gilet will smooth over any lumps and bumps you might rather were hidden when you get to my age.

WEAR ANYWHERE DRESS

As TV’s Green Goddess, I have an entire wardrobe of green. I find it fascinating that this length is coming back into fashion, too. It’s very elegant and I love  the sleeves. The fringed bag is giving me major feelings of deja vu, too. Back then, I might have paired a wicker basket with this dress but now it’s always a handbag.

Bag, £99, clarks.co.uk

DAY-TO-NIGHT GLAMOUR

This look is pure Margaret Thatcher, who came to power in 1979. White trousers are one of the easiest routes to easy glamour. Back then, women would have worn pussybow blouses with a suit or something more elegant if they were going out in the evening. I would have worn something bright with these trousers, but I love this blouse.

Blouse, £125, and trousers, £129, reiss.com 

Shoes, £250, available from February 4 at lkbennett.com

PAISLEY PERFECT

Now this is a dress I might have worn at Glastonbury, with flip flops and a floppy hat. It’s nice that this modern one is high-waisted as it’s good to have a bit of a defined silhouette now I’m older.

Dress, £38, glamorous.com
