'They would see this as a declaration of war by Australia.'

With those words, one of the country's best military minds has said what the politicians have been careful to avoid saying.

Professor Clive Williams is one of Australia's pre-eminent voices on military intelligence and he says the militant fighters in Iraq and Syria who saw the Americans as a direct enemy to attack, 'now see us as the enemy too'. 

'They (Islamic State militants) will see this as a declaration of war by Australia' Professor Clive Williams. 'They now see us as the enemy, just as they have the United States'

In announcing the deployment of 600 defence personnel to the Middle East, the Prime Minister warned the operation could take 'many months'

He has also cast serious doubt on the involvement of the air force.

'We must remember that these terrorists are not easily visible, in fact they are embedded within the towns and villages and amongst civilians,' Professor Williams said.

'I am not sure what we are doing there with FA-18s, the targets are very small. You can't bomb them so I don't see how they can mount air strikes effectively.'

Prime Minister Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis have been at pains to emphasise that Australia will be part of an international coalition and the deployment does not mean Australia was at war nor will there be combat troops on the ground.

The PM says the measure of success is 'if ISIL is dislodged, if the Iraqi government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security'

'If ISIL is dislodged, if the Iraqi government is once again reasonably capable of maintaining control of its own territory maintaining internal security, that will certainly be a success,' Mr Abbott said.

'You may well see the air element leave by the end of the week and some of the special forces may well leave before then.'

It's believed the elite SAS members could be on their way as early as Wednesday. 

But according to Senator Brandis the decision is simply to 'pre-position Australian forces in the UAE in the event that Australia decides to commit to a multi-national, essentially humanitarian force, to deal with the ISIL insurgency in northern Iraq'.

'We are involved in war-like operations. If we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time. We need a clearly defined mission, go in, achieve it and then get out,' says Independent MP Andrew Wilkie

Independent MP Andrew Wilkie says 'these are semantics really, we are involved in war-like operations'.

'We helped start a war 11 and a half years ago based on a litany of lies. We started a war which continues to this day, so what in fact what we are dealing with today is in part our own making.

'They (IS) are wanting to draw us into this war .. and we are being drawn in. We have to be very mindful of mission creep, if we are not careful we could still be doing this in 10 years time.

'We need a clearly defined mission, go in, achieve it and then get out,' Mr Wilkie said.

Senator Brandis (left) says the decision taken by Cabinet was to 'pre-position Australian forces in the UAE in the event that Australia decides to commit to a multi-national, essentially humanitarian force, to deal with the ISIL insurgency in northern Iraq'. Professor Williams (right) claims 'this is alliance politics on our behalf'

Prof Williams thinks there is little chance Australian combat troops will be required, even if the operation is drawn out.

'We will train and advise, like we've done previously in Iraq,' he added.

'This is alliance politics on our behalf.'

But, equally, he is not confident a successful mission against the Islamic State terrorists if the ground battle is left to local military forces.

'If you really wanted to effectively deal with the terror threat you would have to deal with the Assad regime in Syria and lean on both Saudi Arabia and Qatar - and the US is not going to do that.'

Further, he said, was the Iraqi national army 'isn't worth much at all and is not motivated'.

'On the other hand, the Kurdish fighters are very motivated but not very capable.'  

Prof Williams has been at the helm of terrorism and national security courses since leaving Defence more than a decade ago.

Of greater concern, he says, is the impact Australia's decision to commit military forces to Iraq has had in Indonesia.

Not very confident of success. Professor Clive Williams says bombing the so-called Islamic State terror group is not an option and local forces are not strong enough or capable of forcing the militants out

'Terrorism specialists there have made it clear that the chatter in Indonesia has now turned to attacking westerners,' Prof Williams added.

The Islamic State terror groups grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq 'which we never effectively dealt with, we never hit them with the killer punch'.

Latest figures have those working with IS numbering 31,000 across Syria and northern Iraq.

'It's now attracting a lot more people. 2000 have pledged there allegiance in recent days across Indonesia.

'Intelligence shows that just six months ago these groups (in Syria and Iraq) numbered about 12,000, so support has grown considerably,' he said.

Mr Wilkie says we are now facing increased terrorist threats because of this decision.

'Every time we interfere in the Middle East we become more of a target,' he said.

'Clearly we are pre-positioning for what is coming next.' 

600 Australian defence personnel will be sent to the UAE ahead of likely deployment into Iraq as part of a multi-national operation against 'Islamic State' militants

Unlike other missions, the Federal Government has promised there will be 'no combat troops' on the ground in Iraq but SAS troops are believed to be preparing to leave, perhaps as early as Wednesday

The Independent MP has called on the government to reveal its forward plans.

'Clearly they had (made decisions) some weeks ago and they made announcements now,' he said.

'They are now saying we are only pre-positioning, that's exactly what they said 11 and a half years ago, we were only pre-positioning and no decisions had been made about going to war.

'We are doing what the enemy would like us to do. We must have a very clearly defined mission, apply the resources needed to achieve that mission and then get out.'

'This is a problem for the world and that is why we in Australia are engaged, we need to be engaged, it affects particularly the Western world,' Senator Brandis said.

As Australia prepares to deploy its forces, it's expected new counter-terror laws will be tabled in parliament, perhaps as early next week. They will all but prohibit travel to countries like Syria and Iraq, which are areas now designated as terrorism hubs.
