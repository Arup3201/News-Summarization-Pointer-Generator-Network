A police officer at the heart of the Plebgate affair boasted she could bring down the Government, it emerged last night.

The explosive claim was made by one of those who barred former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell from riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street.

The female constable is said to have texted her friends after the incident became public, telling them: ‘I can topple the Tory Government.’

Details of
 the message were revealed last night in a letter sent by Mr Mitchell to
 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe following a 
wave of disciplinary hearings against officers involved in the affair.

It
 provides the clearest evidence yet to support Tory suspicions  that Mr 
Mitchell was targeted by officers as part of a politically motivated 
campaign.

The woman, who is thought to have been sacked for her role in the affair, also texted friends saying: ‘The Fed need our help.’ 

The
 message appears to be a reference to the Police Federation, which was 
fighting a high-profile campaign against Government reforms and which 
exploited the ‘Plebgate’ row for maximum effect.

Mr
 Mitchell writes: ‘Officers on duty were colluding with the Police 
Federation to fan the flames for political reasons, as shown by the 
text/email exchange, saying, “The Fed need our help”. ’ 

The affair erupted after Mr Mitchell was stopped from riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street in September 2012.

A
 leaked ‘police log’ claimed that Mr Mitchell called officers ‘****ing 
plebs’. He later admitted swearing in their presence but always denied 
using the toxic word ‘pleb’. He later quit his job over the row.

Three
 officers have now been sacked for their role in the affair and one – PC
 Keith Wallis – was jailed after pleading guilty to misconduct in a 
public office. A fourth misconduct case is now under way.

Mr Mitchell has asked for full transcripts of the hearings, the publication of text messages and other contact between officers, as well as the release of further CCTV footage (pictured) from the incident in central London

Mr
 Mitchell’s letter, a copy of which has been seen by the Daily Mail, 
raises concerns that the Met has held its disciplinary hearings behind 
closed doors.

He
 says the row has ‘badly damaged’ public confidence in the police, 
adding: ‘I am deeply concerned that the disciplinary hearings were held 
in private and were not open to public and journalistic scrutiny. In my 
view it is in the public interest that it is all put in the public 
domain.’

Mr
 Mitchell, who has attended the disciplinary hearings, said he had been 
‘extremely surprised at the facts that were revealed about the actions 
of numerous police officers before, during and after the incident.’

Mr
 Mitchell is suing The Sun, which broke the story, for libel, which the 
paper denies.

Mr Mitchell, in turn, is being sued for libel by PC Toby 
Rowland, who claimed to be on the receiving end of the Tory MP’s alleged
 verbal attack.

A
 Met spokesman said regulations prevented it revealing the details of 
the misconduct hearings but the force would publish a report about the 
Plebgate inquiry and summaries of each of the misconduct hearings.
