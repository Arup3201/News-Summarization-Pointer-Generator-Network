The unemployment rate rose slightly to 8.3 per cent last month as the number of job-seekers grew by 45,000, according to statistics released by the Labor Department today.

Faced with the bad news for the economy, President Obama was today forced to admit that there are too many people out of work and vowed to do more on their behalf.

However he also pointed to the continued growth of the private sector, which created 163,000 new jobs in July - the most in five months .

Mitt Romney and Republicans jumped on the figures calling them a 'hammer blow' to middle class families as the new jobs failed to offset a growing number of Americans out of work.

High unemployment could dash President Obama's re-election hopes as no president since World War II has faced a re-election campaign with unemployment over 8 per cent.

The stock market has reacted positively to the news with stocks surging - as economists had predicted only 100,000 jobs would be added in July.

Stocks rose sharply in midday trading. The 
Dow Jones industrial average added 247 points to 13,126, while the 
broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 28 points to 1,393.

Romney says Americans deserve better than an unemployment rate that stays stubbornly stuck above 8 per cent.

The unemployment rate has risen because number of people who classified as unemployed - over-16s actively looking for a job - rose by 45,000 while the size of the workforce shrank.

However it is not known exactly what factors caused the ratio of unemployed Americans to increase.

'We've now gone 42 consecutive months with the unemployment rate above 8 per cent,' Romney said in a statement. 'Middle-class Americans deserve better, and I believe America can do better.'

He says Obama 'doesn't have a plan' for boosting growth and his lackadaisical efforts have caused the once flourishing country to flounder.

'My plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with twelve million new jobs created by the end of my first term,' Romney said.

In contrast, Obama told voters in Florida that his rival favors 'trickle-down tax cut fairy dust' that has failed to fix the economy in 
the past.

Romney's plan for job growth 
included several broad ideas but few specifics. He said he would help 
small business owners, cut spending to reduce the deficit and cut taxes.

Obama
sought this week to draw a contrast with Romney on taxes, saying the 
Republican's call for extending cuts for upper-income earners would mean
higher tax bills for the middle class.

The president's new television 
ad made the case with a highly personalized message: Romney has paid a 
lower proportion of his income in taxes than many people of lesser 
means.

Obama planned to hammer his tax message
again on Friday by calling on Congress to extend tax cuts for families 
making less than $250,000 a year before those cuts expire at the end of 
the year.

The president wants to end the tax cuts, first enacted under 
President George W. Bush, for families making more than $250,000.

While
the overall race for the White House remains deadlocked, several polls 
show Romney with an advantage over Obama on economic issues.

A USA 
Today/Gallup Poll conducted in late July found 50 per cent of Americans 
said Romney is the candidate who would be better at job creation, with 
44 per cent siding with Obama.

White House economist Alan Krueger said Friday's report was evidence that the economy is recovering. 

'It is critical that we continue the policies that build an economy that works for the middle class as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007,' Krueger said.

There was a silver lining in the new report, as U.S. employers added 163,000 jobs in July, a modest increase that could not combat the growing unemployment.

The economy has added an average of 151,000 jobs a month this year, 
roughly the same as last year's pace.

The majority of jobs were added to professional and business services sectors, food services and drinking establishments as well as manufacturing.

Employment in professional and business services increased by 49,000 in July and computer systems design added 7,000 jobs.

In the leisure and hospitality industry, employment in food services and drinking establishments rose by 29,000 over the month and by 292,000 over the past 12 months.

Manufacturing employment rose in July (+25,000), with nearly all of the increase in durable goodsmanufacturing.

Within durable goods, the motor vehicles and parts industry had fewer seasonal layoffsthan is typical for July, contributing to a seasonally adjusted employment increase of 13,000. Employment continued to trend up in fabricated metal products (+5,000).

July's hiring was the best since February.

Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics (10.3 per cent) decreased in July, while the rates for adult men (7.7 per cent), adult women (7.5 per cent),teenagers (23.8 per cent), whites (7.4 per cent), and blacks (14.1 per cent) showed little or no change.

In July, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks and over) was little changed at 5.2 million.

These individuals accounted for 40.7 per cent of the unemployed.

But 2.5 million Americans were found to be 'marginally attached to the labor force,' which means they were not working, they wanted a job and were available for work. That number has decreased since last year, when the number was 2.8 million.

There were also less 'discouraged workers' from last year, which are persons not currently looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. 

There were 267,000 less this year than last year.

The growth was not able to outpace the job losses, however, and many pundits predict that a growing dissatisfaction with how Obama has steered the economy will be a major blow in November.
