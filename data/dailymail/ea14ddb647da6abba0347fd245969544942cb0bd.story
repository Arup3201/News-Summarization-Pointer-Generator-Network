Liverpool target Dele Alli has signed a new contract with MK Dons.

The midfielder - who was born in Milton Keynes and made his debut for the club aged 16 - has attracted the interest of England's top clubs and was part of the MK Dons' side that beat Manchester United 4-0 in the Capital One Cup.

Liverpool put in a £3.5million bid – rising to £8m – for Alli earlier this summer but the 18-year-old has extended his stay at MK Dons until 2017.

'Dele is an exceptionally gifted player and it was only right that we rewarded him for a fantastic 12 months with this new deal,' MK Dons boss Karl Robinson said in a statement.

'Dele will continue to be linked with some of the world's biggest clubs and it's inevitable that there will be a time when we will have to let him go, whether that be in January, next summer or whenever.

'However, for the time being, he remains an MK Dons player and we'll continue to enjoy watching him progress week-in, week-out here at stadiumMK. 

'Dele remains fully focused on playing for this club and we remain just as committed to him and his development.'

Alli said he was delighted to have extended his stay at his home club and that he is concentrated on performing for MK Dons, despite widespread interest in his services.

'This came as a bit of surprise but I'm thankful to the manager, the chairman and the club for this new deal and I hope to repay everyone on the pitch.

'My focus is solely on playing for the Dons. I'm a Milton Keynes boy so I couldn't be happier representing my local team. I'm playing regularly in the first team as well which will only stand me in good stead for the future.

'I love this club and it would be a dream to help take them to the next level. Hopefully we can continue this strong start to the season, starting with Crewe on Saturday.'

MK Dons are currently fourth in League One after seven matches, equal on points with Bradford and Sheffield United in the other play-off positions. They face last-placed Crewe at the weekend.
