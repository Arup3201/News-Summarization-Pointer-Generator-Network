A shell-shocked war veteran today avoided jail after claiming memories of the battlefield triggered him to roar along a motorway at 140mph.

Liam Farnworth, 24, who has served as a driver in Afghanistan and Iraq, used his army training to drive off at high speed, a court heard.

He was said to have mistakenly thought a police patrol following him in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were two masked thugs.

The plain clothes police officers were in an unmarked car and spotted Farnworth as he initially drove at up to 85mph in a 40mph zone.

But as they began following him, Farnworth feared they were ‘men in hoodies’ and roared away as if he were ‘shaking off the enemy’ in battle.

Even when the officers turned on their blue lights, Farnworth failed to stop, turning onto the M61 motorway heading towards Manchester.

He weaved in and out of traffic at up to 140mph in a Nissan 350Z he borrowed from a friend before the dumping the vehicle and running off.

Farnworth often used high speed skills to escape the enemy pursuing him in conflicts overseas and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

He admitted dangerous driving and was today given a community order for 12 months after video footage of the chase was played to a judge.

He was also sentenced to a supervision order for 12 months, banned from driving for 12 months and must take a driving re-test.

Passing sentence today at Preston Crown Court, Mr Recorder Michael Murray said he could have been jailed for many years had anyone died.

'It seems to me at the time you were 
suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder. Some members of the public might have sympathy but that in itself cannot be an excuse for driving like you did'

Mr Recorder Michael Murray

He told the court: ‘You drove a high powered car at a rigorously high speed and you drove the car dangerously on the M61 and also on various residential roads in Bolton.

‘I saw the police footage and it speaks for itself. Fortunately no-one was injured and no property had been damaged - had there been any it would be more likely than not you would be going to prison today.

‘If you had actually killed someone, you would have expected many years imprisonment.

‘It seems to me at the time you were suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder brought about by your experiences as a serving soldier overseas.

‘Some members of the public might have sympathy but that in itself cannot be an excuse for driving like you did. There very easily could have been a catastrophic accident at those sort of speeds.’

Earlier the court watched a recording of the pursuit, filmed from the officers’ car.

It showed how Farnworth left the motorway at Junction 5 and sped on to Wigan Road before reaching Hunger Hill and turning into Bolton Road.

'He did not realise at first that the men in the car behind him were police officers. His army training kicked in, for want of a better phrase, and he panicked and did what he did'

David Ryan, defending

Then he turned into Winslow Road, where he abandoned the car without putting on the handbrake.

The vehicle rolled away and crashed causing £1,000 worth of damage to its bumper, and Farnworth was caught by police after they chased him on foot.

At an earlier hearing, David Ryan, defending, told the court that Farnworth had left the army in June, 2010, after serving for six years.

He had received extensive driver training whilst in the forces, and on occasions had used his skills to escape whilst being chased by the enemy.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder following very stressful or frightening events.

It can be seen in people after military combat, serious road accidents, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, being held hostage or witnessing serious assaults.

Sufferers often relive the event through nightmares - and can feel isolated, irritably or guilty.

They can also suffer from sleeping problems or have difficulty in concentrating.

‘He has, on several occasions, had to flee from incidents of conflict,’ Mr Ryan said.

But he added that, due to things he had witnessed and experienced in the army, Farnworth now suffers from post-traumatic stress.

Mr Ryan said: ‘He did not realise at first that the men in the car behind him were police officers.

'His army training kicked in, for want of a better phrase, and he panicked and did what he did.

‘He didn’t know who they were and he panicked and put his foot down. He believes himself that he was in full control of the vehicle at all times.’

Farnworth, of Horwich, who now works as HGV driver for a vehicle dealership, was said to be ‘deeply ashamed’ of his behaviour.

The court heard he had six weeks of psychotherapy and can soon be discharged back into the care of his GP.
