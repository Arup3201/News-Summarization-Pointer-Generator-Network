Parents are outraged that a registered sex offender was allowed to play at a school concert.  

Melissa Salsbury, who also models as Mia Rose, performed during assembly at Kiona-Benton City High School in Benton City, Washington on Tuesday.

She was part of group, A.N.E./Money over Misery, which aims to share positive messages about bullying, peer pressure and self-worth. 

Salsbury, however, was convicted in 2011 and imprisoned for almost a year for forcing underage girls into prostitution. She was placed on the sex offenders' register.

Melissa Salsbury, who also goes by the modelling name Mia Rose, turned herself into police after performing at a high school with her band despite being on the sex offenders' registry

Police heard on Tuesday that Salsbury had been at the school.

Benton County Sheriff’s Detective Mike Wilson told Tri-City Herald that Salsbury turned herself into police on Wednesday.  

The school district apologized to angry parents and students for the situation, adding that Salsbury had not been cleared to perform there.

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment on Friday from A.N.E., but it appeared that her fellow band members were unaware Salsbury was a convicted sex offender. 

In a YouTube message on Thursday, the group said: 'Yes it was a negative incident that took place a couple of years ago and that is still held over that individual's head but we are here to spread a positive message. We are here to spread positive hip-hop.'

They added: 'We don't condone the incidents that took place a few years ago and we want everyone to know we didn't have any knowledge of that.'

In 2011, Salsbury was jailed for 300 days for forcing underage girls to have sex with men, the Tri-City Herald reported.

A registered sex offender was among the performers at a motivational assembly Tuesday at Kiona-Benton City High School in Washington. The school district apologized to outraged parents for not completing a background check

Salsbury, then 20 and having just given birth to her son, pleaded guilty to a felony of promoting commercial sexual abuse of a minor.

She was given a reduced sentence due to her full cooperation with police which led to the convictions of five others, including her husband. 

It was also noted that Salsbury had been forced into stripping and prostitution when she was a minor and was reportedly told she would be traded into the sex slave industry if she didn't cooperate.  

According to the local news outlet, Salsbury recruited 17 and 18-year-old high school girls in 2010 telling them they would be paid to dance. 

Salsbury put ads on a classifieds website and then when contacted by johns would rent rooms at a Kennewick hotel and force girls into sex with the men. 

She threatened the girls by telling them she would tell their parents or boyfriends, and that they would be traded into sex slavery. She kept profits from the prostitution, according to reports from the time.

She was caught and the prostitution ring discovered when one emotionally distressed girl broke down to a school teacher.
