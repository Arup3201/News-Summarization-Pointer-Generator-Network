Home alone at the White House, Barack Obama headed on an impromptu Christmas shopping trip with first dog Bo today - making the most of his free time as Congress remained in stalemate over payroll tax cuts for next year.

The President's wife and daughters are already on the family's annual vacation in Hawaii - a trip which has attracted scathing criticism for its estimated cost of $4million, funded by the American taxpayer.

Obama is expected to fly to Hawaii in the next few days for his luxury vacation in a private beachfront villa. The alone time gave him the chance to pick up some cost-saving items in front of the cameras at PetSmart and Best Buy in Alexandria, Virginia - before indulging in pizza for lunch.

At the pet store, Obama bought Bo
 a $24.99 toy bone and a bag of treats, as the dog played with a 
poodle puppy named Cinnamon.

'OK, Bo, don't get too personal,' Obama told the family pet as the two dogs sniffed around each other.

The President then headed to Best Buy to shop for his daughters, Malia, 13, and ten-year-old Sasha. He purchased two $50 iTunes gift cards and two games – the Sims 3: Pets and Just Dance 3 for the Wii.

He told reporters: 'If you're wondering – Just Dance for the Wii. The girls beat me every time on these various dance games. So you'll never get a picture of me doing it because I get graded F every time.'

Obama spent around $190 and put it on a credit card, remarking to store employees: 'It'll be really embarrassing if it doesn't go through.'

Obama then went to Del Ray Pizzeria and picked up three pies to go, stopping on the way back to the White House to wish onlookers happy holidays and pose for photographs with children.

The commander-in-chief looked glad of the break from the stalemate in Congress over taxes and unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.

The Republican-led House earlier rejected a short-term deal passed by Democrats and fellow Republicans in the Senate over the weekend and called for fresh negotiations on the expiring tax break that saves the average American worker $1,000 a year.

As both sides dug more deeply into entrenched positions, House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, demanded Obama order Senate Democrats back into session to haggle over a year-long extension.

And even among the happy shoppers, Obama encountered criticism over the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline he has delayed.

John Passacantando, 50, of Alexandria
 said: 'I just said I disagreed with him on the pipeline but I love what
 he's doing for the country otherwise.'

Another
 group invited the President to an office holiday party at their 
Internet development company but he regretfully declined.

Michelle Obama also proved herself a 
fan of the favourite stores of middle America when she made an 
'impromptu' trip to Target in October. Dressed down in yoga pants, a 
baseball cap and floral shirt, the First Lady picked up dog food and 
cleaning products.

However
 the 40-minute run for errands was dismissed as a publicity stunt to 
portray her as an 'ordinary mom' at the beginning of her husband's 
re-election battle.

Heading home: The president took some time out for the stalemate over taxes in Congress

Wearing a Nike cap and sunglasses, the usually glamorous mother 
walked in through the main entrance with just one assistant, an unknown 
female aide.

Secret Service officers reportedly swept the store on Highway 1, 30 minutes before Mrs Obama popped in to carry out her housewife duties. Unlike his wife's 'low-key' visit, the President's trip today was accompanied by scores of photographers and he was flanked by his secret service agents and team of White House staffers.

The Obamas will be reunited when the President joins his wife and daughters on Hawaii where he was born for their Christmas vacation.

Michelle, Malia and Sasha flew to Hawaii for a 17-day holiday on December 16. The separate flights will incur costs of more than $100,000 to the taxpayer.

Time to relax: The Obamas have attracted criticism for the length - and expense - of their family vacations, pictured last year in Hawaii

The president's family covers the cost of a private beach front residence in Kailua, Oahu, for the vacation - a ‘Winter White House’ that costs up to $3,500 a day, or $75,000 a month.

But the local and federal taxpayers help pay the bill for travel and security.

But taxpayers take care of housing for Secret Service, Coast Guard and Navy Seals who guard the rentals and arrive a day ahead of Mr Obama.

That is about $21,600 per home for approximately seven houses rented for 18 days. There is also a hotel bill for $72,216.
