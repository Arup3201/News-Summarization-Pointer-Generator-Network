When David Bowie sang about green eyes in his eighties song, Cat People, he probably didn't realise that years later his own eyes would be compared to those of a feline.

But it appears that Bowie shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to Speedy - a white domestic cat from Norfolk, Virginia, U.S.

Speedy, who has one green and one gold eye, was born with a feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that also occurs in some other animals.

The condition most commonly affects white-coloured cats but may be found in a cat of any colour, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene.Â 

Mismatched: Speedy was born with bi-coloured eyes - one is blue and the other is gold. She has a feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that also occurs in some other animals

It appears that Bowie shares similarly mismatched colour eyes to Speedy - a white domestic cat from Norfolk, Virginia, U.S.

But Bowie's different colour eyes are the result of being punched at secondary school, by a school friend.

The impact tore the sphincter muscles in Bowie's left eye and although he had several operations, his pupil remains permanently open.

This causes the eye to look like it is a darker colour, but it is actually the same shade.

Lorraine Hudgins took the photographs of odd-eyed Speedy as she kept her company at her desk.

Mrs Hudgins said: 'She belongs to the owners of the print shop where I work as a graphic designer.

'I took some photos of her playing with my computer mouse while she was helping me out with my work.

'She's a sweet tempered cat that loves attention - when she's not curled up in a corner asleep.'

Speedy is also deaf, but Lorraine and Speedy's owners say she copes well nonetheless.

Feline friendly: Speedy, who is deaf, belongs to the owner of a print shop and Lorraine Hudgins took this snap of the white cat when she came and sat next on her desk while she worked
