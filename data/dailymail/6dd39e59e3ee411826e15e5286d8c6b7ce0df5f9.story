A New York EMT is accused of killing his estranged wife by strangling her then setting her home on fire with her in it.

The 2008 inferno in Narrowsburg that left Catherine Novak dead was originally written off as a tragic accident. But, last September, Paul Novak's former girlfriend told police that he had confessed to her that he had murdered the mother of his children.

Novak, 45, and a fellow EMT, Scott Sherwood, 40, who allegedly helped him follow through with his plot, are now charged with murder and their trial is expected to begin in July.

Michelle La France went to Sullivan County police with the information after she found out Novak had been cheating on her last fall.

Soon after, detectives arrested Mr Sherwood, who had worked with Mr Novak for years as a state-certified EMT out of Jamaica Hospital in New York, and he confessed to everything before later recanting it, according to The New York Post.

According to court documents obtained by the newspaper, Mr Sherwood told police he drove to Mr Novak and Ms La France's Long Island home on the night Novak died, with the specific purpose of driving Novak upstate so he could kill his wife.

He said the men left behind their cell phones and that Mr Novak told him he had mixed up chloroform to make Ms Novak pass out.

When he asked why Mr Novak planned to kill his wife, Mr Sherwood recalled him say 'so he wouldn't end up like me,' broke and divorced and forced to 'work 80 hours a week and be miserable.' 

When they approached the house, Mr 
Sherwood said Mr Novak had him roll the car into nearby woods and told 
him to wait there as he walked towards the home. He returned an hour 
later.

'Paul
told me in the car that he went into the basement of the house and 
disconnected something to make Catherine come down to the basement,' Mr 
Sherwood confessed, according to The Post.

'He then attempted to make her pass out with the chloroform, but she resisted. He stated that he had to strangle her when it didn’t work. Paul said that Catherine passed out and then he set the house on fire by breaking a gas line.

'Paul stated that Catherine asked him why he was doing this, and he said that he told her it was for the kids.'

Mr Novak is charged with first and second degree murder grand larceny and arson. He is also accused of fraudulently collecting fire and life insurance as the proceeds of murder. Mr Sherwood, who the prosecution say was paid for his help, is charged with second-degree murder.

Ms La France, who allegedly had a fractious relationship with Ms Novak, is now the star witness for the prosecution.

But the defense is confident a lack of evidence means they have a strong case.

Sources for the defense told The Post there is no physical evidence of strangulation and that their client could not have committed the crime in the time frame laid out because it takes at least three hours to travel between Long Island and Narrowsburg.

They claim Ms La France is simply a scorned former lover who wants to ruin Mr Novak's life and that the married couple were in the process of amicably resolving their divorce when the devastating fire occurred.
