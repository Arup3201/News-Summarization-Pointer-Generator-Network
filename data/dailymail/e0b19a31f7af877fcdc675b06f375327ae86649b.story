The European Commission president has compared Britain’s membership of the EU to a doomed love affair – and suggested it might be time to call it a day.

Jean-Claude Juncker publicly floated the idea of a British exit for the first time, and warned David Cameron that he will not be ‘grovelling’ for the UK to stay during future negotiations.

In Paris this weekend, Mr Juncker said: ‘People shouldn’t stay together if conditions aren’t the same as when things started. It’s easy to fall in love and more difficult to stay together.’

The arch federalist, who is an advocate of ‘ever closer union’ within Europe, said that he would reject any attempt to change the EU treaties in order for Britain to restrict free movement of people within the 28 member states.

His comments will come as a blow to the Prime Minister, who has promised to renegotiate Britain’s membership ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017 if his party wins the election.

It is likely it will be possible to reach an agreement in some areas, such as lengthening the time migrants have to live and work in this country before claiming benefits.

But Mr Juncker dashed calls from Conservatives who wish to put a stop to large-scale migration from eastern Europe, saying it was a ‘red line’ issue.

Significant boost: Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) said  that Mr Juncker had made it ‘crystal clear there will be no change to the EU doctrine of free movement and mass immigration’

‘When one mentioned the end of the free circulation of workers, there can be no debate, dialogue or compromise,’ he said. ‘We can fight against abuses, but the EU won’t change the treaties to satisfy the whim of certain politicians.’

His remarks are a significant boost to Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who last night told The Daily Telegraph that Mr Juncker had made it ‘crystal clear there will be no change to the EU doctrine of free movement and mass immigration’.

Mr Cameron is due to meet with other European leaders next month to discuss the growing crisis involving the euro. 

He is expected to use that encounter to lay out some of the areas he wishes to renegotiate to suit Britain better.

Mr Juncker, whose recent appointment as the president of the Commission Mr Cameron had tried to block, has previously warned that he is ‘not frightened’ of national leaders.

He has also attacked plans unveiled by the Prime Minister last month that would deny European immigrants access to tax credits and social housing until they had lived in Britain for at least four years – saying that it was discriminatory.

And Mr Juncker warned the powerful City of London in December that ‘if you question the free movement of workers, Great Britain has to know that one day the free movement of capital will also be called into question’.

If Mr Cameron wins a second term, gaining the support of other member states will be key to agreeing reforms of the EU in Britain’s favour.

However Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, has also signalled that she will not allow any changes on the issue of free movement.
