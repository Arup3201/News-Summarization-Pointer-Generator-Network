It should come as no surprise that Joe Simpson appears wise beyond his years. The 26-year-old Wasps scrum-half speaks with the air of a man twice his age after a year of ‘emotional turmoil’ following the tragically premature death of his 58-year-old mother Brigid, who passed away last January after a six-month battle with skin cancer.

That Simpson has come through as a calm and reflective man, and happens to be playing the best rugby of his life,  is testament to him and the club.

‘Last season was tough,’ Simpson said. ‘It was an emotionally draining year. She sacrificed so much for me, driving me all over the country from the age of 10, to club games and to England camps. Some of the locations were far from glamorous and I remember her standing watching in the pouring rain, all wrapped up. My family have always been incredibly supportive.’

After his mum died, Simpson was grateful for the presence of rugby in his life. ‘Rugby was a brilliant distraction for me,’ he said. ‘The coaches, the owner and every single member of staff were magnificent. They let me take as much time off as I wanted after Mum died but I didn’t want to take time off. I’m a rugby player. It’s what I do.

‘Being around the guys, I could temporarily forget things out on the training pitch. The support I received will stay with me. It meant a lot to me at a time when I was feeling pretty low.

‘I’ve come back feeling fresh and I’m loving my rugby and being part of the rejuvenation of this club on and off the pitch. I’m over the moon with how things are going for me.’

Simpson, one of a core group of Wasps players who refused to jump ship when the club went through financial instability two seasons ago, was owed some loyalty from the side he supported as a lad growing up near their Acton training ground in West London.

With huge investment, a move to Coventry’s Ricoh Arena and an ambitious recruitment drive under way, Simpson’s outstanding form at No 9 is a reflection of the club’s health.

‘The players that (director of rugby) Dai Young has brought in have gelled with the existing players and you’re able to see that in the results,’ Simpson added. ‘We’re not the finished product, we still have a way to go, but it’s a very healthy place to play, train and be part of. I’m playing the best rugby of my career.

‘I’m bossing the matches more effectively without losing that dangerous edge with the ability to snap up tries here and there and utilise my finishing and my pace. That’s something I love to bring to the game because it sets me apart from other No 9s.’

On Saturday night at The Stoop, Simpson goes head to head with England scrum-half Danny Care, the man he replaced in the 2011 World Cup squad after Care suffered a foot injury in the warm-up game against Wales. Simpson’s solitary cap in the pool win over Georgia seems a long time ago.

Wasps coach Dai Young has overseen a difficult period for the club following their move to Coventry 

It is not inconceivable that his club form could see a return in time for this year’s World Cup. A strong show against Care in a must-win European game for both clubs would do his chances no harm, four days before Stuart Lancaster names his Six Nations squad.

‘Playing for England is why you play rugby,’ said Simpson, who racked up his 150th game for Wasps against Bath last Saturday. ‘I’ve already had the experience of being around the squad for a few years and being in autumn and Six Nations squads. I’ve been capped and been to a World Cup and that’s where I want to be. There’s no bigger stage.

‘I haven’t spoken to the England coaches. I’m just trying to keep my head down here and carry on doing what I’m doing.

‘My all-round game is at a peak and I want to keep improving until my mid-30s. I feel like I can offer something to England and I’d love to be given the opportunity. It’s about me maintaining my form and the club maintaining its form.

‘I always set my targets as high as possible while trying to stay realistic. But my ambition has to be to break into that England squad. I would love to be capped in the World Cup. First and foremost, I’d love to be part of the World Cup squad in the summer. That would give me a shot and then it would be down to me to take my opportunity.’

Following the personal tragedy of last season, few would begrudge Simpson a break.
