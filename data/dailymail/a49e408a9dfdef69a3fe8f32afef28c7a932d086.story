People who were injured in the nerve gas attack that killed 1,429 people in Syria have been flown to the UK for secret treatment and tests, according to a rebel leader.

Ahmad Asi al-Jarba, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said a 'small number' of victims were in the UK and the deadly gas Sarin was found in their bodies.

'The president was told (on Thursday) during a meeting that the results from the examinations confirmed sarin gas on these individuals,' said Hadi Albahra, the secretary of the political committee within the coalition.

The two or three victims are from the Ghouta area and would remain in Britain until they have recovered, reports The Sunday Times.

He added: 'They are in a stable condition but they found traces of sarin gas inside their systems.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not confirm the Syrian statement.

The news comes as a survey revealed that British voters oppose military action over Syria - even if it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people.

Syria claims rebels carried out the August 21 attack.

The Sunday Telegraph poll shows a large proportion of voters do not want a second Commons vote on military intervention, even if the UN confirms the attacks.

A total of 46 per cent say MPs should not vote again if proof is found, while 36 per cent say they should. Meanwhile 47 per cent says Britain should take no military action, but continue to provide aid.

Nearly 20 per cent say Britian should take military action along with the U.S.

The White House is making a big push to rally members of Congress and the American public behind President Barack Obama's plan for a U.S. military strike against Syria.

Recent opinion surveys show intense American skepticism about military intervention in Syria, even among those who believe Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people.

At least 150 people picketed outside the White House on Saturday to oppose any military action against Syria. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan.

Syria's use of chemical weapons is 'an evil we must stand up to one way or another', William Hague said today, but insisted the Government was not 'gung-ho' about military action.

The Foreign Secretary will hold talks in London tomorrow with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as Washington seeks to bolster international support for an armed response.

He insisted the US remained 'very committed' to the so-called special relationship despite MPs defeating David Cameron to vote against a strike against Bashar Assad's regime.

U.S. lawmakers are now deciding whether a military response is warranted. President Obama has assured Americans action in Syria will not lead to a full invasion like in Iraq and Afghanistan

Mr Hague said he was determined to ensure Britain does not 'matter less' in the world in future.

Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said he recognised there was 'a lot of public unease about intervention overseas'.

'Be reassured that we have learned lessons of Iraq. We are not seeking to be drawn into wars in the Middle East. We now make decisions in a completely different way,' he said.

'We are not a Government that is gung-ho about military action.'

But he said Britain must also not 'turn in on ourselves'.

Mr Hague added: 'Britain has great and positive influence in the world, and we must make sure that we retain that. I am very determined, as the Prime Minister is, that we will not matter less.'

The Government was 'not planning to go back again' to the Commons for another vote, he said.

'If circumstances change dramatically, then of course everybody would be looking at things in a different light,' he accepted.

But he said there was 'no guarantee' that Labour would not repeat its 'rather opportunistic and partisan' decision to oppose the Government motion.

'On major issues of international peace and security, oppositions should be able to rise above that. So there would be no guarantee on a future occasion that they would not behave in that way again.'

Mr Hague said it was right for the UK to supply the Syrian National Coalition with non-lethal equipment.

'Terrible things do happen on both sides but that does not mean that everyone in Syria is evil. As in any country, there are millions of people who just want peace and democracy and freedom.'
