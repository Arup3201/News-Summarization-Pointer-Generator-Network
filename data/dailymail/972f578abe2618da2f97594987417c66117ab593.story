He was asked  to list his occupation on an arrest report.

So, suspect Robert Phillips, who is facing multiple drugs charges, wrote 'drug dealer'.

The 25-year-old, whose answer left police bemused, was arrested after he allegedly cut in front of an unmarked sheriff's car and nearly caused a crash in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday.

Following the incident, the detective who was driving the car performed a records check on Phillips's Hyundai and realized it was stolen. He then tracked the suspect to Tenth Avenue North.

After pulling up in the 2000 block of the street, the detective watched as Phillips engaged in a 'hand-to-hand drugs transaction involving heroin'. He then alerted his colleagues, who arrived in marked cars.

Phillips, who realized he had been caught out, fled the scene 'at high speed', before pulling into a parking lot and running into an arts store in nearby Okeechobee Boulevard, police said. 

Once inside the store, he reportedly crashed into a female customer, knocking her to the ground. At the same time, the suspect dropped a loaded handgun, his arrest report said. 

Phillips then ran out the back of the store, where deputies were poised to arrest him. After detaining him, they carried out a search and found he was carrying 22g of heroin and $2,316 in cash, it is said. 

A later search of the stolen Hyundai that Phillips had been driving reportedly produced 5.3g of crack cocaine, as well as a drug scale and hypodermic needles, according to the Palm Beach Post.

Now, Phillips is facing a number of charges, including three counts of resisting arrest with violence, two counts of possession of drug equipment and one count of heroin trafficking.

He is also charged with possession of a weapon or ammunition by a career criminal, possession of cocaine with intent to sell, committing a first-degree felony with a weapon, fleeing and eluding law enforcement at high speed, striking a police animal, battery and driving with a suspended license.

According to his arrest report, Phillips has been arrested more than a dozen times in Palm Beach County - seven times on felony counts. He served nearly nine months in prison in 2011 and 2012.

The suspect remains in jail on a $242,000 bond.
