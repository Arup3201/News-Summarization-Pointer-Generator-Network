The widow of an Indian soldier decapitated by Pakistani forces during the recent border clashes in Kashmir is demanding the immediate return of her husband's head.

Grieving Dharamvati Singh along 
with several members of her family today agreed to call off a hunger strike that
had lasted for six-days following a visit by Uttar Pradesh chief minister 
Akhilesh Yada.

They are demanding the Indian government puts maximum pressure on Islamabad to return the head of Corporal Lans Naik Hemraj Singh whose brutal killing last week prompted a national outcry.

India and Pakistan have both lost two soldiers after fighting along parts of the 460-mile ceasefire line high in the Himalayan mountains broke out earlier this month.

Last week's violence was the worst outbreak in the region which both nations claim as sovereign territory since the two sides agreed a ceasefire nine years ago

The beheading of Corporal Lans Naik Hemraj Singh prompted a national outcry in India

Speaking from their village in northern India, the slain sodier's sister Jai Singh said: 'Our demand is not something big.

'My brother's head should be brought back and the Pakistanis should be taught a lesson.'

Indian Army chief General Bikram Singh described the beheading as a 'gruesome act' and against the ethics of soldiering.

He said a strong protest had been lodged with Pakistani authorities through diplomatic channels.

General Singh went on to accuse Pakistan of planningÂ  week's attack and said India reserved the right to retaliate.

His comments appear certain to further inflame tensions between the nuclear-armed enemies.

Speaking just hours before local commanders were to meet at 
the border to identify ways of reducing tensions and avoiding further 
clashes he said: 'The 
attack on January 8 was premeditated, a pre-planned activity.

'Such an 
operation requires planning, detailed reconnaissance.'

Body: Indian army personnel carry the coffin of Lans Naik Hemraj. He was one of
four soldiers from both sides to be killed in the recent clashes

Condemnation: Indian Army chief General Bikram Singh described the beheading as a 'gruesome act' and against the ethics of soldiering

General Singh said India reserved the right to retaliate against provocative acts on the border at a time and place of its choosing.

'I expect all my commanders at the Line of Control to be both aggressive and offensive in the face of provocation and fire,' he said.

Pakistan has termed the Indian allegations as propaganda and blamed it for violations on the ceasefire line.

Indian and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.

Islamabad accused Indian soldiers of entering its territory and killing a soldier on Jan 6.

Patrol: Indian army soldiers near India-Pakistan Line of control (LOC), in Rajouri about 155 km from the northern Indian city of Jammu in the disputed region of Kashmir

Ceasefire line: Last week's violence was the worst outbreak in the region which both nations claim as sovereign territory in nine yeas

India said Pakistani soldiers intruded about 600 metres (yards) into its territory two days later and killed two Indian soldiers on patrol, the attack Singh was referring to.

Pakistan said one of its soldiers was killed in further fighting on Thursday.

Both India and Pakistan claim the 
largely Muslim territory of Kashmir but it remains divided between them 
along a Line of Control (LoC).

The countries, both nuclear powers, have 
fought two wars over the Himalayan area but a cease-fire has largely held 
for a decade.

Firing and small skirmishes are 
common along the 460-mile LoC despite the ceasefire and improving relations. The Indian army says eight of its soldiers 
were killed in 2012, in 75 incidents.

Away from the border, however, ties have 
appeared to be improving. Pakistan's cricket team completed a two-week 
tour of India on Sunday, the first time it has visited in five years.
