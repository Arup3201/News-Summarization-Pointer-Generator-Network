Nottingham Forest striker Britt Assombalonga has been ruled out for 12 months following knee surgery.

Assombalonga was carried from the pitch on a stretcher during the midweek win over Wigan and is the club's top scorer this season.

Chairman and Nottingham Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi insists the club will do everything they can to help his recovery.

The 22-year-old required surgery to after suffering a ruptured patellar tendon.

Assombalonga scored his 15th Championship goal of the season in the 3-0 win over Wigan but was stretchered off the pitch in agony and requiring oxygen in the 67th minute after falling awkwardly. 

Dougie Freedman confirmed the loss of the club's £5.5m record signing is devastating news.

'Losing Britt is a blow but we have players who are more than capable of stepping in,' said Freedman.

'Matty Fryatt came on [on Wednesday against Wigan] and did well, and Dexter Blackstock has been around the block and knows what's required.

'In the meantime, I've been working with the players preparing for Saturday.

'I feel Nottingham Forest fans deserve a team to proud of - and that's what we're working towards. I want to try to show Nottingham Forest fans what they want. I think they want a team that is committed and that is attacking.
