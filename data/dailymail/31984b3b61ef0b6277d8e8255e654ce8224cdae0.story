Time Magazine revealed on Monday the finalists to become the publication's coveted Person of the Year, and the list ranges from the woman who made 'twerking' famous - or infamous, depending on who you ask - to the pope.

Pop star Miley Cyrus and Pope Francis are just two of the 10 finalists on Time's list for this year's Person of the Year, an annual honor bestowed by the magazine upon the year's top news maker.

Editors at Time will now decide who - for better or worse - most influenced the world over the past year.

Twerk it: Love her or hate her, Miley Cyrus - and her tongue - made a lot of headlines in 2013

Pope of the year: Pope Francis has been in the news daily since his ascension to pope in March

Leaker: Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden is now living in asylum in Russia

Repeat: President Barack Obama was named Time's Person of the year in 2012 and is on the short-list for 2013

'Power is not just political. It can be cultural, it can be spiritual,' Nancy Gibbs, Time’s managing editor, said on the Today Show on Monday, adding that Cyrus 'came in like a wrecking ball, literally,' referring to Cyrus' hit song and the 'risqué video that continued to keep her in the public spotlight.'

'At a time when you’re living with an explosion of exhibitionism since we all now carry cameras with us at all times she is a symbol of the way we live,' Gibbs said.

Amazon: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post this year

Obamacare: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has taken heat over the failures of Obamacare

Infamous: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is believed to have used chemical weapons against his own people

Should Miley Cyrus be Time Magazine's Person Of The Year?

Also on the list is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who the United States declared was behind a chemical attack on his own people during a bloody civil war with no end in sight; former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified information about government surveillance programs; and Edie Windsor, whose lawsuit struck down the Defense of Marriage Act.

Texas senator and Tea Party darling Ted Cruz also is on the list, as is Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

President Barack Obama, who was named 2012's Person of the Year, also is on this year's list of candidates.

An online poll on the Today website 
shows that Pope Francis is the fan-favorite, raking in 62-percent of the
vote. Snowden takes the number two spot with 14-percent. Cyrus is the 
third-most-popular with 8-percent of the vote.

Past winners include John F. Kennedy, Mohandas Gandhi, Nelson Mandella and Ronald Reagan.

Other less-reputable recipients of Time's recognition include Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Ayatullah Khomeini.

Time will announce the 2013 Person of the Year on the Today Show on Wednesday.
