A toddler bled to death on a hospital's high dependency unit because of a delay in life-saving surgery and a 'complete failure' of communication between doctors, an inquest has heard.

Tharun Umashankar, aged two, died from bleeding of the stomach lining which was probably caused by his intolerance to milk.

He was rushed to Sheffield Children's Hospital, where he had been been receiving treatment for the previous two weeks after vomiting blood.

Despite having suffered a previous large internal bleed he was not slated for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the following day - a delay that proved fatal.

Independent expert Dr David Crabbe, a paediatric surgeon said the procedure would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had a life-saving operation to remove part of his stomach.

He told the Sheffield inquest: 'What was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastro-enterologists. Closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome.'

Tharun's distraught mother Sentamil, 38, broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing: 'I believed they would cure him and make him well.'

The young boy had had three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain but was thought well enough to be discharged on Friday, July 9, 2010.

Consultant paediatric gastro-enterologist Dr David Campbell, who was in overall charge of Tharun although off duty that weekend, said he left instructions to be called if the boy had a serious bleed again.

Mrs Umashankar, who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven, left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again.

'He cried and I felt he was in pain,' she said. 'His body was cool and exhausted.'

Tharun was rushed by ambulance to 
Barnsley District Hospital and several hours later was transferred to 
the Children's Hospital unit on the afternoon of Saturday, July 10.

Mrs Umashankar said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was 'full of blood' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses.

'A nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth,' she said.

Tharun should have had an endocopy as soon as he was readmitted to hospital on the Saturday afternoon. Instead he was monitored as his condition worsened, an inquest heard. He died the next day

Mrs Umashankar was then told by staff that Dr Campbell would perform another endoscopy on Tharun at 8am on the Sunday morning.

But in the middle of the night she noticed his stomach was distended and 'swollen like a bubble.' A doctor thought it might simply be a build-up of gas but at 4am Tharun vomited blood again.

The mother said 'all the doctors were in panic and confused' by 6.30am at which time Dr Campbell arrived.

'I was really pleased, I believed he was going to save my son,' Mrs Umashankar said.

But despite a blood transfusion, Tharun failed to respond and he died at 9am on the Sunday.

Paediatric registrar Dr Tafadzwa 
Makaya, whose job was to stabilise the boy, told the Sheffield inquest 
she had not been informed of any "red button plan" to alert Dr Campbell 
and a surgical team if there was a further bleed.

When
she first saw Tharun he was sat up in bed watching CBeebies on a 
monitor with his mother and appeared stable. She was only called by a 
nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again.

She
instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a 
raised pulse, called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of 
blood which should have been ready but were not so fresh ones had to be 
made up.

Dr Makaya said she alerted both the 
surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told Dr 
Campbell would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am.

When
coroner Chris Dorries pointed out that Dr Campbell had asked to be made
aware if there was any further bleeding she replied: 'There was no red 
button plan delivered to me.'

Dr
Michael Powers QC, for the family, put it to Dr Makaya: 'Knowing that 
this is a significant bleed, you didn't make any contact with anyone 
anywhere until 6.15am.'

She replied: 'I assessed and I managed and then I contacted my superiors.'

Tharun died at Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured). A lack of teamwork between surgeons and gastro-enterologists was partly to blame, an inquest heard

Specialist paediatric registrar Dr James Pauling said he arranged for Dr Campbell to do the endoscopy on Sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place.

He said: 'I don't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding.'

He himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a 'serious finding.'

Mrs Umashankar and her petrol station cashier husband Sivananthan, 42, ran a grocery store in Barnsley at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in Tooting, London. They came to the UK 12 years ago and are British nationals.

Dr Crabbe who reviewed the case said Tharun had a 'mighty strange illness' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastro-intestinal bleeding in a child before.

He said the Children's Hospital was unique in that Tharun was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons. The boy should have had an endoscopy on the Saturday which was an "error of judgment" by the doctors caring for him.

'The benefits of identifying the cause of the bleeding far outweigh the potential risks,' he said.

'I would say Dr Campbell was taking a risk.'

The inquest was adjourned.
