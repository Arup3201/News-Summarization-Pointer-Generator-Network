Accused: Ted Terry, the father of Chelsea captain John, has been charged with carrying out a racist attack in central London

The father of Chelsea footballer John Terry has been charged today with carrying out a racist attack on a man after a scuffle in the City of London.

Ted Terry, 59, was arrested earlier this year following the incident on Fenchurch Street in capital's Square Mile.

This afternoon he was charged with two racially motivated offences when he answered bail at Bishopsgate Police Station.

He is accused of committing a racially aggravated common assault and a public order offence.

Two other men, Tudor Musteata, 47, and Stephen Niland, 36, were also charged following the fracas at 8pm on March 22.

They both face a single allegation that they caused a ‘fear of violence’ that was racially aggravated.

City of London Police, which is responsible for the inquiry, declined to elaborate on exactly what is alleged to have taken place.

A spokesman said: 'As charges have now been brought we are unable to comment further on the nature of the incident.'

It is not the first time that the Terry family has had a run in with the law.

Last year, John Terry, for the former England captain, was cleared of racially abusing fellow footballer Anton Ferdinand.

The defender denied making the comments to the Queens Park Rangers player during a match at Loftus Road the previous year.

The verdict brought to an end a long saga which saw Terry stripped of the national captaincy and England manager Fabio Capello resign in protest.

It was the latest controversy in a chequered career for John Terry, which included his arrest following a fight at a nightclub in 2002.

He was later cleared of four charges, including affray and wounding with intent.

In November 2010, Ted Terry suffered a serious head injury when he was attacked by fans from rival Tottenham Hotspur.

He was rushed to hospital for stitches after the late evening attack at Upminster Station in East London.

Terry’s mother Sue, 55, and mother-in-law Sue Poole, 59, were cautioned for shoplifting from Tesco and Marks & Spencer in 2009.

Terry, of Grays, Essex, Musteata, of Greenwich, South East London, and Niland, of Romford, Essex, were released on bail.

All three men were ordered to appear before City of London Magistrates’ Court on July 23.
