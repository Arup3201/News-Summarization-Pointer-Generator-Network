Angel Di Maria has wasted no time in getting to know his new surroundings after signing for Manchester United.

The £60m winger, who completed his move from Real Madrid on Tuesday evening, dined at the popular San Carlo Italian restaurant before taking a stroll back to the nearby Lowry Hotel, where he is staying.

United fans will be pleased to hear that Di Maria is due to be officially unveiled at 3pm on Thursday afternoon.

Wearing a grey Dolce & Gabbana hoodie bearing a picture of American actor and Rebel Without a Cause star James Dean, the Argentine smiled for the cameras as he walked along.

He even took time to pose for photographs with staff at the restaurant, which is a favourite haunt of Manchester's footballers.

After signing a five-year contract at Old Trafford that will earn him £6.5m-a-year net, the 26-year-old declared he would not have left Real for any other club.

Di Maria said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining Manchester United.'I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Spain and there were a lot of clubs interested in me, but United is the only club that I would have left Real Madrid for.

'Louis van Gaal is a fantastic coach with a proven track record of success and I am impressed by the vision and determination everyone has to get this club back to the top – where it belongs. I now just cannot wait to get started.'

United slumped to a fresh low on Tuesday night when they were thrashed 4-0 by third-tier MK Dons in the second round of the Capital One Cup.

Di Maria was not registered in time to play a part in that fixture but he is expected to make his debut in the Barclays Premier League at Burnley on Saturday.

United lost to Swansea in their opening league match of the season and then drew at Sunderland.

They have now spent £132m this summer on Di Maria, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo as Van Gaal tries to turn an under-performing squad into title challengers.

More players could come in before the close of the transfer window on Monday, with United in talks with Juventus for Arturo Vidal and keen on Ajax defender Daley Blind.
