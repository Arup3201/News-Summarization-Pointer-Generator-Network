A father has attacked a court's decision to fine him more than £400 for taking his daughter out of school to go to her grandmother's funeral - despite the fact she missed 40 days of term-time.

Ikram Hussain, 51, took his daughter Imaan out of Paddock Junior Infant and Nursery School in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to attend his 86-year-old mother Gulab Bi's funeral in Pakistan.

However, he was hauled before magistrates after his daughter, who was aged five at the time, failed to return to classes for more than a month.

Mr Hussain's mother died on March 3 and he said he joined his wife Humaira, 31, the following day in attending the school to inform them of their plans to attend the funeral abroad.

However, the taxi driver said the couple were told they would be fined if they proceeded as intended because they wanted their daughter, who is now six, to have a lengthy period off school because the funeral service included 40 days of prayer.

The father of four said it is part of Muslim tradition to take 40 days of mourning following a relatives death. 

He said he travelled to the country, with his wife and daughter, to bury his mother's body immediately after her death and stayed for a further 40 days while the community helped the family mourn. 

He said that, as part of the tradition, friends and family members would visit the family during the 40-day period before they all attended a service on the last day to say the final prayers to the deceased.

He is now angry at a court's decision to fine him after he took his daughter out of school on March 4 and didn't send her back to classes until April 9.

Last week, Mr Hussain appeared alongside his wife at Kirklees Magistrates' Court and pleaded guilty to the offence.

The couple were fined £416 including court costs after an original fine for keeping their daughter out of school was increased due to non-payment.

Under new measures brought in last year, parents can now be fined for taking their children out of school during term-time. 

Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year.

However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, can face a fine of up to £60 for every child.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail.

Mr Hussain, of Paddock, Huddersfield, disputes the court's decision and said he wanted the court case to go to trial because he wanted a jury to 'hear what he had to say'.

He said: 'At the time I was not really bothered but I am annoyed about it now. It's not as if it was a pleasant trip for us to make.

'I had no other choice but to take my daughter with me to do the burial.  It’s something we had to do.

'The magistrates were not interested in what I had to say. I wanted a jury to hear what I had to say but it seems that's not possible.'

Gill Ellis, assistant director for learning and skills at the school, said: 'The law makes it clear that head teachers can only grant leave of absence during term time for exceptional reasons.

'It is at the discretion of the head teacher to decide what is exceptional and how many days a child can be away from school if leave is granted.

'If a parent decides to take the child out of school without the head teacher's permission then they will have 21 days from the day the fine is issued before it doubles.

'If after 28 days the fine remains unpaid then the council will normally proceed with prosecution.

'The court then determines whether the parents are guilty of an offence. Parents are advised of the process when they make the initial leave request.

'We are committed to providing the best start in life for our young people, in schools.

'Therefore, every lesson of every day is important and absence from school can be very damaging to a child's education.

'We have an excellent record in Kirklees of reducing absence from school and overwhelmingly it is the case that parents are very supportive of the measures taken locally to promote attendance at school.' 

The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer faced a fine and potential prison sentence in August after allowing her daughter to skip seven days of school.

Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned.

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. 

Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups and between January and March this year Miss Capper kept her at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

However, the mother was summoned to appear before magistrates for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’. 

Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates last month for failing to pay the £60 penalty fine, which was later increased to £120.

Birmingham Council said no reason was given for the time off and that Ms Capper had failed to attend meetings arranged by the school to discuss the situation.

However, the unemployed mother was cleared by the bench who said that while magistrates felt Ms Capper was in breach of the school's truancy policy processes she was 'not necessarily in breach of the law'.

Earlier this year, parents Andrew and Danielle Overend-Hogg were sent a threatening letter warning them about their three children missing class after they took them off school for a week for their grandfather's funeral.

The children, Teagan, nine, Isla, five and Elsie-Mae, three, travelled with their parents and eight-month-old brother Noah from their home in Sheffield to Cumbria for the funeral service.

The Catholic funeral service stretched over two days, meaning the three youngsters missed a week of school.

Mr and Mrs Overend-Hogg said they were 'disgusted' by the letter that awaited their return.

Officials in Ballifield Primary School in Sheffield said the absence was 'unsanctioned' and as a result could  jeopardise the children's place in the school.

And in May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of school for her grandfather’s funeral. 

Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.
