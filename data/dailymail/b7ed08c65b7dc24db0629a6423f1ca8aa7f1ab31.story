Hundreds of Britain’s brightest A-level pupils are leaving the country as part of a brain drain to study at foreign universities.

Around 600 students who scored three A or A* grades in their A-levels last summer did not take places at UK universities in the autumn.

Some are believed to be reapplying this year, but others have taken places at European universities and Ivy League US colleges after being put off by the introduction of £9,000 fees in the UK.

The traditional choice: Oxford and Cambridge are the only British institutions still in the top 10 globally but they could miss out to other world-ranking universities

Independent school heads have reported an increased interest in applying abroad by pupils who believe that foreign universities can offer better value for money.

Sixth formers are also attracted by incentives such as top class sporting facilities or better opportunities for working overseas after graduation.

One in four pupils at the sixth form at Sevenoaks School in Kent have applied to American universities this year.

Two students from the school last year rejected offers from Cambridge for Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.

Another turned down an offer to study English at Oxford to go to Yale.

Headmistress Katy Ricks told the Sunday Times: ‘The interest in American universities has grown strongly here.

‘The top end of our range are looking globally.

‘There are a small group of brilliant students who are choosing between Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge and Oxford, and it is no longer a given that they will choose the British option.’

More pupils are also applying to European universities, where tuition frees are often less than a third of those in the UK.

Maastricht University in the Netherlands, which offers degrees taught in English and charges £1,600 in annual fees, said it had seen an 80 per cent rise in the number of UK students in the past year.

New international rankings released last week show that UK universities have lost ground on those in the United States and emerging Asian economies.

Oxford and Cambridge were the only 
British institutions still in the top 10, according to the table 
complied by the Times Higher Education supplement based on the academic 
reputation of universities across the world.

However five other 
elite British universities, including Edinburgh and Imperial College 
London, are in the top 50.

The Universities and Colleges 
Admissions Service does not have figures for how many British A level 
students went abroad to study last year.

But research carried out from its end 
of year report in 2012 found that for the first time in a decade the 
proportion of students with A grades starting university in Britain fell
below the figure for freshers with slightly lower grades.

Professor Sir Steve Smith, chairman of
Ucas, told the Sunday Times: ‘It would be genuinely worrying if there 
were a trend developing that large numbers of students with top grades 
were deciding to go to universities other than British ones.

‘That would be of great concern.’
