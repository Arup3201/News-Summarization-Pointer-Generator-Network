South African-born golfer Gary Player is one of the 21 athletes who will strip down for ESPN Magazine's 2013 Body Issue.

Not only is the 77-year-old the oldest one in this year's bunch - which includes 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, tennis star John Isner and Wizards point guard John Wall - but he is also officially the oldest athlete ever to to pose nude for the special edition.

The nine-time grand slam champion's appearance in the magazine serves to remind readers that physical fitness is not reserved exclusively for the young.

Gary bares all: South African golf pro Gary Player, 77, will be the oldest of 21 athletes to pose nude for ESPN Magazine's 2013 Body Issue

The golfer, who earned the nickname Mr Fitness in the Fifties, took to Twitter to share his excitement about the upcoming magazine.

'I was at first hesitant,' he wrote. 'But @ESPNmag's Body Issue celebrates the human body. No matter what your age, we should all look after ourselves!'

Mr Player, who has six children and 21 grandchildren with his wife of 56 years, VIvienne Verwey, began playing golf professionally in 1953.

Famous for his intense workout regime, which includes 1,000 sit-ups a day, the golfer has been training particularly hard for the upcoming shoot, according to Golf Digest.

Mr Player is often credited for making intense physical fitness an integral part of golfing.

'When other players first saw my weight-training program back in the 1950s, they thought I was crazy,' he told the magazine in 2011.

Olden days: Mr Player (pictured in the 1970s) has always been known for his intense physical workout - which apparently includes 1,000 sit-ups a day

Family man: Mr Player has been married to his wife Vivienne (pictured in April 1961) for 56 years. The couple have six children and 21 grandchildren together

'In fact, lifting weights has made me a better golfer.'

Mr Player explained in the same interview that his older brother Ian, now a notable environmental educator, first instigated his passion for exercise when he was eight years old.

'Today I'm about as fit as a 75-year-old man can be,' he said. 'The secret is commitment. It cannot be a fad. Even if your exercise program is small, you must make it a part of your life.'

Another important part of Mr Player's life is his family; in the early days of his career the golfer was known to bring his wife, six children, nanny and a tutor along with him to each tournament.

Winning days: The golfer (pictured in 1959, after winning the British Open at Muirfield in Scotland) was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974

Staying strong: 'The secret is commitment,' the father-of-six (in Augusta, Georgia, circa 1960s) has said about fitness. 'It cannot be a fad. Even if your exercise program is small, you must make it a part of your life'

Along with Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, Mr Player is known as one of the 'Big Three' golfers, who competed against each other in every major tournament in the Sixties and were considered the best three golfers in the world at that time.

Mr Player, who no longer plays competitively, was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974.

ESPN Magazine's Body Issue - which shows nude athletes, but strategically maintains their dignity - will hit shelves on July 12.
