Three hospitals in western Virginia say they had room for the mentally disturbed son of Virginia state Senator Creigh Deeds the day before he lashed out and brutally stabbed his father and killed himself.

The reports from the hospitals, all within two hours driving distance from the Deeds family home, contradict earlier claims that Austin 'Gus' Deeds was examined by psychiatrists and then released back to his family Monday when no open beds in psychiatric wards could be found.

Creigh Deeds, who was stabbed repeatedly in the head and torso, improved to good condition today at University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville. He was initially flown to the hospital Tuesday morning in critical condition suffering from massive blood loss, but his prognosis has steadily improved.

Police say Gus Deeds stabbed his father Tuesday morning and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head at the family farm in rural Bath County in western Virginia.

On Monday, Gus was evaluated by 
psychiatrists at the Rockbridge Community Services Board in Lexington after an emergency commitment order was 
filed against him, a source told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

The
source said he was only released because there was no room for him at 
any psychiatric wards across a 'wide swath' of western Virginia.

However, the Washington Post found three hospitals within driving distance of the Deeds family home in Bath County that said they had a room for Gus Monday.

Administrators
at Western State Hospital in Staunton, Rockingham Memorial Hospital in 
Harrisonburg and the University of Virginia Medical Center in 
Charlottesville all told the newspaper that they had open psychiatric 
beds.Â 

Spokesmen for Western
State Hospital and Rockingham Memorial Hospital said the doctors on 
call Monday night were never contacted by the Rockbridge Community 
Services Board.

Warm embrace: Deeds hugs his son Gus after losing his bid to become governor of Virginia. Deeds suffered political humiliation after the 18-point landslide loss

Virginia State police surround the home of Senator Creigh Deeds in Millboro today to investigate the fatal incident

Staunton is about 39 miles from the Deeds family home near Millboro. Harrisonburg is 60 miles away.

It is unknown why Gus wasn't taken to any of those three hospitals.

The Highland County Recorder reports that Austin 'Gus' Deeds attacked his father before shooting himself in the head at the politician's home in Millboro Springs.

Police have not commented on a motive.

Gus had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, which he attended off-and-on since 2007. He took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father with his losing campaign for governor.

He was enrolled this year, but withdrew from the university last month. Administrators said he was a music theory major with a 'strong academic record.'

Classmates said he was a talented, hard-working musician and a warm friend.

On his Facebook page, Gus listed his political views as: 'Too busy with love to care.' He was one of four children of 55-year-old Deeds.

Gus was arrested for alcohol possession in May 2009 when hew was 20 after police caught him at a house party near his home.

Deeds is being treated at the University of Virginia Medical Center and is listed in critical condition.

State
police were called to Deeds' house about 7.30am Tuesday after a cousin 
who happened to be driving down the county road near Deeds' house found 
the state senator stumbling down the road and away from his home.

He was flown 
to the hospital. Gus Deeds was found alive in the house, but he died 
before he could be stabilized and put on a helicopter.

'Virginia
State Police are on the scene of an assault of a state legislator that 
took place Tuesday morning,' authorities said in a news release.

'Senator
Creigh Deeds has been transported to U.Va. Hospital in Charlottesville 
for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the assault at his 
residence.'

Despite his extensive wounds, Deeds has been able to speak with investigators and give them information about the attack.

Deeds rose to national fame during the 
2009 Virginia governor's race in which he lost by a landslide of nearly 
18 percentage points to Bob McDonnell.

He and his wife of two decades, Pam, 
divorced in February 2010 after the embarrassing loss turned him into a 
punchline in some political circles.

Deeds said his marriage to Pam, right, fell apart because of the rigors of his political career. The two divorced in February 2010

In 2010 he told the Washington Post that the divorce was 'a casualty of a nearly 20-year pursuit of a lifelong ambition that kept him away from home.'

He married Siobhan Lomax in a quiet ceremony in June 2012.

Lomax,
44, owns a boutique near the campus of Washington and Lee University in
Lexington, Virginia, where Deeds has been a visiting law professor 
since 2010.

Condolences immediately began to pour for Deeds and his family.

Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz tweeted: 'Thinking and praying for Creigh Deeds and his entire family. He's a great man and public servant.'

Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican who beat Deeds in the governor's race in 2009 and for attorney general in 2005, also offered his condolences.

'In this tough and sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family. The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,' McDonnell said in a statement.

'Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service.'
