Shocking: Robb Montejano was struck by lightning while trying to film a storm

A man in Seattle ended up filming his own brush with death while trying to capture cellphone video in a lightning storm on Saturday.

'The electricity flowing through my body. I can't describe it. It was amazing,' Robb Montejano told KOMO News.

Montejano was walking through an open field when he saw lightning rolling across the sky, so he pulled out his cell phone and paused to get a video of the storm.

'Just on the off chance that I can catch the lightning on film,' he can be heard saying in the recording.

That's when he was struck with a jolt of electricity.

Montejano can be heard in the recording crying out in shock and falling to the ground as a loud crash is audible in the background.

'I just felt this surge of electricity go 'boom' through my body,' he said after the incident.

Emergency responders quickly arrived on the scene but shockingly Montejano had not sustained any serious injuries.

Though the odds of being hit are slim, lightning strikes in the US claim about 10% of their victims, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

One person was killed and nine others hospitalized after a bolt of lightning struck the water last month in Venice Beach.

Two hikers were also killed in back-to-back lightning strikes at the Rocky Mountain National Park.

Montejano posted the video to YouTube shortly after with the title: 'I was struck by lightning! What have you done today?'
