He already has a Vatican passport which grants him the same privileges as heads of state.

But that hasn't stopped Pope Francis from renewing his Argentine passport and national identity card.

The pope has chosen to sign up for the documents  - enabling him to travel around the world as a regular Argentine citizen.

Patriotic: The official documents will enable the pontiiff to travel around the world as a regular Argentine citizen

However, he will now have to wait days to receive them as his request is processed through Argentina's administrative channels.

During the renewal process, the head of the Roman Catholic Church had his photo taken by the country's Vatican envoy at his hotel in Italy.

He also scanned his fingerprints and recorded his signature using a notebook computer.

But he opted out of receiving any privileges - and even insisted on paying for the passport and identity card himself, ambassador Juan Pablo Cafiero told the Associated Press.

Renewing Argentine passports and identity cards usually cost about $55 (£33) at the official exchange rate.

'He wanted it for when he travels. The Argentine passport is valuable for that,' said Mr Cafiero.

Argentina’s government, which often draws attention to the new pope’s roots, released pictures of 
the 76-year-old pontiff's new identification card yesterday.

white papal outfit in classic Argentine style - with a serious expression on his face.

Since 
popes automatically adopt Vatican citizenship, interior minister 
Florencio Randazzo said the passport renewal 'fills us with pride'.

He added: 'Francis specifically asked not to enjoy any privileges so his new identification card and passport have been processed through the usual administrative channels.

'In coming days, he will receive his passport in the Casa Santa Marta in the Vatican, where he has stated he is a resident.'

The pope has opted to live in the smaller Vatican guest house instead of the official papal apartments - part of the humble lifestyle he has embraced since assuming the papacy last year.
