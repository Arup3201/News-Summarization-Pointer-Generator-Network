A father whose daughter was taken off life support following complications in child birth has said goodbye to her just days after his apartment was destroyed by a fire.

Wilbur Crockett's 23-year-old daughter, Destiny Crockett, was put on life support after the delivery of her second child, a girl, at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston on April 20, the Portland Press Herald reported.

'I
 said my final goodbyes today before they took her off life support,' he told the newspaper, adding that her organs had been given to donors.

'I feel something good should come out of this even though it is a terrible loss for our family,' he said.

Crockett's loss came after his third floor apartment in Biddeford was ravaged by fire that appeared to have started on the floor below on Saturday afternoon, WGME reported. The cause of the fire is not yet known and no one was hurt, although cats were killed.

Mystery still surrounds exactly what went wrong in Destiny's delivery and officials at Central Maine Medical Center would not provide details, citing confidentiality.

'We have expressed our condolences [to 
the family] and are doing everything possible to support them through 
this tragic situation,' hospital spokesman Chuck Gill said.

'Central Maine Medical Center takes 
patient safety very seriously. An extensive internal review of all 
aspects of this patient's care is being conducted to identify the root 
causes of this event.'

Family members said as Destiny gave birth - joined by the baby's father, Dwain Coughlin - she was given an epidural anesthetic to manage her pain, which is routine.

Dr
 Daniel Campos, an attending anesthesiologist at Maine Medical Center, said 
life-threatening complications from an epidural are 'extremely
 rare', the Press Herald reported.

'It's
 a very safe practice,' Campos said. 'When we quote risk factors, we say
 those types of serious complications are to the magnitude of one out of
 hundreds of thousands of cases.'

The young mother, who leaves behind an eight-year-old daughter, had a healthy pregnancy, family members said. Her newborn daughter is doing well.

Destiny's Facebook page lists that she studied business at Kaplan University before staying at home to bring up her daughter.

Her family said they are now struggling to come to terms with her death, but know she would have wanted her organs to help other people.

'She was very loving and would do anything for anyone,' her sister Teasha said.
