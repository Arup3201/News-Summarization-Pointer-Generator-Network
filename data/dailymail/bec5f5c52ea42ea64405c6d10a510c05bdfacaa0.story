The number of white children being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent, showing the capital is going through a baby boom.

New figures released by the US Census Bureau suggested the number of infants and toddlers under the age of five has grown in the district by five per cent up to 39,000.

The statistics also highlighted the number of children aged between five and 13 had risen by seven per cent, but teenagers older than 14 were declining.

Baby boom: The number of white infants and toddlers being born in Washington D.C. has risen by 34 per cent

The rise among white infants and toddlers is being attributed to new parents in their 30s and early 40s.

Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution told the Washington Post a similar phenomenon is occurring in urban centres such as Manhattan, where young white professionals have settled and established lives before marriage and children.

He said: 'They came for the bright lights of the city, and started dating and mating.'

The drop in teenagers was blamed on families leaving the city before their sons or daughters started high school.

The District’s baby boom is spiking not only in neighborhoods that have long attracted families, such as the suburban-like Upper Northwest or family-friendly Capitol Hill.

Babies and toddlers are often seen on city streets near downtown neighborhoods such as Logan and Dupont circles.

Places like Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights are predominantly filled with young, single adults and have been responsible for most of the capital's growth over the past decade.
