Audio recordings obtained by police allegedly reveal Ms Wright was fearing for her life moments before plunging to her death from Tostee's 14 floor balcony

The 26-year-old Kiwi tourist's final words were allegedly: 'NO, no, no ... I just want to go home,'

Police will rely on High Court findings in other cases where victims have attempted to flee in fear before dying in order for the the murder charge to remain.

They will allege Ms Wright and Tostee met in Cavill Mall about 9pm on August 7 after connecting on Tinder before going back to his apartment.

Witnesses told police they heard a man and woman arguing and the woman screaming 'No, no, no' several times and 'I just want to go home'

Police will allege she was attempting to climb down to the balcony below to escape Tostee when she fell to her death.

CCTV footage obtained by police allegedly shows Tostee in the building foyer after the incident.

It will be alleged Tostee hid behind a pillar as police surrounded Ms Wright’s body where he can be seen pacing backwards and forwards before taking the lift to the basement and exiting the building.

The cameras allegedly capture him carrying what appeared to be a phone and police later allege they found three mobile phones in a car in the bulding's basement.

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, says Tostee maintains he is not guilty of the murder and will be applying for bail.

'My client maintains his innocence and we look forward to the provision of a brief of evidence so we can move on with the court process,' he said.

'I've got instructions to make an application to the Supreme Court for bail in the weeks to come.'

Tostee's family were not present in court.

Gold Coast regional crime squad commander, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, said there were two people in the apartment prior to Ms Wright's fall - 'Mr Tostee and Warriena'.

Ms Wright, a New Zealand bank worker, was near the end of a trip to the Gold Coast for a friend's wedding when she met her fate.

Tostee has been remanded in custody until October 10 for the murder of Ms Wright.

Tostee did not appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning - the day after he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - and Magistrate John Costanzo adjourned Tostee's matter until October 10.

In the week leading up to Tostee's arrest, detectives kept his flat as a crime scene during the week while they made extensive forensic examinations of the unit.

On Wednesday, police in a cherry picker were raised up the Avalon building to take forensic samples from the outside of the balcony and other apartments on the way down.

Days later, detectives arrested Tostee at his parents' Carrara home on the Gold Coast and took him to the Southport watchhouse, where he charged with the murder of Ms Wright - exactly a week after she plummeted to her death.

Ms Wright had travelled from her native New Zealand for a two-week holiday and attend a former work colleague's wedding.
