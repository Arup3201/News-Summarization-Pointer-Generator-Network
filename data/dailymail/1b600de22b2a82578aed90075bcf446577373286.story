It was either a piece of audacious skill or simply outrageous luck but England Under 18 captain Ryan Ledson wasn't going to quibble.

The rising star curled home a quite ridiculous 40-yard free-kick in England's 4-1 win over Poland on Monday to enhance his burgeoning reputation.

With the scored in Gdansk locked at 1-1 in the 49th minute, Everton star Ledson stepped up to deliver a free-kick wide on the left.

England (4-1-2-1-2): Sam Howes (West Ham United), Callum Connolly (Everton), Taylor Moore (RC Lens), Jake Clarke-Salter (Chelsea), Max Lowe (Derby County); Liam Walsh (Everton); Ryan Ledson (captain; Everton), Josh Onomah (Tottenham Hotspur); Sheyi Ojo (Liverpool), Adam Armstrong (Newcastle United), Dominic Solanke (Chelsea).

Substitutions: Karlan Ahearne-Grant (Charlton Athletic) for Armstrong 58; Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Arsenal) for Ledson 72; Kyle Walker-Peters (Tottenham Hotspur) for Connolly 72; Marcus Rashford (Manchester United) for Ojo 83; Josh Sims (Southampton) for Onomah 83

Substitutes not used: Fred Woodman (Newcastle United), Tosin Adarabioyo (Manchester City)

Scorers: Solanke 11; Ledson 50; Ojo 52, 71

There were plenty of his white-shirted team-mates inside the box but Ledson struck the ball with such venom and swerve that it went over them all and left goalkeeper Mateusz Piechowiak red-faced as it flew over him.

Ledson, 17, was born and bred in Liverpool has been at Everton since the age of five. He captained England's Under 17 team to victory in the European Championships earlier this year and earned a call-up to Neil Dewsnip's Under 18s at the start of this season.

The match was his fourth appearance at this standard and the free-kick was his first goal.

Roberto Martinez twice named Ledson on the Everton bench towards the end of last season - against Southampton and Manchester City - though he didn't make an appearance.

He has, however, been a regular for the club's under 21 side over the last couple of years, maintaining his high standards despite coming up against players much older than him.

Ledson likens his style to England legend Frank Lampard - which can be no bad thing - and rates Leighton Baines as the Everton player he most enjoys watching.

England's 4-1 win at the MOSiR Lechia Gdansk stadium completed back-to-back successes over over Poland this week.

The hosts took the lead after 10 minutes when Kevin Pytlik thundered home a 30-yard strike after England failed to properly clear a corner.

England levelled within a minute, however, when Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke raced onto a rebound and found the net from a tight angle despite the attentions of three covering defenders.

The Young Lions seized control of the contest but didn't go in front until Ledson's free-kick sailed in five minutes after the break.

After that, it was the turn of another Merseyside-based player, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo, to shine.

He first won a penalty after Piechowiak tripped him in the box and converted it himself. Then, on 71 minutes, he fired into the bottom corner from 20 yards to set the seal on England's impressive win.
