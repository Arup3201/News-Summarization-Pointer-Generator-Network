Technology used to understand distant planets has helped reconstruct two ornate Tudor tombs that were destroyed during King Henry VIII's anti-Catholic offensive.

The tombs were commissioned by Thomas Howard, the third Duke of Norfolk, in the 16th century for Thetford Priory in Norfolk and when the priory was dissolved in 1540, some parts of the tombs were salvaged while others were abandoned in the ruins until they were excavated in the 1930s.

The Space Research Centre, part of the 
Leicester Department of Physics and Astronomy used these artefacts, along with drawings and 3D computer scanning technology that is currently used to construct how planets would have looked, to virtually reassemble two of the Howard Tombs.

This image shows what one of the Howard Tombs, designed for Thetford Priory in Norfolk in the 16th Century, would have looked like if it had been completed. The Space Research Centre, at Leicester University used artefacts, along with drawings and 3D computer scanning technology to virtually construct the tombs

In 1540, Thetford Priory was dissolved before the tombs could be finished and although some parts were salvaged other parts were abandoned in the ruins of the priory, pictured

The tombs were commissioned by Thomas Howard, the third Duke of Norfolk, in the 16th century for Thetford Priory in Norfolk.

The Duke, who was the uncle of two of 
Henry VIII's ill-fated wives, Ann Boleyn and Catherine Howard, wanted 
one of the tombs for himself.

The other was reserved for Henry VIII's illegitimate son, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond.

But
after Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic Church, creating a 
Church of England separate from papal rule, he dissolved monasteries, 
friaries and priories across the country.

During this time, Thomas Howard fell from favour and was only saved from death because Henry himself died the night before Howard's scheduled execution.

Part of the virtual construction process involved using various artefacts from museums across the country and piecing them together. Once the tomb was virtually constructed, the team at Leicester University, disassembled it, pictured, in order to see how it would have been created

‘Our exhibition studies the catastrophic
effects of the Dissolution of Thetford Priory and of Henry VIII's 
attempted destruction of Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, on the 
ducal tomb-monuments at Thetford,’ said Dr Phillip Lindley, of the 
University of Leicester’s Department of the History of Art and Film.

‘Using 3D laser scanning and 3D prints, we have - virtually - dismantled the monuments at Framlingham and recombined them with the parts left at Thetford in 1540, to try to reconstruct the monuments as they were first intended, in a mixture of the virtual and the real.

‘The museum is a few hundred yards from the priory site where the tomb-monuments were first carved nearly five hundred years ago.

‘The Ancient House is itself a Tudor building and it is a surprising thought that the original sculptors probably walked past the very building in which we are now exhibiting their work.’

Leicester University worked with Oxford and Yale universities as well as the English Heritage and the Norfolk Museums and Archaeology Service.

The research was part of a study by the ‘Representing Re-Formation’ project team.

It was funded by a grant from the Science and Heritage Programme.

The parts of the tombs that weren't abandoned were taken away and used to form another tomb, using different materials.

This tomb can now be found in the St Michael's Church, 
Framlingham, Suffolk.

When the priory was dissolved, some artefacts were taken and used to construct a different tomb, using different materials. This tomb, pictured, is currently located at the St Michael's Church, Framlingham, Suffolk

Some parts were salvaged and later finished off in a different style
