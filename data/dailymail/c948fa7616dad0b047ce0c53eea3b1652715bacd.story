On the surface, Hannah Kritzeck is just like any other teenage girl who loves singing, ballet and dancing to hip-hop.

But unlike her peers, Hannah from Minnesota, was born with primordial dwarfism and is just 39 inches tall.

The 19-year-old suffers from the extremely rare condition that only affects about 100 people in the world.

The form of dwarfism causes short stature and health problems, including the threat of brain aneurysms and a shortened life-span.

As well as dealing with typical teenage challenges, Hannah also has to bravely face the reality of her condition.

A new film follows Hannah as she prepares for graduation from high school, choosing a career, dreaming about boys and finding a date for her school prom.

The bubbly teen, who weighs just over two stone, also spends her free time taking hip-hop and ballet classes and has her own voice coach.

Hannah's condition affects only 100 people in the whole world and causes short stature and health problems, including the threat of brain aneurysms and a shortened life-span. Pictured: with her mother Jackie

Hannah says that as a child she was always aware that she was different to her siblings 

Hannah, who was adopted by Jackie and Larry Kritzeck at birth, says that she was aware of her condition from a young age.

'Growing up I always knew I was different from my brothers, Mark and Matt, and my sister, Kelly, who were average height.'

However, Hannah says that she was never made to feel alienated as her loving family adapted their routine to suit her height.  

'My mom and dad still made sure I had a normal childhood though.

'They lowered all the light switches and put stools in the bathroom and kitchen because I can't reach the counter and sinks.'

The 19-year-old refuses to let her condition get in the way of her passion for dancing 

One of Hannah's biggest dreams is to fall in love and to start a family 

But she soon learned her normal teenage experiences were going to be different from those of her friends.

She said: 'I go shopping with my friends but finding clothes that fit me is extremely difficult.

'I always have to get my clothes tailored or in a kids size - I can't buy high heeled shoes like my other friends.'

Hannah says that her height can often prevent her being treated as an adult. 

'Everyone thinks I'm five years old when they see me and it's frustrating because I'm not a baby.'

Hannah says that she doesn't want her height to prevent her from having a normal and happy life and she has the same hopes and aspirations as any other girl her age.  

'Just because I'm smaller, doesn't mean I'm any different.

'Looking to the future, I'd like to get married and have my own family. I would like to have two kids, a boy and a girl.'

Hannah says that all of her friends have boyfriends and she would love to meet someone herself

Hannah's condition comes with many medical issues and she needs regular monitoring, including annual MRI scans to check for the possibility of brain aneurysms. And because her teeth and mouth are so small she has dental implants.

The student also developed scoliosis and had two titanium rods placed in her back when she was young.

But despite the limitations posed by her condition, Hannah has never let it get in the way of her real passion, dancing.

Hannah, who has been dancing since she was a toddler, says she finds it relaxing and acts as a release from her condition.  

'I've been dancing since I was two years old, and took gymnastics at three.

'I love dancing because it makes me feel good - hip hop makes me feel strong and ballet calms me down.'

As well as dreams of becoming a dancer, just like many other teenage girls, Hannah is looking for love.

A new film Little and Looking for Love for follow Hannah's journey on the road to romance 

She said: 'Lots of my friends have boyfriends - I'd like to have a boyfriend, and I believe in romance - but I just haven't got it yet.

'My ideal man would be someone with blue eyes, brown hair, and a Mohawk - and someone who would protect me.' 

But Hannah's mother, Jackie, 63, still worries about her health and finds it hard to think about her daughter's future.

She said: 'The risks are always going to be there and yes that does worry me a lot.

'Hannah does have a dream to have her own family to have a husband to have a child

'I guess delving into her life expectancy is a hard thing. I don't like to talk about it but do need to face it.

'We're just going to I've each day like there isn't one tomorrow. That's all you can do. Live to the fullest.'

And while under no illusions about the seriousness of her condition, Hannah doesn't dwell on it.

She said: 'My advice to anyone living with the condition would be to never give up on your dream, and keep trying.'

Little And Looking for Love is on Wednesday February 11, 9pm, on TLC
