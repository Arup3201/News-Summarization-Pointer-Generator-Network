One naked neighbor has set off a flurry of complaints in the Charlotte community where he lives, but police are telling residents there's nothing they can do about it.

Homeowners in Cardinal Glen in north Charlotte claim that a man in the neighborhood has often stood stark naked in the doorway of his home over the last 10 years. 

Those flustered residents have tried to phone the police, only to be told that the nude man next door isn't actually breaking any laws.

Stark raving mad: Neighbors in Cardinal Glenn 

'Because my daughter grew up in this neighborhood,' Adrienna Harris told WBTV about her growing agitation.

'Even this week, when she was home from spring break, she would call me at work and say "Mom, I'm getting ready to go outside, but let me check if he's out there first." That's how bad it is in the neighborhood.'

Harris says she called police several times in the past, and every time has been informed the man has done nothing wrong.

On Friday, people in the neighborhood, including Pecolia Threatt, tried the police one more time. 

'I was out rolling the trash can on Friday and I just happened to look over there and he was standing there buck naked,' Threatt said.

A Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department spokeswoman confirmed that police were called Friday, but that charges have ever been filed.

'Since it is not a criminal incident, it was documented in the "call for service" but there is no report,' the official told the Observer.

The spokeswoman also told the paper that officers had spoken with the magistrate, who agreed with the officers that the man was not violating any laws since he was on his property.

Indecent exposure laws vary state by state, but North Carolina's states outlines it as 'willfully expos[ing] the private parts of his or her person in any public place.'

Residents in the neighborhood said they took videos and photos of the man, in order to present a case for a nuisance complaint to the Homeowners Association.
