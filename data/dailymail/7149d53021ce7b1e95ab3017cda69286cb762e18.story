Cesc Fabregas told Arsenal fans they would be in his heart 'forever' after helping Chelsea beat the Gunners 2-0 at Stamford Bridge.

Eden Hazard gave Chelsea a first-half lead after being brought down in the box by Laurent Koscielny and, although Arsenal pressed for an equaliser, they were eventually punished on the counter attack - Fabregas provided an inch-perfect pass for Diego Costa to finish. 

When asked whether the victory was sweeter was because some fans had booed him, Fabregas told Sky: 'No. Not at all. I have huge respect for Arsenal. They gave me everything when I was little.

Fabregas said that although he had huge respect for Arsenal he was committed to Chelsea

'Without them I know I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have won what I've won. I respect the fans I take it in a positive way I know they love me. 

It's all because we were together one day. Sometimes for circumstances these things can happen.

'I've always said it, I'm not scared and they will always be in my heart forever but now, this is football, I'm in this fantastic football club. 

'I'm playing with great players, with a great coach and with great fans and I want to win everything. 

'I'm hungry. I really want to do well for this club and I hope I can make it in the future.' 

The win cements Chelsea's position at the top of the Premier League table while Arsenal drop down to seventh.
