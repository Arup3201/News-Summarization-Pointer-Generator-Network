Clipping the eight barrier in the 110 metres hurdles proved the difference for William Sharman on Tuesday night, as the 29-year-old had to settle for Commonwealth silver once again.

Frustration was etched over Sharman’s face as he watched a replay and realised just how close he had come to winning the Commonwealth title: just four- hundredths of a second, squandered after he was knocked slightly off balance after hurdle eight.

Jamaica’s Andrew Riley, a much quicker sprinter over the flat, drove to gold to Sharman’s right in the final metres as the Englishman finished second in 13.36secs.

Sharman also won a silver behind England’s Andy Turner four years ago in Delhi and, following the withdrawal of world No1 Hansle Parchment of Jamaica, this was the classically trained pianist’s big chance to win a major title.

Speaking on the BBC, 400m world record-holder Michael Johnson said: ‘It’s a shame for Will Sharman. I think he knows he’ll never be a world champion and that was probably his opportunity of a gold medal on the big stage.’

Lawrence Clarke, a bronze medallist in 2010, finished last in the final and earlier on Tuesday Turner experienced one of his most ‘devastating days on the track’ when he crashed out in qualifying.

The defending champion, 33, hit the first and second hurdles and failed to complete the race in what could well be his last season on the track.

But where a silver for Sharman will always prompt thoughts of what might have been, England’s Laura Samuel was deservedly delighted by her second place in the triple jump.

The 23-year-old from Leicester delivered the performance of her career so far, leaping 14.09metres —34 centimetres beyond her 2012 personal best — in the second round to seal silver behind Kimberly  Williams from Jamaica, who jumped 14.21m.

There was also a third silver medal for England at Hampden Park on Tuesday night, as Ashley Bryant came second in the decathlon. The 23-year-old was third going into the final event, the gruelling 1500m, but finished nine second ahead of Kurt Felix of Grenada to take silver behind Damian Warner of Canada.

It was a fitting comeback for the decathlete, who scored 8,109 points, after he was forced to pull out of last year’s World Championships in Moscow with a hamstring tear.

Greg Rutherford, the only remaining London 2012 gold medallist competing for England at Hampden Park, reached Wednesday night's long jump final with his first qualifying jump of 8.05m on Tuesday  morning, but admitted he was ‘held together by tape’.

The 27-year-old pulled out of two warm-up events prior to the Commonwealths to prevent any further damage to a knee injury and did not sound convincing when asked his fitness.

Rutherford, who joins Englishmen Chris Tomlinson and JJ Jegede in the final, said: ‘I’m in pretty good form — held together by tape, but feeling pretty good.‘(The knee) is fine. I’m here, I jumped and it’s okay. You manage these things and I’m feeling pretty good.

‘I should do well at these Games and if I don’t it’s a huge disappointment. I’m here to do well and that’s what I expect.’

Jersey sent a three-strong table tennis team to the Games for the first time.

But Craig Gascoyne showed his inexperience at 3-1 down to Mohamed Shakirin Ibrahim of Malaysia in his first match.

‘I thought it was the best of five games,’ said Gascoyne, 30.

‘I didn’t realise it was seven. I was about to shake hands!’

Ibrahim didn’t have to wait long for a handshake, taking the next game and the match.

Olympic champion and world record-holder David Rudisha was the fastest qualifier for Wednesday's 800m semi-finals, but there was disappointment for London 2012 finalist Andrew Osagie.

The Englishman was disqualified for cutting across Wales’ Joe Thomas as the pair jostled for position in the final metres.

Osagie said: ‘There was a scuffle and there were people looking for gaps that weren’t there.‘I would say it was not his space and you can always go round people. If you don’t you will cause a collision.

‘That happened to me at the trials and somebody clipped my hamstring, and that has affected me coming into these championships.’
