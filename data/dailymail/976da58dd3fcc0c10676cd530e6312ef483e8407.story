Heads bowed in terror the orange-clad Kurdish fighters are paraded through streets filled with jeering militants in the latest horrifying video release from Islamic State.

In a grim echo of the terrible fate which befell Jordanian pilot Lieutenant Muath al-Kaseasbeh the captives, reportedly Peshmerga fighters, are dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled in cages. 

Just as Lt. al-Kaseasbeh was burned alive on camera, IS are planning to do the same with their latest prisoners, according to posts on social media.

Each prisoner was accompanied by black clad and flag waving jihadis, some armed with AK-47s

Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh is pictured about to be burned to death in a horrific film released by ISIS. There are fears the Kurdish prisoners in the latest release could meet the same dreadful fate

The grim procession apparently took place through Kirkuk in northwest Iraq, an oil rich Kurdish stronghold where ISIS now has a presence after mounting repeated attacks in recent weeks.

The parade, reportedly through the Hawija district in the southwest of Kirkuk, could be seen as revenge for horrific reports of Kurdish forces dragging the bodies of ISIS fighters through the streets of the city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq earlier this month.

In the nearly four minute long video 17 of the Iraqi Kurdistan military forces are driven one by one on the backs of white pick-up trucks with ISIS flag-waving militants toting AK-47s accompanying each prisoner. 

At the end of the clip the long line of cages can be seen retreating into the sunset over the heads of massed crowds of militants. 

A total of 17 Peshmerga were led through the streets of what is apparently Kirkuk in northwestern Iraq

Posts on social media suggested the Islamic State militants plan to set fire to the Kurdistan warriors

Lt. al-Kaseasbeh was filmed being burned to death by Islamic State extremists in a nightmarish 22-minute film which was expertly edited before being posted online.

Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', it showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight.

It is thought he was immolated while heavily sedated before debris, including broken masonry, is poured over the cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer. 

Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the captured pilot. 

After the footage was released, Jordanian officials  executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS.

They included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. 

Thousands of Jordanian troops have been deployed to the country's border with Iraq to stop Islamic State militants from infilatrating the country, it has been reported.

The country has already carried out airstrikes on ISIS targets in revenge for the murder of their pilot. 

Iraqi security forces  killed eight ISIS assailants wearing Iraqi army uniforms during an attack against the Ain al-Asad air base, where 320 US Marines are currently training Iraqi troops

Al-Baghdadi is only nine miles away from the air base, where Iraqi officials had to call for reinforcements

The latest procession of captives scene played out against the backdrop of ISIS taking the town of Al-Baghdadi in western Iraq.

The fall of the town, which the Pentagon played down as a minor setback, came as IS extremists launched an unsuccessful assault involving suicide bombers on the nearby Al-Asad air base.

'We do assess that right now they have control of Al-Baghdadi,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told a news conference, adding IS took hold of the town 'in the past several days.'

The town is located in Anbar province, about five miles (eight kilometers) from the Asad air base, where about 300 US Marines are stationed to assist Iraqi government troops.

Iraqi soldiers repelled the IS group's assault on the base on Friday which involved several suicide bombers, officials said.

A group of 20-25 IS fighters, most of them wearing Iraqi army uniforms, carried out the failed attack, which appeared designed to have been an initial wave of suicide bombings followed by gunmen storming in, Kirby said.

All of the militants were killed or died when detonating suicide bombs.

No US military serve members were under direct threat from the attack, as they were several miles away, but two Iraqi soldiers were killed and several were wounded

Kirby said that 'at no time were US troops anywhere near the fighting,' which was about two miles away from where the Americans were working at the sprawling complex.

American surveillance aircraft tracking the IS extremists assisted the Iraqi army forces and Apache attack helicopters were sent in but did open fire, officials said.

US-led coalition aircraft carried out five air strikes in the area over the past 24 hours, roughly 15 kilometers from the Asad base, but those were not related to the brief firefight with the IS militants at Asad, officials said.

'There were no aircraft involved in beating back this,' Kirby said. 'The Iraqi security forces did this on their own.'

An Iraqi army colonel and a defense ministry official said the botched attack involved at least seven would-be suicide bombers using a military vehicle. 

Al-Baghdadi had been under growing pressure for months and was one of the few towns that had remained under the Iraqi government's control in the predominantly Sunni province.

But the Pentagon said the capture of the town did not represent a major setback in the war effort against the Islamists who have overrun large areas of Iraq and Syria.

'This is arguably the first in at least a couple of months, if not more, where they (IS) have had any success at all at taking any new ground,' Kirby said.

'So this is an enemy that we still assess to be in a defensive posture.'

He added: 'It's one town. It's not all of Anbar. It's not all of Iraq.

'We need to keep it in perspective.'

US officials have said it will take some time before Iraqi troops are trained and ready to stage a major counter-offensive in Anbar province, where much of the Sunni population has become alienated from the Shiite-led leadership in Baghdad.

Washington is pinning its hopes on Iraqi government plans to build up a militia among the Sunni tribes in the area against the IS jihadists.

On Wednesday President Obama formally requested from Congress the authority to use military force in the war against ISIS.

The proposal does not ask for the deployment of ground troops.

During a press conference the president said: 'Our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to lose.'
