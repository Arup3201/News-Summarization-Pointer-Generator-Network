There's barely enough room to bend down and pick up a cat, let alone swing it.

And with the front of this house measuring just six feet across, it could be hard to get much furniture through the front door.

The two-bedroom semi-detached is so small, the new owners can reach out and touch both side walls at the same time.

Built in 1917 on the side of a regular house, the tiny dwelling in Redruth, Cornwall, has gone on sale for £119,950.

The narrowest part of the entrance hall and the second bedroom above it measures just 6ft 1in in width.

It’s a whole foot thinner than a home in London recently dubbed ‘Britain’s narrowest’ that’s on the market for £250,000.

The two-storey property now opens up at the rear into a slightly more spacious lounge with a bedroom above.

It was originally built in 1917 on the side of a regular house as servant's quarters

It also manages to cram in two reception rooms, a fitted kitchen and a garden overlooking the rural parish of Carn Brea.

Lisa Chirtwin, whose family have owned the Cornish dwelling for 30 years, insists it’s not quite as small as it looks thanks to an L-shaped extension that was put up in 1991.

She said: ‘It was built in 1917 and was used as servants’ quarters.

‘There were bells in the house when it came to our ownership 30 years ago but they were taken out when it was renovated.’

The owner said: 'It’s quite a light and airy home but cosy at the same time'

She added: ‘The house was extended in 1991 to an L-shaped layout at the back so it is actually quite a big property.’

A spokesman for Miller Countrywide said the property was great value for money.

Sally Johns said: ‘It’s quite a light and airy home but cosy at the same time. It has lovely views of Carn Brea.

‘The front aspect of the property is very deceptive and when you step in it leads to a widespread living area.

‘It is rare for us to come across a property like this, or one designed in this way, because many of the homes we sell have been kept as one property or split in two equal-sized homes.’
