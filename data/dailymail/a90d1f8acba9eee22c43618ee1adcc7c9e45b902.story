With our shared interests and notorious 'special relationship', it is often thought that Britons and Americans are cut from the same cloth.

However, a new survey has revealed that people from both sides of the Atlantic have wildly different personalities.

Up to 20,000 Britons and Americans took part in a visual personality test which involved selecting which image they most identified with in certain categories.

And, as well as confirming some long-held stereotypes, it also appears to confirm that the famous British stiff upper lip still exists.

Differences: Americans like singer Beyonce , right, are more likely to be 'caring' or 'energetic optimists' . The study found that British people, such as Keira Knightley, left, are likely to be more reserved

As reported by The Times, Americans are more likely to be  'caring' or 'energetic optimists' while Britons are twice as likely to be described as 'downhearted'.

However, Britons also emerged as more likely to be chilled out.

Some of the more revealing insights from the survey, by Visual DNA, came when Britons and Americans were asked about romance.

Briton's are more reserved and less likely to share romantic secrets with friends, family and colleagues.

Americans, however, are four times 
more likely to be called a 'true romantic'. They are more flirtatious 
and much more likely to take a sexual attitude towards love.

British people, on the other hand, are five times more likely to be called 'more reserved'.

Stiff upper lip: British people, such as Sir Michael Caine, are five times more likely to be called 'more reserved' than Americans

The survey results appear to confirm what actor Michael Caine once famously said.

'I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations.

'English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don't interfere in your situation.

'If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.'

Another intriguing insight into attitudes came when people were asked about money.

British people are three times more likely to be described as 'careful spenders' or 'home improvers' than their counterparts in the U.S.

However, Americans display almost entirely opposite characteristics. They are 13 times more likely to 'flash their cash' and show off their money.
