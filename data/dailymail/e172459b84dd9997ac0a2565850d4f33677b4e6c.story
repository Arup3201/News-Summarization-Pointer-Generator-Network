Councils will be banned from using spy cameras to impose parking tickets under a crackdown on town halls that wage war against drivers.

The plans will also see motorists get compensation for unfair fines.

Ministers are to change the law to prevent local authorities using CCTV – intended to catch serious criminals – to boost their coffers by monitoring motorists who park in the wrong place.

Councils will be banned from using spy cameras to impose parking tickets on motorists

Under the proposals unveiled today, those who have been targeted incorrectly and win an appeal will get double their money back – with compensation payments equal to the original fine.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles will also order a review of the spread of yellow lines amid complaints that parking restrictions in town centres have been imposed ‘over-zealously’ and are killing high street stores.

The crackdown includes previously announced plans to extend the grace period for motorists before they get a parking ticket from five minutes to 15.

Nine million parking fines are issued every year by town halls in England – even though there are only 19 million cars on the roads – and the scale of fines has soared to more than £1.3billion a year, double the amount when Labour came to power in 1997.

Review: A traffic warden in action

Some 75 councils in England use static CCTV cameras and there are 102 cars equipped with spy cameras used for parking enforcement.

Campaign group Big Brother Watch found 10.7 million fines have been issued over the past five years, costing motorists more than £300million.

Councils in England are forecast to make £635million net profit from parking charges and parking fines this year, nearly 6 per cent up on 2012. Drivers appeal against 1.3 million parking tickets every year, with 660,000 winning, but parking adjudicators have no powers to award compensation for the hassle or distress if a council wrongly imposes a parking fine.

Mr Pickles plans to change secondary legislation to give them the same powers as the Planning Inspectorate, which can award compensation when councils act unreasonably.

‘Compensation would act as a deterrent to councils,’ a senior  government source said. ‘The amount would be of a similar level to the fine.’

Mr Pickles and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will announce the changes at the Conservative Party conference, in a bid to show voters that the Tories are tackling the rising cost of living.

Mr Pickles said: ‘The last Labour  government told councils to hammer hard-working people with higher parking charges and unfair parking fines.

‘We want to rein in these over-zealous and unfair rules on parking enforcement, so it focuses on supporting high streets and motorists, not raising money.’

One in three councils is earning more money from parking and service charges than council tax, a study has revealed.

A
total of £10.2billion was made by local authorities by charging for 
parking, school meals, funerals and other domestic services between 2011
and 2012.

The Audit 
Commission said some councils are using the charges to boost their 
income after the Coalition put a freeze on council tax rises.

The
public spending watchdog revealed that ‘stealth tax’ charges for 
services paid for a fifth of district councils’ spending. In London, 
Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Wandsworth had incomes that 
outstripped spending on equivalent domestic services.

Woking Borough Council in Surrey made the most  from charges, using them to raise 87 per cent of its annual spending.

Local
government minister Brandon Lewis said councils should not be 
‘hammering’ residents with stealth taxes, adding: ‘In particular, we 
believe more should be done to protect residents from excessive parking 
charges and unfair parking fines.’

He said parking spy cars were ‘a step too far’ adding: ‘Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle crime, not to raise money for council coffers.’

Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Arbitrary 
parking rules force shoppers online or to out-of-town stores, causing 
lasting damage to local firms and small shops.’

Residents
and businesses will be able to petition councils to start a review of 
yellow lines, with a view to creating more short-term waiting bays, to 
allow people to pop into local shops whilst avoiding all-day parking 
charges.

Tony Ball, of the Local Government 
Association which represents councils, said: ‘Parking controls are not 
about revenue raising, they  are absolutely essential for keeping the 
roads clear and making sure people can park near their homes and local 
shops.

‘Camera
cars have been instrumental in keeping children from being hurt or 
killed … and CCTV plays an important role elsewhere in monitoring 
traffic flow and keeping cars moving.'

But the Government won support from 
pressure groups. Nick Pickles, of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Councils are
cashing in on CCTV because it’s not catching crooks.

'They’re turning them on residents to fill their coffers and justify the expensive systems they’ve bought.’
