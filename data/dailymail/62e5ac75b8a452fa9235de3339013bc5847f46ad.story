The Duchess of Cambridge's stylish sister showed off her fashion credentials once again in a summery outfit for lunch yesterday.

Pippa Middleton, 30, wore a flirty forties-inspired polka-dot playsuit which featured black cap sleeves, lapel and waistline detailing.

Thrifty Pippa recycled the the taupe outfit from Whistles' AW 2010 collection, pairing it with a sensible pair of gold flat pumps and a matching tote.

A similar style currently retails at £135 on the High Street label's website.

Pippa spent the day out with a friend in London before sitting down with her for some lunch in the sunshine.

The
 royal sibling, who was spotted enjoying the tennis from the Royal box 
with her brother James last week, was indulging in an altogether more 
low key affair as she was spotted deep in conversation with her pal as 
they took their time over a bite to eat.

A waiter was seen bringing a tray of zesty drinks over to their table and the pair indulged in food and drink over their chat.

Part way through their meal Pippa put her shiny hair up into a low, understated ponytail.

She recently completed a marathon 3,000-mile Race Across America bike challenge with her brother James for charity, and her summery outfit allowed Pippa to show off results of her hard work.

Her arms looked toned to perfection, with well-sculpted shoulders and triceps clearly showing as she clasped her handbag.
