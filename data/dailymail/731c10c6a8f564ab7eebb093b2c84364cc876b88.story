'Most loving boy': Nathan Harrison, four, died during a house fire at his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on Monday

The parents of a four-year-old boy who died in a house fire have said their 'beautiful' son was 'the most loving, happy sweet child'.

Nathan Harrison passed away in hospital following the blaze in a bedroom at his family home in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on Monday.

His ten-year-old brother Matthew was also taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, but his condition is said to be ‘not life-threatening’.

Nathan’s mother Jodie Collins, who is believed to have raised the alarm after the fire broke out, said: 'Our beautiful boy Nathan was the most loving, happy sweet child and he loved everybody. He was the closest person to Matthew, his brother, and now he has sadly gone.'

Emergency services were called to the detached property on Monday afternoon after smoke was seen rising from a bedroom window.

It is thought Nathan breathed in a 'considerable amount' of fumes, and despite desperate attempts by paramedics to save him, he later died in hospital.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

Nathan’s father, Chris Harrison, said: 'We all loved Nathan dearly. We are all distraught. He was a beautiful little boy. We will miss him.'

Neighbour Julie Mitchell, 35, has today told of the moment the boy’s mother raised the alarm.

‘She came round calling for help. She was screaming for her little boy,’ said Ms Mitchell.

‘The fire brigade turned up and ambulance took him away on a stretcher.

‘I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep seeing his little boy coming out of the house. It’s so sad, he was the same age as my little girl.

‘He and his brother were just cheeky little blond haired boys. They would play football together in the garden.

‘I didn’t 
know them as they had only been here for a couple of months, but my 
heart goes out to them. It must be so painful for the whole family.’

The
 two boys had been brought out of the house by the time police arrived 
and both were taken to hospital with serious injuries from smoke 
inhalation, West Yorkshire Police said.

Investigation: A forensic officer is seen walking to the house in Keighley, West Yorkshire, to try and determine the cause of the fire

Scene: Nathan Harrison, died in hospital after inhaling fumes from the fire which began in the bedroom of his West Yorkshire family home

Probe: The emergency services are still trying to establish the cause of the fire which started on Monday

Emergency services were called to a 
house in Keighley, near Bradford, after smoke 
was seen coming from a rear bedroom at the property in Sunnyhill Grove.

A woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘There was flashing lights everywhere.

‘There were three fire engines, two ambulances and a first responder.

‘We could see smoke coming out of the upstairs window, but then we saw this little boy coming out on a stretcher.

‘It was such a sad sight to see. No parent should have to go through that.

‘We didn’t know the family but we would see the boys playing outside together, with not a care in the world.

‘It must have been terrible for him, but I hope he is now at peace.’

The cause of the fire, which was confined to the bedroom, is being investigated.

The
 fire service confirmed that the property was fitted with two smoke 
alarms, but it is still being investigated as to whether they were 
operational at the time the fire broke out.

‘The ten-year-old is now recovering from his injuries which are not life-threatening. Sadly, the four-year-old died in hospital.

‘The cause of the fire which was contained to the back bedroom, remains under investigation. Initial enquiries are underway with the colleagues form the police, and are at a very early stage.

‘Clearly this has been a tragic incident in which a young child has lost his life and a full investigation will be carried out.’
