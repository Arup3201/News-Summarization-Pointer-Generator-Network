Shoppers visiting the Iceland where Jacqueline Illingworth works often remark on her striking similarity to another friendly female employee at the supermarket.

But there is one crucial difference - the other woman was a size 26, while Jacqueline is a toned size 12.

Most customers can hardly believe their eyes when the 23-year-old admits they are the same person.

Dramatic change: Jacqueline Illingworth embarked on a dedicated weightloss regime after she developed chest pains as a result of her junk food diet

The mother of one has lost nearly half her body weight, after the birth of her daughter opened her eyes to the dangers of her unhealthy lifestyle.

Jacqueline had long been known for her outgoing personality and colourful make-up among customers at the store in Fallowfield, Manchester.

But inside, she was unhappy about her size.

By the time she was pregnant with daughter Scarlett, now three, a junk food diet of kebabs, chocolate and fry-ups had left her weighing 23 stone.

She was so heavy, she had become unable to walk even short distances without suffering from shooting chest pains.

A difficult labour and the death of her father left her determined to shed the pounds.

So after the birth of her daughter, Jacqueline joined a gym and embarked on a dedicated weightloss regime joined a gym - losing an amazing 11 stone.

Larger than life: Jacqueline had long been known for her outgoing personality, but since embarking on her fitness programme, she now feels truly happy inside

Jacqueline, from Stockport, said: 'After I gave birth and my dad died, I was basically a mess.

'I was the heaviest I’d ever been and just didn’t want to leave the house - my head was all over the place. Eventually, a friend suggested I started going to the gym with her.

'I started on the cross trainer and built up from there.

'I was sick of my size, which I’d always hated but never done anything about before.

'But I realised if I didn’t lose weight, I wasn’t going be around for my daughter when I was 30.

'Now I’m back at work, customers come in and say I remind them of someone called Jacqueline who used to work there, or ask if I’m her sister.

'I have to tell them it’s still me.'

Jacqueline’s gym, Energy Box at Levenshulme High School, has now given her a year’s free membership in honour of her hard work.

Facilities manager Mark Mutch said: 'Jacqueline’s always been a larger than life character, but now it’s just in terms of her personality.'
