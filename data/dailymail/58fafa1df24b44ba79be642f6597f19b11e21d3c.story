Samir Nasri's girlfriend has launched an extraordinary outburst after the Manchester City midfielder was left out of the France World Cup squad.

The 26-year-old has fallen out of favour under Didier Deschamps - thought to be due to disciplinary reasons - and Anara Atanes made her feelings known on Twitter.

She posted: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!'

City team-mate Gael Clichy has also missed the cut, though many Premier League players have been included.

Bacary Sagna, Laurent Koscielny, Olivier Giroud, Hugo Lloris, Loic Remy, Mathieu Debuchy, Moussa Sissoko and Patrice Evra are in the 23-man squad, while Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin is on standby.

Nasri joined in on the social media act later in the evening, posting: 'Thank you for all your messages of support, that's life, another world cup at home to realize what does not kill makes you stronger.'

And he even replied to his girlfriend: 'Love you dont get upset life sometimes is unfair but you have to accept it and deal with it.'

Deschamps was questioned about the high-profile omission during his press conference on Tuesday, and doubted Nasri's international credentials.

'He has important status with Manchester City because he starts, which is not the case today in the France team.'

But Atanes accused the manager of a lack of respect.

'Lets just get this straight! Im not mad i get my bf for 2 months.... I just think theres a level of respect to be had!' she tweeted, before later posting: '#ShouldOfBeenSpanish'

In interviews leading up to his World Cup snub, Nasri was reserved, acknowledging that it was unlikely he was going to be picked.

'I think the dye is cast. I respect [Didier Deschamps'] choice. I'll watch the World Cup on TV,' he told Canal+.

'If starting games in a club like Manchester City and winning two titles isn't enough, too bad, I won't regret anything.'

France are in Group E at the World Cup this summer, and kick off their tournament against Honduras on June 15.

Out: Gael Clichy will also not be involved, but Morgan Schneiderlin is on a seven-man standby list

Big man: Olivier Giroud makes the 23, along with Arsenal team-mates Bacary Sagna and Laurent Koscielny

Nasri was banned for three matches by the French FA during Euro 2012 after the playmaker launched an expletive-laden rant at reporters following France's quarter-final defeat by Spain.

He has played just six times since that tournament but club boss Manuel Pellegrini believes it's a mistake to leave Nasri out.

'The manager of France hasn't said about the list but I can't believe Samir Nasri won't be in it because he was one of the best players in the Premier League and very important for our squad,' Pellegrini said after the Premier League victory on Sunday.

'It will be an important mistake if he doesn't play in the World Cup.'

Snub: Nasri has barely featured since a three-game ban after Euro 2012 for swearing at reporters
