A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving today after his £100,000 Audi R8 was involved in a collision with a Ford Fiesta, leaving one woman dead and another fighting for her life.

Rescue teams, including police, firefighters and ambulance crews, rushed to the scene of the crash in Hall Green, Birmingham, after the collision at 11.30pm last night.

The pair in the Fiesta were taken to hospital, but the passenger, who was in her late forties, was pronounced dead on arrival.

'Crews and the doctor took over resuscitation attempts and continued advanced life support on the woman.

'Sadly, despite efforts, nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead on scene a short time later. The driver of the same car, a womanbelieved to be in her 50s, sustained a serious chest injury.

'The driver of the second car had left the scene prior to the arrival of the emergency services.'
