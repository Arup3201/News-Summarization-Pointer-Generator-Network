It's something we all do on a near daily basis, but could the reason behind those all-too-frequent 'bad hair days' be because you're washing your hair wrong?

The reason your hair feels silky soft after a visit to the salon isn't pure coincidence; it's because hairdressers are carefully trained to wash and condition hair using a tried-and-tested regime.

There is, in fact, a wrong way to wash your hair, and getting it wrong can take your hair from silky and shiny to totally lackluster and damaged.

FEMAIL called on the industry's hottest hairdressers to share their insider knowledge on what you're doing wrong and the simple steps  to make sure you do it right.

There is, in fact, a wrong way to wash your hair, and getting it wrong can take your hair from silky and shiny to totally lackluster and damaged. FEMAIL called on the best experts in the business to ensure you get it right

WASH HAIR CORRECTLY AND NEVER WITH HOT WATER

'I’m a great believer in looking after hair as we would our skin. It’s fine to wash your hair daily, you wouldn’t not wash your face every day, but there are some things to consider,' said Andrew Barton at Urban Retreat at Harrods.

 By working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out, it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths

Did you know that you only need to use product on your scalp and no necessarily the ends? By working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out, it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths.

Extreme care should be taken when washing your hair and while you may think scrubbing hard will thoroughly cleanse it, that couldn't be further from the truth.

Putting too much pressure on your scalp can actually result in greasier hair. As Barton explains: 'Don’t rub your scalp too vigorously. This will encourage oil secretion from the sebaceous gland'.

Stylists also say it's imperative to rinse your hair for twice the amount of time as lathering on product and never use hot water.  

'Women often wash their hair with water which is too hot, thinking it will make hair cleaner,' said Barton. 

Washing your hair in tepid water is better for the follicles with the added bonus of saving money on your bills. 

'The hot water activates the sebaceous gland which secretes oil and can leave hair greasy soon after washing. Use warm, tepid water for ultra clean hair and to extend the life of your blow dry.'  

DON'T RELY ON JUST ONE SHAMPOO 

Thought a standard shampoo will give you the hair of your dreams? Wrong. 'We put our hair through a lot in the week, so as you might exfoliate your skin once a week to remove dead skin cells, washing hair with a clarifying shampoo will allow hair and scalp to breathe,' said Barton.

Use a clarifying shampoo, such as Pureology Purify, once a week to remove impurities and product build up.

When drying, avoid rubbing with towels, this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless, blot dry instead to prevent damage

Barton also believes it's essential to work scalp care treatments into your regime. 'This is where the nutrients are produced to support healthy hair growth,' he said.

Scalp care products such as Kérastase Initialiste and TRESemmé Renewal Hair & Scalp range can help leave hair feeling thicker, shinier and more resistant.

Industry experts also recommend getting a hacial - or hair facial - a few times a year.

Nioxin have launched Dermabrasion services for the scalp, which promise to remove build-up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation.

Aveda, meanwhile, have a Healthy Hair Service whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp's oil levels.

They then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair, which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. 

Issie Churcher, HOB Salons’ Creative Colour Director, also believes in the power of double shampooing and exfoliating. She explained: 'Investing in professional shampoo and conditioner such as a duo from the Wella SP or Nioxin range means washing your hair daily can be beneficial to a healthy scalp, aiding in hair growth.

'To achieve the best results from your shampoo, make sure hair is well saturated with water this will help in achieving the best lather, allowing the hair and scalp to be cleansed thoroughly.

'Two shampoos is advisable to make sure hair and scalp is thoroughly cleansed and always finish with a conditioner appropriate for your hair type and avoid conditioner on the scalp to prevent oily roots. 

DON'T RUB TOO HARD AND NEVER TOWEL DRY YOUR HAIR  

You may be in a rush but all hairdressers emphasise the importance of avoiding towel drying. 

'When drying, avoid rubbing with towels, this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless, blot dry instead to prevent damage,' said Issie Churcher. 

Dabbing your hair with the towel, followed by a quick squeeze to get rid of excess water is the way forward. 

It's also important to avoid combing your hair after you've showered and instead take a wide-toothed comb through locks whilst your in the shower waiting for your conditioner to work its magic. 

Never comb your hair straight after washing it, instead comb through it whilst the conditioner is setting in
