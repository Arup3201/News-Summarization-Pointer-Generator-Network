Brad Pitt fans might want to look away now.

Sarah Gilbertson from Liverpool beat 80,000 fellow Europeans to win the experience of a lifetime - a trip to New Orleans to attend an exclusive charity gala, meet Brad Pitt, and party alongside the likes of Bruno Mars and Kings of Leon.

Sarah, 25, took her fiance, Michael Quinn, on the one-off package holiday, which included exclusive access to an after 
party where platinum-selling artists Mars and the Kings Of
 Leon performed.

Lucky winners: Sarah Gilbertson and her fiance Michael Quinn were 'huge fans' of Brad Pitt - and jazz

Sarah, a rehabilitation programme coordinator for people with brain injuries, described the Hollywood superstar as 'quite genuine'.

'He took the time to speak to me and my fiancé - he'd read up on us and said congratulations and good luck with the wedding,' she said.

Then he asked me, 'do you support Liverpool?' and said, 'unlucky on not winning the league this year - maybe next year'!

'Brad was wearing a dark suit 
and he looked gorgeous.

'He's very handsome in real life. Very charming; I
 got a kiss from him - it was one of those moments, I'm not washing my 
face!'

Sarah described how she reacted when she found that she'd won the competition.

'I
 got the call when I was in Tesco doing my weekly shop and when I found 
out I just had to sit on the floor and calm myself down!' she said.

'I then told my 
manager immediately to make sure I could get the time off work.'

Pitt founded the organisation Make
 It Right in 2007, and it has so far built 100 homes of the 150 that 
organizers hope to erect for Ninth Ward residents and other people in 
need.

Tickets for the gala sold out months in advance.

'We went into the after party where Bruno Mars was playing. That was really surreal; I've never seen him before and he's such a showman. At one point Brad Pitt got on stage with him and started playing the tambourine.

'It was great watching them doing this weird duet thing on stage.

Groupon CEO Eric Lefkofsky said: ‘We've been helping to build and support communities around our thousands of local merchants since our inception.

‘By partnering with Make It Right we're able to expose millions of people around the world to this important project.

‘We want to help the organisation make a
 significant difference, one that should be replicated in struggling 
neighbourhoods across the world.

The three-night trip included first class air travel from the UK to Louis Armstrong 
International Airport in New Orleans.

The couple stayed in suites in the W Hotel, close to the renowned French Quarter in the city.

The sparkling event raised thousands of dollars to build
 homes for people in need, including victims of Hurricane Katrina in New
 Orleans, disabled veterans in New Jersey, children leaving foster care 
in Kansas City, and Native Americans on the Fort Peck Reservation in 
Montana.

Thousands of homes were left devastated by Hurricane Katrina, which struck New Orleans in August 2005.

More
 than 1,800 people lost their lives and 250,000 homes were destroyed - and two years later Make It Right started up to build affordable, high-quality housing
 in the city.
