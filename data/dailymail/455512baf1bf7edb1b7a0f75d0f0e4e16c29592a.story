A British man on a skiing holiday in the French Alps froze to death in a mountain stream following a drinking session and lay undiscovered for a day-and-a-half, it emerged tonight.

The body of Louis Roberton, 26 and from Glasgow, was found just before 8am this morning in the Lovatiere area of La Plagne.

He had gone missing late on Wednesday night during a 'bar hopping' session with two friends he was on holiday.

The party had arrived in the popular resort last Sunday, and were due to spend the week skiing and snowboarding.

But witnesses said they had seen Mr 
Robertson drinking heavily, and he is believed to have got lost as he 
tried to find a short cut home in the dark.

'It appears to have been an 
unfortunate accident,' said a local police spokesman. 'He wanted to take
a short cut and, in the cold and dark, met his death.'

The officer said that 'cold and too 
much alcohol' probably contributed to Mr Robertson getting lost, and 
ending up in the stream.

A missing persons alert was issued 
throughout the resort on Thursday at 4pm, but heavy snow and bad light 
meant the search had to be postponed overnight.

British skiers and snowboarders have frequently got into serious problems after drinking too much in the Alps.

Many have died because they underestimated the risk of drinking at a high altitude.

A campaign about the dangers involved 
was launched by the then British ambassador to France in 2009, with Sir 
Peter Westmacott saying: 'Over the past years, we've noticed a rise in 
accidents in resorts linked to alcohol consumption, particularly 
accidents on the slopes, mostly among young people.

'We are telling our compatriots to be 
careful: when you consume too much alcohol at an altitude and it's cold,
the danger is greater,' he said.

In February of this year an inquest 
heard how a young British skier died when he smashed into a snow cannon 
after drinking four bottles of beer before taking to the slopes in the 
nearby resort of Val D'Isere.

The holiday rep had also led tourists 
on a bar crawl the previous night, shouted 'Watch this!' as he set on a 
steep run moments before the tragedy.

He lost control while trying to execute a turn and ploughed into the snow-making machine at high speed.

And in January a British teenager 
drowned in an outdoor swimming pool after a night out with friends in 
Alpe d'Huez, another French ski resort.

Police said she and a male friend had 
been drinking before they climbed over a 6ft fence to get into the 
water, where she became trapped under a tarpaulin that was partly 
covering the municipal pool.

La Plagne, which was created in 1961 in the Alpine Tarentaise valley, is now made up of 11 resorts.

Its highest altitude is 10,660ft and it has a ski area of 39 square miles spread across four villages.
