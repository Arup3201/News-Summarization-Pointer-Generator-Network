Christopher Jefferies: The former teacher, pictured arriving at the inquiry today, felt he was subjected to 'house arrest' because of the media

The retired teacher wrongly arrested for killing Joanna Yeates today told the Leveson Inquiry that he was told to change his appearance to avoid media interest.

Despite being absolved of any wrongdoing, Christopher Jefferies said he was 'effectively under house arrest' during a Press 'witch hunt'.

He eventually brought legal proceedings against eight newspapers, and told the inquiry into media standards today that he felt the Press Complaints Commission was 'wholly inadequate' in controlling the excesses of the Press.

Singer Charlotte Church also appeared at the inquiry today, and said she had waived a £100,000 fee to perform at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers.

Mr Jefferies, who was the landlord of architect Joanna, was arrested on December 30 last year, five days after she was found dead. He was released two days later, and on March 4 police confirmed he was no longer a suspect.

Joanna's neighbour Vincent Tabak was found guilty of her murder last month, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

This morning Mr Jefferies told the Leveson Inquiry: 'Because the media interest was so enormous I was very strongly advised both by friends and lawyers not to go out.

'And in any case, if it had been apparent where I was staying, these friends would have been besieged by reporters and photographers.

'For a period after I was released I was effectively under house arrest and went from friends to friends - rather as if I were a recusant priest at the time of the Reformation I suppose, going from safe house to safe house.'

Mr Jefferies said that after his release from custody it was suggested it would be good for his 'psychological health' if he did not read the press coverage in detail, and he had only started doing so after libel action was started against several publications.

He told the inquiry that he brought legal proceedings against eight newspapers concerning 40 different articles. The Attorney General brought contempt of court proceedings in relation to three articles.

The former English teacher, who taught at Clifton College in Bristol, said in his witness statement: 'I can see now that, following my arrest, the national media shamelessly vilified me.

'The Press set about what can only be described as a witch hunt.'

Joanna Yeates: Mr Jefferies was wrongly accused of involvement with his tenant's death

Mr Jefferies said that having his photograph on the front page of a number of papers had made him 'instantly recognisable'.

'I had a distinctive appearance and it was as a result of the entire world knowing what I look like that it was suggested to me that I ought to change my appearance so that I would not be instantly recognisable and potentially harassed by the media,' he said.

Robert Jay QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked Mr Jefferies about when he was referred to as a 'sexually perverted voyeur'.

He replied: 'It was suggested there may have been some sort of sexual motive to the murder of Jo Yeates and at that time I was obviously a suspect of that murder.

'On the other hand it was suggested in some articles that I was gay, so that created a problem as far as that was concerned.

'It was then suggested in another article that I was bisexual - so the press were trying to have it every possible way.'

Around the time of his arrest, a number of defamatory articles appeared in the press, Mr Jefferies added.

Headlines included 'The Strange Mr Jefferies', 'Jo Suspect Peeping Tom', 'Jo Suspect Scared Kids' and 'Was Killer Waiting in Jo's Flat?'

The inquiry heard that the retired teacher was contacted by the PCC about what could be done to prevent a recurrence of what had happened to him.

Reading from his reply, he said any redress the PCC may have given would have been 'wholly inadequate'.

'It is no wonder that the PCC is held in such low esteem,' he wrote to the body.

'Indeed, I would suggest that the shocking and reckless irresponsibility displayed by sections of the media is in part attributable to the failure of the current regulatory system and the weakness of the voluntary code of practice.'

Mr Jefferies insisted that what had happened to him would continue to have an impact on his life.

'I suppose it is true to say there will always be people who don't know me, people who don't know anybody that I know, who will retain the impression that I am some sort of very weird character indeed who is probably best avoided,' he said.

'I will never fully recover from the events of last year. The incalculable effect of what was written about me by these highly influential tabloid newspapers is something from which it will be difficult ever to escape.'

Charlotte Church: The singer waived a £100,000 fee in exchange for good publicity from Rupert Murdoch's newspapers

Witness: Ms Church leaving the inquiry with her legal team this afternoon

During her appearance this afternoon, Charlotte Church told the Leveson Inquiry she was asked to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999.

In a statement she said she was offered a fee of £100,000, but was told if she waived it she 'would be looked upon favourably by Mr Murdoch's papers'.

The inquiry heard News International denied the offer was made but Ms Church today said: 'I remember being told that Rupert Murdoch had asked me to sing at his wedding to Wendi Deng and it would take place on his yacht in New York.

'I remember being told that the offer of money or the offer of the favour, in order to basically get good press, to be looked upon favourably.

'And I also remember being 13 and thinking, "Why on earth would anybody take a favour over £100,000?"'

She said she and her mother were both quite 'resolute' about accepting the money, but were urged by her management and figures from the record company into taking the option of the favour from a 'powerful man' like Mr Murdoch.

The inquiry heard it was later claimed her performance was organised as a surprise for Mr Murdoch, but Ms Church said she understood the request to be specifically from him: 'I had been told by my management that he had specifically asked for me to sing Pie Jesu.'

She said she had raised the issue that it was a requiem - a funeral song - but was told Mr Murdoch specifically wanted it performed.

In her witness statement, she said that accepting the waiver 'failed', adding: 'In fact Mr Murdoch's newspapers have since been some of the worst offenders, so much that I have sometimes felt that there has actually been a deliberate agenda.

'While newspapers such as Mr Murdoch's have not helped my career, they certainly damaged it.

'I do of course accept television and radio have been very significant contributors to my success. I have little complaint at the contact of those media organisations or the people they employ.'

Ms Church also described a 'shadow network' of staff at hotels, restaurants and airlines who tip off journalists about her movements.
