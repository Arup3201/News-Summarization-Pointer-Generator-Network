Spy chiefs have been told by MPs to recruit middle-aged mothers because they are 'emotionally intelligent' and skilled at relationships.

The Intelligence and Security Committee said MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should start advertising on the Mumsnet website.

An inquiry by the MPs and peers on the committee found that action was needed to break through the 'permafrost' of middle-aged men dominating the ranks of the intelligence agencies who have a 'very traditional male mentality and outlook'.

Across the three agencies, women make up 37 per cent of the workforce but hold only 19 per cent of the most senior roles.

Labour's Hazel Blears, who sits on the ISC, said yesterday that recruiting a greater number of women would make the security services better at their job.

She highlighted the particular skills mothers have in building relationships – a vital talent for spies trying to recruit informants.

'Women who have had children and brought their families up, they have valuable life experience,' the former Home Office minister said.

The dominance of men, by contrast, 'can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career', she said. 

Women deliver a 'more consultative, collaborative approach'.

Mrs Blears said: 'If all intelligence professionals are cut from the same cloth – sharing similar backgrounds and characteristics – then they are likely to share 'unacknowledged biases' that will circumscribe both the definition of problems and the search for solutions.'

According to the inquiry, her view that women can make for a better working environment for spies was backed by Sir Iain Lobban, the former director of GCHQ, the listening agency. 

'I find that the discussions are deeper, I think they are more emotionally intelligent and, if you like, I think there is more intuition in the room,' he said.

Mrs Blears said the need for MI6 officers to be able to deploy abroad – sometimes at short notice – could be a problem for women with children. 

She added: 'There is a bit of testosterone in the system that says, 'Tickets, money, passport – we all have to get there'. And if you've got children, finding 24-hour childcare is often very difficult.'

Mrs Blears also revealed that the BBC TV drama Spooks had made it harder for MI5 to recruit women

A string of its female characters met a grisly end, such as being blown apart trying to rescue a Home Secretary from a bomb.

In a report out today the ISC will call for a number of reforms to be introduced within the next 12 months across the agencies, including culture change, help for women who have had children to stop them being sidelined and career advice.

Targeted recruitment should also be carried out, including through websites such as Mumsnet, it recommends.

Ms Blears said: 'Changing the culture is the one area that is most difficult to articulate and, crucially, to take action on, but if you want change, that is where to start.

I’d make a great spy. I go totally unnoticed everywhere I go, but I have a keen eye for detail. Nobody suspects a woman in mum boots of anything underhand.

If they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog-haired jumper and not noticing, I’m their woman.

I’ve always said that a crack team of Mothers could knock most governments into a cocked hat.

I would LOVE to be a spy. And no one would suspect me. I am too boring and frumpy.

Well I’m not signing up. I’ve watched Spooks. Everybody I get attached to dies a horrible death.

'It is clear to us there are those at middle management level - referred to by some people as 'the permafrost' - who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook.

'This can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative, collaborative approach.

'We therefore recommend that there is a real focus on identifying and tackling the barriers that can exist at middle management level, so that women and men can fully achieve their potential in a supportive team ethos.'

The Committee hopes that this report and the specific recommendations it contains will galvanise support for, and lead to further concerted efforts to create, a more gender diverse workforce in the agencies.'

Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who conducted a similar investigation into women in the CIA, said improving diversity would help in the response to threats to national security.

She said: 'As Ms Blears rightly says diversity should be pursued - not just on legal or ethical grounds, important as these are in their own right - but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security.

'Much of what is said in this report echoes and reinforces my own work on the director's advisory group on women in Intelligence at the CIA. 

'I am sure we will all benefit from close cooperation on these vital issues between our two countries.'
