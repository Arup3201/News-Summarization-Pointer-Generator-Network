As the death toll from Ebola reaches 3,800, experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne, meaning that it could be caught by breathing it in.

The public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids – blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen – of an infected person who is showing symptoms.

However, several leading Ebola researchers claim that the virus mutating and spreading through the air should not be ruled out.

As the death toll from Ebola reaches 3,800, experts are warning that the virus could mutate and become airborne

Virus expert Charles L. Bailey, who in 1989 helped the American government tackle an outbreak of Ebola among rhesus monkeys being used for research, told the LA Times: 'We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting.

'Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are "misleading".'

Dr C J Peters, who has undertaken research into Ebola for America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the paper: 'We just don't have the data to exclude it [becoming airborne].'

Meanwhile virologist Dr Philip K Russell, a former head of the U.S Army's Medical Research and Development Command, told the paper: 'I see the reasons to dampen down public fears. But scientifically, we're in the middle of the first experiment of multiple, serial passages of Ebola virus in man.... God knows what this virus is going to look like. I don't.'

In September, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, writing in the New York Times, said experts who believe that Ebola could become airborne are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria.

Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.'

Dr Osterholm warns viruses similar to Ebola are notorious for replicating and reinventing themselves.

It means the virus that first broke out in Guinea in February may be very different to the one now invading other parts of West Africa.

Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' 

Dr Osterholm said public health officials, while discussing the possibility in private, are reluctant to air their concerns.

Virus expert Charles L. Bailey said unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are 'misleading'

'They don't want to be accused of screaming "Fire!" in a crowded theater - as I'm sure some will accuse me of doing.

'But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.'

He called for the United Nations to mobilise medical, public health and humanitarian aid to 'smother the epidemic'. 

The chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate.

He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time. 

He told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus.'

The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. died on Wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment, and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease. 

The checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from West Africa at five major American airports. 

The new screenings will begin Saturday at New York's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Newark. An estimated 150 people per day will be checked, using high-tech thermometers that don't touch the skin. 

The White House said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the three heaviest-hit countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. 

President Barack Obama called the measures 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place. Border Patrol agents now look for people who are obviously ill, as do flight crews, and in those cases the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is notified.

As of Wednesday, Ebola has killed about 3,800 people in West Africa and infected at least 8,000, according to the World Health Organization. 

A medical official with the U.N. Mission in Liberia who tested positive for Ebola arrived in the German city of Leipzig on Thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities, authorities said.

The unidentified medic infected in Liberia is the second member of the U.N. mission, known as UNMIL, to contract the virus. The first died on September 25. He is the third Ebola patient to arrive in Germany for treatment.

The virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers, sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - places that already were short on doctors and nurses. 

There are no approved medications for Ebola, so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases, including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from Ebola.

The survivor's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus.
