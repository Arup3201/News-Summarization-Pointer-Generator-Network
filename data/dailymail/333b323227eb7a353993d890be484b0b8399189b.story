Dubai International announced it is set to clock up more than 71 million passengers by the end of the year and could overtake the current busiest airport in the world - Heathrow.

Passenger traffic at Dubai International rose 5.7 per cent in October putting the airport on track to eclipse the 71 million passenger mark according to the latest traffic report issued by operator Dubai Airports.

Passenger traffic in October totalled 5,989,007 compared to 5,667,698 recorded in the corresponding month last year, an increase of 5.7 per cent. Year to date traffic rose 6.1 per cent to 58,411,554 compared to 55,046,863 recorded during the same period in 2013.

Passenger numbers for Dubai International Airport are projected to reach 78.4 million in 2015

'We are on track to exceed 71 million passengers by year-end which is a remarkable number when you consider we lost the services of one or our runways for almost three months,' said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. 

'We are neck-and-neck with London Heathrow in our race for the number one position coming down the home stretch. It is sure to be a photo finish.' 

Dubai Airports estimate passenger numbers are projected to reach 78.4 million in 2015 and 103.5 million by 2020. 

The Indian subcontinent was the top market in terms of growth in overall passenger numbers (+121,669 passengers) closely followed by Western Europe (113,032 passengers), Asia (+73,675) and Africa (31,405). 

Dubai International estimate that they will eclipse 71 million passengers by the end of 2014

In terms of percentage growth Eastern Europe (+22 per cent) was the strongest market followed by Asia (15.4 per cent) while declines were recorded in Russia & CIS (-8.2 per cent), AGGC (-3.7 per cent) and Middle East (-3.2 per cent).

Around 72.3 million passengers travelled through Heathrow last year, with 191,200 passengers arriving or departing every single day.

A recent study has shown that aviation will account for more than a third of Dubai's economy by 2020, as the Gulf emirate has become a major international travel hub.

Oil-poor Dubai has spent years trying to diversify its economy with core sectors now including trade, transport and tourism.

Aviation contributed 27 percent - or $26.7 billion (21.4 billion euros) - to Dubai's gross domestic product in 2013, Oxford Economics said in a report for Emirates Airline and Dubai Airports.

Heathrow Airport remains the world's busiest, but is Dubai International set to take the crown?

The report said the sector would grow to contribute £33.9 billion ($53.1 billion) -- equivalent to 37.5 per cent of GDP -- by 2020.

'Between now and 2020 the contribution of the aviation sector to Dubai's economy is expected to grow at a faster rate than the economy as a whole,' the global research firm said.

An increase in passenger numbers and expansion of Dubai's existing airport capacity will help to drive this growth, the report said.

Dubai International Airport is the busiest airport in the Middle East. It served 66.4 million passengers in 2013, and is expected to host more than 100 million in 2020.

Also ranked among the world's busiest airports, Dubai International has established itself as a major hub linking the West with Asia and Australasia.

The emirate opened its second passenger airport in October 2013. When complete, Al-Maktoum International will handle 120 million passengers annually.

Government-owned Emirates Airline, which is based at Dubai International, carried 44.5 million passengers in 2013, compared with 39.4 million the previous year.

The airline operates the world's largest fleets of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s, and flies to 146 destinations in 83 countries.
