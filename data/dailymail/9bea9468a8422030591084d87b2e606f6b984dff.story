The company behind a banned advert for a payday lender featuring troubled star Kerry Katona has re-launched its campaign featuring the formerly bankrupt singer again.

The promotion for Cash Lady was banned by the Advertising Standards Agency because it appeared to suggest that it was possible to afford a popstar's lifestyle by using the lender's services.

But after a gap of just four days, Ms Katona is once more appearing on TV in a similar but slightly different version of the Cash Lady ad, using the same colour scheme and graphic designs.

Campaigners have criticised payday lenders for using 'glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements' to glamourise their loans, which tend to come with very high interest rates.

Ms Katona, 32, who first rose to fame as a member of the recently reunited Atomic Kitten, has run into well-documented personal and financial troubles, and was declared bankrupt in 2008.

The Cash Lady television ads played on the star's notoriety, and featured her saying: 'We've all had money troubles at some point, I know I have.

'You could see your bank and fill in loads of forms, but is there an easier way to get a loan.'

The company, which is registered under the name PDB UK Ltd, offers loans of up to £300 a month with an annual percentage rate of 2,760 per cent.

It tends to charge £29 interest per month for every £100 borrowed.

Glitzy: The firm was censured for making payday loans appear glamorous by using the star's image

Payday loans are designed to provide short-term assistance to people who need cash in an emergency, and should not be used as a routine source of income due to their high interest rates.

After 29 people complained about the advert, the ASA ruled that it was 'irresponsible' and potentially misleading.

The agency said that the ad made 'no reference to the fact that these loans were intended for short-term stop gaps between pay day and were not intended as a more immediate solution for more serious financial problems'.

It also 'had the potential to encourage vulnerable viewers with financial problems and/or restricted credit from seeking to resolve them through the payday loan service', according to the ASA.

The agency also criticised Cash Lady for not displaying the sky-high APR prominently enough, and for using Ms Katona's personal history to attract customers who are struggling financially.

Gillian Guy, chief executive of 
Citizens Advice, said that advertising like that produced by Cash Lady 
was misleading and potentially exploitative.

'Glossy adverts and slick celebrity endorsements cover up the harsh reality of life in debt,' she said. 'Behind the glamorous marketing lie extortionate interest rates and charges and the misery of multiple rollover loans.

'Payday loans firms need to do much 
more to make sure that they treat their customers fairly. New evidence 
from Citizens Advice found 65 per cent of lenders do not check if 
borrowers can afford to pay back the loan and many don't offer to freeze
interest or charges if people are struggling to keep up repayments.

'It's time that high-cost lenders face up to their responsibilities and tell their customers the truth.'

The new ad is entirely legal because 
it has been tweaked slightly to make it different to the banned version.
It could, however, be banned in the future if viewers complain to the 
ASA and the complaints are upheld.

Troubled: The singer was filmed talking incoherently and slurring her words on This Morning in 2008

The company today defended its use of Ms Katona and insisted it had complied with the ASA's instructions.

'The version of the advert which is currently being aired does not refer to Kerry's financial history or compare payday loan applications to high street bank loans, which were the issues that the ASA criticised,' a spokesman said.

'The ASA did not have issue with Kerry being part of the campaign - it was what was said in that specific advert. We are looking forward to continuing working with Kerry, and we are planning on filming an all-new advert soon.

'We strive to be as compliant as possible and be a responsible part of the payday loans industry.'

The case is similar to a number of controversies involving budget airline Ryanair, which has repeatedly had its adverts banned only to release similarly controversial publicity materials only days later.

'It is not our role to ban entire sectors, including payday loans, from advertising or to outlaw the use of celebrities in ads,' the agency told the Independent.

Ms Katona joined Atomic Kitten, whose hits included Whole Again and Eternal Flame, at the age of just 18, but left the band after becoming pregnant by Westlife star Brian McFadden.

The mother of four appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! among a number of reality TV shows, and is also known for her works in adverts for Iceland.

In 2008, she was declared bankrupt after failing to pay her taxes properly, and the next year was dropped by some of her employers when pictures were published which allegedly showed her taking cocaine.
