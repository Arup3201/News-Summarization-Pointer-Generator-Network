Friends of Kobi Pickett have spoken of their shock that their close friend could die in such tragic and unfortunate circumstances.

'She was so smart, she was ahead in all of her classes. She would even ask us to tutor her to get ahead in her classes,' said close friend, Amana Waheed.

So popular: The Girl Scout was loved by her friends who spoke of their devastation that she had died so needlessly 

Her devastated parents, Don and Stephanie posted her obituary online on Monday night and revealed their devastation at their loss.

'On Sunday night, Janyary 11, 2015, our beautiful, innocent baby girl was taken from us through a horrific accident,' wrote Kobi's parents.

'She loved swimming and snorkeling at Barton Springs, tumbling, walks with our dog Murphy, track, soccer, water skiing, photography, baking sweets, decorating birthday cakes, face-time with friends, babysitting, and all the kids in the neighborhood.

'Kobi loved her Nana and visited regularly. She loved all her family, especially the cousins, and spending 'family time' on the couch.

Massive outbreak: This map from the CDC shows that flu activity is high and at epidemic levels in 21 states

The Girl Scout 'loved giving hugs' to her father and mother and 'worshiped' her older brother Dawson, her parents said.

Kobi's neighbors decided to show their respect to the teen by tying blue ribbons on all the trees around her family home.

'Whenever I would say bad words, she would say 'Amanda that's not right', she would correct me, she was a little mom. She had so many dreams and honestly, she could've done all of them,' said friend Amanda Waheed to KHOU.

This has been a particularly bad year for flu across the United States.

Flu is widespread in 46 U.S. states, up from 36 states in the prior week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week.

Six children died from the flu during the last full week in December, bringing the total flu deaths to 26 this season, the report showed.

As of the beginning of the new year, the CDC reported for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 percent of all deaths. That figure slipped slightly below the epidemic level in this week's report, the CDC said.

Flu is widespread in 46 U.S. states, up from 36 states in the prior week, according to the CDC.

To date, 26 children have died from the flu this season and more than 1,000 across the country have succumbed to the mutated form of the H3 virus.

At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 percent of all deaths.

And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia.

CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and very young children. What's more, officials think the flu vaccine doesn't work well against this particular virus. So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference Friday.

National epidemic: The flu has been reported as widespread in 46 states across the country this season

CDC officials said flu was reported to be widespread in 46 states last week, up from 43 the week before. But there was a small drop in states reporting high numbers of flu-related doctor's office visits. That's one sign that for some areas, the worst stretch of the current flu season may be ending.

Flu seasons tend to last about 13 weeks, and CDC data suggests the nation is about seven weeks in, Frieden said. 'It seems we're right in the middle of flu season,' he said.

However, while flu may be ebbing in some states, it's increasing in others, and it's not clear whether flu has peaked overall, health officials said.

CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. CDC officials say the number should be higher.

When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - they can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found. The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said.

'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' he said.

The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals. CDC officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick from the flu, or someone with pre-existing conditions like asthma, diabetes and heart disease.

'Last week was the first week that this particular number exceeded the epidemic threshold, but we've been in a flu epidemic for weeks now,' said Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Influenza Division.

The epidemic has become so bad that antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu have been used and doctors are being urged to prescribe the drug to patients with flu-like symptoms even before tests confirm influenza as the cause.

The United States is midway through the 2015 flu season and the CDC's Dr. Thomas Frieden said that some doctors in the United States may not be prescribing Tamiflu because they believe the drugs do not work.

Victims: Ayzlee McCarthy, 3,  and Jose Gullapa, 6, all passed away within 72 hours of contracting the flu last month

Victims: New Jersey mother, Nicole Born, (left) and Wisconsin radiology technician Katy McQuestion (right) died from complications arising from the flu in the New Year

Children are among those hardest hit by the flu this year and their health has been compromised by the virulent mutant form of flu that has struck.

Shannon Zwanziger, 17, died on December 9 after being struck down with this years mutated H3N2 strain, despite having no underlying health conditions.

And experts said the crisis is only going to worsen, with January and February the worst months for flu nationwide.

The problem worrying the authorities is the particular strain of flu.

This year's dominant strain is the H3N2, which was not targeted by vaccinations this year.

It affects children and those over 65 particularly, such as Ayzlee McCarthy, who died three days after developing symptoms at home in Des Moines, Iowa.

Ayzlee had no underlying health conditions and was buried on New Year's Day.

Another child who died just days after developing symptoms was Jose Gullapa, 6, who passed away in his father's arms on December 20.

He had fallen ill just two days before, but was suffering from asthma.

Vaccinated: McQuestion, 26, had been inoculated against the flu before she passed away in January but this years strain is proving resilient 

Another tragic case of a flu fatality is that of New Jersey mother, Nicole Born, 40, who died after complications from the mutated virus.

Nicole has left a seven-year-old and a three-year-old behind and was overcome by the flu within the space of one week.

Her family revealed that Nicole was not vaccinated before getting sick and as a result, they have all had the jab.

Meanwhile, all the way across the country in Wisconsin, 26-year-old Katy McQuestion passed away from the flu after developing sepsis that caused her to have a heart attack.

McQuestion had been suffering from flu-like symptoms for three days and had been coughing and vomiting.

Her condition suddenly worsened despite her not having a fever and her family said that even though she had got the vaccine it did not seem to have been sufficient.
