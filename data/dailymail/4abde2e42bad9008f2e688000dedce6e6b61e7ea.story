Luis Suarez is clearly enjoying himself  at Barcelona as he settles into life at the Catalan giants since his big-money move from Liverpool this summer.

The 27-year-old, who made his debut for the club as a late substitute in a  6-0 friendly win over Mexican side Club Leon on Monday, looked in buoyant mood as he trained with his team-mates ahead of their La Liga opener at home to Elche on Sunday night.

Suarez is expected to make his competitive debut for his new side in a mouthwatering clash against arch-rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico on October 26 following the completion of his four-month domestic ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Elsewhere, Luis Enrique will be looking to kick off his reign at Barcelona with the best possible result in his first game as manager following a busy summer of transfer activity at the Nou Camp.

The likes of Suarez and Thomas Vermaelen have signed long-term deals with the club as they now await a two-year wait before they can sign anyone else after their appeal for their transfer ban was rejected by FIFA.

Luckily Enrique has a squad of top class players at his disposal as they look to win their second La Liga title in three years this season.
