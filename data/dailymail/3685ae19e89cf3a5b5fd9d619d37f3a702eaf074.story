Everton’s record signing Romelu Lukaku can expect a rapturous welcome from supporters when he is presented at Goodison Park today ahead of team-mate Leon Osman’s testimonial against Porto.

Lukaku, who completed a £28million move from Chelsea last week after a successful loan spell at Everton last season, will be joined on the pitch before kick-off by American World Cup hero Tim Howard, who has returned to Merseyside early to support Osman’s big day.

Belgian striker Lukaku, 21, scored 16 goals for Everton last season and his return to Goodison Park on a permanent basis is a real mission statement by manager Roberto Martinez, who is looking for him to form a lethal partnership with rising England star Ross Barkley.

Signal of intent: Roberto Martinez's Everton signed Romelu Lukaku for £28m from Chelsea

Ovations: Lukaku will be presented at Goodison Park on Sunday along with USA World Cup hero Tim Howard

Lukaku decided to leave Stamford Bridge after Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told him he would not be guaranteed first-team football following the £32m arrival of striker Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid this summer.

The added presence today of goalkeeper Howard, who was given an extended break by Martinez following his exploits in Brazil over the summer, where he made a record 16 saves during defeat by Belgium in the last 16 of the World Cup, underlines the popularity of 33-year-old Osman, who made his Everton debut in 2003 and is one of the Premier League’s longest-serving one-club men.

Proceeds from today’s 4pm kick-off will go to a number of charities, including the renowned Claire House Childrens’ Hospice which is located on the Wirral across the River Mersey from Liverpool.
