Australia's stunning harbour city of Sydney has been ranked the world's most liveable in a new study.

Sydney was a surprise entrant into the top 10 as it took out the top spot in an annual study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which compares 30 global cities on social and economic factors.

The NSW capital was also ranked first for its natural environment and sustainability, second for health safety and security, though slipped to the very bottom rung for cost of living.

The best city overall on all categories was London for the first time, with Sydney coming in ninth. Factors such as transport and infrastructure could be to blame for pulling Sydney down, the report said.

In terms of availability and cost of housing and maintenance Sydney snapped up the top rank and performed well on measures comparing environments and livability such as healthcare, crime rates, pollution, and climate. Â

Speaking to Sydney's high quality-of-life, the report said: '(Sydney's) good quality of life has a powerful pull, perhaps made even more seductive by beautiful beaches and sophisticated culture.'

No other Australian capital cities made an appearance in the list.

London was also up two notices in the category of economic power, with Paris falling by two.

New York was ranked as the world's second most attractive city and Singapore came in third, followed by Toronto and San Francisco.

Paris came in first in terms of 'intellectual capital and innovation'.

Australia's most populated city did out rank overall winner London when it came to demographics and liveability. Sydney came in first by a small margin in the quality-of-life section which rounds up the survey.

Cities are ranked for cost, demographics, ease of doing business, health and safety, economic clout, as well as transport based on research from World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as well as a survey of PricewaterhouseCoopers staff.
