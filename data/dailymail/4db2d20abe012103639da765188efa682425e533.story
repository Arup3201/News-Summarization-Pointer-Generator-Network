Alex Hales will be dropped by England for the must-win fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka as Alastair Cook returns as captain  following his one-match over-rate ban.

With James Taylor a shoo-in after his sparkling 90 at in Colombo two days ago, England will omit Hales, whose two games so far have produced 27, 0 and a dropped catch – to say nothing of his part in the run-out of Moeen Ali in Hambantota.

Another option would have been to rest Joe Root for the match in the picturesque hill-country of Pallekele  – so allowing him extra time to practise the ukulele he now carries around with him on tour.

But, unlike Hales, Root is regarded as a certainty for the starting XI at the World Cup, and will be given as much match practice as possible here.

Among the bowlers, the disappointing Ben Stokes will be fortunate to squeeze out off-spinner James Tredwell for a third successive match.

If Tredwell’s omission in Colombo over the weekend suggested England had got into a muddle over their priorities, then they have no option here. 

It’s win or bust as England have to take three victories from the final three matches to clinch an improbable 4-3 triumph.

Root, who played a vital part in England’s lone win in Hambantota last week but has otherwise failed to build on a couple of promising starts, had no hesitation in toeing the party line.

‘There’s no reason why we can’t,’ he said. ‘I think we showed in every game at some point that we’re capable of doing that. 

'Now we have to put it into one complete performance. Even the game we did win we weren’t at our best, which is promising.

‘But we don’t want to talk about being promising all the time. Now is the time for us to step up and start putting in performances. 

'This is a great opportunity for us to do it under pressure before a World Cup.’

The tour has taken an unexpected twist with the news that Sachithra Senanayake, the off-spinner who was banned for chucking in July, could make a dramatic return in Wednesday’s fifth one-day international.

Senanayake – who also caused a stir in the summer with the Mankadding of Jos Buttler – has been cleared by the ICC to resume his career after reportedly removing the kink in his action.

The spinner had originally been pencilled in to make his return during Saturday’s sixth match here, but a hamstring injury to left-arm spinner Rangana Herath at Tuesday’s practice session could speed up his inclusion.

For a bowler whose basic off-break was being delivered with 40 degrees of elbow flex – 25 more than the legal limit – it is quite a comeback.

‘He’s a tough character,’ said Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu. ‘He’ll be the same bowler, but maybe with a slightly different action. He’s been working hard on his action and was very keen to get back to international cricket as soon as he could.’

Asked about the incident with Buttler, who was run out by Senanayake backing up too far at the non-striker’s end during the one-day international at Edgbaston, Atapattu rightly refused to budge an inch: ‘The rules say he did nothing wrong, and I totally stick by that.’ 

New Zealand No 3 and part-time off-spinner Kane Williamson has also had his action cleared, but it is the transformation of Senanayake, from a bowler whose obvious kink so infuriated England to persona grata, that is sure to lend spice to the last two games here.

While England were convinced during the summer of the illegality of his action – as well as outraged by the manner of Buttler’s dismissal in Birmingham – the Sri Lankans exploited the reporting of Senanayake to foster a them-and-us mentality that eventually helped them win their first Test series in England.

On Tuesday, Root spoke diplomatically about the bowler's potential return. ‘That would be great,’ he said.

‘He’s a very good international player. If he comes back we’ll just have to find a way of combatting him.’
