A couple from Florida who believed they met each other at university found that their paths crossed years earlier when they were both children at pre-school.

Jason and Jessica Roth, 35, from Miami thought a nightclub near Florida State University was the place they should note as the place where true love struck, but they actually met each other 17 years earlier at a costume party.

Jason, in a Superman outfit, together with his future wife, Jessica, in a pink and burgundy genie costume, were pictured together at their preschool Halloween parade.

Familiar face? Jason and Jessica Roth are coming up on their 10 year anniversary, but an old photo revealed that they actually met much, much earlier - in preschool

Save the date: Wedding bells could have been in the air as long as 17 years before they finally got together...

They were shocked when they discovered that, though they're from different towns, they had a picture together from 17 years before they 'met'

The couple only found out about their previous encounter 18 months into their relationship.

They always knew that they had attended the same preschool for a brief period of time when Jason lived in the town of Lakeland with his aunt.

However, they did not realize that they ended up participating in the same events as one another.

The pair have no memory of each other as kids but after finding an old photo taken at his preschool's Halloween parade, Jason spotted a little girl dressed in pink.

'I vaguely remembered having a photo 
from that period of time,' Jason said. He rummaged through old photos, 
and came across a single photo from Halloween during his time in 
Lakeland.

He spotted a little blonde girl that looked a whole lot like 
his then-girlfriend.

'I was sitting at work and he called me and 
said, ‘Hey, I found this picture. When you were in preschool, what was 
your Halloween costume?'

The 35-year-olds met at a club near Florida State University, their alma mater, and started dating when Jason was a senior at FSU, but they actually 'met' when they were both much younger

She said she was a genie, which matched the girl in the photo. 'I sat there looking at the wall thinking ‘This is incredible.’'

'Never did I think she’d be the girl standing two feet from me,' Jason added. He’s hesitant to call it 'destiny,' but rather 'pretty phenomenal happenstance.'

'We were always kind of in each other’s orbits, we were just waiting for the stars to align.' Jason said. 'Very rarely in life do you see how all pieces fall into places to make things happen.'

'It was a pretty amazing revelation that despite me spending a majority of my childhood in Miami, we managed to go to preschool together,' Jason told The Huffington Post.

The couple also found out that they lived in the same dorm freshman at Florida State University and that he even server her beignets at the cafe he used to work in.

About a year after discovering the picture, the couple got engaged. They even used the incredible flashback photo as their 'Save the Date' wedding announcement.

The couple have now been together a decade and will celebrate their 10th anniversary in April.

Whether it be divine intervention or just plain good luck, Jason believes the picture is proof that they are meant to be together.

'Life is hard and sometimes our orbits get further apart, but then they come back together and I couldn't be more grateful to have such a wonderful partner in life,' he said.
