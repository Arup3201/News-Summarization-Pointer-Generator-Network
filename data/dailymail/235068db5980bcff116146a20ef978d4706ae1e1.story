The body of a shirtless man killed by Ebola is picked up from the middle of a dirt road in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, and carried away by health workers.

The shocking images, which are being taken in West Africa on a daily basis, highlight how the outbreak is spiraling out of control - and medical officials are yet to find a cure.

But experts believe an unusual treatment may help combat the disease, one which involves using the blood of those who have survived the deadly virus.

'This is something that's fairly simple to do,' said Dr. Peter Piot, director of London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus. 

More than 200 experts, assembled by the World Health Organization, have gathered in Geneva for a two day conference.

The group are looking at issues of safety and effectiveness and considering which treatments should be prioritized for testing during the current outbreak. 

There are around a half dozen medicines and vaccines in development. None has been tested on humans but an early trial of one vaccine began this week in the United States.

Much attention has focused on the unproven drug ZMapp, which was given to seven patients, two of whom died. But the limited supply is now exhausted and its developer says it will take months to make even a modest amount.

In contrast, WHO's blood network, an international group of blood regulators, noted recently there are thousands of survivors from past Ebola outbreaks in Africa who could be tapped as a source. 

The group said blood from survivors should be considered experimental and recommended that studies be done during the crisis.

In another document published this week, WHO estimated the first batches of survivor blood could be available by the end of the year. The agency said it had identified several recovered patients as potential donors, but acknowledged 'logistics of blood collection are an issue.'

Some scientists think antibodies in the blood of Ebola survivors could help patients infected with the deadly disease.

Antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to fight off harmful things like viruses. They remain in the blood ready to fight off any future infections by the same foreign substance.

Piot said it is vital to find out if the blood treatment is effective.

'I hope this is the last Ebola outbreak where all we have is isolation, quarantine and supportive care to treat patients,' he said.

Experts say blood from survivors could be collected and processed for multiple patients, or a survivor could donate blood to an individual patient. Both methods require screening the blood for diseases like HIV or malaria.

While direct donation would be easier, the levels of Ebola-fighting antibodies produced by a survivor can vary. Ideally, experts said, the amount of antibodies should be measured.

'With drugs, you can at least do some quality control,' said Tom Geisbert, an Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. 'If you're just taking blood blindly from (survivors) without testing it for antibody levels, how can we predict what outcome they will have?'

In West Africa, there have been no organized attempts to use the blood of survivors to treat patients. Blood from a 14-year-old boy who survived Ebola was given in July to American doctor Kent Brantly, who was infected in Liberia. Brantly also got some ZMapp and was released from an Atlanta hospital last month. It's unknown whether the drug or the boy's blood aided his recovery.

Blood from survivors of diseases including Ebola, bird flu and anthrax has been used in the past when doctors ran out of options and seems to work best in diseases where there's a toxin, like anthrax and tetanus.

For treating Ebola, 'you would need to come up with how much you should give, how long, and what's a safe infusion rate,' said Dr. Michael Kurilla, director of BioDefense at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. 'If you know what the potency of the serum is, you could theoretically help the body clear Ebola out of their cells before it can do too much damage.'

Dr. Colin Brown, who recently worked in Ebola clinics in Sierra Leone for King's College London's partnership with the country, said local hospitals should be able to provide survivors' blood if doctors want to offer it.

So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected. Last week, WHO estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the Ebola outbreak is stopped, a figure Brown described as unfortunate but realistic.

'It does give us the opportunity to try some new therapies,' he said. 'And as long as they are not harmful, why shouldn't we try to do something, hopefully help some patients and learn from this?'

Health officials are monitoring more than 200 people who may have been exposed to Ebola in southern Nigeria and are working to find more people at risk in a race to contain the disease's spread in Africa's most populous country.

Authorities had been cautiously optimistic that they would be able to keep Nigeria's outbreak relatively small. The sick Liberian-American who brought the disease to Nigeria by plane was quickly isolated and officials said they were successfully monitoring the people who were in contact with him.

But then last month, one of those contacts escaped surveillance and fled to the southern oil hub of Port Harcourt. He infected a doctor who, in turn, exposed dozens of people to the disease when he continued treating patients after he began having Ebola symptoms, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said.

Elsewhere in West Africa, the outbreak is spinning out of control, killing about 1,900 people so far, according to the WHO. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have each recorded hundreds of deaths and the disease most recently spread to Senegal.

In southern Nigeria, 200 people have been identified as having been exposed to the ill doctor and are being monitored, the WHO said. About 60 of those are considered at a high risk of getting Ebola.

Officials are urgently tracking down more contacts and educating residents about the disease, Dr Sampson Parker, the health commissioner for Rivers State, where Port Harcourt is located, said.

Rumour, fear and confusion about Ebola, which is more typically found in Central Africa, have helped to fuel its spread. Some people hide their symptoms or avoid medical care, seeing hospitals as places where people simply go to die.

Nigerian officials have urged people in Port Harcourt not to panic. Joseph Obari, an oil worker, said he felt the local authorities had put in place adequate measures to curtail the disease. But others worry that Ebola will spread.

'I am very afraid because of the manner the disease is spreading,' said Oji Egwuno, a hotel manager in Port Harcourt. 'I have to be cautious because I don't want to be the next victim.'

So far, more than 3,000 people have been infected and around 1,900 people are thought to have died. Last week, WHO estimated there could be another 20,000 cases before the Ebola outbreak is stopped
