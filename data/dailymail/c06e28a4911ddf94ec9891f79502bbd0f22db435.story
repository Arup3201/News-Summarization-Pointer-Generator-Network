The family of a bride who was murdered on her honeymoon says the 'battle has just begun' after a court ruled that her husband should be extradited to South Africa to face trial over the death.

Shrien Dewani, 33, is suspected of ordering the killing of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.

Lawyers acting for the honeymoon murder suspect intend to appeal against today's ruling that he should be extradited, a spokesman for his family said today.

Dewani's (pictured last month) defence team has argued that the extradition decision should be delayed for six months to avoid the accused's condition worsening

Family members of Anni Dewani arrive at Westminster Magistrates Court, today to hear that the District Judge has ruled that the 33-year-old should be extradited to South Africa

But Anni Dewani's family said they were satisfied with the decision that 
Dewani should be extradited.

They said: 'We will fight this battle to 
the end and this battle has just begun.'

Today at Westminster Magistrates’ Court 
he lost his extradition battle as Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle decided
Dewani should return to the country.

Chief Magistrate Riddle told Westminster Magistrates' Court that Dewani should return to the country, despite arguments by his defence team that he could suffer setbacks in his mental health if sent back now.

They argued that the decision should be delayed by six months.

The businessman has been receiving treatment for depression and post traumatic stress disorder at mental hospitals near Bristol since his wife’s death. 

Prosecutors claim that Dewani hired a hitman to kill his new wife, something that the accused has consistently denied

But prosecutors claim that it would not be
'oppressive' to extradite the businessman to face trial, and that there
has been a 'significant and sustained improvement' in his mental health
in recent months.

Hugo 
Keith QC, for the South African government, admitted that he is 
currently not fit to plead, but argued that this should not stop the 
extradition process.

During a
full extradition hearing earlier this month, Professor Nigel Eastman 
said that extraditing Dewani could worsen his condition.

'If he goes 
now, he will be in a poorer state than if he goes in six months’ time,' he said.

The businessman (seen right in 2011) has been receiving treatment for depression and post traumatic stress disorder at mental hospitals since the death of Anni Dewani

'If he goes to South Africa and does not improve, he is at risk of being chronically ill and chronically unfit to plead.'

It
emerged during the four-day hearing that while resident at Fromeside 
and Blaise View mental health units Dewani was allowed to walk home 
every day, and a camper van was set up in the grounds where he would 
spend long periods of time.

District Judge Riddle ruled in 2011 that Dewani should be sent back to South Africa, but this was successfully appealed against and he was ordered to look again at the case.

So far three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani’s death.

Last year South African Xolile Mngeni was
convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. 

Prosecutors claimed 
that he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his new wife, something 
that Dewani has consistently denied.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for
18 years after he admitted his part in the killing, and another 
accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was 
handed a 25-year prison sentence.

Today the courtroom was packed with Mrs 
Dewani's relatives, who wore photographs of her pinned to their clothes,
decorated with pink ribbons.

Anni's sister Ami Denborg said: 'We’re just waiting, waiting for an actual trial, we’re waiting for the truth for all our unanswered questions to be answered. 'It’s a long wait for us.'

Her brother Anish Hindocha told of the effects the past two years have had on his family: 'It's been a nightmare for our parents, they can barely sleep and we as the sister and brother are trying to be strong in front of them but it’s really difficult.'

Of her father Vinod Hindocha, she said: 'Every single time there's a hearing he stands there, watching, seeing and thinking about Anni. She is always with us.'

Ami added: 'My dad has been to every single court hearing, here in England and in South Africa. 'He’s been travelling just to find out what happened to Anni.

'My mum's really struggling with her health and it’s a stress that she can’t really handle.'

Ami added: 'I would say my father has aged. In two years he’s aged so many years. It shows on his face, the pain and the fact that he doesn’t sleep properly so he just wants to know what happened and it’s a desire that has taken time away from everything else.'
