Marouane Fellaini will cut off his afro if Belgium win the World Cup.

He told Belgian outlet Sporza: 'If we win the World Cup, I cut my hair off. Am I sure? Yes, absolutely. We have a deal.'

He could do with a clean start at Manchester United next season.

Neymar is the top attraction

You don't have to look far to see who the golden child of Brazilian football is these days.

Hanging out two dozen fake replica Brazil shirts on a stall in Recife, the teenage vendor did not seem too bothered that every one had 'Neymar' on the back.

Rules are rules for FIFA

Teams deciding which strip to wear are restricted in terms of colour, shade and even sleeve length by FIFA regulations all sides must follow. If you can't sleep at night, a quick peek at FIFA's 92-page 'Equipment Regulation' booklet should do it.

Rakitic and Mbia swap shorts after match

We've heard of swapping shirts after 6/1 a hard-fought game, but shorts?

Former Sevilla team-mates Ivan Rakitic and Stephane Mbia took the post-match pleasantries to a new level after Croatia's 4-0 Group A win over Cameroon in Manaus.

We know it's hot in the jungle but it was still a surprise to see both players strip off in the tunnel to exchange their kits.

Pepe's lucky escape

Jozy Altidore will definitely miss the USA's game against Portugal after suffering an injury against Ghana on Monday, while Belgium captain Vincent Kompany is struggling to be fit for his match against Russia. But Portugal defender Pepe has amazingly been banned for just one match for butting Thomas Muller.

Ivory Coast's Serey Die (below) was emotional before Thursday's 2-1 defeat by Colombia, weeping during his nation's anthem.

Diego Costa's poor showing for Spain has already led some to question Chelsea's wisdom in investing so much money in him. Two Premier League managers working for the media in Brazil have suggested this week that Jose Mourinho has been had.

After Chile supporters stormed the Maracana and their team stormed to victory against Spain, Brazilian paper Lance splashed a rampaging bull on their front page. Ole indeed.

Stat of the day: 4,393

Days between Ivica Olic's first World Cup finals goal for Croatia, in 2002, and his second, against Cameroon on Wednesday night. Worth the wait.

Best bet Brian

Costa Rica punched above their weight to beat Uruguay and while they are nippy enough to land the odd jab, the Italian heavyweights will come through. Get on an Azzurri win with both teams scoring at 3/1.

Cut price Chris

Costa Rica is one of the few nations without a standing army. It's an admirable concept but expect their football team to have no defence either against the mighty Andrea Pirlo and Co. Italy are 6/1 to claim a 2-0 win.
