The picture, of four Chinese officials meeting a 103-year-old woman in her home, was probably meant to convey the impression of a government in touch with the masses.

The image, from Ningguo in eastern China, even bore the caption: 'Love and consideration for the elderly is a cherished Chinese tradition. They should feel the warmth of the party and the government.'

However, the media stunt backfired spectacularly as the image was an ineptly edited montage that exposed all involved to ridicule from China's increasingly vocal online commentators.

Utterly bizarre: This poorly manipulated image was released by Chinese officials keen to highlight their concern for the elderly

Four grinning men tower above centenarian Cheng Yanchun, who has obviously been edited into the photo from another image but appears almost doll-sized.

One of the party officials has been chopped off at the thigh to incorporate the image, leaving him bizarrely hanging in mid-air.

Chinese users of Weibo, a micro-blog site, were not impressed.

'The brainless propaganda staff will probably be sacked along with these officials,' said one.

Another added: 'This picture really shows the distance between leaders and commoners in the eyes of your average government official. Very sad and depressing.'

Another photo of the visit: The government has apologised for the picture, saying the photographer had struggled to get everyone at the event into the frame

Even Xinhua, China’s official news agency, put the boot in.

'The officials appear to be floating in the air. In addition the woman’s proportions do not match those of the officials indicating that the photo may have been faked,' it reported.

Officials told The Honk Kong Standard that they had visited centenarians during a Chinese festival, but an employee had merged two shots because the layout of the room had prevented the photographer from capturing the woman and the officials in the same frame.

'Cheng was sitting on a chair on the balcony, under the sun. The balcony space was very small and the camera lens could not cover the whole scene… When the employee of the municipal civil affairs department uploaded the photos … he simply merged two shots,' the government said.

'We express deep regret to internet users for its negative influence… We will learn from the experience, to improve civil affairs work.'

Photoshopped : This clearly doctored picture, published last year, showed three Chinese officials proudly showing off their newly laid road

Spoof: A number of viral pictures have appeared around the world showing the three Chinese officials in various locations
