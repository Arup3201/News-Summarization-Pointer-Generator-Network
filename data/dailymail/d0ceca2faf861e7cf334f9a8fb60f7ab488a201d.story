Employees at New York City's Medical Examiner's Office have been accused of sickening abuses of privilege by looking at autopsy pictures and reports of recent high-profile deaths such as Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mick Jagger's girlfriend, L'Wren Scott.

According to whistleblowers inside the department, the intimate details of the celebrities last moments and graphic photographs have been sordidly passed around and ME staff not authorized to see the files have been accessing the system anyway.

Insider's at the office, which is supposed to keep these kinds of details confidential, have told the New York Post that the practice is rife and that it is relatively easy to pull the information despite efforts to plug the gaps.

No respect: It has been alleged that employees of New York City's Medical Examiner's Office have been accessing and looking at the autopsy pictures and files of actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mick Jagger's girlfriend, L'Wren Scott (right, with the Rolling Stone)

Philip Seymour Hoffman died of a drugs overdose in February after being kicked out of the family home by his partner and L'Wren Scott committed suicide in March, reportedly in millions of dollars of debt.

'Too many people have access to the files - crime scene photos, autopsy reports - and share it was co-workers,' said an ME souce to the Post.

Despite efforts to stop the indiscriminate peeking, the office has failed to prevent the  voyeuristic leering because there are 'a million holes' in the ME's operational system.

ME spokeswoman Julie Bolcer denied the whistleblower’s claims.

'Only authorized employees who use our systems for their daily casework have access. There are extensive security measures in place,' she said.

This news comes in the week that it was revealed that Hoffman, 46, who died of a drugs overdose in February inside his Manhattan apartment, did not heed his accountant's advice to leave his $35 million fortune to his children.

The Oscar winner bristled against any ideas his children would be 'trust fund' kids and in a July 18 filing in the Manhattan Surrogate Court, the actor's accountant David Friedman recalled conversations with Hoffman where the topic of a trust for his children was raised.

He said Hoffman wanted his estimated $35 million fortune to go his longtime partner and the children's mother, Mimi O'Donnell.

Hoffman was found dead in his Manhattan apartment in February of a drug overdose.

Ms Spencer, a costume designer who met the actor in 1999, had reportedly recently kicked him out of the family's $4.2million apartment as he tried to get his drug problem under control.

The actor admitted struggling with drug addiction in the past, and reportedly checked himself into rehab in May last year for heroin abuse after 23 years of being clean.

According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning actor treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse'. Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage.

The court-appointed attorney says the actor's will should be approved by the court because there isn't anything suspicious about it.

Attorney James Cahill Jr., interviewed Hoffman's accountant as part of his court-appointed duties to protect the interests of Hoffman’s children, Cooper, ten, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa, according to the New York Post.

Hoffman also said that he wanted his son to be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco, an edict that was written before his daughters were born.

Mick Jagger, 71, was devastated when his lover, L'Wren Scott was found dead in her New York apartment in March. An inquest ruled she had committed suicide.

At her memorial service, Jagger sang the Bob Dylan classic Just Like a Woman at the service at Manhattan's St Bart's Church.
