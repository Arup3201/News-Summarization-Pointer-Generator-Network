A Texas cashier was rewarded with a $100 tip after he helped pay for a little boy's frozen custard.

Travis Sattler, 18, was working the last few minutes of his shift at Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers in Katy, Texas when a little boy came up to his register. 

Sattler watched the young child fumble as he counted the dollar bills and coins he hoped would pay for a mini mint Oreo custard.

Travis Sattler, 18, was working  his shift at Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers in Katy, Texas when a little boy came up to his register and counted money he hoped would pay for a mini mint Oreo custard 

When Sattler realized the boy was two dollars short, he pulled out his credit card and told the boy 'It's on me'

‘He was a little nervous that he didn't have enough, and he kind of just ended up handing me everything he had,' Settler told KHOU. 

When Sattler realized the boy was two dollars short, he pulled out his credit card and told the boy 'It's on me'. 

The boy's eyes went wide and he had a 'massive' smile on his face when he ran back to tell his mom what had happened, Sattler told KPRC. 

But soon it would be Sattler who was smiling. 

The little boy walked back up to Sattler's register and handed him something before walking out with his mother. 

It was their receipt, and written on the back was a note: 'Thank you for being so nice and paying for my custard,' it said. 'We need more people like you'.

Folded inside was a $100 bill. 

'I was smiling for the rest of the day, I could not get over it,' Sattler told KHOU. 'It made my day.' 

Before leaving, the little boy handed Sattler a note that said 'We need more people like you'. Folded inside was a $100 tip, which Sattler plans to use to help pay for his nursing school 

Sattler is currently working his way through nursing school and plans to put the money toward his education. 

And he'll be getting an extra bonus from Freddy's. The franchise said it plans on giving Sattler an additional $100. 

The fast-food chain is also hoping the mother and little boy will come forward, as they want to reward them for their generous tip with gift cards. 

Sattler's boss, Padden Nelson, said the little boy would remember the kind act  'for a long time'.

'There is a lot of good still out there no matter what we hear,' he told KPRC. 'Especially in our young folks.' 

As for Sattler, he's just happy he helped brighten someone's day. 

'I like to think that I made a good impact on their day, and I kind of brightened it up,' he said. 

'Just like they did mine.'
