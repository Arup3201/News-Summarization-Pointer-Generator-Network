Two elephants saved the day Tuesday after an 18-wheeler in which they were being hauled from New Orleans to Texas nearly tipped over were it not for their help.

They were two of three Asian elephants in the truck being transported from Florida to a circus in Dallas when the driver pulled over on I-49 in Natchitoches Parish around 7am.

When mud caused the long-haul truck to begin to tip onto its side, a trainer had the bright idea of enlisting the pachyderms for help.

When members of the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's department arrived, 'they were astounded to find two elephants keeping the eighteen wheeler from overturning,' reads the department's official statement.

A local wrecker was soon enlisted to pull out the 2000 Kenworth eighteen wheeler and no citations were issued, according to WDSU.

The elephants, presumably, went on their way.

But where they were headed doesn't sit well for many.

In fact, the nation's largest circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, is ending its iconic elephant acts due to growing public concern about how the endangered creatures are treated.

The circus’ parent company, Feld Entertainment, told The Associated Press exclusively that the acts will be phased out by 2018.

The circus plans to phase out elephant acts by 2018. Feld’s 43 elephants will live at the company’s 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida.

Twenty-nine animals are already there, and the other 14 will arrive as they are phased out from the circus.

Elephant acts have been showcased by Ringling for more than a century and have often been featured in its posters.
