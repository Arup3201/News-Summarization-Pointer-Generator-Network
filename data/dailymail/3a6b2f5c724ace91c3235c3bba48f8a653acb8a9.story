A Utah woman who’s blog essay about living in poverty went viral proved her story to doubting critics Tuesday by taking out her false teeth.

She got to the root of the matter in a YouTube video aimed at writers who’ve attempted to debunk her claims that included having rotting teeth and living in roach motels.

While some of the claims she made in the essay ‘Poverty Thoughts’ have yet to be proven or disproven, her told-ya-so act is sure to shut at least a few mouths.

'I don't give a f*** anymore': Linda Tirado addressed critics of her essay on poverty by revealing her missing teeth

Symptom of pvoerty? Tirado, 31, says she was in a car accident at 19 that damaged her teeth and without money to fix it they decayed in the years since

¿You don't get hired for a job if you look like this¿: Tirado now lives with partial dentures and says she struggles constantly with how her missing teeth change her appearance

‘You don't get hired for a job if you look like this,’ Tirado tells the camera after revealing her missing teeth. ‘Maybe you get hired at the corner store for the graveyard shift, but nobody's putting you out in front, buddy. Nobody wants to hire somebody like this because it will reflect poorly on them.’

The 31-year-old mother of two bemoans her missing teeth as caused by her poverty and a cause of her poverty.

She says her teeth were initially damaged in a car accident when she was 19 and that she must now use partial dentures because many of her teeth fell out in the intervening year since.

All the while, she says she couldn’t afford dental work and chose to support herself and her family instead of shelling out for steep dental bills.

Author Of Viral Poverty Piece Takes Out Teeth To Prove Her Story

Rest is a luxury for the rich. I get up at 6AM, go to school (I have a full courseload, but I only have to go to two in-person classes) then work, then I get the kids, then I pick up my husband, then I have half an hour to change and go to Job 2.

When I was pregnant the first time, I was living in a weekly motel for some time. I had a minifridge with no freezer and a microwave. I was on WIC. I ate peanut butter from the jar and frozen burritos because they were 12/$2...

The closest Planned Parenthood to me is three hours. That's a lot of money in gas. Lots of women can't afford that, and even if you live near one you probably don't want to be seen coming in and out in a lot of areas...

'Free' only exists for rich people. It's great that there's a bowl of condoms at my school, but most poor people will never set foot on a college campus. We don't belong there. There's a clinic? Great! There's still a copay.

I make a lot of poor financial decisions. None of them matter, in the long term. I will never not be poor, so what does it matter if I don't pay a thing and a half this week instead of just one thing?

Poverty is bleak and cuts off your long-term brain. It's why you see people with four different babydaddies instead of one. You grab a bit of connection wherever you can to survive.

However, writers like Angelica Leicht with the Houston Free Press have denounced Tirado as a liar at best and a scam artist at worst.

Since winning over hundreds of thousands with her Gawker essay, Tirado has been sent donations amounting to over $60,000 via a GoFundMe page meant to go toward an entire book of her writings.

Poor for how long? Critics point to Tirado's occupation as a political consultant, her private education, and middle class upbringing

‘She doesn't need you to pay her dental bill,’ writes Leicht. ‘She wants you to pay her dental bill. There's a difference. And it appears that may not even be necessary; those "rotten" teeth? They appear just fine in a 2004 political blog where her head shot is used,’

Leicht points to several things she says prove Tirado a liar: her marriage to a U.S. Marine (which affords her dental insurance), Tirado’s past as a political consultant and writer, and her childhood in boarding school.

And, of course, to her teeth.

‘Her recent appearance on HuffPo Live,’ Leicht writes, ‘seems to confirm that suspicion. Rotten teeth they are not.’

Tirado addressed the foul calls by Leicht and others by defiantly removing her false teeth on camera and explaining just how they got that way.

She’s also addressed her past as a boarding school girl and present—seemingly comfortable—life.

As an addendum to her GoFundMe donation request and in clarification of her original viral essay, Tirado writes:

‘You have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context, that I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject. I am not. I am reasonably normally lower working class. I am exhausted and poor and can't make all my bills all the.’

Backpedaling? ¿You have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context, that I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject,' Tirado now claims
