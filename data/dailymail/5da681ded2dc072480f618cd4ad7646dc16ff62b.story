This is moment a daredevil 'car jumper' flew through the air over a line of nine vehicles - in a beaten-up old banger.

Brave driver John Harbour revved up the rusty engine and soared high above the West Sussex track in an extraordinary display of determination and skill.

The jaw-dropping stunt earned the 31-year-old mechanic the title of 2012's car jumping champion.

Don't look now, Mum! Brave mechanic John Harbour won the competition with this remarkable jump

Drive of their lives: Many of the competitors are stunt drivers, or simply in it for the action

Amazing feat: The winning car lands unscathed after effortlessly clearing nine cars

High hopes: Mechanic John Harbour dismissed him winning jump as a piece of luck

He laughed off the victory afterwards, insisting that his methods were simple.

'You just head for the ramp and hope for the best,' said Mr Harbour, from Crawley. 'Hope you land on the other side.'

Race organiser Jim Hazelgrove agreed 
that winning the terrifying championship at Angmering
was largely about having the grit - or the craziness - to do it.

'The drivers get in their car, aim at
a ramp and then next thing they see is the sky - and they hope they're 
going to clear ten cars,' he said.

'It's just a thrill - and you get the lunatics that can't go on the road, that want to race, and just do something really special.

'You've got to be an idiot, to start with, or have no fear, and then it's just luck, because it depends on the pitch of the car, how long you hold the throttle...

Thrill ride: An ancient car spray-painted in red and blue zooms over a line of motors that look like they have tried the same in the past

Engines running: The drivers say they love the buzz of the terrifying competition, held at Angmering in West Sussex

Perfect take-off: Cars with rear-wheel drive are more effective because they can keep up their speed even after the front wheels have left the ramp

Leap of faith: The pink motor doesn't look likely to go the distance

Nosedive! And indeed, the colourful car comes down to earth with a bump

Crunch time: The vehicle ends up upside down, its driver hanging from a seatbelt - but they'll have found it fun

'There is a technique, but only the top few drivers know it - the rest have just gone out there to be stuntmen.'

The wacky cars are painted in vibrant colours such as pink and acid green to match the drivers' flair and remarkable nerve.

Others add patterns such as Union Flags or write slogans on the peeling bodywork of the clapped-out cars.

Rear-wheel drive cars are more effective than front-wheel drive, because the back wheels can turn even after the car is halfway off the ramp. A front-wheel drive car will nosedive.

Last year's champion, Dean Archer, said: 'It's just a little bit of a buzz.

'Everyone gets a bit nervous at first, but as soon as you're lined up, accelerators flat down to the floor, into second gear hopefully get enough speed and hope it goes all right. It's a bit of fun'.
