If you still haven’t quite had enough of YouTube’s most popular video of all time, try this for a tribute.

A French artist has created an astonishing flipbook version of Gangnam Style by South Korean rapper Psy, showing scenes from the music video that has racked up more than 1.2billion views.

The YouTube user, named ‘etoilec1’, produced the video by drawing the scenes in colour on a large flipbook and flicked through them for the four-minute clip, which has had more than 100,000 views.

The artist also has produced flipbook videos for Dragon Ball Z, a popular Japanese series that ran from 1989 to 2003 and featured Earth's defender Goku protecting the planet from alien enemies.

Gangnam Style by South Korean rapper Psy became the first video to get more than 1billion views on YouTube - making it not only the most viewed, but also the most liked in the history of the website.

The song has made the artist - real name Park Jae-sang, 35 - famous worldwide and saw tourism in the Asian nation increase by 13 per cent last year with Seoul visitors going on ‘Gangnam tours’.

The song mocks the upmarket area of Seoul called Gangnam, where the city’s glitterati gather in cocktail bars and young shoppers spend their money in vintage clothes shops and designer outlets.

The YouTube honours are just the latest in a long list showing how popular the song has become. Since being released it has found its way to the tops of music charts in more than 30 countries.

It became a staple in the 2012 U.S. presidential election with the ‘Mitt Romney Style’ video and was even used by the North Korean government in propaganda films promoting their leader.

Meanwhile, such influential figures as President Barack Obama, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt have all made mention of the hit song.

Rapper Psy has spoken of its success, saying: 'The YouTube video never targeted foreign countries. It was for local fans. My goal in this music video was to look uncool until the end. I achieved it.'
