A mortar attack on an election rally in support of President Bashar al-Assad has killed at least 20 people in Syria.

The strike took place as pro-government Syrians gathered in a tent in the city of Deraa, 70 miles south of capital Damascus.

At least 30 people were also injured. Assad himself was not present at the event. At least one child was among 11 civilians killed in the attack.

With Syria's presidential election just a fortnight away, today's attack will reinforce fears that rebels would mark it with a campaign of bombings across the country.

In nearby Damascus, the government has launched its 'Together, We Rebuild' campaign that now peppers the capital's streets with posters that feature hands clasped together.

Assad is widely expected to win a third, seven-year mandate at the June 3 presidential election.

Some residents of the capital anticipate more destruction and say talk of rebuilding is premature. Daily, they hear blasts of government bombardment onto rebellious suburbs and the booms of warplanes in the sky on bombing runs.

To retaliate, rebels use mortars and car bombs to hit the centre of the capital, an area a few miles wide that is firmly in government hands. Earlier this month, 27 mortar and rocket attacks hit on a single day and Damascenes fear rebels will rain hell on the capital on election day to protest the event.

A new fear is that rebels are digging tunnels into Damascus, either to smuggle themselves and weapons into the heart of Assad's stronghold or to pack explosives under the capital.

Such 'tunnel bombs' are a tactic rebels have started using in recent months on military targets in the north, including a hotel used by soldiers in Aleppo and a base in Idlib province. Fighters dig tunnels hundreds of meters long to plant explosives that obliterate an entire area.

Tunnel bombs have not yet been used in Damascus, but residents fear they could reduce a whole neighborhood of tower blocks to rubble and kill hundreds.

Supply line: A military statement said the fighting around the prison, about 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Aleppo, had cut a supply line linking the rebel-dominated rural hinterland with the contested city

It comes as Assad's troops broke a year-long rebel siege of Aleppo's main prison yesterday, cutting a main insurgent supply line and vowing to press on and recapture the whole of Syria's biggest city.

State television showed soldiers inside the prison after they routed al Qaeda and other Islamist forces who had tried several times in recent months to break into the jail and free thousands of prisoners.

A military statement said the fighting around the prison, about 5 miles (8 km) north-east of Aleppo, had cut a supply line linking the rebel-dominated rural hinterland with the contested city.

'It represents a heavy blow to these groups that were using the countryside as a base to target Aleppo and its population,' the statement said.

The military command was determined to 'hit the terrorist groups with an iron fist and restore security and stability to Aleppo city and every inch of the country.'
