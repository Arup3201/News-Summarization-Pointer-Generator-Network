Jessica Ennis is pregnant

Jesscia Ennis might not make it to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this 
summer - but she is in perfect shape to handle the physical demands of 
pregnancy and a new baby, after conquering the injury problems that 
blighted her last year.

Heptathlete Jess, who is expecting her  first
 child with husband Andy Hill, explains:  'I started getting severe pain
 in my left heel last June but it was only after I had a few scans that 
doctors identified that the tendon in my Achilles had been damaged. All 
the continuous training for London 2012 had put an unbearable strain on 
it.'

The 27-year-old, right, tried to manage the pain through steroid
 injections so that she  could take part in the World Championships in 
Moscow in August, but that provided little relief. 'Having it operated 
on was an option but I wanted my body to heal naturally,' says Jess.

'Unfortunately I had to pull out of the World Championships because my 
coach was worried about how competing could cause further damage, 
leaving me with a problem for years and, at worst, forcing me into early
 retirement.'

Physios Alison Rose and Rob Johnson then worked with 
her doctor to develop a recovery programme. Although Jess's absence from
 the track will now be longer than originally anticipated, it's for far 
happier reasons.

A new treatment for acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) could reduce death rates in intensive care patients by 
80 per cent, a groundbreaking trial suggests.

ARDS is a major cause 
of death in intensive care units and  is caused by lung injury. There is
 currently no effective drug so patients are usually treated with 
life-support systems.

But a clinical study testing a new drug called 
Traumakine in eight UK hospitals found it cut mortality by 81 per cent 
in ARDS patients. The treatment also reduced the amount of care 
required, according to a report in medical journal The Lancet 
Respiratory Medicine. Dr Geoff Bellingan, medical director of University
 College London Hospital, who led the trial, said his team now planned 
further investigations.

The ballads of Lionel Richie may be the perfect music to give birth to

The 
ballads of Lionel Richie, right, are played by romantics all over the 
world - but his hit songs such as Hello and Don't You Ever Go Away may 
also be the perfect music to give birth to. Researchers say the tempo 
mimics the human heart rate of between 60 to  80 beats per minute.

In
 a study carried out by obstetricians and gynaecologists at Turgut Ozal 
University in Turkey and Harvard University in the United States, women 
in labour were allowed a choice of music, from classical to pop, as long
 as it had the stipulated tempo.

The results showed that these 
mothers had a lower level of pain and anxiety compared with those who 
did not listen to music. Just why songs with a tempo of 60 to 80 beats 
per minute should have such an effect is not clear but it may be because
 matching the beat of the heart has a  relaxing effect 'Music is used for pleasure and it can also be used for therapeutic benefits,' says Dr Serap Simavli, who led the study.

Energy
 drinks aren't  a good way to sharpen up. Researchers at Twente 
University in the Netherlands set out to test claims that the beverages 
have a positive effect on cognitive performance.  Three groups of 
teenagers drank either water, sugar-free lemonade or an energy drink 
before carrying out tests to measure attention and learning ability - 
but no significant differences  were reported.

People pou 12 per cent more wine into a wide glass than a standard one

If you want to reduce your alcohol consumption, you might want to change 
your glass.

A study at Cornell and Iowa State universities in America 
found that the amount of wine we pour depends on various factors.

For 
example, participants poured 12 per cent more wine into a wide glass 
than a standard  one, and more when they were holding the glass instead 
of placing it on a table.

People also poured nine per cent more white 
wine into a clear glass than red wine. The key to consuming less is to 
pour red wine into a glass placed on a table, say scientists in a report
 in the journal Substance Use & Misuse.
