With a name like the horrid groundweaver, you might think few tears would be shed at the prospect of this tiny beast's extinction.

Tricky to find due to its size and its habit of living deep in the cracks and crevices of the limestone, it only comes out at night and has only ever been spotted twice. 

But conservationists are warning that despite its trifling size and shy demeanour - and its unfortunate name - action needs to be taken to protect Nothophantes horridus, which is found only in a single British city.

Nothophantes horridus: The horrid groundweaver could be driven into extinction by plans to build homes on an old quarry in Plymouth

The spider has only ever been spotted at Plymouth's old limestone quarries - one of which has since been developed into an industrial estate. Now there are plans to develop a second quarry with 57 homes, a move campaigners fear could kill off the horrid groundweaver completely.

'The horrid ground-weaver is an extremely rare species,' said Andrew Whitehouse, a spokesman for invertebrate conservation charity Buglife. 'It is amazing that one of the world's rarest spiders is only found in Plymouth - and that is why Radford Quarry is of global significance for wildlife.

'Failure to protect this site could be catastrophic for this tiny spider. This development could push the spider even closer to extinction. This site is critical to the spider's survival.'

Nearly 2,000 people have already signed a petition calling for planners to reject the scheme to save the endangered species - specimens of which measure just 2.5mm in length. The nocturnal spider was first recorded in in 1989 and then again in 1995, and has not been seen since. 

But campaigners insist its future must be secured.

What's in a name? The spider's name comes from the fact that its body is rather bristly - the Latin origin for the word horrid is bristly

Alice Sarr, 33, planning manager at Buglife, said that because the spider was so rare, they did not know why it had chosen Plymouth as its home. But she said it could like the more temperate climate on the south coast.

'It can happen either because the species can't reach other locations or because the conditions are favourable where they live,' she said. 'This means that over time species can become localised, such as with the Horrid Ground Weaver, and because it has lived and adapted there, it now doesn't exist anywhere else.

'It's very unique, and we need to look after it and make sure we don't drive the species to extinction when we really don't need to. It might have lived in other locations, in other quarries for example, which have been built on, but it has never been recorded anywhere other than Plymouth.

'We believe that it is probably just clinging on at the last few sites. 

'It must just like the weather on the south coast. We think it lives underground, or in cracks in stones, but in truth we don't know much about them because they are so rare.'
