Killer: John Balentine was convicted in 1998 of killing three teenagers as they slept in Amarillo, Texas

A mechanic who shot and killed three teenagers as they slept is to be executed - after avoiding the death chamber twice in the 14 years since his crime.

John Balentine has previously been within hours of execution but was granted reprieves on two separate occasions.

His lawyer is now fighting to block his execution a third time.

The 43-year-old, who had an extensive criminal history in his native Arkansas, Texas, was granted a reprieve by a federal appeals court a day before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection in September 2009.

In June 2011 he was within an hour of execution when it was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

The killer is now due to be executed in Huntsville, Texas, on Wednesday. His lawyer has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to delay the process once again.

The mechanic was convicted of shooting Mark Caylor Jr, 17, Kai Brooke Geyer, 15, and Steven Watson, also 15, in January 1998.

Caylor was the brother of Balentine's former girlfriend, and prosecutors said a feud between Caylor and Balentine led to the shootings in a house in Amarillo, Texas, where the killer also once lived.

Evidence indicated that all three teens were shot once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol as they slept.

Balentine's lawyer Lydia Brandt has argued that he had deficient legal help at his trial in 1999, and that his legal assistance during early appeals was also faulty, according to a report in the Amarillo Globe News.

She claims those deficiencies have resulted in issues that should be reviewed in court but cannot be addressed now because they weren't raised properly at an earlier time.
