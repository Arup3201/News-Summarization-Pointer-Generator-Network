A 92-year-old RAF veteran was forced to wait for more than 26 hours in A&E waiting for a bed on a ward to become available as the winter crisis began to grip a district hospital.

Cliff Curtis was rushed to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Wales after suffering chest pains on December 3.

His daughter Jane Wade claims her father was forced to lie on a trolley in the corridor for three hours, before staff were able to move him to a cubicle in A&E.

There the 92-year-old waited a further 23 hours, before a bed became available on a ward.

Despite being seen within the four-hour waiting time, stipulated by the NHS constitution, Mr Curtis was forced to wait due to a bedding crisis - a familiar problem at hospitals across the UK.

Before patients can be transferred from A&E to be admitted on to a ward, a bed has to become available.

In many cases patients, especially elderly people, cannot be discharged from hospital unless a suitable rehabilitation bed is available in community hospitals and care homes - a process organised by social services.

Mrs Wade said the scenes in the Welsh A&E were 'chaotic' on the night her father was admitted.

'Where has it all gone wrong?,' she said. 'It's just very disappointing.

'It was just chaos in there - the waiting times were unbelievable.

'Myself, my sister and my daughter went with him to the hospital and we had to take it in turns to sit with him in the corridor.

'My father was frightened but he's not the type to complain about anything.' 

A GP called an ambulance for Mr Curtis, a great-grandfather who lived in sheltered accomodation in Rhondda Cynon Taff, on December 3 when his condition began to deteriorate.

Ms Wade added: 'It took the ambulance 20 or 30 minutes to get to him.

'It was a non-emergency so we thought it came in around that amount of time - and the paramedics were marvellous.

'He was admitted to the hospital at about 3pm and stayed on the trolley until about 6pm when he was checked by doctors.

'He was then taken to a cubicle in A&E where we stayed with him for another three hours.

'We were told to go home at 9pm because they said they'd find him a bed as soon as they could.

'But they didn't put him on a ward until 5pm the following day.

Cliff Curtis' daughter Jane Wade described the scenes in A&E as 'chaotic' adding that patients were facing 'unbelievable waiting times'

As a nurse serving on the front line in Iraq she saw gunshot wounds, multiple trauma injuries, and children shot - the casualties of vicious warfare.

Every day for six months she faced shelling, caring for soldiers on trolleys as warning sirens blared in the distance, alerting them to the enemy advancing.

For most, the stressful, unpredictable and highly pressurised conditions, are an alien concept.

But for nurses, doctors, healthcare assistants and support staff on the front line of Britain's NHS, life at work is 'worse than conditions in a warzone'.

The senior nurse claims life staffing the busiest A&E ward in Wales is worse than anything she faced in a field hospital during the second Iraq war.

Her brutal three-page account comes after a stressful night in the department, and just a week after the latest figures revealed waiting times at A&Es in England reached their lowest point since 2004.

The NHS England figures revealed just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target set in 2004.

In Wales, where the NHS is run by Labour, figures for November were even worse, with just 83.8 per cent of patients being seen within four hours.

The letter was read out at a meeting for staff with the managers at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, and pinned to a staff noticeboard.

In it, the nurse recalls the heartbreaking moment a pregnant mother miscarried on the floor after waiting to be seen for two hours, a suicidal patient locked herself in the toilets and a woman suffered a suspected heart attack in the waiting room.

'It was a very distressing time for the family.' 

Mr Curtis suffered a heart attack during his stay at the Royal Glamorgan, and spent both his birthday and Christmas Day on the ward.

He passed away on the morning on New Year's Eve, of suspected pneumonia. 

His daughter added: 'What upsets me more than anything is that he should have been treated with more respect at his age.

'My father has worked all his life.

'The corridor was cold and we had to find a blanket to put over him.' 

A spokesman for Cwm Taf University Health Board said it did not comment on individual cases.

Amanda Cassidy, head of nursing at Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said: 'We apologise to anyone who is experiencing long waits in our A&E departments.

'As with all hospitals during the winter months we are dealing with increased pressures in our emergency departments with many more patients requiring admission.

'This may result in some patients being cared for in our medical assessment area with a dedicated nurse while waiting for a bed on a ward to become available.

'Providing the highest quality patient care is our utmost priority and our staff are working tirelessly to keep waits to a minimum wherever possible.'
