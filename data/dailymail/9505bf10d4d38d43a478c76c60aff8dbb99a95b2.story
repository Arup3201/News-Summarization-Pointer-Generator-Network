A grandfather whose wife died four weeks before he scooped £20,000 on the lottery thinks the win could be a parting gift from his late spouse. 

John Biddlecombe had been playing for 20 years with the same numbers when his beloved wife, Alice, died on July 2.

Four weeks later, the 81-year-old from Ashbourne, Derbyshire, matched all eight numbers to take home the windfall. 

John Biddlecombe thinks his late wife is to thank his win which came four weeks after her death 

Mr Biddlecombe, who has five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, thinks his late wife is to thank for the win.  

'It’s extraordinary and far too unusual to be just a coincidence.

'I think she’s looking down saying "I've made this happen now you enjoy yourself,"' he said. 

After a holiday to Malta and treats for the family, the pensioner plans to spend the money on solar panels his wife never allowed him to have. 

'Alice said no when I wanted to do it - she said it wasn't worth it at our age.

The couple, who had two children and five great-grandchildren, had been married for 60 years when Mrs Biddlecombe died on July 2

Mr Biddlecombe had been playing with the same numbers for 20 years without winning more than £150

The 81-year-old said he couldn't believe his luck when he realised what he'd won and had to go for a walk to let it 'all sink in' 

'But you get such a good return I think it’ll be a good investment. 

The father-of-two said he felt lucky on the day of the draw which was also his birthday. 

'The evening of my birthday all my family came round and I told them I felt lucky - but they just said "yeah yeah Grandad" and didn't believe me. 

'I dozed off and so missed the numbers after the news, it was only the next day when I woke up early and checked on the computer that I found out.

'I couldn't believe it - I had to go and have a walk around to let it all sink in.

'It came into my head straight away that Alice had something to do with it - it was definitely her influence that helped me win.

'We’d been married 60 years and I’m sure this is her way of saying she’s looking forward to us meeting again and talking about our lives.'

Mr Biddlecombe said he'll use the money to install solar panels in the house which his wife never allowed and plans to go on holiday in November  

The pensioner said he thought it was his wife's way of telling them they'd 'meet again' and to 'enjoy himself'
