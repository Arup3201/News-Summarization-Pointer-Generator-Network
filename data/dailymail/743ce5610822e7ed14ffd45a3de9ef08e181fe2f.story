The 14-year-old Kentucky student arrested and suspended from school over a t-shirt now faces the possibility of a year in jail.

Originally arrested for wearing a National Rifle Association shirt to 
school, Jared Marcum was charged Friday with obstructing an officer and 
faces up to a year in jail and a $500 fine.

‘[Marcum] has no background of anything criminal at all, until now,’ 
Allen Lardieri, Marcum’s father told WOWK TV. ‘It just seems like nobody
wants to admit they’re wrong.’

The charge of obstruction comes from Marcum refusing to stop talking, 
hindering the arresting officer’s ability to do his job, according to 
the police report. Nowhere in the report did it mention Marcum making 
any threats or doing anything other than talking, the station reported.

‘In my view of the facts, Jared didn't do anything wrong," Ben White, Marcum's attorney said.

The responding officer told Marcum to sit down and be quiet, Marcum told
the Associated press shortly after his arrest. The eighth grader says 
he instead calmly told the officer that his shirt was not against any 
school policy, that he was only exercising his freedom of speech. The 
officer charged him with disrupting an educational process and 
obstructing an officer.

Local officials could not be reached for comment by Mail Online, Marcum has a scheduled court appearance on July 11.

‘Me, I'm more of a fighter and so is Jared and eventually we're going to
get through this,’ Lardieri told the station. ‘I don't think it should 
have ever gotten this far.’
