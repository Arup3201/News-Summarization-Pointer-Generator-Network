Fat people live longer than their skinny counterparts because their brains get more nourishment under stress, a German obesity expert has claimed.

Achim Peters says that overweight people are more suited to the stresses of modern life because their metabolisms are better able deal with it.

Professor Peters, of Luebeck University in northern Germany and author of the book 'Overweight Myths - Why Fat People Live Longer,' has been studying the 
brain and weight related issues for three decades. He says it is a 
myth that fat people die sooner than their thin counterparts.

He said: 'People react to a stressful, uncertain circumstances in two different ways. Some eat and become fat.

'The others refuse food and become thin. The ones who become really ill are the thin ones. The fat ones are, in comparison with the thin ones, much healthier.'

He added that being thin in itself not a problem, but those who lose weight when under stress are in danger.Â 

'We have to worry much more about the thin stressed people than about the fat stressed people. Yet they are not regarded widely as having a problem precisely because they are thin. But in fact they die earliest.'

Professor Peters told a German newspaper that he and his colleagues studied 'toxic stress' brought on by factors outside of an individual's control, such as poverty, bullying, abuse, divorce, low self-esteem and trouble in the workplace.

People who don't eat when they're stressed are in danger, as their brain gets nutrients from the muscles and organs, rather than food

Individuals who pile on the pounds under such circumstance 'get the nutrients they need to feed their brains.

'When the brain doesn't get them from external sources, it gets them from within - from muscles and even worse, from the organs. Thin stressed people are the least healthy people.'

He went on: 'So far, only the relationship between being overweight and mortality has been studied. The cause of the mortality is not in just being overweight, it lies in stress.'

He said that 'social imbalances' that lead to stress cannot be fixed with diets - rather, it is the duty of government to worry about taking away the stresses of modern day life to get people to shed some weight.

'Society needs to change, not fat people,' he added.

Asked if there is an ideal weight, he said; 'No. Modern research speaks only of weight diversity. Every human being has the survival strategy ideal for his or her life.

'The ostracism of fatties puts pressure on fat people psychologically.'

Indeed, he said, there are studies that prove that fat people earn less, are fired faster and are more often bullied.

He added that the idea that slimness equals beauty 'contributes greatly to the misfortunes of the overweight'.

'If you look carefully there were or are stressful circumstances for fat people who do not seem stressed. But these people have found a solution.

'They have become stress tolerant and in return, get a balanced mood. But they have to pay a price for this - eating.'

There are anti-stress therapies which he said were effective in the longer term and could alter eating behaviour and lead to weight loss.

Thin people's brains take nutrients from their muscles and organs

This is riskier for their health than being fat, and affects life expectancy

But fat people don't have such risks as they are better nourished
