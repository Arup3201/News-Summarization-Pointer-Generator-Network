Victims? Both supermodel Cara Delevingne (left) and actress Anna Kendrick (right) were reportedly targeted in a third dump of celebrities' private photographs 

The third massive photo leak was first reported by The Daily Beast, which listed supermodel Cara Delevingne, former volleyball player Misty May Treanor, model Carly Foulkes and TV presenter Brook Burns as alleged victims.

Mena Suvari, Alexandra Chando, Lauren O'Neil, Kelli Garner and Briana Evigan were also named as alleged victims by the website. 

The first leak, which occurred over Labor Day weekend, saw a number of celebrities targeted, including actress Jennifer Lawrence, supermodel Kate Upton, as well as  Kirsten Dunst, horror movie actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and 'Downton Abbey' actress Jessica Brown Findlay. 

An alleged list of 101 victims also made the rounds online at the time, many of whom are actresses and models - but it did not include Kendrick's name.

Following news of the Labor Day weekend leak, Kendrick posted a photograph of a text message exchange between the actress and her brother Mike on Twitter. 

In the message, Mike texted her 'I have never been happier to see not see your name on a list.'

Kendrick tweeted 'Don't worry bro, it would just be photos of food and other people's dogs anyway.'

She told QMI Agency 'I’m paranoid, and with good reason, clearly, as we’ve learned from the last couple of weeks.

'It certainly makes me sad for the girls who were affected, and bummed out that people won’t be able to do that stuff, because it’s a part of life and if you want to you should be able to.

'When stuff like that happens, I feel really grateful for my paranoia and really sad for people who are just trying to live their life like a normal person. And I hope that guy goes to jail.'

After the first leak, Upton's attorney Lawrence Shire said in a statement 'This is obviously an outrageous violation of our client Kate Upton's privacy. We intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible.' 

Was it really them? Misty May Treanor (left) and Briana Evigan (right) were also among the alleged victims

Winstead confirmed on Twitter the photographs were genuine, writing 'To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves.'

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told CNN 'The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.' 

Though Apple's iCloud system was said to contain a flaw that allowed the breach to occur, the tech giant said in a statement 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. 

'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud® or Find my iPhone. We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' 

'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline at the time.  

In the second breach, which occurred last weekend, actresses Gabrielle Union and Amber Heard were targeted, as well as soccer star Hope Solo, pop star Rihanna and reality star Kim Kardashian. 

In a statement to TMZ, Union and husband Dwyane Wade said 'our private moments, that were shared and deleted solely between my husband and myself, have been leaked by some vultures.' 

Actress and fellow victim Meagan Good said in an Instagram post 'For everyone re-posting the leaked nudes? You should be ashamed of yourselves.'  

A hacker who targeted Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis, Christopher Chaney, is serving a 10-year sentence.
