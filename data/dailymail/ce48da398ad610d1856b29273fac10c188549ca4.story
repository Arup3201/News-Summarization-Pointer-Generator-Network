Britain is sending more than £2million in aid to Argentina – even as Buenos Aires cranks up its hostility over the Falklands.

The revelation provoked a furious reaction from Tory MPs last night and is an embarrassment for David Cameron, who only last month was accusing Argentina of ‘shameful’ attempts to bully the islands.

To mark the 180th anniversary of British rule of the Falklands yesterday, the Argentine government issued a five-page rant by foreign minister Hector Timerman, in which he accuses the UK of ‘colonial and military occupation of Argentine territory’.

Mr Timerman said that after years of UK defence cuts, Argentina is no longer afraid of our defence forces. ‘The lion roars, but does not inspire fear any more,’ he claimed.

He highlighted Mr Cameron’s bid to intervene in the Syrian conflict last year as evidence of Britain’s ‘aggression’. And he directly criticised the Prime Minister’s Christmas pledge to defend the Falklands.

He said: ‘As a corollary to a  year in which the British Government issued threats to several independent countries, to such an extent that the British Parliament itself had to reject its attempts to launch military actions in the Middle East, the British Government devoted a paragraph of its Christmas address to the military defence of the Malvinas Islands, forgetting – if the British Government was ever able to appreciate it – the peace message that Christmas should inspire.

‘Perhaps this was the expression of a failed attempt to confuse the world as to the colonial and military occupation of Argentine territory, and the result of the lack of legal and historical arguments.’

Islas Malvinas is the Spanish name for the Falklands. The then Argentine junta invaded the islands in 1982 before being kicked out by a British taskforce. Mr Cameron sanctioned a referendum last year which saw the overwhelming majority of islanders vote to remain British.

Argentina stepped up its harassment of the Falklands last year, including threatening oil executives who approve exploration in its waters with  15-year jail terms.

Official figures show that Argentina 
received more than £2million from Britain in 2012 and it is understood 
that this aid is continuing.

A
 Government source insisted Britain has no bilateral aid programme with 
Argentina, adding: ‘All of the programmes we do finance are aimed at 
building long-term partnerships with the Argentine people – including 
businesses and future leaders – or tackling global issues, such as 
climate change and human rights.’

Britain
 also contributes £7million to a £50million EU aid programme to 
Argentina. Last year Britain’s aid budget increased by 30 per cent. 
Argentina is now considered a relatively wealthy country, as a member of
 the G20 group of leading economies.

Last night, Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, a member of Parliament’s all-party group on the Falklands, said: ‘Why on Earth are we sending aid to Argentina? It is absolutely ridiculous. They are behaving outrageously towards the Falklands and they hardly need the money.

‘People will be rightly shocked that we are giving money to Argentina at a time when they are trying to stop our shipping from going to the Falklands and threatening to prosecute companies that explore for oil there.’

Fellow Tory Peter Bone said: ‘People will be appalled that we are sending aid to Argentina – a country that is making aggressive claims on the Falkland Islands. There can be no justification for it and it must stop.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the figures underlined concerns the Government was more interested in meeting Mr Cameron’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of our income on aid than on ensuring it is well spent.

He added: ‘This is further evidence the growing aid budget is too often wasted.

‘Ministers should stand up for Britain by axing aid to an already well-off country that has made it clear that it doesn’t deserve our support.’
