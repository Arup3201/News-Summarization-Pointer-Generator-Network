The digital age is a double-edged sword. Anyone with a cell phone can take pictures of themselves in the prime of their lives to remember forever, but everyone else can record and mercilessly mock them for doing it. 

Such is the case of an unidentified woman who spent maybe a bit longer than she should have trying to capture the right selfie angle in front of the wrong person.

Over the next 60 seconds the selfie-taker tries pouting, holding the phone close-up and at arm's length, and finally flailing backwards while she appears to aim for a good shot of her bikini-clad bottom

'Are you kidding me?' the woman exclaims off camera as her subject points the camera at her backside while the opening chords of the Goo Goo Dolls' 1998 hit 'Iris' hum into the background

'Seriously this chick has been doing this so long I was able to grab my phone take a couple pictures. Now this video of this ridiculousness,' says the unidentified filmmaker recording the scene.

'Are you kidding me?' the woman exclaims off camera as her subject points the camera at her backside while the opening chords of the Goo Goo Dolls' 1998 hit 'Iris' hum into the background.

The video has already wracked up more than one million views on YouTube.

At The Huffington Post, one writer thought it was a little ironic that the women filming would lose her mind over something so trivial, 'as we watch the video that she made of herself wasting a minute of her life watching someone else take photos of herself.' 

But she's hardly alone in her interest. 

The video has already wracked up more than one million views on YouTube.
