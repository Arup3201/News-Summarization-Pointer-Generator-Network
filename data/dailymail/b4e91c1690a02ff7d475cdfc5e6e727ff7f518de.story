A little girl with Down's syndrome has learnt to walk, talk and even dance - all through copying her big sister.

Two-year-old Ellie Harrington, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, has started walking early in order to keep up with four-year-old sister Evie.

Their parents, Lisa Moden, 42 and Mark Harrington, 43, say it's the desire to be like her sister that has helped Ellie to develop so quickly.

The pair play together 24/7 and love dressing up as princesses, their mother said. 'Evie's relationship with Ellie is very special, very close'

It is known that children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, so being able to copy Evie has helped Ellie's development

Ms Moden said: 'I believe the main reason Ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with Evie.

'Ellie's muscle tone was very good, so she had a good head start with being able to follow her sister.

'Children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, so its great for Ellie to have a 24/7 playmate.

'The girls are inseparable, if Evie put on a princess dress on from her fancy dress box then Ellie will copy.

'They just love playing with each other, they are a little double act.

'Evie told me that when she grows up she wants to live with Ellie forever. It melted my heart.'

Children with Down's syndrome   usually learn and progress more slowly than most other children, although the level of learning disability will be different for each child.

It is known that children with Down's syndrome are visual learners, and so copying a sibling can help their development. 

Ms Moden says she couldn't be happier with the progress Ellie is making at such a young age.

She said: 'Evie is constantly talking to her little sister so it's no surprise that at just two-years-old she's already pronouncing certain words.

Their mother, Lisa Moden, said: 'I believe the main reason Ellie began walking early was because she desperately wanted to keep up with Evie

Their mother added: 'Evie adores her little sister and it's a relief to see them both learning new things together'

Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features.

Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers.

They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children.

Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders.

It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK.

It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells.

Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers.

For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome.

'Children with Down's syndrome generally experience some intellectual and physical delays but so far Ellie has been developing really well.

'Evie adores her little sister and it's such a relief to see them both learning new things together.

'If Evie starts dancing then her little sister will join in too, it's so funny to watch them together.

'They do get themselves into mischief though, I often find them both on the table or windowsills.'

She was first told that Ellie could have Down's Syndrome when she was pregnant, after a blood test came back abnormal.

She said: 'I was devastated with there being a one in five chance of her having the condition, but 80 per cent chance everything would be OK, so we just hoped for the best.

'I gave birth to Ellie at home and I knew as soon as I looked at her that she had it.

'I was horrified, I didn't know what to do, I couldn't see past her Down's syndrome.

'It makes me feel awful thinking back to all of those raw emotions but I was completely shocked.'

Two weeks after being born, Ellie was officially diagnosed.

But instead of dwelling on the condition, Ms Moden's family rallied round to support her through it.

Lisa said: 'It didn't take long for me to see past the diagnosis, Ellie's didn't seem to have poor muscle tone, she was lucky with very good health and went from strength to strength.

'Evie loved her little sister from the moment she saw her, she was no different in her eyes.

'It's refreshing to see and it's nice to think she'll always have a friend looking out for her when she starts school.'

As they girls have grown older, they spend more and more time together.

Ms Moden said: 'The girls love playing together 24/7.

Their parents say  Ellie learned to walk early because she wanted to keep up with her big sister

'If they aren't climbing up our furniture they are playing hide and seek.

'Both of them love dressing up as princesses too, they have a lovely fancy dress box which they're always playing in.

'We've only told Evie that her sister is 'special' the same as any sibling, but that she need may need extra help learning things but with the pace Ellie picks things up she's barely behind.'

Ellie now goes to nursery two days a week where she enjoys playing with new friends.

Ms Moden said: 'I was so terrified when I realised Ellie has Down's Syndrome but she is amazing.

'I wouldn't change her for the world, I'm so proud of both my girls.'

The family have been supported by Small Steps - a support group for children with Down's syndrome.

Alison Watson, Founder of the group, said: 'When my Freya, now six, was born with Down's syndrome, I set up Small Steps as I felt it was important to have a support network for parents such as myself.

'Lisa bought Ellie and Evie to Small Steps to learn sign language, play, explore and have fun among people who understand and can support any worries or concerns having a child with Down's Syndrome can bring.

'Evie's relationship with Ellie is very special, very close.

'Ellie learns so much from Evie and children with Down syndrome are generally very visual learners.

'We want people to know that having DS is certainly not the end of the world.

'It's all about taking Small Steps, and enjoying every one of them.'
