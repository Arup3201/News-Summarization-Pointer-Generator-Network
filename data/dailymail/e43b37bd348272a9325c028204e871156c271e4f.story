A  woman accused of murdering her newborn son waited 17 hours after the baby died before calling an ambulance and reporting her child stillborn, a court has heard.

Paramedics arrived to find the dead infant wrapped in a towel and lying on a washing machine at the Gold Coast home on June 8, the woman's bail hearing was told.

Jodie Tarnawskyj, 35, was denied bail in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday because she was deemed a flight risk.

Jodie Tarnawskyj, 35, was denied bail in Brisbane Supreme Court on Thursday accused of murdering her newborn son on Juna 8

The mother of two was arrested last week and charged with murdering her son on June 8.

The court was told Tarnawskyj had concealed her pregnancy from her partner and friends and tried to terminate the pregnancy twice.

Crown prosecutor Sandra Cupina said while pregnant the unemployed Tarnawskyj researched how to end a pregnancy and took drugs she knew were dangerous to the fetus.

On the evening of June 8, Tarnawskyj called the ambulance service on a non-emergency line and said her 30-week-old baby had been stillborn 17 hours earlier.

However, medical evidence indicated the baby was 40 weeks old - full term - and breathing when born, Ms Cupina said.

The pathologist's report hasn't been finalised but suggests the infant died shortly after birth.

No cause of death has been found, though the infant had bruising on his lips, internal neck bruising and indications of bleeding in the brain and swelling in the brain tissue, which could be a sign of oxygen deprivation, the court heard.

Ms Cupina said the injuries did not conclusively show the baby was intentionally harmed.

The Paradise Point woman waited 17 hours after the baby died before calling an ambulance and reporting her child stillborn, a court has heard 

When Tarnawskyj rang the ambulance she said she hadn't known she was pregnant when she 'felt the urge to push' and delivered the baby - blue and not breathing - in the toilet, according to prosecution evidence read out in court by Justice Peter Applegarth.

However, Ms Cupina said the former dietician had conducted internet searches about pregnancy and stillbirth and how someone could end a pregnancy.

Between her child's death and calling the ambulance Tarnawskyj picked up a cat from a friend and brought it back to her home at Paradise Point.

In April, Tarnawskyj told a doctor she had miscarried and the pregnancy hadn't been far along.

She also told a friend and her de facto she wasn't pregnant and had a blood clot.

'This conduct all points to one conclusion, which is that the applicant was going to be sure this baby was to die and she intended this baby to die,' Ms Cupina said.

Defence lawyer Angelo Vasta said there was no evidence Tarnawskyj killed or intended to kill her child and her 'bizarre' behaviour after its death could be put down to depression.

'This is no case of murder. At best it could be a case of manslaughter,' he told the court.

However, Justice Applegarth said there was a prospect Tarnawskyj could be convicted of either murder or manslaughter and she had a 'powerful incentive' not to appear at trial.

Tarnawskyj was not in court for the decision and remains behind bars.

Her case is due to be mentioned in the Southport Magistrates Court on February 2.
