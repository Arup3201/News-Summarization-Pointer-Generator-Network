Cannons from a British warship which sank while on its way to put down an Irish rebellion have been uncovered by the recent storms after two centuries buried in sand.

The two heavy iron guns have were hidden under the South Wales beach after a Navy troop ship was wrecked in a gale.

However, the recent storms have removed around two feet of sand revealing the weapons for the first time since the days of Napoleon.

Cannon find: The gun from a warship thought to have sunk off the Welsh coast in 1798 is held by Porthcawl museum chairman Paul Joseph

Find: The two cannons were discovered on the beach by dog walkers after storms removed two feet of sand at around the turn of the year

Spot: The cannons which had gone undiscovered for 200 years were found at Porthcawl, South Wales, shortly after the turn of the year

Two dog walkers spotted the tip of one of the cannons poking above the beach at the popular seaside resort of Porthcawl.

Marine historians were called in and believe they were from a ship on its way to put down an Irish rebellion.

Porthcawl museum chairman Paul Joseph said: 'It's an amazing find and but for the exceptional storms could have lain hidden there for another two centuries.

'We loaded the smallest three-foot long cannon onto a wheelbarrow to carry it to the local museum in the town centre.

'But it took 12 local lifeguards to lift the four-and-a-half foot cannon onto a trailer pulled by a quad bike.'

Restoration work: The cannons, being worked on here by archeologist Martin Little, are being kept in saltwater, then rainwater for several weeks before they will be treated with special chemicals to preserve them

Mr Joseph said the cannons could have come from a British vessel taking troops to Ireland in 1798 during a severe storm in the Bristol Channel.

The British government sent thousands of troops to Ireland to crush a major uprising against them led by the United Irishmen Republican group.

The French sent reinforcements to help the rebels - but never landed in Ireland after Atlantic storms forced them to retreat.

The two cannons are being kept in saltwater, then rainwater for several weeks before they will be treated with special chemicals to preserve them.

Mr Joseph added: 'The guns will be given pride of place in the museum and I'm sure will be a big attraction for visitors.'

The recent storms pummelled other beaches along the Welsh coastline uncovering a treasure trove of discoveries.

They included the remnants of a 10,000-year-old forest at Newgale, Pembrokeshire, and an an 1810 bathhouse at Aberystwyth.

Pembrokeshire Coast National Park heritage manager Phil Bennett said: 'The storms and high seas have scoured the sand exposing the remains of this woodland.

'We have been able to identify some recognisable timbers from the Mesolithic period about 11,600 years ago.

'This woodland area would have been visited by hunter gatherer bands from time to time.

'They would be looking for game and collecting edible plants, nuts and berries as they became available during the year.'
