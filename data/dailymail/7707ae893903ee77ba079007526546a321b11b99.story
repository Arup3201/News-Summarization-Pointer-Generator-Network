A British teacher who 'dramatically improved' a teenage schoolgirl's grades in exchange for nude photographs of her is being deported from the U.S.

Gawain Roberts, 36, who is originally from Swansea but was teaching in Colorado, also sent naked pictures of himself to the 16-year-old after talking to her on Facebook.

Married father-of-two Roberts was spared prison - on the condition that he will never be able to return to the state after being deported back to Britain.

Deported: Teacher Gawain Roberts, 36, originally from Swansea, is being deported from the U.S. after admitting sexual exploitation of a child

The teacher, from Swansea in South Wales, pleaded guilty to attempted sexual exploitation of a child as part of a plea bargain to get a six year suspended prison sentence.

Roberts was teaching troubled high school students in an alternative education programme in Loveland, Colorado, when he groomed the schoolgirl.

Prosecutor David Vandenberg told the court Roberts struck up a Facebook conversation with the girl last year, the content of which eventually became sexual.

Mr Vanderberg said that after Roberts convinced the girl to send him nude photos her school grades 'improved dramatically'.

He said: 'He basically offered to help her improve her grades if she would do certain things.

'The conversation goes on for a while but at some point it does turn sexual.

'She did send him six photographs. In return he sent nude photos of himself back to her.

'We were able to tell from the school's records that her grades improved dramatically.'

The court heard Roberts had been hired by the Thompson School District in 2006 after passing a background check.

He had been teaching a small group of high school students through an alternative education programme but resigned last year when the charges were filed against him.

Roberts agreed to plead guilty to attempted sexual exploitation of a child as part of a plea bargain to get six years in prison suspended.

He will face a separate deportation hearing but as part of his plea deal he is not allowed to fight it.

Roberts has two children with his American-born wife.

The plea bargain deal allows Roberts to to return to the UK without serving any jail time.

Mrs Roberts, who refused to reveal her first name, refused to accept that he exploited the girl.

She said: 'A teacher leveraging his power to get nude photos of students is horrifying."If he was truly doing what they say, why would they give him a deal that doesn't have any jail time? He is not the person they are saying he is.'
