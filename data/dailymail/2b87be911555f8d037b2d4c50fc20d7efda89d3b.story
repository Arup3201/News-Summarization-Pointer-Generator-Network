Adam Gemili insists Great Britain can challenge the sprinting powerhouses of Jamaica and the USA and win 4x100metre gold on the global stage.

The men's sprint relay team has struggled to get the baton round in recent championships, but the British women's quartet won world bronze last year and Gemili believes the exciting crop of current talent is capable of achieving even more.

The 20-year-old, one of nine British men to have dipped under 10.2secs for 100m already this season, said: 'Everyone in British sprinting is running ridiculously quick at the moment.

'If we get the four fastest guys in there with good hand-offs I don't see any reason why we can't challenge the Jamaicans and the Americans for a gold medal at the future championships.

'The Jamaicans have Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake, and the Americans have Justin Gatlin, but I think we can do it.'

Gemili, who will run in the relay at this weekend's European Team Championships in Germany, also revealed he plans to contest only the 200m at the Sainsbury's British Championships from June 27 to 29.

The 100m promises to be one of the highlights of the weekend, with the likes of sub-10 men James Dasaolu and Chijindu Ujah and world 60m indoor Richard Kilty vying for just three spots for August's European Championships, but Gemili said he is likely to concentrate on the longer sprint.

He said: 'At the trials and European Champs I'll probably do the 200m as I'm already selected for the 100m at the Commonwealth Games. It's a long season as there are only eight days between the Commonwealths and Europeans. If there was only championship I may have gone to double up.'
