To the untrained eye, Ross  Barkley seemed to have played incredibly well. He was slick in possession, exciting and unpredictable. He went past defenders and he created England’s second goal for Rickie Lambert.

So, it was a surprise when Roy Hodgson picked his performance apart. ‘He lost the ball an awful lot of times,’ said the manager. ‘If he’s going to be the player we want him to be, he has to make better decisions when he turns with the ball.

‘That’s not a criticism, but there were other performances out there who merited your obsession more than Ross Barkley. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones were outstanding, Jack Wilshere in the middle of the park, Rickie Lambert scored a magnificent goal. There always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player. I will be prepared to start any of the players in any game, but I’m not prepared to address the obsession with Ross Barkley.’

Hodgson seemingly has a determination to be contrary. On a night when England supporters arrived at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami  looking for signs of encouragement, the young Everton midfielder surely provided some.

The reaction from the boss seemed a harsh and prickly, like Glenn Hoddle trying to dilute the clamour for David Beckham in the build-up to France 98.

Barkley was starting his first England game and seemed to cope well for a 20-year-old preparing for his first major tournament. He left the stadium without a word, head down, flicking through messages on his phone, some of them surely from home in Merseyside, with their thoughts on the post-match comments of Hodgson.

Perhaps it was part of a misguided defence mechanism to protect Wayne Rooney, who had worked hard on the left wing and scored his first England goal since October.

Perhaps Hodgson feared it would fuel a campaign to start Barkley ahead of Rooney against Italy in Manaus on  Saturday week if he appeared excited by the attacking qualities of the young Everton midfielder, rather than seizing upon his errors.

Perhaps he wanted to keep him grounded. Perhaps he really does believe Barkley is far too casual in possession, picked the wrong options, and that this was the reason his team were so painfully vulnerable at the back.

Whatever the motive, Barkley can feel miffed. His pass completion rate was  91 per cent and he seemed to settle easily into the sleepy tempo of football in the tropical humidity. He injected a burst of pace when necessary and was willing to turn and take on defenders.

His assist for England’s second goal was uplifting as he drifted left to right and nutmegged one defender, lured others towards him and rolled in Rickie Lambert. He may not have always picked the right option, but here he did.

Worry: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury

Make way? Roy Hodgson might consider swapping Wayne Rooney for Barkley in the opener against Italy

Elsewhere, he offered a first-time pass or a well-balanced change of direction. He showed the poise and vision to open spaces for others and combined well with Lambert, exactly the sort of thing you would demand of your creator-in-chief.

Until he tired in the final 20 minutes, Barkley made things happen. So did Oxlade-Chamberlain until struck down by the injury which may end his hopes of World Cup participation.

Hodgson has always had a fondness for the Ox, having made him a surprise selection for Euro 2012 and stood by him through a serious knee injury last year and when a groin problem niggled away in April and May.

Like Barkley he can go past his man, although just as the deep midfielders did not shield their centre halves well, Oxlade-Chamberlain did little to help James Milner, who found it hard to adjust to his role at right back.

Slight criticism: Roy Hodgson said there were certain things Barkley could do to improve

There was little protection on display full stop. Frank Lampard and Wilshere, another desperate to stay fit and who limped off with cramp, are strong on the ball and prepared to tackle but do not naturally sense danger.

They were unable to smother Ecuador’s movement around the edge of the box, but they shifted the ball quickly and England flexed well on the turnover of possession, especially when they funnelled through Barkley.

To the untrained eye, that’s how it seemed: vulnerable at the back, encouraging going forward and  Barkley was a delight to watch.
