Beyond: Two Souls is a lacklustre videogame. But it’s still an entertaining, if flawed, interactive movie.

For what it lacks in gameplay, it makes up for in (mostly) wonderful cinematography, action-packed (if sometimes over-the-top) set pieces, and a mesmerising performance from Ellen Page.

Written and directed by David Cage – the man who penned the acclaimed Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit – you ‘play’ Jody Holmes (Page), a girl possessed by a spirit she calls Aiden, who has a variety of powers at his disposal.

Enjoyable: there are plenty of plot holes and Cage's writing is heavy-handed at times, but Beyond still entertains

Plot bounces back and forward in time uncomfortably. One minute you're reliving key events from Jody’s upbringing - and her relationship with Dr Nathan Dawkins (voiced by Willem Defoe). The next you're at the centre of an all-action, Jason Bourne-inspired chase scene.

Thankfully, for what Beyond lacks in coherent plot, it makes up for by Page’s performance. At its heart, the game revolves around Jody’s relationship with Aiden – and it is the earlier, quieter sequences (especially a party scene), that are both the most memorable and the most effective at driving the interplay between the two home.

Interestingly, it’s during these moments that the lack of any real gameplay doesn’t seem to matter as much.

As in Heavy Rain, player interaction is reduced to button prompts and manipulating the sticks to mimic an on-screen movement. Sadly, this system is just too passive for the game’s more action-orientated scenes.

Quick-Time Events are incredibly rigid, and often have the same outcome if no buttons are pressed. The ability to use Aiden is also far too scripted. He’s not available all the time, and can only possess certain souls.

Indeed, it forces you down a certain path with such uncompromising force that it reaffirms suggestions that Cage may be a frustrated movie director at heart.

Flawed: during the Quick Time events, often doing nothing will not really affect the outcome

Although there are multiple endings, all of Jody’s choices feel insignificant compared to the life or death decisions in Heavy Rain. Environments, although technically masterful, are all smoke and mirrors – offering very little depth in exploration, bar the odd object to pick up and examine.

Facial animations are wonderful, though, detailed enough to depict even the most intricate of emotions.

Go into Beyond as an experience, not a game, and you’ll enjoy the ride. But be warned… it’s a bumpy one.

Beyond: Two Souls is out Friday October 11.

Stunning overall presentation, especially in the facial animation

Brilliant performance from Ellen Page but some heavy-handed writing

You don't really 'play' it, rather twiddle the odd button now and then

Extremely linear and Aiden power is under-developed
