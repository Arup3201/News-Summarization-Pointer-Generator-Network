Brazil captain Thiago Silva has come up with a novel way of limiting the impact of Argentina star Lionel Messi at the World Cup - drawing a gun on him.

‘The only way of stopping Messi is with a gun,’ said the Paris Saint-Germain defender, in an interview with Brazil sports magazine Placar.

‘He is the attacker who keeps you awake when you play against him. I faced him three times with AC Milan and once with PSG. When the game goes to one side of the field, he is alone on the other.

‘Despite recent injuries, he is a guy who will work very hard at the World Cup.’

Silva, who has 46 international caps for Brazil, said he would love for the hosts to face Argentina, Germany or Spain in the final at the Maracana on July 13.

‘Argentina would be a classic. Or Germany, for a rematch of the 2002 World Cup final. Or Spain, since the Spanish are also calling for a rematch after we beat them in the Confederations Cup final last year. Sergio Ramos said the story would be different at the World Cup.’

When asked how a rematch with Spain might end differently, he said: ‘Suddenly Brazil only win 1-0, right?’

The centre-back also spoke about his move from AC Milan to Paris Saint-Germain and how his dream as a youngster was to one day play for Barcelona.

‘When I arrived in Milan, I thought I would end my career there, or at least play some 10 years there and then finish in Brazil.

'For me, I had reached the peak of my career. Then came the great offer from Paris Saint-Germain.

Happy: The Brazil players seemed to be in good spirits during a training session

‘I have spoken to Barcelona, including last year when I was at Paris Saint-Germain. But there was never a concrete offer of a contract for me to sign.

‘My dream was to play for Barcelona. When I was little I wanted to be like the striker Romario. I started as a striker but then moved to defence.

'When Romario played at Barcelona I started to have the dream of playing for the club. But today I can say that is no longer my dream. That is in the past.’
