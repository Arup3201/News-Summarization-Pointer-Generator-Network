With its palatial interior, grand Elizabethan features and rustic views over the Malvern Hills, Sabina Carter’s £1.25million apartment was the embodiment of good taste and propriety.

Unfortunately, the same could not quite be said for its owner.  

For after an unseemly row with a wealthy neighbour in the 17th century stately home, Carter sent her an email telling her to ‘go hang yourself’.

Evicted: Sabina Carter was thrown out of the 17th century Westwood House after she sent a 'disturbing and distressing' email to the head of the residents' committee. This photograph was taken in 2009

The
 50-year-old divorcee composed the message to residents’ committee 
chairman Janice Brookes after defaulting by £11,000 on service charges 
for the upkeep of the grounds and Grade I-listed building, a court 
heard.

The imposing Westwood
 House, nestled in the rolling countryside near Droitwich in 
Worcestershire, is split into 12 luxury flats and all residents have to 
pay monthly service charges.

Prosecutor
 Jackie Rogers said Carter, who was made bankrupt in 2010, struggled to 
get on with neighbours, had been taken to court by the residents’ 
committee over the money she owed and was given a harassment warning in 
September 2012 ordering her to have no contact with Mrs Brookes.

But
 in November last year, the former Lufthansa air hostess sent Mrs 
Brookes, a jeweller, an obscene email, including the line: ‘My only 
other suggestion is that you go and hang yourself but with your own low 
IQ you couldn’t manage that either.’

Luxury: The property, which includes an Elizabethan salon with 24ft-high ceilings, a kitchen and two bedrooms, was put on the market for £1.25million, but it has struggled to sell

Mother-of-two
 Carter pleaded guilty to sending an email that was grossly offensive or
 of an indecent, obscene or menacing character at Worcester Magistrates’
 Court on Wednesday.

In a 
victim impact statement, Mrs Brookes, 48, said she found the email 
‘distressing and disgusting’. Carter was given a  12-month conditional 
discharge and ordered to pay £250  compensation to Mrs Brookes, as well 
as £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Paul
 Nicholls, defending,  said that Carter had been  ‘under strain’ and was
 being evicted for defaulting on her mortgage repayments.

He added: ‘It is not a nice email. She wrote as a 15-year-old rather than a 50-year-old. Things have settled down now.’

Carter’s eviction marks the end of her dream of living in the opulent surroundings Westwood House has to offer.

Approached
 via a three-quarter-of-a-mile private drive, it was built by the 
Packington family, who rose from obscurity – along with many English 
Protestant families – under Henry VIII.

When
 Carter bought her two-bedroom, 3,000 sq ft flat for £237,000 in 1999, 
it was dilapidated and run-down, and she poured thousands of pounds into
 restoring it.

Disputes: Prosecutor Jackie Rogers told Worcester Magistrates' Court that Carter struggled to get on with neighbours at the 17th century mansion

But it 
already boasted many impressive features, including an Elizabethan salon
 with 24ft-high ceilings and massive original fireplace. The plaster 
decoration on the wall dates from Elizabeth I’s reign, while the ceiling
 itself was a gift from Charles II in recognition of the Packington 
family’s loyalty throughout the Civil War.

But
 Carter began to struggle to keep up with the running costs of the flat,
 which came to around £4,000 a year, including £120-a-month service 
charges and £2,000 council tax.

She
 put the flat on the market for £1.25million in 2009. In an interview 
with the Mail on Sunday at the time, Carter, who makes her living 
selling English luxury goods to supermarkets in her native Germany, 
said: ‘I want the money. And I want to downsize to somewhere more cosy 
and less grand.’

The 
interview was accompanied by a photograph of her perched on a white sofa
 in the spectacular salon with her young children.

However, she failed to find a buyer, and was forced to remortgage the property until she was made bankrupt.

Yesterday, neighbours said they were relieved Carter had gone.

Budget: Carter bought the dilapidated apartment for just £237,000 in 1999 when she came to Worcestershire to buy up high-end businesses which she then sold back to wealthy Germans

One
 said: ‘She was a nightmare. People living here have a certain 
expectation of lifestyle and she couldn’t accept that her personal 
circumstances meant she was living beyond her means.

‘It
 was a sad way to end her time here but it’s not right to lash out at 
fellow neighbours just because they ask for money which is rightly 
owed.’

Jacqueline Pointon, 
69, who has lived in the house since 1953 when her father bought one of 
the first apartments, said: ‘People are relieved she has finally gone. 
The flat is empty now.’

And another former neighbour said the other residents may even celebrate Carter’s departure with a party.

She
 said: ‘We are mightily relieved and we will no doubt be having a little
 farewell party in her honour – which she most certainly is not invited 
to.’

Carter now plans to move back to Germany where her mother is undergoing chemotherapy, the court heard.

Mrs Brookes was on holiday in Barbados yesterday and unavailable for comment.
