David Beckham was famed for his ability to strike a ball with his right foot and it seems son Brooklyn has been blessed with similar talent.

The 15-year-old signed for Arsenal's youth team late last year and looks to have ability in abundance judging by footage the youngster shared via his Instagram account on Tuesday.

Wearing the No 15 shirt, Brooklyn makes a forward run into the box before controlling a bouncing ball from the right. Beckham Jnr then allows the ball to fall across his body before unleashing a powerful half-volley with his right peg which the opposition goalkeeper does well to tip onto the bar.

The teen, who previously had trials with Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester United and Queens Parks Rangers, was first reported to have signed a short-term deal with Arsenal back in November.

Beckham's eldest son was said to have impressed several clubs, but decided to go with the Gunners, the club he supports.

Brooklyn's striking technique was reminiscent of a goal scored by his father David for Manchester United against Tottenham at Old Trafford in May 1999.

Also taking the ball on the right, Beckham lashed the ball home from inside the area to help secure the title for Red Devils during the club's treble winning season.
