A woman died in a freak riding accident after her horse fell and landed on top of her during an event and crushed her to death.

Sally Amy had been competing in a 90cm show-jumping class at 2pm on Saturday riding her horse Tomadatchi, who was also known as Treacle.

According to witnesses, the horse slipped while attempting a jump and landed on top of the 56-year-old.

The horrific accident happened in St Lawrence, Jersey, where Mrs Amy was crushed by her horse

Although spectators, fellow competitors, the police and ambulance services rushed to help the mother-of-one she died died.

Mrs Amy was taking part in an annual show when her mount, Treacle, slipped while making a jump, clipped the top pole and fell on top of her.

Tributes poured in for Mrs Amy, from St Brelade, Jersey, a popular and valued member of the island's equestrian community.

The Jersey Riding Club, which had organised the competition, paid tribute to the popular and experienced rider who had been a member of the club for a number of years.

In a statement, the club said: 'The members of the Jersey Riding Club are deeply saddened by this tragic accident.

'Sally was a popular and valued member of our club and our thoughts and sympathy are with her family at this sad time.'

Angela Mitchel, chairman of the local branch of the British Show Jumping Association, announced that a minute's silence would be observed for Mrs Amy at the Liberation Day Horse Show on May 9.

She said: 'Sally was a wonderful person and a great supporter of all horse activities in the Island.

'We are all really shocked and thinking of her family at this sad time.'

Mrs Amy, who worked as a trust manager at the same company for more than 20 years, died whilst competing in the Jersey Riding Club Annual Show, in St Lawrence.

The police confirmed they were treating the death of the keen tennis player as an accident.

Mrs Amy's ex-husband Trevor Amy died in 2009 after falling from a flight of stairs at the Rozel Bay Bar, where he was landlord.
