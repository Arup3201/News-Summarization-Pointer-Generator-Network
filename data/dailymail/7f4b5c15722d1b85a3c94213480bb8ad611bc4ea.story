A man who shot his parents when he was a teenager has revealed he felt 'like a zombie' on the night of the murder as he called for assault weapons to be banned.

Joshua Cooke was 19 when he shot dead his parents at their Fairfax, Virginia home in 2003.

'If I had an assault weapon, things would have been much worse,' Cooke told Piers Morgan Live from his prison cell.

'I thank God I didn't have an AR-15 or 
some other type of assault weapon because the way I was back then 
mentally, I would have gone to the mall that night or to one of my old 
high schools the next morning and killed as many people as I possibly 
could,' he said.

Cooke, who is serving a 40-year sentence, said on the day of the murder he had a lot of anger for his adopted parents, who had looked after him and his sister since he was 5, and 'wanted my life, as I knew it back then, to end.'

After helping 51-year-old Paul Cooke, 
and his wife, Margaret, 56, shovel snow off their drive in February 
2003, Cooke played violent video games in his bedroom.

He then picked up a
shotgun, looked at his poster for the Matrix film, and decided: 'That
was it, there was nothing left in my life'.

He told Morgan: 'I wanted to end my life and theirs.'

In a detached voice, Cooke recalled walking downstairs and shooting his mother in the chest as she turned towards him from her computer. 

His father, who had been on the phone
to Cooke's sister at the time, tried to take cover under the desk but 
Cooke fired at him several times, according to the Collegiate Times.

He said: 'I had no emotion at all. I was basically like a zombie. I went down the steps and I shot my mother.'

'I was numb. There had been so many years
of hurt from mother's abuse and bullying, rejection from girls, all 
types of things like that, I just - I didn't care about anything 
anymore.'

He went back upstairs to reload the 
weapon and as he came back down his mother confronted him, clasping her 
chest and saying: 'What are you doing Joshua? Why did you do this?'

Cooke said: 'I loaded the gun, I pointed it at her 
face and I shot her in the face. I walked down the steps, I stepped over
her body and I shot my father in the head one more time.'

He told Morgan he then had a coke in his room while he waited for police to arrive. 

Cooke had bought the gun he used in the 
killing from a sports store two days before. He said  because he didn't 
have an assault weapon he was prevented from going on to harm anyone else.

'I thank God I didn't have one of those things, and the gun does matter,' he added.

Cooke, who is serving 40 years for the double murder, reached out to people who may be experiencing the same dark thoughts he had, urging them to seek help.

'I've been where you are ... you don't know the pain you'll cause,' he said.
