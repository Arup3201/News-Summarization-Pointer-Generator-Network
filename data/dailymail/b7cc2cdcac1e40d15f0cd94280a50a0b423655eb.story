A University of Houston senior who claims married
Texans star Arian Foster pressured her into getting an abortion after finding out she was pregnant with his baby has been forced to stand by her story after denying the claims in a recorded phone call.

Brittany
 Norwood, 20, apparently recanted her story as she spoke to Foster just days after she filed a lawsuit suing him for child support and emotional distress, and demanded a restraining order.

'I never once said that you told me to get an abortion,' Norwood says on the audio. 'I was never in fear of my life around you. Like, I didn't (expletive) need a restraining order.

'I love you and you're still the father 
of my child,' she continued, according to KHOU. 'You think I'm going to let anybody, like, desecrate your 
name - especially if my baby has Foster tagged to it?'

Insistent: Brittany Norwood, who says she is pregnant with a married Houston Texans player, has stood by her story after recordings emerged of her denying the claims in a phone conversation

But now, in an interview with KHOU, Norwood has stood by her initial claims. But she has conceding that, although Foster pressured her, he never used the word 'abortion'.

'I don't take back anything I’ve ever 
said,' she said. 'I've been through a lot. I have. But I'm staying 
strong, and I'm going to be a great mother.'

Norwood’s attorney, Doug York, confirmed
 that she did make the statements in the recording. He said she was just
 trying to calm the waters with her ex-boyfriend ahead of the trial.

Norwood says she started dating Foster about a year ago and fell 
in love with him without ever knowing he had a wife and two children.

No idea: According to Norwood, she didn't know 
that Foster was married during the year they dated. On the right, Foster

When she got pregnant, she says Foster and members of his family started harassing her about an abortion.

'He's
 like, "You can't have this, you can’t have this kid, like, we cannot 
bring a child into this, like, think about my kids,"' Norwood told KHOU.

Foster also allegedly pushed the abortion issue in a series of text messages.

'You
 just can't bring a life into this world under these circumstances. It's
 not fair to anyone. It's not just about you,' one message read, 
according to Norwood.

Norwood says that Foster has 
refused to help her with medical bills, forcing her to to go on medicaid
 despite his 'vast financial resources'.

In the lawsuit, Norwood said she wants Foster to submit to DNA testing to prove his paternity so he can pay child support.

Support: Norwood's mother, Danna Sellers, said the two plan to feature in a reality TV show about hot mothers and daughters - and insisted the show would have nothing to do with Foster's baby

Norwood
 is seeking damages because his behavior pushing for an abortion caused 
her to 'suffer severe emotional distress'. She also wants a restraining 
order against Foster.

In
 response to the lawsuit, Foster filed for a gag order to be placed on 
Norwood who he says is planning to star in a reality show about being 
pregnant with his child.

Norwood
 acknowledged that she was due to film a reality show called the 
'Blondashian' but that it was never supposed to be about her pregnancy 
with Foster's child.

She says the show was going to be focused on hot moms and their hot daughters, and she planned to shoot it with her mother.

There's still a possibility the reality show could happen, she said.

Quiet: Foster (left) countered Norwood's lawsuit with a gag order, but was unsuccessful

On Tuesday, a judge signed an order forbidding either party from harassing each other but would not OK the gag order.

Despite the counter gag-order, Foster has remained mum on the issue and his attorney has refused to comment.

Norwood was approximately 17 weeks pregnant when she filed the suit and her son is due in June.

'It's hard going to ultra-sounds and not having somebody there with you,' she said. 'I want him to love my son the way I do.'
