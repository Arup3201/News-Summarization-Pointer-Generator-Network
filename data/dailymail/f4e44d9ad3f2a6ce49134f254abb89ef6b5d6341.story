A dangerous combination of alcohol and gravity played a cruel joke on a Maine artist who fell out of a second-floor window after accidentally breaking into a flower shop while trying to prank a friend.

Ronald Podlaski, 29, who goes by the moniker RookSye in Portland's art circles, said he was trying to surprise a friend Saturday by sneaking into her apartment via the fire escape.

But unfortunately for Podlaski, who admittedly came up with the stunt after downing a few too many beers, he got the wrong building.

Harebrained prank: Ronald Podlaski, 29, who goes by the moniker RookSye, was arrested Saturday after he accidentally broke into a Portland, Maine, flower shop thinking it was his friend's home 

Instead of climbing into the apartment of Cara Taggersell, which she shares with her fiance, Podlaski found himself in the middle of Harmon's & Barton's flower shop on Congress Street Saturday night.

After realizing his mistake, and getting tangled in some plants, the hapless 29-year-old tripped the alarm and fell from a second-floor window,Portland Press-Herald reported. 

When Podlaski came to, he found himself lying on the pavement with a pair of Portland police officers staring down at him.

The artist suffered a broken wrist and was hauled off to jail, but prosecutors have decided to let him off the hook after concluding that he has learned his lesson.

Podlaski has acknowledged that the nighttime escapade was a 'foolish' idea, and he now plans to apologize to the owner of the flower shop for the unwelcome visit. 

In an ironic twist, even if Podlaski got the right building that night, his grand gesture would have been in vain because his friend, a fencing referee, was away that week working at an international competition in El Salvador.

Ironic: Podlaski was hoping to surprise his friend and former roommate, Cara Taggersell (left and right), but unbeknownst to him she was in El Salvador at the time 

Portland police were dispatched to the flower shop at 584 Congress Street at around 10pm Saturday after receiving an alert indicating a possible break-in.

Ron Podlaski/RookSye was picked up, literally, and jailed on charges of burglary, criminal mischief and theft.

The theft count was tacked on after police spotted a candelabra hanging from the fire escape.

They said the 29-year-old plummeted two stories while trying to use the fire escape as a getaway route.

The 29-year-old aspiring tattoo artist said that the ill-conceived stunt was exacerbated by an unfortunate miscalculation on his part, which brought him two buildings down from where his friend Cara lives.

After climbing two flights of fire-escape stairs to the third floor of 584 Congress Street, he snuck into the attic and then descended down to the second floor, where his error became immediately apparent.

Instead of encountering the familiar interior of his friend's apartment, he saw mannequins used by the florist in window displays.

Podlaski tried to beat a hasty retreat, but on his way downstairs he tripped the burglar alarm.

Series of unfortunate events: Podlaski climbed the fire escape to the attic at 584 Congress Street in Portland, descended to the second floor and only then he realized that he broke into Harmon's and Barton's flower shop  

Two peas in a pod: Podlaski and Taggersell had been roommates at one time, and according to the woman, it is not uncommon for him to hurl pebbles at the windows to draw her attention 

Desperate to escape, Podlaski tried to climb out the window but stumbled and fell, landing on the sidewalk below where he was collared by police.

Mr Podlaski was released from Cumberland County Jail Monday after spending the weekend cooling his heels in a cell.

When Cara Taggersell heard of her friend's misadventure, she was not surprised.

‘He’s always up for a good time. Sometimes he might lack common sense about some things,’ she told the paper.

The fencing referee said it was not uncommon for Podlaski, her former roommate, to hurl stones at their windows to draw her and her fiance's attention.

Podlaski insisted that he was not a bad person, but rather a 'foolish young man who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
