Almost 6,000 buildings and historic sites are at risk of being lost, English Heritage has revealed.

The latest Heritage at Risk register revealed that 5,831 listed buildings, monuments, archaeological sites, battlefields, shipwrecks, places of worship, conservation areas and landscapes in England are under threat from neglect, decay and damage.

The figure includes heritage sites with the highest levels of protection, Grade I and II* listing, across the country but those with the lower Grade II listing have only been included in London.

A terrible loss: Grade I listed The Crescent, Buxton, High Peak, Derbyshire

At death's door: Grade II Frank James Memorial Hospital on the Isle of Wight

Curtain call: Grade II* listed Torbay Cinema in Paignton, Devon, which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose-built cinema

English Heritage also announced a 
programme to assess England’s 345,000 Grade II listed buildings, funding
between nine and 15 pilot surveys with local authorities and other 
groups to find out which such structures are at risk.

Grade II sites already known to be at risk include an 18th century windmill in west Lancashire, an Edwardian lido for women in Reading and the dramatic front portico of a Victorian Methodist Sunday school in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.

This year’s register shows that 318 Grade I and II* buildings and sites have been saved and are no longer at risk but 360 heritage structures and places have been added.

With just 13 per cent of those on the list considered to be economic to repair, English Heritage’s director of heritage protection Dr Edward Impey said that in the current climate, efforts to save buildings may have to focus on 'holding' measures.

Lost and Foundry: Grade II Harvey's Foundry in Cornwall

Scrubs up nicely: Kings Meadow Baths in Reading, Berkshire

Boarded up: Wade Heath Pottery Works, Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, is a Grade II building at risk

Buildings could be saved with innovative schemes by people to find ways to preserve and find new use for structures, he said, adding 'there has never been a time when imagination and commitment has been more important'.

Other examples of heritage at risk are Grade II* listed Torbay Cinema in Paignton, Devon, which was licensed in 1912 and is a very well preserved example of an early purpose-built cinema but has been vacant for 10 years.

Margate’s Grade II* Dreamland rollercoaster was built in 1919-20 but was badly damaged by fire in 2008 and is on the heritage at risk list.

There are plans, supported by English 
Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, to breathe new life into the 
Dreamland amusement park and scenic railway in the Kent seaside town, 
and it is hoped the site has a future off the at-risk register.

Britain’s first atomic bomb store on Thetford Heath, Barnham, Suffolk, a Grade II* scheduled monument, has been added to the at-risk register.

From the mid-1960s onwards, the site’s watchtowers were vandalised and they and the 66 kiosks used for storing nuclear components fell into disrepair.

English Heritage said it has worked with the owners to help refurbish the five watch towers and carry out restoration, but much more needs to be done.

Simon Thurley, chief executive of 
English Heritage, said: 'We launched a first-ever Buildings at Risk 
register in 1998. We have expanded it over the years to include 
archaeology, monuments, gardens, conservation areas, places of worship, 
wrecks and battlefields.

'Now with the economic climate putting more pressure than ever on Grade II buildings, it’s time to plug the one remaining gap.'

English Heritage said Grade II buildings account for 92 per cent of all listed buildings and include houses, shops, inns, offices, schools, town halls, libraries, farms and mills which make up the character of England’s towns and country.

Dr Thurley said: 'Grade II buildings are the bulk of the nation’s heritage treasury. When one of them is lost, it’s as though someone has rubbed out a bit of the past; something that made your street or your village special will have gone.'

The number of Grade II listed buildings is not large in relation to all the buildings in England but it is too many for English Heritage to survey on its own, he said.

The heritage body is funding the pilot surveys to work with local people to find out what historic buildings and sites most need scarce resources.
