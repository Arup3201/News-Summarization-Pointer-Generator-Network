A pensioner was told she could not send her Christmas cards at a Post Office – because they were too small.

Staff refused to accept 79-year-old Yvonne Veakins' charity cards, which measure 3½in x 3½in and 3½in x 5in, claiming they might get lost in the mail system.

Instead Mrs Veakins, a former mayoress who previously worked in the British Embassy in Kenya, was told she could risk posting the cards herself using the postbox over the road.

Royal Mail has now apologised for the incident at the Thirsk Post Office in North Yorkshire, confirming there is no minimum size for domestic letters.

Mrs Veakins, who has 16 grandchildren, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing as it would be the same person who would be picking up the bag of letters that was behind the counter and emptying the postbox.

'I thought, if they are giving me stamps for the cards, doesn't that show they are accepting  responsibility for them?'

A spokesman for the Post Office initially said he believed the cards had not been accepted by the counter staff as Royal Mail had a minimum size of letter they could accept as they could get lost in the sorting machines.

But the Royal Mail dismissed this suggestion, saying if a card was too small for its sorting machines, staff would sort them by hand.

A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: ''We take on thousands of staff at this time of year for that very reason. 

'We would like to apologise for any confusion. This was caused by a miscommunication and we are happy to confirm that there is no minimum size for domestic letters.'
