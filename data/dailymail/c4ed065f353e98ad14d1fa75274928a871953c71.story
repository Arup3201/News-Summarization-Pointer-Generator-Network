Cardiff City have suffered a significant setback with influential chairman Mehmet Dalman preparing to resign from his role at the club.

Sportsmail can reveal the Turkish-Cypriot is planning to leave in order to concentrate on his other substantial business commitments, which include finance and the mining industry.

There has been no suggestion of a fall-out with owner Vincent Tan, though the development will cause concern for Cardiff supporters.

Dalman has been a stabilising figure 
at the club in a period of chaos, largely owing to the positive 
influence he is believed to hold on Tan, who entrusted him with the 
selection and appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Malky Mackay's 
replacement in January.

He
 drew repeated praise from Mackay for his attempts to broker peace 
between the Scot and Tan, while he is also credited with creating a 
proper boardroom structure at the club. He made the stunning claim 
earlier this year that the club's board members had never met each other
 prior to his arrival.

Dalman,
 who joined the Cardiff board in January 2012, had initially taken the 
role of chairman in July 2013 with the intention of dedicating a couple 
of days a week to the position.

But such has been the chaos of the club's season, it has proved to be a far more time-consuming role.

A source close to Dalman told Sportsmail a
 definitive decision has not been made.

News that Dalman will leave comes at a time when Tan is apparently keen to build bridges with Cardiff's support.

The
 Malaysian billionaire indicated last week that he was willing to 
consider a return to a blue kit, but his comments that only £50million of the £150m he has pumped into the club will be converted to equity have caused concern.

Tan previously promised to convert all the debt owed to him to equity.
