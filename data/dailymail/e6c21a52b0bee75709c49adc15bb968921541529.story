Posing with the British ambassador, Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn receives a prize which would send him to England to work at a top technology firm.

Three months after arriving, the 25-year-old was yesterday charged with killing a Muslim grandfather and was being questioned on suspicion of bombing three mosques.

As his university professor father spoke of the family’s shock at hearing the allegations, pictures emerged of Lapshyn a year ago.

In a ceremony at the official  Kiev residence of then ambassador Leigh Turner, Lapshyn was  presented with third prize for his work as a PhD student at the National Metallurgical Academy of Ukraine.

Stabbed in the back: Mohammed Saleem, 75

Dressed in a suit and pink tie, the student showed little emotion as he posed for a photograph.

Also present were university representative Michail Chubenko, his tutor Viktor Laskin and Delcam director Hugh Humphreys OBE.

Lapshyn was offered the chance to work for Delcam in Birmingham, which started in April.

There he met Denis Negreba, 22, another Ukrainian student, who was also arrested for terror offences before being released without charge on Sunday night.

Negreba is now expected to act as a witness in any prosecution faced by his friend, known as Pasha.

Speaking from his home town Dnipropetrovsk, 250 miles south of Ukraine’s capital, Lapshyn’s father said: ‘My son went for an internship as a programmer and at the same time he needed to work in mechanical engineering in Britain. I am in shock and I hope it is a mistake.’

His mother Galina, who almost died in a recent car accident, said: ‘I have a very good son, he has two honours degrees.’ His tutor, Mr Laskin, added: ‘He is shy and a quiet guy. He didn’t have any conflicts. He couldn’t defend himself. It is b*******.’

Grandfather Mohammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three times and stamped on as he returned from evening prayers three months ago.

Three mosques across the West Midlands have also been bombed in the past few weeks.

The two Ukrainian students were 
initially held last week by detectives investigating the explosions 
before Lapshyn was also arrested in relation to ‘a further act of 
terrorism’, on suspicion of the murder of Mr Saleem.

Mr Saleem’s daughter, Shazia Khan, 45, said: ‘It was an act of terrorism because he was killed for his faith.’

His widow Said, 69, who was married to him for 50 years, said what happened to him was ‘so wrong’.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office 
said: ‘British ambassadors meet thousands of people every week as part 
of their official duties.’

Lapshyn is due to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court this morning.
