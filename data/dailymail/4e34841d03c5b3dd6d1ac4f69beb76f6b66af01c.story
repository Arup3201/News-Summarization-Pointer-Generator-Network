Stand-out shoes: Elaine Paige pictured in 1978

It was a role that catapulted her to stardom but Elaine Paige has revealed it was not her voice alone that helped her secure the part of Eva Peron.

The singer and actress has confessed it was her ‘hooker’ shoes that paved the way for her to be chosen to play Evita in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical.

She auditioned for the lead role 13 times and made sure she wore the same heeled shoes complete with an ankle strap in green each time.

After Miss Paige won the part she was told by Harold Prince, the US theatre producer of the show: ‘I always remembered you. Every time you walked on, I saw those shoes. Like, here she comes, here come the f*** me shoes’.

The multi-millionaire composer’s 1978 show proved to be a breakthrough for Miss Paige who was 30 at the time and saw her billed as ‘the first lady of British musical theatre’.

She went on to win roles in Cats, Sunset Boulevard, Chess and The King and I.

Success however was not easy for Miss Paige, tired of the endless round of auditions and rejections, a year before she landed Evita, Miss Paige had toyed with the idea of giving up her career as an actress and retraining as a nursery nurse.

Sharing her secrets with musical theatre students at the Haymarket in London earlier this week, Miss Paige, 65, told them it was important to standout and to be determined: ‘I have spent my life going to auditions and there always a million other people going for the same role.

‘You can be the most talented person in the world but if you have not anything about you or the way you walk on, something distinctive then you won’t stand out.

‘When I first auditioned for Evita, and I must have had about 12 auditions after that, I wore the same 1940s’ frock and the same ‘hooker’ shoes with an ankle strap in green.

'I wore a pale blue skirt and green shoes. Every time I went back I wore the same thing. After I got the part Harold Prince (US theatre producer) said to me, “I always remembered you. Every time you walked on I saw those shoes. Like, here she comes, here come the f*** me shoes”.

‘Talent is not enough so my shoes helped.

‘Theatre is a young man’s game, you have got to have loads of energy, vitality and stamina to play eight shows a week. And the same with the auditions, you have to have to have a definite reason to be there.’

Miss Paige not only made headlines for her performances in Evita but also for her public affair with the musical’s lyricist Tim Rice.

It lasted for 11 years and they were openly a couple, even though Rice was married to Jane McIntosh, the daughter of an Army colonel and had two children.

And it is not just fledgling performers who have benefited from Miss Paige’s wealth of experience.

The star revealed she has also passed on tips to Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren who is currently starring in a play about The Queen called the Audience in London’s West End.

She said: ‘After the performance she told me that she felt as if her voice was being strained and I said to her “I suppose you are remembering to breathe?”

'And she just went “Oh”. I think because she has done to much film work that she is not used to projecting her voice. I think she had forgotten to breathe properly and you do have to do that.

‘I have got a stomach like a boxers because I have practiced and practiced it. It is very firm.

‘I went to go and see the new West End show Once The Musical last week.

‘It was a wonderful show but I could not understand a word they were on about. It is all about the importance of speaking. Projection and diction are important.’

Miss Paige attended the Aida Foster stage school, making her first professional appearance on stage in 1964, at the age of 16.

In 1985, she released “I Know him so well with Barbara Dickson from the musical Chess, which it is understood remains the biggest-selling record by a female duo.
