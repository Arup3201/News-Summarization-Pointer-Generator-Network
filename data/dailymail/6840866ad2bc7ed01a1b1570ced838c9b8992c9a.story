Olivier Giroud is set to make his long-awaited come back from injury in the crunch clash against Manchester United.

And manager Arsene Wenger has designs on pairing the Frenchman with £15million striker Danny Welbeck to form a potentially prolific strikeforce in the not too distant future.

Giroud has missed three month after sustaining a freak ankle injury in the 2-2 draw against Everton at the end of September.

That 2-2 draw with Everton back in August was the last time the France striker appeared in an Arsenal shirt

But, as Sportsmail revealed last week, the striker is set to be named in Arsenal's squad to face Louis van Gaal's men at the Emirates Stadium.

'He (Giroud) is three or four weeks ahead of schedule. Originally we planned to have him back for competition at the beginning of next year, so he is one month ahead.

'We relied on Welbeck, and on Alexis Sanchez as well, but we have Giroud back, we have Theo Walcott back.

'Slowly they will integrate into the team again and give us different options.'

Giroud's return poses a selection dilemma for Wenger given he plays with a lone striker, theoretically meaning he could be forced to choose between Welbeck and Giroud on match days.

The pair have trained with each other just twice due to Giroud's long-term injury.

And Wenger is keen to analyse how the pair gel as a conventional strike pairing in training, feeling it is a tactic that could be benefit his side this season.

However, Welbeck is expected to start as the lone striker against the club he left on transfer deadline day, with Giroud on the bench.

Wenger has also revealed Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Laurent Koscielny (achilles) will make their returns next month.

'Koscielny and Debuchy are doing well, they are out on the field [working] again. We have to see now,' said the Arsenal boss.

'Usually field work is three weeks away from full group training, then there is fitness. It looks straightforward for Debuchy. It's not inflammation, it's just repairing surgery.
