For a nation conscious of limited resources like Sweden, investing in 'eco' product development seems a fail-safe business strategy.

It worked for Ikea.

Now luxury intimate lifestyle company LELO has looked to its Swedish roots and is marketing a flat-pack, fully recycled vibrator promising to 'take the meaning of do-it-yourself pleasure to a whole new level'.

The LELO logo has been adapted to spookily replicate the IKEA logo, fitting with this campaign

The GӒSM, LELO's 'Cleanest, Greenest Vibe', is apparently made from 100% recycled materials, including compressed wood pulp and recycled rubber, and comes in a lush shade of forest green.

The GӒSM, worth £120, requires you to charge it by hand rotation (Allen key included) and even assemble from scratch - as it arrives in an 8-piece set.

Apparently, this is to 'allow you to 
take pride in piecing together your pleasure' and 'the money saved on 
production costs goes directly to you'.

A video on the company's website demonstrates how to assemble the eco-friendly 'personal massager' but bafflingly there are no options to actually buy the thing until April 1st.

Is someone yanking our crank?

LELO normally sell luxury vibes worth up to £10,000, but the green DIY style one is so fun to assemble
