A Rangers shareholder has complained to financial regulators about investor Sandy Easdale and asked them to launch an investigation.

The complaint follows comments made by Easdale on April 24 – the day before Rangers published their 120-day business review – when he described the financial position of the club as ‘fragile’.

Mark Dingwall — a former chairman of the Rangers Supporters Trust — has now written to the London Stock Exchange, the Financial Conduct Authority and Daniel Stewart, the club’s nominated advisors in the City, to express concerns.

The emails — seen by Sportsmail — ask each body to ‘investigate the possibility’ that Easdale ‘is acting as a shadow director of Rangers International Football Club plc and used knowledge derived from such a position to enrich himself via the buying of shares in the company’.

Sandy Easdale is not a member of the plc board – unlike brother James – but is a director of the Rangers Football Club Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary company.

The complainant states that Sandy Easdale has ‘apparent access’ to financial information from the plc and that he appeared to ‘have knowledge of the content of the commercially sensitive 120-day review prepared by the company’.

Dingwall’s email continues: ‘On April 24 the share price was 26p. That day after he (Easdale) made his statement it fell to 22p.

‘Mr Easdale bought 57,043 shares at 23p on May 1. By May 8, the price had recovered to 27p.

‘It is also noteworthy that Mr Easdale holds the voting rights to, but does not own, shares representing a further 22.10 per cent of RIFC Plc. I believe that, if he does have privileged financial information, those shareholders he holds proxies for may also have access to it or otherwise benefit from that knowledge.’

No comment was forthcoming last night from the Financial Conduct Authority, the London Stock Exchange or Daniel Stewart. Rangers declined to comment on the complaint.

Last week, supporter coalition the Union of Fans issued a statement questioning whether chief executive Graham Wallace or Easdale held the true boardroom power inside Ibrox.
