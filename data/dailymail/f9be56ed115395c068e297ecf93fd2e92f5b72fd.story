And that’s the way we like it. There is your advert for racism, right there at Richelieu-Drouot Metro station in the heart of Paris.

This poison has just been driven deeper underground, further than we ever thought possible on a night when football should have been celebrating the return of the Champions League.

It has resurfaced, a filthy stain on the game and the rest of society after an incident that took us to another era.

Chelsea fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side's match with Paris Saint-Germain

The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform

Fans were also filmed chanting 'We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it' while on the train

This is a throwback to Colin Ward’s book Steaming In, the depressing account of terrace culture at Chelsea, among others, in the Eighties.

What a way to remember the return of the Champions League, with a bunch of hoolies terrorising a black commuter as he attempts to board the subway in the centre of the city.

‘We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it,’ they chant after successfully forcing the guy back on to the platform before the doors slam shut.

How did he feel when he heard their slurred words, a stranger in his own city as a mob of filthy fans hurled their racist abuse at him on the platform? We should be embarrassed. We are embarrassed.

This is thug life, pervasive attitudes that have no place in society or this sport.

Those images, filmed by another passenger, are deeply disturbing because a pecking order quickly evolves, a clear delineation of cultures and colour.

There was a clear hierarchy, a ranking system based on numbers and a deep, underlying conviction that they could do what the hell they liked based on the colour of their skin.

It is difficult to frame that, to imagine how that is even possible.

They looked down on that commuter, twice shoving him off the carriage before the train doors closed and they made their way towards the Parc des Princes.

There is a greater shame here because we foolishly, naively, believed the issue of racism among our football supporters was a thing of the past.

We kidded ourselves, travelling to European cities convinced that this is an issue that was dealt with a long time ago.

Confronting it is difficult, too, because the temptation is to shy away, to cop a deaf ‘un and leave it to the authorities to pass on their message.

That is the easy way out, to be ignorant of the facts and wait for Chelsea to sift through the CCTV footage and hope they can identify the individuals concerned.

The morning after, as those Chelsea supporters head back to London via Eurostar, by plane or by boat across to Dover, they will be hoping to avoid detection.

Before kick-off in Parc des Princes, the music from John Murphy’s song 'In A Heartbeat' struck up when Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea emerged from the tunnel.

On the video screens Lionel Messi, Gareth Bale and David Luiz, among others, sent out their familiar message - Unite Against Racism - in the moments before Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir started the first leg.

We love these Champions League nights, the return of prime European football between some of the great teams after a break during the winter.

The game was decent enough, a 1-1 draw that satisfies both teams and tees up the second leg nicely at Stamford Bridge on March 17.

So how do the Chelsea players feel, waking up to see the footage of their own supporters from their own football club racially abusing someone who was probably on their way home from work?

There were six black players - Ramires, Willian, Kurt Zouma, Didier Drogba, Loic Remy and Juan Cuadrado - in Chelsea’s squad for the first leg in Paris. It feels awkward and wrong to even count them.

The message from the club was strong and clear, a warning that Chelsea will support a criminal investigation to identify those involved on that Paris Metro.

There should be one from the players too, conveying a powerful message from a united squad at Chelsea to make it clear that this behaviour from their fans is unacceptable.

They are under no obligation to do so, but it feels like it would be a start - a polite reminder - that it is time for society to move on.

Without it, we barely scratch beneath the surface.
