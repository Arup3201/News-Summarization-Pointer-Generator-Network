Apology: Former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers has taken to Twitter to apologise for his antics and to pledge to go to rehab

Former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers appears to have taken to Twitter today to apologise for his antics and to pledge to go to rehab.

In an account believed to have been set up by the disgraced 63-year-old, Flowers said he was seeking professional help, and issued an apology to all he had 'hurt or failed' through his actions.

Under the username @PaulFlowersRVD, the Methodist minister said he was due to speak to police officers tomorrow over drug allegations, and that he was 'nervous' as to whether he would be charged.

Although Flowers did not respond to requests to confirm that he was behind the account on the social networking sites, sources close to the minister said that it was genuine.

The cleric, who allegedly took cocaine and crystal meth and paid out hundreds of pounds for sex with rent boys, also used the same photograph of him standing beside a Christmas tree as on his newly-created Facebook account.

He wrote: 'I am sorry for all of this, & I am seeking professional help, and apologise to all I have hurt or failed by my actions, im looking at Rehab (sic).'

Responding to another Twitter user who said he was 'in a pretty bad place', Flowers said: 'I admit that to my credit, im seeking professional help and looking at Rehab, but I need to report to the police tomorrow.'

Earlier, after urging his 166 followers not to trust the media, he said: 'Actually thinking about taking the advice I've been given about going into rehab, but going to wait to see what happens ref my case first.'

The Twitter profile was opened yesterday evening, when Flowers wrote: 'House hunting is such a nightmare, so many choices #decisionsdecisions.'

Exposed: Flowers faces investigations by both the police and City regulators

Last week he was spotted back at his £300,000 house owned by the church, prompting anger among many parishioners that he had been allowed back in. 

The cleric is understood to be living rent-free in the four-bedroom house in Bradford, with the blessing of Methodist church leaders.

He then posted a picture of a quote which read: 'You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days of your life.'

Flowers also spoke of the police investigation into drug allegations, writing: 'Nervous about Tuesday to be charge or Not to be charged that is the question, think the media may be disappointed with the outcome ;).'

A spokesman from the Methodist Church said the church had been unaware of the account, and did not know if it was genuine.

Worry: Flowers said he was nervous over whether he was to be charged by police investigating the drug allegations

Flowers, who faces investigations by both the police and City regulators, was exposed by The Mail On Sunday last November when he was filmed counting out banknotes, allegedly to buy cocaine and crystal meth.

He is alleged to still be using the drug ketamine, often used as a horse tranquiliser, and meeting with male prostitutes.

According to a subsequent investigation by The Mail On Sunday, last Wednesday he asked a £400-a-night rent boy to visit him and promised: ‘I will have K [ketamine] but that’s all. You get what you want.’

 the lead-up its near collapse after running up £700million in losses.

He is expected to be called to testify at investigations into whether there was any failure or wrongdoing at the bank headed by industry watchdogs the Prudential Regulatory Authority, an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority.

Chancellor George Osborne has also called for an independent inquiry into the bank's actions, although that will not take place until the two watchdogs have completed their investigations.
