A professional footballer killed himself over the 'embarrassment' of his fiancee having an affair with the brother of England captain John Terry, an inquest heard today.

Dale Roberts, a goalkeeper with Rushden & Diamonds, hanged himself last December at the home he shared with partner Lindsey Cowan in Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire.

The inquest heard how Miss Cowan and Mr Roberts split up briefly after she had an affair with Paul Terry, 32, brother of John, in May 2010.

On the evening of her fiancee's death, Miss Cowan said she came home to find a final message from Mr Roberts written on the whiteboard in their kitchen.

It said: 'I love Lindsey Elizabeth Cowan very very much she is the love of my life.'

Mr Roberts, who also played for the semi-professional national team England C, had become withdrawn after
an injury and begun taking anti-depressants, which left him 'lethargic' 
and 'lacking motivation'.

The
day the 24-year-old was due to make his comeback for Rushden & 
Diamonds, he sent a text to his fiancee saying: 'I'm so scared about 
playing tonight'.

Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of suicide and the cause of death as asphyxia caused by hanging.

Manchester
City winger and England star Adam Johnson, a schoolfriend of Mr 
Roberts, said the pair had gone on holiday together shortly after rumours of the alleged affair became public.

He
said: 'I'm not sure he could deal with the embarrassment the story 
caused him. His death was a combination of the negative press and his 
leg injury.

'This was a
very sad and tragic conclusion to the life of a wonderful young man who
was a dear friend and he had a great future in the game and my heart 
goes out to his family.'

Rushden
& Diamonds club doctor Dr John Mellor told the inquest Mr Roberts 
came to him for help on November 19, 2010 and he prescribed him 
anti-depressants.

He saw him several weeks later and he was 'smiling' and 'training as normal', said Dr Mellor.

Mr Roberts's mother Isabelle revealed that Miss Cowan and her son had been at school together in Peterlee and had been in a relationship for the past six years.

'Betrayal': Paul Terry, left, brother of England star John, right, stayed on the couple's sofa occasionally before allegedly having an affair with Miss Cowan

She said he was 'really upset' after reports of his fiancee's affair with Terry made the newspapers.Â 

'He phoned us and said Lindsey had been having an affair with Paul Terry and gave strict instructions not to speak to the press.

'He was really upset because he gave him his couch and trusted him.'

In September, Mr Roberts became depressed after injuring his leg while playing for England C and began missing training at Rushden & Diamonds.

His mother added: 'I found him down and depressed, he had been missing training and not turning up at the club.

'He had began suffering panic attacks and said he couldn't go to Asda.

'I believe it was because he thought people recognised him and was worried about what people would say.'

Miss Cowan, 26, told the hearing that Paul Terry stayed at their house 'from time to time' but that after they got back together they were able to laugh and joke about it.

Shortly before his death he was avoiding training and his team-mates, she added.

She said: 'He began crying, he said he couldn't go to training because he couldn't be bothered anymore.

'He kept saying over and over "my body can't take it" and was very lethargic and wanted to sleep.

'Dale told him [his agent Cyrille Regis] Justin [Edinburgh, his manager] had shouted at him and said, "if you were my son I would kick you up the backside". Dale said he asked for a counsellor but did not get one.'

He received a text message the night before he died from Mr Edinburgh telling him he was to start the game the following day.

The next morning he sent Miss Cowan a text 
message saying that he was scared. His body was found 3.30pm after 
police were told he had not attended pre-match training an hour and a 
half before.

Mr Edinburgh told the inquest his player 'had no motivation'.

He said: 'He was quite distant. Dale wasn't the greatest communicator off the pitch. He was such a nice lad, I wish I could have done more to have stopped this.'

Mr Roberts's mother stormed out of the inquest as the manager gave his evidence.

Club physio Harry Bedford told the inquest Mr Roberts had suffered palpitations and had distanced himself from other players shortly before his death.

Coroner Anne Pember said: 'From the evidence I believe at the time when he was feeling low and depressed he made a decision he no longer wanted to live.'

Outside the court a statement was read out by Mr Roberts's parents, George and Isabelle.

It read: 'We wish to thank everyone for their help and support and and kindness over the past year. It's been a difficult time for everyone concerned but the love and support we've been shown has helped us during this difficult time.'

Mr Roberts joined Rushden & Diamonds in January 2009 and had loan spells with Eastwood Town and Alfreton Town while on the books at Championship side Nottingham Forest.

Forest's chief executive Mark Arthur described Dale as a 'talented' goalkeeper with a 'highly promising career' and said his death was a tragedy.

Paul Terry - who was given a free transfer to Darlington after the alleged affair emerged, and now plays for Thurrock - did not attend the inquest.

He is married to the Leicester City left-back Paul Konchesky's sister Sarah.
