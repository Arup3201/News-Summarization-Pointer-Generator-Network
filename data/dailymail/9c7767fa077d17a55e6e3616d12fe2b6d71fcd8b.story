Parts of Chile were evacuated today after the nation was struck by a strong earthquake.

Amid fears a tsunami could follow the tremor, thousands in the South American country were warned to leave their homes and seek higher ground.

The earthquake struck 37 miles from the port city of Iquique, at a depth of 12.4 miles below ground. It was initially measured at 7.0 on the Richter scale, which was later revised to 6.7.

Worse in Chile: 100,000 people were ordered to higher ground in the wake of the first Chile tremor on Sunday evening

It caused the Chilean Navy to issue an evacuation order in case of a tsunami, though the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they were not expecting one.

The ONEMI emergency office said that preliminarily no damage or injuries had been reported. Nobody seems to have been injured by the quake.

Chile's massive copper mines mines, clustered in the mineral-rich North, appeared unscathed. Collahuasi, a partnership between Glencore Xstrata and Anglo American, located in the area, said operations were normal.

People could be seen today gathered on high ground outside the northern towns of Arica and Tocopilla, which the Navy had warned were at risk.

Warning: The Navy warned that there could be a small tsunami, though other experts did not agree

Safe: No significant damage was reported as a result of the earthquake
