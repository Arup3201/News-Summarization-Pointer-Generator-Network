Farmers have hailed a 'miracle' after a cow at a nursery with no bulls suddenly gave birth to a calf.

Harriet the cow has lived a life of celibacy since she moved to Pinewood Nurseries in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire.

But owner Liz Robinson was left stunned when  the Dexter cow suddenly went into labour and gave birth to calf Petal.

Harriet the cow with calf Petal - who she bore despite living on a farm which doesn't have any bulls

Liz Robinson, from Pinewood Nurseries in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, said she was shocked by the birth

Ms Robinson, 30, said workers are calling Petal the 'moo-siah', adding: 'We had absolutely no idea Harriet was pregnant until she woke us up in labour.

'She didn't look any different to the others - just another fat cow. We have never bred cows at the nursery so we don't have any bulls.

'We weren't told Harriet was pregnant when we bought her so when Petal arrived we were all stumped.'

Ms Robinson has owned Pinewood with her husband, Tom, and her sister Maria Jackson, both 33, for just over ten years.

They have been rearing Dexter cows for meat in their farm shop for four years but have never bred their own, instead they buy them in from a livestock supplier.

As a result they have never needed a stud on the farm and were shocked when Harriet woke them up with labour noises in the middle of the night.

Farm workers have started calling little petal 'the moo-siah' after her unexpected birth in December

Ms Robinson said: 'One of the cows woke Tom up with their loud lowing. He rushed down to see what was going on.

'When he got there Harriet was in the middle of labour and that was the first we knew.

'We thought some of the others might have been pregnant, but we've had no babies since.'

Fortunately for Petal - named after the flowers grown at the nursery - she is not destined to be sold in the farm shop.

Her surprise appearance on December 8 2014, eight months after Harriet had arrived at Pinewood with six other cows. 

A clue on the calf's appearance may lie in the fact that the typical gestation period for a cow is around nine months. 

Ms Robinson says Harriet is the only one of six cows brought in last summer to have given birth
