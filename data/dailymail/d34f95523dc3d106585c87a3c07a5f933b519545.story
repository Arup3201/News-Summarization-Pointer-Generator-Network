Hundreds of Goldman Sachs bankers are expected to be handed a new type of pay deal to prevent their bonuses being cut.

The Wall Street giant has drawn up plans that will help it side-step laws designed to curb excessive City payouts.

EU rules which came into force on January 1 are supposed to stop the casino-style behaviour that led to the financial crisis. They state that annual bonuses can be no higher than base salary.

But bosses at Goldman Sachs have devised a way to get around the rules and let them continue to lavish vast rewards on their staff.

As well as their basic pay – which at Goldman is already an average of £367,000 a year – hundreds of top bankers at the firm will receive ‘role-based allowances’.

Although details are yet to be confirmed, these could be paid several times a year – possibly monthly – and are likely to be in shares.

Unlike bonuses, they will not be conditional on performance and will not count towards the calculations of the bonus cap.

Goldman joins Barclays and HSBC, which are already planning to hand staff extra shares to get around the Brussels edict.

Once the scheme comes into force, the added pay will be back-dated to the start of the year.

Goldman employs around 5,000 in London and it is thought hundreds of staff will be included in the new pay scheme. It is understood the plan is yet to be signed off by the regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, which could still block it.

The Bank of England, which runs the PRA, said it would not discuss individual firms.

When the EU was drawing up the rules, critics said it would only lead to banks hiking the pay of their staff. Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff.

Barclays and HSBC are already planning to hand out multi-million shares in a bid to avoid the cap. They were accused of ‘concocting elaborate schemes’ to dodge the rules.

City workers saw their pay rise by a third last year. The top 2,700 London bankers took home an average £1.6million each, making Britain’s financial elite the highest paid in Europe.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby previously said foreign-owned banks in the City of London were ‘in denial’ about their role in the financial crisis.

Luke Hildyard, director at the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Goldman Sachs clearly think they can continue to throw around obscene and unmerited pay packages for their top bankers, while wages for ordinary UK workers remain lower than they were ten years ago.

‘This doesn’t seem to be within the letter or the spirit of the new bonus cap rules.’

Goldman Sachs refused to comment.
