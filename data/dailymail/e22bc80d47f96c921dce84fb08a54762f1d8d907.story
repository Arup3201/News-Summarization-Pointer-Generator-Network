The Islamic State militant group claims teenage terrorist Numan Haider's stabbing of two police officers was a call to action by the group's leader.

The terrorist attack, which led to Haider being shot dead on September 23, was highlighted in the propaganda magazine Dabiq claiming that the group's spokesperson Shaykh Abu Mohammad ordered for attacks to be launched in western countries just days before the Melbourne incident.

'These attacks were the direct result of the Shaykh's call to action, and they highlight what a deadly tinderbox is fizzing just beneath the surface of every western country, waiting to explode into violent action at any moment given the right conditions,' the publication read according to the The Herald Sun.

The 18-year-old was killed with a single shot to the head after stabbing two police officers outside the Endeavour Hills Police Station and making audible threats against Prime Minister Tony Abbott. 

The two police officers had planned to meet Haider to discuss his Australian passport being cancelled. 

Counsel assisting the coroner, Jessica Wilby, said during the first hearing at the Victorian Coroners Court in October that Haider attacked without warning as the officers approached him in a car park of a nearby childcare centre, 9news reported.

Ms Wilby said Haider stabbed a Victoria Police officer in the arm and an Australian Federal Police officer in the chest and face.

The court heard he was on top of the AFP officer continuing his attack when the Victoria Police officer shouted for him to drop his weapon before opening fire.

The matter will return to court at a date yet to be announced.
