After the coldest Easter Sunday on record, you’d hope for a brief respite from the Arctic weather.

But it seems spring is shaping up to be colder than winter was, with no sign of temperatures warming up.

The bank holiday weekend was yesterday confirmed as the coldest Easter since records began in 1960, with temperatures dipping well below freezing.

On Saturday, overnight temperatures 
plummeted to -12.5C (9.5F) in Braemar, Scotland, eclipsing the previous 
record of -9.8C (14.4F) on Easter Monday in 1986.

According
to the book Daily Temperature Extremes for Britain, the previous low 
for March 31 was -10C (14F) at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire, in 1941.

The
unseasonable temperatures came as the Met Office confirmed March is on 
course to be colder than winter this year for the first time since 1975.

The monthly average temperature until 
March 26 was 2.5C (36.5), colder than December at 3.8C (38.8F), January 
at 3.3C (37.9F), and February at 2.8C (37F).

The average March temperature in the Central Region used by forecasters – the area bordered by London, Manchester and Bristol – is currently 3.2C (37.8F)

If this figure stays the same it will be the coldest March since 1962.

Greg Dewhurst, from the Met Office, said: ‘It looks like it could be the coldest temperature experienced over the Easter period.

‘It is likely to be the coldest March since 1962.

‘At the moment there is no sign  of the weather getting warmer as by the end of the week temperatures still remain low with a maximum of about 8C (46.4F) in some places by Friday.’

The chill is in stark contrast to the same time last year when Britain enjoyed a mini heatwave, with temperatures in March  soaring to 21C (69.8F).

Bookmaker Ladbrokes paid out more than £250,000 to gamblers who correctly predicted a white Easter after snow fell in the Hackney and Croydon areas of London on Saturday.

Forecasters also predicted the bitterly cold weather would continue into today.

They advised people to wrap up warm as a 15mph south-easterly wind is expected to make temperatures feel as low as -2C (28.4F) in some places.

Sleet and snow showers are predicted in southern parts of the UK, most likely in Kent and East Anglia, but the rest of the country is set to be dry with sunny spells, with maximum temperatures of 7C (44.6F).

Tonight temperatures could dip to as low as -10C (14F) in Scotland, and as low as -2C (28.4F) elsewhere in the UK.

It is predicted the below-average temperatures will remain until mid-April.

David Cameron performed a ewe turn by wading in to a swamp to rescue a stranded sheep after a day helping a neighbour with lambing in his rural Oxfordshire constituency, he told visitors to Number 10.

'Well, I helped my neighbour with his lambing one weekend and that gave me more pleasure than anything I've done for a long time,' he said after being asked what he would do after politics.

'He lost one of his ewes and so we were bottle-feeding some of his lambs and then one of his sheep got stuck in a swamp,' he told one of the winners of the Mum of the Year awards.

The sheep had followed her two lambs in to try to save them, but they drowned.

Mr Cameron and his two armed guards waded in waist-deep to push the ewe to safety.

The ewe has been renamed Swampy and is said to be fully recovered.

Farmer Julian Tustian told the Daily Telegraph: 'He was brilliant, pulling, pushing and shoving. He was covered in mud, he looked a mess. He didn't have to do it.'

Meanwhile the cold snap has  led to a 
shortage of daffodils, which are four weeks late in flowering, and has 
also taken a devastating toll on wildlife.

Last week it was feared thousands of 
newborn lambs had starved or been buried in snow drifts and thousands of
puffins are expected to die of starvation, unable to find food in the 
rough seas.

Hundreds of frozen and emaciated 
corpses have already been washed up on the east coast.

The birds, which 
are on an RSPB watch list because of declining numbers, usually come 
ashore to breed at this time of year.

But the prolonged cold weather has made this a fatal move, with experts describing the death toll as the worst in 50 years.

Hedgehogs,
grass snakes and slow-worms are also struggling to survive as they 
emerge from hibernation to find the weather unseasonably cold.

Last 
night rescue teams searching for a missing skier who was killed by an 
avalanche in the Scottish Highlands revealed they had found his body.

Daniel
Maddox, 41, from Clackmannanshire, was skiing in an off-piste area 
behind Glencoe Ski Centre when the avalanche struck at about 1pm 
yesterday.

÷ An entire 
troupe of performing fleas has fallen victim to the freezing 
temperatures in Germany. 

Flea circus director Robert Birk found all of 
his 300 fleas dead  inside their transport box last Wednesday morning.

An insect expert was able to train 50 more in time for yesterday’s show at an open-air fair in the town of Mechernich-Kommern.

Organiser Michael Faber said: ‘I hope we’ll get through this without any more fatalities.’
