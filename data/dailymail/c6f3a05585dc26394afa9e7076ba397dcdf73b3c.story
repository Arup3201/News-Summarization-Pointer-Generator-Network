For young people, the upcoming European elections may not be the most exciting event in the world, so the Danish parliament tried to sex-up the ballot in a new TV advert, literally.

Featuring a bare-chested hero called Voteman, the advert starts as he is in bed with five women, and follows him as he punches non-voters in the face and interrupts another couple having sex in order to get them to a voting station.

The video was posted on YouTube and the Danish parliament website, but was removed after an outcry over its lewd and unprofessional content.

A lewd cartoon made by the Danish parliament and designed to get young people to vote has been removed from YouTube after an outcry over it's explicit content

The cartoon features Voteman, a bare-chested hero who forces people to vote. The video starts while he is in bed with five women, one of whom appears to be performing oral sex

As the vote begins Voteman leaves his harem of ladies behind in order to force people to the ballot box

Anders Samuelsen, a Liberal Alliance 
party MP, told the news agency Ritzau: 'I can't understand that you 
would use violence against women, porn, and the handout of
 I don't know how many slaps as an argument for people to go and vote.'

Defending the clip, parliament chairman Mogens Lykketoft told news site DR Nyheder: 'We are trying to inspire the very young.

'A
 high turnout is important, so you use every method you can. There was a
 bit of discussion in parliament, but I do think it is quite innocent. 
You can find much worse.'

However, in an email sent to members of staff later in the day he conceded:  'Many people whose opinions I deeply 
respect have perceived the cartoon from the EU information centre as far
 more serious and offensive than it was intended – and believe it talks 
down to young people.

'I acknowledge that the parliament as an institution, should be more careful in the future about what we put our name on.'

He rides away on the backs of two dolphins looking for young people not voting in the European Election

In one particularly graphic scene he pulls the duvet off a couple having sex before throwing them out a window

The Danish government initially tried to defend the video, but later removed it from their website

The clip starts with Voteman lying in bed with five naked women, one of which appears to be performing oral sex on him.

As the election begins he leaves his harem of ladies behind, riding away on the backs of two dolphins in order to get people to vote.

First he is seen punching a non-voter in the face before hurling him into a ballot box, before dragging and kicking various other non-voters into the voting booths.

In another risque scene he rips off a duvet from a couple having sex before sending the naked man and woman out of the window.

Voteman is also seen punching a non-voter in the face before throwing him into a voting booth

Talking about the video, the Danish election coordinator said the video needed to be 'fun and interesting' in order to appeal to young people

The video ends with a phoney disclaimer saying that 'no hipsters were hurt in the making of this film'

Politicians in Denmark had said the video was designed to engage with the young ahead of the elections on May 25.

The Copenhagen Post reported Voteman bellows 'You've gotta vote' before a final disclaimer reveals that 'no hipsters were harmed in the making of this film'.

Martin Jørgensen, parliament's EU election co-ordinator, said: 'It is first and foremost intended to draw attention to the election and the date.

'It needs to be fun and interesting to get the message across.'
