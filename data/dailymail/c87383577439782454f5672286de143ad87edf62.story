Uniformed Romanian police officers have begun patrolling the streets of Paris to help fight a growing tide of criminality among their immigrant countrymen.

In scenes which could soon be replicated in Britain, 20 officers have been introduced to help clamp down on Roma street gangs.

It follows a 78 per cent rise in the number of Romanians arrested in the France city over the past two years.

In January, the UK is expected to see an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving when EU labour restrictions are lifted.

There have been warnings that they will include criminal gangs that often use children to target their victims.

Last month a squad of eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland joined the Metropolitan Police on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database.

In France it has been reported that Romanian teenagers work with adult gangsters to prey on tourists visiting famous monuments like Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre museum.

The Roma gangs use a variety of tricks to try to con money out of people, including pretending to be deaf and dumb, or saying they are involved in charity collections.

If these fail, they pickpocket their victims, or threaten them with violence before running off.

The situation has become so bad, that the Romanian officers were drafted in last week – mainly because they can communicate with the gangs.

A statement issued by police in the French capital reads: ‘Wearing their own uniforms, they are taking part in patrols of public areas and supporting their French colleagues in securing the major tourist and shopping centres.’

The statement says they will ‘contribute to collecting information, and to the identification of Romanian criminal networks’.

At present, most of the gang members say they cannot speak a word of French, making dealing with them hugely difficult.

Many are illegal immigrants who never carry any kind of identification papers either. Ten Romanian police are now based permanently in France and have helped break up 10 suspected theft rings in less than a year.

The scheme has now been extended to officers patrolling the streets with at least 20 officers based in the city.

It has led to a five per cent drop in Romanian street crime this year, but the French government said that Romanians from the impoverished eastern European state are still responsible for a massive amount of anti-social behaviour.

Many live in vast illegal camps on the outskirts of Paris which the police regularly try to shut down.  

Children arrested by the police can seldom be prosecuted, and are instead let off with a caution at most, leaving them free to carry on with their crimes.

In September, Manuel Valls, the France’s Socialist Interior Minister, said most of the estimated 20,000 Romanians in France had no intention of integrating into society and should be deported.

This has led to an outcry among opponents, including many in his own party, who think that eastern European immigrants should be given a chance to build lives for themselves abroad.

Attempts to deport them usually end with those sent home coming straight back again.

Last month, Paris police smashed a Romanian pickpocketing ring which trafficked hundreds of children across Europe, including Britain.

All recruits were threatened with severe beatings if they did not go out to steal.

More than 200 children, some as young as 12, were given targets of stealing up to £250 a day before being dropped off in the centre of the city, and ordered to target tourists.

Many of the minors involved were arrested, cautioned and released hundreds of times, but were simply sent back out to steal.

Gangs of aggressive Roma youngsters have become a routine sight in central Paris, especially around cash points.
