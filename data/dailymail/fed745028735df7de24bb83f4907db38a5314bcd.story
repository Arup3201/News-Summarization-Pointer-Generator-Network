Modou Barrow is set to join Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season. 

The 22-year-old is expected to complete the move in the coming days, with Swansea manager Garry Monk keen for the winger to get first-team football. 

Sportsmail understands an agreement has been reached, but paperwork for the deal has not been completed.

Barrow joined Swansea from Swedish club Ostersunds last September and quickly landed an improved four-year contract last month. 

Club staff have been deeply impressed by his progress, but having made only one Premier League start this season it has been deemed necessary to send him to the Championship club for extra experience.

Barrow's only Premier League start came against Sunderland at the Liberty Stadium on February 7.
