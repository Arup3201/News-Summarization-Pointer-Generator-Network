Charles Eugster lived up to his nickname as 'the world's fittest Old Aged Pensioner' after smashing the Indoor 200m world record at the ripe old age of 95.

The retired dentist, racing in the over-95 age-group at the British Masters Indoor Championships meeting in London, ran the distance in 55.48seconds to beat the previous record, set in 2013, by 2.4seconds.

The elderly athlete set a pace that most people his age could only imagine and barely looked out of breath after he had crossed the finish line before celebrating his record breaking achievement.

'I hoped getting fit would stop me ageing,' he told The Telegraph in 2013.

'It was pure vanity, really. I looked a mess and I was having a late-life crisis. My body was degenerating. 

'I thought: 'Who knows about muscles?' So, when I was 87, I joined a bodybuilding club.'
