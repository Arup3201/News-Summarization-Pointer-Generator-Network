An overweight mother of two shed five stone after being inspired to get healthy when her young son was left fighting for his life after contracting a dangerous bout of bronchiolitis.

Librarian Anna Lloyd, 35, from Crewe, Cheshire, had weighed 16st 4lb after giving birth to Isaac in December 2011 thanks to her love of Indian takeaways and ready meals.

But it wasn't until little Isaac's life hung in the balance at just 11 days old that Anna was inspired to make some changes to her lifestyle and get fit.

Anna Lloyd vowed to lose weight after her little boy Isaac contracted bronchiolitis at just 11 days old - she wanted to be healthy for her family and now weighs 11st 4lb

Poor little Isaac, pictured in ICU in January 2012 was left with his life hanging in the balance after contracting the respiratory tract infection at just 11 days old  

As Isaac, now three years old, battled against his illness, tied up to a respiratory machine, Anna made a 'bargain' at his hospital bedside that they should both get healthy. 

When Isaac recovered and was allowed out of hospital, she kept her promise by joining her local Slimming World group and started exercising and her weight dropped to a much healthier 11st 4lb.

Anna said: 'At one stage it was touch and go for Isaac. It was like his lungs had given up and he was being constantly monitored. 

Anna has now lost weight and is happy with her family. She is pictured here with her husband Tim and their two children Isaac and Isabel

Anna cradled a new born Isaac when he was just three days old, shortly before he was taken back into hospital with an infection

'I sat by his bedside and it dawned on me that he might not survive. It was the worst moment of my life. 

'That's when I made a bargain with him. I said: "If you get healthy for me, I promise I'll get healthy for you."'

She continued: 'Now looking at Isaac, you'd never guess what he went through when he was only days old. 

'He's my inspiration and I'm going to make sure I stay fit and healthy so I can be the mum he deserves.'

Anna said she always the 'fat girl' when she was growing up and was teased right through school: 'My parents tried to get me to eat healthily but you have to want it for yourself and I always loved sweets and chocolates.

On her wedding day in 2007 Anna was a size 20, she said her husband, Tim, was one of the first people to accept her for her size

'When I met my husband Tim I was a size 18 and 14st which made me very shy and self-conscious. I didn't think anyone would love me just for me but Tim saw passed my size and we got married in September 2007 with me in a size 20 dress.'

In 2008 Anna fell pregnant and found that her weight spiralled out of control, as she felt like she had a 'green light' to eat whatever she wanted. 

With a BMI of 40, Anna was warned that hers was a 'high risk' pregnancy and she was closely monitored throughout. But everything went smoothly and her daughter Isabel was born in November 2008 weighing 8lb 4oz.

At her largest Anna was gorging on take-aways and unhealthy ready meals. She has since joined Slimming World and dropped five stone

But Anna struggled to lose the weight she'd gained during the pregnancy and even stayed in her maternity clothes as Isabel grew into a toddler.

By the time Anna fell pregnant with her second baby, in March 2011, she weighed 16st 4lb at just 5ft 4in tall.

'My doctor suggested I join a slimming group for overweight mums, which was mortifying, but I found it really helpful and it stopped me gaining more weight during my pregnancy,' said Anna. 

'Isaac was born weighing 8lb 9oz but just a week after we brought him home he developed a nasty cough and it got so bad we had to rush him back into hospital.

'By the time we got him there, he was struggling to breathe and started to turn blue. Everything happened really quickly. A doctor said he had bronchiolitis and had oxygen piped into a headbox to help him breathe.'

Anna is now a size 12 and she says she wanted to be healthy for her children 

Lttle Isaac was hooked up to a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine which encouraged his lungs to work and was transferred by ambulance to Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool where he was ventilated and won his battle for life.

With Isaac on the road to recovery, Anna joined her local Slimming World group, cut out fatty takeaways and started to make her own healthy meals, incorporating lots of fresh vegetables and lean met. 

Along with her new healthy diet, Anna started walking regularly and even took part in a 5k Race for Life. After a year she started boot-camp classes and her fitness improved by leaps and bounds.

Isaac is now happy and healthy and although he still has some problems with his breathing Anna has revealed that it hasn't stopped him living a good life

After three years of healthy eating and exercise, Anna has dropped an impressive 5st, now weighing 11st 4lb, with another stone to lose to reach her target weight of 10st 4lb.

She now helps other people who are eager to lose weight as she leads two Slimming World classes each week. 'Losing weight has improved every aspect of my life,' she added. 

'I can spend quality time with my family doing things I wouldn't have dreamed of before, like going for long walks and swimming. Now I'm a size 12, I can shop wherever I want, not just in plus size stores, which is fantastic.'

As for Isaac, he's grown into a happy, confident and active toddler. He still has a weakness in his lungs and uses his inhaler three times a day but that doesn't stop him from jumping and climbing, she says.
