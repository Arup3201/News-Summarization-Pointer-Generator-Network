A college student has been charged with sexually assaulting 19-year-old woman after he allegedly attempted to recreate Fifty Shades of Grey.

Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of tying up his victim, a fellow student, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The engineering student has admitted to police that he assaulted the woman, but explained to them that it was because they were 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey'. 

Charged: Mohammad Hossain, 19, is accused of tying up a fellow student, also 19, whipping and punching her before raping her in his dormitory at the University of Illinois at Chicago

Mr Hossain, a college freshman and student ambassador to the alumni association, and the alleged victim went to his room on Saturday afternoon.

Hossain is said to have asked her to remove her clothing, which she consented to but kept her bra and underwear on, before tying her hands and legs with belts, the Chicago Tribune reports.

He used a necktie to cover her mouth and pulled a knit cap over her eyes, before removing her underwear, Assistant State's Attorney Sarah Karr told the Cook County court.

Mr Hossain then struck her several times with a belt before she told him to stop as he was hurting her, the court heard.

The woman 'began shaking her head and crying', but Mr Hossain is said to have continued to hit her with the belt and also punched her several times.

Assault: The victim, also a University of Illinois at Chicago student, said Mr Hossain continued to whip and punch her with his fists after she began crying and telling him to stop, before proceeding to rape her

Despite the victim crying and continuing to beg him to stop, Mr Hossein held her arms behind her back and sexually assaulted her, an arrest warrant claims.

The woman left Mr Hossain's dorm after the alleged assault and reported the incident to the police.

Mr Hossain was arrested by campus police, and after admitting to 'doing something wrong' and assaulting the woman, he told officers they had been 're-enacting scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey', Ms Karr said according to the newspaper.

Mr Hossain remains in custody on a $500,000 bail. His lawyer claims he thought the sex was consensual.

The hit film Fifty Shades of Grey is an adaptation of the adaptation of the best-selling novel by British author E.L. James.

The film, which stars James Dornan as BDSM-loving billionaire Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as innocent college student Anastasia 'Ana' Steele, spent a second weekend at the top of the U.S. and Canadian box office charts.

Fifty Shades, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, has already racked up $410 million in global sales in less than two weeks, according to Universal Pictures.
