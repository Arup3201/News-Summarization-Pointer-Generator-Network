Greens Senator, Sarah Hanson-Young has mocked her haters in a video she posted to YouTube showing her reading out abuse from her harshest online trolls.

Not a stranger to public criticism, the senator read out some of the most insulting tweets in a Youtube video titled 'Pleasantries with Sarah Hanson-Young: Part One.'

The video shows Hanson-Young attempting to stay collected with a straight face, but lets out a raucous laugh at her third encounter with the word 'cow.'

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young had read out harsh tweets from online trolls, in a bid to mock them

She attempts to remain composed and keep a straight face, but breaks into laughter at being called a 'cow'

'I could eat a can of Alphabet soup and crap more sense than she makes,' reads one of the harsh tweets

The tweets, Facebook statuses and anonymous personal messages mock her physical appearance, gender and alleged incompetence.

'Your brain seems to be in sync with your surname; It has a split in the middle,' one of the tweets said.

'Head like a busted sand shoe and a brain to match' read another.

The Senator's lighthearted approach to these trolls mirrors Jimmy Kimmel's segment on his talk show titled 'mean tweets.' 

His segment shows celebrities read out insulting tweets about themselves, resulting in their uncontrollable laughter or vacant expressions.

Twitter's directory of public-policy, Julie Inman-Grant says that users cannot engage in repeated harassment and issue violent threats

The video, titled 'Pleasantries with Sarah Hanson-Young Part 1' alludes there is more to come from the Senator

According to The Advertiser, the tweets and messages breach Twitter's terms of use that are in place to lessen negativity directed at other users.

Twitter's directory of public-policy, Julie Inman-Grant says that users cannot engage in repeated harassment and issue violent threats.

'We have announced a number of improvements to user controls to help people protect themselves,' she said. 

This has come after an incident in 2013 that saw the Senator's head photoshopped onto the body of a nearly naked model for ZOO Magazine.

She won the defamation case, claiming she was made to look incompetent and immature.

The Senator's YouTube video has hinted at more to come with the title alluding to a sequel to 'Part One.'
