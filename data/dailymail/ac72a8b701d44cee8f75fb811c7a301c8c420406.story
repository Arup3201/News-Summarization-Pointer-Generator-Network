A seven-year-old boy died in a fire in a slum house after the wealthy landlord who owned the property left the batteries out of the smoke alarm.

Ajit Singh, 50, has been jailed for taking a series of health and safety shortcuts across the 14 properties he owned in Kettering, Northamptonshire, which left them 'like a death-trap'.

There was only one smoke detector in the terraced house where young Mateusz Wlodarczyk lived, a court heard, and its battery had been disconnected, meaning it failed to go off when a fire broke out due to an electrical fault.

There were also no fire doors in the 
premises and the front door could only be opened from the inside with a 
key - preventing the occupants from escaping quickly.

Firefighters battled to rescue the boy after the blaze took hold of the property in Edinburgh Road on May 22 last year.

But he suffocated after inhaling thick plumes of smoke.

An inquest heard that if the fire alarm had been fitted then the youngster would have probably survived.

Earlier this year Singh - who himself lives in a swanky £350,000 detached house in Kettering - pleaded guilty to failing to take general fire precautions at nine properties he owned in run-down areas of the town.

He was jailed yesterday for nine months by Judge Rupert Mayo and also ordered to pay £7,500 in costs.

Prosecutor Cameron Crowe told the court: 'Legislation means that the person responsible for a property is required legally to maintain a standard of fire safety to properly secure the safety of the occupants.

'The fire precautions fell woefully short at Edinburgh Road and the fire subsequently claimed the life of a seven-year-old boy.

'The lengths taken to prevent fire at other properties owned by Singh was grossly inadequate.'

Northampton Crown Court heard that most of the houses for which Singh faced charges were lived in by several people - known as houses of multiple occupancy - which greatly increased the risk of fire.

Two other men, who acted as property managers for Singh, escaped jail after being sentenced for the same charges relating to different properties.

Husseyin Ozzengin, 45, from Kettering, was handed a four-month sentence, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work.

And Waldemar Ordynowski, 41, from Kettering, was sentenced to three months, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 175 hours of unpaid work.

The pair were also ordered to pay £2,000 in court costs.

Speaking outside court, Martyn Emberson, chief fire officer of Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'This case clearly demonstrates how seriously fire safety breaches are viewed by the courts.

'I hope it sends a clear message to landlords and managing agents across the county.'

He added that fire services actively investigate houses of multiple occupancy as they are the highest risk premises, often housing vulnerable people who might be exploited by landlords.

The failure to take general fire precaution charges relates to breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order.

Under the order the person responsible for a property must ensure adequate fire alarms and protectors are in place in a property, adequate emergency escape routes and exits are in place, and adequate 'fire compartmenation' is in place, to prevent the spread of fire and smoke.
