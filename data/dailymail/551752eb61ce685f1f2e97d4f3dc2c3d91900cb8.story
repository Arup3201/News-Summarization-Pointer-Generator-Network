The eight children kidnapped from foster care by their biological parents have been found by NYPD’s regional fugitive task force.

Shanel Nadal, 28, and Nephra Payne, 34, have been taken into custody by police, while their children have been placed with the Harrisburg Administration for Children’s Services in Pennsylvania.

The children, who were taken during a supervised visit last week, were found safe and ‘in good condition’ in Harrisburg, police said in a statement.

The seven sons aged between four and 11, all called Nephra, and the 11-month-old daughter, Neferiti, were originally placed in a foster care facility in Queens, New York, following allegations of abuse.

The New York mother is believed to have revealed her plan in a text message the day before the abduction.

Lower Manhattan resident Shanel was on an supervised visit with her children last Monday when she snatched her seven boys and daughter Nefertiti.

Amieka Smith, who cares for two of Nadal's kids, told the New York Daily News that she received a disturbing text from her before they vanished.

'I cannot live without my children. I cannot breathe without my children,' Nadal wrote.

The children had been taken away from Nadal and their father Nephra Payne, 34, after a domestic abuse incident, and were placed in three separate foster homes.

Police said last week that Mr Payne may have had a hand in the abduction. 

Ms Smith said Nadal was desperate to be with her children, and felt her 'back was against the wall.'

She told the News: 'She isn't a monster. She just loves her kids. I cannot say I'm surprised she tried.'

The snatch happened at the Forestdale Child Agency in Forest Hills, Queens, where the children, were sneaked out into a black vehicle and driven away at high speed.

'Everybody is shocked, nobody expected this,' one of the children’s foster parents said today.

Police were not sure of the vehicle's model but think it could have been a 1996 Chevrolet Suburban, a 2003 Ford Sedan or a 1993 Infiniti.

Found: The eight children, seven called Nephra and the other called Nefertiti, had been fostered to three different familes

People involved with the children since they were taken into care expressed their concern at the abduction.

Corey King, 31, whose sister Linda Mitchell has fostered five of the boys, told the News that he and his sister were devastated.

'These kids were taken away from their parents for domestic abuse,' he said. 'We are worried for their safety. We are afraid they might get hurt.'

The children have lived with him and his sister in their Queens home for three years.

'They came to us with emotional scars, but they are good kids,' he said.

'They just need a good home. They are used to us now.'
