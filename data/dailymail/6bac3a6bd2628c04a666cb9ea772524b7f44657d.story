Spain begin the defence of their European Championship title against Macedonia in a qualifier on Tuesday evening but a crucial selection dilemma faces head coach Vicente del Bosque ahead of the tie.

Who should Del Bosque start as No 1 - Real Madrid veteran Iker Casillas, or Manchester United stopper David de Gea?

It seems peculiar to think that Casillas' position in goal is under threat, yet the voices calling for the 33-year-old to be replaced are growing in both number and volume.

Casillas has won a national record 156 caps, he skippered Spain to their first ever World Cup triumph, and he led his nation to an unprecedented third major title in a row since his debut 14 years ago.

De Gea, on the other hand, has been capped just twice for his country and playing just 97 minutes in the process.

If the choice was to be measured on just experience and pedigree alone, there is no comparison - yet when form, age and ability are introduced, it becomes a far closer contest.

Whereas Casillas crumbled under the pressure during the World Cup - including putting in a calamitous showing against Holland in Spain's 5-1 group stage loss - and has failed to nail down the No 1 jersey at Real, De Gea has been one of the bright sparks in Louis van Gaal's otherwise disastrous reign at Old Trafford to date.

The 23-year-old struggled during his first season in the Premier League but, in the three campaigns since, he has become one of the finest 'keepers in the league - assured under the high ball, cool in one-on-one situations and superb as a shot-stopper.

Nightmare: Casillas endured a torrid World Cup campaign, including a disastrous display against Holland

De Gea was between the sticks for Spain's 2-0 loss to France last week and made some crucial saves to keep the score respectable. The feeling around the country is that Del Bosque may part with the old - Xabi Alonso and Xavi have already retired - and try and blood in a new generation of players, including at goalkeeper. 

Jose Mourinho dropped Casillas two years ago and, although many thought it was merely a trademark Special One-style move designed to cement his authority, the goalkeeper has not recovered since.

His position as Real's first choice has not been assured throughout the whole of Carlo Ancelotti's reign at the club, but he has been an ever-present in the Spain line-up during that time.

If rumours are to be believed, however, then Casillas may no longer be No 1 for club or country.

Step forward David de Gea...
