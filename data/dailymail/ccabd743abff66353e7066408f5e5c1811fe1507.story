Kind-hearted Ann Maguire took in and brought up her two young nephews when their mother died of cancer while only in her 30s.

The murdered teacher stepped in to care for brothers Daniel and Andrew Poole after her sister Eileen Poole's death in 1986.

She became a 'mother figure' to the boys, according to one family member, raising them along with her own two daughters in her semi-detached home in Leeds.

Caring: Mrs Maguire was described as a 'wonderful' teacher, who had touched the hearts of three generations of pupils

Daniel was eight and Andrew was just 
six when their mother, who was also a teacher, died in 
Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, aged 35.

Mrs
 Maguire was described by a family friend as 'an angel' for the way she 
looked after her nephews on top of all the other commitments in her 
life.

The friend, who lives 
near the modest terraced house in Wigan where Mrs Maguire grew up, paid 
tribute to her as an 'amazing woman' from a 'talented family'.

She said: 'Ann was a truly lovely woman - the kind of person who you never forget even if you only meet her once.

'The whole family - all of Ann's sisters and her brother - were a really great family. They all did very well at school.

'Her sister passed away in very sad circumstances several years ago and Ann came in and took on her two boys.

'It
 was a very difficult time for the family but Ann stepped in and she 
brought them up with her two young girls - and she was a teacher as 
well. She was an angel.'

Trevor
 Glossop, 68, whose daughter Beverley, 45, was previously married to 
Daniel Poole, now 36, said Mrs Maguire was a 'mother figure' for his 
former son-in-law.

He added:
 'She was a lovely woman - kind-hearted and she would do anything for 
anybody. Everything she tried to do, she did with the best intentions.'

Her former brother-in-law Mike Thomas told The Sun: 'Ann took on the two sons and brought them to live with her. She brought them up till they were about 18.

'She had two daughters so her family doubled overnight. It must have been hard work for her with four kids, but she didn't bat an eyelid.'

The
 family friend, who did not want to be named, said Mrs Maguire and her 
siblings were devoted Catholics who all did well in school and were 
well-liked in the community.

'When
 I read the news I didn't realise at first it was her because I didn't 
recognise her married name, but I was shocked and disgusted simply by 
what had happened,' she said.

'When
 I found out it was Ann Connor (her maiden name) I was devastated.' 
Another neighbour said: 'The family were very close, Ann was a lovely 
lady, a really wonderful person, and she would come down to visit James 
(Connor, her younger brother, who still lives in the family home) from 
time to time.

'I hadn't seen her for a few years but when I saw the picture of her in the paper it made my heart wrench.'

Mr
 Connor, 59, could not be reached yesterday (Tue) and neighbours, who 
described him as 'very quiet' and reclusive, said they were worried 
about how he would be affected by his sister's death.

Mrs Maguire's youngest sister Denise Courtney, 48, was too upset to speak at her home in Warrington.
