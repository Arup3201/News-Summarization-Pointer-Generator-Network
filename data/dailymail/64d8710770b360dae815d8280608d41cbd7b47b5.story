Qatada was once described as Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe and even the judges in the Court of Appeal admit he is regarded as a 'very dangerous' man

The British government is to secure fresh assurances from Jordan in an attempt to finally kick hate cleric Abu Qatada out of the country.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today revealed ministers will work ‘flat out’ to deport the radical preacher after the government lost its latest court challenge to have him removed.

Appeal court judges yesterday rejected a 
plea from the UK government to eject Qatada, despite accepting that he 
is ‘very dangerous’.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in Mr Clegg said: ‘No one wants this guy to stay here.'

But his comments appeared at odds with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who last night blamed Lib Dem refusal to change human rights laws for the failure to give the terror suspect the boot.

Mr Grayling said: ‘Labour and the Liberal Democrats’ refusal to contemplate big changes to human rights law is inexplicable given problems like this.

'I am bitterly unhappy that we have to wait until the next general election to sort this out.’

The Court of Appeal ruled that while Qatada’s deportation was ‘long overdue’, his risk to the public was not ‘a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws.

The judges yesterday upheld an earlier verdict that sending the hate preacher to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.

Home Secretary Theresa May will now lodge a last-ditch appeal to the Supreme Court. If that fails, it would raise the prospect of Qatada – variously described as a ‘truly dangerous individual’ and Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe – never being deported. He could apply to be freed within days.

Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium.

Today Mr Clegg said: 'This has been going on for years and 
years, it’s incredibly frustrating, I’m as frustrated as anybody this 
guy shouldn’t be here, he should be deported.

‘I wish we could have deported him years ago never mind over the last few months,’ he told LBC 97.3.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'frustrated' at the delays to Qatada's deportation and said Home Secretary Theresa May would seek new assurances from the Jordanian government

Qatada's removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year.

Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal 
against this verdict.

Instead, she and her ministers 
secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be 
no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in 
the UK legal system. 

But last November, the Special 
Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) said it was not satisfied with the
 assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect
 the Strasbourg ruling.

That decision was yesterday unanimously upheld by Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and two other Appeal Court judges.

Mr Clegg said Mrs May would step up attempts to reach a deal with Jordan that reassures the courts that Qatada will get a fair trial.

He said: ‘It’s been this endless legal ping pong, the European Court interestingly enough actually found against Abu Qatada and said that his appeal against deportation was wrong. 

‘But the courts both here and elsewhere have said that there’s this legal issue about whether the assurances that the Jordanians have given us about how their court system works is kind of sufficiently strong and that’s where the legal argument has got stuck.

‘Theresa May has been out to Jordan, she’s going to work flat out to make sure that we strengthen those assurances from the Jordanians, we are absolutely determined as a government to deport this guy, I wish we could do it earlier.  We have to jump through these endless legal hoops but we will get there.’
