He told Real Madrid's official website: 'I think there can be no doubt about Cristiano for the Ballon d'Or this year. There's no putting money on it.

'All three of our forwards were fantastic. Cristiano and Benzema scored but Bale made assists and worked hard. It's essential to work together. The midfield was good too.'

The Madrid star won the coveted award for the second time in 2013 after winning it in 2008
