With her plaited blonde hair, dazzling designer gown and toned, bronzed figure, Joanne Froggatt — the one-time Plain Jane of Soapland — looked like an entirely different person at the Golden Globes this week.

After almost two decades of acting, Froggatt has become a familiar face on our TV screens. It’s just not a face associated with Hollywood glamour.

Instead, the British actress has made her name playing dowdy TV roles, from dinner lady to prison inmate.

So watching her this week collecting the best supporting actress in a TV drama award, for her portrayal of Downton Abbey rape victim Anna, the transformation was incredible. The 34-year-old looked completely at home among Hollywood’s finest as she gave a gracious acceptance speech.

Could it be that she will be the one of the very small handful of British former soap stars to successfully carve out a career in Hollywood? If she doesn’t, it certainly won’t be for the want of trying.

So just how has the 5ft 2in Yorkshire-born girl transformed herself from Britain’s average Jo(anne) into a Hollywood princess?

The answer is a clever campaign involving a hugely expensive stylist and crack PR team. Plus, the personal grittiness to succeed that she has shown since aged 11.

There was nothing accidental about her perfect grooming at the Globes. Behind this transformation is the outrageously outgoing Brad Goreski, a stylist to the stars.

Joanne’s embellished Marchesa dress — worth north of £5,500 — was his choice, and he is apparently now picking out her outfit for the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Goreski’s clients include global stars Jessica Alba, Demi Moore and Christina Ricci — and his services do not come cheap. A ballpark estimate for his personal services at a Hollywood event is up to £10,000.

Pictured left in 1996 on The Bill as a fresh-faced ingénue, Frogatt was 15 when she landed a role in The Bill as an underage prostitute. Right, she is pictured in 1997-98 on Coronation Street as single mum Zoe Tattersall

Here she is pictured left in 1999 in the series Bad Girls, as plain prison inmate Rachel Hicks, who took her own life during the first series. Pictured right in 1999 in Dinnerladies, she is distinctly dowdy in a cameo role in the Victoria Wood sitcom, appearing as work experience girl Sigourney

Left in 2000 she is pictured in Lorna Doone as mousy Lizzie Ridd in the BBC adaptation of R. D. Blackmore’s novel. Pictured right in 2001 and acting opposite David Jason in A Touch Of Frost, Joanne looks a little more glamorous with her short bob and make-up

For this, a stylist will secure the loan of a dress, or dresses, plus sourcing a suite of matching jewellery and arranging the right hair and make-up. In Joanne’s case, rising hair stylist Ashley Streicher created her messy plaited up-do for the Golden Globes.

But make no mistake, Joanne did not come across these style gurus by luck. They will have been handpicked by her seasoned Hollywood personal publicists at ID PR. They arranged for her to attend all of the better pre-Globes parties, including an ‘It girls’ lunch hosted by fashion magazine W, along with Kim Kardashian.

She has come a long way. Born in Littlebeck, Yorkshire, to Annie and Keith Froggatt, who ran a corner shop before moving to a smallholding near Whitby, Joanne grew up on a rare-breed sheep farm.

‘My parents always taught me and my brother Daniel to be open-minded and go for the things we want.’

At 11, she joined a local drama group in Scarborough and eventually got the funding for a boarding place at Redroofs theatre school in Berkshire, aged 14.

Left, she is pictured in 2006 in Life on Mars: With a girl-next-door prettiness, Joanne played Ruth Tyler, the mother of time-traveller Sam. Right, in 2006, she was compelling as Maureen Smith, sister of killer Myra Hindley (Maxine Peake, left), in the Bafta-winning drama See No Evil: The Moors Murders

In 2007 she starred in Murder In The Outback (left), in which her low-level beauty let her nail the real-life Joanne Lees. And right, in 2008, she looked prim in another Plain Jane casting, this time as field office leader Hannah in Spooks: Code 9

She made her television debut at 15, playing an underage prostitute in The Bill. But she had to leave drama school after her GCSEs as funding dried up.

She was working full-time in WHSmith when a casting director from Granada got in touch about an opening in Coronation Street. What was meant to be four days’ work in 1997 turned into 18 months.

Her character Zoe Tattersall — a teenage single mum who sold her baby and stole it back before the infant died of meningitis while she was out clubbing — set the tone for her future typecasting.

After Corrie, came a string of roles perfectly suited to her everyday look — prison drama Bad Girls in 1999, then dinnerladies with Victoria Wood and parts in A Touch Of Frost and Spooks.

In See No Evil: The Moors Murders, her portrayal of Myra Hindley’s sister Maureen Smith was a triumph, and the show nabbed a Bafta. Her role in Army drama In Our Name in 2010 won Joanne Best Newcomer at the British Independent Film Awards.

In 2009 she starred in Robin Hood (left) in a sexier role when she joined the BBC’s much-hyped adaptation in its third series as villager Kate. Right, in 2010, in the film In Our Name, playing a traumatised private returning from Iraq which won her Best Newcomer at the British Independent Film Awards

Pictured left in 2010 in the Royle Family Christmas special - this time looking pretty and radiant as Anthony’s girlfriend Saskia. Right, in 2010-2015 in  Downton Abbey as a rape victim, accused of murder — housemaid Anna is another unglamorous role, but it has finally made Joanne a global star

Froggatt had established herself as the go-to actress for gritty, realistic characters,

As Anna the maid in Downton Abbey, she received Emmy nominations in 2012 and 2014. But while her style on camera remained dowdy and demure, on the red carpet Froggatt began to flourish. And the grit that saw her propel herself from a Yorkshire farm to Britain’s biggest drama series is about to take her to Hollywood, too. She and husband James Cannon, a software programmer, plan to move to LA in August so she can meet film and TV executives in person.

But Froggatt understands — despite her Hollywood makeover — where her skills lie.

‘I’m not classically beautiful. I always play girls who are traumatised, or a plain girl. I’ve played really interesting characters — but I couldn’t compete with Julia Roberts.’

Yet on Sunday night, when she swung confidently into the HBO party after the Golden Globes then on to the night’s starriest gathering, the Weinstein Company bash, she looked every bit the Hollywood film star.

Julia Roberts better watch out.
