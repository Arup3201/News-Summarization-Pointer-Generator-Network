They say the customer is always right.

But not many can claim to being so right they forced a supermarket to change one of its products.

Little Lily Robinson can, however, after the three-year-old got Sainsbury's to rename its tiger bread after writing a letter saying it looked more like the markings of a giraffe.

Consumer power: Loaves of the newly-named giraffe bread went on sale in Sainsbury's yesterday

Lily, who gave her age as '3½', fired off her comments to the company last May suggesting the name be altered.

She received a reply two weeks later from customer manager Chris King who wrote: ‘I think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea.

‘It looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger, doesn’t it?’

Misnomer moan: Lily Robinson's letter to Sainsbury's asking why tiger bread wasn't called giraffe bread

Understanding: This witty and friendly reply from Customer Manager Chris King won him a lot of praise

Viral: Lily's mother posted her daughter's letter and the response on this Facebook campaign page which went on to get more than 140,000 'likes'

He went on to explain that the bread had got its name because the first baker who made it a ‘looong time ago thought it looked stripey like a tiger.’

'Maybe they were a bit silly,’ he added before signing off with his age ’27 1/3’, just as Lily did.

The girl’s letter and the supermarket’s reply has now gone viral eight months later with over 150,000 ‘likes’ on Facebook after her mother posted them online.

Sainsbury’s last night said it had given in to popular demand and started selling the new loaves from yesterday.

What do you think? A look at these images makes it hard to disagree with Lily

A spokesman said: ‘In response to overwhelming customer feedback that our tiger bread has more resemblance to a giraffe, from today we will be changing our tiger bread to giraffe bread and seeing how that goes.’

The supermarket said that Mr King, who has been widely praised by Twitter and Facebook users for his impressive reply, has left the company and is training as a primary school teacher.

Tiger bread is typically made by brushing a rice paste onto the surface of a bloomer loaf prior to baking, with the pattern forming as the paste dries and cracks.
