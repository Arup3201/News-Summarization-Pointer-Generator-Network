Police are searching for a missing 11-year-old patient whose life is at risk after her mother removed her from hospital in the middle of Leukemia treatment.

The girl called Emily had her arm amputated because of an infection and a chest catheter placed into her heart as doctors treated her for the potentially lethal disease.

But her mother removed an IV drip from the catheter, changed the child's clothes and then walked her poorly 11-year-old daughter out of her ward at Phoenix Children's Hospital.

Last sighting: Leukemia patient Emily is seen with her mother on Phoenix Children's Hospital CCTV

Putting a stop to treatment: Emily's mother removed a IV drip from a catheter in her heart and helped her change clothes before leading her out of the hospital

CCTV footage shows the pair then left the building before driving off in a black Ford van on Wednesday night.

Doctors are now worried that the child, who was due to officially leave hospital today, could die in just a few days from an infection of her heart if the catheter is not medically removed.

Detectives have searched locally and outside the state for the girl and her mother believed to be named Norma.

Leaving early: The 11-year-old, pictured with her mother and a young boy, was not to leave hospital until later this week

Concerns: Doctors are worried Emily could die from an infection of the heart within a few days if the catheter is not medically removed

Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Steve Martos said: 'We have been informed by medical personnel if the catheter is not medically removed the victim’s heart could potentially become infected resulting in the child’s death.

'It is imperative anyone with information as to the whereabouts of these individuals contact Phoenix police.

'The primary concern of our detectives is the welfare of the 11-year-old victim.'

Missing: The group left the hospital in a black Ford on Wednesday night and Emily hasn't been seen since
