Simon Butler, pictured, from Surrey believes his prosecution by French authorities was a 'racist vendetta' claiming that his British skiing qualification should allow him to teach in France.

A ski instructor from Surrey has been fined €30,000 (£24,000) for teaching illegally in the Alps after French authorities refused to recognise his British qualifications.

Simon Butler, 51, said he had been subjected to a 'racist vendetta' and launched an immediate appeal.

He was supported by Mayor of London Boris Johnson who accused the French of a 'naked' breach of the European single market.

Mr Butler was warned by the court in Bonneville, Haute-Savoie, that if he failed to pay the fine he would face spending 200 days in prison.

Mr Butler, from Guildford, Surrey, has been teaching clients how to ski in the French Alps for 32 years.

Despite having the highest-rated British ski instructor’s licence, Mr Butler has refused to obtain qualifications required to teach in France.

He says France's refusal to recognise British certificates violates EU laws on freedom of movement, in particular a 2005 directive on Europe-wide recognition of qualifications.

Speaking after the today's ruling he said: 'Obviously I'm very disappointed with that result.

'As far as I'm concerned I'm not guilty of anything. I believe I have done everything in my power to prove that my British ski qualifications are in order and that I absolutely have the right to teach skiing in France.

'This has been nothing but a racist vendetta to get me out.'

Mr Butler said he had been victimised for years by rival French ski instructors.

He said: 'I have run a successful business out here and the local ski instructors don't like it because they believe I'm taking clients from them.'

The row centres over the fact that Mr Butler qualified before the introduction of a controversial rule that all non-French teachers had to pass the 'Eurotest', a timed high-speed slalom run, in order to work in France.

The French authorities introduced the test in 2004. Mr Butler insists his qualifications, which he achieved in 1985, are the equivalent of this test.

The trial has sparked consternation in Britain.

London Mayor Boris Johnson called the dispute 'a complete, naked, shameless and unrepentant breach -- by the French -- of the principles of the European Single Market'.

This prompted the French embassy in London to deny there was a 'piste war' taking place in the French Alps.

The sentence comes after Mr Butler was arrested on a chairlift in Megeve in February. He was escorted off the piste by police and held in custody for 36 hours.

Mr Butler employs 28 people and hosts about 100 guests a week from December to April in the resort of Megeve

The court also fined his six fellow British instructors who work with him in Megeve between €1,000 to €4,000 for teaching illegally.
