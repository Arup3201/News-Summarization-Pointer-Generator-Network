Sunderland have still not given up hope on signing Fabio Borini – despite waiting five weeks for an answer from the Liverpool forward.

The Black Cats tabled a £14million bid for their former loanee in mid-July and the offer was duly accepted by the Reds.

Borini, however, is still to decide on where his future lies and Sunderland have yet to sign a striker this summer.

Decision time: Borini has still not chosen whether he will join Sunderland despite a bid being accepted

Waiting game: For now Borini continues to train with Liverpool but seems unlikely to stay at Anfield

Boss Gus Poyet, however, is prepared to wait for the Italian, despite a reported deadline of last Monday.

‘We’re still going and we’re still trying,’ he said. ‘Nothing has changed, for good or for bad.’

Sportsmail understands Borini is weighing up his options before giving Poyet an answer, and another loan move could yet emerge as a possibility.

Meanwhile, Sunderland take on Manchester United on Sunday at the Stadium of Light.

Strike: Lee Cattermole will keep his place against Manchester United after a stunning goal last week

Joy: Cattermole's fine performances are keeping January signing Liam Bridcutt out of the Sunderland side

Lee Cattermole – scorer of a stunning goal during last week’s 2-2 draw with West Brom – will again anchor the midfield in place of January signing Liam Bridcutt, and Poyet added: ‘Lee is an example of how football works. When I bought Liam everyone thought he would be first choice.

‘But Liam isn’t playing because of himself, it’s because of Lee Cattermole and the form he is in. At this moment in time Lee is a key player for us.

‘Lee was always asking questions and listening and putting the effort in.’
