Spot the mistake: Using old maps before a hospital was built, idiotic workers painted these yellow lines in Cumbria

A council has admitted making a 'ridiculous' mistake after it put double yellow lines across a busy T-junction.

Bungling workers painted a no-parking zone outside Workington Community Hospital in Cumbria because they were using maps from before it was built.

Baffled drivers say the situation is an 'embarrassment' and a 'waste of 
cash' because Cumbria County Council will have to get them removed.

'Never in all my life have I seen anything so stupid - I just really couldn't believe it,' local man Bryan Allred said.

'It
looks like a child had done it it is that poor - maybe the painter was 
under the influence or suffering from the fumes given off the paint.'

Taxi driver Ray Cottier said he's been driving around Workington since he was 17 and he's never come across anything as peculiar.

'The lines have gone right across the junction - I've never seen anything like it before,' he said.

Colleague Ian Melville said: 'It's ridiculous. You can't paint double yellow lines across the entrance of a hospital - what on earth were they thinking?'

A Cumbria County Council spokesman admitted it was an error but it could be weeks until they are removed.

'Prior to the hospital's construction double yellow lines ran across where access to the hospital is now located.

Bizarre: Drivers have called the mistake outside Workington Community Hospital 'the most stupid thing we've ever seen'

'During routine highway maintenance it seems a plan was used showing the markings as they were previously and unfortunately the external lining contractor mistakenly re-installed the old lines.

'It was a genuine mistake and we apologise for any confusion it may have caused.

'The markings will be rectified when the lining gang is next in the area - hopefully within the next few weeks.'
