A 100-year-old woman who has lived in the same one-bedroom New York apartment for almost 50 year has been served with an eviction notice.

The New York City Housing Authority claims that Concetta Passione, who celebrated her century on Sunday, has been unlawfully residing in Italy and therefore shouldn't be allowed to keep her $219 a month apartment.

Passione and her late husband and two sons were amongst the first people to move into Rutgers Houses in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in 1964.

The New York City Housing Authority claims that Concetta Passione, right, who celebrated her century on Sunday, has been unlawfully residing in Italy and therefore shouldn't be allowed to keep her $219 a month apartment in which her son Sebastian, left, also lives

‘I want to be here,’ Passione told The New York Daily News, with her 73-year-old son, Sebastian, acting as her interpreter because she only speaks Italian.

‘I will never get used to any place else. I’m the first one to come here and now they want to throw me out? It’s not right.’ 

Although her husband died years ago, Passione’s two sons have lived with her at different times.

When her son Paul moved out in 2004, her other son Sebastian, now 73, moved in and he says he pressed NYCHA’s managers to have the lease changed to have his brothers name replaced with his.

‘I provided all the information, all the documentation they wanted and I’m still waiting for them to allow me to be put on the lease. It never happened,’ he told PIX11.

Acting on a tip, the Department of Investigation began investigating Passione and claim that from 2000 to 2009, the great grandmother and her son lived in Italy, returning to New York once a year at Christmas.

They also claims that she currently lives in Italy and allows her son use of the apartment in breach of rules and regulations.

Sebastian, a translator for Social Security, says his mom has made some long trips to Italy, but this is her home.

'All you have to do is come up to the eighth floor knock on the door and you’ll see her,' Sebastian said.

Scott Loffredo is the family’s attorney. 'If Mr. Passione was on the lease, the family composition would have been recalculated, and the rent would’ve increased,' Loffredo said. 'He’s been asking to be on that lease since 2004.'

In 2011, NYCHA sent Passione termination papers, but didn't serve her with an eviction notice until last month.
