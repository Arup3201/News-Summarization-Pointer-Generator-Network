Victor Wanyama believes Southampton's owners should have tried harder to keep manager Mauricio Pochettino, with the midfielder conceding his departure to Tottenham is a 'big blow'.

After months of speculation Pochettino signed a five-year deal to 
become head coach at Spurs, taking his backroom staff with him.

The former Argentina defender's stock rose markedly during his 16-month reign at Saints, whom he led to their best-ever Premier League finish of eighth last season.

The move raises questions over Southampton's 
future direction and has disappointed midfielder Wanyama, who moved to 
St Mary's from Scottish champions Celtic last summer in a Â£12.5million deal.

'I learnt a lot from him, he taught me more and that's why I have grown as a player and there is a big difference compared to when I was at Celtic,' the 22-year-old Kenyan told Capital Sport.

'He played a big role in my career development.

'I wanted him to remain because he had the passion for the club and I think the owners should not have let him go because the team can do better next season.

'It's a big blow because he had good connection with the players.'

Pochettino's exit raises questions over 
the future of several Southampton stars - such as Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana - whom Wanyama hopes stay so they 'can build a successful team 
together at Southampton'.

Teenager Shaw is currently away with England's World Cup squad but he took time out to tweet thanks to the departing Saints manager.

'Would like to thank Mauricio For everything he has done for me,' the 18-year-old said.

'Great manager, great guy and has helped me a lot. Wish him all the best.'
