Gary Lineker thought it might be time to make it a Bank Holiday and for a while it seemed like the usual movers and shakers had decided to take deadline day off.

There were revelations from Juan Mata that Anderson had returned to Brazil and an outburst from Davide Santon’s girlfriend, who claimed they had been forced out of Newcastle as the Italian full back rejoined Inter Milan, but it was a slow start to business.

Robert Huth arrived at Leicester with a blank stare and a black bin-liner and the cogs were greased and started to whirl.

Chelsea's signing of World Cup star Juan Cuadrado was the biggest deal of transfer deadline day

Chelsea added Colombia World Cup star Juan Cuadrado to their squad for £27million, the biggest deal of the month, just ahead of Wilfried Bony’s transfer from Swansea to Manchester City.

West Bromwich really got the momentum rolling in the Premier League market as manager Tony Pulis and chairman Jeremy Peace created space in the squad by finding homes for unwanted players.

Among them, Graham Dorrans, who began the day as a Burnley target, seemed to be heading to Norwich. Albion were keen to take left back Martin Olsson in return but the clubs could not get that deal over the line.

Having missed Dorrans, Burnley bid £3m for Nottingham Forest’s Henri Lansbury but could not convince boss Dougie Freedman to agree on his first day in the job at the City Ground, even though Forest were desperate for the money.

Albion’s Brown Ideye was pursued by Al Gharafa of Qatar, for £3.8m, a significant loss on their £10m club-record signing, but that deal also fell through.

Pulis had hoped for a day akin to last January when he bagged four deadline signings at Crystal Palace. This time he needed an extention to push through their deal for Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, but a move for West Ham’s Carlton Cole also collapsed late on.

Darren Fletcher's move from Manchester United was one of the few deals West Brom managed to complete

Georgios Samaras, who joined Albion for free on a two-year deal in August, was last night heading to Saudi Arabia after failing to start a game. West Brom epitomised what has become a self-sustaining cycle of spending, where time and energy are burned desperately trying to sell the expensive errors of judgment from previous windows. All under the pressure of a ticking clock and financial fair play.

‘It is the poker room of last resort,’ according to former Hull chairman Paul Duffen on BBC Radio 5 Live.Yet again, someone at Southampton was devoting time to finding a home for Dani Osvaldo, who had fallen out with Roberto Mancini during a loan at Inter Milan. When a proposed move back to Juventus collapsed, he emerged as a viable alternative for any team seeking a high-maintenance striker but unable to afford Emmanuel Adebayor.

Tottenham tore up Benoit Assou-Ekotto’s £40,000-a-week contract, tried unsuccessfully to loan Younes Kaboul to Roma and found Aaron Lennon was reluctant to be rushed out. Stoke, Hull, Leicester and QPR all failed before Everton tempted him to Merseyside.

Goodison boss Roberto Martinez said: ‘Aaron represents a real boost in terms of attacking options. His pace and trickery will fit in well.’ 

QPR decided they would like Matt Jarvis, rather than Mauro Zarate, from West Ham but the deal collapsed. Tom Ince travelled from Hull to Derby and sealed a move to his fifth club in little more than a year. A promising career has lost its way in this blur of money.

Other clubs worked hard to hold on to their players, like Swansea with Bafetimbi Gomis, who, after a month of discontent, confirmed he would stay. For now. ‘Even if I was sad before, because I didn’t play a lot, now everything is different,’ Gomis said on Twitter. ‘I believe in this team and this project.’

Burnley’s Danny Ings also went on Twitter to reveal he was watching American Sniper. He was a movie-goer not a mover, at least not yet. After an impressive debut season in the Premier League, Ings will clinch a good move when his contract expires in the summer. Liverpool and Real Sociedad are interested.

Manchester United swallowed a loss of millions on Wilfried Zaha, signed two years ago from Palace for £15m and loaned back to help them win promotion. At the time, Arsenal and Spurs wanted the winger, who has returned to Selhurst Park for just £6m.

English clubs were committed to a total of £80m of spending at start of play, £15m down on the same point last year, when another £35m was spent on deadline day.

Wilfried Zaha ended his Manchester United nightmare by returning to Crystal Palace for a knockdown fee 

Tottenham have invested for the future with a deal for MK Dons  wonderkid Dele Alli

Monday's figures were boosted by the Cuadrado deal. Chelsea took care to stay within FFP limits with the £24m sale of Andre Schurrle to Wolfsburg and a loan fee for Mohamed Salah, who joined Fiorentina. Salah arrived at Chelsea from Basle 12 months ago in what looks increasingly a signing designed to stop him joining title rivals Liverpool. Jose Mourinho never warmed to his style.

Tottenham invested £5m in Dele Alli from MK Dons, heading off Newcastle and Aston Villa. Bournemouth tried to dazzle Birmingham with a £5m bid for Demarai Gray, but without success.

Down the divisions, Sheffield Wednesday were active, Cardiff paid Chesterfield a seven-figure fee for Eoin Doyle, League One’s top scorer, and Yakubu is back. The Nigerian represented five English clubs in nine years before leaving Blackburn, three years ago. Now he is back, via China and Qatar, signing for Reading and still only 32. ‘The Yak is ready to go,’ he beamed from Berkshire.
