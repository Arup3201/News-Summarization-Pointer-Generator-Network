A man who bit a dog during an altercation outside a corner shop later ran inside and died from a suspected heart attack after 'being restrained', it has emerged.

The man, who is in his forties, bit the dog – believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – during a dispute with a 45-year-old man in Cambridge.

He then ran into a nearby One Stop convenience shop, reportedly in his socks, and died a short time later, after allegedly being held by four men.

Police and paramedics were called to the store following the incident at about 6.30am on Monday, having received reports of a man in cardiac arrest.

The man, who is believed to live in the area but has not yet been formally identified, was pronounced dead a short time later.

A post mortem examination to determine his cause of death proved inconclusive, police said.

Further tests will now be carried out at Peterborough City Hospital, including a toxicology test.

Four men, aged 40, 44, 69, and 50, from  Cambridgeshire, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death. They have since been released on bail until February 11.

A 45-year-old man, who was allegedly involved in the original dispute outside the shop, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm but has since been released without charge. Police said no further action would be taken.

Witnesses to the incident described seeing two men 'shouting and struggling' in the street, prior to the man's death.

Samantha Lander, a resident on Dudley Road, told Cambridge News that she was awoken by the sound of shouting and looked out of the window to see a struggle, which appeared to involve a dog that looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier.

It is believed the man who died had run off into the shop following the dispute and was being restrained by four men in the store when he became unwell.

East of England Ambulance Service confirmed a rapid response car, ambulance and an air ambulance were sent to the scene after receiving reports of a man having a cardiac arrest. 

A spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.51am on Monday and were on scene in seven minutes.

'Unfortunately despite the best efforts of everyone involved a male patient sadly died at the scene.'

The spokesman confirmed paramedics performed CPR on the patient.   

Police said they received reports that the man had bit a dog outside the convenience store in Cambridge (pictured) during the dispute and later ran off into the store, where he passed away a short time later

Cambridgeshire Constabulary said the man's death was being treated as 'unexplained' but confirmed it was not deemed to be suspicious.

A spokesman said: 'The death of a man on December 15 in Cambridge is being treated as unexplained by police.

'The man, who is in his 40s and from Cambridge, died after police were called to an incident at a premises in Ditton Lane at just after 6.30am.

'The man who died bit the dog belonging to the 45-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and has now been released with no further action. 

'Four men arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death have been released on police bail.' 

The One Stop shop was closed for some time following the incident, but it was reopened at 7am today.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident at our store in Ditton Lane, Cambridge. We are helping the police with their investigation.'
