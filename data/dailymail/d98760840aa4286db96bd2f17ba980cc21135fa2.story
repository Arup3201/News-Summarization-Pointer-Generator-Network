An eight-year-old girl has died after contracting an E. coli infection but health officials have stressed it is not part of an outbreak.

The child was from East Ayrshire in Scotland and had contracted the  E. coli O157 strain.

She was treated in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow but sadly died.

NHS Ayrshire and Arran said it has not identified the source of the infection but it does not believe the case is part of an outbreak.

Dr Jane Cooper, consultant in public health medicine said: 'Our thoughts are with the family during this very difficult time.

'Sometimes it is possible to identify a particular source of E.coli O157 infection. An outbreak may occur if a number of people are exposed to the same source.

'NHS Ayrshire & Arran is satisfied that this case is not part of an outbreak, and has not identified a particular source which might represent a risk to others.

'E. coli O157 infection is very easily picked up and sometimes investigations cannot identify either a particular source, or any way in which the risk of infection could have been avoided.'

Symptoms normally develop after ingesting contaminated foods or liquids or having been in contact with infected animals.

Infected cases often develop a fever leading to sickness and diarrhoea.

The health board has issued precautions which can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, including washing hands after contact with possible sources such as raw food and milk and animal faeces.

The girl's death comes after another case of Legionnaires’ disease has been confirmed in Stoke-on-Trent following an outbreak in the city thought to be linked to a hot tub.

The Health Protection Agency said the latest case brings the total to 21.

The patient, who is being treated at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, is a man in his 70s.

Two patients being treated for the disease since the spate of illnesses began in the middle of July have died.

An HPA spokeswoman said: 'This new case is not unexpected.

'It can take up to two weeks following exposure for people to develop symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease and a further few days before they might see their GP.'

A spokesman for University Hospital of North Staffordshire said: 'Three patients remain in hospital and all are in a stable or improving condition.'

It was revealed earlier this month that the probable cause of the outbreak was a hot tub at JTF Warehouse in the city after samples were found to have an unusual strain of legionella bacteria, which matched that of the strain taken from patients with the illness.

Dr Sue Ibbotson, regional director of HPA West Midlands, said the organisation has taken detailed histories from those with Legionnaires’ and the majority of confirmed cases visited the warehouse in the two weeks before they fell ill.

The samples from the hot tub at JTF Warehouse in City Road, Fenton, were confirmed by the Health Protection Agency’s specialist laboratory in Colindale as being the unusual strain legionella bacteria.
