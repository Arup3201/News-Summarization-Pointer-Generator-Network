A 29-year-old teacher has been accused of having sex with three of her students on the same night.

Ellen Niemiec is alleged to have romped with the students during a house party last month.

Families of her victims were in court to see the married mother of three face charges of sexual battery with a student.

While the charges relate to a single night, the attorney for the victims said there were multiple acts. He also said they took place away from the school but also on the school campus.

'It started off with kind of sexual talk and it ended up dirty talk and then it ended up texting pictures and it's our understanding that this teacher had, would have sexual talks with her class on numerous occasions,' said Mike Bosnak.

'And it escalated from that into, you know, actual physical, the physical part of this.'

Niemiec, from Summerville, South Carolina, taught at Cross High school.

She is alleged to have sex with the three students on April 11th.

The incident was reported to school staff and police called in to investigate.

Arrest warrants were issued and she turned herself in at the sheriff's office Thursday.

Berkeley County Magistrate James Polk set her bail at $21,092 during a Thursday night hearing.

He also told her to stay out of Cross and have no contact with the high school students there.

Berkeley County Detective Brian Fenton read a statement stressing the seriousness of the charges.

'She was entrusted with educating and keeping her students safe,' Fenton said.

Gone: Niemiec was placed on administrative leave when the allegations surfaced and she is no longer employed at Cross High

'That's the trust she violated. The Cross community is a very tight-knit, small community. In small communities the school is the center of the community. When a teacher violates her students' trust, she essentially violates the whole community's trust.'

Her attorney David Aylor told the Post and Courier newspaper he didn't have a chance to talk with Niemiec.

'Obviously, this is the very beginning of the case,' he said. 'This is obviously extremely difficult for her and her family.'

Niemiec was placed on administrative leave when the allegations surfaced and she is no longer employed at Cross High, the Berkeley County School District said in a statement.

'The safety of all students is the top priority of the Berkeley County School District,' said the district. 'Under no circumstances does the Berkeley County School District condone or tolerate any inappropriate conduct between its employees and students.'
