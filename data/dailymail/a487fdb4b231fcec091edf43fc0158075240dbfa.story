Social networks are rife with people taking selfies, but there's a knack to getting the photo right so it doesn't feature your forearm, or isn't taken in a toilet mirror.

To solve this first world problem, a company has created the Smartphone Remote Control that syncs with an app and lets people take photos of themselves from 10 feet away.

A stand even positions the phone at the correct angle, in both portrait and landscape modes, spelling the end of shaky photos and trying to balance the phone and press the shutter at the same time.

The Smartphone Camera Remote, pictured, costs £14.99 and includes a stand that rests the handset at the perfect angle in both portrait and landscape. The wireless range is quoted as 10 feet, although tests have shown it can work at more than three times this distance

Wireless range: 10 feet - although tests have shown it can work up to 32 feet

Controls: Top button takes the photo, bottom button switches between front- and rear-facing cameras 

Battery:  x CR2032 battery (included)

Extras: Stand supports the phone and can be used in  portrait and landscape orientation

Dimensions: 2.7in x 1.1in x 0.7in

The handheld control costs £14.99 and syncs with a free iOS smartphone app.

Users position their phone, using the stand, on a flat surface.

To take a photo, users click the top button on the remote. The bottom button lets a user switch between front- and back-facing cameras.

The remote control connects with the app wirelessly over Bluetooth, so doesn't need to be pointed directly at the device.

This also means photos can be taken inconspicuously.

Its maker claims it has a range of 10 feet, although tests by retailer Firebox managed to take selfies from 32 feet away.

Ben Redhead, from Firebox.com, said: 'The recent rise in popularity of the 'selfie' makes it quick and easy to capture that self-absorbed snapshot.

To take a photo, users simply click the top button on the remote, pictured left. The bottom button lets a user switch between front- and back-facing cameras. The stand, pictured right, supports the phone meaning it can be used in portrait and landscape mode on a flat surface

'Unfortunately, selfies are notoriously difficult to achieve that high-quality shot you originally hoped for.

'Not to mention how ridiculous you look to passers-by when holding your smartphone less than 12 inches away from your face as you pout awkwardly.

'The Smartphone Camera Remote not only makes your selfie look more professional, it allows you to be more discreet whilst you're taking that incredibly vain picture of you and your surroundings.'

The control is  2.7in x 1.1in x 0.7in and takes a CR2032 battery.
