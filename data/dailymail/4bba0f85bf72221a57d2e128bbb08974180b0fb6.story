Paul Murray has urged Rangers fans to take destiny into their own hands by throwing their financial muscle behind one of two fan ownership schemes.

Murray, who together with Dave King and John Gilligan, is seeking a place on the Ibrox board at a forthcoming Extraordinary General Meeting, has taken out life membership of both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First.

With the Trust enjoying contributions from over 3,000 members and Rangers First members now numbering 4200, the prospect of fans holding the balance of power in determining boardroom change is growing by the day.

And, with the current incumbents fighting for survival at the EGM, the former Ibrox director is imploring each disgruntled supporter to vote with their pocket by joining the growing number seeking meaningful change via the mass purchase of shares.

A statement on behalf of Murray read: ‘I have today taken out life membership of both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First. Whilst I would like to make special mention of the RST, who have supported our cause tirelessly over the last few years, I wish to make it known that I fully support these two groups in their desire to help safeguard the future of our club.

‘Along with many of the people who have been working behind the scenes to ensure Rangers can again function fully, both on and off the pitch, I believe the supporters should be able to participate significantly in the club’s rehabilitation.

‘Dave King, John Gilligan and I are committed to introducing meaningful fan ownership and representation at the club and that is one of the reasons I have pledged my support to both groups.

‘RST and Rangers First have bought not insignificant amounts of shares and must be recognised by those of us who are striving to remove the current Directors and begin the process of repairing the considerable damage caused by a constantly changing Boardroom.

‘The Club and not the needs of individuals must be put back to the top of the priority list and the supporters can help us achieve that goal. Rangers First and RST will always have the best interests of their club at heart and they deserve as much support as we can give.

‘I would urge as many of this club’s fans to sign up to either one or both if possible. The fans can play a hugely significant part in forcing change through votes.

‘They are the most loyal supporters any club could wish for but have been disregarded by a succession of directors in recent years, and I for one recognise their contribution in the struggle to end the disgrace and level of mismanagement within Ibrox.

‘There is now a demand for a General Meeting and our fans can make a difference in that process, which hopefully will bring about the changes necessary. We have seen what happens when Directors with no feel, no understanding and no real concern for Rangers are in control.’

No date has yet been set for the EGM which ordinarily must be called within 42 days.

The board has stated it plans to resist the requisition on the grounds that King isn’t fit to be a director due to his convictions for contravening South African income tax law.

Rangers have been sent into further disarray following the resignation of caretaker boss Kenny McDowall

Murray, though, says the wider fan-base must be prepared to stand strong in the face of a war of words that’s only going to intensify.

‘In the lead up to the General Meeting the usual suspects will attempt to undermine our cause because they realise their days could be numbered,’ the statement went on.

‘The truth is that for the first time in years there is a group of people capable of rebuilding and repairing our club and malicious speculation will not deflect us.

‘Rangers have to re-engage with Scottish football and take our place again at the top table.

‘We need to be financially stable again and accept our responsibilities to the game in general. Change will come and we can all emerge from a black period in this fantastic club’s history.’
