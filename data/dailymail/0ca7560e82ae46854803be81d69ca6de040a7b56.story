Roughly 30 kilometres southeast of Brisbane sits a café with a scandalous burger.

But the chefs at Fins n Fries café in North Stradbroke Island say their Bali Nine Burger is only named after its ingredients.

The café has been serving the item for over four years, but they conceded the looming execution of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has prompted questions about the burgers future, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

Owner and head chef Cameron Tobin said customers are asking: ''are you going to call it the Bali Seven in a couple of weeks time?''

Mr Tobin clarified he thought this suggestion was 'distasteful.' He claimed the burger earned its name from having nine ingredients and a Balinese sauce, rather than referencing the nine people arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle eight kilograms of heroin into Australia.

'People have a bit of a laugh, but then I explain to them the theory behind it and tell them that there are nine ingredients on the burger,' he said.

Mr Tobin discovered the recipe for the burger when travelling through southeast Asia.

While it is apparently his most popular item, that could be in part due to some customers believing it contains drugs.

'It is my best seller, but I get lots of people ask me if there are illicit products used in the making of the burger,' he said.

Instead, the nine ingredients are lettuce, sweet chilli, fried shallots, bean sprouts, cheese bacon, chicken-devilled pattie, Balinese satay sauce and a bun.

It comes as news broke on Thursday the legal appeals of Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been adjourned until next week, because president Joko Widodo lacks sufficient legal representation.
