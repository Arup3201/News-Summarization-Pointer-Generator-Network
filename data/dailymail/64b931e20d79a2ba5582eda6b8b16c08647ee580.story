A former intelligence officer under 
Saddam Hussein was jailed today for 15 years along with a law 
firm worker for raping a teenage boy in the toilets of a city 
centre department store.

Abdelkader
El-Janabi, 55, and Alex Wilson-Fletcher, 42, abducted their 14-year-old
victim in Manchester's Arndale Centre on a busy Saturday afternoon last
summer.

The youngster tried to run off but was caught after feeling cornered by the two men.

They then marched him to the toilets of a nearby Debenhams store where they carried out a horrific  'sustained attack' on him.

In the run up to the assault, Eljanabi told the victim: 'come with us, you're going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you.'

After the assault, the victim was so frightened of catching a bus home in case the pair followed, he walked almost seven miles to a friend's house to confide about his ordeal.

Police were called after the boy's mother found out about the incident.

The boy, now 15, has been left 'absolutely devastated' by his ordeal. He took a drink and drugs overdose 
two months after the rape, and now has difficulty sleeping and suffers 
panic attacks if he goes into public toilets.

Eljanabi and Wilson Fletcher ,who worked 
as a finance officer for a Liverpool law firm, were trapped after police 
issued CCTV of the rapists as part of a nationwide public appeal for 
help.

At Manchester 
Crown Court today, El-Janabi, of Longsight and Wilson-Fletcher, of Ardwick, were found guilty of rape and sexual assault by unanimous verdicts following a trial last month.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Leeming told them: 'There's no indication of any remorse, empathy or insight from you.

'This
attack will stay with this boy for a long time. He took an overdose of 
pills and alcohol describing it as a cry for help because he didn't have
anyone to speak to.

'He's
depressed and has difficulty sleeping. He experiences panic attacks in 
public toilets. He received counselling and expects to do so for a long 
time.'

It emerged El-Janabi had
been seen 'hanging around' the third floor toilets at the four storey 
Debenhams store on numerous occasions by staff, and had on one occasion 
been escorted off the premises.

Wilson-Fletcher handed himself in after 
seeing his photo on a BBC wanted website and was picked out at an ID 
parade due to his distinctive lazy eye.

The assault began in the early evening of June 2 last year after the boy went to a gentleman's toilet at Manchester Arndale Centre after leaving a youth club.

As he stood at the urinals, Eljanabi and Wilson-Fletcher began staring at him. Giving evidence by video link the lad said: 'I left the youth group at 5.45pm.

'I was walking near the Arndale and I needed the toilet. When I went in, some Asian person stood next to me and started staring at me, looking at me up and down.'

The boy said he felt so 'anxious' and nervous' he moved along one urinal for more privacy - but Wilson-Fletcher had already entered the toilets and started eyeing him up on his other side.

The lad added: 'The Asian person grabbed my arm and said, "come with us, you're going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you."

The boy said a cleaner and some other shoppers were present in the toilets, whilst he was threatened and said: 'I started panicking. He mumbled it to me - he said it to me so no-one else could here", he added.

The boy said he made a dash for it, but Eljanabi caught up with him, motioning the boy in the direction of the Debenhams Store with his paper - with Wilson-Fletcher following closely behind.

'He tapped me with the paper. The white person was behind - if I had ran the opposite way, the white man would have been there", he said.

Once inside the store, the youngster was directed into the lift, they took up to the toilets. The two men then abused the boy before Eljanabi raped him as Wilson-Fletcher looked on.

Eljanabi became a suspect after his flat caretaker alerted police after seeing CCTV photograph of him in a public appeal about the attack.

Police swooped and arrested him at his flat in August 2012 and officers found pornographic DVDs of boys in school uniforms. He was matched to the man in the CCTV footage by facial-mapping experts.

Eljanabi who settled in the UK in 2002 later told police: 'I had nothing to do with this attack. I was not there. I was elsewhere. I didn't know the complainant. I have no involvement in this whatsoever.'

The court heard he had served in the Iraqi army as a military intelligence officer and fought in the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 and the Gulf War of the early 90s.

He claimed he had been captured and tortured by American soldiers which left him with long standing knee injuries and said he was bed ridden at the time of the sexual assault.

Wilson-Fletcher said he had 'no recollection what happened that day', but denied any involvement in an attack.

After the case Supt Stuart Ellison, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This crime quite rightly shocked the city centre community as this vulnerable victim was marched across a busy part of the city during a Saturday afternoon.

'That a young boy could be preyed on while all around him shoppers go about their business was doubly shocking.

'Quite rightly everyone felt a sense of shock and disgust when we publicised this case and we still share those feelings."
