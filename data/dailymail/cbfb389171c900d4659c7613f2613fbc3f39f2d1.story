US figure-skating champion Jeremy Abbott lashed out at his critics in a foul-mouthed rant after his and teammate Jason Brown's spectacular slump at the Sochi Olympics.

Olympic champion Evan Lysacek did not defend his title and Abbott and pony-tailed teen Brown failed to sparkle in the Iceberg Skating Palace, to leave the United States off the men's podium for the first time since the 1998 Nagano Games.

Brown, 19, finished ninth and 28-year-old Abbott 12th, although both got bronze with the USA in the new team event.

Oops: Jeremy Abbott falls after failing to complete a jump in the Men's Short Program on Thursday

Smack: Abbott, who has already won a bronze in the group event, smashed onto the ice during the trick

'I just want to put my middle finger 
in the air and say a big 'F-you' to everyone who has ever said that to 
me because they've never stood in my shoes and they've never had to do 
what I've had to do,' said Abbott, who will be remembered more for 
spectacular tumbles in Sochi.

Abbott
 opened the team challenge on the first day of competition with an 
error-strewn short programme and things didn't get better for him in the
 individual event.

The skater from Aspen, Colorado suffered a nasty fall attempting a quad jump in the short programme.

He
 lay in pain for ten seconds as the music continued to play, before 
pulling himself up, rubbing his hip and gliding back into the centre of 
the ice to finish and qualify in 15h place for the free skate final.

Smash: The 28-year-old crashed into the boards and grabbed his hip while howling in pain

'Nobody
 has to stand centre ice in front of a million people and put an entire 
career on the line for eight minutes of their life when they've been 
doing it for 20-some years,' he said, after placing eighth in the free 
skate for an overall 12th position between the two programmes.

'And if you think that that's not hard, then you're a damn idiot.

'I'm
 proud to be standing here. I'm a four-time national champion. I'm a 
two-time Olympian and no one can take that away from me.

'So
 some people can handle it better than others, but everyone has that 
mental struggle, everyone goes through the same doubts. I am not alone. 
They just come at different times and different moments. Some people 
have their moment at the Olympics, and some have theirs at the national 
championships.'

'So 
whatever other people have to say about me, that's their own problem 
because I'm freaking proud of what I've done and I'm not going to 
apologize for any of it.'

He's up! Abbott limps away from the boards - his face creased with pain - but he is determined to carry on

Fighter: Both Russian and American spectators broke into applause as Abbott finished up his routine

Thankful: Abbott acknowledges the crowd with a bouquet of flowers following the men's short program

Teammate
 Brown missed a chance of a podium spot, as he dropped from sixth in the
 short programme to 11th in the free skate for an overall ninth-place 
finish.

'I was hoping for a 
top 10, and I did that, and I got a bronze in the team event. Hopefully 
in the future, I'll get one in the (men's).'
