It is said that they have more time on their hands than most doctors.

And one anaesthetist has certainly put his quiet hours to good use.

Peter Morris, an anaesthetist at Castle Hill Hospital, in east Yorkshire, has managed to write a novel while his patients were unconscious.

Bound with New Ropes, a 480-page love story, follows the tale of a university lecturer who falls for one of his students.

It tracks his downfall as he is eventually found guilty of harassing her.

That the author, who is a staff grade anaesthetist, according to The Independent, uses the ‘Acknowledgements’ page to explain how he had time to write the book, according

Dr Morris writes: ‘Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust kindly paid me to write it while simultaneously giving anaesthetics.

'Many of their tardy surgeons unwittingly helped by making simple operations last for hours.’

Anaesthetists are required to send patients to sleep and then to monitor their vital signs while the operation is being carried out. 

However, they are reputed to have more time on their hands than the surgeons themselves.

Consequently, many are said to be very well read and excel in puzzles such as Suduko.

The anaesthetist says it was possible to write the book because 'tardy surgeons' made 'simple operations last for hours' (posed by model)

On the first page of Dr Morris’ novel, which is self-published and for sale for £10, he writes: ‘She wore a plain black skirt, a white blouse with a slightly lacy collar and an open pale blue cardigan with its sleeves pulled back a little.

‘Although her behaviour was not forward, I sensed in her unstilted conduct some wish to engage with me.

‘Her navy nylon jacket slid off her shoulder-bag onto the cold flag-stones. We both stooped to pick it up and our heads almost collided.’

The novel, which is described on Amazon as exposing 'the modern ropes of duplicity and fake virtue' is currently placed at 370,777 in the best-seller ranking.

On a grey blustery December afternoon, I sat marking essays in my study in Elgan College.

It was dull stuff and gradually, as twilight fell, recurrent distractions stole into my thoughts. For instance, out of the blue I found myself puzzling over girls who had tried to dominate me and who – had I allowed it – would then have despised me.

I sipped tea from a patterned blue and lilac glazed mug, twirled round and stared out through the long floor-length window.

Dusk had engulfed the roof-tops of the town, but down in Noonham Gardens, where some cast-iron street lamps flickered, I glimpsed Deana Sleight strutting home, perhaps in an irritable mood.

Back in the spring I had taken her out, not out of love but out of emotional loneliness or lust, for if sullen and sour she had a sexy inciting shape.

Deana was the secretary in the Archaeology Department and at twenty-nine, three years older than myself.

Beneath her loosely gathered dark hair and her glinting thick-length belted black leather jacket, I could dimly make out the hem of her pleated tartan skirt, her black tights and her glistening black high-heeled leather boots.

Again the paradox had been that despite bullying me, deep down she had wanted to be mastered. I watched her provocative hour-glass outline swaying along beside a set of iron railings until it receded through a soot-blackened archway.
