Hatem Ben Arfa could have to wait until next season before making his Nice debut.

The 27-year-old was released from his contract with Newcastle United earlier this month before signing for the Ligue 1 club.

But the France Football Federation (FFF) have not yet given Ben Arfa clearance to play. This is because FIFA rules state that a player can only represent two clubs in any one season.

Ben Arfa turned out for Newcastle's Under 21 side in August before a loan move to Hull City.

His stint at the KC Stadium was short-lived, however, and the former French Footballer of the Year turned out just nine times for the Tigers before manager Steve Bruce decided to let him go.

The FFF have now passed Ben Arfa's case to FIFA.
