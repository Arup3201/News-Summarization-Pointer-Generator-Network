Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado kept his spirits up by enjoying some top nosh in a London restaurant with team-mates Etienne Capoue and Benjamin Stambouli on Wednesday night.

The out of form Spanish striker was again left out of Vicente del Bosque's national team  squad, which takes on Belarus and Germany in this international break.

Instead he has stayed in London to be put through his paces by Mauricio Pochettino, who punished those remaining from his underperforming side with a double training session.

Soldado, Capoue and Stambouli recovered from the session with a visit to Sushisamba.
