Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev was damned as an unreliable witness by an SFA Judicial Panel on Tuesday after they threw out his appeal against a seven-match ban for racial abuse.

A Judicial Panel Appellate Tribunal chaired by senior judge Lord Bonomy found the Bulgarian guilty of calling Aberdeen defender Shay Logan a ‘black c***’ and ruled there was no reason to overturn the initial verdict.

Although Celtic insist they will stand by Tonev and press for changes to a disciplinary system that relies on the balance of probabilities, the Written Reasons behind both judgements - published on the recommendation of Lord Bonomy - left Tonev’s reputation badly damaged.

The Celtic winger lost his appeal against a seven-match ban for racial abuse

The 24-year-old, who refused the offer of a translator during both hearings, was found to have delivered an ‘inherently improbable account’ of the verbal exchange he had with Logan during the Celtic-Aberdeen game in Glasgow on September 13.

And the official report declared: ‘On the central issue in the case we were unable to accept him as either credible or reliable.

‘We found on the balance of probabilities that Mr Tonev did say to Mr Logan “Don’t touch me you black c***”.’

Celtic’s counsel argued that Logan could have misheard Tonev, something the English defender denied ‘one thousand per cent’ – and also insisted that the burden of proof should be higher for such a serious accusation.

Celtic have insisted they will stand by Tonev who does protest his innocence 

Celtic’s response also attacked a system that as, Tonev’s lawyer described it, pits ‘one player’s word against the other’. A club statement declared: ‘Celtic Football Club is extremely disappointed by the outcome of the Scottish FA’s Appeal Tribunal.

‘We do not consider that any player should be found guilty of such a grave offence on the basis of the evidence presented in this case. Celtic Football Club will be approaching the Scottish FA to seek to address this issue.

‘We would like to make it clear that at no stage was it ever suggested that Shay Logan had made any false allegations. However, Aleksandar Tonev’s position consistently has been that he did not say the words that were alleged to have been said and that he is not a racist.

Celtic's counsel argued that Logan could have misheard Tonev, something that the Aberdeen man denies

Winger Tonev is currently on loan from Premier League side Aston Villa

‘Celtic Football Club has enjoyed an excellent relationship with Aberdeen Football Club and this, of course, will continue.

‘As we have said many times before, racism has no place in football and as a Club which has been open to all ever since its formation in 1888, Celtic abhors racism of any kind. Clearly, Aleksandar continues to have our full support.’

Celtic also have the option, if they wish, of taking the Tonev case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

The on-loan Aston Villa winger’s ban will begin immediately, although he has already served one match of the suspension, meaning he will be back in time for Ross County away on January 24.
