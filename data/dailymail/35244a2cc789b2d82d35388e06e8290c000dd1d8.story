Bail: Danny Simpson was arrested on suspicion of attacking a man with an iron bar

Queens Park Rangers defender Danny Simpson has been arrested over claims he attacked a man with an iron bar, after tracking him down and suspecting he stole his phone.

The player is said to have lashed out after discovering his iPhone had vanished while on a night out.

It is thought the 27-year-old used a tracker on the phone to trace it to a house in Manchester.

The defender, who split with N-Dubz singer Tulisa last May, is accused of confronting a 34-year-old man outside his home.

It is alleged the man was attacked with an iron bar, leaving him with head injuries.

A police car on patrol in the area spotted the altercation and neighbours watched as Simpson was handcuffed and led away.

One onlooker told The Sun: 'The noise was horrendous and when I looked out there were lads on the street.

'Some police officers whose car was caught in traffic saw it and pulled over.

'Charlie
 still looks in a bad way and he doesn't want to talk about what 
happened.'

Another neighbour said there was blood everywhere.

Simpson has been bailed on suspicion of wounding with intent and grievous bodily harm.

If found guilty the footballer could face up to 25 years in prison.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'Police were called at 8.15am on Tuesday to reports of an altercation outside a house in Withington.Â
