A 16-year-old girl accused of helping her friend murder a man in a street attack has been cleared of killing him.

The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was also found not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter by a jury at Bristol Crown Court.

She had been accused of murdering Mark Roberts, 35, who was attacked as he walked home alone following a night out with friends in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset in October last year.

Ryan Sheppard, 18, of Weston super Mare, had previously admitted the murder of Mr Roberts and will be sentenced next month.

Jurors in the teenage girl’s trial heard that Mr Roberts was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood following the 'ugly and sustained attack'.

Residents called paramedics and Mr Roberts, who suffered a cardiac arrest, was taken to Weston General Hospital, where he died 36 hours later.

The court was told that Mr Roberts's cause of death was the combined effect of blunt force impacts to the head and face together with heavy consumption of alcohol.'

Forensic scientists also found bruising and a partial shoeprint - matching footwear recovered from Sheppard - on Mr Roberts’s forehead.

Mr Roberts’s blood was found on Sheppard’s clothing, on his trainer and elbow and also on the cuff of a coat worn by the girl that evening.

She claimed blood on her cuff was due to Sheppard telling her to wipe his shoe, the jury heard.

The girl, from Bristol, had been accused of attacking Mr Roberts and then using her mobile phone to film Sheppard beating him to death.

After her arrest, the girl initially refused to comment but later provided a statement to police denying any involvement in the attack.

'Ryan hit him in the jaw,' the girl’s statement said.

'I tried pulling Ryan off but I couldn’t. Ryan started banging Mark’s head on the floor and punching him to the body and face.

'Ryan stopped, he told me to video it. I was scared of Ryan so I did because I didn’t want him to do something like that to me.

'I filmed for a minute and a half, Ryan hitting Mark on the floor saying aggressive things to him. Mark was saying and doing nothing.'

The court heard that the video clip was later deleted and police have never been able to recover it.

The girl, who was 15 at the time of the attack, did not give evidence in her defence during the trial.

An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'Over the past two weeks the jury has listened to the evidence in this case and after deliberating have found this young woman not guilty.

'We respect the decision reached by the jury and we’ll now start preparing for the sentencing of Ryan Sheppard, who has already pleaded guilty to the murder of Mark.'
