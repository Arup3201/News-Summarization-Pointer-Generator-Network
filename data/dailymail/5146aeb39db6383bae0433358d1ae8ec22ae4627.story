The two New York City police officers who posed for a photograph with a topless model on the street are facing an internal investigation, it has emerged.

Model Cheyenne Lutek, 19, was photographed with the officers on Sunday, a week after she exposed her bare breasts at Verso Restaurant in Alphabet City while astounded patrons looked on.

After she was told to cover up by staff, the glamorous blonde upped the ante by taking the X-rated stunt on to the streets of Manhattan and posing with the officers near their Housing Bureau station.

Law and order: Cheyenne Lutek poses half-naked with two grinning NYPD cops. It is entirely legal for women to appear in New York City streets partially nude but the officers are now under investigation

Photographer Allen Henson told the New
York Daily News that one of the officers 'couldn't stop grinning' while
the other was more awkward around the topless model.

After
snapping the shot, Henson tweeted: 'A nice stroll on a New York Summer 
evening. With @Cheyenne_Lutek and a couple of NYC's finest boys in 
blue.'

Police sources told 
the newspaper that the Internal Affairs Bureau has launched an 
investigation, which will likely be given to the officers' integrity 
control officer.

The men are
allowed to pose for photographs but sources told the Daily News that 
the raunchy nature of the picture could lead to a verbal reprimand.

This unidentified woman walked into a restaurant, sat down clothed, then too her shirt off while a man snapped photos

In May, the New York City Police Department released an official memo cited by The New York Times 
informing all police officers that it is not illegal for women to walk 
around the city shirtless, and that they should not be cited for public 
lewdness or indecent exposure.

The
order given to the cityâ€™s 34,000 cops stems from a 1992 New York State 
Court of Appeals, which states that baring one's chest in public is 
legal for a woman as it is for a man.

Miss Lutek and Mr Henson hit a trendy Italian restaurant last weekend where the photographer pulled out his camera and proceeded to snap pictures of the X-rated scene.

Verso's owner Labinot Baraliu rushed over the table and demanded that the half-naked woman put her clothes back on.

Hot spot: The owner of Verso restaurant in Alphabet City promptly rushed over and asked the woman to put her shirt back on, but she protested she had the law on her side

In response, Miss Lutek insisted that it was 'perfectly legal' to go topless in the restaurant.

'In 15 years [in the restaurant business] I've seen all kinds of things, but not this,' Baraliu explained to the East Village blog EV Grieve. 'It was funny, but at the same time I was like "WTF - is this really happening?"'

After exchanging a few words with the owner, the couple were escorted out of the bistro.

Despite the legislation because a restaurant is private property, its patrons are subject to whatever rules the business has in place.
