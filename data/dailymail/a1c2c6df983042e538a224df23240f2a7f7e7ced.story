A hospital has apologised for a ‘botched’ operation which left a new mother with a surgical packing 'tampon' stitched up inside her.

The woman had given birth at Lincoln County Hospital but no one realised the surgical material was still in her body when she was helped off the operating table.

Today hospital bosses promised ‘lessons will be learned’ from the botched operation, which led to the stitches having to be removed and put back in again after the padding was taken out.

The mistake has been classed as an NHS ‘never event’, an incident regarded by the Government as so serious they should never happen.

The event , which occurred on the maternity wing in November, was potentially the most serious to occur in a medical environment, the medical director for the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, revealed at a board meeting.

Dr Suneil Kapadia said: 'This never event occurred at the obstetrics unit when suturing took place after delivery.

'As part of this process a tampon was used and, regrettably, it was identified as having been left when the patient had been treated.

'Although it wasn’t in itself dangerous because it was removed immediately, it was a significant error because had it been left in, it would have caused infection.

'Fortunately, it was resolved within a very short time and the mother suffered no ill-effects.

'She’s fine and there has been dialogue with the family since this happened.

'We are still looking at this incident in great depth to discover what led up to it and how we can learn from it.

'This is very unfortunate and I do agree that the timing is unfortunate in view of the Keogh report, which was very damning.

“It should never have happened at all, but it is the first never event in more than a year.
