Violent clashes took place on the streets of Belfast last night following an Orange Order parade, leaving many police officers injured.

The loyalist march through the 
Ardoyne sectarian area was peaceful but trouble flared when there was a clash with rival Republicans and crowds of several hundred then confronted lines of riot police.

Fireworks, petrol bombs, stones, 
bricks and bottles were hurled at police lines and a burning silver BMW 
driven at officers in the residential neighbourhood of red-brick 
terraced houses.

Guns were also fired by protesters with experts saying today that it is lucky nobody was killed when violence flared. More than 20 police officers were 
injured but none are thought to be seriously hurt.

The chairman of the Northern Ireland Parades Commission today defended the decision to allow to rival parades to go ahead within two hours of each other in North Belfast which ended with serious public disorder and dissident republican gunmen opening fire on police.

Politicians on all sides, including Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson, had criticised Parades Commission decisions which meant the Orangemen having to return early from the main Twelfth of July rally in the city - and allowing a parade by local residents to go ahead in the same place two hours later. Dissident republicans, many of them from outside the area, were among the crowds.

The Commission was established to adjudicate on contentious marches, and even though there has been major trouble at this particular Catholic/Protestant flashpoint every year for over a decade, the chairman Peter Osborne said given the circumstances, the rulings were correct.

He also hit out at people whom he claimed stood on the sidelines criticising their work. The language and comments in the days leading up to the parades had heightened tensions and were not helpful.

Worrying: Violent clashes took place on the streets of Belfast last night following an Orange Order parade which resulted in a number of police officers being left injured

Confrontation: The loyal order march through the Ardoyne sectarian interface was peaceful but trouble flared nearby with crowds of several hundred confronting lines of riot police

Mr Osborne told BBC Radio Ulster: 'It is complete and utter nonsense to blame the Parades Commission for the violence last night. There has been violence in this location for many, many years now.

'It is time for politicians to take ownership of contentious parades... that’s the way forward.'

A republican march through the same area shortly afterwards prompted an exchange of missiles between loyalists and nationalists.

Water cannon vehicles were used extensively and one non-lethal baton round fired.

Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said: 'Unfortunately, police are now dealing with significant disorder in the Brompton Park and Balhom Road area.

'Water cannon has again been deployed and four officers have been injured. Their injuries are not believed to be life- threatening.

'I am urging all individuals and communities affected to respond to developing events in a calm and responsible manner. Violence has serious and unwanted consequences for us all and we will robustly investigate all incidents of disorder.'

A token parade by around 15 Orangemen through Ardoyne passed in silence just before 4pm. A residents' protest supported by Sinn Fein was peaceful.

Democratic Unionist MP Nigel Dodds said the second march by nationalists was linked to dissident republicans.

He criticised the Parades Commission's decision to allow the republican parade.

'The Parades Commission pandered to this outfit. They are incapable of reaching a resolution because they only want violence, they don't want settlement, they just want to derail the peace process,' he said.

Police appealed for calm in the area.

Difficult night: Water cannon vehicles were used extensively and one non-lethal baton round fired. In total, four police officers were left injured following the clashes

The Protestant Orange Order is marking the Twelfth of July culmination of its summer marching season, with many parades across the region. It celebrates the victory of Protestant King William over Catholic King James. It has traditionally polarised Catholics and Protestants but violence has been confined to isolated pockets.

Ardoyne has been the scene for trouble on this date for many years and has become a byword for inter-communal strife on that date, despite most people from the area disagreeing with violence.

There was also violence in Londonderry’s nationalist Bogside, where petrol bombs were thrown at police and a car set alight. In south and east Belfast there were five arrests for a variety of offences including disorderly behaviour.

Fury: Masked youths can be seen throwing objects at the police as the water cannon tried to disperse them

Rest: Tired riot police sit and reflect on a night of violence that left 20 of their colleagues injured

There has been trouble annually at Ardoyne in recent years following Orange parades through the area.

This year around 15 Orangemen with banners paraded in silence through the residential area of red brick terraced housing in a token demonstration.

There was a separate parade by republicans as well as protests by nationalist residents and loyalists in the area.

Six men, aged 34, 28, 21, 19, 19 and 18, are to to appear at Belfast Magistrates’ Court later today charged with various public disorder offences.

They were arrested following trouble in the Broadway area of the city which erupted on Wednesday night and lasted until the early hours of Thursday.

Another man, aged 23, will appear at the court on August 8 charged with assaulting and obstructing police.
