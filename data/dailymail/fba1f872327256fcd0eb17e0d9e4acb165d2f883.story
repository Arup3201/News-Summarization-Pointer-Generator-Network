Manchester United supporters were made to remove a banner mocking Steven Gerrard's slip against Chelsea last season during the Red Devils' 3-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday.

A section of home fans brought a large red banner to Old Trafford which poked fun at the 34-year-old's costly error against Jose Mourinho's men in late April.

But they were quickly forced to take it down by stewards after being told it could be a fire hazard.

The banner, which featured a silhouette of Gerrard's slip and the words 'Au revoir Gerrard, come back when you've won one', is similar to one shown off by Liverpool supporters in 1993.

Following United's first league title in 26 years, fans at Anfield greeted Eric Cantona with the message 'Au revoir Cantona and Man United, come back when you've won 18!'.

A United spokesperson told The Daily Telegraph: 'Any banner over a certain size would need a fire certificate. This banner would have contravened the ground regulations.'

Gerrard played the entire game on Sunday as Brendan Rodgers' side slumped to their seventh Premier League defeat of the season.

Goals from Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata sealed a 3-0 victory for Louis van Gaal's men, while Gerrard was booked for holding back the Dutchman.
