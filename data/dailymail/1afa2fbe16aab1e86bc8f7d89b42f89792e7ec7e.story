When choosing an animal to protect your home, you might have thought that a dog would be enough to scare off any would-be intruders.

But one pet-owner was perhaps hoping to give any burglars an extra fright by dressing their Dogue de Bordeaux up as a lion.

In two pictures posted on Twitter, the animal can be seen proudly standing guard by his front gate, before looking confused while sitting on a bed.

It is not the first time that a dog owner has attempted to disguise their faithful friend as a lion.

In August last year a Chinese zoo was mocked online after trying to pass off a hairy dog as the king of beasts after removing the exotic animal from its enclosure.

The tourist attraction also placed a mongrel dog in the leopard enclosure, and exchanged their wolf for a white dog breed.

While the zoo groomed their animals in an attempt to make them appear wild, the owner of this Dogue de Bordeaux appears to have used a costume.

Fancy dress lion manes, which are designed to fit both cats and dogs, are widely available online and cost around £5.

Do you have any pictures of your pet dressed up in fancy-dress? We'd love to hear from you. Please send your pictures to chris.pleasance@mailonline.co.uk
