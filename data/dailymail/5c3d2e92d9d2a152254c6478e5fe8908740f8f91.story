Alan Shearer has sent a letter to the family of Liam Sweeney, a Newcastle fan who died in the MH17 crash in Ukraine.

The victim's father, Barry Sweeney, said he was 'humbled' by the letter and said he also received condolences from Toon manager Alan Pardew.

Sweeney told the Sunday Sun: 'There was a letter addressed to the family that arrived on Friday,'

Record: Alan Shearer has scored more goals for Newcastle than any other player

'When we opened it the letter said among other things "we come from the same sort of family and we support the same team. These words come from the heart".

'The letter was signed Alan Shearer.

'Alan Pardew has also sent some nice messages to our family and we’re humbled by all the support we’ve received.

'I haven’t been able to thank everyone personally because I’ve spoken to so many people. But I want everyone to know how grateful we are.

'When I go into our local Morrisons where Liam used to work I find myself hugging people who are in tears and not the other way around.

'He was a really well-liked lad and a loyal Toon fan.'
