Four ministers sacked in September's reshuffle were given knighthoods by David Cameron

David Cameron has been criticised by a powerful Commons committee for giving knighthoods to ministers given the boot in this year’s reshuffle.

The Prime Minister is accused of ‘politicising’ the honours system by MPs who say they were left ‘perplexed and disillusioned’ by his decision to give gongs to middle-ranking ministers told to return to the backbenches.

After September’s reshuffle James Paice, Edward Garnier, Nick Harvey and Gerald Howard were all recommended by for knighthoods by Mr Cameron.

Sir George Young was made a Companion of Honour after being sacked as Commons leader, but within weeks returned to government as Chief Whip.

The awards sparked outrage because more senior women – including Cabinet ministers Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan – were dumped from government without being offered an honour.

It follows a major row in August when it emerged that a secret quota system meant three times as many civil servants could receive honours than medal winners at the London Olympics.

Ministers have now agreed to release full explanations for of why honours are given to remove any suggestion of politicial interfeefence or corruption. The public citations will be trialled in the New Year’s Honours List.

But today the Commons Public Administration Select criticised giving knighthoods to former ministers and accused Mr Cameron of going against earlier assurances that honours would not be made for political reasons.

Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin took the unusual step of releasing a letter he sent to Mr Cameron warning the knighthoods for ex-ministers appeared ‘inconsistent’ with evidence given to the committee by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, during its inquiry into the honours system.

Mr Jenkin, a senior Tory MP, wrote: ‘If it is the policy of the Government that the Prime Minister should retain the right to award honours at his personal behest, why was this not apparent from the Government's submissions to our inquiry?

‘The honours you have announced may well reward “exceptional service”, but there is a danger that they will appear to the public to be political 'consolation prizes' for the ministers concerned.’

The committee’s report, published today, said the PM had to explain himself if he intended to take political control of the honours system.

‘Without questioning the public service of those selected, by the Prime Minister, to receive honours at the end of their ministerial career, we are concerned that awarding honours in such a manner will further reduce public confidence in the honours system.

‘Again, if the Government supports such political control of the award of honours in certain circumstances, it should be prepared to justify that.’

The committee warned that the credibility of the Parliamentary and Political Service Honours Committee was also in danger of being undermined by the decision to include the chief whips of the three main political parties.

It said that their presence left it open to the charge of ‘political manipulation in the interest of party leaders’.

Mr Jenkin added: ‘If honours are to retain any meaning and value they must be awarded to genuinely deserving recipients who have contributed to their communities above and beyond the norm, through a transparent system where people can see the value of the honour and what it was awarded for.’

In his reply Mr Cameron insisted that he had only made a ‘very limited number’ of awards, adding: ‘I am determined that these special cases will not affect the integrity of the wider honours system.’
