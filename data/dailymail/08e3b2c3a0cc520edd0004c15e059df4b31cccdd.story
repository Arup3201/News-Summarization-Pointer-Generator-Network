Spies are being given a ‘licence to speed’ for the first time.

Ministers will announce tomorrow that Britain’s secret agents are to be exempted from the laws of the road.

Currently, MI5 and MI6 officers must stay within  the speed limits even if security is at risk.

MI6 Headquarters: Intelligence officials are currently not allowed to break the speed limit, even if security is a at risk

But now the agencies will join the list  of organisations that can  speed when responding to emergency situations.

Bomb disposal units, mountain rescue teams and organ transplant drivers will also be granted the freedom to break speed limits. But all those who are exempt will be required to pass advanced driving courses.

At the moment, only the police, ambulance and fire crews can break speed laws.
