Australian teen suicide bomber Jake Bilardi  was sitting on the couch of his Melbourne home, across from one of his brothers, when he panicked. 

The future jihadist, then 16-years-old, started shaking with anxiety, his heart pounding, trying to avoid eye contact with his sibling, 'too scared to move'.  

'I had begun to believe he was a complete stranger out to kill me... I just looked around the room, wondering if there were hidden cameras some where (sic),' he purportedly writes in an online post.

'I realised what was happening after about 10 minutes however I didn't sleep that night because I was really scared for hours after.'  

A series of questions posted to Yahoo! Answers, seen by Daily Mail Australia and purportedly belonging to Bilardi, provide a troubling insight into the warped mind of the troubled young Melbourne man, who this week reportedly blew himself up in Ramadi, Iraq, 110km west of Baghdad.

In this post titled 'I don't feel like this is my home?' two years ago, 'Jake' asked Yahoo! users what could be wrong with him as he had never had an episode 'as serious as this'.

On Thursday, an image of Bilardi sitting in front of an Islamic State flag was posted to Twitter

He said 'since I was about 11 or 12 years old I have felt sometimes like my home wasn't really my home and that it was all a set up.

'I am now 16 years old and it has gotten to the point where I it feels like I am on a movie set, I live with two older siblings and I sometimes even start to question who they are and believe that they are plotting to kill me'. Users advised he see a psychiatrist, or a doctor.

Jake asked 60 questions on the service, sometimes seeking advice on serious matters such as this one. Sometimes they are the studious, perhaps school-related questions of an intelligent teenager, for instance asking whether Russia is a part of Asia or Europe. 

At other times, he shows typical teenage insecurity. Jake asked Yahoo! users if 'appearance is important in journalism' and said he had unsuccessfully applied for a job at one of his local newspapers. 

'I am looking for a job in journalism and I was wondering if good looks are important. I will admit now that I am ugly although I really want to do journalism and was wondering if there is any importance toward appearance in order to be employed,' he said.  

In interviews with six of his stunned former classmates at Craigieburn Secondary College on Thursday, Daily Mail Australia was told the former maths whiz and founder of a children's soccer charity had harboured ambitions of becoming a political journalist. 

Other questions reveal his increasingly devout pursuit of the Islamic and parts of his ultimately successful plan to join the fighting in the Middle East.

Over the years, he sought advice on how to correctly follow his Islamic faith, requesting help on how he could pray at school and at his job, at a Safeway supermarket. Around a year ago, he even asked if he could still celebrate Christmas as a Muslim. 

'Is it alright for me to continue taking part because some people in my family still aren't happy with my decision and I have been trying to make things as normal as possible, so it would be really awkward and weird if I wasn't taking part,' he asked. 

His final four questions to the online community betray his decision to leave the country, asking about Australian immigration processes, including his concerns about how he had made a mistake on his application for an Australian passport ten months ago. 

Seven months ago, he asked about the 'outgoing passenger cards' that Australians generally sign at the airport. 'I need an outgoing passenger card to leave Australia and I don't know where I can get one. 

'People have told me I can get it at the check-in counters but I am going to check in online so I can avoid the lines. 

'Does anyone know where I can get one?'

The Federal Government is investigating the reports of Bilardi's suicide mission.
