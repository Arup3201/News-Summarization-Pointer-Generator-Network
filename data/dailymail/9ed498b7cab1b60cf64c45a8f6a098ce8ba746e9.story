A man is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the genitals outside a controversial Pound Pub, which offers pints for as little as £1.50.

The victim, aged in his 50s, is thought to have been involved in a row in the pub in Atherton in Wigan on Monday night.

The altercation continued outside the premises on Market Street just after 9pm and an ambulance was called after reports the man has suffered a stab wound to his groin.

He was treated at the scene before being taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where his condition is not thought to be life-threatening.

A spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service confirmed they had treated a man who had been wounded in 'his central location'.

Greater Manchester Police also confirmed they were continuing to investigate the assault.

A spokeswoman said: 'The man has been taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening.'

One local, Joe Ross, 37, told the Leigh Journal: 'A lot of people have been talking about what happened but it has been turning into Chinese whispers.

'The man’s injuries are a man’s worst nightmare. A man inflicting an injury like that on another man is just sickening, it’s wrong. I can’t think about it without feeling ill myself.'

The Pound Pub, which sells half pints of beer, lager and cider for £1 and pints for £1.50 opened in Atherton in May.

Concerns were raised from other licensees in the town fearing an increase in alcohol-fuelled trouble, while some residents of Atherton criticised the pub for taking advantage of 'vulnerable' drinkers and lowering the tone of the town.

The local council had also raised fears that the pub would encourage 'irresponsible' problem drinking and threaten public health.

But at the time of opening, publican Dave Sutton, 31, said: 'At the end of the day, if you can only drink ten pints at £3, you are still only going to be able to drink that if they’re £1.50.

'We don’t encourage people to get drunk and there’s been no more trouble. In fact the pub is already going very well and the customers seem to be happy.

'The other pubs in the town are not so happy but that’s not our fault. That’s just because throughout the day we have the majority of customers in the town in here.

'Pubs around the country are shutting all the time so something has to be done - and this could be it.'

A second Pound Pub is also open in Stockton on Tees, with plans for more of the discount pubs to open nationwide.
