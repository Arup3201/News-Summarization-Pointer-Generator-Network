David Strettle reminded England coach Stuart Lancaster of his predatory credentials with a match-winning hat-trick that helped erase the painful memories of Saracens last Twickenham visit.

The former England international, who finished last season as the Aviva Premiership’s leading English-qualified try-scorer with 11 touchdowns, was back in business again on Saturday as Mark McCall’s men made hard work of putting Dai Young’s resurgent Wasps away.

His last-minute try - awarded by Television Match Official David Sainsbury but contested by Young and his Wasps charges - stole what would have been a famous victory from Wasps; who also failed to win on the opening day of last season by the narrowest of margins.

Saracens have spent the summer employing a variety of methods to help support their players, including one similar to that used to treat service veterans suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, following the agony of losing in both European and domestic finals. But there’s nothing like getting back on the bike. 

On Saturday they had Strettle to thank following a below-par performance that saw them take a 21-6 first-half lead before allowing another winger with England credentials, Christian Wade, to put Wasps within sight of victory before Strettle pounced.

‘We had drama here at the end of last season and we had drama here again today,’ said Strettle. ‘The intensity wasn’t there all the time but we got there in the end.’

The 31-year-old Strettle made the last of his 14 England appearances on tour in Argentina 15 months ago and has been overtaken in the pecking order by the likes of Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell, Jonny May, Chris Ashton and his opposite man in this game, Wade.

Committed: It was a tense encounter at Twickenham between London rivals Wasps and Saracens 

‘I still have England ambitions but you should be asking Stuart Lancaster,’ Strettle added. ‘I want to be involved in the World Cup. I think I played well enough last season to be in the squad but nobody has told me what I need to do to get there.’

Wade will consider himself unlucky to have been on the losing side after producing an enormously encouraging display on his first game back since suffering a serious foot injury at the tail end of last season which cost him his place on England’s tour to New Zealand.

In truth, the whole Wasps team will be kicking themselves after battling their way back from an awful first-half display to find themselves 28-20 in front when Wade touched down for his second try after 60 minutes.

They only had themselves to blame in front of 66,164 at Twickenham. First, Strettle latched on to replacement Owen Farrell’s clever pass to cross in the left-hand corner. The fly-half converted to make the score 28-27.

As Wasps sensed a repeat of last season’s defeat to Harlequins on day one of the season, Young’s men seemed to suffer a case of the collective collywobbles. Flanker Ashley Johnson — outstanding up until that point — stood still before hitting a ruck close to Saracens’ line before being penalised by referee Andrew Small and allowing Saracens to clear their lines and breathe again.

Centre Duncan Taylor burst through the Wasps midfield and Farrell was again on hand to feed Strettle to bounce over in the corner with Elliot Daly in close attendance. Referee Small referred the decision to the TMO and, just like last season’s final on the same ground, the decision went in the attacking team’s favour. This time, unlike their last-gasp defeat to Northampton in May, Saracens were the beneficiaries.

‘It’s important we recognised there was some hurt from last season,’ McCall said. ‘We’ve talked about the response we’ve wanted to have to the way last season ended. There’s certainly been no self-pity at our club. We’ve moved on.’

Young, sat disbelieving as his side blew their second London double header in succession, was left fuming at the decision to award Strettle’s third try after he’d opened his account with another contentious first-half effort which saw him make the slightest of contacts with Wasps full back Rob Miller before touching down.

‘Our first 40 minutes weren’t good enough,’ said Young. ‘We were much better in the second half but ended up committing suicide. There were two decisions which didn’t go our way. But the reason Sarries are a champion team is because they take every single opportunity they get.’

Wasps replacement prop Phil Swainston will be assessed this week after passing the newly updated 10-minute Head Injury Assessment only to suffer another head knock when he returned.
