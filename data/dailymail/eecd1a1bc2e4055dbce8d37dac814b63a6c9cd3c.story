Two Twitter trolls were jailed yesterday for threatening to kill and rape a feminist for campaigning to put Jane Austen on the new £10 note.

Arts college graduate Isabella Sorley, 23, and unemployed recluse John Nimmo, 25, were told it was ‘hard to imagine more extreme threats’.

As he jailed the pair at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Judge Howard Riddle said it was 'hard to imagine more extreme threats'.

Sorley was given 12 weeks behind bars while co-defendant Nimmo was given eight weeks in prison.

Jailed: Isabella Sorley, 23, (left) was jailed for 12 weeks and John Nimmo, 25, (right) was jailed for eight weeks for subjecting high-profile feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to abuse on Twitter

The pair bombarded feminist journalist Ms Criado-Perez with abusive messages last year after she led a successful campaign using
 social media for a female figure to appear on a Bank of England note.

Judge
 Riddle said that, despite the defendants' claims, the harm threatened 
against Ms Criado-Perez 'must have been intended to be very high'.

Unemployed
 Nimmo also targeted his abuse at Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for 
Walthamstow, with the message 'The things I cud do to u (smiley face)', 
calling her 'Dumb blond b****'.

The judge said the effect of the abuse on Ms Criado-Perez had been 'life- changing'.

She describes 'panic and fear and horror,' he said.

He added that it had also had a 'substantial' impact on Ms Creasy, who has had a panic button installed in her home.

Judge Riddle said that both victims of abuse had been terrified.

'The fact that they were anonymous heightened the fear,' he said.

'The
 victims had no way of knowing how dangerous the people making the 
threats were, whether they had just come out of prison, or how to 
recognise and avoid them if they came across them in public.'

Victim: Labour MP Stella Creasy who was also targeted by Twitter trolls

The court heard that university-educated Sorley has 25 previous convictions, the majority for being drunk and disorderly.

While
 on bail for this case, she also committed two offences of assaulting a 
police officer and is awaiting sentence for an assault on New Year's 
Day, the court heard.

Judge Riddle said Nimmo 'used a degree of sophistication including using different accounts' to carry out the abuse and added: 'You appear to blame the victim to some degree.'

He described Sorley as an 'intelligent and well-educated woman' with a 2:1 degree in creative advertising, but said her apology appeared 'hollow'.

'You have offended so many times when drunk that it must have been obvious to you that you needed to deal with this problem if you were not to continue to cause harm to others,' he said.

During mitigation, Sean Caulfield, defending Sorley, said she herself was a 'victim' of new technology as she did not understand the impact of what she was doing.

'She understands what it must have been like now. At the time, it seems, she did not,' Mr Caulfield said.

'Maybe there's an issue about the technology and Twitter and people understanding what it must be like on the other end.

'She is a victim of that, if nothing else - a victim of a lack of understanding of what this new technology can do and how powerful it is.'

Paul Kennedy, representing Nimmo, described him as a 'somewhat sad individual' who is 'effectively a social recluse'.

The banknote announcement was hailed as a 'brilliant day for women' by Ms Criado-Perez who led the high profile campaign

Mr Kennedy said that, when Nimmo's 
original tweet was responded to and retweeted, it encouraged him to send
 more messages as he saw it as an 'indication of popularity'.

'He said that if that had not happened then he would not have pursued this course of action,' the barrister said.

'He believed at that time that there was a conversation and he was engaging in that conversation.'

Mr
 Kennedy said Nimmo had no particular opinion on the campaign but had 
seen the topic trending on Twitter and his lack of experience of social 
interaction meant he did not know his behaviour was inappropriate.

Nimmo,
 from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, and Sorley, from Akenside Hill, 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, pleaded guilty to sending menacing tweets on 
January 7, admitting they were among the users of 86 separate Twitter 
accounts from which Ms Criado-Perez had received abusive messages.

The judge said both defendants would serve half their sentences in custody and ordered them each to pay £800 compensation.

In
 a statement released via Twitter after the sentencing, Ms Criado-Perez 
said that she was 'relieved' the judge had given the pair strong 
sentences.

'I did not attend
 the sentencing as I didn't feel I could cope with being in court with 
them - and I didn't feel sure that the judge would understand how 
terrifying and scarring the whole experience has been for me, which 
again is not something I could face,' she wrote.

'I feel immensely relieved that the judge clearly has understood the severity of the impact this abuse has had on me.

'The damages that have been awarded to me will be going to charity. When this has all sunk in I will decide which charity.'
