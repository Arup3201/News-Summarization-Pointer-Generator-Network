Rumours that Facebook is working on a branded handset have been around since 2010, and now new patent images have added fuel to this fire.

The patent was originally filed in 2011 by a lead Facebook engineer and features a traditional touchscreen, with a touchpad on the side.

An alternative image shows this touchpad on the rear of the device, with a clickable button on the side instead - both of which could be used to recognise certain gestures.

The patent was originally filed in 2011 by a lead Facebook engineer. It details a traditional touchscreen, with a touchpad on the side, pictured, that would use a 'gesture recognition library' to respond to certain movements.

The latest patent was discovered by Patent Bolt, but it is not the first to hint towards plans of a Facebook device.

In
 2011, the site filed a patent called Mobile Device with Concave Shaped 
Back Side, which was a precursor to the current curved phones, including
 the LG G Flex and the Samsung Round.

The initial reports of a Facebook phone were posted in a TechCrunch report in September 2010.

It
 claimed a source with ‘knowledge of the project’ had told the site 
Facebook was building the software for a phone, while a third party was 
building the hardware.

According to the files, the touchpads and buttons would respond to finger movements using a ‘gesture recognition library.’

As the application, called Navigating Applications Using Side-Mounted Touchpad, explained:  ‘A user taps or strikes lightly on touchpad, and a gesture recognition library can interpret the user's touch input and identify the touch input corresponding to a tap event.’

For example, flicking up on the pad could post a Facebook status, while flicking down could be used to send a message.

A flow diagram in the patent also describes how a series of taps could be used to access photos, specific friends or news feed content.

Although a number of the images show Facebook screens, the patent doesn’t explicitly claim the gestures would only control Facebook options.

The initial reports of a Facebook phone, patent images pictured, emerged in September 2010

They could be used to interact with content on other websites and services, for example.

These gesture controls follow on from a previous Facebook patent, called Content Scrolling and Transitioning Using Touchpad Input.

This would follow Google’s lead. Google has previously worked with Asus and LG on its Nexus range of devices and rumours suggest it may have enlisted HTC to work on the next-generation models.
