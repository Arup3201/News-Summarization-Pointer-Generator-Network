Ahead of the clash with Chile, Brazil pin-up star Neymar – who so far is living up to his billing as Pele’s heir, has admitted he came close to joining Chelsea as an 18 year old.

The Blues tried to tempt him away from Santos when they were alerted of his potential after West Ham had £12million bid turned down that summer for the then ‘unknown’ mega-star in the making.

His first season at Barcelona after his transfer last summer was not sensational – Gareth Bale has made a bigger impact after his move to Real Madrid.

Stardust: Brazil's Neymar is realising his potential in this World Cup and Thiago Silva expects him to get even better

But Neymar is coming of age at this World Cup and his Brazil skipper Thiago Silva reckons he can eventually reach the level of Lionel Messi.

Silva said: ‘Neymar is growing into a crescendo.

‘Messi is one of the best strikers in the world, one of the very best players. But Neymar is growing into a crescendo and he will be soon considered one of the best in the world.

‘Technically, he has all the skills. Messi is one of the best of all, but I’m sure Neymar will get to that level.’

There is an old newspaper saying: Dog bites man, no story. Man bites dog, big story.

But far from losing his livelihood or even liberty, Suarez arrived back in Uruguay following his ban after an unprovoked assault on Italian Giorgio Cheillini hailed as a national hero.

Indeed he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to Barcelona goes through.

Sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside down.

After all, his grandmother has been quoted as saying the FIFA ban was ‘barbaric’ and he has been treated like a, er, ‘dog’ as if HE has been the victim of rough, rough justice.

Talk about barking.  

Despite a lot of unpleasant baggage at this World Cup there is no doubt most of the football has been fantastic.

There have been the most goals at the end of the group stage since it became a 32-team tournament in 1998 – 136 at an average of 2.83 per game.

The lowest total in that period was the last World Cup, when only 145 were scored during the entire competition at a rate of 2.27.

No World Cup has averaged more than three goals a game since 1958.

The question is, now it is sudden death, will teams become more cautious? 

Well according to statistics it has been, er, Iran.

On the basis of 92 attempts in or around their goal, they unleashed 72 tackles, made eight blocks and there were eight saves.

But they still finished bottom of Group F with one point from a 0-0 draw with Nigeria, losing to Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Numbers Game: Statistically Iran have the best defence in the World Cup so far, yet exited in the group stages

So much for the having the best defence. Mind you, Iran’s goals for and against column (For one,  Against, four) was only marginally worse than England’s (also one point) of For two, Against four.

But it was sufficient for Carlos Queiroz to resign as manager – something Roy Hodgson has refused to do.

As the above shows, always beware of every stat and sometimes one can’t be quite sure how these things are assessed, but according to FIFA anoraks this is the World Cup best XI so far.

The stats XI: Enyeama (Nigeria), Chiellini (Italy), Van Buyten (Belgium), Medel (Chile), Alves (Brazil), Rodriguez (Colombia), Robben (Netherlands), Cuadrado (Colombia), Neymar (Brazil), Benzema (France), Messi (Argentina).

Inevitably, there have been some dodgy refereeing decisions, but there are always going to be honest mistakes.

Although there are some conspiracy theorists who say Brazil have benefited more than most from officials.

Under the spotlight: English referee Howard Webb will be in charge for the clash between Brazil and Chile

After all, could you imagine the furore among many already angst-ridden protesters about the cost of staging the tournament if Brazil hadn’t have got out of their group?

But in general, the match management of officials has been good and a lesson to some Premier League refs who are overkeen to issue cards.

So far there has been an average of just 2.7 yellow cards per game and 0.2 reds.

English ref Howard Webb goes under the spotlight on Saturday evening, taking charge of the Brazil Chile game.

With Suarez gone, Edinson Cavani – a possible target for Manchester United – takes on the role of lead striker.

But don’t underestimate former Manchester United forward Diego Forlan. He was joint top scorer at the last World Cup.

Even though he is now 35 and playing out his career in Japan he could still make an impact against Columbia.

Pressure: With Luis Suarez banned the pressure is on strike partner Edinson Cavani to step up and supply the goals

Let’s not forget what Suarez did at the last World Cup, cynically handling on the line to prevent a late winner for Ghana in the quarter finals. 

Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty – the sent-off Suarez celebrating on the sidelines – and Uruguay went on to win the penalty shootout. 

Brazil are 1-2 with most bookies to win but this could go to the wire. And 14-1 to be 0-0 is worth a look.

It could go to penalties on that basis and Brazil are 3/10 to qualify Chile 5-2
