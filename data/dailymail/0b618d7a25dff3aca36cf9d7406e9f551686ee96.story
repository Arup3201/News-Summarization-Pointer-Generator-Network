Fired: Oxford University graduate Calypso Nash was sacked as a librarian at St Hilda's College for not stopping 30 students performing the internet dance sensation the Harlem Shake

An Oxford University librarian has lost her job after students filmed themselves doing the latest dance craze on her watch.

Calypso Nash, 23, was dismissed from St Hilda’s College after a video that shows students noisily performing a ‘Harlem Shake’ in the college library appeared on YouTube.

The dance became an internet sensation last month when five Australian teenagers posted online footage of themselves gyrating to a song of the same name, by US artist DJ Baauer.

A petition has now been started by students, and the culprits, to have the librarian reinstated as she was 'not in the position to stop it'.

Ms Nash was working there that night but had nothing to do with organising the event and had not been asked if it could go ahead.

In the video, posted on YouTube, a group of around 30 students are shown studying quietly in the grand surroundings of St Hilda's.

Then a youngster dressed as an American footballer is seen dancing before the film cuts to all the students doing the Harlem Shake craze in fancy dress.

Another is dressed as a member of the jailed Russian pop group Pussy Riot, while others donned horses heads, a furry badger costume or appeared as weight lifters and a skier.

Some were seen dancing in the library aisles, while others were seen standing on chairs and on tables.

However, the 30-second long video clip, which has had more than 5,000 views, has sparked outrage amongst the senior staff members of the 120-year-old Oxford University College.

All the students who had been identified as taking part in the video have been fined by the Dean.

Librarian and graduate student Calypso Nash was sacked for not preventing the Harlem Shake taking place.

Oxford University said: 'This is a matter for St Hilda’s College, they say they do not wish to make a comment at this time.'

Today students want Miss Nash back in her job as she just happened to be there at the time and are also calling for the fines to be rescinded as they shot the video late at night as not to disturb anyone studying.

At St Hilda's Junior Common Room weekly meeting, students passed a motion calling for the immediate reinstatement of the librarian.

As a result of the vote the JCR president Esther Gosling is to 'ask for a written reason for the decision from the Head Librarian, and also to bring the matter to the attention of the governing body, calling in the strongest terms for Calypso to be rehired.'

Miss Gosling will also be writing to the Dean to seek the fines imposed being overturned because 'the Harlem shake did not cause a disturbance coming as it did at 11:30 pm on a Sunday evening - and that the event - only lasted roughly seven minutes.'

Ellen Gibson, a student at St Hilda's, said: 'The situation seems ridiculous.

'The Librarian had nothing to do with the protest; she just happened to be there at the time.'

Another Hilda's student said of Calypso's sacking: 'She was not in a position to stop them at the time'

JCR Secretary Katie Meadon said: 'We are not trying to deliberately undermine any decisions made by college authorities, but we, and the rest of the JCR, believe that the dismissal of the librarian in question was unfair. We hope that the college will take the JCR's opinions into account regarding this matter.'

Sacked Miss Nash studied Classics, Ancient Greek and Roman literature, history and philosophyfrom 2008 until 2012.

She is now a graduate at St Hilda's College after being awarded an academic scholarship.

She was also instrumental as part of a 12-man team that raised over £100,000 pounds as bursaries for prospective St. Hilda's College students in 2011.

A member of The Society of Young Publishers she is active in the Oxford University Orchestra and Sinfonietta. She lists her interests as publishing, customer communication, equal opportunities, moral philosophy, literature, classical and contemporary music.

Miss Nash has also worked as a customer services officer at Buckingham Palace when one of the Queen's official residents is open to the public.
