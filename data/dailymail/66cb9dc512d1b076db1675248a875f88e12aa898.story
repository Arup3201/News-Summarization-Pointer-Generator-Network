Ukraine's secret service claims to have arrested a Russian-led sabotage cell that planned to bring down a plane on Ukraine's Independence Day.

Kiev's SBU espionage agency said the saboteurs had conducted 'terrorist' attacks in the Kharkiv region, which has remained in government hands throughout the bloody seven-month conflict.

The group, allegedly found with an extensive stash of Russian-made weapons, planned to down a military plane on 24 August, Ukraine's Independence Day, it was claimed.

Busted: This picture released by Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency purportedly shows two members of a Russian-led sabotage cell that Ukrainian officials said had conducted 'terrorist' attacks in the Kharkiv region

Well armed: The SBU also released this picture of the stash of weapons the men were allegedly found with, including Kalashnikov assault rifles, grenades and ammunition

Images released by the intelligence agency showed pictures of two men in plain clothes, their faces blurred, under guard by Ukrainian soldiers.

The alleged cell was 'coordinated by the Russian secret services', claimed the SBU.

'On the orders of the Russian secret service, the criminals have worked out and tried to implement the terrorist attacks in strategic areas of the region,' a spokesman for the agency said.

'They were recruiting local citizens, supplied them with guns and other weapons.

'They have filmed their activities and reported to their leaders in Russia.

'On 16 August, SBU officers prevented the attack of this group on a law enforcement base. Six criminals were arrested, aged 21 to 53.

'Two short range anti-tank weapons were found.'

Heavy weapons: A shoulder-mounted rocket launcher the SBU said was found with the suspected saboteurs

Another piece of military hardware: It is alleged the group had been planning to shoot down a plane on Ukrainian Independence Day. The SBU claimed it had also found flash disks with video evidence of the plot

The group planned to down a military plane on 24 August, Ukraine's Independence Day, it was claimed.

The group had a stash of 'light anti-tank weapons, a Shmel rocket flame-thrower, two Kalashnikov machine guns, a Makarov hand gun, five hand grenades, seven grenades for grenade shooting guns, and many bullets.'

'Flash disks with video evidence was also found,' the SBU claimed. Russia has consistently denied arming separatist rebels in Ukraine, despite accusations from Kiev and its Western allies.
