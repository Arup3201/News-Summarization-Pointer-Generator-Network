The temperature is a balmy 25c; pulling my sunglasses over my eyes, I warm my face in the bright sunshine before taking a sip of sangria.

Aaaah, Barcelona - the perfect destination for a summer break. Except this is October and I'm not here to put my feet up. I'm on a mission to buy a new winter wardrobe and I've got another shop to visit.

Going abroad for a little retail therapy isn't something I've ever done before. I have a couple of glamorous friends who occasionally jet off to New York to stock up on the latest designer labels, but my budget has never stretched further than my local High Street.

Bagging a bargain: Clare travelled to Spain to see if she could save money on her winter wardrobe

Never mind the purchases you make when you get there, you have to factor in paying for flights and a hotel. Not to mention getting to and from the airport, travelling around the city, and eating.

But I've discovered that several clothing brands are much cheaper in Spain than in the UK. Zara, Massimo Dutti and Mango cost up to 39 per cent less in Espana than here at home.

Not surprisingly, they are all Spanish brands. Items are either manufactured in Spain or, if they're made further afield, channelled through Spanish distribution centres. If they don't have to travel on far then it's going to bring costs down. The exchange rate is also relatively advantageous and taxes tend to be lower.

But how much cheaper does this make it? I decided to see if I could buy a whole winter wardrobe - and pay for a return flight and a night in a hotel in Barcelona - for no more than the cost of buying exactly the same clothes in the UK.

I chose 13 key items - a work dress, party frock, trousers, skirt, winter coat, smart jacket, shirt, casual top, ankle boots, pair of smart heels, jumper, leather gloves and scarf. So can it be done?

Booking my flight five days before my trip, I discover I can fly Ryanair from my local airport, Stansted, to Barcelona’s main airport for £93.98.

Feeling quite pleased with myself, I turn my attention to a hotel. A frantic afternoon scrolling through myriad price comparison websites results in a booking at the Hotel Catalonia Park Putxet for £47. It's a four-star hotel, so I’m pleased with my bargain.

With the basics in place, off I set on an 8.20 am flight. Travelling with hand luggage only, I pack the bare essentials, so my bag is left virtually empty for my new purchases.

Luckily, while gloomy Britain is being drenched with rain, Barcelona is having an autumnal heatwave, so there’s no need to pack a coat.

Worth the trip: It's far cheaper to shop at Zara and Mango in Spain  

The exchange rate on the day I travel means one euro equals roughly 79p - or £1 = €1.26. A bus from the airport to the city centre costs €5.90 (£4.67) and once I'm there, a two-day travelcard to get me round the Metro costs € 14.40 (£11.40).

So far I've spent £158 - and that's without buying anything to eat. Can I cover it all in savings at the shops?

After dumping my bag in my hotel room, I head to the main shopping street off the Placa de Catalunya, Barcelona’s main square.

My first destination is Zara - owned, like Massimo Dutti, by Spanish retail giant Inditex. One of the UK's favourite stores, it's favoured by stylish women including the Duchess of Cambridge, who chose a floaty blue Zara dress the day after her wedding in 2011.

Here, I spot the perfect work dress - a dog-tooth-pattern shift with forgiving elbow-length sleeves. Figure-hugging but smart, it costs €39.95 (£31.63). In the UK, this dress would have set me back £49.99, so that’s a saving of £18.36 to start with.

Then I spy a navy blazer with a single brass button that will go with everything and is so classically chic, it’s surely one the Duchess of Cambridge would have her eye on if she wasn't expecting. This is €69.95 (£55.38), but in the UK is priced at £79.99, saving me £24.61.

Royal fan: The Duchess of Cambridge has worn Zara clothes on numerous occasions, including the day after she married Prince William when she wore this blue dress at Buckingham Palace

Now I'm on a roll. I spot a soft camel coat for €79.95 (£63.30) that would be £89.99 at home, saving me more than £25, a pair of comfy leather ankle boots for €69.95 (£55.38) that are £69.99 in the UK and a stripy top for €12.95 (£10.25). Unfortunately, a pair of silver kitten heels I'd coveted at home were sold out and the store is generally lacking in glam shoes, but a pink-and-black party dress with jewel embellishments is there for €49.95 (£39.52), a saving of about £20 on buying it in Britain, where it would cost £59.99.

While gloves are the last thing I need in sunny Barcelona, I try to remember I am putting together a 'winter' wardrobe. I imagine doing the school run on an icy December morning and pick up a pair of black leather gloves for €29.95 (£23.70). These are £29.99 in the UK.

My next stop is Mango. I've always thought of Mango as a store for the under-30s. However, I'm surprised to find a red jumper with pretty detailing. It's viscose and polyester, but at €19.99 (£15.82) is such a bargain it won’t matter if it doesn’t last. It’s less of a bargain back at home, though, where it costs £24.99.

While many of the skirts in Mango are too thigh-skimming for my liking, I find a knee-length black and navy pencil skirt for €29.99 (£23.75), which looks great with the sweater. On the British High Street, it would cost £34.99.

Sadly, there are no party shoes here either, but I find a cosy tartan scarf for €19.99 (£15.82). UK price? £24.99. As I'm about to pay for my items, I spot a display of sunglasses. They're not on my winter shopping list, but as one of the arms fell off my own pair on the flight over - and the sun is very bright - I treat myself to a pair of tortoiseshell specs. At €19.99 (£15.82), they're nearly a tenner less than in the UK, where they’re £24.99. By this point I’m too exhausted to shop any more and treat myself to a bowl of gazpacho soup, a roll and a small jug of sangria in a beautiful square off Las Ramblas - Barcelona’s tree-lined promenade. The cost is an eye-watering €17 (£13.45), but then I am in prime tourist territory.

Pays to shop in Spain: Items in Zara can be 39 per cent less than they are in the UK

After returning to my hotel to recharge my batteries, I spend the evening exploring in the vibrant squares of the Gracia area 15 minutes’ walk from my hotel. Dinner is tapas - what else? - and a beer for €25 (£19.79) before heading to bed for an early night.

As I've still got three items on my list to find, I’m in the hotel having cafe con leche and a croissant by 8.30 am, despite that breakfast is €8 (£6.33) extra.

Then it’s back on the Metro and once more to the shops. Massimo Dutti, which has 11 stores around the UK, is Zara’s older, more upmarket sister. But there are big savings to be made here, too.

A classic white stretch shirt with black piping detail will look great with the pencil skirt. In Barcelona it costs me €49.95 (£39.53), but in the UK is £54.95.

Meanwhile, a pair of dark red trousers are also €49.95 (£39.53) but would cost £54.95 at home.

And I find a pair of shoes that will be perfect for work and Christmas parties. The crocodile-skin-effect slingbacks are €89.95 (£71.17) - my most expensive purchase - but would have cost £89.99 at home.

Finally, I have everything - all 13 items, plus some bonus sunglasses. It's time to head back to the airport for my 2.35pm flight.

Of course, to avoid paying for check-in baggage I have to wear as much as possible. Piling on my blazer and coat when the temperature is 25c leaves me hot and red-faced.

At least, because I've been shopping in the EU I don't have to pay import duty. So did I manage to save enough on my shopping to cover the cost of my mini-break? When I tot everything up I discover - hurrah! - I am £3.89 in credit! Sun, sea and savings? It pays to shop in Spain.
