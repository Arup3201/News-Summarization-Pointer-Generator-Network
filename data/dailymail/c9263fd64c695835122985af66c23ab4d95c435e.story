Polish police received panicked phone calls after a London double-decker bus appeared to drive off a bridge in the capital Warsaw and plunge into the river below.

But what onlookers didn't know was that it was all part of stunt for a Bollywood film that was being shot in the city.

Producers of the film, called Kick, staged the incident as part of a car chase and closed off the Gdanski Bridge over the Vistula River.

Polish residents were panicked to see the No 10 London double-decker bus crash into railings off the bridge and plunge into the Vistula River... unaware it was all part of a stunt for a Bollywood film

Making a splash: Onlookers said they saw the bus on top of the bridge and wondered what a London Bus was doing in the middle of Warsaw in the first place, unaware it was part of a film

Onlooker Kasia Miechowicz, 22, said: 'I saw the bus on top of the bridge and wondered what a London Bus was doing in the middle of Warsaw. It didn't move at first but then it started up, and then just drove off and fell into the river.

'I was completely shocked and had no idea it was part of a film.'

But even though police were able to explain to most callers that it was part of a film, some complained about the hassle and cost of closing the bridge.

Local man Ireneusz Wysocki, 45, told local TV: 'They only paid £15,000 to close the bridge off, but how much was lost by people being late for work because of the diversion.'

Angry locals also set up a Facebook group to try and raise an equal amount of money to hold a mass barbecue on the bridge.

The film Kick is directed by Sajid Nadiadwala and stars Salman Kahan. It is a remake of a 2009 movie of the same name about a young Indian boy who turns to crime.

Production company spokesman Krzysztof Solek from Film Polska Productions said the price of closing the bridge had helped them beat off competition from London and Dublin to stage the scenes in Warsaw.
