Sunday trading laws are to be relaxed this summer in a move that could pave the way for longer weekend opening hours all year round.

George Osborne confirmed yesterday that he is to push through emergency legislation lifting the six-hour limit on opening hours for larger stores over eight weekends in July, August and September.

The move, which brought protests from Labour, church leaders and trades unions, is designed to coincide with London’s hosting of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Cashing in: Shops will be open around the clock for eight weeks beginning on July 22

The Chancellor, who will set out details in the Budget on Wednesday, said it would be an opportunity to try to stimulate the economy.

‘We have got the whole world coming to London and the rest of the country for the Olympics,’ he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘It would be a great shame, particularly when some of the big Olympic events are on a Sunday, if the country had a “closed for business” sign on it.’

But Mr Osborne faced a backlash over the speed of the move – which will mean emergency laws being rushed through Parliament in the next ten days.

Critics also predicted the Government would move to a permanent shift in opening hours, undermining family life for those working in retailing.

The Chancellor fuelled that suspicion yesterday when he said he was proposing ‘at the moment’ only a temporary change during the Games.

Under starters orders: The 2012 Olympic Games will take place between 27 July and 12 August

John Cridland, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, told Sky’s Murnaghan programme: ‘I think there is a big difference between a temporary measure to try and lock in some of the spending of the thousands and thousands of international visitors who will come to Britain during the Olympics on a Sunday and a permanent change.

‘If it is a permanent change we would need to consult a lot of people, the shops themselves and the workers in those shops, but a temporary change just for the Olympics – every little helps.’

Labour accused the Government of a ‘disgraceful’ failure to consult on the move.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘Today, on Mothering Sunday, there are mums at home with their kids because Sunday trading laws mean they can have the morning off.’

John Hannett, general secretary of shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: ‘Our members are vehemently opposed to any further deregulation of Sunday trading hours and the Government’s own consultation on this just last year showed that there is no widespread support from either retailers or the general public for change.

‘Any change would fly totally in the face of the Government’s commitment to be family-friendly. To suggest that the  legislation, which allows shops to open for 150 hours a week, means Britain is “closed for business” is ridiculous.’

Announcement: The Chancellor will set out his Sunday trading plans in the Budget this Wednesday

Mr Hannett said he suspected the Olympics was being used as a ‘prelude to permanent change’. He said Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has responsibility for the Olympics, had agreed to an urgent meeting on the issue tomorrow.

Under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, large shops over 280 square metres in England and Wales are restricted to six hours’ continuous trading between 10am and 6pm on Sundays and cannot open at all on Easter Sunday.

Some major retailers have been lobbying in Whitehall for at least five years for the restrictions to be torn up.

The stores argue that 7,500 jobs would be created, generating extra money for the economy and the Government through tax. Tesco, Asda, Ikea and the DIY chains have thrown their weight behind the campaign in the past.

But any change will alarm the owners of small stores, which can open all day on Sunday and benefit from the restriction on their large rivals.

Tory MP Mark Menzies, who tried to change Sunday trading law via a private member’s bill, said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ that the plan was now being taken up by the Chancellor. It would ‘send out a very powerful message that Britain is open for business’.

The MP for Fylde, who used to work in retailing, said about 1,700 extra part-time jobs could be created as a result at the giant new shopping centre near the Olympic park alone.

But a Church of England spokesman said: ‘The Church would strongly oppose any further attempts to erode the special nature of Sunday, which legislation still reflects.’
