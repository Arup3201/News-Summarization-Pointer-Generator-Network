The parents of murdered April Jones can at last begin to plan their daughter's funeral after an inquest into her death was concluded and her death certificate issued.

The five-year-old schoolgirl was snatched outside her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales, last October before being murdered by Mark Bridger.

The 47-year-old paedophile refused to tell police what he had done with April’s body - although officers did recover a few fragments of her skull from his fireplace.

Coroner Louise Hunt said she could not reach any conclusion which had not already been reached in the court case

The 17 tiny pieces of bone is all that her mother Coral and father Paul have left of their daughter.

They have said that not having her body or being able to properly lay her to rest has made their hell worse.

The inquest, which had been given 
special permission to proceed by the chief coroner in the absence of a 
body, was then opened and adjourned.

Although technically the file remains open, coroner Mrs Hunt said there would be no further proceedings.

The five year old was abducted on October 1 last year and killed by Mark Bridger. Now her family can finally hold a funeral for her following the inquest today

Following
the conclusion of today’s hearing, a death certificate can be issued 
and her death can be officially registered - allowing her family to have
an official funeral for her at last.

They have been denied that right until now after Bridger refused to say what he did with her body.

Mark Bridger has refused to tell police what he did with April's body

The
one-time lifeguard, who was also caught downloading child porn on his 
computer, claimed he accidentally ran over April and in the ensuing 
panic could not remember what he did with her body.

Powys Coroner Louise Hunt said she hoped the conclusion of April’s inquest - which now paves the way for her funeral arrangements to begin - would be a small comfort to the Jones family.

She said: 'I want to extend my sympathies for your terrible loss.

'There will be no further formal proceedings and I hope the coming to an end of them will give you time to allow you to deal with your grief.'

Attending the 10-minute hearing in 
Powys County Council’s Welshpool offices were Mr and Mrs Jones, who were
flanked by family liaison officers from Dyfed Powys Police.

They
listened earnestly as the force’s Detective Superintendent Andy John 
read a brief outline of the circumstances surrounding April's death.

Mr
John, who was the senior investigating officer in the case, said 
April’s family reported she had been abducted at 7.20pm on October 1 
last year - prompting a 'significant police response'.

He said: 'This resulted in the arrest 
of Mark Leonard Bridger on October 2. Following subsequent inquiries, 
Bridger was charged with the murder of April, child abduction and 
perverting the course of justice.

'This resulted in a criminal trial taking place from April 29 to May 30.'

The family plan to place the remains 
in a pink coffin and take them through the town of Machynleth, Powys, on
a horse drawn carriage.

Although no details were given of when or
where April’s funeral will take place, it is believed that mourners 
will be asked to wear pink, which was her favourite colour.

It also became a symbol of hope in the wake of her disappearance, with scores of pink ribbons being put up by townsfolk.

Hundreds
of people are expected to turn up to say their farewells to the little 
girl, with a possible venue being St Peter’s Church in Machynlleth.

Bridger was later convicted of all three counts and handed a whole-life prison term - meaning he will die behind bars.

Mr John said that April’s body had never been found, but she suffered a 'violent death'.

And on the 'balance of probabilities', the youngster died at Bridger’s remote home in Mount Pleasant, Ceinws, on the day she was abducted.

April's mother Mrs Jones, 41, told the Sun newspaper last week: 'Our hell this past year has been made worse because we did not have April's body.'

Local councillor Michael Williams said a funeral was the 'right and proper' thing to happen.

'I don’t think it will be a final goodbye but it will be another step in remembering all the wonderful times that the family had together,' he said.

'It will bring people together again in one place to remember the life of a little child that was taken so savagely from the family and community.'

The inquest follows an attack on imprisoned Bridger, who was reportedly slashed in the face by a fellow convict and murderer.

Juvinai Ferreira, 22, who is serving a life sentence pleaded guilty to wounding Mark Bridger in high-security Wakefield Prison when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court via video-link.

Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old just months after Bridger was jailed for life for abducting and murdering April, in Machynlleth, Wales last year.

No details of the attack were given in court last week and Ferreira will be sentenced on October 2.

According to reports at the time of the attack, which happened on July 7, Bridger needed hospital treatment to a face wound after he was slashed with a makeshift knife.

He was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched.
