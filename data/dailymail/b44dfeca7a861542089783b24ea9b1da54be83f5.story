Nick Clegg has been put on a secret diet to lose weight before the election.

Aides took to hiding biscuits from the Lib Dem leader to stop him putting on the pounds before polling day.

The undercover calorie counters have had such success that he has been praised for his new svelte figure, although they admit they have no idea what he eats at home.

Mr Clegg is not the first politician to seek to get in shape as polling day approaches.

But he could be the first who did not even know that the healthy regime had been imposed.

He has previously tried to get in shape through exercise, with kickboxing lessons and playing tennis credited with helping with his squeezed middle.

But officials in his Whitehall office grew alarmed at his appetite for biscuits during meetings.

A source said: "When you're Deputy Prime Minister you get offered lots of cups of tea. Your access to biscuits is very generous."

So aides imposed a ban on hobnobs, digestives and rich tea biscuits in his office, and claim it has had startling results.

In an interview last week, his trimmer figure was remarked upon. London’s Evening Standard noted how Mr Clegg ‘and lets his business suit flap open in the breeze, revealing a youthful figure with no sign of Whitehall sag’.

It is understood that Mr Clegg now accepts the biscuit ban during working hours, but it is not clear if he sticks to the rules around the clock.

‘There are no biscuits in the office, but who knows what he is having at home,’ a source added.

DAVID CAMERON: Has given up bread, as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight.

GEORGE OSBORNE: Shed pounds on the 5:2 diet, where he fasts for two days every week.

ERIC PICKLES: Once boasted that his secret to trying to lose weight was ‘no cheese, no chips, no seconds’.

NIGEL LAWSON: The former Chancellor, and father of TV cook NIgella, wrote his own weight loss guide - The Nigel Lawson Diet Book - which helped him to shed five stone in a year.

LORD FALCONER: List five stone on an unconventional diet of apples and Diet Coke.

A year ago Mr Clegg vowed to play tennis against anyone who would give him a game in a bid to get in shape.

In 2013 he revealed he had taken up kickboxing at a local gym to ‘get stuff out of my system’.

And four years ago he had a rowing machine installed in his office, holding meetings while wearing shorts and T-shirt.

A gruelling six-week election campaign gets underway on March 30, when party leaders will be expected to look their best as they criss-cross the country while surviving on a diet of service station sandwiches.

David Cameron has often spoken of his battle with his weight while in office.

At one point it was claimed the Prime Minister was experimenting with alternatives to standard milk, such as almond milk, which is low in calories and fat.

In January he revealed he had given up bread as part of his 'great patriotic struggle' with his weight, which involves cutting out carbs and running every other day.

He added wearily: ‘I can’t get away with it because people can judge pretty clearly whether the pounds have come off or gone on.'

Chancellor George Osborne has shed several stone after sticking to the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. It has also been the diet of choice for the SNP’s Alex Salmond.

Boris Johnson embarked on a New Year diet after tipping the scales at 16stone. 

‘I take on an almost unbelievable amount of exercise, but I have a bad habit of eating the children's supper for breakfast,' the London Mayor said.
