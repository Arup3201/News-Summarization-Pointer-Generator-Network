Teaching kids to ride a bike is a tricky business.

And showing them how to brake and stop can be equally challenging.

But now a company has designed a new product that can stop them riding into danger with an automatic brake.

The MiniBrake, pictured, is a device designed to keep your child safe by slowing their bike to a stop

Called MiniBrake, the $80 (£50)  device is a remote-controlled bike brake system.

It is composed of two parts, a remote control for the parent and a small brake on the rear of the bike.

Using the control, a parent can stop their kid heading for danger.

The product, the company claims, brings the bike to a safe and smooth stop.

This ensures that, even if travelling at speed, ‘your kid will not fall over when the brake is applied,’ they say on their Indiegogo crowdfunding page

The makers must raise $75,000 (£45,000) in order for production of the device to begin, however.

The brake stops the bike when a parent presses the button on the remote control or when it goes out of range.

When switching on the product, it automatically tests itself for right operation.

The product automatically stops the bicycle when the batteries run out.

When reaching the 164ft (50m) range, the product automatically stops the bicycle

As an extra safety measure, when anything blocks the signal 
between the remote control and the bike, the brake is automatically 
applied.

A moving bike is safely and smoothly stopped approximately within 20in (50cm).

The product automatically switches off when the bike is not in use to 
avoid batteries running out of power due to an unswitched button.

The product contains a 'black box', which logs all braking events.

To install the device an Allen key is needed to screw it onto the back of small bicycles.

A simple friction brake is then raised or lowered to slow the bike.

The brake is lowered when the parent pushes the button on the remote control if, for example, they feel their kid is heading for danger.

The range of the brake is 50 metres (164 feet) but, if this is exceeded, the brake is automatically applied to prevent the child riding off.

In addition, if the brake runs out of battery it will stay attached to the wheel so that the bike can’t be ridden any more.

They say it is suitable for children up to a weight of 77lb (35kg).

‘Throughout the development and testing phases, we have consulted with moms, dads and their kids to make MiniBrake the perfect child safety product,’ the company says.

‘Children aged two to five are learning new skills extremely fast.

‘However, sometimes they are quicker in learning how to ride the bike than they are in perceiving dangerous situations.

When the button is pressed (left) the brake is applied (middle) and the bike comes to a halt (right)

‘Or even if they notice a threat, they are not skilled enough to avoid accidents and stop safely.

‘Thus, parents often feel that while riding the bike is super fun, they must protect their children at all times.

‘Helmets, elbow- and knee protectors are extremely useful, but they can only mitigate the effect of a collision – in contrast, MiniBrake is used to avoid bike accidents.

‘MiniBrake is a unique solution that actively prevents accidents.

‘With the help of a simple remote controller, parents can intervene and stop their kids in order to avoid bike accidents.

The company is now seeking funding and beginning production of the product, with it expected to roll out in May.
