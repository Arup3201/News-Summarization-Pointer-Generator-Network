Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown has sparked more rumors that he is seriously considering running for office in New Hampshire after taking part in a polar bear plunge over the weekend.

The Republican has been actively playing coy with voters and political analysts in recent months, but he stripped the issue bare in his most recent move.

A picture of the shirtless former Senator made the front page of the local newspaper as he took part in the Hampton Beach, New Hampshire annual Penguin Plunge that raises money for the Special Olympics.

Shirtless Senator: Scott Brown took part in this weekend's Polar Plunge at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire, where he is reportedly considering running for Senate

Enjoying the area: Brown has been a longtime summer resident of the state but doesn't normally spend much time there in the winter

Patriotic option: When he did finally put on a shirt, he made sure it was one that showed his American spirit

While everyone else wore long-sleeved
 t-shirts, 54-year-old Brown showed off his physique in spite of the 
cold weather as the temperature ranged from 32 to 44 degrees throughout 
the day.

This is not the first time that the Republican has stripped down for a cause, as he once posed for Cosmopolitan while he was a student in an effort to help pay for law school.

When
 he did cover up at Sunday's race, he made clear that his patriotic 
roots are still intact, as he posted a picture of himself wearing an 
American flag sweatshirt while standing next to two men dressed in full 
walking-dead garb as part of the plunge's zombie theme.

Scott's
 appearance surely helped him raise some of the $600,000 that the event 
collected for the Special Olympics, but it also did some good for his 
future political aspirations.

Defeat: Elizabeth Warren bumped Scott Brown from the Senate seat in 2012 (seen here during the campaign)

Competition: If he chooses to run in New Hampshire, he will be facing Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who has held the seat for the past two terms since 2002

After winning a Massachusetts special election in 2010 following Senator Ted Kennedy's death, Brown left the Senate two years later when he was beaten by Democratic challenger, Elizabeth Warren.

Warren is now seen as a Democratic rising star on the national stage, and the chances of being re-elected in her left-leaning state are fairly high.

In turn, Brown has been spending more time at his vacation home in Rye, New Hampshire.

Aside from the lovely scenery, it is also convenient that the state's Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen is up for re-election this year.

While signs might be pointing to a possible senate run, Brown- who signed on as a Fox News contributor after being voted out of office- has kept hinting at his viability as a presidential candidate in 2016.

Back in the day: Brown's 1982 Cosmo centerfold helped him pay for law school

Happy husband: At Christmas, Brown shared this picture of he and his wife Gail Huff
