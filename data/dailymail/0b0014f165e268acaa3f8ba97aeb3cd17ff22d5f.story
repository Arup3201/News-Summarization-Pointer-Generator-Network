Artist Clive Cooper knows how to use his melon when it comes to carving sculptures out of fruit.

By day he is a full-time government clerk, but by night he transforms everyday watermelons into works of art.

Having perfected his skills carving pumpkins, Clive says the fruity faces are so life-like because of his painstaking attention to detail.

But there is just one problem, he has to work fast because they last just 24 hours before they shrivel up and lose their shape.

Clive, 54, said: 'I used to carve pumpkins but I couldn't achieve what I really wanted to because the insides don't have enough structure.

'I like to use watermelons because they have green, white and red colouring where as with pumpkins you only have orange to work with.

Stunning: He says the possibilities are endless and will keep going until he 'exhausts them all'

He said: 'I love the creative process you can make just from a piece of fruit.

'I've done loads already but the possibilities are endless - I'll keep going until I exhaust them all.'

Clive, who works as a full-time government clerk, has been asked to carve the watermelons for weddings and parties as decoration.

The Grinning Man': He says watermelons are refreshing because you can carve them all year round - you can only really work with pumpkins for Halloween

He said: 'People like to have something special and unique at their celebratory events and it's nice to be able to give them that from something I enjoy doing so much.

'Watermelons are refreshing because you can carve them all year round - you can only really work with pumpkins for Halloween.

'And they're much more delicious than pumpkins to eat - we eat a lot of watermelon in my house!'
