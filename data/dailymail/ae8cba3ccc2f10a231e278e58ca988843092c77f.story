Now that he has retired from the france national team, Samir Nasri is taking full advantage of the international break by cosying up to his girlfriend on a boat in Ibiza.

The Manchester City playmaker announced his retirement from France after a fall out with  manager Didier Deschamps saw him controversially omitted from Les Bleus 2014 World Cup squad.

So, while his former teammates laboured to a 1-1 draw away to Serbia in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying game, Nasri passed his time by appearing to re-enact Chris Isaak's Wicked Game video with stunning girlfriend Anara Atanes.

Atanes probably didn't help her boyfriend's international cause after publicly blasting Deschamps for leaving Nasri out of the squad by tweeting: 'F*** france and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!

'Incase you didn't read my tweet properly.... I'll repeat myself..... f*** FRANCE!!!!! And f*** Deschamps!

'Let's just get this straight! I'm not mad I get my bf for two months.... I just think there's a level of respect to be had!'

Nasri was disregarded by France despite winning a domestic double with his club and the late withdrawal of Franck Ribery.

The 27-year-old should return to the Etihad fully refreshed ahead of the Premier League champions clash with his former club Arsenal on September 13.
