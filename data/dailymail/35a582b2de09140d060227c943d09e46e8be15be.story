Dead: A 4-year-old girl in west suburban Aurora was killed Sunday evening after a TV fell on her, police said

Investigators say the girl's mother and a younger sibling were home at the time of the accident shortly before 6 p.m.

The family had just finished dinner and the girl's mother was tending to the 2-year-old in the kitchen area when Cyliyah went into the family room and tried to climb a stand in order to activate the cable box on top of the television, Aurora police Sgt. Tim Ciochon said.

The set was an older model weighing 108 pounds and came down on top of her, police said. 'It was just a tragic accident,' Ciochon said.

The mother told police that the television had fallen off a stand and onto the child, police said. The home was occupied by the girl, her mother and a younger sibling, police said.

A investigation and autopsy indicated the girl's death was accident as she died from severe head injuries.

Emergency: Police were called to police to the apartment in the 1200 block of Nantucket Avenue in Aurora, Illinois

Her tragic death is far too common. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 215 children were killed by falling television sets from 2000-2011.

And in just the two years between 2009 and 2011 43,200 people were treated for injuries from falling sets.
