Former glamour model Peta Todd joined an elite group of drivers to complete the punishing World Rally Championship finale after a difficult weekend.

The wife of Mark Cavendish was involved in a crash on the first competitive day of action at Wales Rally GB, and that was just one of a number of problems she and team-mate Tony Jardine faced.

The pair also suffered punctured tyres and faulty wheel bearings and finished the event in 47th place.

Cavendish was clearly impressed with his wife's achievement.

He said: 'I'm so proud of Peta this weekend. She's come so far since her first co-driving experience just a few weeks ago, and what she's overcome just to start Wales Rally GB. Her determination to finish is a stubbornness I know all too well.'

The former model added: 'It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions, not just over the last three days but for the entire campaign. I won’t lie, it’s a great shame we weren't able to be a little more competitive in our class but I've come to learn that in rallying nothing is predictable. We could run the rally again right now without all the problems we had or have even worse luck.

'All of the team have been amazing and we wouldn't have finished without the ProSpeed guys working through both nights so a massive thanks to them and everyone else involved. 

'Personally I've been pushed to the very edge, but the admiration I now have for the rallying world is second to none. Thank you to all the fans that lined the stages. It’s an experience I will never forget.'

Jardine paid tribute to his co-driver after a gruelling few days of competition in which they encountered a number of problems.

'Peta has been a rock throughout this rally,' he said. 'Despite all the setbacks, she has kept her cool and hasn't let anything get to her. Her mental state is as good as any of the top co-drivers and, considering how far she has come in just eight weeks, she could really go on to be an even better co-driver if she wants to.

'I'm very sorry that I cost us a higher finish with the crash on Friday, as well as a couple of other mistakes, but she can be so proud of her performance to get us here. I'm so pleased to have crossed the line. It has been the toughest rally I think I've ever done.' 

World champion Sebastian Ogier led from start to end to win his eighth race in 13 this year, finishing 37.6 seconds ahead of Finland's  Mikko Hirvonen.
