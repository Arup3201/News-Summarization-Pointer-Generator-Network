For some people, a holiday is a chance to expand their horizons – or shake off the working world with a week of fun, activities and exploration.

But for Britons, it seems, a trip away is about doing as little as possible.

A new survey has found that British 
travellers are among the laziest on the planet when it comes to 
holidays, preferring lethargy and relaxation to any sort of exercise.

This will do me nicely, thanks: More than nine in ten Britons just want an easy life while on holiday

The Flip Flop Report – an annual survey compiled by travel booking company Expedia – has revealed that the UK is the third least active nation on the planet when it comes to time off.

Citizens of only two other countries – Japan and Thailand – rank as less likely to do anything constructive with their place in the sun according to the research, which looked at the travel habits of people in four different continents to provide a worldwide picture.

And, according to the results, over nine out of ten Britons – 92 per cent – just want an easy life when they go on holiday, and will pick a quiet destination.

Perhaps surprisingly, only 13 per cent of British holidaymakers say they feel excited at the thought of partying while on their big summer break.

This is in stark contrast to Brazilians – 87 per cent of those questioned from South America’s biggest country say they expect big nights out during their break.

Less than one in five Britons – 19 per cent – say they can be bothered to go swimming or surfing, or take part in other watersports when they are on the beach.

Other countries ‘outed’ as lazy travellers include South Korea, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, which help make up the top ten.

The survey also reveals the top ten most energetic nations when it comes to travel.

India, Mexico and Malaysia form the top three on this score, with honourable mentions for Austria, Brazil, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Hong Kong.

The study took in the opinions of 11,165 respondents, aged 18 or over, in Europe, North America, South America and Asia.

All respondents had taken a beach holiday in the last 12 months – or are planning to take one in the next year.
