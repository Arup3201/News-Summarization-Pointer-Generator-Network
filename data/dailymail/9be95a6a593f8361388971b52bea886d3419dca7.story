When sportscaster Bob Costas appeared on air to cover the Sochi Olympics with a swollen left eye last week, his assistant said it was a 'minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend'

Well, the weekend has come and gone and the pinkeye is only getting worse - having now spread to both eyes.

On Tuesday, he spoke on Today, saying he was going to take the night off to heal since he can barely see.

Poor Bob: The pink eye in the sportscaster's left eye spread to both eyes by Monday night of Olympic coverage. He announced he would be taking Tuesday night off

Sore: Costas, pictured left last Thursday without his glasses, said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red
 'as the Soviet flag'

'I might as well be playing Marco Polo, I have no idea where I am,' Costas said.

Today anchor Matt Lauer will fill in for Costas tonight.

His infection was so bad he broke the news to the Today show crew over the phone, even though he could have appeared in person since they're broadcasting live from Sochi.

Costas last appeared on air Monday night during NBC's late night coverage of the Olympics, hosted by Mary Carillo.

Carillo had just done a package on vodka production in Russia, and Costas came out to take a shot with the former tennis player.

Before clinking their classes, Costas joked: 'My eyes can't get any redder. No matter what I do.'

'Tomorrow morning I'll be lying on a curb in Minsk,' Costas added after taking a swig of the hard alcohol.

The two joked that it was the 'Kathie and Hoda' portion of the show - poking fun at the Today co-hosts who drink wine during their fourth hour show.

Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb responded this morning by taking sympathy shots for Costas as he heels.

Apparently Hoda was told that the shots were actually water, and gasped in surprise when she downed the shot only to realize it was real alcohol.

Costas contracted the eye infection in Russia, before the start of the Olympics.

Costas hasn't publicly stated what kind of infection he's suffering from, but it seems to be a case of pinkeye.

Also known as Conjunctivitis, pinkeye is an infection of the mucus membrane that lines the eyelid - causing the eyes to become red and inflamed.

Pinkeye is most commonly contracted from a virus which can spread through person to person contact or contaminated water.

Doctors suggest thorough hand-washing as the best way to prevent getting the infection.

Conjunctivitis can also be caused by bacteria, lack of tears, chemicals or allergies.

It is not a serious infection and usually clears up within 7 to 10 days.

While bacterial pinkeye can be treated with antibiotic eye drops, ointment or pills - viral pinkeye usually doesn't have a specific treatment.

Costas' left eye was decidedly red, watery and swollen behind glasses as he took to the air last Thursday night. During the broadcast, he addressed his new look.

'Bear with me for a moment as I spare my 
friends in the press office countless inquiries,' he said.

'I have no choice to go 
all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple of nights since I 
woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red
 as the old Soviet flag.

'According to the NBC doctors here, it's some 
kind of minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend. If 
only all my issues would resolve themselves that quickly, but that's 
another story.'

His assistant added to Deadspin that the infection has left it impossible for Costas to wear contact lenses.

Following the primetime broadcast, the
 eye became a trending topic on Twitter, spawning numerous jokes and 
even a parody account.

Some users poked fun at the disasters that already unfolded before the opening ceremony even began.

'Bob Costas left eye will eat his right one if he keeps drinking that Sochi water,' one quipped.

Another
 added: 'Sochi highlights so far are inhumane living conditions, stray 
dogs and Costas' pink eye. It's a proud moment for Russia.'
