Transfer deadline day has been as hectic as ever, but how are Liverpool getting on?

Since Valdes is a free agent, Liverpool have the luxury of being able to sign Valdes after the transfer window is closed. Waiting a month or so before signing Valdes will allow Brendan Rodgers to assess the goalkeeper's fitness first before committing to any deal. 

Valdes has won six La Liga titles and three UEFA Champions Leagues with Barcelona, as well as a FIFA World Cup and European Championship with Spain.

SEBASTIAN COATES LATEST

Sebastian Coates has joined Sunderland on loan for a season and will link up with fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet.

Coates has only started six Premier League games in three seasons at Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers is happy for Coates to seek first time football and experience at Sunderland. 

Both teams benefit from this deal, as Sunderland capture a player named Copa America 2011 Young Player of the Tournament, whilst Liverpool will see Borini spend another year developing in the Premier League

FABIO BORINI LATEST   

QPR had a bid of £10million accepted by Liverpool for Fabio Borini, however the transfer is now off after a breakdown in talks.  

Meanwhile, earlier on Sunderland appeared to be frontrunners for Borini's signature, but that deal has also broken down due to the Italian forward's price tag.  

Whether or not any deal for Borini will be finalised by the end of the window remains to be seen.

OUSSAMA ASSAIDI LATEST

Moroccan winger Oussama Assaidi is close to joining Stoke City on loan as replacement for the injured Peter Odemwingie. This deal looks imminent.

DANIEL AGGER LATEST

Agger is back in his former club's colours for the first time since 2006 as the Danish defender officially completes his £3million move to Brondby.

The 29-year-old central defender moves to the Danish side for £3million after eight years at Anfield.

The Denmark international has made 232 appearances for the Merseyside club, but has only lifted a single trophy - the 2012 Carling Cup at Wembley. 

Back home: Daniel Agger has signed for former club Brondby in a £3million deal from Liverpool
