The White House formally responded to a petition demanding an investigation into TV host Jimmy Kimmel on Sunday, after he aired a controversial segment where children joked about killing 'everyone in China.'

The statement noted that the government 'cannot force ABC to remove this show' after a furious reaction to Kimmel's 'racist' skit and an online petition which secured over 105,000 signatures.

This volume of complaints guaranteed that the petition, which compared the sketch to Nazi Germany, would receive a statement from the Obama administration.

Debt solution: 'Kill everyone in China,' a six-year-old boy said during Jimmy Kimmel's 'Kids Table' segment on October 16. The sketch created widespread anger

'Racist': Kimmel's oft-repeated gag involves posing serious questions to a group of giggling elementary school children, but this 'joke' was greeted with outrage and compared to nazi Germany

'America owes China a lot of money – 
$1.3 trillion. How should we pay them back?' Kimmel asked a group of 
four giggling kids in the October 16 broadcast segment.

'Shoot cannons all the way over and kill everyone in China,' offers a six-year old boy. Kimmel also asks the group of children: 'Should we allow the Chinese to live?'

One
 girl protests that the Chinese might respond in kind against Americans,
 but two others counter that 'they're going to all be killed' first.

The broadcast created outrage, including demonstrations outside Kimmel's studios and the October 19 petition that stimulated the official White House response.

Fury: The White House petition collected over 105,000 signatures, putting the ball in the administration's court and triggering a guaranteed response

Offensive: Chinese-American protests descended on an ABC broadcast affiliate in Houston, Texas to protest the show and ABC's 'fake apology'

Thank you for your petition. Your petition requested an apology from those involved, and to 'cut the show.'

The parties involved have already apologized independently. Jimmy Kimmel has apologized on-air, and issued a written apology. ABC has removed the skit from future broadcasts, taken the clip down from online platforms, and detailed several changes in its programming review process in response to this incident. You can find more about Jimmy Kimmel's apology here, and ABC's apology here.

On a broader level, as the President has stated publicly, the United States welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of China. The comments you are writing about do not reflect mainstream views of China in the United States.

The Federal government cannot force ABC to remove this show. The First Amendment of the Constitution protects free speech, even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful. It may be upsetting when people say things we might personally disagree with, but the principle of protected free speech is an important part of who we are as a nation.

If you think this issue merits additional scrutiny, you may file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission by visiting FCC.gov/Complaints. The FCC is an independent agency that regulates the airwaves without input or consideration from the White House.

The online petition launched by an 'H.Z.' in Cedar Park, Texas declared that 'the kids might not 
know anything better.

'However, Jimmy Kimmel and ABC’s management are 
adults. They had a choice not to air this racist program, which promotes
 racial hatred. The program is totally unacceptable and it must be cut.'

The
 petition's text also compared the children's wisecracking to 'rhetoric 
used in Nazi Germany against Jewish people. Please immediately cut the 
show and issue a formal apology.'

Yesterday's answer from the White House, stated that the 'parties involved have already apologized independently.'

'We offer our sincere apology. We 
would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese 
community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community 
at large,' the ABC network said in an October 25 statement.

Kimmel himself personally apologized to about
 100 protesters who gathered outside his Hollywood, California studio, 
some carrying signs that showed his face with a Hitler mustache.

Too far: Kimmel has pushed the comedy envelope for years, once co-hosting 'The Man Show,' a Comedy Central program that ended each week with a montage of girls jumping on trampolines

Chinese-American groups held additional protests in at least five other 
cities.

The White House statement continued: 'The United 
States welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of China. The comments you 
are writing about do not reflect mainstream views of China in the United
 States.'

The 
administration's response then referred to the U.S constitution in 
stating: 'The Federal government cannot force ABC to remove this 
show.

'The First Amendment of the Constitution protects free speech, even
 if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful.

'It 
may be upsetting when people say things we might personally disagree 
with, but the principle of protected free speech is an important part of
 who we are as a nation,' the response added.
