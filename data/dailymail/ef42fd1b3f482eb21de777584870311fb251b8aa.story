Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli may not have had too many reasons to celebrate since his move to the club.

But the fiery Italian is certainly showing the world that he is up for the fight if his latest Instagram post is anything to go by.

The former AC Milan striker is filmed having a playful bout with Armenian-Italian kickboxer Giorgio Petrosyan as the duo waste time while on a train.

Both characters are seen smiling as they go one-on-one with Petrosyan stopping short of kneeing the striker at one point in the video.

Balotelli helped book his side a place in the FA Cup quarter final draw as Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

It was the Palermo-born striker's freekick that fell to Adam Lallana who grabbed the away side the lead as they thought from a goal down in south London.
