Plea: Gary Boote admitted assaulting police constable Michael Corner when he hit the policeman with his car before driving away with the officer clinging on

A driver ploughed into a policeman before speeding off with the officer still clinging to the bonnet of his car during a terror ride through a town centre.

Police constable Michael Corner was trying to get motorist Gary Boote to pull over and approached the car, only for the 23-year-old to drive into the officer and then reverse as the police man grabbed the bonnet.

Boote then headed through the centre of Bolton, Greater Manchester - with Pc Corner holding on to the Toyota Corolla for dear life.

Boote had been driving through the 
town with false number plates, and appeared to be obeying Pc Corner's 
instruction to pull over when the incident happened, Bolton Crown Court heard.

Ian Metcalfe, prosecuting, told the court that at one point the Toyota with Pc Corner still holding on, came close to another vehicle, before the officer released his grip and fell off.

Pc
 Corner was taken to hospital and treated for knee injuries, but was not
 seriously injured in the attack, which was caught on CCTV.

Boote had been seen driving dangerously through Bolton before the incident on September 9 last year, but Pc Corner and his colleague were unaware of that when they attempted to stop him.

Boote admitted assaulting Pc Corner with intent to resist arrest, having previously admitted dangerous driving on the same day.

Judge Timothy Stead told Boote, of Halliwell, Bolton, that his case was being adjourned for sentencing to take place on June 6. He was granted bail until then.

'That is not to be taken, by you, as an indication of what will happen on the day of sentence,' said the judge.

Shock: Boote had been driving through the town with false number plates, and appeared to be obeying Pc Corner's instruction to pull over when the incident happened
