A would-be bride accused of driving a knife through her fiancé's heart on their wedding day last year has been convicted of murder.

A jury in Allentown, Pennsylvania found Na Cola Franklin guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday, according to reports.

Prosecutors said Franklin and her fiancé, 36-year-old Billy Brewster, got into an argument early in the morning on August 11, the day they were supposed to be married.

Police said they found Brewster bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am in the home they shared with three children.

Murder: Na Cola Franklin, left was convicted of killing her husband-to-be Billy Brewster, right, after stabbing him twice in the heart during an argument at their home

Defense attorney John Waldron says Brewster went home to their Whitehall Township apartment drunk after an impromptu bachelor party.

He claimed that Brewster attacked Franklin and then tried to leave with the couple's 9-month-old son.

Waldron argued Franklin, 32, grabbed a knife to protect her child.

But prosecutors say that the child was not in danger, and claimed that Franklin showed no signs of being assaulted by Brewster.

Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his wife Monique - who were staying at the home with his wife for the wedding - testified that Franklin was the one being violent, and they never saw Brewster hit her, The Morning Call reported.

The couple said that after returning to the apartment shortly after 
midnight, they overheard an argument between Brewster and Franklin.

Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children

When
Mr Kali went to see what was going on, he got in between the fighting 
couple and tried to break up the argument. Mrs Kali only entered the 
fight when she heard someone scream 'knife'.

After
seeing blood on the left side of Brewster's chest and her husband 
standing in between Brewster and the knife-wieldling Franklin, Mrs Kali said she 'instinctively tackled' the woman.

During the episode, an injured Brewster crawled to the outdoor landing of the home, where police found him when they arrived on the scene.

He was transported to Lehigh Valley Hospital and was pronounced dead at 3.24am.

The jury of fivewomen and seven men deliberated for just three hours before returning a guilty verdict, The Morning Call reported.

Scene: The fight took place inside the apartment around 2am on Saturday morning, just eight hours before the couple were due to be married
