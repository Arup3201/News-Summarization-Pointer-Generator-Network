Traffic Droid: Lewis Dediare patrols the streets of London on the look out for bad drivers

This self-styled cycling superhero has been naming and shaming errant drivers using seven video cameras mounted on his helmet and bike.

Clad in black lycra, Traffic Droid, aka Lewis Dediare, describes his battle as a 'war of attrition' as he cycles around London, branding drivers 'idiots' if they get in his way.

As well as a camera mounted on a three foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle, the 39-year-old carries a ruler to measure how his distance from cars, before bellowing into the car window to admonish the driver and showing them a 'red card'.

He then uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter, and will often hand it over to traffic companies and police so the drivers can be further punished.

Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers, which features some of the countries most persistent complainers, and the call centre staff who have to deal with them. 

So far, Mr Dediare says his naming and
 shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every 
year, as well as several prosecutions.

The
 telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 
when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane
 while out cycling.

He broke
 two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the 
driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more 
needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to 
cyclists.

He now drives a modified bike, which features a camera on three-foot pole protruding from his handlebars, and as well as a further camera his helmet carries three bright lights.

Mr Dedaire films his journeys to and from his office, cycling as much as two hours a day, before uploading his footage when he gets home in the evening.

In tonight's Channel 4 programme he is shown alongside a car, armed with a ruler, to demonstrate to a driver how much space he should leave passing cyclists.

He is also shown telling drivers they are 'idiots' and warning 'you can kill a cyclist the way you are driving'.

Warning: Mr Dediare rides a modified bike featuring a camera on a pole protruding from his handlebars, and carries a red card which he shows to motorists

'If you do something wrong I have the invincibility of the law which I feel protects me and that's why I confront people with the law,' he told programme makers.

But Traffic Droid admits that not all drivers are welcoming of his advice, and he says he has often been threatened by motorists.

'It's a war, a war of attrition,' he said.

'One has to be prepared to combat that.'

Alongside Traffic Droid, tonight's episode of The Complainers also features those working inside the Tfl complaints centre, and those they deal with - including an obsessive tweeter and a bus driver  sent on a course known as 'the naughty boys club'.

Future episodes will focus on the call centre workers, social media teams and frontline staff who tackle irate customers at businesses and local councils.

Viewers will meet one of Britain's most persistent long-term complainers, who confronts Kirklees council with a camera strapped to his body as part of an ongoing dispute dating back to 1988, a man who complains several times a day about rubbish in Croydon and a complainer in Cardiff who patrols his neighbourhood daily on the hunt for vandalism and disrepair.

Traffic Droid features in The Complainers on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm.
