Morrissey has really got my goat today.

What does a 53-year-old male, over-rated Eighties pop star know about morning sickness?

How dare he say that, 'Kate Middleton was in the hospital, as far as I could see, for absolutely no reason'.

The Smiths' frontman Morrissey, left, said no blame had been placed the Duchess of Cambridge, right, for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, an accusation Tracey Blake finds 'despicable'

Does he not believe that feeling constantly nauseous and being unable to hold down food or water is quite bad for your health?

Has he got a medical degree that we are unaware of and does he dispute that such a condition as hyperemesis gravidarum exists?

Perhaps he'd like to try enduring chronic flu-like conditions - I imagine this pampered pop star would be calling the emergency services before you know it.

Even more shockingly, he appears to be trying to blame Kate for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who put the hoax call through at the hospital where Kate was receiving treatment. This is despicable.

Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, leave the King Edward VII hospital on 6 December

Poor Kate is in the fragile early stages of pregnancy and was forced to announce it when she fell ill and felt there would be too much speculation if she remained silent, she doesn't need idiots like Morrissey wading in with accusations that are likely to raise her stress levels even further.

Let's not forget that this is man who has form for  piddling on people's bonfires.

Earlier this year, while we were all caught up in Olympic pride and joy, he slammed the ‘blustering jingoism' of London 2012 and even compared the support of athletes to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s.

The Manchester-born star said, 'I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. The spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand Britain.'

Benedict Barboza, the widower of nurse Jacintha Saldanha - who was involved in a hoax call concerning the Duchess of Cambridge at King Edward VII hospital - wiith their children Lisha, 14, and Junal, 17

Clearly the man has a very warped perception of the world. But it also smacks of a desperate clamoring for headlines, a conscious decision to court controversy.

I am faintly proud that I have disliked him and his faux whacky, attention-grabbing efforts since his Eighties heyday.  When I was about eight years old I saw him dancing around the Top of the Pops stage with plants sticking out of his trousers - I immediately dismissed him as weirdo who wasn't worth listening to.

I only hope that Kate can take a similar attitude.
