Just like Tatler's Little Black Book list or the Forbes Rich List, InStyle's annual Best Dressed chart is a hotly contested list, with editors and fashion writers agonising over who should land the top spot. .

And this year, the title of InStyle's best dressed woman was awarded to Hollywood actress Emma Stone.

The 24-year-old pipped Kristen Stewart, Cheryl Cole and even the Duchess of Cambridge to the top spot.

The list, compiled by the InStyle's fashion team, features 50 of the most stylish women on the planet and saw Spider Man's leading lady receive great fashion plaudits for her dazzling red carpet looks.

In close second position came Diane Kruger, while sultry vampire Kristen Stewart took third place.

Flying the flag for the British were style icons Alexa Chung, Victoria Beckham, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Moss and Florence Welch, all securing five of the top ten places.

Youngest to make the list was Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' six-year-old daughter Suri Cruise, who came in at number nine.

No stranger to best dressed lists, the budding fashionista is a regular poll topper in both child and adult categories.
