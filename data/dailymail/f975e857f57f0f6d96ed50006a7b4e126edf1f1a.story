Attorney General Brad Hazzard has attacked the decision for ex-Bega Cheese CEO Maurice Van Ryn to be bailed after he admitted a string of child sex charges.

Van Ryn, 59, faces up to 25 years in jail after pleading guilty to the offences which involve boys and girls as young as eight, and spanning almost a decade.

Mr Hazzard has called for an urgent review into the decision by Bega Local Court magistrate Doug Dick to grant bail, reports The Daily Telegraph.

Attorney General Brad Hazzard has attacked the decision for ex-Bega Cheese CEO Maurice Van Ryn to be bailed, calling for the bail conditions to be reviewed

He said in a statement: 'Having read some of the alleged facts I am extremely concerned about the decision to grant bail.

'I have contacted the Director of Public Prosecutions and asked the DPP to urgently review the circumstances and consider lodging an appeal against the granting of bail.' 

Van Ryn was granted bail despite the crown prosecutor saying he could flee, he was given bail to have assessments done and go to a wedding.

Van Ryn was issued strict bail conditions, including having to report to Merimbula Police Station five days a week and giving up his his passport. 

A spokesman for the DPP Lloyd Babb, SC, reportedly said a decision was yet to be made on whether to appeal the bail decision.

Van Ryn's abuse came to light when he was was charged in September after an investigation by Bega detectives and the Queanbeyan Child Abuse Squad officers.

He appeared at Bega Local Court on Tuesday and Van Ryn was charged with 23 matter.

Twelve of the charges were replaced with the more serious charge of 'persistent sexual abuse of a child' which carries a much longer sentence, reports The Telegraph. 

Van Ryn, of Merimbula, was released on strict bail conditions but the crown prosecution argued he had the means to leave the local area and so could abscond.
