The Speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, faced questions last night over why he gave a parliamentary pass to a friend of his wife.

Wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor Farah Sassoon has since donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’s bid for re-election.

Tory MP Rob Wilson is demanding to know why access to Parliament has been granted to Mrs Sassoon, who was pictured last year cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow.

John Bercow is facing questions about why Mrs Sassoon has a pass to enter Parliament

The official register of MP’s interests shows Mr Bercow has received £5,000 from Trust Reservations, the Labour-supporting company run by Mrs Sassoon.

The firm has also given £2,385.84 to Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

The Guido Fawkes blog reported that Mrs Sassoon has also received a pass for her to ‘bypass security checks into Parliament’.

However, Mr Bercow is being challenged about why the pass was granted. 

A parliamentary pass gives the holder full access to the high-security Palace of Westminster estate. They are given to MPs, aides, journalists and staff who work in the Commons and the Lords. 

Passes – which are granted only after a full security check – are prized because they allow the holder to wander unaccompanied around the estate and gain access to MPs and officials, as well as restaurants and bars in Westminster. 

Mr Wilson, Tory MP for Reading East, has written to the Speaker to ‘raise the concerns of several of my constituents’.

Mr Wilson adds: ‘Integrity, accountability and openness, are part of the seven Nolan Principles of Public Life which are enshrined into Parliament by their inclusion in Code of Conduct for MPs.’

He sets out several questions, including why Mrs Sassoon was given a Parliamentary pass, what kind of pass it was when it was issued and when expires.

The letter asks what was ‘the intended purpose of her company’s donation to your office and whether Mr Bercow consulted with ‘with any of the Parliamentary authorities, such as your foremost adviser, the Clerk of the Commons, on the propriety of accepting a donation having issued this pass’.

Mr Wilson demanded answers from Mr Bercow by this Friday, noting that he has given Mr Bercow the opportunity to respond before considering referring the matter to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

Mrs Sassoon is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns. Their daughter Sophia is a star of Made in Chelsea.

In October Mrs Sassoon was pictured leaving an awards ceremony with Mrs Bercow and the pair are thought to regularly party together. 

A spokesman for the Speaker said: 'For security purposes, House officials do not confirm names of pass holders. However, the Speaker would like to confirm that his wife applied for a pass for a female friend in 2012. 

'It is not unusual for residents living on the Parliamentary Estate to be able to apply for passes for close friends and family. All applications go through security clearance checks.

‘Farah Sassoon made a donation to ‘the Speaker’s seeking re-election’ campaign fund on 7 June 2014 (it was accepted on 1 July 2014).

‘The donation was towards the Speaker’s re-election fund, not to his office. As you are aware, the convention that the Speaker is independent of party dates back to the mid-18th century. 

'When a Member of Parliament becomes Speaker of the House she or he resigns from his or her political party and run as an independent candidate under the banner of ‘the Speaker Seeking Re-Election’. 

'The donation is for this purpose, and is listed as being so in the Register of Members’ Interests under ‘Sponsorships’, in accordance with the rules.’
