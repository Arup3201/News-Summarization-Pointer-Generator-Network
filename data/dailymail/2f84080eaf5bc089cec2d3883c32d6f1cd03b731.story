An upstate New York college this month made a student remove a Confederate flag from his room – which he says is a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

Matthew Papay, 19, and a Sophomore at the University of Rochester, also claims school administrators lied when telling students he choose to take it down – he was forced, he says.

‘The deans lied in the email about why I took it down — saying I did so by choice after discussion with fellow students — when in reality the school told me to take it down,’ he told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle.

Rights violated: Matthew Papay claims the school forcing him to remove the flag violated his right to freedom of speech

From North Carolina, Mr Papay told the paper he hung the divisive flag in his window as a way of celebrating where he grew up.

‘I am from North Carolina and the school is blatantly ignoring my rights to express the cultural identity I choose to identify with, even though the school prides itself on how 'culturally diverse' it is.’

Administrators have backtracked from their initial statement, which was emailed to every student, telling the paper he had incomplete information about the circumstances surrounding the flag.

The school’s dean claims a graduate house advisor who forced the proud North Carolinian to take down his paper flag ‘misspoke’ and that it should have been allowed to stay, the paper said.

The Confederate flag, first used by the South in the Civil War, has since come to represent slavery, bigotry and other discrimination that happened then and continued to happen among groups such as the Ku Klux Klan.

The administrator continued explaining himself, adding that ‘the whole purpose of higher education is to get ideas out there that sometimes are unpalatable.’

Not racist: Mr Papay claims the flag represnts his heritage, not racism

Mr Papay first put an actual Confederate flag in the window of his residence hall room three weeks ago, he told the paper.

He was promptly told to take it down by a student advisor who claimed it was a fire hazard. The advisor said the flag acts as a drape, which is not permitted, Mr Papay told the paper.

After consulting with a local fire marshal over a paper flag, which he was assured would not violate regulations, he put the replica in his window – it was also condemned.

‘I understand that your flag is up out of pride and you can feel free to leave it up but on a wall of your room,’ the advisor said in an email.

‘"It should not be in the window because of the discomfort it is causing people and because it does not necessarily represent the heritage of the whole house,’ she added.

The sophomore started a Facebook group regarding the flag, and gave his side of the story. Most agree he is not racist, but there was division over the message sent by the flag.

‘There is obviously a lot of people who take offense at the Confederate flag,’ one student wrote on the group’s wall.

‘I am surprised by it and not happy to hear about it,’ another student wrote. ‘I would expect this at another school.’

One student, though disagreeing with the message it sends, said that ‘if I want certain rights to be given to me, I shouldn't take away others' rights.’

Other students that wrote racist comments have been summoned to the dean’s office, but aren’t expected to face discipline.

Mr Papay is free to fly his confederate flag.
