In the 1973 cult horror movie The Wicker Man, the pagan residents of a remote Highlands village end up sacrificing a devout Christian policeman as an expression of their religious freedom.

More than 40 years later, developers who are planning to buy the last remaining church in the village where the film was made should hope the real-life locals don't feel inclined to take inspiration.

The congregation of Plockton Church in the far north west of Scotland are furious at plans by the Church of Scotland (CoS) to sell their last place of worship.

Ominous: Edward Woodward as Sergeant Howie in the 1973 film The Wicker Man which was partly filmed in the Highlands village of Plockton

The village where Robin Hardy filmed the classic tale once had four churches and open-air communions have been held to mark important Christian occasions for centuries.

The religious tension over the fate of the last-remaining church, built in 1823, is all the more palpable because the followers are part of a breakaway group which split from the CoS in the the mid-19th century known as the 'Wee Frees'.

They have been leasing the church for the last 20 years - but are now set be left homeless after CoS bosses decided it should be sold.

Villagers believe it will follow a similar fate of other churches and be turned into flats by a property developer.

They are all the more angry as it is unclear whether the graveyard will be included in the sale.

Under threat: Plockton Church is set to be sold by the Church of Scotland after being deemed 'surplus to requirements'

Charlie MacRae, who lives in the same Plockton home he was born in 75 years ago, told The Guardian: 'Over 20 years ago the local free church was sold and turned into flats... It would be a disaster if Plockton Church went the same way.

'The community would also like to know what will happen to the graveyard as it is unclear whether it will be included in the sale.'

He added that local people would try to raise funds to buy Plockton Church if it goes on the market, but fears thy will be outbid by developers.

But Rev Roddie Rankin, from Plockton Church, said he was 'hopeful'Â  services will continue.

A CoS spokesman told The Guardian: 'Sadly the building is surplus to the congregation's requirements and as such is being sold.

'The Church of Scotland has corresponded with representatives of the local community council regarding the sale of the church and with the local free church congregation who are using the building for public worship. No final decision has been made about the future ownership of the graveyard.'
