Jenna Bush is clearly in love, and with such an adorable baby daughter who could blame her?

The former presidential daughter, 31, shared a gorgeous photo on Instagram of baby Mila who, at 11 months old, is just weeks away from her first birthday.

The snap, which shows Mrs Bush Hager holding beaming daughter Mila, is captioned; 'The happiest hour of my day.'

Happy New Year! On 1 January 2014 Mrs Bush Hager posted this adorable snap on Instagram, of her holding 8-month-old Mila, captioning the picture; 'Life's a beach! Happy 2014!'

Mrs Bush Hager and husband Henry, a former Whitehouse aid, became parents, with Mila, on April 13 2013.

Mila - whose full name is Margaret Laura, in honor of both her grandmothers - is the first grandchild for former president George W Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush.

And this is not the first time Mrs Bush Hager has taken to the popular photo-sharing site to post pictures of her with her daughter.

She has posted a number of pictures on Instagram, including one of Mr Bush himself holding his granddaughter, as well as numerous other snaps.

The latest one has already had 2,258 'likes' from fans around the world.

One user wrote: 'She has those beautiful Bush eyes!'

She loves an Instagram! On December 31 2013 Mrs Bush Hager posted this picture of her and a laughing baby Mila. The picture was captioned; 'This darling, a babe of 2013 has brought me so much joy! Feliz Ano Nuevo!'

Mrs Bush Hager has fully embraced motherhood and appears to be able to juggle her hectic work schedule with home life.

Earlier this year on her blog, The Novo Project, she revealed she couldn't stop staring at her daughter's 'little, precious hands.'

She also marked her first Mother's Day in May, tweeting tender family snaps of the newborn at home in New York.

Expressing
 her love for little Mila, she wrote: 'I've learned that you can love 
somebody in a totally different way.

'I'm close to crying, of
 course, you know me. I'm totally crazy about her.'

And she said of husband Henry: 'He
 was taking a conference call while holding the baby yesterday.

'We're just having so much fun.

'He read the first book to 
her that Don Nash gave us. I cried.'

The couple got married in 2008, and she announced her pregnancy in December 2012 on-air during the show.

For the new mom, family is of utmost importance; her twin sister, Barbara, was there when Mrs Bush Hager's water broke unexpectedly at her baby shower, and she has made no secret of her love for her 'gramps' - George Bush.
