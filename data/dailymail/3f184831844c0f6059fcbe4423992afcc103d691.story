Two transplant patients died after receiving kidneys from the same alcoholic donor - which had already been rejected as 'unfit' by several other hospitals, an inquest has heard.

Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor. 

Mr Stuart, from Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, both underwent the operations at the University Hospital of Wales last year, where they were given kidneys infected with the deadly parasitic worm halicephalobus.

Post-mortem examinations revealed that both men had the parasite in their bodies. Cardiff Coroner's Court heard that there have only been five known cases like this worldwide in humans - all of which have proved fatal.

Both men died of meningoencephalitis, an inflammation of the brain caused by the parasite.

The inquest was told by relatives of both men that they had been informed that the donor's organs had been rejected by several other hospitals after being deemed 'unfit for transplant' - but they were only told after their loved ones had already died.

Mr Hughes's father, Ian, told the hearing he would not have signed the consent form for his disabled son had he known the organ came from an alcoholic.

He said: 'I ended up signing Darren's death warrant.

'I thought the donor was a person who had died in a car crash locally. We knew nothing about the donor's lifestyle.

'The first time we knew anything was wrong was after Darren's death.'

Mr Hughes said: 'After he died we were told that the donor lived rough, was alcoholic, had cirrhosis of the liver and that they didn't know the cause of the meningitis that killed him.

'We find it difficult to understand why the hospital in Cardiff used these kidneys. They had been rejected from all other hospitals - all his other organs were considered unfit for transplant.' 

That sentiment was echoed by Mr Stuart's widow Judith. She said her husband, who needed dialysis after suffering septicaemia, had been in good health before being bumped up the waiting list.

'He coped very well on dialysis,' she added. 'He was very upbeat about the future and would have been happy to stay on dialysis for the rest of his life.

'He was in surprising good health for someone who needed a transplant.

'The nurses (on the transplant ward) once joked to him 'What are you doing here, you're in far too good health, you shouldn't be here'.'

Mrs Stuart added she had been told nothing about the donor - disputing accusations her husband had been told.

'I maintain my husband did not properly consent to the operation,' she said.

The hearing was told Mr Stuart was told his donor had liver cirrhosis 'while in theatre' before being given anaesthetic.

Mrs Stuart said: 'Even if this conversation did happen I do not think he would have been aware (of what was going on).'

Acting coroner Christopher John Woolley said both the men had a transplant at University Hospital Wales last November.

For Mr Hughes, it was his third transplant, while it was Mr Stuart's first.

But following a successful operation, Mr Hughes's condition began to deteriorate and an initial diagnosis of viral meningitis was made.

He died on December 15.

His father said: 'Our opinion was that Darren was not going to improve and he was being used as a guinea pig.'

Mr Hughes senior said he had a meeting with health officials the following month and was told 'all other hospitals had rejected' the donors' organs - including eyes, lungs, liver and heart - because they were considered unfit for transplants.

Mr Stuart's wife, Judith, said her husband had twice been told a transplant match had been found, only for the operation to be cancelled.

At 2am on November 30, he was told a new match had been found.

'I was told the operation went very well and the kidney was scanned in recovery,' Mrs Stuart said.

'He continued to make good progress and was passing urine.'

He was discharged from hospital on December 6 and attended a follow-up appointment four days later.

Later that day Mrs Stuart said her husband became 'very confused'.

She said: 'He kept asking where his father was - even though he had died years ago.'

He was then readmitted to hospital, where he was sent to intensive care. 

He died on December 17. 

The inquest heard no post mortem had been carried out on the donor following his unusual death before his organs were offered for transplant.

The inquest also heard the organs of the donor had been rejected by every hospital they had been offered to before they were accepted by the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff.

The kidneys had been described in documents as 'poor function'.

Mr Hughes told Cardiff Coroner's Court about the final desperate days of his son's life as the parasite in his infected kidney.

He said: 'Darren couldn't feel his legs, couldn't control his bowels and was coming in and out of consciousness.

'He said: 'Dad I am frightened, I am scared, I don't know what is happening. No more hospital Dad, I have had enough'.'

Mr Hughes said he asked how his wife Andrea was before slipping into a coma which he never came out of.

A representative for the University of Wales Hospital suggested that the surgeon had told them prior to the transplant that the donor had died of a brain infection which was low risk.

Mr Hughes said: 'No, that is not true, that is false.'

The inquest was told the halicephalobus parasite lives in soil, manure and compost. Its occurance is rare in animals - although it can be found in horses.

Acting coroner Mr Woolley heard neither of the men who died had had contact with horses prior to their death. 

The inquest continues.
