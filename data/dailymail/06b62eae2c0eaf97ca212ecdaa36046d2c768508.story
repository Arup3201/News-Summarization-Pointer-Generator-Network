Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is back at work just two months after the birth of her son, cutting her maternity leave short to begin her new show tomorrow.

The mother of three hopes her new 9pm time slot for 'The Kelly File', which debuts on the 17th anniversary of the Fox News Launch, will be more family friendly.

'I
don't miss being on the air,' she said. 'But there is a part of me that
is not present when I'm on maternity leave and it's good to see that 
part of me return when I go back to work. My husband said he could hear 
the vibrancy in my voice.'

Debut: Megyn Kelly's new show 'The Kelly Files' on Fox News Channel will kick off on Monday

Kelly gave birth to son Thatcher on July 23.

She said her new schedule will allow her to work from home in the morning and head to the office in the
afternoon. It means her husband gets the three kids, ages 4 and under, 
during the cranky hours when they're getting ready for bed.

On
her second day back at work last week, having adjustment problems, she 
brought baby Thatcher (and a baby sitter) in with her. Despite the short
maternity leave, she said she's happy to be back.

Kelly said she is looking forward to hosting a new show, which is very different to the edgy news show she had been hosting in the afternoon.

'If you watch O'Reilly, you hear a lot about what Bill O'Reilly thinks,' she said. 'Sean Hannity, same thing. But you're not going to hear what I think.'

'The Kelly File' is the linchpin to the first overhaul of Fox's prime-time lineup since 2002, a century in television time.

Starting Monday, Hannity moves back an hour to 10pm to make room for Kelly at 9, Greta Van Susteren shifts to 7pm and Shepard Smith becomes a roving news anchor making appearances throughout the evening.

At the time of the last schedule change, when Van Susteren moved to Fox from CNN, the now 42-year-old Kelly was an unhappy Washington lawyer.

She began reporting news for a local Washington station on weekends in 2003.

A year after that, she was noticed and hired by Fox News chief Roger Ailes.

Kelly
said she hasn't been pressured to make changes for the move into the 
evening, where a larger audience is usually available. Her afternoon 
show averaged 1.2 million viewers a day before her maternity leave, 
while Hannity reached 1.9 million at 9 pm.

'I've
never wanted to be an opinion host, and Roger Ailes hasn't wanted me to
be an opinion host,' she said. 'I don't think I'd be very successful 
anyway. I'm not an ideologue, and I think you have to be successful in a
prime-time opinion-based show. I think I'm too moderate and 
reasonable.'

Kelly has cultivated an image of speaking up in ways that run counter to Fox's image.

She
marched off the set on Election Night to interview Fox's numbers guy, 
minimizing the embarrassment when Karl Rove questioned the declaration 
that President Barack Obama had won re-election.

Her legal training helped Fox correct, quicker than rivals, an initially wrong report on the U.S. Supreme Court's health care decision. She expressed disgust at a man's suggestion that children of working mothers don't fare as well as children with stay-at-home moms.

Yet on a day-to-day basis, the stories that she selects and emphasizes have made her show one that Fox's primarily Republican audience can feel comfortable with.

'What Megyn has done for us is create a new style of hosting and a new style of doing a show,' said Bill Shine, Fox's executive vice president for programming. 'I think she's fair, she's nice. But I think if you're going to try to BS her ... if she smells it and she catches it, she's going to call you on it.'

With a less strident approach at 9pm, Fox's hope is to attract some younger viewers, maybe some women.

'I don't want to infer that (the schedule change) is being done to correct a negative,' he said. 'It's being done because we felt with these changes we would remain No. 1 and possibly be No. 1 by a larger margin.'

Kelly said her evening show will be sharper, faster and to the point. She is keeping Tom Lowell, her executive producer when she was on the 1pm to 3pm shift, in the same role. The daytime show often used news stories as launching points for discussions with two or three commentators.
