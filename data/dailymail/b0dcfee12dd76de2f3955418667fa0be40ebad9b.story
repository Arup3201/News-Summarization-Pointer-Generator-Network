David Cameron made the extraordinary claim yesterday that North Korea could attack Britain.

The Prime Minister said he knows Communist dictator Kim Jong-un has access to missiles that can hit the UK.

The threat showed that Britain must keep its Trident nuclear deterrent to combat ‘nuclear blackmail’, he said.

David Cameron described dictator Kim Jong-Un's behaviour as 'worrying and threatening'

But his claims were immediately 
disputed by experts who say North Korea does not have missiles that can 
reach Europe –  and cannot mount nuclear warheads on them either.

And they sparked comparisons with the claims made by Tony Blair to justify invading Iraq ten years ago.

Mr Blair produced a ‘dodgy dossier’ 
on Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. It falsely claimed that
 Iraq could hit British targets with chemical weapons in just 45 minutes
 and was used to fuel the rush to war.

Hackers broke into Pyongyang’s social media sites yesterday and posted a picture showing leader Kim Jong-un with a pig’s snout.

North Korea uses its Uriminzokkiri website’s Twitter feed and Flickr stream to send out regime propaganda, such as photos of Kim Jong-un with military chiefs.

But as tensions rose on the Korean peninsula, these halted yesterday. Instead, one showed a picture of Kim’s face with a pig-like snout and a drawing of Mickey Mouse on his chest. Underneath, the text read: ‘Threatening world peace with ICBMs and Nuclear weapons/Wasting money while his people starve to death.’

Another posting said, ‘We are Anonymous’ – the name of a hacker activist group. A statement purporting to be from the hackers claimed that they had compromised 15,000 user records on Uriminzokkiri.com and other sites.

The Prime Minister has warned that it would be 'foolish' for Britain to consider abandoning Trident because the country faces an increased threat of nuclear attack from regimes including North Korea

David Cameron, speaking with Commander John Livesey RN, said he will firm up his longstanding commitment to a £20billion like-for-like replacement for the submarine-based Trident nuclear deterrent

Mr Cameron spoke out after North 
Korea warned the ‘moment of explosion is near’ and declared its military
 has been cleared to attack the US mainland with nuclear weapons.

As the tense stand-off and war of 
words in the region intensified, the US admitted intelligence reports 
showed the North could be planning to launch mobile ballistic missiles 
in the coming days and weeks.

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Kim 
Kwan-jin said Pyongyang’s military had moved to its east coast a missile
 with ‘considerable range’ that could threaten US bases in the region as
 well as Japan.

On a visit to Scotland, Mr Cameron 
branded Kim Jong-un’s behaviour ‘worrying and threatening’ and said 
North Korea has ‘extremely dangerous technologies’.

He added: ‘The fact is… North Korea 
does have missile technology that is able to reach us. They can hit the 
whole of the United States.

‘If they are able to reach the whole 
of the United States they can reach the rest of Europe too – they can 
reach us too. That is a real concern.’

Maintaining the UK’s submarine-based 
Trident nuclear deterrent was a necessary ‘insurance policy against the 
risks that there are in the world’, he said.

But international security experts last night cast doubt on his extraordinary claim about the threat posed by North Korea.

They said Pyongyang’s most powerful 
weapon – test-fired in December – has a range of 3,700 miles. It can 
reach no further than Alaska, and certainly not the UK.

Mark Fitzpatrick, director of nuclear
 non-proliferation and disarmament at the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies think-tank, said: ‘The Prime Minister was certainly 
correct as to the growing nuclear threat from North Korea and the 
uncertainties of the future.

‘But North Korea does not have any 
missile capabilities that could hit Britain and it is difficult to 
envision circumstances when North Korea ever would want to attack the UK
 even if they could.’

Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘North 
Korean missiles would be lucky to reach South Korea given their previous
 record. There’s as much truth in this claim as there was in the claim 
that Iraq could hit British interests in 45 minutes.

‘This is clearly utter fiction and wild exaggeration. It is desperate scaremongering.’

While experts do not believe North 
Korea has the capacity to strike at the US mainland, American bases in 
South Korea, Japan and the Pacific island of Guam could be within range 
of Pyongyang’s conventional missiles.

Washington has responded to the 
mounting crisis by moving mobile missile defence shields to Guam, while 
F/A-18 Hornet fighters are being moved to the Philippines.

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel acknowledged that North Korea is a ‘real and clear danger’.

On Tuesday, Pyongyang announced it 
would restart a plutonium reactor it shut in 2007. A US research 
institute said satellite imagery shows that construction needed for the 
restart has begun.

Diplomats and regional analysts 
believe Kim’s sabre-rattling rhetoric and threats to restart his nuclear
 programme could be part of a strategy to gain concessions from other 
nations and to win much-needed political credibility among his troops 
and people.

However, the fear is that the young, 
inexperienced and potentially reckless leader is in danger of setting 
off a chain of events that could lead to conflict.
