All eyes might have been on Chris 
Huhne’s ankle, to see whether he was wearing his ‘jewellery’ – jailbird 
slang for the tag that allowed him to walk free from prison after 
serving just a quarter of his eight-month sentence.

Instead, they were irresistibly drawn to the waistband of his scruffy jeans, which presented an altogether different question.

Perish
the thought, but wasn’t that a bit of paunch hanging over the 
58-year-old former Cabinet minister’s belt? Just how tough was the 
regime in one of Britain’s comfiest prisons? And doesn’t it have a gym?

It was a still-to-be-tagged and slightly fuller-figured Huhne that emerged yesterday.

Not
a broken, beaten man returning gaunt and shame-faced, but a casually 
dressed ex-con marshalling photographers and attendant police officers 
along a narrow street to a small park near his home in Clerkenwell, 
central London.

Lunchtime sandwich-eaters are 
accustomed to pesky squirrels, not the circus a grey-haired figure in a 
bomber jacket was now conducting.

Somehow
the disgraced ex-Energy Secretary managed to walk straight into the 
lunchtime news to take centre stage in what we may fairly assume was 
episode one of the ‘other things to offer’ Huhne claimed to have up his 
handcuffed sleeve before being driven off to prison two months ago with 
his political career and much of his personal life in tatters.

Chris Huhne’s ex-wife is to publish a book based on the diaries she kept during her recent two months in prison, her publisher said.

The book, Prisonomics, will be published in early September, Biteback Publishing revealed. The book is not said to be a full memoir, but will draw on diaries the economist kept during her period in prison.

The new book will use a style similar to Pryce’s previous publication Greekonomics, and is said to be a very personal book examining prison life, but also a hard-hitting economic analysis of the cost to the economy of keeping women in prison. Pryce said: 'I am pleased Biteback will again be publishing a book of mine. I kept a diary while in prison and I have some strong views on how the prison system works, especially with regard to how it treats women.'

‘We’ve
got to move – we’re causing an obstruction!’ he shouted after 
discovering that his arrival by taxi had caused the road to be blocked 
by journalists and spectators (and he wouldn’t want to break the law, 
would he)?

Hand in hand 
with his bisexual partner Carina Trimingham, he told everyone to ‘calm 
down’

He then added: ‘I would just like to say once again, as you know 
from the night I was sentenced, I said that I was very sorry for what I 
had done.

‘It has been a humbling and sobering experience.

'I
would like to thank all of those who have written to me – hundreds of 
letters that I have had – and all my family and friends who stood by me.

‘And I would also just remind you that I have served only part of my sentence and therefore it is not appropriate to say more.

'I would now like to get on, get back to home, and continue with my life.’ 

Out: Disgraced politician Chris Huhne leaves prison in Gloucestershire 
today after just 62 days behind bars, shortly after his ex-wife Vicky 
Pryce was also set free and returned home to London (right)

Freed: Huhne was taken away by car at around 7am and driven to his London after two months away

The
entire show lasted less than three minutes before the front door of the
£1.2million home he shares with 45-year-old Miss Trimingham slammed 
shut.

Miss Trimingham had come fresh from 
taking a law exam nearby, an irony upon which no-one remarked. 

She said
the curfew would be in effect immediately and would operate from 7pm to
7am.

‘We’re looking forward to a few dinners in,’ she said chirpily.

The
electronic tag came a few hours later, courtesy of a visit from 
security specialists who attached it to his leg and installed a control 
and monitor box at the house.

Huhne had been met by his father Peter after being released on licence from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire.

Prison spell: Huhne and Pryce were convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to eight months each in jail

Ten years of deceit came to an end in 
March when Huhne was jailed for eight months with ex-wife Vicky Pryce 
after finally admitting passing speeding points to her.

Yesterday
she too returned to her home, in Clapham, South London, after being 
released from East Sutton Park prison near Maidstone, Kent.

Pryce, who will also have to wear a tag, told reporters the first thing she planned to do was have a cup of coffee.

As he breathed in his first lungfuls of air as a free man,
Chris Huhne would be forgiven for caring not a jot about the clothes on his
back.

But clearly some thought had gone into the outfit, because
the disgraced Lib Dem politician and erstwhile jailbird made his foray into the
free world wearing a jacket far more trendy than any politician would usually
have the style nous to wear.

And, unlike his jeans, it looked to be brand new.

Crime against fashion or hipster cool? Chris Huhne in his retro Harrington... and, right, how he usually looks

More usually found in a wool overcoat or dull suit, for his big reveal, Huhne had thrown on what looked to be a box-fresh Harrington jacket over his button-down blue shirt.

Since the Sixties, the short cotton Harrington, with its
checked Fraser tartan lining and button-up collar, has been the unofficial
uniform of mods, scooterboys and skinheads.

Indie bands like Blur and Oasis
adopted the look in the 90s – and now we can add Chris Huhne to the list of well-known wearers.

A lookalike Harrington from dapper-menswear.com on sale for £80 (and styled, as Huhne would have been advised to do, with a navy polo shirt)

They sell them these days at Lambretta, or on websites with names like Modrophenia, Dapper-menswear or Hipsteruk (does Huhne know he's a hipster now?).

It was a daring style statement from a man we are more used to
seeing in a tailoring.

And he could have pulled it off if it weren’t
for that pesky shirt.

For while the aforementioned cultural trailblazers wore their
Harringtons with a Fred Perry polo shirt or a pin-sharp checked Ben Sherman,
the former energy secretary paired his retro jacket, rather
schizophrenically sartorially speaking, with a thoroughly modern, sober blue work shirt and brown office shoes.

Swap that anodyne shirt for a natty polo and
the shoes for some DMs and he would have been onto something.

Hell, he could
have gone the whole hog and sped out of Leyhill on a Vespa (on second thoughts, speeding would be ill advised).

PS: As for Carina Trimingham: her blue leather jacket looked
to have been plucked from the bottom of a bin bag before she put it on this
morning.

As a PR adviser, she is surely aware of the importance of public image. Could
do better, Ms Trimingham.
