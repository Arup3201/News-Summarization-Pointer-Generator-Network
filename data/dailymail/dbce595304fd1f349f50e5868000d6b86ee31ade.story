The son of Manchester United’s legendary manager Sir Matt Busby believes that his father would be delighted with the appointment of Louis van Gaal as the club’s new boss and he has even backed the Dutchman to win the Barclays Premier League this season. 

Busby Snr won five league titles, two FA Cups and one European Cup during his stint in charge at Old Trafford but he is most fondly remembered as the founding father of the modern Manchester United, introducing philosophy of attacking football and reconstructing the club after the Munich air crash. 

When asked by Sportsmail if his father would enjoy Van Gaal's brand of football, Sandy Busby burst into a wide smile, saying: ‘Oh, I’m sure he would. I’m sure he would. And please God he does.

'This club is enormous, it’s an enormous club.

'It’s got a great support throughout the world and it would be great to see Mr Van Gaal succeed and I’m sure he will.

'From the way he’s talking, he’s going to play attacking football and that’s all we want.

'It’s what this club stands for.’ 

Van Gaal heads into Old Trafford tasked with the responsibility of restoring United to their former glories after a traumatic campaign under David Moyes, but Busby believes that the Dutchman can lead the club to the Premier League title in his first season.

‘It was very hard to replace my dad and very hard to replace Sir Alex. I won’t say anything against David Moyes, no way, but it was tough. 

‘I think great things could happen with Louis. And I do (think they could win the league). Seriously. If he is going after the players they are talking about, I might go down to the bookies and have a good bet on them to win the league. Maybe the FA Cup as well but the league will do nicely thank you!’

Busby was speaking to Sportsmail at the National Football Museum, where he was joined by his family and closest friends for the move premiere of the film Believe. It is a work of fiction that sees Sir Matt come out of retirement for one last coaching mission, to bring through a group of young kids in Manchester in the 1980s to compete in a junior cup competition. 

One of 
those present was Manchester United legend Denis Law, part of the club’s
 Holy Trinity, and he added his voice of backing to the Van Gaal 
appointment. 

‘Everybody
 is looking forward to it and the main thing is to get back into the 
Champions League and I’m certain that will happen, at least. I don’t see 
it any other way.

'It will be difficult but he will know the players he requires. I just know he will get it right.

'He will see where there is a possible weakness and I’m sure that with all his pedigree, he will do really well. 

‘But
 we should never forget this club’s roots. People will always remember 
Sir Matt. Even the young fans, from their dads and their grandads, they 
will know the name Sir Matt Busby. He made the club what it was.

'The first English club to go into Europe and the first to win the European Cup. 

‘Now, of course, it’s up to Louis to take us back into Europe!’
