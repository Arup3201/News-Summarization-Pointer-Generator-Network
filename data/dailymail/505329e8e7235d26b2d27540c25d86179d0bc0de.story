An elderly couple accused of illegally possessing 271 artworks by Pablo Picasso worth up to £80 million are to appear in court in France.

Pierre Le Guennec, 75, and wife Danielle, 72, from Mouans Sartoux, near Cannes, claim the artist's last wife Jacqueline gave them the treasure trove of works while Mr Le Guennec was working at Picasso's house as an electrician in the 1970s.

They claim on one occasion, Mrs Picasso handed them a box crammed with paintings and sketches and said, 'Here, this is for you'.

The couple then kept the hugely valuable horde of art stashed in their garage in southern France for 40 years.

They were arrested after they took a suitcase crammed with canvases to the painter's heirs in Paris in 2010 to have them authenticated.

Within days of art experts proving the works were genuine, police swooped on the elderly pair at their home  and arrested them on suspicion of receiving stolen goods.

They were released without charge while an investigation was launched to establish how the couple had come by the paintings, but eight months later they were formally charged.

The artworks are estimated to be worth around £80 million. They spent 40 years in the Le Guennec's garage

Mr Le Guennec has continued to insist that the artworks were gifts from his former employer in gratitude for his electrical work.

He has now told Le Parisien newspaper ahead of his trial: 'I worked for Monsieur and Madame Picassso from 1970 to 1973.

'One day Jacqueline called me and said "Here, this is for you".

'I looked and saw it was sketches, drafts and other pieces from his studio. There were 271 of them, which I put in my garage.

'It was not until 2010 when I had a prostate operation that I decided to do something with them.

'I wrote to the Picasso Foundation and they asked me to bring them to Paris.

'Then we were accused of stealing them. But in fact they were a gift.

'We could have sold them at any time, but didn't because they had a sentimental value.'

Mrs Le Guennec added: 'We are sure these artworks are our property and we are confident that our lawyers will prove that.'

After the couple were charged Christine Pinault, spokeswoman for Picasso's son Claude, told of the 'astonishment' at the Picasso Foundation when Mr Le Guennec arrived with the haul of artworks in a suitcase.

She said: 'He made an appointment to come and see us and arrived on September 9 with an unlocked suitcase full of paintings and sketches.

'We could hardly believe he had simply got on a train with something so valuable.

'He first claimed it was Picasso himself that had given them to him, but he didn't seem to be able to describe a single occasion when a painting was handed to him.

'When we asked him why he thought Picasso had been so generous, he told us simply that the artist must have thought he deserved them for all his hard work.'

Picasso's son Claude and five other relatives of the Spanish-born artist have dismissed Mr Le Guennec's claim that he could have received the paintings as gifts.

Claude Picasso has insisted his father would 'never' have given such a large quantity of works to anyone.

He told French daily Liberation: 'That doesn't stand up. These works were part of his life.'

Picasso family lawyer Jean-Jacques Neuer added: 'Claude Picasso was astounded. He couldn't believe his eyes.

'Just about everybody has felt that way. When you have 271 Picasso works that were never seen, never inventoried, that's just unprecedented.

The Le Guennecs are due to go on trial in Grasse, southern France, over the artworks, on February 10. Tney are charged with receiving stolen goods

'The most important thing is re-discovering important artworks for the good of art history as a whole.'

A spokesman for France's Central Office for the Fight against Traffic in Cultural Goods, part of the Interior Ministry, said the paintings were seized in 2010 and are being held in a secure location.

The seized Picassos include a watercolour from his Blue Period, and nine cubist works which experts believe are worth £33 million alone.

Also in the collection are portraits of his first wife Olga, as well as a number of gouaches and lithographs.

The Le Guennecs are due to go on trial in Grasse, southern France, on February 10 charged with receiving stolen goods.

Picasso, who lived from 1881 to 1973, is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential artists of the 20th century. 

He is the world's most stolen artist due to his prolific output and the value of his works. 

Picasso produced more than 20,000 works of art during his long career, but hundreds have been listed as missing, either because they were stolen or given away. 

The Art Loss Register lists 550 missing Picassos.
