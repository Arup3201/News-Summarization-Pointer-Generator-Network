You don't want to mess with Sharon Standifird.

Fed up with her son's failure to pick up the phone when she calls and his ability to never answer her texts, the discerning Houston mom decided, with the ways of modern technology, surely she could do something about it.

'I literally just started researching how to develop an app,' Standifird told CBS.

Once she started, Standifird didn't stop, and after a few months of designing the application and then meeting with a developer, the result was Ignore No More.

Dedicated: Sharon Standifird decided she wanted to create an app that would allow her to shut down her son's phone if he didn't answer her calls

Up and running: After a few months of development, the app, called Ignore No More, is now up and running

Mom on a mission: Sharon Standifird served in the Gulf War

The app allows Standifird to deactivate the phone belonging to her son, Bradley, after installing it onto his iPhone.

Bradley requires a password to reactive the phone, which only his mom has.

He cannot call or text anyone but his mom when Ignore No More is activated.

The phone will let him dial 911, but it won't let his access internet or games.

'Bradley needs to call me because I'm the person that has the unlock password,' Standifird said.

Her husband William said he is not surprised at the capabilities of his wife, who served in the Gulf War.

'Pretty much anything she sets her mind to she does,' he said.

Standifird said the app had made an immediate difference in being able to contact her son.

Clever: The app gives parents the power to shut down their children's phones, alloweing them to only call their mom or dad or 911

Deactivated: This is the screen the child will see when their phone is shut down via Ignore No More

Not happy: Bradley Standifird said that while he thinks his mom came up with a great idea, he wish she didn't have such control over his phone

To ensure his phone is not shut off, Bradley has been responding to every text and answering his mother's girls.

'I thought it was a good idea, but for other people, not me,' Bradley told CBS.

Ignore No More is available only for Android phones via Google Play.
