It seems veteran Fox News reporter Geraldo Rivera follows the maxim 'If at first you don't succeed, try, try again,' particularly when it comes to dealing with Occupy Wall Street protesters. On Sunday evening, Mr Rivera waded into a crowd of protesters along with his camera crew and some body guards, flashing his trademark grin. He even went so far as to high-five some supporters.Â

The attack: Viewers can see the man in the centre witha yellow and blue hat pouring a package of unidentified white powder on Mr Rivera's head

It seemed like a much warmer welcome than he was given on his first trip down to the Zuccoti Park protest, when he was heckled and appeared to leave due the area as a result.

Not missing a beat, Mr Rivera wiped off the powder, brushed back his hair, and turned the incident around.

Shake it off: Mr Rivera immediately brushes the substance off his head

'You have a point, you have momentum,' he said to the crowd. 'Don't let the jerks steal your momentum.'The powder incident didn't leave Mr Rivera as flustered as his previous trip to the protest. When he went to report on Occupy Wall Street last Wednesday, he was immediately met with chants saying 'Fox News lies!' and ushering him away from the crowds. Though video footage certainly makes it seem like he was shying away from the angry crowd, Mr Rivera posted otherwise on his blog.

First time around: Rivera was trying to talk to protesters when crowds recognised him and started chanting 'Na na na na, hey hey hey, Goodbye!'

'Their chants did not send us packing,' the blog said. 'In fact, through the crowd's chanting, we completed the remaining two topics and five interviews. Then, 12 minutes later, having covered all the topics planned and interviewed all the guests invited on the program, coming back on camera from an edited piece on the similarities between Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox, Geraldo delivered (a) wrap to close the show.'This is not the first skirmish the Mr Rivera has dealt with in his years on the job. He joined Fox almost 10 years ago and has also covered the Afghanistan war, Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iraqi elections in Baghdad.Most notably, before working at Fox, he ran his own talk show, and during a 1988 programme called 'Teen Hatemongers,' he was punched in the face by an interview subject who broke Mr Rivera's nose.
