A grieving woman who overate following her mother's death told of how after dropping FIVE dress sizes in just one year her breasts shrunk from a 38E to a 34B – so she used her mother's inheritance to get implants.

Emma Thair-White, 43, was prompted to lose weight after she gorged so much that whole pieces of food rose back up into her throat when she bent over to tie her shoelaces.

The mother-of-two, who said she over-ate while grieving following her mother's death, was hugely successful and went from a 15-stone, size 22 to a ten-stone, size 12.

Emma Thair-White piled on the pounds after the tragic loss of her mother, however, the 43-year-old has now dropped five dress sizes and had a boob job to lift and enlarge her sagging chest

But her breasts also took the hit – and shrunk from a 38E to a 34B.

'I didn't want to look in the mirror – I didn't like what it the weight loss had left,' she said, adding she was disgusted with her 'saggy' breasts.

'Every bra I put on, the skin just sat in there. I'd never lost my boobs throughout any diet, so it was a shock.'

In 2014, she decided to use part of her mum's inheritance to get a breast uplift and 34F implants.

Mrs Thair-White, from Grays, Essex, said: 'I wasn't sure about spending part of the inheritance on the operation but my husband Shane encouraged me,' she said.

'He said: 'You've always put the kids first, now it's time for you.'

Mrs Thair-White told how she struggled to shift the pounds she had gained while pregnant with her children Eva, 16 and Max, 10, but her binge eating spiraled out of control after she lost her beloved mother Ethel to brain cancer in 2009.

Emma, pictured here with her two children Eva (left) and Max (right) decided to lose the weight in 2013 after she became so big that she couldn't tie her shoelaces without food coming up into her mouth

She was so devastated by the loss that she secretly turned to drink to ease the pain. 'It started off that I had a bottle of wine to toast [my mum], and things seemed a little bit rosier and it wasn't so painful,' she said.

'That one glass in the evening turned to two, then three, then four and then before I knew it I'd be ordering three bottles of wine in the shopping then, unbeknown to my husband, going and buying another three.

'I used to make sure if there was a lot of bottles in the recycling bin I'd put the rubbish straight in after. He didn't have a clue.'

In 2010, she broke down and confessed all to her GP, who prescribed her a course of anti-depressants.

'One day I just woke up and decided I wasn't going to do it anymore and I needed help,' she said. She cut out drinking straight away.

Emma was suffering from depression when she decided to give up drinking, however, she then turned to take-aways eating them two or three times a week 

Emma is now happy to show off her slimmer figure in a variety of outfits, including this fancy dress costime 

However, Mrs Thair-White was still battling with her weight – a fight she believes was made harder by her anti-depressants.

'The takeaways went from weekends to two or three times a week,' she said. It wasn't a few scoops of Ben and Jerry's, I'd have the tub.

'With my appetite, there is no off button. It is all down to my self control.' Classmates at son her Max's school even made cruel comments about him having a 'fat mum.'

The final push she needed to kick-start her weight loss came in December 2013. She had been stocking the house with sweets and chocolate in the run-up to Christmas, but could not resist binging on the treats.

'I stacked up my cupboards and I used to sit and eat every night until I felt sick,' she said, 'We were going somewhere and I bent down to tie my shoes then all my food came back into my mouth because my tummy was so big.

'I just remember saying to my husband: 'I can't do this anymore.'

Emma used some of the inheritance money left by her mother to pay for a boob job after her chest was left sagging following her weight loss regime 

Emma's two children and husband encouraged her in her weight loss, they joined their mother on her healthy eating regime, promising her they would lose weight as a family

Her 42-year-old husband and two children also joined in with her new healthy regime, promising they would lose weight as a family.

Mrs Thair-White threw herself into exercise, taking the family's dog Morris with her on speed walks.

Progress was slow at first. When she had only managed to shed a stone after several months, she turned to Forza Raspberry K2 diet supplements.

'At the beginning when I wasn't on [the supplements], it was very slow,' she said, 'But after I started, it came off in leaps and bounds.

'The shape change spurred me on. I had a waist – it was a good feeling. The biggest thing is excuses.

'I've had so many people approach me and say they want to do it but there's all these 'buts', and I'll say to them that they're not ready.

'You've got to be in the frame of mind to do it. I've proved that you don't have to run – I speed walk.

'Even just walking helps, it's just making yourself active. I just want people to know there is always light at the end of any tunnel no matter how big or small, and looking after yourself really does make all the difference. Don't give up. It can be done.'
