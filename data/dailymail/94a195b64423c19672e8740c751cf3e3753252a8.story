Alan Irvine has admitted his position in charge at West Bromwich Albion is uncertain after a sixth defeat in eight games left his side two points off the relegation places.

Chairman Jeremy Peace sacked Steve Clarke this time last year after a poor run of results and Irvine has been under near constant pressure from fans since his appointment in the summer.

West Brom were fortunate to emerge from their Boxing Day encounter with Manchester City with a 3-1 defeat and Irvine is aware his job is under scrutiny.

‘The chairman will make a decision as far as that’s concerned, and I can’t control it,’ conceded Irvine. ‘Can I be confident? Not necessarily. Because I don’t know what the thinking is.

‘All I can do is work as hard as I do and try to get the right kind of performances and results. I work extremely hard and leave nothing to chance.’
