A dog-owner was hit with £75 litter fine for littering after brushing his German shepherd in a park.

Roy Wyre was handed the fine by a council official as he brushed two-year-old Spencer on Harvey Hadden Playing Fields in Nottingham.

The 66-year-old had been sitting with his pet on a blanket, brushing the dog's hair, when he was approached by a council community protection officer.

Barking mad: Roy Wyre was fined £75 for littering as he brushed his dog Spencer in the park

The retired security guard was wearing a high-visibility jacket when he was approached by the official, who accused him impersonating a police officer.

Roy, from Bilborough, Nottingham, said: 'I had been walking the dog and we'd sat down for a bit of a rest and I was giving him a brush.

'This man walked over and told me to take my hi-vis jacket off because it looked like I was impersonating a police officer.

'He asked me for my details and I said that I had done nothing wrong and I was not giving him my name and address.

'Then he called for a police officer, who also told me to take my jacket off, and asked for my name and address before leaving.

Red faced: Nottingham City Council has backed down and retracted the fine

'As soon as he had gone, the community protection officer came back with a fine slip with a £75 charge on it.

'He put on the slip "litter, large amounts", but there was nowhere near large amounts at all.

'You could brush Spencer all day and there wouldn't be more than a handful of hair.

'If there is a little bit of hair coming off, one of the birds will pick it up for a nest. It's not like dropping paper or something.'

But after Roy complained to the council, officials were forced to drop the fine issued last Wednesday.

A community protection spokesman at Nottingham City Council said: 'A CPO on routine patrol on Harvey Hadden playing fields was concerned after coming across what was believed to be a member of the public wearing a police uniform.

'After checking with a police colleague, this turned out not to be the case.

'The gentleman in question was also fined for littering, but once the full circumstances became clear a decision was made to overturn this and an apology was issued.'
