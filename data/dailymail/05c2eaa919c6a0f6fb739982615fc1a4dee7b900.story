Six months ago Andros Townsend would have been dreaming of a World Cup with England this summer. But on Thursday night, the Tottenham midfielder watched the darts at the O2 Arena.

The winger was crucial in Roy Hodgson's qualification for Brazil, and was spotted at the Premier League event.

He may have been checking up on his girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan, who is a walk-on girl at many Premier League outings.

O'Sullivan was in the Big Brother house in 2013, and has since been a model.

Townsend will have been hoping to be in Portugal preparing for the World Cup, but had to undergo ankle surgery.

The winger has had a fragmented campaign at White Hart Lane, making 25 appearances.

Raymond van Barneveld won the Premier League darts title after a 10-6 victory over Michael van Gerwen.
