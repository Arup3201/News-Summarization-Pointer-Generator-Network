They're famous for glamour, lashings of bronzer and of course, some of the most expensive knickers on the planet.

But when Vogue came calling, the Victoria's Secret Angels agreed to an entirely different look - fresh-faced and with no underwear on at all.

The striking new photos, which appear in the magazine's November issue, feature star models Adriana Lima, Candice Swanepoel, Lais Ribeiro and Elsa Hosk.

Dressed in dramatic full-length candy-striped skirts and nothing on top, the stunning Patrick Demarchielier photo is a world away from the bling looks that characterise Victoria's Secret's output.

But the bling won't be gone for long, with the brand due to host its first ever London fashion extravaganza on the 9th December.

While Justin Bieber, who famously appeared on the catwalk in 2012, and last year's musical model Rihanna, are unlikely to appear, big name singers and bigger name guests are expected to attend.

The Victoria's Secret catwalk show has been one of the most glamorous events on the fashion calendar since 1995, when it made its debut in New York.

Compèred by model and actress Stephanie Seymour, it featured supermodels Frederique van der Wal and Beverly Peele - the first Victoria's Secret Angels.

Since then, the brand - and the show - has gone from strength to strength, although neither have been entirely without controversy.

In 2005, the show, which had previously been broadcast live, was cancelled following the infamous 'nipplegate' incident at the 2004 Super Bowl Final.

More problematic were the accusations of insensitivity that followed the 2012 show, when model Karlie Kloss appeared on the runway in an a Native American inspired ensemble.

Deemed simplistic and stereotypical by Native Americans, its appearance on the catwalk was swiftly followed by an apology from the brand.
