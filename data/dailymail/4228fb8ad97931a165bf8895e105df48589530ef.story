Dusan Tadic scored the only goal of the game as Southampton beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.

The result means Ronald Koeman's side leapfrog Louis van Gaal's in the Premier League as the Saints move up to third in the table. 

Robin van Persie was involved in a tetchy exchange with Phil Dowd over a drop-ball restart midway through the first half and responded by shoving the ball rather angrily into the referee’s midriff. Fortunately for the Dutchman, Dowd has a little extra padding in that department and no harm was done. However, the official had little hesitation in booking Van Persie for a challenge on Jose Fonte just before the hour mark.

Southampton gave a debut to Eljero Elia and the 27-year-old Holland winger on loan from Werder Bremen was given a brutal introduction to English football by Chris Smalling who left him in a heap with one lunging challenge in the first half after overrunning the ball close to his own penalty box.

This was Southampton’s first victory in the league at Old Trafford in 27 years – a 2-0 win here in January 1988. United had won 16 times since then, drawing three more games, but this was their first defeat.

Southampton hero Dusan Tadic was caught off guard when Ronaldo Koeman tried to summon the Saints substitute off the bench after an hour.

The Serbian midfielder wasn’t wearing a shirt so one of the backroom staff had to sprint back to the dressing-room for his No 11 jersey. Then it turned out that he hadn’t got his shinpads either. Tadic’s shirt didn’t stay on for long, however, as he tore it off in celebration after scoring six minutes later and was duly booked by Phil Dowd. 

Manchester United failed to name a single player youth-team product in their line-up for only the third time since 1937. One of those occasions was in the win over Hull in November, but at least Louis van Gaal had four players who have come through the Old Trafford academy on the bench yesterday – Jonny Evans, Paddy McNair, Tyler Blackett and James Wilson.
