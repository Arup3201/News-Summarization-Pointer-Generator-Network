Normally it is defenders who like to put in the first tackle on a striker to make their point. With Diego Costa it is the other way around.

He is bristling for a fight and almost wants defenders to make him angry because when he is fired up he is an even better player.

To deal with Costa you have to show you have more than him in every department. You have to be stronger, quicker and must anticipate better than him.

Diego Costa could now face a three-game ban after being charged by the FA for his stamp on Can

Costa and Liverpool's Martin Skrtel square up after the other stamp incident during Tuesday night's clash

You have to do your work early and try to get in ahead of him. That can be a gamble because if he gets away, there is no catching Costa.

There is no question you have to match his physicality, even if it means risking being booked or sent off. He wants to rumble and you have to stand up to that.

But he is more than just a brute. He links intelligently, has great skill and has all the potential to be as good as, if not better than, Didier Drogba.
