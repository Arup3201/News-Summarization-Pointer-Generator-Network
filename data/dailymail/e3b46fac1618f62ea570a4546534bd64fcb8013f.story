Underground radio stations have a rich history in the UK - but this device gives the term a whole new meaning.

A designer has created a fully functioning radio, which has the entire London tube map built in as its circuit.

The impressive 45cm by 45cm contraption is accurately labeled with each of the 270 stations and took three months to make.

The underground map as you've never seen it before: A designers created a working radio using the iconic London Underground map as circuits.

Little touches talented artist Japanese designer Yuri Suzuki has added included choosing BBC's White City for the tuner and Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner for volume control.

Oxford Circus has been changed to Oxford Circuit while Kensington has also been renamed Kensington (Resistor).

Yuri, who has lived in London since 2006, said he was inspired by Harry Beck's iconic tube map design.

Yuri, 31, said: 'I was asked to create something for the London Design Museum that showed how electricity worked.

'The tube map is designed by Harry Beck, who used to be an electrics engineer, and he got inspiration due to an electronic circuit board as well so it's a really nice connection.

'You can follow a tube map the same way you follow electronics.

The device functions as an FM/AM radio, with the volume knob, fittingly, at Speakers Corner, the tuner control at 'BBC White City' and the option to switch frequencies at London Bridge. The battery is at Battersea Power Station.

'I've lived in London for six years and love the mixture of music and culture so it was the perfect tribute to the city.'

It is not the only musical project he has developed recently.

He also created The Sound Taxi, which is a black cab that turns London street noise into real time music as it travels around the capital's streets.

Fitted with special speakers and microphones to pick up the London buzz, software transforms it into live music.

Yuri's 'London Underground Circuit Maps' project is part of the designers in residence programme at the London Design Museum, which is on show until January next year.

London-based designer Yuri Suzuki says his 'Tube Map Radio' is inspired by a spoof diagram created by the original designer of the London Tube map, Harry Beck, which shows the lines and stations as an annotated electrical circuit.
