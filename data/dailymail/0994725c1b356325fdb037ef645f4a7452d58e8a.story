Teeth found in a fire believed to have been set by a cannibal to cook his victim match those of a missing German adventurer.

German media today reported that investigators are now certain renegade South Sea guide and hunter Henri Haiti killed, dismembered and ate Stefan Ramin on a round-the-world trip with his partner.

Bild, Germany's biggest newspaper, said: 'It is the suspicion of the authorities that the hunter carved his victim up, ate parts of the body and burned the remainder along with animals cadavers.

'He is regarded as a cannibal.'

Jose Thorel, prosecutor on the island near Tahiti were the gruesome discovery was made, said: 'It is almost certain the remains we found in the fire are those of Stefan Ramin.'

It is understood that, despite DNA testing that will take weeks to complete, a dental file sent from Germany to the island of Papeete where the charred bones were sent for analysis shows the remains to be positively identified as his.

The hunt has intensified on the paradise island of Nuku Hiva for Haiti, 31, whose knowledge of the bushland where authorities say he led his victim is unparalleled, giving him a huge advantage over his pursuers.

Further examination of the site where Mr Ramin's remains were discovered showed how fierce the fire was that consumed him.

Leaves 25ft up show evidence of scorch marks and ash, clothes, teeth and bone fragments were found over a 35 foot radius.

On Monday it was confirmed the BKA, Germany's equivalent of the FBI, is now involved with French authorities in the hunt for Mr Ramin's killer.

The 40-year-old from the small town of Haselau in north-west Germany was on a round-the-world trip with girlfriend Heike Dorsch, 37, when they anchored off the coast of the Polynesian island on September 16.

He went off on a goat hunt with Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - and never returned.

Police say Haiti went back to the boat to try to lure Miss Dorsch into the jungle claiming he had had an accident. She was suspicious and refused to go with him.

He ended up sexually assaulting her and tying her to a tree.

It was only on Wednesday last week that the human remains were found. Among the embers were bones including a jaw bone, teeth and melted metal - believed to be fillings.

Mr Ramin, a fanatical sailor, was a former business adviser. He kept a regular blog of his trip begun in 2008 and one of his last entries read: 'I seek freedom and adventures'.

A family friend said: 'It is a tragedy that a man with such a zest for life should have his days ended in such a brutal fashion.'

He bought his catamaran Baju in Turkey and had planned to spend the next two years island hopping in the South Pacific.

On Facebook, he listed his interests as 'travelling, blue water sailing, kiting, kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing, diving... actually everything which one can do on and under the water'.

Last month, they dropped anchor in Nuku Hiva, largest of the Marquesas islands, which over the centuries have featured in many reports of cannibalism.

Deborah Kimitete, deputy mayor of Nuku Hiva, told local news website Les Nouvelles: 'No one can believe what has happened. This has never happened here before, this is the first time, it's horrible.'

It was not clear whether Miss Dorsch is still on the island or whether she has returned home to Germany.

Nuku Hiva has a population of just over 2,000 and featured in the stories of Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick.

Outside of horror films, cannibalism is virtually unheard of in the modern world. The Korowai of Papua New Guinea are one of the last surviving tribes to eat humans as a cultural practice.

Numbering about 3,000, they live in an area so remote they were unaware of the existence of anyone besides themselves until 1970.

Although the claims have not been verified, the Korowai reportedly eat the brain immediately, while it is still warm.
