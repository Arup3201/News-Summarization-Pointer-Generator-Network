When it comes to seduction, French women believe they have it down to a fine art.

And now they are set to share the secret of their success as Soft Paris, France's answer to Ann Summers, launches in the UK.   

The firm, which organises home parties selling lingerie, boudoir accessories and sex toys, say their ethos is to encourage women to explore their sexuality and teach them secrets to rekindle their relationships. 

Here, in a MailOnline exclusive, Soft Paris reveal ten tips to allow British women to bring sexy French flair to the bedroom...

Ooh la la! Opt for stockings or suspenders and let him watch you put them on (and off)

Why do English women hunch over, either shuffling or stomping? This is not seductive. Take the time to look around you, proudly, chin up/shoulders back, walking with one foot almost in front of the other, to undulate your hips provocatively.

Don't be a slobbery, noisy, bounding English bulldog. Imagine you’re an elegant cat - light, agile, graceful, quiet. Seduction is about understanding the effects of your movements and using them to your advantage.

Racy tips: Wear black lace and act feline to seduce your man

Elegance: Walk tall and let a man put your coat on

When a gentleman holds your coat out for you, do not take it from him, let him dress you. Allow doors to be held open and seats pulled out.

Be elegant, always. Don’t hold your glass of wine as if it's a pint of beer, French women lightly hold the top of the glass stem. Know how to handle all objects well.

Instead opt for stockings and suspenders, but make sure he is watching when you put them on - give him a show. Slip them on slowly with long strokes and finish off by snapping the elastic on the top of your thighs.

Although we could reach the zip on the back of our dresses if we really wanted to, allow him the privilege instead. It can be as seductive to dress a woman, as it is to undress her.

Get rid of the Bridget Jones knickers and replace with black lace, ribbon trims, suspenders and waist cinching corsets. Your face should reveal what you’re wearing beneath your clothes, creating a subtle smile, the only clue to your your saucy secret. 

Forget the fleece pyjamas and bed socks. Opt for a sheer babydoll and a satin robe. It won’t stay on for long…

Wear scented and edible crème so your entire body is lickable. He’ll want to make you dessert.

Bedroom fireworks: Soft Paris recommend being playful, adventurous and uninhibited

Even though he may be your husband, never stop seducing. At a dinner party, under the table, take his hand and slowly stroke it along your thigh, leading up to your suspenders. Send naughty texts while he is at work. Intimacy doesn’t have to stay at home…

Be playful, adventurous and uninhibited. Start by exploring and learning your own body, before moving on to your loved one. Intimate toys can create bedroom fireworks.
