When this cross-eyed cat was abandoned by his owners on the side of the road as a kitten his chances of survival looked slim.

But Jarvis P. Weasley, whose eyes look inward, is now enjoying a new lease of life after an animal lover rescued him and nursed him back to health.

The five-year-old is named after glasses-wearing Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker and fictional Harry Potter character Ron Weasley who is ginger.

Jarvis P. Weasley was found when he was four weeks-old by an animal centre in California, and subsequently fostered by cat-mad Daria Kelly.

His arrival in Ms Kelly's house was only meant to be temporary, but the cross-eyed kitty has now become a permanent member of the family.

She said: 'I just remember him standing out because, though he was very sick, he always seemed so happy, and his face never fails to make me smile.

'One day I was watching him jump for joy in his cage, seemingly over nothing. I took it to be pure happiness.

'I waited until the sick kittens that I was fostering at my home were well, and then I took him to foster - but he ended up staying permanently.'

At the time Jarvis was rescued by Oakland Animal Services in California, Ms Kelly was volunteering alongside Amber Holly, one of the veterinary technicians.

Remembering the day he came into their lives, Amber said: 'Jarvis came in a cross-eyed, snot-nosed, squinty yet adorable mess, but sadly kittens with an upper respiratory at a government shelter do not last long.

Strabismus is a term used to describe the abnormal positioning or direction of the eyeball.

Normally, the eyeball is held in place and moves from side to side and top to bottom under the influence of small muscles which attach directly to the eyeball.

Occasionally one muscle may be longer or stronger than the muscle located on the opposite side.

This causes the eyeball to veer off in an abnormal direction. One or both eyes may be affected. If both eyes deviate towards the nose, the pet is referred to as cross-eyed.

This is common in Siamese cats and is called medial or convergent strabismus.

The eyeballs may deviate away from the nose, just the opposite of being cross-eyed, and this is called divergent strabismus.

'Daria was a volunteer at the time and she agreed to foster him for Saving Grace Rescue while he was treated so that he wouldn't be euthanised at the shelter.

'He captured Daria's heart and was permanently signed over to her after being neutered.'

Despite his tempestuous early years, Jarvis doesn't appear to hold any grudges.

'He is so happy-go-lucky!  He has always had a zest for life, even when he was tiny and sick. He's cuddly, playful, mischievous and very friendly,' said Daria.

'I often use him for introductions to new fosters because he is so personable and non-threatening.'

After spending over 30 years working in the music industry it was inevitable that Ms Kelly would name one of her pets after a rock star.

However, after fostering almost 200 cats, a few dozen dogs and one tarantula in the last 12 years, the time has now come for her to change careers and study to become a veterinary nurse herself.

Ms Kelly, who believes this new job has always been her destiny, said: 'In my youth I was always going to be a vet, but life happened and I took a detour.

'I'm just a tad more rock and roll now and the cats have an extensive record collection to peruse!'
