It's the emotionless face of a father being shamed in front of his daughters for a despicable act.

Steven C. DeMocker, 59, who was acused of horrifically bludgeoning his ex-wife to death in order to escape alimony payments and claim her $750,000 life insurance policy, has been found guilty of murder.

His two daughters, Katie and Charlotte, broke down in tears as the verdict was read out in Yavapai County Courthouse in Prescott, Arizona, following a two and a half day deliberation by the jury.

Virginia Carol Kennedy, an artist who was described as 'adventurous, radiant, wise, humble and accomplished', was killed at her home on the night of July 2, 2008.

She had been beaten so hard her skull had shattered.

Guilty: Steven DeMocker looks back at his daughters in the gallery after being convicted of first-degree murder in the bludgeoning death of his ex-wife

Steven DeMocker's daughter Katie wipes away tears as her father is convicted of the first degree murder of her mother, Virginia Carol Kennedy, in 2008.

The prosecution claimed DeMocker - a former high-flying stockbroker who was left debt-ridden by the financial crash - used a golf club, specifically a 7-wood Big Bertha made by Calloway, according to The Daily Courier.

While the weapon was never found, investigators recovered the club's head cover.

A detailed account of what drove DeMocker to kill Kennedy was heard by the court over the course of the trial, which started in July.

DeMocker was a financial advisor at UBS Financial Services who worked solely on commission.

At the height of his career he was earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.

But according to several experts who testified at the trial, DeMocker spent more than he made and had incurred a huge debt.

When the economy crashed, DeMocker's take-home was slashed.

One month he was paid nothing.

His marriage to Kennedy fell apart in the process and, according to an email exchange following their separation, DeMocker was borrowing $20,000 a month from his father to pay his bills.

Some of these bills were alimony payments to Kennedy, which were $6000-a-month.

DeMocker soon decided he would kill Kennedy, the prosecution said.

Viriginia Carol Kennedy was beaten so badly her skull was shattered. Her ex-husband Steven DeMocker has been found guilty of her murder five years after her death. DeMocker's motive was her life insurance policy. She was described by friends as 'adventurous' and 'humble'

Prosecutors argued the case without having a confession, eyewitnesses or direct evidence tying DeMocker to the crime.

The defense  countered that authorities didn't properly investigate Kennedy's death and tried to direct attention to a man who lived with her at the time but who has since died.

DeMocker was found guilty of first-degree murder and six other counts: first-degree burglary, three counts of fraudulent schemes and artifices, evidence tampering, and a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

The non-murder charges against DeMocker stemmed from allegations that he arranged to have an anonymous email sent to lawyers claiming drug gang members killed Kennedy.

DeMocker also had floated a story about a voice in the vent at the Camp Verde jail after his arrest that said his ex-wife was 'killed by two guys from Phoenix'.

Investigators concluded DeMocker concocted the account.

DeMocker is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 13.

The prosecution have not pushed for the death penalty.

He could receive either life in prison or life in prison with a chance of release after 25 years on the murder charge, plus additional time  over the convictions for burglary, conspiracy, tampering with evidence, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and two counts of fraud.
