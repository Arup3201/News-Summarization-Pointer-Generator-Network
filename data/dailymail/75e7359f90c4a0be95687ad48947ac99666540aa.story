Rachel Pepe has been told by Thorne Middle School in New Jersey that she will only be allowed back to school if she dresses as a boy and accepts being called Brian, the name on her birth certificate

A 13-year-old transgender middle school girl from New Jersey claims her school is refusing to allow her back for the new academic year unless she returns as a boy.

Rachel Pepe transitioned to a girl over the summer, but Thorne Middle School in Middletown has said that they want her to return as a teenage boy and that they will address her as Brian, the name on her birth certificate.

Thorne Middle School is also demanding that Pepe dress as a boy and claims it doesn't have the resources to provide bathroom facilities for her.

Angela Peters, Rachel’s mother, told The Asbury Park Press;
 'he was going to school last year as Brian,' adding that the 
transgender teen 'developed stress-related seizures, depression and 
panic attacks'.

'How can I send her back as Rachel? And I am not sending her back as Brian because the depression will start again.

Indeed,
 her mother said that Pepe was desperately depressed and bullied by 
other children and when she returned home before announcing she was a 
girl, would come home and cry for hours.

'I sort of felt something was missing, that something was wrong,' said Pepe to The Asbury Park Press.

'This is just recently I realized I wanted to be a girl,' she said.

According to Peters the school was not being accommodating to Rachel at any point.

An official allegedly told Peters that the school was not able to handle a transgendered child.

'Peters said she was told school officials couldn’t call her Rachel because her birth certificate says Brian. But Peters pointed out the school allows for nicknames to be used,' Peters told The Asbury Park Press.

Middletown Schools Superintendent William George said that the school will try and work with Pepe to help her.

'We as a district want to do everything we can as a district,' George said. 'Every child is different and their education and social and emotional well being is my priority. We will work with them to find the appropriate placement.'

'I support this without interviewing this child. It certainly is reasonable. Children with psycho-sexual issues often benefit from a fresh start at a new school,' he said.
