From the outside, it looks like just an ordinary van. But hidden within are a list of mod cons and luxury appliances that would make even the most houseproud jealous.

A luxury car customising company has unveiled its latest creation - a van which has been turned into a five-star hotel-style suite.

Lexani Motorcars has created the Reale which is an armoured Mercedes-Benz B6 Sprinter.

The luxurious, one-of-a-kind Reale looks unassuming from the outside and could pass as an ordinary van.

But the interior design features only 
the finest bespoke accoutrements rivalling those found in high-end 
yachts and private jets.

Since
 its launch in 2010, Lexani has provided custom vehicles for 
professional athletes, Hollywood stars and government officials around 
the world.

A spokesman said:
 'Each coach is meticulously crafted using only the highest quality 
materials, furnishing, and carpentry, with incomparable attention to 
detail.'
