Popular diets such as Atkins or Weight Watchers can help people lose weight quickly but in the long term may be no more effective than living healthily, a study claims.

People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, the researchers say.

The advice comes amid an obesity crisis, with one adult in every four in England obese and three in 10 children between two and 15 overweight or obese.

Fat fighter: People on fad diets often lose weight in the short term, but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques, researchers say

The researchers analysed clinical trials on four popular weight-loss diet plans: the low-carbohydrate Atkins diet; the South Beach diet, which distinguishes 'good' and 'bad' carbs and fats; the Weight Watchers calorie-counting diet; and the Zone diet, which stipulates a 3:4 ratio of protein to carbohydrates.

They compared them with what they dubbed 'usual care', which refers to traditional methods to promote weight loss such as low-fat diets, behavioural weight loss intervention, nutritional counselling, or self-help materials.

In trials comparing Weight Watchers to usual care, Weight Watchers dieters lost an average 7.7 to 13.2 pounds after a year compared to 1.8 to 11.9 pounds with usual care.

However, after two years the weight lost was partially regained.

In the only trial comparing the South Beach diet to usual care, no difference in weight loss occurred in 12 months, however the participants in this study were both severely obese and had undergone gastric bypass surgery.

There are millions of people in Britain who aren't getting sufficient calories, protein, vitamins and minerals.

Doctors say our growing reliance on fast food, coupled with soaring rates of binge-drinking, means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health.

The result, in the most extreme cases, is pot-bellies, wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world.

While malnutrition can be fatal, in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life, from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy.

Results from trials on the Atkins diet were inconsistent.

Trials involving head-to-head comparisons between Atkins, Weight Watchers, Zone and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year, as did those in the control group who received the usual care.

Those on the Atkins diet lost an average 4.6 to 10.3lbs; Weight Watchers participants lost an average 6.6lbs; Zone dieters lost an average 3.5 to 7lbs; and control lost about 4.85lbs.

In studies involving head-to-head comparisons, there were no marked differences between Atkins, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets at improving cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, or other cardiovascular risk factors.

The longest diet studies researchers analysed lasted for two years, and results were only available for the Atkins or Weight Watchers diets. Those studies found dieters regained some of their weight over time.

Senior author Dr Mark Eisenberg, Professor of Medicine at Jewish General Hospital/McGill University in Canada, said: 'Despite their popularity and important contributions to the multi-million dollar weight loss industry, we still do not know if these diets are effective to help people lose weight and decrease their risk factors for heart disease.

'With such a small number of trials looking at each diet and their somewhat conflicting results, there is only modest evidence that using these diets is beneficial in the long-term.'

Dr Eisenberg said to better understand the potential benefits from any one or all of these diets, researchers need to conduct large clinical trials directly comparing all four popular diets for long-term weight loss and changes in other heart disease risk factors.

He added: 'A broader lifestyle intervention, which also involves doctors and other health professionals, may be more effective.

'This also tells doctors that popular diets on their own may not be the solution to help their patients lose weight.'

The findings were published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.
