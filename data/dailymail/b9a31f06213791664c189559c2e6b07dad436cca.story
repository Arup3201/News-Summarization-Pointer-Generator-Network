Helen Grant failed to name the FA Cup winners (Wigan), the England rugby captain (Chris Robshaw) and the winner of Wimbledon's women's tournament (Marion Bartoli)

Sports Minister Helen Grant was left humiliated after she failed to get a single question right in a basic quiz – on sport.

The Conservative MP did not know the name of the current Wimbledon women’s champion.

She also scored an own-goal by not knowing who won this year’s FA Cup.

Mrs Grant bungled her way through five questions and got every answer wrong, even when she tried to cheat by seeking help from an adviser.

She was quizzed in a toe-curling exchange with ITV Meridian. Asked who won the women’s title at Wimbledon, she replied: ‘It’s not one of us.

‘I know Andy Murray did it for us, which is absolutely fantastic and that’s the important thing.’ The correct answer was Marion Bartoli of France.

Next she was asked who the FA Cup holders were. A slightly anxious-looking Mrs Grant said: ‘Come on, help,’ before replying: ‘Manchester United because it’s my favourite club.’

Most football fans would know if their team had won such a coveted trophy. The correct answer was Wigan Athletic.

Mrs Grant did not even attempt to name the England Rugby Union captain (Chris Robshaw) simply replying: ‘What about hockey?’

Perhaps
taking pity on her, the presenter asked her when the football team in 
her constituency, Maidstone United, had left the football league.

Mrs Grant conceded: ‘These are hard questions’ before adding ‘last year’. The correct answer was 1992.

Finally, she was asked which Paralympian had won the most gold medals at London 2012.

An
adviser whispered the answer which Mrs Grant parroted: David Weir. But 
the correct answer was Australian swimmer Jacqueline Freney.

Afterwards
Mrs Grant said: ‘I wasn’t told there was going to be a quiz thrown in 
at the end of an interview. If I’d known I would have done some proper 
revision.

‘My sports pub quiz knowledge may not 
be encyclopaedic but I completely understand the positive impact that 
participating in sport has on people’s lives.’

Last
month, the MP for Maidstone and The Weald said that sport was in her 
DNA shortly after being promoted to Sports Minister. She had widely been
tipped for the sack in the reshuffle.

During her youth, according to her Parliamentary website, she was captain of her school tennis and hockey teams and represented Cumbria at hockey, tennis, athletics, and cross country. She later became under-16 judo champion in the north of England and southern Scotland.

Mrs Grant is not the only sports minister to be left floundering after being ambushed in a quiz.

Labour’s Richard Caborn suffered a similar fate in 2001, when the BBC’s Clare Balding asked him a string of questions about sport.

Mr Caborn did not know that Martin Johnson was the then captain of the British Lions rugby team, could not name a single jockey riding in that week’s Ascot and could not identify three of the four semi-finalists at the Queen’s Club tennis tournament.

He made a gallant stab at naming England’s cricket coach, declaring he was ‘the Aussie’... but Duncan Fletcher was actually from Zimbabwe.
