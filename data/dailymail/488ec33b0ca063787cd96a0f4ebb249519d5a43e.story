Next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro could be a stinker...because of severe pollution in the city's filthy waterways.

Athletes have complained of the stench while practising at the sailing venue in the city, with sailors saying they have had to dodge everything from dead animals and discarded sofas to plastic bags.

It is estimated that around 60% of the city's sewage is untreated and dumped into the city's waterways which will flow into venues for sailing, rowing and distance swimming at the Olympics.

Trash: Discarded rubbish litters the banks of Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay. Officials face a race against time to now have it cleaned up for the Olympic Games next year

Rubbish: Tyres, office seats and televisions are amongst just some of the junk that is washed up in the bay

Garbage: Between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day, including household waste and raw sewage

Guanabara Bay, one of the iconic locations of Rio, is still blighted by sewage, industrial pollution and illegal dumping. 

Several Olympic sailors have complained it is the dirtiest place they have ever trained or competed in.

Nick Thompson, one of Britain's top sailors, said recently: 'Water quality is my biggest personal concern. If you are sick during the Games, it's game over.'

Ahead of next year's Games, he plans to take 'probiotic supplements and fish oil to strengthen the gut' as he bids to avoid illness.

And Stephen Park, British Sailing Team's manager, said recently: 'The sailors are on various supplements to mitigate against it, but we can't do anything about the water quality'. 

It has been estimated that between approximately 80 and 100 tonnes of garbage are washed into the bay every day - but the government only manage to remove around 400 tonnes per month.

In February, thousands of dead fish were found floating in the waters of the bay.

And in December, a drug-resistant 'super bacteria' normally found in hospitals was also discovered in the water around the bay. 

In total, 15 cities share the bay's shoreline and it is estimated that the waste of eight million people is still being untreated as it flows into the water, producing over 18,000 litres of sewage per second.

Junk: Dead fish and discarded plastic cups lie next to a burst football on the sands of Guanabara Bay

Waste: Everyday household waste litters the shores of Guanabara Bay in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro

Clean up: Thousands of dead fish had to be removed from the bay by the city's council workers last month

Removed: Guanabara Bay is blighted by sewage, industrial pollution and illegal dumping

It has been estimated that fecal matter in the city's water system can reach more than 200 times that of the limit declared legal in the United States.

Olympics organisers have admitted that the quality of water is an ongoing concern, but have insisted it will be safe for the Games.

Mario Andrada, Rio 2016 director of communications, said recently: 'There is a huge problem with garbage.'

He said the state of the sailing venue remains a priority 'because the water is not fully clean, but it will be safe for the Olympics'.

Rancid: Dead fish and garbage are seen in the waters of Guanabara Bay

Risk: Sailors will have to navigate the polluted waters, which are littered with garbage and dead animals

Slick: Pollution is a major concern, but officials at the International Olympic Committee are confident the water will be suitable for the Olympic Games

Last week, Nawal El Moutawakel, head of the International Olympic Committee inspection team, said she was confident that that the problem would be resolved ahead of the Opening Ceremony.

She said: 'We want every single venue to be ready for the athletes to compete in a secure and safe manner.

'We have been given reassurances that all the venues will meet the level...so athletes can compete.'

The Olympic Games will begin on August 5 next year, with the Paralympic Games starting on September 7.
