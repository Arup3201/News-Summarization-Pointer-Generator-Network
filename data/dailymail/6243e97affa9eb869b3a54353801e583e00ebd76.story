West Bromwich Albion fans were treated to almost half-an-hour of club coverage on Sky Sports News this afternoon, while fans of other clubs wondered what on earth was wrong with their television.

It was probably the most coverage the club has had in years, but even the most hardened of Baggies’ fans will have grown tired of the Tony Pulis video feature as it was played on loop for what seemed an eternity.

Many Twitter users wondered what was going on down at Sky Sports HQ and why they were being subjected to so much Pulis time, but it soon became apparent when the cameras started rolling live again, almost 30 minutes later.

Jeff Stelling reassures viewers that everything is under control while wearing a fireman's hat live on air

A fire drill meant West Bromwich Albion fans were treated to an awful lot of Tony Pulis this lunchtime

Jeff Stelling and co returned and explained the Soccer Saturday team had been forced out into the cold after the fire alarm in the building was set off.

As usual, Stelling saw the funny side, and returned to viewer’s screens donning a fireman’s hat with a posse of fireman stood behind him.

Thankfully the Pulis special edition of Sky Sports News has now finished, hopefully to never return again...
