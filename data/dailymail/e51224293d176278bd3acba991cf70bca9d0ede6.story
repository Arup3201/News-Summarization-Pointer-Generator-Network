The historic Bible given to President Franklin Roosevelt as a gift and used at the swearing in of New York mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday went missing, sparking a hunt involving at least 50 policemen and officials.

The tome vanished right after the New Year's Day ceremony at City Hall.

De Blasio, the 109th New York Mayor, had laid his hand on it and taken an oath in front of former President Bill Clinton.

When it went missing afterwards, panic
 ensued. A police source told The New York Post: 'They had the whole 
detail looking through blankets.'

Another insider said: 'We were looking in garbage cans outside, in all the bags.'

The
 book was eventually found several hours later by a police detective, 
who announced the end of the hunt to applause from a crowd.

The bible is embossed with a picture of the White House and was given to President Roosevelt as a gift in 1933 at his first inauguration.

In a sign of change, the 
down-to-earth mayor had arrived for his own ceremony by subway, accompanied by his wife Chirlane McKray and their children Chiara and Dante. 

Speakers at the event, attended by an 
array of guests, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 
Governor Andrew Cuomo, to stars including Cynthia Nixon and Steve 
Buscemi, reiterated his campaign theme of justice and equality.

Bill de Blasio used his first speech as New York mayor to thank the Clintons and Michael Bloomberg.

To President Clinton: Over 20 years ago, when a conservative philosophy seemed dominant, you broke through – and told us to still believe in a place called Hope.

To Hillary Clinton: Our groundbreaking commitment to nurturing our children and families manifested itself in a phrase that is now a part of our American culture – and something we believe in deeply in this city. It Takes A Village.

To outgoing mayor Bloomberg: To say the least, you led our city through some extremely difficult times. And for that, we are all grateful ... We pledge today to continue that great progress you made in these critically important areas.

In his first speech as Mayor of New York, de Blasio said: 'When I said I would take dead aim at the Tale of Two Cities, I meant it.'

'We see what binds all New Yorkers together ... the spark that ignites our unwavering resolve to do everything possible to ensure that every girl and boy ... that every child has the chance to succeed,' he added.

The new mayor renewed his pledge to extending paid sick leave law, and tackling hospital closures, as well as providing affordable housing.

Other key points of his campaign, including reforming the city's stop and frisk policy and providing better education, were raised too.

'We will not wait, we will do it now,' he said, as he talked of plans to ask the rich to pay a little more in taxes so the city can have universal pre-kindergarten.

He laid out the framework for the reforms in which those earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see tax increase of $973 a year, with the extra revenue going directly to school programs.

'That’s less than three bucks a day – about the cost of a small soy latte at your local Starbucks,' he said, adding: 'Our common cause is to leave no New Yorker behind. That's the city you and I believe in.'

De Blasio was sworn in by former President Clinton, who he worked for during Clinton's time in the White House. De Blasio, who won the election by a record margin, was also an integral part to Hillary's senator campaign.

'We see what binds all New Yorkers together: an understanding that big dreams are not a luxury reserved for a privileged few, but the animating force behind every community, in every borough.'

'The spark that ignites our unwavering resolve to do everything possible to ensure that every girl and boy, no matter what language they speak, what subway line they ride, what neighborhood they call home - that every child has the chance to succeed.'

'When I said we would take dead aim at the Tale of Two Cities, I meant it. And we will do it ... We will succeed as One City.'

'A city that fights injustice and inequality — not just because it honors our values, but because it strengthens our people. A city of five boroughs — all created equal.'

As Clinton took to the stage he thanked Bloomberg for his years in office, saying he had left the city healthier than how he found it.

He went on to introduce the de Blasios, saying: 'With all respect to the television show, they are our real modern family.'

Clinton added that he endorsed de Blasio's fight against inequality, which was forefront of his mayoral campaign.

'I have to say I strongly endorse Bill de Blasio’s core campaign commitment to shared opportunities … and this inequality problem bedevils the entire country,' he told guests.

De Blasio, 52, took his oath using a Bible
 used by President Roosevelt and, as he was officially sworn in he was 
greeted with cheers and applause. The bible reportedly went missing for more than two hours after the ceremony, sparking a frantic search, according to the New York Post.

In his first speech as mayor de Blasio called on New Yorkers to work 
together to improve living conditions for everyone living there, saying 
he wanted to create 'a city of five boroughs - all created equal.'

He
 told guests he had been proud to work for the Clintons and thanked 
Bloomberg, saying: 'Let's acknowledge the incredible commitment of our 
mayor ... To say the least, you led our city through some extremely 
difficult times.'

The outgoing mayor had met the de Blasios at a subway station, as they arrived for the ceremony. 

As the men embraced de Blasio asked Bloomberg: 'How does it feel to be a free man?'

Mr Bloomberg, 71, is due to take a 10-day holiday to Hawaii and New Zealand now his time as mayor has come to an end.

New York's new first family had been snapped on the way to the ceremony this morning, on board a subway train.

Rebecca Katz, a 'proud member of the de Blasio team' tweeted: 'First Fam taking the 4 on their way to City Hall.' 

De Blasio had two swearing in 
ceremonies. The first outside his Brooklyn home and the official City 
Hall one, held at noon on Wednesday.

Keen
 to break with tradition, the new mayoral office brought in DJ Mos, who 
is well known on the city's club scene, to entertain guests as they 
waited for the ceremony to begin.

Despite the outgoing mayor, Michael Bloomberg, sitting just yards away, the speakers didn't shy away from making indirect criticisms of his leadership.

The
 first speaker, singer Harry Belafonte, described the city's justice system, with its stop-and-frisk policy, as 'Dickensian'.

He then gave a rousing introduction to 
de Blasio, telling the guests: 'New Yorkers should ensure our mayor he 
will not stand alone in facing the naysayers of progress in our midst.'

His sentiments were echoed by the city's youth poet laureate Ramya Ramana, who read a piece of original work on unity and justice.

Actress Nixon, an advocate for city schools, then took to the stage, saying: "It's an exciting time for New York' before she introduced Broadway star Patina Miller who sang John Lennon's Imagine.

Other members of City Hall were sworn in before de Blasio, including Comptroller Scott Stringer and Public Advocate Letitia James.

Ms James, the first African-American woman to hold office in the city, told the crowd: 'The growing gaps between the haves and have-nots undermines our city.'

She highlighted the city's extremes of 'decrepit' homeless shelters and multi-million dollar apartments, and pointed out that many of those working full time in the city were having to rely on food stamps. 

De Blasio has said he work to improve economic opportunities in working-class neighborhoods and has criticised alleged abuses under the police department's stop-and-frisk policy.

Among his plans for the city is his controversial campaign to halt horse-drawn carriage rides through Central Park, calling the tourist attraction 'inhumane'.
