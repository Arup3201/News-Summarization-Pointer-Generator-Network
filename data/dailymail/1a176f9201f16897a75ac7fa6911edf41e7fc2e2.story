Rickie Lambert is confident he can still make a significant contribution for Liverpool despite a slow start to the season.

The 32-year-old striker has started just one Premier League game and a Capital One Cup tie since his £4m move from Southampton in the summer.

But Lambert believes there will be many more opportunities for him to shine at Anfield this season having so far failed to open his Liverpool goal-scoring account.

Rickie Lambert is confident he can still make a significant contribution at Liverpool

Lambert has been limited mainly to substitute appearances and has started just two games this season

He told Liverpool's official website: 'I've tried to focus on getting myself fit and sharp for when my moment comes. Whether I'm starting, or whether I come off the bench, I want to contribute the way I know I can contribute.

'It's a long, long season and I know there's going to be a lot of opportunities for me coming up. I'm confident now that I'm more than ready for when the opportunity comes.

'I've missed a few chances, which I look back on and I know I should have scored,' Lambert admitted. 'But I try not to beat myself up too much. I might have done that in the past a little bit too much.

'I'm trying to relax a little bit more and just believe in my ability, because I know I'm good enough and I'm working hard enough. It's not too far away, the first goal. Whenever that comes and whatever way it comes, it's going to push my confidence even higher.'
