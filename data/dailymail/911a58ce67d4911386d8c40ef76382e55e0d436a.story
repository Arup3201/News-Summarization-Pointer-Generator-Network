Former New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns expects to be charged with perjury this month by British authorities and will travel to the UK to defend himself, the player said on Friday.

The charges stem from a 2012 libel action he brought against Lalit Modi, the former boss of the Indian Premier League. 

Cairns said the Crown Prosecution Service had told him they intended to lay charges on Sept 25. He said he would cooperate with the authorities. 

Former Kiwis allrounder Chris Cairns was named in an ICC investigation into match fixing in December 

Chris Cairns took over 200 Test wickets for New Zealand during a career that spanned 15 years 

'I have nothing to hide and I will do whatever it takes to once again prove my innocence,' he said.

'There will now be an opportunity to face my accusers in an open forum, with some rigour and proper process around that, so that I can clear my name once and for all.

'I hope that, through this forum, significant additional information will be flushed out that will help people to better assess the situation, as well as the character and motives of the parties involved.

'I wish this wasn't the situation - having been to Court before, I know what lies ahead and how gruelling it will be and how tough it is on my family - but I have nothing to hide and I will do whatever it takes to once again prove my innocence.'

The strong all-rounder racked up over 8000 international runs during his career, just 50 short of 5000 in ODIs

A CPS spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we have authorised police to charge Chris Cairns with one count of perjury, which arises from a libel trial held in the UK in March 2012.

'We have also authorised police to charge Andrew Fitch-Holland with one count of perverting the course of justice, which arises from actions taken relating to the same trial. Both suspects will be formally charged by police in due course.'

In 2012 Cairns won £90,000 libel damages after he sued Modi over an accusation of match-fixing made on Twitter in January 2010.

In 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), which flourished briefly before the ascendancy of the IPL.

The allegation made by Modi related to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November that year.

Cairns, who notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests, has reportedly confirmed that he had been notified by the CPS that it planned to bring charges against him.

Chris Cairns now expects to be charged with perjury in Britain after being questioned by police in May

New Zealand Cricket issued a statement acknowledging the move by British authorities but declined to elaborate.

'These charges will now be tested in a British court of law and be subject to the normal processes of a criminal trial,' NZC said.

Cairns flew to Britain in May to be interviewed by British police and the sport's anti-corruption officials in a separate investigation into allegations of matchfixing.

The former all-rounder has consistently denied any wrongdoing.

Former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent was banned for life in July from all cricket after admitting to matchfixing in games in England.
