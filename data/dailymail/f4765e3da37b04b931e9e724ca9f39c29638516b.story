A police force which initially failed to fire a hero officer who allegedly had sex with his mistress while on duty is to be investigated itself, it emerged today.

The police watchdog will look at how Gwent Police dealt with the controversial case relating to armed response officer Pc Shaun Jenkins.

The 35-year-old was only fired after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered a re-investigation of his case.

The IPCC said today that it was 'concerned' at how Gwent Police dealt with such a serious complaint.

It fears the matter could potentially undermine public confidence in the complaints system itself.

Jenkins, who had two awards for bravery, was sacked in December 2010 for gross misconduct.

It followed allegations he drove to the home of his lover for afternoon sex while an officer apparently waited outside in a squad car.

Jenkins allegedly wore his uniform and left his loaded firearm on the dressing table during the 40-minute daylight tryst.

His secret life unravelled when the woman's husband found out and complained and Jenkins was hauled before police chiefs.

Probe: The IPCC is looking again at the way Gwent Police handled the case of Pc Jenkins, which it said may damage public faith in the complaints system

When he was given a final warning but 
allowed to continue patrolling the streets of Caerphilly, the woman's 
husband complained to the IPCC.

It ordered the re-investigation of the complaint which culminated in Jenkins being sacked.

Now it has decided to investigate the way Gwent Police dealt with the disciplinary matter.

'The IPCC has received a voluntary 
referral from Gwent Police which relates to how a complaint received by 
the force on November 2, 2010 was dealt with and the subsequent 
disciplinary action on December 2, 2010.

'The
investigation is into how a complaint was dealt with against a police 
officer who was alleged to have had sex on duty with the complainant's 
wife.

'The complainant appealed to the IPCC about the discipline outcome, which was a final written warning.

'The IPCC upheld the appeal and the force then held a full powers misconduct hearing which decided to dismiss the police constable.'

Tom Davies, IPCC Commissioner for Wales, said: 'I am concerned at how Gwent Police dealt with a serious complaint, as this could potentially undermine public confidence in the complaints system.

'I have therefore decided this matter should be investigated by IPCC investigators.

'The case itself has recently been reported extensively in the media and relates to a firearms officer.

'We will publish our findings in due course, which I hope will help allay any public concerns about the way police complaints are dealt with.'
