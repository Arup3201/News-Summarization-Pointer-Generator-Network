A courtroom in Cincinnati witnessed extraordinary scenes on Friday when a bereaved father publicly forgave the young woman who had killed his 21-year-old son in a hit and run accident.

So emotionally fraught was the moment Bill Walker absolved Lauren Balint, 23, for striking  Chris Walker in February of last year, that the judge admitted she almost broke down in tears ahead of her verdict.

With his wife next to him and Balint stood only six feet away, Walker told her that she was 'totally forgiven. I hope you get married and have a good, long life.'

As Walker fought back his own tears, Balint stood listening and raised her hands to her face and began to weep as the dad continued.

Emotional: Lauren Balint, (seen here in her mugshot, following her arrest in February 2013) was forgiven by the Walker family for the death of their son, Christopher

'From the bottom of my heart, I forgive you. I wish Chris hadn't been out there that night because it affected your life as well,' Walker said.

According to Cincinnati.com, Walker believed that forgiveness was the best gift he could bestow on Balint as she stared down the barrel of a three-year sentence for failing to stop after an accident.

Indeed, Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Melba Marsh said that she had not decided what sentence to impose on Balint, who had earlier pleaded no contest to the charges following her arrest for striking Chris Walker when he drunkenly stumbled onto I-71.

'It almost brought me to tears,' said Judge Melba Marsh.

Indeed, as Bill Walker, a pastor at his local church spoke, his words apparently cemented Judge Marsh's decision not to sentence Balint to a custodial sentence.

'There was no reason for two lives to be lost,' he said. 'We already lost one. We can't change what happened to Chris.'

Marsh sentenced Balint to two-years probation for the incident last year which led to the death of Chris Walker, eight days after his 21st birthday

Devastated: Bill and Mary Walker told the young lady who killed their son by accident that she was forgiven

He was struck by Balint's car at 2am on February 24, when the University of Cincinnati architecture student mistook a country road for the interstate.

His father believes his son, an avid urban explorer, was returning from an abandoned railway tunnel under William Howard Taft Road. He had been drinking.

Balint struck the student and instead of stopping carried on at the insistence of her friends inside the car.

 'You are totally forgiven. I hope you get married and have a good, long life.' Forgiving Bill Walker to Lauren Balint in court on Friday

'It was a very bad decision. It was very overwhelming,' Balint said in court last week. 'I should have stopped. I think about it all the time.'

Discovered dead at the scene, the police investigation led back to Balint, who was arrested.

'Chris made some mistakes that night,' his father said according to Cincinnati.com.
 'It's so ironic, because he promised he'd never drink and drive, and he
 was killed walking because he didn't want to hurt anyone else.'

Balint
 has been seeking counseling in the aftermath of the accident and she 
wasn't charged with Chris Walker's death at the time of her arrest 
because he was drunk.

Wrong turn: Christopher Walker was an avid urban explorer and was struck on I-71 in February of 2013

Balint's attorny, Bryan Perkins said that Walker's parents stunned his client.

'I sympathize with him as a father,' he said. 'I've never seen it at that magnitude. It got me emotional, for sure.'

For Bill Walker, though, it wasn't about punishment. It was about peace.

'It's not for me to have her carry this guilt for the rest of her life,' Walker said. 'She seemed like a neat young lady, so I hope it helps.'
