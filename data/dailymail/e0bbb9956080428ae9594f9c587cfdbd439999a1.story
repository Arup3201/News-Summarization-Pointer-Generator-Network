A military source has revealed that Florida socialite Jill Kelley reveled in her close ties to senior military men and bombarded General John Allen with emails.

Mark Rosenthal, a civil liaison 
officer for the MacDill Air Force base in Tampa where Central Command is
 based, said he was appalled by the flirty behavior of Kelley at lavish 
parties she hosted in her $1.3million home.

He warned 37-year-old Mrs Kelley, a mother-of-three who is married to cancer surgeon Dr Scott Kelley, to stop bombarding the general with emails. General Allen is the
 top U.S. commander in Afghanistan.

Dragged into the spotlight: Dr Scott Kelley leaves his home in Tampa, Florida today for the first time since his wife was found to be embroiled in a national military sex scandal

Back to business: Dr Kelley is a renowned cancer surgeon with his own charitable foundation

'I called her probably three times and told her not to send any more emails,' he told the Tampa Tribune.

'I thought it was ridiculous. Who the hell is she. These guys are protecting the world.'

The scathing portrayal came as her husband Dr Kelley was pictured for the first time today 
since being dragged into the media spotlight.

Dr Kelley, a renowned cancer surgeon with his own charitable foundation,
 was seen leaving his mansion which overlooks the bay this morning.Â 

The 
surgeon looked weary as he left home wearing a shirt 
and tie. As he made his way to his car, he glared at the photographers 
who have been camped outside his property for several days.

Investigation: General John Allen (pictured with his wife Kathy) is under scrutiny for sending up to 30,000 emails to Tampa socialite Jill Kelley

It is the first time he has been seen since his wife was revealed as the lynchpin of an FBI investigation that led to CIA 
director David Petraeus' resignation after an affair with his biographer 
Paula Broadwell.

Jill Kelley's mother Marcelle Khawam was also seen leaving the luxury home today. When asked how her daughter was coping, she simply nodded to the waiting press.

The
 wife of General John Allen, the top military commander under 
investigation for sending 'flirty' emails to Mrs Kelley, 
was reportedly unhappy about their close friendship.

Kathy
 Allen complained to the wife of the civil liaison officer at Central 
Command in Tampa about the number of emails her husband was receiving 
from Mrs Kelley.

Officials probing the links between Allen, 58, and Kelley, said there are 20,000 - 30,000 pages being examined.

One official said the content of the emails were so explicit they amounted to 'phone sex'.

Allen,
 who is the commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan and due to take
 up a position as head of NATO, has denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Rosenthal, a civil liaison officer, said Kelley was 'loud, ostentatious and revealing' at the parties where she kissed and hugged high-ranking military officials. Rosenthal said she wore revealing short skirts at the parties.

Other sources said Kelley never spoke with anyone below the rank of colonel and focused on those officers with the most power.

Rosenthal was aware the Tampa socialite was bombarding General Allen with thousands of emails. He said Mrs Allen complained to his wife about the emails and he contacted Kelley to ask her to stop.

Since becoming a key player in the military sex scandal, Kelley has had access denied to the MacDill Air Force base.

She was among a handful of civilians who had easy access to the base in her role as a unpaid liaison officer and 'honorary consul'.

As Dr Kelley braved the media glare 
on Thursday, there was still no sign of the other doctor dragged into 
the increasingly tangled web of betrayal - Dr Scott Broadwell, husband 
of Petraeus' mistress Paula.

The radiologist, who has two sons with his wife, has not been seen since the scandal broke last Friday.

He
 and his wife had been enjoying a romantic weekend for her 40th birthday
 at a B&B in West Virginia when news of her long-term affair with 
CIA director Petraeus broke on November 9.

The
 Broadwells then headed for Washington D.C, where Mrs Broadwell has been
 pictured hiding out at her brother's house. Her husband has remained 
out of view.

Both Paula Broadwell and Jill Kelley have refused to speak publicly about the scandal.

The doctor's wife and mother-of-three 
 has remained at her colonial style mansion during the scandal, 
appearing briefly in bold designer dresses for the media who have 
gathered outside her home.

She has been bombarded with offers from TV networks to conduct a sit down chat about her relationship. Friends believe Kelley will agree to talk - because she desperately needs the money.

 Bank filed a foreclosure lawsuit against her and husband Scott in April
 2010, claiming they failed to make a payment on the mansion. The bank 
demands repayment of $1.8 million in principal and interest on the 
mortgage.

Their
 company, Kelley Land Holdings, defaulted on a $2.1 million loan from 
Central Bank. Credit card issuer FIA Card Services sued Jill Kelley for 
defaulting on more than $25,000 in credit card debt.

It
 is a dramatic leap into the national media glare despite her eagerness 
to be a player on the local Florida social scene with her husband.

Dr Kelley and his wife held lavish parties 
at their $1.3million home overlooking Tampa Bay where senior military figures, based at nearby Central Command, and 
their wives were feted.
