Arjen Robben has said he is tired of people criticising him after he admitted diving during Holland's last-16 win against Mexico.

The Dutchman appeared to be making a particular effort to stay on his feet during the World Cup quarter-final win against Costa Rica on Saturday, despite being fouled a number of times over the course of the 120 minutes.

Speaking to Dutch broadcaster NOS after the match, he said: 'In recent days there has been a lot of talk about diving and actually I'm tired of this bull****.

Robben admitted trying to con the referee in Holland's 2-1 victory over Mexico, which prompted Miguel Herrera to brand the forward a cheat.

The Dutchman revealed he dived in an attempt to win a penalty - but not for the decisive 93rd minute spot-kick that secured Holland's progress to the quarter-finals.

'I must apologise,' said Robben. 'The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn't be doing that.'

But after the Costa Rica win he hit back at the criticism levelled at him since he made the admission.

'I get kicked from all sides, but luckily I am still fit,' he told NOS. 'I felt that I could make the difference, but didn't get the ball enough.

'I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I felt I was so good [against Costa Rica].'

He reserved some praise for Holland's other players, particularly substitute goalkeeper Tim Krul, who stopped spot-kicks from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana in the shoot-out to send Holland through to the last four.

'All praise and compliments to him,' said Robben. 'He saved two penalties and is now the hero of the Netherlands. I think that's fantastic.'Â

Memphis Depay, who started the game for Louis van Gaal's side after impressing as a substitute in previous matches, said he lost his voice during the shoot-out as he cheered on his team-mates.

'I lost my voice a little bit from all the yelling at each penalty,' said the 20-year-old. 'Everyone held themselves together. We showed we are a very strong team.'
