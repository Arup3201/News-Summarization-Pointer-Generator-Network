Emergency crews were called to the home last Saturday about injuries to a child.

Several people, including the suspect, were present in the residence at the time.

The girl was treated at Akron Children’s Hospital for severe internal injuries and later released into her mother's care.

West was said to have been 'cooperative' by Portage County sheriff's office and was being held in jail without bond. 

He faces life in prison if convicted.
