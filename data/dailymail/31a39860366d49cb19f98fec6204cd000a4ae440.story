Sarah Broom, 42, had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms

Sarah Broom had no idea why she was suddenly struggling to control her asthma symptoms.

The nurse had been diagnosed with the condition in 2006, after developing a tickly cough and wheeze. But once diagnosed, she rarely had asthma symptoms as her condition was controlled with her preventer and reliever inhalers.

Then, in March 2011, she had an asthma attack and was admitted to hospital after going to A&E. 'I was wheezing, coughing a lot at night and couldn't breathe properly - but, unusually, my reliever inhaler wasn't helping,' says Sarah, 42, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

Doctors gave her stronger medications, including a nebuliser, which creates a mist of higher-dose medicine breathed in through a mask, and steroid tablets to reduce the inflammation in her airways.

Sarah was admitted to hospital again that September, October and November - each time two or three days before her period. Looking back, she realised the March attack had also occurred just before her period and wondered if hormones could be to blame.

'I knew that my asthma triggers were cold weather, dust, or a cold - but, in those instances, inhalers helped,' she says. 'When I suspected my hormones could be causing my attacks, I looked back at the results of my daily peak flow meter tests, which measure how quickly you can exhale air and indicate your lung function.

'They showed levels of my airflow dropped about a week before every period, becoming critical about two days before and improving a few days after a period ended. My consultant said that he'd seen such cases before.'

Asthma - which affects 5.4 million Britons - makes airways become inflamed when in contact with a trigger, causing characteristic symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath and wheezing. Typically, pollen, dust and pet hair have been identified as common triggers - but, increasingly, evidence suggests that hormones can be a significant trigger in women.

'It's thought that 25 to 40 per cent of female asthmatics may have pre-menstrual associated asthma symptoms, with 4 to 5 per cent having a more severe deterioration, which may lead to an attack,' says Dr Adrian Draper, a consultant respiratory physician at BMI Shirley Oaks Hospital, in Croydon, and St George's Healthcare NHS Trust, in London.

And it's telling that asthma is more likely to affect adult women during their reproductive years. Before puberty, asthma affects more boys than girls; after puberty, when girls' levels of female sex hormones - such as oestrogen and progesterone - rise, more women are affected than men. Adult-onset asthma is more common among women.

Professor John Studd, a former consultant gynaecologist at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in London, says it is likely to be the hormone changes that occur between ovulation and a period starting that cause the symptoms.

As well as puberty, a key time when asthma can first develop in women is the years before the menopause (known as the peri-menopause), when they experience irregular periods and fluctuating hormones. Though asthma is often thought of as a childhood disease, it can first develop at any age.

'Worryingly for these women, their condition is more likely to be severe, with many experiencing more asthma attacks at this early stage,' says Kay Boycott, chief executive of charity Asthma UK. 'Yet years of underfunding of research - and the lack of women in clinical trials - mean the exact reasons why more adult women have asthma than men remain a relative mystery.'

Women who already have asthma may also find it gets worse around the menopause, says Ms Boycott. Indeed, 76 per cent of callers to the Asthma UK helpline are women, and many are aged 45 to 55 - the average age of the menopause in Britain is 51.

A study published in the European Respiratory Journal last year found that menopausal women with asthma had a 95 per cent higher risk of symptoms. Ms Boycott says women need to be vigilant with their asthma care during those years, making sure they have annual asthma reviews with their doctor or nurse and a written asthma action plan, including steps on how to lower their risk of a potentially-fatal asthma attack.

After the menopause, when hormone levels have fallen and stabilised, asthma incidence declines in women, unless they take hormone replacement therapy (HRT), according to a 2009 paper from the Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society.

Pregnancy can also affect asthma. During this time, hormone levels are not fluctuating, progesterone levels are consistently high and oestrogen is suppressed.

A third of pregnant women with asthma will find their symptoms improve, a third get worse and the rest stay the same - so hormones seem to affect their asthma differently, says Dr Draper.

Typical asthma treatments, such as inhalers and steroids, may have little effect when hormones seem to be a trigger - instead, some women can only control symptoms through treatments that target hormones.

'Chest physicians don't always recognise the effect hormones can have on asthma, which is a tragedy because it is easily treated,' says Professor Studd. He adds that oestrogen patches, gels and creams, which suppress ovulation and hormonal changes, can help.

In extreme cases, and once a woman has completed her family, she may be offered a hysterectomy, with removal of her ovaries followed by the appropriate hormone replacement therapy.

Yet while some studies have found that oestrogen treatments are effective, others show progesterone is the key. 'More research is needed because many of the existing studies are contradictory,' says Dr Draper. 'Asthma varies hugely among patients, so it's likely hormones won't affect all women in the same way. Treatments should be tailored to the individual.'

Once Sarah's doctors realised the significance of her monthly cycles, they tried a number of treatments not usually given to treat asthma.

Initially, she was given drugs to reduce her oestrogen levels. When these didn't help, she was given three-monthly injections of Zoladex, a treatment more commonly given to treat breast and prostate cancer, which acts on the pituitary gland in the brain to prevent production of oestrogen and progesterone.

But every time Sarah had the jabs, she initially suffered an asthma attack, resulting in a hospital stay. Last February, she ended up on a ventilator and spent three weeks in intensive care, because her oxygen levels were so low and due to developing pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) as a result of the asthma attack.

She was taken off the Zoladex, but the lack of oxygen caused lasting memory and balance problems. She was also left with drop foot (weakness or paralysis in one foot) because of the position she was put in while she was unconscious.

'Half the month, my asthma was controlled by my medication, but they didn't work when it was bad,' says Sarah, who has been unable to work since late 2011 as a result of her condition. 'When it gets worse, it feels as if I'm trying to breathe sucking through a straw that's stuck together - I'm desperately trying to get air in, but I can't.

'I was so desperate for a normal life again that I'd planned to get my ovaries removed last spring - even though I don't have children - but my severe attack in February meant I wasn't well enough for surgery.'

However, there was a reprieve - the Zoladex appeared to have triggered the menopause as Sarah's periods stopped, and her asthma symptoms improved. But last September, her periods and symptoms returned. Her consultant advised she took the mini-pill, which contains only progesterone. So far, it has been effective.

Sarah believes there are other women who haven't realised hormones are affecting their asthma. 'I don't think all doctors are aware of this link, either,' she says. 'More needs to be said about it so women can get the treatment they need.'
