2013 was a turbulent year for Francois Hollande.

The French president's country has veered from crisis to crisis - with unemployment hitting 3.29million in December and the economy falling by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of this year.

Mr Hollande's proposal to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent has seen thousands taking to the streets in protest and - perhaps most damning of all - in recent polls he was slammed as the most unpopular presidents in recent history.

And, if these pictures are anything to go by, it would seem Mr Hollande's lack of popularity has spread from his people to those in the public eye.

A series of amusing photographs - all of which appear to show Mr Hollande's handshakes being snubbed by a series of world leaders - have gone viral online.

Now MailOnline have joined in on the fun - producing our own collection of rather embarrassing snubs.
