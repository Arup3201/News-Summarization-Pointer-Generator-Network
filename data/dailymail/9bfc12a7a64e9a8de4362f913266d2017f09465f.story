This is the moment a terrified driver desperately clung to windscreen wipers as he was carried along a busy dual carriageway on a car bonnet.

Raymond Turner was forced to hang on for a mile before being thrown into the road in Camberley, Surrey, after fellow motorist Grzegorz Musial drove into him following a minor collision in a car park.

Musial, 28, had clipped his wing mirror, and they exchanged details. But Musial admitted having no insurance - saying he would pay for the damage in cash - and got back into his Ford Focus estate.

Shocking: Raymond Turner was forced to hang on for a mile before being thrown into the road in Camberley, Surrey, after fellow motorist Grzegorz Musial drove into him following a minor collision in a car park

However, Mr Turner was unhappy with this and said he would call police. Musial tried to drive off and hit him as attempted to call officers, leaving him prone on the bonnet and clinging to the wipers.

Musial, of New Malden, south-west London, did not stop - instead embarking on a journey from near a Screwfix store in the town, along the A331 dual carriageway towards the M3 motorway.

Witnesses reported seeing his car braking sharply and weaving from side to side in an attempt to throw the victim off. After Musial drove through a red light, the victim finally fell off into the road.

He suffered ankle injuries, a broken nose and numerous cuts and bruises in the incident on October 14 last year. Musial drove off, but later called police to report that he feared he had hurt someone.

In a statement read in court, Mr Turner said: ‘I was very frightened. I was worried that if he shook me off he would then run over me.

‘As the car was continuing to pick up speed I decided it would be a good idea to get off. As I fell I rolled up into a ball. I came to a rest on the dual carriageway next to the central reservation.

One-mile distance: Musial embarked on a journey from near a Screwfix store in Camberley, Surrey, along the A331 dual carriageway towards the M3 motorway until he was close to a Sainsbury's

‘The next thing I remember a lady was standing over me with an umbrella. I was badly hurt and in a great deal of pain - my face, right ankle, back and arm. All caused by the journey.’

Musial pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. He was jailed for 14 months and banned from driving for 18 months at Guildford Crown Court last week.

Mrs Recorder Ann Mulligan told him: ‘You were calm, you engaged but a point came where you took off. At that point you did something completely unacceptable.

‘The reality is it’s just good fortune that matters were not even worse. Very serious injuries were sustained, including fractures.’

After the sentencing, Detective Sergeant Yahya Aslam of Surrey Police said: ‘This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who was lucky to be alive after literally clinging on for his life through the streets of Camberley.

‘You should simply not be driving if you don’t have any insurance or a licence as you put yourself and other road users at risk. If he had sorted out insurance for himself, Musial may never have had to take the actions he did that day.’
