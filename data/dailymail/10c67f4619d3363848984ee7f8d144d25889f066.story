Tiger Woods’ return to action after back surgery did not go exactly to plan.

The world No 5 could manage only a three-over-par 74 in Thursday’s first round of the Quicken Loans National at Bethesda.

Playing his first event since a microdiscectomy in late March, the 14-time major winner struggled from the off and only a late flourish made things respectable.

Comeback: Woods had not played since late March because of a back injury

Beginning on the back nine, Woods found the bunker at the par-three 10th and missed a 15-foot putt for par.

There was another bogey at the 11th, as a 40-foot birdie attempt made it only half way to the hole.

Woods’ first birdie came at the 467-yard 14th, where he nailed a three-wood to within 10 feet, but he gave that shot back at the next with a poor drive into the left rough. A five-foot birdie putt at the next lipped out and he three-putted the 17th for bogey.

After another dropped shot at the 18th he was four over at the turn.

Back-to-back bogeys at the second and third left him six over. Woods then birdied the fourth, seventh and eighth to recover to three over.

However, he was still eight shots off the early lead set by Greg Chalmers.
