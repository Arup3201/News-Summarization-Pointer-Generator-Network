But astonished tourists watched as a loving baboon mother played the popular human game with its young.

Tourists watched as a loving baboon mother played the popular human game of aeroplane with its young baby

The touching ouching moment between mother and baby was captured by Mariana de Klerk, 54, in the Kruger National Park, South Africa

The 54-year-old teacher, who lives on the outskirts of the reserve, came across them living among a troop of 20 in March 2013.

She said there were many other young baboons with their mothers and all appeared to be in a playful mood.

She said: 'The mother and baby started playing. First she went down onto the ground to his level and the next moment and she lifted the baby up into the air just like we humans do.

'She did this two or three times. I was amazed by their interaction because it was so human-like.

'I have spent many hours watching baboons interact and never seen this before.

'While taking the pictures I just knew I was capturing something very special and unique.'
