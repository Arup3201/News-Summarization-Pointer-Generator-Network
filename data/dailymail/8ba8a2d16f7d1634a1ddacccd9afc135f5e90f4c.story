A police officer was paid more than £6,000 by his force after being bitten by one of their own police dogs.

The policeman sued for compensation after the police dog sunk its teeth into the Pc's leg during a raid.

South Wales Police paid out £6,250 compensation to the officer after he was forced to go on sick leave to recover from the bite wound. 

And the force was left to pick up a £3,650 bill for legal fees accrued while settling the injured officer's claim.

South Wales Police today defended the pay out - one of 11 compensation settlements to officers totalling more than £55,000 in the last year.

Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: 'The very nature of policing and the challenging situations our officers face on a daily basis will inevitably result in accidents from time to time.

'Officers
are occasionally involved in accidents which result in jury.

'The 
challenge of policing almost 500,000 incidents every year means that our
officers face difficult and unexpected situations on a daily basis.'

Payouts by the force to their officers in the last year reached £55,399 for trips and road accidents as well as the incident with the police dog.

The constabulary - which employs more than 3,000 staff - spent another £31,000 in legal fees fighting the compensation claims. 

South Wales Police did not reveal the details of the dog attack because of confidentiality agreements.

But Mr Lewis added: 'We continue to review our practices to ensure we make the working environment as safe as possible for all our staff - and reduce the likelihood of staff being injured while on duty.'

It comes after shocking figures released under the Freedom of Information in June revealed police forces across the country have shelled out hundreds of thousands of pounds to settle compensation claims lodged by officers.

Nottinghamshire Police has paid out £450,000 in the last five years, while Humberside Police has paid £63,189 to officers and staff who have been hurt in the past three years.

Other compensation claims by police officers across the UK, include:

An employee at Nottinghamshire Police was handed £18,400 for injuring their back after falling off a chair.

A police officer was awarded £16,610 in compensation after he fell over a pile of blankets while chasing a suspect.

Another received £8,130 from the force after falling over photocopying paper.

Another worker was awarded £10,615 after
they were burnt by boiling water and another got £4,450 for slipping on
an empty bottle in a car park.

But the biggest payout was a staggering £43,000 for an employee who slipped on ice in a loading bay and injured their back.

In Humberside, the highest payout 
of £11,450 went to a police officer who suffered a wrist sprain after 
tripping on a bag, which had been left in a corridor.

In April the Mail Online revealed a policeman in Birmingham was paid £8,000 compensation after being bitten by fleas at work.

Another sued the force and received £600 for being exposed to loud noise.

A policeman sued Suffolk Police and
was handed more than £13,000 compensation after injuring his big toe - 
during health and safety training.
