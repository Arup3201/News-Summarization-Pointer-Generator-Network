A British Elvis fan was killed in a hit-and-run just a mile from the famous Heartbreak Hotel while on a trip to visit Graceland.

Andrea Ahmed died on her 54th birthday moments after watching a tribute act perform in the legendary singer's home city of Memphis.

The grandmother, from St Davids, west Wales, had flown to  America for an 'extended trip' and had recently been to meet up with fans at the singer's former home of Graceland.

An inquest heard she went to see her favourite impersonator Joe Kent in May last year, who she had seen perform 'dozens of times over the years'.

He had sung a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to Ms Ahmed, a divorced mother-of-one, and then serenaded her with her favourite song 'Yesterday, When I was Young'.

Later, Ms Ahmed, who was staying at the Airport Inn in Memphis, was crossing East Brooks Road when she was knocked down and killed by a driver, who then sped off.

Mr Kent said: 'We hugged and said our good nights and I left her in the hotel parking lot.

'She evidently went back in the hotel and got on their computer in the lobby.

'Then she must have gone back outside. That's when it happened. She was killed by a hit and run driver.

'It's just so sad - I am just crushed.' 

Pembrokeshire coroner Mark Layton told the family that very little information, other than that Mrs Ahmed has been struck by a motor vehicle, was available. 

The court heard US authorities failed to trace the driver has never been traced by authorities in America and a 'lack of information' had slowed down the investigation into the details of Ms Ahmed's death. 

Matthew Francis, her daughter's partner, told the inquest they knew 'very little' of what happened - because there were no witnesses nor CCTV.

He said: 'From what we know she had gone out there to see the home of Elvis. It was Elvis week and she was going to meet friends.

'We know that she had a booking slip for a bus to Orlando, which was due to leave not far from the time she was struck. 

'We do not know if she was going back to the hotel or going for the bus.'

Recording an open verdict at the inquest in Milford Haven, Mr Layton said: 'It is clear that there was no CCTV, and there were not any witnesses to the collision.'
