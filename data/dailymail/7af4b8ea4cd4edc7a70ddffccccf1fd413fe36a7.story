Had India imagined the perfect way to humiliate England it would probably have ended with Ravindra Jadeja running out Jimmy Anderson after Ishant Sharma had bullied them into submission. You could barely make it up.

This was as bad as it can get for the ‘new’ England, a sorry rout that will test the resolve of Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and everyone at the ECB who have placed so much faith in them to lead the recovery from the horrors of Australia.

It was Andy Flower who said after the Ashes that life may have to get worse before it got better but even he surely could not have envisaged it would get this bad, with one England batsman after another crashing to sucker punches.

It is not the despair that gets to England followers. It is the hope they cannot stand. And for much of the final morning of this second Investec Test there was genuine hope England could make up for a mountain of missed opportunities here and pull off one of the great Lord’s run chases.

We should have known better. Instead it was Ishant, something of a mocked figure in India, who  produced what will go down as one of the great spells of Indian fast bowling but which, in truth, was a case of collective English suicide.

It is one thing being bombarded by Mitchell Johnson. It is quite another to be firstly outbowled by Sri Lanka and then bounced out in English conditions on a fifth-day Lord’s pitch by an Indian bowler barely touching 83mph. Yet that was the fate that befell England after Joe Root and Moeen Ali had taken them to the brink of lunch without further loss and to a position from which, with 146 needed and six wickets still in hand, they could afford to dream.

The final ball before the interval changed all that. MS Dhoni, almost in desperation, had persuaded Ishant to bowl short but 14 came off the last over before lunch and Root had moved to an impressive half-century.

And again: Ben Stokes looks to the heavens as the ball goes up into the air and is caught by Cheteshwar Pujara

And another one: Joe Root plays a reckless pull shot, again off Sharma, and is caught by Stuart Binny

Leaving a bad taste: Root tries to bite his bat as he walks off and (right) a despondent Prior

Then, inexplicably, Moeen ducked into the final ball and spooned a simple catch.

Suddenly and decisively, everything changed. Dhoni stuck with the short-ball policy that had failed England and one by one English lemmings fell down the Lord’s slope to oblivion, Matt Prior, Ben Stokes, Root and Stuart Broad all gifting their wickets to Ishant and sparking wild Indian celebrations.

So wild, in fact, that Ishant seemed to have to be pulled back from Prior as he walked off while Virat Kohli screamed in Root’s face after Stokes had completed his pair and then postured provocatively when the Yorkshireman was out.

It appears that bad feeling continues 
between these sides — Anderson and Jadeja face Australian ICC judicial 
commissioner Gordon Lewis on Tuesday over their confrontation in the 
first Test.

They are in danger of being suspended for part of the series
 which is bubbling below the surface despite handshakes at the end.

Those
 formalities would have been painful for Anderson, who saw his Trent 
Bridge accuser Jadeja take the game away from England with the bat on 
Sunday and then run him out with a direct hit that completed England’s 
ignominy.

It was all over by 2.46pm and Ishant had taken four for nine in 21 balls to finish with career-best figures of seven for 74 and conjure up memories of that day six years ago when he roughed up Ricky Ponting. This time his burst gave India only their second win at Lord’s, their first victory overseas in more than three years.

What a mess it is for England. Cook, with the full backing of all at the ECB, insisted he will carry on but there was unspoken recognition that his position will become untenable if he loses this series and fails to regain form.

He has three Tests to save his captaincy, beginning at the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, but how many of the senior players who were supposed to constitute the spine of this transitional side remain is questionable.

England will name their third Test squad on Tuesday and it will not include Prior, even though he had been given the full backing of a  captain who wanted him alongside him in this demanding summer.

Prior has simply not looked fit and it 
was no surprise when he announced he would step away from the team for 
the rest of the season in an attempt to regain full fitness. 

The time has come for another 
exciting new face in Jos Buttler and Prior’s outstanding England career 
is almost certainly at an end, even though he clearly does not want to 
give up on one last crack at the Ashes just yet.

Broad has virtually been bowling on one 
leg in this game and, with the chance that Anderson will be banned later
 in the series, England may rest his injured knee in Southampton and 
give another chance to Chris Jordan.

The end is nigh: Stuart Broad tickles one down the leg side for another limp dismissal

Down and out: James Anderson (celntre) is run out in a farcical manner and England lose the second Test

Giving it short shrift: Root pulls the ball to the boundary before England's collapse

Bounced out: Moeen Ali was dismissed with the last ball before lunch at Lord's

The long walk: Ali trudges off after being dismissed by Sharma with the last ball before lunch

Stokes, too, is in such wretched batting form that he could miss out in favour of Chris Woakes, with Steven Finn the other candidate to return to the squad.

Clearly, there is some way to go before England see the light at the end of a very dark tunnel. There are many who believe Cook should have gone on Monday night.

But the stakes are too high for those who charged him with clearing up the debris of the Ashes to give up on Cook the captain just yet.
