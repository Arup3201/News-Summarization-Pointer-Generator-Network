The message from Brendan Rodgers was simple. Amid all the chatter about contracts, playing time and the future, his thoughts on Steven Gerrard could be boiled down to two words: don’t go.

Liverpool’s captain might not be the rampaging, goalscoring force of nature of 10 years ago but, to his manager, Gerrard’s importance to the club, the help he provides and the example he sets every day at Melwood cannot be stressed enough.

Theirs is not the kind of relationship Manuel Pellegrini and Frank Lampard share at Manchester City. Gerrard isn’t having an unexpected Indian summer like his old England colleague and doesn’t have the assistance of an assortment of World Cup, Champions League and Premier League winners.

Many comparisons have been made recently about how Gerrard could do for Liverpool what Lampard has been doing for City but when the subject was broached yesterday morning at Melwood, Rodgers’ answer was as robust as it was significant.

For Pellegrini, Lampard flourishing is a bonus. By contrast, Gerrard remains Rodgers’ most trusted lieutenant. If he does not take up the offer of extending what has been a lifelong association with Liverpool, the issues will not be easily solved.

‘Steven Gerrard is a man in his own right and incomparable with most,’ said Rodgers. ‘Liverpool and Manchester City are different. They have totally different squads and different ideas of working. Steven’s own situation is also different.

‘I certainly won’t be retiring this summer. I will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see whether that’s at Liverpool or somewhere else. That’s Liverpool’s decision. If they don’t come then I will see what’s out there.’- From Ian Ladyman's exclusive interview 

‘He’s had 16 incredible years here and I believe he can continue to work at this level for the next couple of years. But there are other factors involved that are as much about life as they are about football. One thing I know absolutely is that it is not about money.

‘I’m sure in time Steven will talk through the things he had to consider. But, for me, there is no drama. It is about managing a player who I have always admired and admire even more after having the chance to work with him, as a player and a person. I’ll manage that to the best of my ability and the calls I make will always be for the best of the team. I have a huge respect for Steven in terms of what he has done as a player and what he has done for me in my time here.’

Rodgers, undoubtedly, believes Liverpool are a better team when Gerrard is included and his keenness for the 34-year-old to stay on beyond this campaign needs little explanation: where else would he find a player on the open market to slip straight into his boots?

Gerrard was instrumental in Liverpool's late charge in last season's title race but his costly slip against Chelsea allowed Demba Ba to score and steal victory at Anfield, from which they never recovered

‘To captain this club for the length of time he has and to take on the ambassadorial role like he has, is incredible,’ said Rodgers. ‘For me, there will always be a position for Steven here as a player. If he ever went away, I’m sure there will be a time later on where there will be a role for him back here.

‘He is a unique guy who is a proper legend of this football club. I am categorical. I want him to be here, but there is thinking time needed.’

Contrary to some reports circling at the weekend, the bond between Rodgers and Gerrard, who started on the bench for the 1-0 win over Stoke on Saturday, is strong.

The 2014 version of Gerrard does not run himself to a standstill like the buccaneer who lit up Istanbul (2005) and Cardiff (2006) but that does not mean he isn’t as effective. There will have to be some tweaks to how he is deployed but Rodgers is in no mood to dispense with him.

‘For any player that (mental adjustment) is something that needs to be considered,’ said Rodgers. ‘You get to a stage where you can’t play every minute of every game. It is interesting when we have three games in a week I get asked: “Is he capable of playing three games?”

‘But the minute he is not played in one game I am asked: “Why isn’t he playing?” With Steven, he is getting to that point of his career and he will speak about the adjustments he needs to make. In time he will make the decision for his career.’
