Ashley James shot to fame as the glamorous girlfriend of Ollie Locke on hit reality show Made In Chelsea. 

Since leaving the E4 show that propelled her to fame, Ashley has been quietly building up her brand and she's got big plans for the future.

The latest string to the model and presenter's bow? A range of stylish bangles inspired by her hometown of Chelsea.

Killing two birds with one stone: Former Made In Chelsea star Ashley James models her new range of bangles, Whistle & Bango

Ashley established Whistle & Bango, a lifestyle brand that creates postcode bangles, with her friends Ania Kubow and Rosie Parkes. 

Ashley, who models the range herself in a set of smouldering campaign shots, opened up to FEMAIL about her brainchild, turbulent time on Made In Chelsea and her battle with depression.

Speaking about Whistle & Bango, she said: 'We came up with the concept after realising how passionate people are about their own pockets of London. We decided on postcodes because because they’re quintessentially British, are so unique to see on jewellery, and they evoke a thousand memories.

'Each person has their own memories built into different areas and we wanted to allow people to celebrate their own stories and wear their heart on their wrist. 

'At the same time as celebrating our communities we also want to support them and so we donate £1 of every bangle sale to SHP, a charity that helps homeless and vulnerable people.'

Ashley's bangles are loved by Laura Whitmore, Stephanie Pratt, Fifi Geldof, and even Judy Murray - but the star would love to see Paloma Faith, Fearne Cotton, Kate Upton, Cara Delevingne and Cressida Bonas donning her designs.

Ashley, who also works in presenting and would love to design her own footwear range, is a huge fan of fashion, which is clear from her latest campaign.

Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I've been told my style is "hobo chic" - very low effort, a little bit bohemian. I would say I just wear what I like, and my style changes according to my mood.' 

Her mood, in particular her battle with depression, is something Ashley has spoken publicly about.

'It's been something I've struggled with to some degree since I was about fifteen,' she said candidly. 'But being on the show definitely accentuated it.'

She continued: 'I'm so grateful to the show but I found it very difficult to have a relationship breakdown on television. 

'The show was great to be a part of, and was full of highs and lows. The highs were incredible, and the lows were awful. I have very chilled out friends so I wasn't quite prepared for the drama.

''I'm in a really good place now though, the best I've ever been; I think I've finally learnt to cope with it.

'I'm really busy at the moment and am still in touch with the people I care about on the show so I don't miss it. I doubt I'd ever go back to it but Justin Bieber taught me to Never say Never.

Ashley is most certainly seizing all the opportunities that come her way, promising that 2015 is going to be a 'huge' year for her.

'There's lots of exciting things in the pipeline with our bangle company, as well as a few big modelling campaigns, and I'll be back on TV screens! I can't say too much at the moment,' she said.

Despite her hectic work schedule, her New Year's resolution is 'learn to take time off'.

'I'm a bit of a workaholic, I've been known to work 18 hour days - that's the trouble with being self employed there's no one to send you home,' she said.

'I also want to be a bit more selfish. I sometimes try so hard to make others happy that I forget about myself.'

Sharing her plans for the future, ambitious Ashley said: 'In five years time I hope that I'm happy and successful. I'd like to be a regular face for presenting work, my dream job is to do This Morning but whether it takes five years or 15 years, I know it's just a case of working hard.

'My friend Lilah Parsons and I always joke we are the next Holly Willoughby and Fearne Cotton so maybe we'll have our own panel show, too.

'I'm really passionate about women's health, both in terms of mental health and healthy body image, so I'd quite like to explore that passion too. Who knows, as long as I'm happy I don't mind.'

Wear your postcode on your sleeve: The bangles, which can be personalised, are priced at around £69, with a portion going to charity
