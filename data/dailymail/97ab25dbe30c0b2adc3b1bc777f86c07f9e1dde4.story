Andy Carroll has taken another step towards his recovery from a serious knee injury after coming through a spin and gym session, although the West Ham striker remains sidelined for the rest of the season.

The Hammers' record signing has not played since injuring his knee against Southampton in February and shocked followers of his Instagram account with gory post-operation pictures of his leg held together by staples.

However, after being pictured earlier this month wearing an intimidating knee brace, the England international proudly posted an Instagram picture after completing a rehabilitation session.

Earlier this month, Carroll also took to social media to reveal the staples have been removed from his leg - accompanied by the caption: 'One step closer'.

The 26-year-old has been plagued by injuries throughout his career but West Ham hope he can recover from his latest turn on the treatment table to be ready for pre-season training.

Despite an impressive start to the season, Sam Allardyce's side have fallen away since Christmas - drawing five and losing six  of their 13 Premier League games to leave them ninth in the table.

Meanwhile, Mark Noble is refusing to give up on his dream of breaking into the England squad ahead of the European Championship finals despite being overlooked once again by Roy Hodgson. 

Noble said: ‘I have made it clear what I think about the situation and I would love to play for my country. But obviously at the moment it doesn't look like it is going to happen. 

‘I will keep playing as well as I can at West Ham and enjoying it every week. You never know what will happen in the future.
