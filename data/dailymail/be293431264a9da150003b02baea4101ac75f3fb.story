A sleepy seal has been videoed snoring in the sun while lounging at Sea World in Japan.

The large sea mammal is featured in the clip resting on a rock as it snoozes in its enclosure.

Flaring its nostrils as it exhales air, the seal’s whole body rocks up and down with every breath it takes.

And despite the gentle trickle of the water adding to the background noise, there is little else audible but for the sound of the mammal snoring like a human.

Moving the camera over to momentarily film another seal in the enclosure, the film maker captures it sunbathing on a rock looking nonchalantly in the other direction.

Before moving the camera back to the star of the show and zooming in slightly – some laughter can be heard in the background.

Known as Kamogawa SeaWorld, the marine leisure centre and museum opened in the 1970s with a number of mammals including dolphins and sea lions.

Today the leisure centre boasts an aquarium alongside a section named ‘Rocky World’, where seals and seal lions live.
