When one forklift won't quite do the job, the answer really is simple... use two forklifts.

While it doesn't look like the safest work practice ever, a video of two removal workers has been posted online using a forklift truck to lift another forklift on to the back of a trailer.

The dangerous-looking manoeuvre appears to be used as a solution of lifting a large shipping box to the front of a trailer without a proper ramp or loading bay.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

It is not clear where the video was taken, but according to Yahoo News, the footage was posted to Facebook on July 2 and has now been shared across social media and blogging sites.

The video shows the first forklift lining up the container as it edges closer to the trailer.

Once the box is safely in the trailer the second, larger forklift enters the scene, the driver carefully placing the forks underneath the first vehicle.

The second forklift then lifts up the first and helps it on to the back of the trailer, allowing it to move the container further into place.

The larger forklift then helps the first back down to the ground after it has dropped off the container.

While the manoeuvre may not look like the safest ever, it is nowhere near as stomach-churning as the remarkable three-point turn Austrian driver Joachim Held is forced to complete on a narrow road halfway up a mountain.

In January, MailOnline reported how the driver carried out the manoeuvre twice a day, every day - and had never made a mistake so far.

Joachim, who began driving trucks aged just 19, has to do the perilous turn in the mountains of Eisenerz, near Styria. He said: 'I have done this so many years that it's second nature now.'

However, he added: 'I can understand why people find it scary.'
