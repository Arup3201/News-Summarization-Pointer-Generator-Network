They have been hailed as the future of technology but when they were released to developers in April Google Glass devices were also criticized by some for looking slightly geeky.

However, the voice-activated device has had a trendy makeover, and has been fitted on more normal looking frames.

The new-look device was modeled by Amanda Rosenberg, a 26-year-old Google Glass marketing manager, who is said to be dating Sergey Brin, the Internet giant's married co-founder.

The latest picture of Google Glass was posted by lead designer Isabelle Olson, according to Business Insider.

It shows the woman credited with coming up with the device's catch phrase 'OK glass' laughing as she models tortoiseshell clear frames and shades fitted with the device.

Ms Rosenberg, who joined Google in 2008, was reported to be in a relationship with 40-year-old Brin.

A spokesman for the company's co-founder said he had been living apart from Anne Wojcicki, his wife of six years. There was no suggestion that he had started his relationship with Ms Rosenberg before the separation.

Google Glass, which has raised concerns about security and privacy since its early version was released to some developers, is due to go on general sale next year.

Many people fear that the use of Google Glass with its intelligent cameras will erode people's privacy.

A recent study by web hosting firm Rackspace and Goldsmiths University found one in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, because of such privacy concerns.

According to Google, the device has been designed so that it is obvious to passers by how it is being used.

For example, people can hear camera voice commands or see someone tap their temple before the screen lights up.

But
hackers are gradually proving that they are able to modify the device, 
which has put Google in a tricky situation of trying to welcome creative
new ideas that could progress its product while maintaining its stance 
on being pro-privacy.
