Watch out! There’s a spider about! Or, to be more accurate, there are millions of them.

Britain is having a bumper spider year. And, right now, the breeding season is starting, as male spiders go in search of spindly spiderwomen.

There’s an enormous queue of spiders waiting to climb up the sides of your bath. And your garden will be thickly laced with cobwebs.

Booming: The spider population of Britain is fatter, healthier and more numerous than it has been for years

The spider population of Britain is fatter, healthier and more numerous than it has been for years — thanks to the warm autumn, which has provided a bounteous food supply in the form of flies and bugs.

Professor Adam Hart, an entomologist at the University of Gloucestershire, explains: ‘This year has seemingly been a good one for the invertebrates that spiders feed on.’ 

Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Association says it means spiders are ‘appearing a little bigger than average perhaps’.

What’s more, there are more of them in our homes because they’ve gained easy access — the warm weather has seen many people opening their windows and doors.

Yet far from getting aggravated by this abundance of spiders, experts say you should welcome them. Because the bad boy of the anthropod world is, in fact, a wonderful ally.

Spiders are extremely good for your garden — trapping and devouring all manner of insects that eat your plants. And in the home a single spider can kill 2,000 bugs every year.

Spider venom, meanwhile, has been used as an eco-friendly pesticide — and also to treat heart problems, muscular dystrophy and even erectile dysfunction.

And there’s not much point in trying to eradicate them from your home anyway. Spiders are dogged creatures who happily produce a cobweb or more a day — if you clear an area of spiders, a new colony is likely to come along very quickly.

You’re much better off — and more humane — gently sweeping them up and putting them in a covered, outside space, such as a shed or garage. Because as temperatures plummet, spiders want to be indoors.

A fear of spiders, or arachnophobia, is really pretty irrational — in this country, anyway. Our 660 species, such as the house spider, or Tegenaria, are practically all harmless.

And the average number of spider bites anyone receives in a lifetime is the same as the number of bee or wasp stings — around three. If you’re unlucky enough to be bitten in Britain, it’ll almost certainly lead to nothing worse than mild irritation.

A dozen of those 660 species are slightly more robust, and some people have been hospitalised as a result of reported gangrene-like infections after a bite.

But these infections are invariably caused by bacteria infecting a scratched bite rather than by the spider itself.

‘The house spider can give you a nip but only if you disturb it or pick one up,’ says Stuart Hine, of the Natural History Museum. ‘The venom has a negligible effect. Even the bite of the False Widow — the most venomous spider in Britain — is not as bad as a bee or wasp sting.

‘If you use a cup and a bit of cardboard to get a spider out of your home, you won’t get bitten.

‘If you don’t want to find one in your bath, lay a towel over the edge so it can climb out. They don’t come in through the plugholes — they fall from the walls and ceilings then get trapped because they can’t grip on to the sides of the bath.’

If anything, we should feel sorry for the male spiders in search of mates. Bigger females are often in the habit of eating smaller males — unless the males perform exhausting courtship rituals to keep the flame of arachnid romance flickering.

More to come: The spider breeding season is starting, as male spiders go in search of spindly spiderwomen

These include dances, jumps, gentle touches of the female spider and mini-vibrations of the web. Even if they do avoid becoming their loved one’s lunch, they are only capable of a few sad, brief acts of love before their short lifespan comes to an end. 

It is then left to the female to weave together the elaborate silk egg sacks, which each contain hundreds of eggs.

The spider hasn’t been helpful in promoting its best side. Those eight crawling, spindly legs and the scuttling walk don’t do it for everyone.

And their table manners leave a lot to be desired: they can’t deal with solids, so they liquidise their lunch by breaking it down with digestive enzymes to produce a meaty soup they suck from victims’ bodies.

And they’ve usually got four pairs of eyes — three pairs too many for us humans, who like our animals to have roughly the same quantity of facial characteristics as ourselves.

On the plus side, spiders are astonishingly sophisticated, producing silk from glands within their abdomen. The spiders in your bathroom are carrying out a complex industrial process that puts the silk mills of 19th-century Britain to shame.

Most spiders have six tiny spinnerets, pouring out a liquid, protein silk, which dries and hardens as it is stretched. 

It is as strong as nylon but much more elastic — which explains the extraordinary strength of the webs that stretch across your garden, with the marvellously intricate central designs anchored by only a few supporting threads.

They come in an infinite variety of shapes — with circular patterns connected by radial lengths holding them together. The aim is to trap prey, of course, but that’s easier said than done.

The webs have to be sticky enough to catch the victims — about half escape — and strong enough to absorb the momentum of an insect flying at great speed.

Look closely at a web in your garden and you’ll see that the clever spiders don’t design them to be symmetrical. Because spiders can move downwards more quickly than upwards, they make the lower half longer than the top half. And if one anchor point offers a safer refuge than the others, the hub will be placed closer to that anchor point.

What a brilliant little insect the spider is! So let’s embrace it — or at least give it a helping hand out of the bath tub.
