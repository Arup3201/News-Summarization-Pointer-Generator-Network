Natalie Rowe makes claims about George Osborne's youth in her new book Chief Whip which is due out later this month

A former dominatrix who claims to have been close friends with George Osborne says she watched him fight with her boyfriend after she licked his ear.

Natalie Rowe, who used to be known as 'Mistress Pain', says the the Chancellor became involved in a 'tussle' with her then-boyfriend William Sinclair in her flat opposite Kensington Palace.

George Osborne strongly denies all the allegations against him.

Speaking about her and Osborne's close relationship in the Sunday People, Rowe says Sinclair - a former drug addict and crack cocaine user - had become enraged after watching her lick Osborne's ear.

In her new book, Chief Whip, Rowe says: 'They started tussling with each other. As I leapt out of the way the sofa tipped over and they rolled out on to the floor, still fighting.

'It was the hugging-and-rolling kind of fight, rather than punching-and-kicking. I thought it was hilarious. I told them, "Come on, stop it, this is ridiculous!" By the time they’d calmed down and made up, nobody had thrown a punch.'

She says the fight happened at an all-night party at her flat in the early 1990s where guests took cocaine and ecstasy and paid for sex with prostitutes, although it is not suggested Osborne was involved in either.

Discussing the parties, Natalie adds: 'Thirty or 40 people would come. At this time Thatcherism was triumphant. There was so much money around and the bars and clubs were full of energy.

'These were golden years for hookers. Even the recession didn’t slow things down. The crowd I hung around with certainly didn’t care about anyone who was suffering economic hardship. They were unscathed.'

Rowe also claims that Osborne, Sinclair, and another friend Christopher Coleridge - descendant of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge - hung around her flat while she was with clients, sometimes even talking to them when they were finished.

When Miss Rowe met Mr Osborne, she was dating Sinclair, a member of one of the country’s biggest landowning families.

He and the future Chancellor were members of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club, a male-only institution with a reputation for heavy drinking and riotous behaviour.

George Osborne strongly denies any wrongdoing and says he met Natalie occasionally during 1993

Miss Rowe has previously claimed that Mr Osborne knew that she had an escort agency and once discovered whips and sex toys in her apartment.

She said he had 'found it quite amusing.’

Last week Rowe had her home raided by police weeks before the release of the new book.

Up to 12 drugs squad officers searched Natalie Rowe's flat for two hours but found nothing.

Miss Rowe, who once used the name 'Miss Whiplash' claimed it was an attempt to smear her ahead of the book's publication, though Osborne has denied any involvement in the raid.

Eight years ago a picture of George Osborne sitting next to Rowe appeared, next to a line of what appeared to be cocaine.

She said the party was held to celebrate her becoming pregnant by Mr Sinclair.

She added: ‘It was definitely cocaine on the table.

‘I remember vividly on that particular night I said to George, jokingly, "When you are prime minister one day I will have all the dirty goods on you" and he laughed.

Although the picture was taken before Mr Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor.

His response was to deny that there was cocaine on the table and insisted that any suggestion that he took drugs was 'defamatory and completely untrue.'

A previous statement by Osborne said: 'A friend of mine went out with a woman called Natalie and they had a child together. I met them occasionally in the autumn of 1993 and it soon became clear my friend had started to use drugs.

'He became more and more addicted and I saw his life fall apart. With his other friends I tried to persuade him to seek treatment.

'After rehabilitation he has now recovered and put his life back together.'
