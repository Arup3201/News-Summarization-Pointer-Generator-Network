Tim Howard says he is impressed with how the MLS has progressed since he played there, but insists he wants to finish his career with Everton.

The former Manchester United goalkeeper has been with The Toffees since 2007 – making almost 300 appearances for the club.

When asked whether he could see himself returning to the MLS, where he began his career, the 35-year-old admitted it was unlikely.

‘For me, I think the MLS ship has sailed,’ Howard told SB Nation, ‘I signed a new four-year contract with Everton.

‘If you cut me open, I bleed blue and I want to finish my career there. I can't foresee myself coming back. I think there was probably a chance before I signed the contract, but not anymore.’

This summer has seen David Villa and Frank Lampard move to MLS’s newest club, New York City FC, while Howard’s USA team mate De Marcus Beasley has signed for Houston Dynamo.

Combine these signings with a league that already includes a host of ex-Premier League stars and Howard predicted a bright future for the league.

He said: ‘When I was playing, the stadiums weren't half full, they were nearly empty. Very few teams had their own stadiums. The league has just grown by leaps and bounds with the fan bases, their own stadiums and the talent they've been able to attract from all over the world. There's been a huge shift and it's been great to see from the outside.’
