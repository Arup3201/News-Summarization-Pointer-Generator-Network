A man who sparked an emergency evacuation after falling seriously ill has been air lifted from Davis Station to the ice breaker vessel the Aurora Australis.

The ship, with 114 people on board, left the base on March 17 for its two-week journey to Hobart but got an emergency call to return two days later to pick the ailing man.

The tradesman was flown by helicopter on Sunday and taken aboard, while a temporary pipeline was used to refuel the ship, which had to remain offshore due to a build-up of ice in the harbour.

The ship will negotiate about 100 nautical miles of ice before reaching open water to embark on the voyage of about two weeks back to Hobart.

'People have been working around the clock to refuel the ship and they've been working in quite difficult conditions,' Australian Antarctic Division operations manager Robb Clifton said. 

'Often below minus 10 degrees (Celsius) and with a fairly constant snowfall.'

Mr Clifton wouldn't elaborate on the man's illness other than to say it was not the result of an accident or incident.

He is in a serious but stable condition in the ship's medical bay and is being supported via tele-medicine by medical specialists in Hobart.

There were initial reports the man was a scientist but the AAD confirmed he was a tradesman.

The emergency efforts to evacuate the man follows after the vessel was hampered by poor weather conditions and increasing amounts of ice.

The Australian Antarctic Division's Operations Manager Robb Clifton said he had hoped the ship could begin its journey back to Hobart on Monday. 

The Australian Antarctic Division said the man's condition had stabilised and is not contagious, but that he needed to go to Hobart for further treatment.

The man arrived in Antarctica in November and had been due to spend the winter at the base. The patient and his family have asked for privacy, Division boss Tony Fleming said.
