A newlywed couple gave up their honeymoon to make their second appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show the day after their wedding - after the bride was accused of cheating.

Emma and Daniel Cowley got engaged after a whirlwind romance and a proposal over Skype, but their nuptials looked set to be cancelled after she accused him of cheating on her at a party.

Mr Cowley, 29, agreed to appear on Jeremy Kyle to take a lie detector test - which he failed. But Mrs Cowley forgave him and the marriage went ahead regardless.

But the while the bride was preparing her make-up and hair for the big day, rumours emerged that she too had been unfaithful. 

So the day after their wedding, the couple decided to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the ITV show again to take their second lie detector test.

Thankfully, Mrs Cowley, 22, passed the test and proved she had not cheated on her husband.

She said: 'It wasn't ideal. Like most brides I wanted to be enjoying married life with my hubby but felt we couldn't move on properly until I'd proven I hadn't cheated.

'The day after our wedding should have been one of the best days of my life, but instead we spent it on the show being grilled by Jeremy.

'I didn't want to go back on the show but I needed to put Daniel's mind at rest so we could both move on with our life and put the past behind us.

Mrs Cowley accused her fiance of cheating on her at a party and took him to the Jeremy Kyle show, pictured, to find out the truth

Mr Cowley, 29, agreed to take a lie detector test on the ITV daytime show - which he failed. But Mrs Cowley forgave him and the wedding went ahead regardless

'We put our honeymoon on hold and went to Wales two weeks later. Today, we're happier than ever.'

The couple met while on holiday in 2013 but Mr Cowley was already in a relationship.

The pair had a long distance relationship - he lived in Manchester and she lives in Ashford, Kent - until Mr Cowley popped the question over Skype on Christmas Eve 2013.

Mrs Cowley recalled: 'There was an instant attraction but Daniel was in a relationship.

'I didn't want to be a home-wrecker and it was important to me we started on a clean slate and his relationship was over before we started one.

'[When he proposed] I was over the moon. I couldn't believe it when he got down on one knee over Skype and asked me to marry him.

However, rumours soon emerged that she had also been unfaithful - so the couple took the bizarre decision to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the show to take their second lie detector test 

Luckily Mrs Cowley (pictured on her second Jeremy Kyle appearance - during her honeymoon) passed the test

'It was so romantic and I said yes straightaway. All my family were in the room cheering. Like me, they were really pleased too and thought Daniel was a good egg.

'Even though we hadn't been together that long, they knew how much I loved him. I couldn't wait to start planning the wedding.'

But her happiness was short-lived when she got a Facebook message from her new fiancé's ex saying he had cheated on her at a New Year's Eve party, just days after the proposal.

Though Daniel denied the rumours, the messages continued, so Emma applied for a lie detector test on the Jeremy Kyle show in March 2014.

The results revealed that unemployed Daniel had in fact been unfaithful and was guilty of kissing and groping his ex-girlfriend.

In spite of the results, Emma decided to stand by her man and they tied the knot just one month later, in April 2014.

Mrs Cowley passed the test - proving that she had not been unfaithful - and the couple, pictured signing the marriage register, say the show helped to solve their problems once and for all

However in the days leading up to the ceremony, Daniel received a number of Facebook messages messages claiming Emma had been cheating.

The ceremony went ahead as planned, but while Emma was having her make-up done she received a call from a Jeremy Kyle researcher who asked how the relationship was going.

She explained the cheating rumours and they were offered a lie detector test the next day, which they accepted.

The pair drove back to Manchester the following day, cancelling their planned honeymoon in Wales, where Emma took a lie detector test.

The results revealed Emma, who has a five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, was found to be faithful.

Full-time mother Emma said: 'I didn't want to go back on the show but I needed to put Daniel's mind at rest. Today, we're happier than ever.'

Chef Daniel, who has now moved to Ashford to live with Emma, added: 'I'm so glad Emma gave me a second chance. I love her to bits and won't mess up again.'
