They were thought to be muck-spreading on a farm near Dunloy, County Antrim, when the accident happened. Emergency services attended the scene but were unable to save the boy.

The tragedy happened after Graham, 30, went into the tank in an attempt to rescue a dog at the family's farm outside Hillsborough, County Down.

Nevin, 22, went in to assist his brother but also lost consciousness before 58-year-old Noel was killed trying to save his sons.
