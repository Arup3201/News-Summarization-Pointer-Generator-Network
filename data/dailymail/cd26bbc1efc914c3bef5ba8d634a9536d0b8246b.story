A gang of 13 millionaire supercar owners who took their Ferraris, McLarens and Lamborghinis to China to take part in illegal races have been given suspended sentences after they sped along private roads at 160mph.

The gang - all men and aged between 36 and 62 -  crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in southern China to stage the illegal race. 

They reportedly told police they had travelled to China because the roads in Hong Kong were  too narrow for racing. 

A gang of 13 supercar drivers have been given suspended sentences after they took their expensive fast cars to China to stage an illegal race there and were caught driving at 160mph on private roads, their luxury fleet is being shipped back to Hong Kong

Each was given a prison sentence of between one and six months, suspended for two years, at Bao'an District People's Court after they admitted driving at 160mph on private roads. Other motorists reported their 'sheer terror' when they tore past. 

Police seized 12 of the vehicles, which were stopped in November last year. 

Van driver Wang Ho, 39, said: 'I was doing about 100 kph (60mph) but they overtook me like I was standing still.'

He added: 'My van literally shook when they went past me on both sides because of the speed they were doing.

'They were going so fast their number plates were a blur.

'I thought if they made even one small mistake at that speed they would kill me.'

Other motorists said it appeared the drivers 'thought they were on a race track.' 

Shenzhen in southern China was chosen for the race because the roads in Hong Kong are too narrow 

The fleet of luxury cars included Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Nissan GT-Rs which were taken over the border

The drivers have been fined around £70,000 and were warned by a judge they may not be so lucky next time. 

They were also banned from driving on the mainland for two years, the Shenzhen Daily reported. 

'The street racing posed a great danger to road safety and some frightened drivers reported to police,' Xie Xingming, deputy chief of the traffic police bureau's investigative department, told the newspaper.

'The drivers raced on rainy days, posing a great threat to road safety. Some of them drove at about 270 kilometers per hour.'

One of the drivers - only known by the surname Chen - said the punishment had been harsh and he 'had only hoped to have some fun by driver faster,' according to the Shenzhen Daily.

Reports said the gang had been seen driving at up to 160mph on private roads in supercars which included Ferraris and Nissan GT-Rs. 

The cars will now be taken back to Hong Kong after motorists reported 'sheer terror' when drivers sped past

A van driver said his vehicle 'literally shook' as the vehicles tore past people in private roads in China 

They were also said to reach speeds three times the legal limit on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Riverside Highway. 

The gang's fleet of luxury supercars was seen being shipped back to Hong Kong after the sentences were handed down.

Police tracked down the drivers after they were captured on November 6 last year, racing along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Riverside Highway, which connects Guangdong's capital Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen. 

Officers also found temporary import papers the owners ad been forced to sign to get the cars into the country -  allowing them to stay there for just a week.

The 13 were told by judges: 'Our roads are not a racetrack for the wealthy. If there is a next time you will not be so lucky.'
