This is the hilarious moment Boris Johnson gave as good as he got when a heckler cocked a snook at him.

When faced with the gesture, more commonly found in school playgrounds, London Mayor quickly raised a thumb to his own nose and told protestors to ‘bog off’.

He also faced cries of ‘Tory scum’ and ‘pleb’ as he went on a walkabout on dockyard but responded with a cry of 'lefty t*****s!'

Schoolboy error: The protestor pretended to want to shake the London Mayor's hand, but quickly raised his thumb to his nose. Boris swiftly returned the favour.

Boris Johnson gave as good as he got on a walkabout in Bristol, cocking a snook at a protestor

Trailled by hecklers calling him 'Tory scum' Mr Johnson eventually turned and bellowed his own insult back at them.

Mr Johnson was in the city to offer his support to the Tory party’s candidate for police commissioner in next month’s elections.

There has been growing speculation that voter apathy will mean a low turn out.

Mr Johnson came face-to-face with unhappy voters as he toured Bristol’s historic harbour side.

Confronted by a protestors in Bristol today the London Mayor proved that whatever a heckle can do...

... he can do better: Mr Johnson returned the age-old insult

As he posed for photographs and spoke to the press he was bombarded with abuse.

One woman shouted ‘Boo! You are not welcome in Bristol.’

A man also cocked a snook at the London Mayor, thumbing his nose and wiggling his fingers.

But Mr Johnson responded by doing the same.

Mr Johnson was also campaigning for the city’s Tory major candidate, Geoff Gollop.

Elections are being held after Bristol voted in for a directly-elected Mayor in a referendum in May.

The vote will be held on November 15, the same day as the police and crime commissioner elections.

In the Commons earlier David Cameron was challenged over claims turnout could be as low as 20 per cent.

The Prime Minister replied: ‘I want the turnout to be as high as possible, but I recognise in new elections for a new post it is always a challenge.’
