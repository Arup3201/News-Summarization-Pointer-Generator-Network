2,436 UK bankers were paid at least 1million, or £865,000, in 2011

Nearly 2,500 bankers in Britain earn more than a million euros a year despite the financial crisis, figures showed yesterday.

A report by the European Banking Authority, an industry regulator, revealed that 2,436 UK bankers were paid at least €1million, or £865,000, in 2011.

There were three times more millionaire bankers in Britain than in the rest of the EU combined. Just 739 on the continent were classified as ‘high earners’.

Germany was ranked second in the bankers’ pay league with 170 earning over a million euros. France was third with 162.

UK bankers pointed out that the figures reflected London’s status as a leading global financial centre.

The capital dwarfs rival centres such as Frankfurt and Paris in both the number of workers employed and the amount of business done.

But critics said it showed the culture of ‘risk and excess’ was still alive and well in the City.

The industry has been rocked by scandals since the financial crisis plunged Britain into its longest downturn for a century.

Lenders also stand accused of starving businesses of the cash they need to grow, create jobs and power an economic recovery.

The EBA said the 2,436 UK bankers were paid a total of £679million in basic salaries and £2.35billion in bonuses.

It meant they earned an average of £1.24million each – down from £2million in 2010 but still 47 times more than the average salary for a full-time worker in the UK, which is £26,500.

The High Pay Centre, a group that campaigns against excessive wages, said the fall from 2010 to 2011 was ‘encouraging’.

But Luke Hildyard, head of research at the centre, added: ‘We don’t know what has happened in 2012 and the first half of 2013 as the stock market rallied. You wonder whether that trend has continued.

‘And we shouldn’t break out the violins for the bankers. We are still looking at a hell of a lot of money.

‘The bonus culture created a culture of invincibility where bankers thought they were above the law. They put ethics aside in pursuit of bonuses.

‘It also increased inequality and created a culture of risk and excess in the City. These bonuses have not come down enough.’ 

The report underlined the dominance of London and the UK when it comes to high pay in banking. It showed that in eight of the 28 countries reported on, no bankers at all received more than a million euros.

ring to push through new rules from Brussels to cap bonuses after next year.
