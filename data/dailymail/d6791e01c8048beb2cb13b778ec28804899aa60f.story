Fall: Sir Derek Jacobi had to be rushed to hospital by speedboat after plunging down steps at one of the world's most luxurious island resorts

Sir Derek Jacobi had to be rushed to hospital by speedboat after plunging down steps at one of the world’s most luxurious island resorts.

The leading Shakespearean actor and star of I, Claudius was unable to walk after the freak accident at the  £1,000-a-night hotel in  the Maldives.

He was left in agony when the quadriceps tendons in both his legs ruptured in the fall. Sir Derek had emergency treatment in the islands’ capital, Male, before being flown home to London for surgery.

Fans of Sir Derek, 75, have been kept in the dark since the horrifying accident six weeks ago.

But his civil partner, Richard Clifford, revealed last night the actor – star of BBC drama Last Tango In Halifax – spent more than  a month in hospital.

He is now attending a rehabilitation unit where therapists are working to get him back on his feet, and can walk with the help of sticks.

Sir Derek was staying with producer Mr Clifford at the Huvafen Fushi resort when he slipped while descending the flight of stairs in the grounds on his way to lunch.

With no hospital on the island, he had to be taken to Male as quickly as possible, so a speedboat was commandeered for the 45-minute trip with Sir Derek lying on a stretcher.

Two days later he was flown home for surgery at London’s King Edward VII Hospital.

When the quadriceps tendon in the thigh tears, the muscle is no longer anchored to the kneecap. Without that connection, the knee cannot be straightened and an operation is required to reattach the tendon.

Mr Clifford, Jacobi’s partner for 35 years, said: ‘At first he was unable to bend his knees but now he can  flex them about 30 degrees.

‘He has left hospital but will be in rehab for another six weeks. He is frustrated but  in good spirits and looking forward to working on the next series of Last Tango.

‘He needs sticks to get around but the doctors say he will make a full recovery.’
