A dress made entirely from colourful rubber bands has been sold for more than £170,000.

Helen Smith, 42, from Prestatyn, North Wales, put the dress on eBay where it attracted more than 100 bids from around the world.

The online auction ended at 5.13pm yesterday and a total of 137 people put their hat in the ring after the outfit, modelled by her 12-year-old daughter Sian, was first listed on July 8 for only £50.

Final bid! The auction ended at 5.13pm yesterday and a total of 137 people put their hat in the ring

The eventual winner stretched their 
wallet to snap up the dress for a staggering £170,100 but will also have
 to pay a £7 delivery fee for good measure.

Helen
 was left stunned by the final price for the dress, made by her close 
friend Katherine Burnand, who spent 45 hours painstakingly piecing it 
together.

She 
said: 'I am relieved a little, relieved a lot actually. It's a huge 
relief and I'm glad it's gone to that particular bidder because I 
noticed she has put in several bids.

'Me and Kathryn have agreed that the first thing we are going to do is go away for 24 hours and treat ourselves.

Intricate: Mrs Burnand made the dress from 24,000 of the multicoloured bands, taking three-and-half-weeks to sew them together into a size 4 dress

'We will split the money fifty-fifty all the way obviously after PayPal and fees have been taken out. It's just going to be nice to that I have a bit of security for once and that I can pay the rent this week.

'I've had 866 messages which I'm plodding through slowly because I want to reply to all of them even if it's just a thank you to let them know I've read the message.

'Most of them are saying well done and congratulations and what a great idea it was to make a dress.

'I'm going to buy my son Peter a car and driving lessons and I'll stick some money to one side for my daughter until she's 18.

Wow! Helen was left stunned by the final price for the dress, made by her close friend Katherine Burnand

'I wouldn't want [to get] a mortgage because that would take it all and I want to enjoy it.

'Five years ago my husband died and I lost my house and my business so I just want to enjoy it with my family and friends because life is too short and I know that from first hand.'

Kathryn said she was 'flabbergasted' and still felt numb from the whole experience.

She said: 'I think me and Helen are of the same ilk that until the money has registered in the bank we will be keeping our feet on the floor.

'I couldn't watch the end of the auction because I don't have a computer but Helen kept me informed by text.

'If the money does come through I'll buy a car for my husband Conrad and help my two daughters financially.'

Kathryn Burnand, 50, took three-and-a-half weeks painstakingly weaving the tiny bands together to make the size four outfit.

She spent £45 on 40 bags of 600 bands and expected to scrape a £50 profit from the venture. 

Her best friend Helen Wright put the frock on eBay with a starting price of £50 and they were disappointed when it attracted little interest for the first two days.

The auction listing shows Helen's daughter, Sian, 12, modelling the multi-coloured outfit.

Mrs 
Burnand, who does not work as she suffers from osteoarthritis said: 'I 
saw Sian was into these loom bands and thought I'd give a dress a go.

'It cost about £45 for the bands and I was working on the dress for 45 hours over three-and-a-half weeks.

'It's gone crazy. I would've been happy to make £50 profit, but this is ridiculous.'

'It's not actually very nice to wear because it's very heavy,' she said. 'All the plastic bands make it quite uncomfortable to wear too.

'My daughter tried it on. She's found it quite a struggle to get on because it's a small dress.

'We're not a rich family. I'm not complaining with what I have at all, but this could be a great change in fortunes for us. These things never happen to people like us.

'I'm no eBay expert, I've only put on a few things here or there before, but if this is for real then it would be amazing.'

What a following: David Beckham (left) has been spotted wearing a loom band as has the Duchess of Cornwall

Famous fans: The craze seems worldwide with American TV host 
Jiimmy Kimmel (left) appearing on his show wearing an entire Loom jacket
 and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder (right) gives the bracelets the
seal of approval

The simple, colourful, rubber bands, are 
weaved together to make friendship bracelets and have been seen on the 
arm of celebrities including presenter Fearne Cotton, David Beckham, One 
Direction’s Harry Styles and pop star Miley Cyrus.

However,
 the country’s largest craft retailer, Hobbycraft, has revealed that 
since Kate was seen wearing one during her tour of New Zealand and 
Australia, loom sales have gone through the roof.

So popular are loom bands, that they also occupy every top 20 spot on online retailer Amazon’s current bestselling toy chart.

And
 in terms of the best-selling toys of all time on Amazon, they come 
eighth place - after classics such as a Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly, Scrabble
 and Tommy Pop Up Pirate.

Child's play: Teens and younger children can get creative making the Loom bands which are the latest craze

The
 Duchess was given bracelets by two young girls during her trip in April
 and both she and husband Prince William wore them afterwards. Since 
then, Hobbycraft said sales have risen by 331 per cent. 

In addition to jewellery, loom bands can 
be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, 
phone cases and even shoes.

Anna Protherough, Senior Buyer for Kids at Hobbycraft said, ‘The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon.

‘We
began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and 
since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been 
flying off our shelves. The options for what you can create are endless 
and these kits really can keep children entertained for hours, perfect 
for the summer holidays.’

They were invented in the US last 
year by father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng. Since then, his company, Rainbow 
Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, 
crochet hook and bands – worldwide.
