The man who found the video that shows Mitt Romney making embarrassing gaffes is the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.

James Carter put reporters from the left leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage.

He said that he had been researching films on Republicans 'almost every day' and that he did it 'just for fun.'

Mission: The video was posted online by the Mother Jones website with the help of James Carter (pictured) grandson of former president Jimmy Carter

Gaffe: In the video, Romney argues that '47 per cent' of Americans would vote for Obama 'no matter what' because they were 'victims dependent on government'

Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage

Blunder: The resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House

James Carter is also unemployed and admitted that he hopes his newfound fame could help him get a job.

The disclosure that he was involved is likely to fuel speculation that the project to embarrass Romney was part of a liberal stitch up.

Jimmy Carter ran on the Democratic ticket during his one term as President between 1977 and 1981.

James Carter's father is Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair magazine which is known for its left-leaning political views.

Plan: Marc Leder hosted the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Mr Romney made his much-criticised remarks in May. He has reportedly helped organise another fundraiser for the Republican campaign this Saturday

Explaining himself: Romney appeared on Fox New Channel on Tuesday to talk about the Mother Jones video

Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 per cent comment - only 53 per cent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates

James Carter said that when he found the clip weeks ago there was an 'uproar' on Twitter so he hunted down the person behind it and contacted them on the microblogging site.

He then contacted David Corn at Mother Jones and put the two in touch.

For his efforts, James Carter was given the credit of 'research assistant' on the finished product.

He said: 'Anytime that you can find a clip that strengthens the narrative already established, that’s what becomes a big deal.

'I've been trying to get paid for this, but it hasn’t worked out yet. This might help.'
