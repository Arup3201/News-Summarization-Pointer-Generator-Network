A Sunday service inside a cathedral was dramatically interrupted after a large block of ice believed to have fallen from an aeroplane crashed through the roof.

The congregation, who were packed inside Brentwood Cathedral in Essex, heard a loud explosion as the ice block hit the roof of the building.

It caused roof slate and ice to fall outside the cathedral and resulted in damage to its beams and roof.

Father James MacKay, who was leading the Eucharistic prayer when the incident happened, said there was a 'massive explosion' about halfway through the celebration, causing everything inside the cathedral to stop.

He told the BBC: 'I was trembling with a bit of shock.

'After a couple of seconds of shocked pause I said "right, let's crack on" and we did so.'

An usher from inside the cathedral went to investigate the explosion and discovered the building had been hit from above.

Fr MacKay said it caused a great deal of damage to the roof of the building, which is England's newest cathedral.

Unusual: The Civil Aviation Authority said ice falling from planes is very rare

'It went straight through the slate,' he said.

Following the incident, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said ice falling from planes is very rare but said it can happen around hose connections and if washers fail.

But a spokesman said: 'You can have a big lump of ice come off an aircraft as it descends into warmer air.'

He added that increasingly the incidents are caused by natural meteorological phenomena.

The CAA gets about 30 reports every year of ice falling from aircraft.

Brentwood Cathedral was built between 1989 and 1991. The incident occurred on July 1 and the damage has now been repaired.
