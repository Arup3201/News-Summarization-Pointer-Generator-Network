The biological mother of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has said she wants to meet him face-to-face but has denied she wants back in his life because of his new found fame.

With less than two weeks to go until Kaepernick takes to the field against the Baltimore Ravens in New Orleans for the Super Bowl, Heidi Russo opened her heart up about the decision to give her son up for adoption as a scared 19-year-old, 25 years-ago.

After watching Kaepernick's stellar performances in this, his breakout year, Russo said, 'Don't get me wrong, I am not 'coming out' to share in any of the success Colin is having, I just want him to know I never stopped thinking about him.'

Heidi Russo gave an emotional interview in which she explained her ongoing pain at giving up her biological son Colin Kaepernick for adoption 25-years ago

Currently living and working in Thornton, Colorado, as a dental nurse with an eight-year-old son, Russo explained to Fox 11 the heart-breaking decision she went through to give Colin up when she was a teenager living in Milwaukee.

'It is the toughest decision that I have ever made. But, for him, it was the right decision,' said Heidi.

'For me personally, I was in a situation that wasn't planned, certainly wasn't in a position to give Colin the life that I wanted him to have.'

Heidi explains that she has only ever spent six weeks with her son and is thankful to Rick and Terersa Kaepernick for taking her son out of her hands.

Speaking from her home in Thornton, Colorado, Heidi Russo also became emotional when she explained how proud she was of Colin and his achievements this year

'He was born in 1987 and I took care of him for six weeks and I was fortunate enough and blessed with Rick and Teresa who adopted him.'

Explaining that Colin never left her thoughts, Heidi says that updates from the Kaepernicks, including photos and letters about Colin's progress had to stop when he was seven as they were affecting her ability to move on with her own life.

'I couldn't move forward with my life - I would wait for her letters, I would wait for pictures. It was really hard.'

'His whole life I have thought about him, every birthday. You think about him, you don't just forget.'

In December, Heidi spoke to the Mercury News about her exposure to the media as the parent of a 'celebrity' that she doesn't really know, describing it as 'obviously a strange experience.'

'But I've been interested in getting a chance to see Colin, to be with him, since the day he was given up for adoption,' she added.

Heidi Russo received regular correspondence from Colin's adoptive parents up until she asked them to stop when he was seven years old because the pain was too great

Heidi has made numerous attempts to get back into contact with Colin over the past 18-years and each one has been rebuffed in a polite or lukewarm manner.

'I have to respect his wishes,' explained Russo.

'If and when he changes his mind - he may never change his mind - I'll watch him from home.

'When I have a chance to get out to a game, I'll watch him from there.'

During one of the brief exchanges they did have, Colin asked Heidi about his biological father.

Heidi explained to the Mercury News that she tried to contact him, but got no reply.

'I never got a response,' explained Russo. 'He has denied him for 25 years, so nothing has changed.'

Having given birth to another child Heidi wondered how things might have worked out had she been more prepared in 1987.

'I made my call on Colin a long time ago,' she says. 'I have to live with that.

'It's his life. The Kaepernicks have been great. They have given Colin everything he could want and more. They were able to raise him in the same kind of athletic environment that I grew up in. I wanted him to have a great life, and that's what he has.'

In high school, Kaepernick excelled in football, baseball and basketball, but his passion was for the gridiron.

When he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 2009 as a student at the University of Nevada, he declined and opted to finish school.

He was drafted by 49ers two years later.

From Kaepernick's point of view, he has reportedly made his feelings clear about resisting the public calls from his biological mother to reunite.

'I think he would view it as almost treasonous to them to meet with his biological mother or father,' said former University of Nevada roommate Virgil Green to Yahoo News.

'They did such a great job giving him everything he needed to be successful in life.'

Rick and Teresa Kaepernick have indicated to Colin that they will support any decision he makes regarding his biological parents.

After having failed to meet any adoptive parents she liked during her pregnancy, Heidi had come to terms with keeping Colin when a family friend who works for the Lutheran Social Services in Wisconsin introduced her to the Kaepernick's.

The couple had two children of their own and had lost another two to heart defects.

'I knew they were the right people immediately,' said Heidi, who was living in Milwaukee at the time. 

'The first thing Teresa did when she met me was give me a hug. They were such giving, wonderful people from the moment I met them.'

Under Wisconsin law there is a six-week waiting period between when a child is born and when he or she can be officially adopted. If the parent cannot cope, the child goes into foster care.

'I refused to have him in foster care, there was no way. I raised him for the first six weeks,' said Heidi.

During those six weeks, she developed a mother-son bond that complicated giving up her child.

'I think your mind and your body do things to help you forget truly painful experiences like that,' said Heidi.

'I remember going to the courthouse to sign all the papers, then we went somewhere else for the exchange. It might have been the Lutheran Social Services building, but I really can't remember.

'All I remember is that we had to be in separate rooms. The adoption officials came and got Colin from me and then took him to the Kaepernicks.

'That's the one thing I wish I had done differently. I wish I had given him directly to the Kaepernicks.
