Americans now believe marijuana is so harmless that they ranked sugar as more harmful to a person's health in a recent poll.

The survey questioned 1,000 adults on a wide variety of topics ranging from health to politics to religion.

One of the questions asked which substance 'is more harmful to a person's overall health:' marijuana, sugar, tobacco or alcohol?

Big bads: Americans see sugar as more harmful thank marijuana but not as bad as alcohol or tobacco

According to the results, tallied by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 49 per cent ranked tobacco as most harmful followed by alcohol at 24 per cent, sugar at 15 per cent, marijuana at 8 per cent, all at 3 per cent, and not sure at 1 per cent.

The full poll can be read here.

The results are just the latest evidence of sugar's image problem, with the sweet carb being called the 'new tobacco' by doctors earlier this year.

Food giants are being told to cut the amount of sugar they use because it has become the ‘new tobacco’.

Doctors and academics say levels must be reduced by up to 30 per cent to halt a wave of disease and death.

They found that even zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four.

The equivalent of 11 teaspoons are found in a small Starbucks caramel Frappuccino with whipped cream. A Mars bar has eight.

‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool.

‘Everywhere, sugary 
drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and 
children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health.

The obesity epidemic is generating a huge burden of disease and death.

However marijuana is not without health risks, as use can lead to early onset psychosis and the effects of use on the developing brain.

But there have been no documented deaths from marijuana overdose and there are medicinal applications for pot.

'Anyone
 who takes a truly objective look at the evidence surrounding these 
substances could not possibly arrive at any other conclusion,' Mason 
Tvert of the Marijuana Policy Project, told 
The Huffington Post.

'The public's understanding of marijuana is more in
 line with the facts than ever before. Marijuana is not entirely 
harmless, but there is no longer any doubt that it poses far less harm 
to the consumer than many of the legal products engrained in American 
culture.'
