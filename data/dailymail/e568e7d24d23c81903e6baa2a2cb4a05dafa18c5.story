Apple co-founder Steve 'Woz' Wozniak is set to join the teaching staff at Sydney's University of Technology after accepting his first ever adjunct appointment.

The appointment marks the first time Wozniak, who invented the first Apple computer in a garage with Steve Jobs, has taken up an adjunct professor role in any university across the world.

Wozniak has been working with staff and students in the university's 'Magic Lab' - part of the centre for innovation and enterprise research, which looks at robotics and artificial intelligence.

'Woz loves the energy, the vibe and the robots in the Magic Lab,' lab director Professor Mary-Anne Williams said. 

'He beams in on our telepresence device to chat with students, share his latest ideas and entertain with jokes and the occasional prank.

'Woz constantly highlights the new possibilities for technology to change the world and enjoys sharing his insights and experiences. The students have been totally wowed by the attention he has given them – one claiming he had changed her life in less than 60 seconds.'

Wozniak is widely credited for inventing the Apple I and Apple II computers back in 1976.

'It's hard to imagine a more iconic mentor for UTS students than one of the most influential technology pioneers of the modern era," UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Glenn Wightwick said.

'His history aside, Steve Wozniak remains a leading voice in innovation and a promoter of creativity and ingenuity, especially among the young technologists who will take the next step,' Prof Williams said. 

'Woz is a strong advocate for technology and its impact on society.

'He constantly highlights the new possibilities for technology to change the world and he will be working with us to help UTS reach its vision to be a leading university of technology.'

Wozniak is expected to arrive for his second visit to the UTS City Campus in December. 

While the conditions of his appointment were not revealed, he will spend up to three periods a year teaching at the lab and will interact with students remotely.
