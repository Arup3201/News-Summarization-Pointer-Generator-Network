John Carver and Steve Stone are set to take caretaker charge of Newcastle United’s next two matches.

The Magpies entertain Burnley on New Year’s Day before travelling to Leicester City on Saturday in the third round of the FA Cup.

And with Alan Pardew set to be confirmed as Crystal Palace boss later on Tuesday, Carver and Stone were taking training in his absence at Newcastle’s North Tyneside base.

The Geordie duo were left in the dark about the manager’s intention to quit the club and their future remains unknown. 

Carver has a 100 per cent record as caretaker of his hometown club having overseen a 3-0 win against Blackburn in 2004 in the wake of Sir Bobby Robson’s sacking.

Names such as Tony Pulis, Steve McClaren, Steve Bruce and current Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini are in the frame to succeed Pardew.
