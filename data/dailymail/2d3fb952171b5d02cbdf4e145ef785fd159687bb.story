Gary Neville admits Manchester United aren't good enough to win the Premier League.

Louis van Gaal's men are already a massive 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after winning just three of their opening eight games.

Daley Blind's late equaliser spared United's blushes at West Brom on Monday night, and former Red Devils defender Neville  reckons the title is beyond them.

Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Neville said: 'At this moment in time this Man United team isn't good enough to win the league. 

'Louis van Gaal asked for three months when he came in and he's reassessed that. It's a tougher job than he imagined and in the next eight games they've got tough opponents.

'At the start of the season after eight games you would have said they would have been on 16 or 17 points. There's been a lot of upheaval. It's been tough for him. 

'Coming out of the World Cup he was drunk with praise, but I think it's sobered him up slightly.

'There's a big belief, I think he will get it right. A lot of good players have been signed but there's been so many injuries, particularly in defence. 

'There's something there but it's going to take him longer.'
