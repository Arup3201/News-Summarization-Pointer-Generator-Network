They wear bejewelled collars, dress in the finest fashions and eat their supper at expensive restaurants: welcome to the jet-set world of Hong Kong's most indulged canine residents.

But it's not all fashion and food. As these incredible photos reveal, the city's pampered pooches also enjoy days out at the spa where their fur is turned into a rainbow of neon colours, and spend their Sundays snoozing on the beach.

Nowhere is the penchant for mollycoddled pets more apparent than in the fishing village of Sai Kung, where dogs are very firmly considered to be members of the family.

Just outside the city, Sai Kung is one of the most canine-friendly spots on the planet, with streets lined with chic dog boutiques and restaurants that rush to welcome the four-legged friends of their customers.

But while Sai Kung has the highest concentration of dog fans, the rest of the Chinese megalopolis isn't far behind.

Hong Kong has experienced a boom in dog ownership in recent years, with an estimated 174,975 canines believed to live in the city.

To cater for them, huge numbers of dog-related businesses have sprung up, with everything from baths to walks and even funerals laid on.

Other popular local treats include 
lunch at one of the city's many dog restaurants or a visit to one of the
 stores in the Three Dogs Bakery franchise, which sells organic cakes, 
pies, chews and other dog friendly treats.

More still splash their cash on designer doggie gear, with collars bought from Hermes or Gucci not uncommon.

Others choose to dye their pets' hair in rainbow hues and all boast neatly manicured claws and regularly shampooed fur.

So what's behind Hong Kong's love of dogs? According to photographer Brian Cassey, the low birth rate in Hong Kong could be to blame.

'Hong Kong has one of the lowest birth rates in the world,' he explains. 'With few actual babies, people have found substitutes to splash their love, attention and money on - in the form of some very pampered pooches.'
