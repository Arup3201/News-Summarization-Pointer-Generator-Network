This week the 2014 UK Lingerie Awards honoured the brightest stars in the women's underwear market at a star-studded ceremony.

A glance at the winners (scroll down for a full list) may give British men help on where they should head to buy Christmas lingerie presents - but how do they decide on specifics? 

It's a staple gift but many men are clueless when it comes to buying underwear for their other halves, opting for unsuitable bras, knickers, basques and suspender belts.

Racy lace: Gossard prove why they were named the UK's 'Favourite Lingerie Brand of the Year' with this Vintage Glamour Slip, £49

Almost one in four women (24 per cent) claim they been given sexy underwear gifts from a partner that they have never worn.

And most women say it's because it was the wrong size, uncomfortable or too skimpy. One in five wear the gift just once before hiding it away.

Sex appeal: Chantelle were named 'Lingerie Brand of the Year' thanks to designs like this Palazzo Push-up bra, £68, Waist Cincher, £65, Tanga briefs - £36

Comfort and style: Opera Half cup bra £60, and Shorty briefs £36  (l) and Palazzo half cup T-shirt bra, £66, and Shorty briefs £38 (r) by Chantelle

However well over a third (39 per cent) of recipients of undesirable undergarments admitted they had not told the men in their lives their true feelings about the gift for fear of 'hurting their feelings'. 

Four out of ten of men questioned said they were embarrassed to enter lingerie departments and just over a third (35 per cent) wrongly quoted their partners size when asked.

The poll of Debenhams customers also found that while two thirds of women had been given lingerie at some time as a present, only 26 per cent said their partners had bought something they really liked.

Women also expressed concern that risqué underwear would be a more popular gift this year because of the publicity surrounding the much awaited film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey due to hit the cinema on Valentine's Day next year.

The two sexes have very differing tastes. 

Bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women but this subtler version of the shade can't fail to impress: Tutti Rouge Beatrice Rouge Noir, bra, 28, knickers, £14 (l) and Gossard SuperBoost Lace Foil Padded Plunge Bra - £32, Thong - £14, Suspender - £20 (r)

Be daring: Gossard Temptation Deep V Bra, £39, Waspie Suspender, Thong - £24

F&F Sequin Soft Bra £15 and High Waisted Knickers £10 (l) and Angelina Plunge Bra £12 and Mini Knickers £5

Find underwear to compliment her figure: Pictured on the model is Janet Reger, Reger Noir at Debenhams, bra £28, knickers £12.50, and suspender belt £20

Sharon Webb, head of lingerie buying and design at Debenhams, says:

Fishnet style lingerie, thongs or cut-out knickers were disliked by 75 per cent of women, although 54 per cent of men think a thong is sexy. Among men under 35 years old, this figure rose to 78 per cent. 

Bright red was a turn off for more than two out of three women (68 per cent) while six out of ten men (61 per cent) said it was their favourite underwear colour, followed by black (32 per cent).

Men also liked the classic boudoir image of matching lace, suspenders, sequins, bodices and stocking all in the brightest colours.

However, women said they do like to wear sensual underwear saying it made them feel more desirable and confident, with eight out of 10 saying that they owned romantic sets they brought out for special occasions.

But they added they liked underwear to be practical and able to be worn in everyday life, not just the bedroom. Women also like softer fabrics in more understated tones and lingerie which was flattering, but also comfortable. 

Uplifting: Curvy Kate won the marketing campiagn of the year, pictured is their Daisie Ruby AW14 bra £28, and knickers £14.50

In an attempt to prevent men making disastrous choices this Christmas, Debenhams, who were crowned the UK's Favourite Retailer at the Lingerie Awards, are trialling its first Lingerie Couple's Clinic at its flagship Oxford Street store.

The project aims to help men find the perfect lingerie present by familiarising them with desirable choices that also help make their partner feel confident, comfortable and positive.

The first ever clinic took place last night, December 4, where experts were on hand to advise on fit and style plus matched up what one partner likes to look at with what the other might enjoy wearing.

Men can  attend the Clinic without their partners for one-to-one expert advice on picking the perfect underwear gift to surprise the woman in their life.

Sharon Webb, Head of Debenhams lingerie says: 'There are many tips that we can pass on to men to help ensure any lingerie they buy pleases the women in their lives as well as themselves, but it is important that they get the basics right such as buying the right size.

'This is where the Lingerie Couple's Clinic will really help in identifying the different brands that will fit a particular female body shape and in a style and colour that makes the wearer feel both comfortable and confident. 

'We know that many men don't feel at ease in lingerie departments so our first 'clinic' will be in a relaxed environment where people can get one to one attention and hopefully leave with a gift they know will be well-received.'
