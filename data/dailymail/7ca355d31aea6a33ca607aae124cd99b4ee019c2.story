Scientists may have found the oldest known remains of a ‘northerner’.

Analysis of a leg bone fragment unearthed from a cave in Cumbria suggests it is more than 10,000 years old, making it the earliest human bone from northern Britain on record.Scientists from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Nottingham have published the radiocarbon analysis results in the Journal of Quaternary Science.

‘The earliest evidence for humans [in the north of Britain]
after the end of the last Ice Age is stone tools,’ said Dr Dave Wilkinson, an
ecologist at LJMU and one of the authors of the study.

‘Now we actually have one of the people as well.’

Dr Wilkinson said the scientists are 100 per cent sure the
bone is human and believe it is very likely to have belonged to an adult.

Additional analysis, including testing for DNA and assessing
the make-up of the bone chemistry, could possibly help determine the gender and
localise the fragment further.

Dr Wilkinson said: ‘We are a regional university and we have
an awful lot of our students from north west England. It’s nice to add to the
history of the area.’

Ian Smith, an archaeologist and PhD student at LJMU, said: ‘Previous
cave burials of humans from around this date have been in southern England,
with later dates further north.

‘However, the date of this human femur is contemporary with
the earliest post-glacial human bones from caves in the south suggesting
similar ritual behaviour in both Cumbrian and Somerset caves at the same time.’

The bone was discovered along with horse and elk remains,
which are believed to date from a 'warm snap' at the end of the last Ice Age
around 12,000 years ago.

All the bones, now housed at The Dock Museum in
Barrow-in-Furness, were excavated from Kents Bank Cavern on the north side of
Morecambe Bay in the early 1990s.
