Good Samaritans: Debbie and Chico Jimenez, he founders of a ministry in Daytona Beach, Florida, have been fined and threatened with jail for serving up meals to the homeless in a public park

A Florida couple who have been feeding the homeless in a Daytona Beach park for the past year were slapped with fines and barred from offering any more meals to the needy.

Until last week, Debbie and Chico Jimenez, the founders of Spreading the Word Without Saying a Word Ministry, have hosted communal meals every Wednesday at Manatee Island Park.

But on May 7, Daytona Beach Police descended on the site of the gatherings, giving a $300 fine each to Debbie and Chico for breaking a local law that prohibits private individuals from feeding a crowd without a permit.

Law enforcement officials also warned the couple that they could face jail time if they continue serving home-cooked meals to more than 100 homeless people at the park.

The husband and wife were given 10 days to either pay the fines or go to court, but Mrs Jimenez, 52, a retired auto parts store manager, says she and her husband are preparing for a legal battle.

‘The police don’t like it. But how can we turn our backs on the hungry? We can’t,’ she told NBC News.

Besides the Jimenezes, police officers fined four volunteers who were on hand last Wednesday to help the couple serve up hotdogs and macaroni salad to dozens of people, including children.

Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood said Mr and Mrs Jimenez had been warned a week earlier to stop throwing their so-called 'birthday parties' for the homeless at the park after nearby residents complained about vagrants relieving themselves on the ground and stumbling around drunk.

‘We have an ordinance that says when people want to perform acts of kindness or charity that they must coordinate with our local social service agencies,’ the police chief told the station.

However, the Jimenezes contend that no one ever told them to stay away from the park.

‘We've been down there a year, and the police have been around and not one of them has ever said one word,’ Chico Jimenez said.

‘This time, the police said we are creating more homeless people by feeding them in the park, that we are enabling them by giving them one meal in a week. Does that make sense to you? It’s so crazy.’

Mr Jimenez, 60, a retired construction manager, has been documenting their charitable work – and their struggle against local police - in videos and online posts.

Last week, he shared on YouTube a clip of their final feeding session last Wednesday, which depicts police officers arriving at the park and confronting him and his volunteers.

‘You’ve got to have permits,’ an officer could be heard saying.

The tale of the devoutly Christian couple barred from feeding the hungry has gone viral, drawing intense interest from national media outlets.

On his Facebook page, Mr Jimenez wrote Tuesday that he and Debbie have interviews lined up with The Today Show, Fox News' Greta Van Susteren and Aljazeera America.

The husband and wife team do not plan to shut down their ministry any time soon.

In a status update this morning, the 60-year-old Mr Jimenez asked their supporters to let them know if there is a building available for them to resume their feeding sessions.

‘Instead of feeding every Wednesday, God is opening the door to feed every day,’ the man wrote.

Besides offering home-cooked meals, the couple have been accepting donations toward clothing,  hotel rooms and bicycles for their vagabond friends. 

Daytona Beach is one of a dozen cities across the country that have been clamping down on haphazard feedings of homeless people in public parks – a controversial practice which many believe causes more harm than good in the long run.

Officials in Daytona Beach say that what the Jimenez couple do not take into account is that their ‘birthday parties’ may attract sex offenders, criminals and other undesirable elements to a public park intended for the use of families, kids and dog owners.

But the husband and wife told The Daytona Beach News-Journal they believe that the city does not want them to feed the needy because it means fewer of them would seek help from government agencies, which rely on the homeless for funding.
