A taxi driver had his nose broken during a terrifying ordeal in which he was beaten up, robbed, kidnapped, car-jacked and driven nearly 200km by a drunken passenger in NSW's Hunter region.

The cabbie picked up the customer from hell in Kurri Kurri on Saturday morning and was asked to drive to Newcastle, a trip which usually takes around half an hour.

Police say that on the way, the intoxicated passenger asked to be driven to a caravan park in Maitland to collect money for the fare.

By the end of the horrifying ordeal, involving a high-speed police chase, the cabbie ended up battered and bruised all the way in Moorland - nearly 200km away from the Lower Hunter Valley city of Maitland.

Terrifying ride: The taxi driver picked the drunken man up in Kurri Kurri. When they got to Maitland the passenger ambushed, robbed and beat the cabbie. The intoxicated passenger then drove the car almost 200km to Moorland

On arrival at the caravan park, what started out as an ordinary job turned violent.

The driver and passenger went inside a cabin where it's alleged the passenger pulled out a knife, kicked the taxi driver in the head and took his wallet.

The passenger then allegedly forced the taxi driver into the passenger seat and cut the wires to the taxi meter, radio and CCTV system.

Taking control of the wheel, the inebriated criminal started speeding north on the Pacific Highway.

Police used road spikes to stop the taxi after detecting it travelling at 185km/h on the Pacific Highway at Moorland near Johns River.

A 28-year-old man was arrested and taken to Taree Police Station, where a breath-analysis test returned a reading of 0.106.

'Taree police received reports from a number of members of the public of the cab driving north on the Pacific Highway at excessive speeds,' Inspector Neil Stephens, from the Manning Great Lakes Local Area Command, told The Maitland Mercury.

'Taree Highway Patrol clocked the vehicle at 185 km/h just north of Taree and thereafter engaged in a police pursuit.'

The offender will face bail court in Port Macquarie on Sunday after being charged with aggravated kidnapping, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, car jacking, armed robbery, predatory driving, driving speed dangerous, Skyeâ€™s Law (for those who deliberately try to avoid arrest by starting high-speed police chases) and mid-Range PCA.

The taxi driver was taken to Manning Base Hospital suffering swelling, abrasions and bleeding to his face, and a broken nose.

He is reportedly shocked by the ordeal.
