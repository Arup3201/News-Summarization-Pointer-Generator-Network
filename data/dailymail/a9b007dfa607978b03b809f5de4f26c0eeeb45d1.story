Replacing lost socks costs the average household £137 a year, according to a new survey.  

It is estimated that ten million individual socks go missing in the UK every 12 months, leaving scores of men wearing odd pairs.

This seemingly minor misdemeanour can ruin a man’s love life or damage his chances of landing a top job, according  to the survey by online retailer socked.co.uk.  

Mismatch: A poll of single women revealed 70 per cent would ditch a man who wore odd socks on a date

It revealed 70 per cent of single women say that if their date turned up wearing odd socks, they would not see him again.

The women surveyed said it showed a lack of effort, while others said they wanted someone who took pride in their looks.

And those who wear mismatched socks could be missing out when it comes  to their careers, too.

Eight in ten bosses said  they would think twice about promoting an employee  who wore odd socks.

The survey also showed that half of men do not buy their  own socks but rely on gifts  from friends and family for Christmas and birthdays.

Image consultant Angela Marshall said: ‘People can avoid odd socks by just keeping them in pairs in their drawers.’
