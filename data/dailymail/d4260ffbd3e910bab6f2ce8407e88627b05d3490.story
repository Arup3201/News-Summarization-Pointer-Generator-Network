Politicians can frequently be found on the phone, but in the hands of sexting offender Anthony Weiner the device is an unfortunate reminder of the dirty habits that have left his campaign with an uphill struggle in the polls. 

Maybe he was innocently checking his schedule, but Weiner really ought to keep his cell phone in his pocket when he’s addressing the New York public which is rapidly losing faith in him since his latest sexting scandal broke last week.

One poll earlier this week has Weiner, 48, falling from front-runner to fourth place in two weeks, with 65 percent of voters citing his behavior as a major issue for his campaign.

What's going on here then? Anthony Weiner can't resist playing with his cell phone while he supposed to be canvassing for votes

You've got mail: Anthony Weiner remains transfixed on his phone during Wednesday's mayoral candidates forum

On Wednesday Weiner along with several other candidates, including Bill Thompson and John Liu, attended a New York City Mayoral Candidates Forum at La Marina Restaurant, 348 Dyckman Street.

But Weiner’s attention appeared to be elsewhere as he remained glued to his phone while his rivals spoke.

He does of course have a lot on his mind, with Sydney Leathers basking in the spotlight following her sexting revelations and his spokeswoman Barbara Morgan launching an expletive-laden rant at an ex-intern who wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering campaign.

Morgan remains adamant she won’t quit her job despite her behavior, but the sexting business just won’t go away.

Even when Anthony Weiner puts his phone down he appears to remain preoccupied with it until he finally gets his turn to talk

Weiner was quizzed about his now notorious alias, Carlos Danger, on the campaign trail on Thursday.

In his first live, on-air interview since news of his latest sexting scandal broke, Weiner told Univision’s Satcha Pretto that the bizarre alias was 'a joke between [him] and one person' (Leathers) and that he would 'not comment on it' further.

Mayoral rival Rev. Erick Salgado has taken umbrage with Weiner over his choice name.

Salgado said it was an insult to the Latino community and has demanded that Weiner apologize, reports Fox News.

The underfire NYC mayoral hopeful also said he was happy for his critics to continue to look into his shady past, reports ABC.

'If people want to continue to look at my background and make fun of things in my personal life, they are welcome to,' he told the Spanish-language television station.

It is an offer that few can resist, including Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who shared his medical opinion this week that Weiner is 'psychologically unfit' to be the mayor of New York City.

'Congressman King never wanted me to become mayor. I fight with him every single step of the way [on immigration overhaul] just like I will when I’m mayor. I’m not looking for Peter King’s vote. In fact, I’d be a little ashamed if I had it,' was Weiner's response to Pretto.

Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month

Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, 
Weiner's humiliated wife, have told People magazine that she began to 
beat herself up because her husband returned to phone sex after they 
stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up 
more of her time.

However, after returning to counseling, 
she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he
continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including 
22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by 
making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media 
appearances.

While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claim in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband.

'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine.

'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine.

'Any woman could have understood that.'

Indeed, Abedin and New York mayoral candidate Weiner let their friends know that their marriage might end.

Their friends let People magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago.

'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.'

However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself.

He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.

However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son.

'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari.

'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?'

Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son.

'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine.
