Food prices are expected to surge after the worst drought in the U.S. for half a century destroyed one-sixth of the country's expected corn crop over the past month.

The hottest July in U.S. history has caused irreparable damage to crops, forcing corn farmers to abandon fields greater in area than Belgium and Luxembourg.

Soyabeans, which are used for animal feed and to make vegetable oil, have also been affected, with this harvest likely to be the worst for five years.

Damaged: The worst drought for half a century in the U.S. has destroyed one-sixth of the country's expected corn crop

The crisis has prompted the US 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to forecast record-breaking price 
rises, and some of the world's largest food manufacturers, including 
Kraft, Tyson and Nestle, have already indicated that they will pass on 
the increase to consumers.

USDA now expects 10.8billion bushels of corn to be produced this year - 2.2billion bushels less than the projection it made last month.

USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber told the Financial Times: 'We're going to see very high prices.'

The problem could have far-reaching consequences internationally.

In 2007-08, high food costs led to 
riots in more than 30 countries, but Jose Graziano da Silva, the 
director general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, said the
 current crisis was not as severe.

'We do not have the demand pressure from China and India as five years ago.'

Poor corn: The US Department of Agriculture has significantly reduced its forecasts for crop harvests

The situation has worsened since the week ending July 29, when USDA found that 48 per cent of the nation's corn crop was either poor or very poor.

The department said 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor 
condition.

They were the worst ratings since the drought of 1988, which cut production by 
20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars.

With grazing pastures also parched and feed prices at record highs, 
many ranchers are sending their animals to slaughter early because it is
 too costly to keep them until full size.

President Barack Obama's 
administration has opened up protected US land to help farmers and 
ranchers and has encouraged crop insurance companies to forgo charging 
interest.

It has also provided emergency 
low-interest loans to farmers in 31 states, where disaster areas have been declared due to the drought.
