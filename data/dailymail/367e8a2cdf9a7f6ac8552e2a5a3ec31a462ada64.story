Nothing draws a more scathing response from Roger Federer than the suggestion that the established order in men’s tennis may be breaking up, but the evidence continues to grow.

This season has yielded four different Grand Slam winners, two of them from left field, and the newest resurfaced on Tuesday, bleary-eyed after three hours’ sleep.

Marin Cilic, who hammered a hesitant Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 on Monday to win the US Open title, is one of several players putting a fresh complexion on the top 10 that, for the first time in six years, is missing Andy Murray’s name.

Wearied by nightclubbing into the early hours he may have been, but the 25-year-old Croatian was still able to give a reasoned assessment of how things stand.

Federer is right that the top three remain in situ, but with Rafael Nadal’s participation for the rest of the season uncertain due to his wrist injury, their lock on the game looks less secure.

‘I felt there was an opening this year,’ said Cilic. ‘Rafa didn’t play the last two months, Stan (Wawrinka) was up and down after his success in Australia, Andy had a back operation and this season didn’t play as great as we have seen him in previous years — so it was an opportunity for other players.

‘The top guys are still going to be there. I don’t know next year if we are going to see more new champions but for sure people like me, (Milos) Raonic, (Grigor) Dimitrov, Nishikori and (Juan Martin) del Potro when he comes back.

'I feel our percentages are going to be much higher compared to the usual top four that we have been used to seeing.’

Murray now faces a real challenge to qualify for the eight-man field at the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at London’s O2 Arena in November. Barring freak results, or Nadal being absent, there are effectively only three spots still available as Cilic and Wawrinka’s Grand Slam titles will get them in.

Murray’s ranking is rather falsely depressed, however, as he did not play from mid-September onwards in 2013, meaning that the only way should be up for him over the next couple of months.

He is likely to play four events between now and London (two in Asia and two in Europe) and will probably need to perform strongly in three of them to make it. That is likely to happen if he can replicate the aggressive form he showed for two-and-a-half sets against Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals in New York.

There are likely to be ranking points on offer as the top three’s participation may be limited before November. Aside from Nadal’s condition, Federer may ease off after a heavy schedule this year while Djokovic is likely to be preoccupied with the birth of his first child.

Nevertheless, the chasing pack are now emboldened as never before against the quartet who have so dominated the sport — in part due to the influx of ex-Grand Slam winners without much prior experience now working with them as coaches, such as Goran Ivanisevic with Cilic.

‘Before he was with 50 kilos over his back. I told him just go play and enjoy it, show the world what you can do,’ said Ivanisevic, who won Wimbledon in 2001. ‘Ex-players are the best coaches, if they have the time.’

One clear thing has emerged from a less predictable than expected Grand Slam season — there has never been a better time for former champions looking to get back into the game.
