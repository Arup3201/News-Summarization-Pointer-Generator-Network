A Tory MP has announced her engagement to a BBC presenter - after just two months together.

Charlotte Leslie, 36, is set to marry BBC Radio Bristol host John Darvall, who she began dating in October last year.

The twice-divorced father-of-four, who is in his 50s, popped the question on Christmas Day and the Bristol North West MP described the moment as 'just completely natural and lovely'.

She said: 'We have known each other since 2011, when he started interviewing me.

'He's always given me quite a tough time, as he's a robust interviewer.

'I always enjoyed it because there was always a lot of banter.

'I like the fact that we don't agree and if I ever get too Tory-Tory, he'll bash me. 'He'll dissect my arguments, and I enjoy being challenged.'

Leslie, who was once voted the seventh sexiest woman in politics, added: 'My parents always said you could tell we got on well on air. He came for tea and that was it.'

The pair first met outside work after discovering they had both lived in the same home as children.

Mr Darvall, who has interviewed her several times since she won her seat in 2010 hosts BBC Radio Bristol's current affairs show.

Despite Darvall's passion for political debate, now that he's fallen for an MP he won't be able to present his show during the election period owing to the conflict of interests.

From next month he will be moving from the mid-morning slot to present the station's Afternoon Show until after the General Election.

A BBC Bristol spokesperson said: 'We have every confidence in the professionalism and impartiality of all our presenters and staff but given the heightened sensitivities of an election period, this arrangement is to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest.'
