Proud father Anthony O'Grady never got to walk his daughter down the aisle after he drank so much at her engagement party that he died, an inquest heard.

The 53-year-old warehouse manager was not a heavy drinker but on the night of his daughter Siobhan's bash he had at least six pints of Stella Artois.

He managed to get a taxi home from the celebrations in the early hours of the morning, but he fell off a small wall close to his house.

Tragedy: A taxi driver dropped Mr O'Grady to his house in Herbert Road, High Wycombe, but rather than going straight indoors he sat on a low wall, from which he fell and later died

His body was found in a bush in a front garden by a horrified neighbour the next evening.

Home Office pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said Mr O'Grady died of acute alcohol intoxication. The level of alcohol in his blood was recorded at 368mg alcohol per 100ml. Dr Hunt said anything above 350mg could lead to death.

He added that Mr O'Grady may have fallen into an unnatural position, causing 'postural asphyxia'.

The inquest heard that Mr O'Grady had attended the party at the Glass House pub, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, with other family members and friends.

Mr O’Grady, who was married but separated from his wife Penny, arrived at 9pm on Saturday 8 October and left in the early hours of the following morning.

Party: Mr O'Grady, who the coroner heard rarely drank to excess, apparently drank at least six pints of Stella during the party at the Glass House, which has since been renamed

Coroner Richard Hulett was told that Mr O'Grady managed to get a taxi to his home address in nearby Herbert Road but had sat down on a small wall after paying the driver.

Mr Hulett said he appeared to have 'toppled' off the wall backwards into a bush in a communal garden, and lay there unconscious until he died.

Mr O'Grady's body was found the following evening by a neighbour, who initially thought it was a sack of dumped rubbish and was horrified to discover what it was.

Police launched an investigation and a post mortem was carried out by the Home Office, which is called in to investigate suspicious cases.

Detective Constable Holly Cannon, who investigated the death, told the inquest in High Wycombe: 'Mr O'Grady had been at his daughter's engagement party and his family reveal that he was there by 9pm and left at 1.20am.

'From CCTV images and what family members have told us he had drunk around six pints of Stella Artois.

'It is unknown what, if anything, he had drunk before leaving for the public house.

'He walked out of the public house onto the High Street and a taxi took Mr O'Grady home to Herbert Road and dropped him off,' she said.

'He had sat on a wall and dropped over backwards. The wall was not particularly high. He fell backwards and came into contact with sharp ends of twigs.

'That's why he wasn't found for some time - it was overgrown shrubbery in the front garden,' said the detective.

The inquest was told that Mr O'Grady would have a drink 'from time to time, but not to high levels except on social occasions.'

Dr Hunt discovered a puncture wound to Mr O’Grady’s neck which he said was consistent with falling on to sharp twigs, but he found no further injuries which suggested he had been attacked.

Mr Hulett, in recording a verdict of death by misadventure, said: 'It looks to me that on this occasion he had consumed a considerable amount of drink at the social occasion.

'He got home, almost home, by taxi and seems to have sat down on this wall. Due to the fact it was very late and he had had a lot to drink, he toppled over backwards.

'Dr Hunt, in his conclusion, refers to postural asphyxia, which means that when he fell down he was so intoxicated he became comatosed and stayed in that position and may not have breathed properly, which led to him dying there and then.' He said Mr O'Grady had been 'unlucky'. 

Mr O'Grady's sister, Anne-Marie, said after the inquest: 'He was a lovely man, salt of the earth. He was well liked by everybody. His family was very close to him.

'It was such a happy occasion but ended in such tragedy.'
