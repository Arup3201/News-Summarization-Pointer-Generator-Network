The Kinks frontman Ray Davies is mourning the death of two of his sisters in the space of just three weeks.

The news of the death of his sister Rosie - who was the subject of one of the band's hits - was posted on the 70-year-old singer's official Facebook page.

It comes just weeks after the singer missed his induction into the 
Songwriters Hall of Fame in New York after the death of his sister Joyce.

Kinks frontman Ray Davies, 70, has lost a second sister in the space of three weeks after the death of his sibling Rosie

On the Facebook post it said: 'Ray has sadly just lost his sister Rosie yesterday. Our thoughts are with him and his family.'

Ray's sister Rosie was the subject of the band's 1996 hit 'Rosie won't you please come home'. It is about her moving to Australia with her husband.

Ray - who is the second to youngest of eight siblings - once said in an interview that he also called Rosie 'Mum' until he was aged five.

According to the Express, a friend who saw him near his home in Highgate, north London, said: 'Ray looked very frail and weak. He is clearly devastated by these tragedies so close together.'

After the death of his sister Joyce last month, Ray gave an acceptance speech via videolink at the induction saying: 'I am profoundly honoured and disappointed not to have been at the event but I felt it necessary to be with my family at this sad time of my sister’s funeral.'

Ray also lost his oldest sister Irene, or 'Rene', on his 13th birthday. She died of a heart attack just hours after giving him a life-changing birthday present – his first electric guitar.

The Kinks was formed in Muswell Hill, north London, by Ray and his brother Dave Davies in 1963. Their first
 major hit, You Really Got Me, came along only a year later. 

The band went on to become one of the most 
influential rock groups of a generation and influenced countless other 
British bands, including Oasis and Blur.

They went on to write and record dozens of hits, most famously Lola and Waterloo Sunset.

In 1990, the four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band separated in 1996, due to the creative tension between Ray and Dave and their declining commercial success.

During their decades as a band, the two 
brothers were known for their bickering and dust-ups, reportedly 
including fights on stage.

In recent months, there was speculation the band could reform and just last month Ray revealed the band may record and tour together once again.

Although Dave rubbished reports of a reunion only a few years ago, Ray claims he has spoken to his brother recently about a possible reunion and said he wants to write music with him again.
