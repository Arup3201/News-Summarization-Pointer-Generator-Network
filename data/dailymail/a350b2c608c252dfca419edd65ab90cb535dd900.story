The family of one of the two teenage students who died after falling 60ft from a luxury apartment block balcony have visited the scene of the tragedy.

Mexican Miguel Ramos, 18, and 19-year-old Anastasia Tutik were in a clinch when they lost their balance during a party in Depford, South East London, to mark the end of exams.

Today Miguel's grieving father Miguel Lozano Munguia was among family members who visited the scene.

'Tragic accident': Anastasia Tutik, 19, fell from a sixth-floor balcony with 18-year-old identified as Miguel Ramos, right, shortly after midnight in Deptford, south east London. They were believed to be at a party

He is the former mayor of the town of 
Pesqueria in Mexico and was once head of the centre-left Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the state of Nueva Leon.

The family arrived at the block, Knights Tower, around midday.

They were escorted by a driver employed by the college and were greeted by another teenage Mexican boy. He was thought to be Alfonso, a friend of Miguel's who was at the party.

The pair were celebrating at a luxury 
apartment with fellow students 
from Bellerbys College, an international school which charges fees of up
 to £21,000 a year.

Witnesses described hearing a huge bang in the early hours.

Samson
 Oguntayo, 32, who lives in a neighbouring block, said: ‘They were 
trying to have sex on the balcony. The guy was lifting the girl and 
putting her on the bannister, he kept on doing it.

‘You could see they were doing some really dangerous stuff.

‘At
 some point friends must have come outside and they got down and came 
back inside and then came back out again. They started doing it again.

‘You
 see people on the balcony doing all sorts of things and I just felt 
they will probably go back inside. The last thing I expected was to see 
them falling down. We just screamed.’

Mr Oguntayo said he ran to the scene and discovered both teenagers lying dead in a pool of blood on a stone patio.

He dialled 999 but paramedics could do nothing to save either teenager. Witnesses said the pair’s friends were hysterical.

Shradha
 Chaturvedi, 31, who lives on the second floor of the block, said: ‘I 
heard a very, very loud noise and a lady screaming.

‘Initially
 I heard a boom and at first I thought a firework had gone off or 
something. My husband came down and there were two guys outside who were
 totally drunk.’

Alfonso, a 
fellow student from Mexico, said Miguel arrived in London a week ago. 
‘They met at the party,’ he added. ‘He liked her and she liked him so 
they went on to the balcony to make out – to kiss and cuddle. They were 
alone on the balcony.

‘Miguel had come to London to take a summer course in English. He was from Monterrey and he wanted to study business.

‘Anastasia
 was very pretty – slim, blonde with green eyes – but she was very 
intelligent as well. She was one of the top students in the class.

‘She
 was studying A-levels and she was hoping to go to university in 
September. Miguel’s family are devastated. His parents are flying over 
from Mexico. They will arrive tomorrow morning.’

Anastasia’s
 parents, who live in Russia, are believed to be flying into London 
today. Bouquets of flowers have been placed at the foot of Knights 
Tower, which has spectacular views of the Thames and Canary Wharf.

Detective Chief Inspector Helen Millichap, of the Metropolitan Police Service, said: ‘We believe this was a tragic accident.’

Bellerbys hosts up to 300 international students who study A-levels, foundation courses and other qualifications.

Principal
 Paul McGregor said: ‘We are supporting the families of the deceased 
through this very difficult time. Counselling services are available to 
all students and staff at the college.’

Earlier
 this year, 17-year-old Russian student Polina Artomonova died in her 
room at Bellerbys in Greenwich, reportedly after taking drink and drugs.
