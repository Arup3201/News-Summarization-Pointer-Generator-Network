A talented French designer has created an amazing table that also doubles as a home for your pet canaries.

The Cage Archibird, now on display at the Galerie Gosserez in Paris, was created by Grégoire de Lafforest, who told Design Milk that it was designed to 'break convention'.

He added: 'The idea was to develop a cage as break from conventional codes and ensure the integration of a habitat as if in a mixing bowl. 

Theatrical: The Cage Archibald is intended to bring a sense of the theatrical to table design

No need for flowers! The Cage Archibird has tabletop decoration covered thanks to its bell jars

'The connection between the cage and glass bells refers to the stuffed birds who live there, as well as a nod to cabinets of curiosities.

'The bird cages are designed to look like glass bells as a nod to the idea of stuffed birds or taxidermy.'

He went on: 'The bird is staged as if in a theatre. It gives the traditional table a theatrical aspect and is an homage to curiosity cabinets.'

The table itself consists of a sleekly modernist pine top, with a delicate white-painted cage beneath and three glass bells on top.

Curiosities: According to Grégoire de Lafforest, the design was inspired by nature and curiosity cabinets

Inside the cage are three stuffed orange
 birds, although there's nothing to stop buyers from introducing real 
ones - provided they aren't worried about the mess.

The stunning photos of the Cage Archibird were shot by Jérome Galland, an up-and-coming photographer who specialises in design.

Lafforest, who adds on his website that the table represents an 'idealised vision of nature' is no stranger to work that pushes the boundaries.

Other striking efforts include the Bibliothèque Tolbiac, a bookcase designed to resemble a set of stairs and Lampe Olab, a stunning blown glass and steel lamp that looks like a tiny hot air balloon.

Another interesting piece is the Tabouret Montaigne, a delicate leather stool that resembles an upended thimble.
