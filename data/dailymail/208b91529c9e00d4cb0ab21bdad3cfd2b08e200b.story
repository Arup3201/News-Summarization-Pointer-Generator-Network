Went bowling: Dr. Craig Spencer went bowling in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn Wednesday and a day later was diagnosed with Ebola

Spencer went bowling at The Gutter in Williamsburg (pictured) while feeling 'fatigued' but before his fever began

Dr Craig Spencer rode the subway along with visiting a Brooklyn bowling alley, The Gutter, and the High Line park. It was revealed today that he had also eaten at The Meatball Shop in Greenwich Village and stopped at Blue Bottle Coffee on the High Line on Tuesday

Health officials Thursday night maintained that Spencer, 33, was not contagious before his fever started on Thursday morning. 

However, they've identified people who he was around on Wednesday or before as individuals who could be at risk.

New Yorkers, concerned America's largest and densest city has been put at risk, are venting online.

'ABSOLUTELY NO SYMPATHY for a doctor who knows he's been in contact w/Ebola, goes bowling, takes 2 subways, has contact with girl, Uber. none,' tweeted @ericbolling, an example of the many angry responses to Spencer's decision to head to The Gutter in Williamsburg on Wednesday night.

Cynical jokes about Ebola appearing in New York City also surfaced. 

Reactions to Spencer's decision to go bowling Wednesday ranged from anger to confusion to cynical jokes

Health officials say New York is safe, but the fact that Spencer is a doctor and still wasn't cautious enough to wait 21 days before spending time in crowds after dealing directly with Ebola patients has people worried

'How did you get Ebola?' began a joke from @ianpatrickhines. 'You rented some bowling shoes on Wednesday night and had a scratch on your toe? That's back luck, man.'

Ebola can only be transmitted through a sick person's bodily fluids, including sweat, saliva and vomit.

Many online posters about Dr Spencer referred to him choosing Williamsburg, a neighborhood frequented by hipsters and other trend-starters, for his night out.

Great,' tweeted @senorwinces. 'Now all the hipsters in Williamsburg get to brag about how they got Ebola before everyone else.'

Cynical jokes were a popular way Twitter users used to cope with Ebola's appearance in New York

User @lisavikingstad seconded the joke: 'Ebola was in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Seen dragging ppl to a friend's band & wearing thick rimmed glasses though its eyesight is FINE.'

Dr Spencer, who had been working with nonprofit organisation Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, returned to the US on October 17. He reported to doctors on Thursday morning as having a 100.3-degree fever and diarrhea. He was quickly taken to an isolation ward at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, a designated Ebola center.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will do a further test to confirm the initial results, has dispatched an Ebola response team to New York, and the city's disease detectives have been tracing Spencer's contacts to identify anyone who may be at risk. The city's health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said Spencer's fiancee and two friends had been quarantined but showed no symptoms.

In the days before Spencer fell ill, he went on a 3-mile jog, went to the High Line park, rode the subway and, on Wednesday night, got a taxi to a Brooklyn bowling alley. Bassett said he felt fatigued Wednesday but not feverish until Thursday morning.
