A little pony with a whole lot of pride in his appearance was a star attraction at the Horse of the Year Show this week.

Eight-year-old Luma the Lion, who was groomed to perfection to bring out his wild side, performed in a special display to celebrate the show's 65th anniversary in Birmingham.

Creatively disguised as a lion, Luma combines light comedy with liberty work and dressage movements in his performances, alongside trainer Melie Philippot.

The pair have worked on their act since Luma was three-years old, and disguised as the king of the jungle, Luma has become a big star on the continent appearing at major shows and events.

Speaking ahead of Luma's appearance, Helana Pettit of Grandstand Media, who booked the act for the show, said: 'We're delighted to have Melie and Luma joining us this year.

This is Luma and trainer Melie Philippot's first performance in the UK. Around 60,000 visitors are expected to attend the Horse of the Year Show, which is in its 65th year

'We certain Luma's wonderful personality will shine through in the expanse and bright lights of the Andrews Bowen International Arena, and his diminutive size will be no obstacle to entertaining everyone in the 9,500-strong audience.'

Luma's routine is a mix of dressage and liberty work. Around 9,500 people watched the pair put on their dazzling display

60,000 people are expected to visit the Horse of the Year show this week, and 1,600 horses will compete in the run up to Sunday's grand finale.

The event, which has special significance because of the show's 65th anniversary, will feature Brian Blessed, who will recite Ode To The Horse, the traditional poem which has been recited at every Horse Of The Year Show since 1954.

The spectacular performance is Luma and Miss Philippot's first in the UK, and combines a sense of humour with a high level of horsemanship

The Military Wives Choir will also appear at the finale to sing a rousing renditions of the National Anthem and Auld Lang Syne.

Luma's athletic ability allows him to do a range of tricks, including jumping through hoops and walking on two legs

Luma looks to be having lots of fun as he and trainer Melie Philippot entertain the crowd at the Horse of the Year show
