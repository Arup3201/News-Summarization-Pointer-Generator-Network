You can’t take the city out of the boy and, as far as Carl Frampton is concerned, you can’t take the boy out of the city either.

The rising cross-over star of the British ring — from Ulster idolatry to appreciation on mainland UK, from the hardcore boxing audience to multi-million viewership on mainstream terrestrial television — is so grounded in Belfast that he is considering back-tracking on his recent move with his young family to a farmhouse outside his home town.

‘It’s a bit of a handsome place but when we look out of the window across the fields there’s not another house to be seen,’ he says.

Frampton will defend his IBF super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos in Belfast a week on Saturday

Frampton says he was easily picked on in the streets because he was 'short, small and had big ears' 

They call ‘yer man Carl’ The Jackal but this is an urban animal: ‘I’m a Belfast lad to my bones.’

Frampton is talking as he prepares to headline the return of boxing to our major broadcast networks, ITV having picked him as the exciting reason for turning back to the sport for the first time in the best part of a decade.

He defends his IBF super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos, a typically tough Mexican-American, on Saturday week in Belfast’s Odyssey Arena, which has become a steaming cauldron for his exploits.

Satellite transmission from Belfast will be beamed live not only across the Irish Sea but also to another 54 countries, the US included.

Frampton’s fame will grow worldwide if, as expected, he comes through this mandatory commitment and moves on to world championship unification battles with Bury’s Scott Quigg in Manchester, and then Cuban sensation Guillermo Rigondeaux in America.

But no matter how much success he enjoys, it will be the same unspoiled young man who will celebrate by going out for a pint with his pals.

Frampton greatly admires Floyd Mayweather as the best pound-for-pound boxer on earth but says: ‘You won’t see me buying a fleet of Bentleys or a private plane. I’ll never change, famous or not. I’ll never be too big for my boots. For one thing, my wife wouldn’t let me. Nor would Belfast, where being flash quickly gets you disliked. I enjoy my friends. A lot of them go back to schooldays. We’re all working-class boys. Not many yuppies there.

‘The tough neighbourhood I come from is a big part of what has made me a world champion. The first punch I threw was probably at my brother, Craig, when we were kids. I had my first sparring session in the gym when I was seven.

Frampton says that his upbringing in a tough neighbourhood has contributed to his mentality and success

‘I had to learn how to handle bigger guys. I was easily picked on in the streets because I was short, small and had these big ears.’

That Tiger’s Bay area of Belfast is a hardline Protestant stronghold and Frampton grew up within the bullet-holed walls left behind by the Troubles. He knows that had he not punched his way out he could have gone the wrong way. ‘In a place like that it’s all too easy to do one stupid thing when you’re drunk, make that one mistake which puts you the wrong side of the law.’

Not to mention fall prey to prejudice.

In a mirror image of his manager and mentor, legendary ex-world champion Barry McGuigan, Frampton is helping heal that sectarian divide. McGuigan, a Catholic, married a Protestant. Frampton’s bride Christine is Catholic. Fighter and manager have harnessed the two communities, rallying them into a united body of support whenever they climb through the ropes.

Such defiance of historic enmities requires the kind of courage demanded of any man entering the professional ring but Frampton defers to McGuigan. He says: ‘Barry was fearless. Had to be, back then. It’s easier for me, Belfast is a better place now. There are more mixed marriages.’

Frampton is crossing boxing’s social divide, too. He says: ‘One of the pleasures for me is that not only are there are folk of all persuasions among my fans but wives and girlfriends insist on the men taking them to the fights. Many of them bring the kids too.’

That was evident when Frampton beat Kiko Martinez to win his world title in a 20,000-seat pop-up arena erected in the dramatic setting of the Titanic shipbuilding yards. But it is within the enclosed, reverberating, 9,000-ticket confines of the Odyssey that his support is at its most deafening.

Frampton takes justifiable pride in saying: ‘Honestly, this is the biggest atmosphere for any sporting event in Ireland now — the rugby, hurling and Gaelic football included.’

The frenzy will be cranked up by America’s ‘Let’s get ready to rumble’ ring announcer Michael Buffer, and London’s former world heavyweight champion David Haye is flying to join the party as one of ITV’s commentators.

There are loud echoes here of the old King’s Hall in which McGuigan fought his way towards featherweight glory.

McGuigan expects his protege to surpass his own achievements, saying: ‘Carl now has the physical strength, the punching power, the speed and the brain to become one of the greatest Irish boxers of all time.’ The full package is cemented by the work ethic which McGuigan impressed upon Frampton as being vital to any plan for conquering the world.

‘The point came when I realised I had to improve my attitude,’ Frampton confesses. ‘I had to get real serious about boxing. Luckily I love the sparring. Not all boxers do but it’s my favourite part of training. The running and some of the other stuff can be boring but I like nothing better than practising what I do.’

More than a hundred rounds of sparring have gone into preparing him to meet Avalos. Most of them against bigger, heavier men. Many, unusually, without the protection of a full headguard, about which he says: ‘I don’t feel comfortable in the crash helmet.’

This core toughness of the natural-born fighter is drawn from his upbringing, so much so that he does not regard the hardest game as especially rigorous. ‘If boxing and me hadn’t found each other I might have been out on the oil rigs, going to war in the army, maybe in a gang.

‘I’m lucky. I’ve never had to think about any other job. If I had, who knows what would have become of me?

The 27-year-old says promoter McGuigan was fearless back in Belfast but it is now easier for him

‘I’m grateful to boxing. So if me getting on to mainstream television proves to be good for the sport, that’ll be great.’ 

We are in the gym in south London where a wall has been decorated in boxing idiom by a Portuguese artist who paints murals with his hands.

There is enough space for a ring and a minimum of necessary equipment but they are moving to larger premises soon, as the stable presided over by McGuigan and his son Shane, Frampton’s trainer, keeps growing.

There is room at the moment for a sauna in which Frampton catches up with his family on a mobile phone while sweating out a head cold so that he can resume sparring. 

His weight is never an issue since he is rarely, if ever, more than a few pounds over the super-bantamweight  8st 10lb limit. 

Nor does he take any opponent lightly. ‘Quigg keeps calling me out, and maybe we will do that next, but I expect Avalos to be a harder fight. And although Rigondeaux is the best in the world I want him sooner rather than later.’

The latter of those fights could be built into a blockbuster in Las Vegas, New York or Miami but Frampton does not want that process to take too long.

He celebrates his 28th birthday on Saturday and says: ‘Unlike some boxers (such as the 50-year-old Bernard Hopkins) I don’t intend to go on fighting for ever. We want enough to live comfortably but lots of money is not on my agenda.

‘Nor is celebrity. My ambitions are all professional. I would like to become the undisputed world champion, then go up to win titles in at least one more division. I hope that would carry me into the boxing Hall of Fame.

‘Then it would be time to repay my wife for putting my career before her own. Time for me to take over looking after our daughters so she can go back to work.’

Christine is a lawyer and was embarking on a career in criminal justice before marrying Carl and giving birth to Carla, now four, and nine-month-old Rossa.

Before Frampton quits the ring he will put it to his wife that moving the family back into the city might be more convenient for her to resume her profession.

Once the Belfast boy, always the Belfast boy.
