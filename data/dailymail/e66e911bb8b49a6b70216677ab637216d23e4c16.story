Bored of snippy concierges, pokey rooms and no parking? Perhaps it’s time to book into a palace.

As upkeep costs spiral and monarchies dwindle, authorities are  looking for inventive ways to make use of stately piles.

The latest palace to be turned into a hotel is The Schobrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. It’s been operating as a museum since the 1950s, but is  inviting tourists to stay in the former suite of Emperor Franz Joseph, from £1,022 (€1,398) per night for four people (£255 (€350) a night per person).
