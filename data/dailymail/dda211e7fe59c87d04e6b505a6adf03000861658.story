Investigated: Ledford High School drama teacher Bob Dye was suspended with pay for handing out a survey to his students containing racy questions

A high school teacher in Thomasville, North Carolina, has found himself in hot water after parents said he handed out a survey to students on the first day of class asking them racy questions about their sex life.

Ledford High School drama teacher Bob Dye wrote the two-page, 50-question survey for a theater arts class which included a section under the heading ‘sex.’   

Parent Mike Shore said he was outraged when his 15-year-old daughter brought the questionnaire home from school this week.

‘I’m just super paranoid about stuff like that,’ Shore told WGHP.

The parent explained that his daughter was reading the questions out loud while going over the survey when he heard something that piqued his interest.

The two-page survey starts out with innocuous questions like ‘Do you consider yourself and extrovert or introvert?’ But towards the end of the questionnaire comes the five-question section labelled ‘sex.’

Among the racy questions the students were asked to answer were: ‘What form of seduction do you like the most?’ and ‘What's the most sensual or sexual part about you?’

Veteran teacher: Dye has worked at Ledford High School in Thomasville, North Carolina, since 2005 and headed a youth summer theater program

Risque: Students at Mr Dye's theater arts class came home on the first day of school with a two-page survey which included a section labeled 'sex'

Misunderstanding: A member of a Facebook group created in support of Dye said that the teacher said that students were not obligated to answer the sex questions

Shore said that the questions are just too personal to be asked in any class, even sexual education.

‘I just really didn’t think these were appropriate questions for a child to be answering,’ he said, adding that if he were to ask a child on the street something of that nature, he would be either shot or hauled off to jail.

Concerned dad: Mike Shore said he was outraged when he discovered that the survey his 15-year-old daughter received from her teacher contained personal questions about sex

Davidson County School District Public Information Director Donna Stafford told the Daily Mail in a phone interview on Thursday that Dye has been suspended with pay beginning August 29 for the purpose of an investigation.

Dye, 58, has worked at Ledford since August of 2005, according to the school district spokesperson.

Beside teaching drama at the school, Dye is also the director of the Davidson County Youth Summer Theater Program, which has staged student productions of Godspell, Disney's The Jungle Boo, and the Wizard of Oz.

Since his suspension, parents and students created a Facebook group in support of the popular teacher called Team Dye. Members of the online community called the 58-year-old man a role model and an inspiring figure.

Some commenters on the page have blamed the 15-year-old student for taking the survey out of context and going to the media. 

One person went further, saying that the girl fell asleep in class and therefore did not hear that Dye told the students that they were not obligated to answer the sex-related questions.   

It remains unknown how many students were given the survey. Shore said his daughter dropped the class after the first day.
