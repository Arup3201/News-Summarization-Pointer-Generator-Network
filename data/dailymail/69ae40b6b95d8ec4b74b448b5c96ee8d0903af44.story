Sharon Sutton died in February of the little known but deadly condition known as sepsis

Electrical supervisor Michael Sutton had never heard of sepsis when he lost his wife Sharon after a month-long battle with the condition in hospital.

The medical receptionist was taken to hospital with an unknown condition in February this year. 

After being wrongly diagnosed with gastroenteritis and treated with a broad range of antibiotics, Sharon was found to have Acute Myeloid Leukemia. 

The chemotherapy was so effective that it not only eradicated Sharon's cancer but killed off all her white blood cells, leaving her with no immune system.

After contracting an infection in hospital, the sepsis set in, shutting down the organs in her body. Four days after finishing chemotherapy, Sharon passed away.  

'I thought she had died of the cancer, but it was only when I looked at the cause of death on her death certificate that it said sepsis,' said Mr. Sutton. 

'The doctors mentioned it but I'd never heard of it, and they didn't tell me anything about it,' Mr. Sutton told Daily Mail Australia. 

Often referred to as septisaemia, sepsis can lead to shock, failure of multiple organs, and death if not recognised and treated properly.

The little known but life-threatening condition occurs when a patient's response to infection damages their organs and tissues. 

Over 30,000 Australians contract sepsis every year, with a quarter of those dying in hospital. 

Critical care researcher Professor Simon Finfer, of The George Institute for Global Health and The University of Sydney said that the numbers are probably higher, but are misdiagnosed or unreported.

These statistics come less than a week after the death of an Iranian asylum seeker in detention from the condition, raising alarm bells for many in the medical community.

'Sepsis is the leading cause of death from infection around the world and contributes to or causes between a third and a half of all deaths occurring in hospitals in the USA,' said Professor Finfer.

'Despite advances in modern medicine like vaccines, antibiotics, and acute care, millions of people around the world die of sepsis every year'.

This warning has been echoed by healthcare professionals for years, with little community awareness.

'Sepsis kills more people than HIV, prostate cancer, and breast cancer combined,' said Mr. Sutton.

'I got on the internet and did some research and found that there were no support groups in Australia for those suffering from sepsis, or those who had friends or family suffering from the condition,'

'There was no support here for people like myself to understand what sepsis is,'

'There was a leukemia foundation and and I was able to talk to people about leukaemia, and most importantly, get support, but there was no one for me to talk to about sepsis,' 

There were groups in the UK and the US, so I thought I would do something about it to raise awareness of sepsis in the community,'

'Sharon probably contracted the infection whilst in hospital,' said Mr Sutton. 'That's how most cases of sepsis are caused,'

'I'd love to see better hygiene standards within our hospitals, and to educate doctors and nurses about how to recognise it. If it can be picked up within an hour, it increases survival rate by 8%.'

The Australian Sepsis Network is the answer to Mr. Sutton's call. 

The Network, which launches its website today, is a new alliance of health care professionals who are pushing for greater education and earlier intervention to combat the increasing threat of sepsis in Australia. 

'Common symptoms of sepsis are fever, chills, rapid breathing and heart rate, rash, confusion and disorientation,' said Professor Finfer.

'Many of these symptoms, such as fever and difficulty breathing, mimic other conditions, making sepsis hard to diagnose in its early stages,'

'People are often told they have pneumonia or an infected gall bladder where the real issue is that they have sepsis, which is often contracted during or after surgery.' 

Professor Finfer and the Australian Sepsis Network are passionate about increasing healthcare standards to avoid further cases such as Sharon's. 

'Because sepsis occurs both in the community and in patients who are already in hospital our campaign will target increasing awareness in the community and also further increasing awareness amongst healthcare workers,' said Professor Finfer.

'In particular we must ensure that sepsis is treated as a medical emergency in the same way that a heart attack or stroke is.'

The Clinical Excellence Commission launched an initiative called SEPSIS KILLS in 2011, which has already had a positive impact on over 180 hospitals across Australia. 

September 13 is World Sepsis Day and is an initiative of the Global Sepsis Alliance (GSA) to promote sepsis awareness internationally. 

Information on global World Sepsis Day initiatives is available on their website.
