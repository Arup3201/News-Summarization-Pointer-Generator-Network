The suspected boyfriend of a bank manager who reported being held hostage by two mystery men before forced to rob her own bank has been arrested and charged with robbery and conspiracy.

Ray Vega, 33, has been released on $100,000 bail after arrested a day after the September 5th heist in Los Angeles, California that emptied the Bank of America safe with the manager's help.

The bank manager, identified as 32-year-old mother Aurora Barrera, maintains her claims of having not known her abductors who she described as two black men in masks.

According to KTLA, there are unconfirmed reports about Ms Barrera's romantic link to Vega.

Ms Barrera told police last week she was abducted from her home around 8.30am in Huntington Park and strapped with a sinister-looking device the men claimed was an explosive.

Vega, a former U.S. marine according to KTLA, is being charged at the state rather than federal level.

Armed with guns and wearing ski masks, the robbers raided the South Atlantic Boulevard branch with the woman.

The men, who police at the time suspected knew the manager, then forced the woman to order her fellow employees to remove the cash from the bank before throwing it to the heisters waiting outside the building.

'She was told that it was explosives 
and she was ordered to go into the bank and take out all the money,' 
said sheriff's Captain Mike Parker.

Parker said the manager entered the safe and the men got away with 'a decent amount' of money.

'She did do that in fear for her life,' he added.

The bank robbers took off in a two-door white Kia with partial license plates 6HOR54. Vega's arrest last week was the first in the investigation, according to police.

The woman remained inside the bank until the Los Angeles County sheriff's bomb squad arrived and carefully removed the device from her body.

The bomb squad used a robot to blow up 
the so-called explosive, which police said appeared to be a 'pipe bomb' 
but investigators later determined was a dummy explosive.

'A device left on the bank employee's 
person was rendered safe by a Sheriff's bomb squad and further 
investigation is ongoing, to include search for suspects,' the FBI's LA 
office wrote in a statement.

Nearby businesses were evacuated for a number of hours as a precaution while the device was disabled.

The manager, who was described as frantic and crying, was being questioned by detectives.

Investigators are trying to determine if there were any video surveillance cameras that captured the incident.Â
