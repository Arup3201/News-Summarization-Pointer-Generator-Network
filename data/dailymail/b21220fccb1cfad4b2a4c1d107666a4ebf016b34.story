Unfortunately, there was not nearly as much action on the pitch in Lille as there had been in the French city’s main square earlier in the day.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez will be pleased enough that another away draw in the Europa League leaves his side top of Group H with two of their remaining three games at home.

But 7,000 travelling Evertonians had precious little to get excited about inside Stade Pierre-Mauroy after a tough 24 hours which saw some of them attacked by hooded hooligans and others tear-gassed by police.

Martinez blamed the heavy pitch for stopping the game coming to life, but equally the two young stars of the show also failed to shine.

Ross Barkley, on his European debut, was caught by an elbow, forcing him to play most of the first half with a head bandage before having stitches at half-time.

Likewise, Lille’s £10million striker Divock Origi, on loan from Liverpool and the likely long-term replacement for Mario Balotelli, showed flashes of promise but was generally well marshalled by Phil Jagielka. He did not look the immediate answer to Brendan Rodgers’ Anfield goalscoring problems.

Martinez was proud of the way his side tamed the 19-year-old. He said: ‘Origi is a talent. He has pace but he needs space to be at his best and we stopped his service, particularly the two centre backs.’ Martinez has been accused of being defensively naive so will take pleasure from grinding out draws in Krasnodar and Lille to go with the 4-1 home win over Wolfsburg, leaving Everton odds-on to reach the knockout stages.

Pre-match talk was of the police raid on the city-centre Grand Place during the afternoon, in which pepper spray and tear gas were used to disperse Everton fans.

One elderly supporter went to hospital with a head wound after being hit by a gas canister and English supporters said the police had been heavy-handed. On Wednesday night, a group of Everton fans were victims of an attack by a hooded gang in a local bar and two ended up in hospital with minor facial wounds.

Martinez spoke after the game of his ‘immense pride’ in seeing so many ‘Bluenoses’ at the game in France to support their team. ‘It has brought me closer to understanding what the club means,’ he said.

It was a shame his players were unable to repay their fans with a flowing performance. They had only two genuine chances. The first saw the ball bounce unkindly for Samuel Eto’o in the first half and then Aiden McGeady finished weakly when set up by substitute Romelu Lukaku. Lille, eighth in the French league but with the joint-best defensive record, had more chances but Origi shot wide after racing past Tony Hibbert and Leighton Baines.

‘I was pleased we put in a solid performance,’ said Martinez. ‘We had some opportunities, but not as many as I would like. So you’d have to say I am half-satisfied.’

Martinez said before the game that European football would help Barkley’s development by setting new tactical challenges for the midfielder.

It was an astute observation because this was not Barkley’s best showing in a blue shirt. In mitigation he suffered a nasty cut over his left eye in the first half. ‘It seems by an elbow or forearm,’ said Martinez. ‘I don’t think it was malicious but if the referee had seen it, the Lille player would have been punished.’

The game was so tight that a penalty appeal against Leighton Baines after 57 minutes caused a bit of afters when referee Manuel De Sousa turned it down.

Franck Beria remonstrated, much to the annoyance of Everton’s Steven Pienaar, and after other players joined the mini-melee both men were cautioned.

On Origi, Lille manager Rene Girard gave a curt 'No' when asked whether he could be fast-tracked at Anfield in January, but he promised Liverpool fans: ‘He is a great striker in the making. Tonight there wasn’t a lot of difference between him and the more experienced strikers Eto’o and Lukaku. Remember he is just 19 and needs experience, but I was happy with his performance.’
