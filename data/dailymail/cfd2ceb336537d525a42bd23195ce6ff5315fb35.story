The Government's razor gang has found another victim - the Australian War Memorials long-standing travelling exhibitions program.

The Australian War Memorial has been forced to end its popular travelling exhibitions program due to Budget cuts.

After 17 years of successful exhibitions, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs informed the Memorial that it will stop its funding of the travelling exhibition program, effective immediately.

In April next year Australians will commemorate 100 years since the first ANZAC landings at Gallipoli but unless a private backer is found, there is no plan to reinstate the historic travelling exhibitions. 

Part of the exhibitions are images form soldier and surgeon Sir Charles Ryan, who captured the Australians’ experience on Gallipoli in 1915 in a series of candid photographs. (Above) Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, May 1915. Two soldiers of the Supply Depot, 1st Australian Division, stand on the beach among boxes of corned beef. Rows of petrol and water held in cans are in the foreground. The War Memorial's caption for the photograph is:  'Here, in Ryan’s display of mateship, stoicism and dogged endurance, is the spirit of Anzac'.

'Remember Me' (above) from the The Lost Diggers of Vignacourt exhibition. This photograph from November 1918, shows locals and Australian soldiers gathering on the street prior to a march and commemoration ceremony at the Vignacourt cemetery, in France

This picture from Sir Ryan's collection was taken in May 1915. Officers and soldiers are pictured conferring in a trench reinforced with sandbags on one of the ridges at Gallipoli.

Captain Harry Hartley walks down the steps of the Church of Saint-Firmin, Vignacourt, with his new bride Simone Marie Pecourt, a local Vignacourt woman. He was a captain with the 1st Australian Division Supply Column. Cpt Hartley met Simone while he was stationed in the town. After the war they lived in Amiens, where they set up a tyre business. They had two children and stayed in Amiens until the German occupation of France in 1940. Cpt Hartley was killed during the evacuations.

The razor gang took $800,000 away from the War Memorial Exhibitions but at the same time the government spends more than $70 million on floor space for 2000 Defence Department employees, yet thousands of square metres remain empty.

This includes $330,000 spent on Immigration Minister Scott Morrison's new media room, which has been dubbed 'The Empty Room' because it is yet to be used. It even has a $800 door knob.

There was also more than $15,000 of taxpayer dollars were spent on a second custom-built bookcase for Attorney-General George Brandis because the old $7000 version was too big to fit in the Senator's new office.

The exhibitions touring this year include the popular 'Remember Me: The Lost Diggers of Vignacourt', which provides some amazing insights into the life of Australian soldiers behind the front lines of the Somme, through a collection of more than 800 black and white photographs.

This series of amazing images is now on show in Adelaide. The War Memorial has given Daily Mail Australia permission to display some of the priceless photographs for the benefit of readers who will now have to travel to Canberra to have any chance of viewing them.

War Memorial director Brendan Nelson said exhibitions have been taken to museums and galleries across Australia for almost two decades.

'In delivering travelling exhibitions to the Australian public, particularly in regional and rural areas, the Memorial has told the story of Australia’s military history with support of the Memorial’s extensive national collection,' Dr Nelson said.

Also missing in action now will be the likes of 'Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan' and 'A Camera on Gallipoli', which showcases photographs of the ANZACS drawn from private collections assembled during the Gallipoli campaign.

'The travelling exhibitions program has been delivered through supplementary funding of $800,000 a year,' Dr Nelson said.

Children and townspeople gather in the Vignacourt cemetery for a commemoration ceremony given by the mayor of Vignacourt. Care of the cemetery and graves was handed over to the local children. This is Vignacourt, France during the period 1916 to 1918.

'The Department will certainly not have found this an easy decision.

'As a result, the Memorial must cease the travelling exhibitions program. This will take effect immediately.

'We are very disappointed.'

All travelling exhibitions will return to the Memorial once they conclude at their current venues.

On average 200,000 Australians, many in regional areas, view the various exhibitions each year.

'The immediate future is that some of the travelling exhibitions will go on to their next venue or destination and then come back to the memorial,' Dr Nelson added.

He also hoped the funding cut would not lead to job losses.

'I want to keep the staff if I possibly can... we have six full-time staff,' he said.

'My priority is to do everything we can to look after them and I'm reasonably confident we'll be able to do that.'
