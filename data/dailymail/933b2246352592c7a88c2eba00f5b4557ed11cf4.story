A father-of-three discovered he was suffering with the early stages of skin cancer after he cut his face while shaving.

Stephen Hinchliffe, 59, from York, was urged by his wife to get checked after a razor nick failed to heal.

His GP immediately sent him for a biopsy which diagnosed the cancer and he has now made a full recovery.

Initially, Stephen wasn't concerned when he cut himself. But over several days his cut grew, became raised and changed colour. When his GP saw his face he ordered an immediate biopsy which revealed cancer

Stephen, who is married to Sue, 60, and has three daughters, Lauren, 31, Suzanne, 30 and Leah, 27, said: 'I was having a shave and nicked my skin.

'There was a slight cut and it bled but it wasn't anything unusual so I didn't think anything of it.

'I thought it would heal in a couple of days. I thought I'd just taken the top layer off my skin but over the course of a few days it started to change colour.'

The wound also started to change shape, grow bigger and become slightly raised.

'Although I thought it was unusual, I was just going to leave it and see if it healed over time. It was my wife who urged me to get it checked out.

I thought I would be wasting the doctors' time but Sue told me that it couldn't harm and it's best to know about these things.

Stephen had always worn sunscreen while holidaying abroad, but it was doing everyday activities like gardening that caught him out

Stephen, accounts manager for an international tyre company, was sent straight to York Hospital for further tests.

'I was given a biopsy at the hospital that very same day. No one seemed to know what was wrong so they took some cell samples from my cheek.'

Ten days later, when the results came back, Stephen was diagnosed with skin cancer. Doctors told him that he has a very thin melanoma which was around 1mm in depth.

Stephen went for an operation a few days after he was diagnosed, where 1cm of skin surrounding the cut was removed from his cheek.

Since the operation, Stephen has been given the all clear and now must attend a check-up every six months.

He said: 'They said it's less common than other skin cancers but it much more dangerous if it's not found early.

'They think it is likely that it was triggered by the sun.

'I was in complete shock when I heard the news. I thought the doctor was going to say it was nothing, maybe just an infection or something, and never expected anything like that.

'I am so grateful to my wife that she encouraged me to get checked. God only knows how long I would have waited if she hadn't said anything.

'The fact it was caught earlier means it was much easier to treat. I'm so happy that I've been given the all clear now but I know that, had it not been for cutting myself and Sue's persistence, things could have been a lot worse.'

He is now urging people to use sun tan cream and is backing a campaign by national charity Macmillan.

Stephen said: 'I tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they're outdoors - even when they're doing everyday things like gardening. It's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - I've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun'

Stephen said he had always been careful to wear sunscreen while holidaying abroad, but it was doing everyday activities like going out walking, gardening or playing sport when people can get caught out.

'I tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they're outdoors. It's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - I've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun.

'I've realised that you can't be too careful. UV rays are there all the time, even if it doesn't seem sunny.

'I hope that my experience can in some way help others and encourage people to take more care in the sun.'

The number of people diagnosed with malignant melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, in the UK is on the rise with 35 people diagnosed every day.

Carol Goodman, skin cancer nurse specialist on the Macmillan Support Line, said: 'Research shows that, despite being aware of the health risks, people are still burning themselves in the sun in order to get a tan.

'As we start to look forward to summer after one of the coldest winters yet, it is alarming that staying safe in the sun is not a priority for many people.

'Sunburn will cause serious damage to your skin which can lead to cancer. A diagnosis of malignant melanoma can be just as fatal as some other cancers.

'It is vital to protect your skin when out in the sun by using sun tan lotion, wearing sun protective clothing including hats and sunglasses or staying in the shade between the hours of 11am and 3pm."
