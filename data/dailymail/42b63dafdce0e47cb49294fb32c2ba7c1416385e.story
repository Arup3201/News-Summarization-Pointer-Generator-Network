It is hard to know who our real friends are sometimes in the fast-paced modern world of virtual friends and virtual social networks.

Now criminals are trying to blur the lines even further by posing as friends on the streets of Manchester so that they can take advantage of people who have been drinking to excess.

Greater Manchester Police have warned that criminals are targeting inebriated people on nights out and convincing them that they are their friends before mugging them.

The Manchester police have released CCTV footage of people falling victim to the so-called hugger-muggers as a result of excessive drinking.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, GMP’s lead on alcohol-related crime and disorder, said: 'People are more vulnerable to different types of crime when they are drunk.' 

Mr Shewan urged people to drink responsibly and to be vigilant when they are socialising

Distraction: Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said people are more vulnerable when they are drunk.

Mr Shewan said, 'To remind them to drink responsibly, we are circulating footage of hugger-muggers stealing phones from those who have let their guard down. 

The Assistant Chief Constable said by being more careful people could significantly reduce their chances of falling victim to crime.

Mr Shewan recommended that 'young people pace their drinks by mixing them with non-alcoholic rounds, stick with friends throughout the night, and keep to well-lit areas when going home, avoiding shortcuts such as alleyways and car-parks'.
