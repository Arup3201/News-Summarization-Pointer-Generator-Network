Police have smashed a suspected Russian prostitution gang run from luxury flats in Chelsea which generated up to £20,000 a day.

Six people have been arrested after Scotland Yard carried out dawn raids on 13 properties including a gated estate behind Chelsea FC's ground Stamford Bridge.

Nine Eastern European women, who police say were trafficked and forced into prostitution, were rescued and are now being looked after in care centres.

The racket, believed to have links to the Russian mafia, was run from a block of nine flats on 
Warwick Road in Chelsea which the group rented and operated as a brothel.

Women were 'recruited' from Eastern Europe and promised jobs in the leisure industry working in posts such as receptionists at hotels.

But once in the UK they were forced to work as prostitutes and told their families would be harmed if they refused.

Detectives also seized £75,000 in cash today from two of the suspects' addresses.

The suspected ringleader is a 44-year-old Russian brothel madam who was arrested at an address on the luxury Brompton Park Crescent estate in Chelsea.

Arrests were also made at several other luxury addresses in west London including Chelsea Harbour and a gated estate behind Stamford Bridge football ground.

Officers from Scotland Yard’s Human Trafficking and Prostitution Unit closed in on the gang after watching them for 12 weeks.

The gang were said to have operated a sophisticated operation which included advertising, a website, enforcers and an accountant.

Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland, of the Human Trafficking and Prostitution Unit, said: 'This was organised and run on the lines of a business with elements that arranged the recruitment in eastern Europe, the advertising and the website and the accounting.

'We have targeted an organised group of criminals who have been profiting from the abuse of scores of women.

'This operation is in part a result of victims having the courage to come forward about the abuse they are suffering. I urge other victims of trafficking to phone our hotline where we have translators and specially trained staff awaiting their call. '

Three of the Russian nationals were in the UK illegally.

Following the raids the nine women, from Russia, Bulgaria and Latvia, have been taken to a care centre to be looked after.

Five people were arrested on trafficking, controlling prostitution and money laundering offences.

These included two women from Chelsea, aged 44 and 33, a 31-year-old woman from Fulham, a 27-year-old man from Palmers Green and a 30-year-old woman from Palmers Green.

A sixth person - a 37 year-old man from Beckton - was also arrested in Essex.

All are currently in custody at a west London police station.
