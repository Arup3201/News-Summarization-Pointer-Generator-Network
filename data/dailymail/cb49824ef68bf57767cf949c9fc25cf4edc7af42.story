A mother broke down in court today as she described seeing her four-year-old daughter die in hospital after a doctor failed to administer the treatment she needed to save her life.

Carly Wells whispered 'goodbye baby' to her daughter Freya when the girl was being sedated by medics - but it turned out to be the last thing she would ever say to the girl, an inquest heard.

Just 25 minutes later, the four-year-old died from septic shock, covered in her own vomit, after a hospital registrar failed to administer intravenous antibiotics quickly enough.

West London Coroner's Court heard that registrar Dr Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics even though her junior colleague Hilary Towse and nurses at Kingston Hospital in Surrey disagreed.

Dr Towse told the hearing yesterday that Dr Ibrahim had made her cry by laughing at her suggestion that the girl's condition was more serious than the senior doctor thought.

Today the inquest into Freya's death on November 22 2012 was read a statement from Ms Wells, who claimed Dr Ibrahim 'didn't seem concerned' Freya had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days before being admitted to hospital.

Freya's mother took her to the her GP twice before taking her to A&E at 9pm on November 21 because she had been ill for five days and wasn't getting any better.

'I was very worried about Freya - it seemed her whole body moved when she took a breath, she would make a grunting noise and was wheezy,' Ms Wells said.

'I took Freya to Kingston Hospital straight away, I was with her the entire time except for less than a minute when she was put to sleep at 5.40am - I don't think I even went to the toilet because I wanted to stay with my little girl the entire time.

Freya Wells, 4, died at Kingston Hospital in Surrey (pictured) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method, a hearing was told

'The doctor didn't seemed concerned - at no point until the end did they give the impression that there was something very serious with Freya. They didn't tell me what was wrong or do anything with urgency.

'After an X-ray of her chest a nurse spoke to me and said Freya had a chest infection so would be kept overnight.

'Another doctor, called Dr Ibrahim, came along as well, she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with Freya either.

'I was worried because she was clearly unwell just to look at her. I remember Freya was given oral antibiotics in A&E and was sick again after taking the medication. My memory is a bit blurred after that - Freya was transferred to the children's ward.'

After Freya's grandmother, Shirley Parker, arrived on the ward, Ms Wells contacted her nurse sister as this was the 'main way to get information'.

She tried to get her daughter to sleep but she was 'clearly scared and wanted hugs' after vomiting and having diarrhoea in her hospital bed, the inquest heard.

West London Coroner's Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment

'Even when we were on the children's ward not a lot seemed to happen', she continued. 'Nothing made me panic until they said they would have to put Freya to sleep.

'As time past Freya seemed to get worse. I felt helpless because my little girl was crying and asking me to make things better. The doctors didn't seem to be doing anything.'

The inquest hearing had to be paused today after Ms Wells started weeping while her statement was read to the court.

Ms Wells said the first time a doctor told her anything was wrong was when Freya was put to sleep to help her breathe.

She added: 'There were lots of people everywhere - wires and tubes were attached to Freya, she was screaming, I had to hold her leg down because there were not enough people to do that.

'I remember kissing Freya saying "goodbye baby'". I didn't know it was the last thing I would ever say to her.

Dr Rosita Ibrahim, accused of making Freya's mother cry, is seen leaving West London Coroner's Court today

'When I was told my little girl had died, it felt like my whole world had died as well.'

The inquest heard that if septic 
shock is diagnosed immediately, there is a 95 per cent chance of 
survival, but the initial mortality rate of five per cent doubles each 
hour it is not detected and treated.

Dr
 Marilyn McDougall, a paediatric consultant who conducted an 
investigation into Freya's death, told the inquest that by the time 
doctors realised what was wrong her chances of survival were 'very, very
 slim'.

She said: 
'Freya was extremely tachycardic and in respiratory distress, which was 
in keeping with the diagnosis of septic shock. If this had been 
recognised earlier, her chances of survival would have been greatly 
improved.

'Survival for a diagnosis of septic shock is 95 per cent... by 6am, the chances of survival were very, very slim.'

The
 consultant told the inquest that Dr Ibrahim failed to recognise the 
'severity' of the youngster's condition, saying she would have expected a
 'more comprehensive assessment'.

However,
 she added that 'it was not obvious she was unwell', saying a 'thorough 
examination' is needed to establish a diagnosis of septic shock.Â 

The
 criminal charges could be brought if West London coroner Dr Sean 
Cummings concludes unlawful killing, as the Crown Prosecution Service 
would be notified and could prosecute.

Richard
 Baker, representing Freya's family, said: 'Unlawful killing might be an
 appropriate conclusion - that submission is not meant to be scandalous.

'There
 was a failure to appreciate the words from other doctors, a failure to 
obtain information that would be obtainable and a lack of justification 
and observation in this case.

'These features will take you beyond the usual medical failures to gross negligence.

'In
 terms of neglect, there was a failure to provide basic medical 
attention to a vulnerable person who is in a serious condition.

'Neglect is not negligence - a gross failure is not the same as gross negligence.'

However,
 Dr Ibrahim's representative Shaheen Rahman, argued against a verdict of
 unlawful killing because her client noticed the tragic youngster had an
 infection.

She said: 
'It is absolutely clear that the approach throughout this inquest hasn't
 been founded on suspicion. Nobody has been asked if this was a gross 
negligence kind of case.

'This
 wasn't a case where there was a failure to see if the patient was 
unwell. It was appreciated there was an infection and appreciated it was
 pneumonia.

Alarm: Junior doctor Hilary Towse repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment given to Freya

'Antibiotics were given, fluids, in fact extra fluids, were given.'

Cara Guthrie, representing Kingston Hospital NHS Trust, added: 'This is a desperately sad case and the Trust accepts the standard of care for Freya fell far short of what she should have had.

'To return a verdict of unlawful killing, you would have to be satisfied to the criminal standard and be sure beyond reasonable doubt.

'The Trust has taken extensive steps to learn from Freya's death and other steps to ensure no other child dies at Kingston Hospital in similar circumstances.'

The inquest also heard evidence from Dr Titilola Ayeni, who cried as she told the coroner she could not understand why hospital staff took so long to call her.

The consultant, who was finally called to examine Freya at 5am on November 22, 2012, said Freya was 'clearly, very ill' when she came to examine her and that despite her being by far the sickest patient on the ward that night, staff showed little urgency when briefing her.

'It's not a situation I've ever experienced before", she explained, "it wasn't complicated in my opinion, it was very simple, very basic.

'There was no urgency, no recognition that the situation was an emergency - it is what I call a meandering discussion.

'I thought calling the consultant was very appropriate because the child was so unwell.

'She had been the most ill patient on the ward so she should have been in the High Dependency Unit so we could have observed her more closely.'

The coroner is expected to deliver his verdict on Monday.

The inquest continues.
