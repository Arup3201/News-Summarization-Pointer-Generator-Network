We last knew her as a retired grandmother-of-eight, the surprise winner of The Great British Bake Off.

But it seems Nancy Birtwhistle has undergone a remarkable transformation in the months since her victory.

The 60-year-old – dubbed ‘Gadget Gran’ because of her ingenious home-made kitchen implements – showed off an unexpectedly glamorous side in a new glossy magazine photoshoot.

Nancy Birtwhistle, 60, (pictured) is a retired grandmother-of-eight and the surprise winner of The Great British Bake Off  - she has recently undergone a glossy makeover for a women's magazine interview

Posing for Woman & Home magazine, she revealed she has started paying more attention to her grooming after winning the BBC1 show, treating herself to professional blow dries, wearing false eyelashes and even engaging the services of a professional beautician.

And she said she ‘loves’ the attention her new-found fame has brought her so much she regularly stops in the street to have ‘selfies’ taken with her fans.

Mrs Birtwhistle’s new found confidence and glamour is a far cry from the unassuming character who won Bake Off just two months ago.

She said: ‘I don’t know what the definition of celebrity is, but I’ve loved life since winning Bake Off. I get to do glamorous photoshoots like this, talk at events, such as the Cake & Bake show, and I even get recognised in the street.

‘Some people just do a double take, while others will come over and say, “I know you from somewhere, I can’t think where it is.” 

Then there’s the avid Bake Off fans who know straight away and take selfies with me. It’s bizarre but great fun.’

Mrs Birtwhistle is a retired GP practice manager and lives with her husband Tim, 63, in Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire.

She admitted she has started paying more attention to her appearance since winning Bake Off, including wearing false eyelashes.

She said: ‘When they first put false eyelashes on me on Bake Off, I felt ridiculous but now I love them. 

'I’ve discovered you can get subtle individual lashes that are less obvious than the big things you wear on television, so now I have a beautician come round every three to four weeks and redo them.

‘It’s great because I don’t have to worry about wearing eye make-up anymore.’

Mrs Birtwhistle said she ‘hates’ shopping for clothes but is ‘addicted’ to scarves, with a collection of around 50 in her wardrobe.

Her husband – who made a kitchen implement out of a drainpipe that helped her construct her Bake Off showstopper – even made a special tie rack to hang them on.

And she now prefers to get her hair washed and dried professionally rather than do it herself.

She said: ‘I hate drying my hair so I rarely wash it myself.

'I go down to the local salon and treat myself to a blow-dry once a week instead. 

'That’s my one indulgence. Well, that and the false eyelashes.’

While she may be known for her skills in the kitchen, Mrs Birtwhistle said she has a surprising fondness for shop-bought, ready-made Chicken Kiev, which she eats with chips and salad.

And perhaps surprisingly for a woman her age, she is now hooked on Twitter. 

She said: ‘I joined just before Bake off went on air and I went from zero to more than 21,000 followers in a matter of weeks.

‘I used to think people spent too much time on their phones, but I can understand it now. 

'It’s highly addictive.’

Mrs Birtwhistle now hopes to bring out a cookery book and start a new career in baking.

She said: ‘I used to be Tim’s PA, so I’m enjoying having him as my helper now. 

'He’s been fielding all my phone calls, emails, letters and requests.

‘Women should have equal rights and equal pay, and I hate to see men trying to dominate women. 

'However, I do still believe in old-fashioned chivalry so I’m not sure I can call myself a true feminist. 

'I still want a man to give up his seat for me.’
