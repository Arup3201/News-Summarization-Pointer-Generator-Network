As North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un appears to finally be toning down the warlike rhetoric that has kept the region on edge for the past months, a U.S journalist has told how she was sentenced to 12 years hard labour in communist state.

Tensions escalated after North Korea put a satellite into space in December last year and conducted a nuclear test in February. The test triggered new U.N. sanctions, which led to a barrage of threats from Pyongyang.

North Korea reacted furiously to the two-month long joint exercises between the U.S. and South Korea which saw nuclear-capable stealth bombers used in drills close to the border.

Kim Jong Un was pictured rallying North Korean troops and conducting military drills and had threatened missile strikes against the south and the U.S.

But in recent days the young leader has been pictured attending sports events and visiting a health complex with his wife, signalling a break in tensions.  

Dongguk University professor Kim Yong-Hyun told the Australian Associated Press the North Korea could be waiting for the conclusion of talks between Barack Obama and South Korea's new leader Park Geun-Hye, scheduled to take place on May 7, before deciding on a new course of action.

He said: 'North Korea appears to be taking a breather after its brinkmanship reached fever pitch.

'North Korea wants some gestures from Obama. Then it may try to open dialogue with the United States as it did before.'

Korean-American Kenneth Bae was yesterday sentenced to 15 years 'compulsory labour'

Yesterday the communist state sentenced American citizen Kenneth Bae to 15 years of hard laborfor crimes against the state, prompting a U.S. call for his amnesty in hopes of avoiding him becoming a bargaining chip between the two countries.

Mr Bae, 44, was born in South Korea but is a naturalized U.S. citizen and studied psychology for two years at the University of Oregon.

In 2009 U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were captured after sneaking into North Korea from China in 2009 and sentenced to 12 years hard labour.

They were freed after serving 140 days in captivity after former U.S. president Bill Clinton flew to Pyongyang to appeal to the then leader Kim Jong Il for their release.

Speaking to CBS news Ling told of her ordeal and the brutal treatment she received at the hands of her captors.

Ling and Lee had crossed the frozen Tumen River, to enter North Korea, but had turned back almost immediately without venturing further into the country.

But North Korean border guards pursued them over the ice before capturing them on the Chinese side and dragging them back across the river into North Korea.

One of the guards knocked Ms Ling unconscious with the butt of his rifle and the next thing she recalls was waking up in captivity. 

Ling and Lee were kept apart and charged with illegal entry and hostile acts before being transferred to Pyongyang.

They were forced to confess to plotting to overthrow the North Korean government and following a secret trial were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor.

Ms Lee said cried out loud in the courtroom when her labor camp sentence was handed down.

She said: 'The word 'Labor camp" took the tiny hope I had away from me. I was physically and mentally weak and I really thought I would not make it home,'

The pair were held separately under guard but in what Ms Ling describes as a 'regular' rooms.  

There were frequent power cuts and water outages meant she was often forced to wash by boiling hot water in a kettle.

Contact with the outside world was limited however she managed to contact her sister, husband and parents and was also able to receive mail.

She passed the time by focusing on how she could escape and practisng yoga and meditation.

Ms Ling told CBS: 'I was never sent to one of the notorious labor camps.

'I was in a room that had a bed and a bathroom and an adjoining room that had two female guards.'

Ling and Lee were pardoned on humanitarian grounds and released to former President Clinton, who met with then-leader Kim Jong Il. U.S.-North Korea talks came later that year.

Like Ms Ling, it is likely Mr Bae will avoid being held in one of the state's forced labor camps.

Human rights groups say more than 200,000 people are incarcerated in these camps, where they are beaten and starved, sometimes to death.

Human rights activists in South Korea say Bae may have been arrested for taking pictures of starving children.

Kenneth Bae, pictured on a South Korean news broadcast, is at least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009

Bae is 'a committed Christian," said David Ross, director of a missionary training center at Antioch World Ministries Inc. in Monroe, Washington.

'He has feelings for orphans and has done some ministry work feeding orphans,' added Ross, who said he has been a casual acquaintance of Bae since they met four years ago through church  affiliations in Hawaii. 'He has a missionary heart,' Ross said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said any negotiations with North Korea are 'dependent upon the North Koreans demonstrating a willingness to live up to their international obligations.'

North Korea is the subject of U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for an end to its nuclear and missile tests, as well as punitive U.N. sanctions.

Some media reports have identified Bae as the leader of the tour group. NK News, a specialist North Korea news website, said he was the owner of a company called Nation Tours that specialized in tours of northeastern North Korea.

Bird flu precautions: An unmanned helicopter is used during precautionary quarantine measures in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea today over fears the H7N9 bird flu virus could spread from China

The reports could not be verified and North Korean state news agency KCNA did not list any specific charge other than crimes against the state, and used a Korean rendering of Bae's name, Pae  Jun-ho, when it reported the Supreme Court ruling.

'North Korea has shown their intention to use him as a negotiating card as they have done in the past,' said Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at the Sejong Institute, a think-tank in Seoul.

North Korea appears to use the release of high-profile American prisoners to extract a form of personal tribute, rather than for economic or diplomatic gain, often portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage.

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who has traveled to North Korea before to try to free a detained American, has no plans to do so for Bae, Carter's spokeswoman said.

According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is between five and 10 years hard labor.

South Korean officials are also on alert over fears the recent bird flu outbreak. The deadly H7N9 bird flu strain has broken out in China in recent weeks claiming at least 26 lives.

Unmanned helicopters were used to spray areas as part of quarantine measures at a bay in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province.
