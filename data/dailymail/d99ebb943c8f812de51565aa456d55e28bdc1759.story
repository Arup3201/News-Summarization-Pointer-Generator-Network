The mother of a 14-year-old boy from The Bronx who is accused of stabbing to death a  classmate has said that her son was acting in self-defense after suffering from months of merciless bullying that left him suicidal.

Noel Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab his former best friend, Timothy Crump, in the chest three times after school Wednesday.

Timothy was rushed to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Estevez has been charged as an adult with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter.

According to local reports, the two classmates had a falling out over a smartphone, which Estevez had borrowed from Crump but was unable to return.

On Saturday, Estevez's mother, Maria Estevez, 52, broke her silence for the first time since her son's arrest, telling the New York Daily News from behind bars that her child was afraid for his life.

'He was protecting himself. I saw him on the news. I saw his face,' said Mrs Estevez from her jail cell in Rikers Island, where she has been held since June 11 after she allegedly tried to sell crack cocaine to an undercover officer.

The mother blamed the victim, Timothy Crump, also 14 years old, for pushing her special-needs son over the edge.

Unable to take the relentless bullying anymore, in May Noel tried to take his own life, according to his mother. While recovering from the suicide attempt in the hospital, the 14-year-old was diagnosed with a bipolar disorder.

A week after Noel was released home he allegedly came to school armed with a knife for protection

When Crump jumped his former friend after classes let out, Estevez pulled out the knife and plunged it repeatedly into the other boy's chest, police said.

When questioned by investigators, Noel Estevez said he was retaliating against his tormentor, who attacked him without provocation.

According to Noel's 52-year-old 
mother, her son could not take the abuse, which ranged from homophobic
 name-calling to mean jokes about his speech impediment to urinating on 
the Estevez family’s front door.

‘[Noel] was saying, “They’ll kill me!”’ Maria Estevez recalled to the Daily News.

A
 teacher at Intermediate School 117, which both teens had attended, 
described Crump as 'a predator, a monster' and 'a bomb waiting to 
explode.'

On her part, Maria Estevez had 
some harsh words for officials at her son's school, saying that they did
 nothing to protect Noel from the abuse or help him transfer out.

Mrs Estevez recalled that her son was so scared of his nemesis that he took to opening the door armed with a knife.

Noel’s
 mother also said that case workers from the Administration for 
Children's Services ignored her concerns for her son's safety, which had led
 her to keep him home for a while, and ordered her to send him back to 
school.

During the 
jailhouse interview, Mrs Estevez also shed light on the fate of the 
iPhone that started a war between the two former friends, revealing that
 she shattered the device after learning that Crump had allegedly stolen
 it from someone during a violent mugging, and then let Estevez borrow 
it.

After Noel was unable 
to return the phone to Crump, the boy turned on his friend and 
classmate, launching a bullying campaign against him with other teens.

Mrs
 Estevez recalled that before their feud, the two 14-year-olds would 
often play basketball together and even have sleepovers. She added that 
she feels sorry for Crump's family.

Friends
 and neighbors said that Timothy accused Estevez of stealing his 
smartphone and that started a campaign of harassment and bullying that 
resulted in Estevez trying to kill himself.

Noel Estevez, who friends said suffered
from a speech impediment and Tourette’s syndrome, was terrified of Timothy and a group of his friends who took to chasing him down the 
street and leaving him too scared to leave his home.

Around 3pm Wednesday, as Intermediate School 117 on Morris Avenue in The Bronx was being let out, the argument between Estevez and Timothy Crump spilled over into bloodshed.

Witnesses said that they saw Timothy confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose.

Teachers and teaching assistants rushed to the scene to break up the brawl but before they could intervene, Estevez produced a 12-inch kitchen knife and plunged it into his former friend three times, inflicting fatal wounds.

Chailyn Oballe, 12, said that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school.

'And
 that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like
 he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his 
pocket and covered it with his shirt.'

Differing accounts have been given about the boys' relationship. One has it that Estevez had long been bullied by Timothy Crump. Another that they were all part of the same gang but had fallen out.

'He
 used to be part of their group, but I think they threw him out and they
 started teasing him,' Jorge Guerrero, 47, the porter at the Estevez building on East Clarke Place in High Bridge, said.

He said that on at least four occasions in the last month he had to mop up urine from outside the apartment.

He added that he did not recognize Crump as one of the bullies - but others did.

'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbor Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '[He
 would say] things like, "Ha ha, your mum's a crackhead, you're 
stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mum’s locked up.'

Another family friend Marisol Perez said it was worse than that.

‘They would move their bowels in front of the door, try and set the door on fire,’ she said. ‘Every time the cops would come, the kids would leave, saying there was nothing they could do about it.'

Mrs Estevez and Miss Perez were arrested on June 11 for allegedly selling drugs to an undercover policeman. Both declare their innocence.

Charged: Estevez can be seen centre being taken in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second-degree murder and charged as an adult, police said

Miss Arroyo said that Timothy 'found it funny'. She said that he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him.

The treatment eventually left Estevez suicidal, Marisol Perez, said.

'Two
 weeks ago on May 28 he tried to hang himself in his own apartment,' Miss Perez added. 'His 
father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.'

Estevez
 was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this 
week, even though he told his father he did not want to go because of the
 bullies.

Arrest: A security guard reportedly stopped the fight outside the school, IS 177, and the boy was arrested

'His father brought him to school this morning and said, "Don’t worry, just go straight home after school",' Miss Perez added.

But Timothy Crump's neighbors at a homeless shelter said that he was a quiet child and that Estevez was the bully.

'He
 wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 
'He'd say, "I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you." 
I’ve seen him say it.'

A policeman said that Estevez had borrowed Timothy’s mobile, but was unable to return it. Timothy is believed to have asked for the phone’s return or financial compensation.

Crime scene: Authorities gather outside the school where the teenager was stabbed after class

On Thursday, Estevez appeared at a Bronx courthouse. His father, Felix, was not present at the court because, said defense lawyer Eric Poulos, he had been threatened by Timothy’s family, although his aunts and cousins did attend.

The hearing lasted around 10 minutes and Mr Poulos described months of harassment and intimidation suffered by his client.

The family had repeatedly sought help from the authorities, to little avail, he said.

Judge Laurence Busching ordered Estevez to be held without bail and scheduled the next hearing for Tuesday
