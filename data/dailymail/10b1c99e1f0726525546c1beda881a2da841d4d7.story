Vani Hari has become known as the 'Food Babe' and has built a loyal following of her food blog, where she calls multi-national companies into account

As American fast food chains are forced to tackle the issues of healthy eating and using chemicals in their products, one woman's musings on the food industry are leading to sweeping changes.

She is not a scientist, politician, policymaker or a trained nutritionist.

Vani Hari is a food blogger. Her writing has earned her the nickname 'Food Babe' and a cult following  which has enabled her to influence large companies such as Kraft and Subway to stop putting chemicals into their food.

Hari, of Charlotte in North Carolina, left her job as a managerial consultant to become a blogger in 2011 and began writing down and posting tweets about her concerns that chemicals were being used by some of America's biggest food chains.

Four years later she has been named one of the '30 most influential people on the internet' by Time magazine and has influenced changes, such as Subway removing chemicals from its flour, the New York Post reported. 

However she has been criticised by experts who say her lack of scientific knowledge means she often mixes up the names of chemicals and their impact - and some of her comments can be likened to 'fear mongering.'

Hari's most successful campaign was persuading Subway to stop using ingredients containing azodicarbonamide - a chemical used to bleach and condition flour, which is also found in yoga mats.

The 34-year-old started a campaign by dubbing the compound the 'yoga mat chemical', which paid off when Subway agreed to change its recipe. 

'Subway had to respond to the media blitz. It went worldwide. I was interviewed everywhere,' she told the Post.

'Before my campaign no one in the world knew about azodicarbonamide.'

Subway changed its recipe but later claimed it had been planning to do so anyway.  

Hari was also involved in persuading Kraft not to use yellow dyes in its 'three mac-and-cheeses' and has piled pressure on Starbucks, accusing the company of adding hazardous chemicals to its pumpkin lattes. 

Among Hari's triumphs in getting companies to change the way they use chemicals are Subway and Kraft

She has recently been campaigning for butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) not to be used in cereals as a preserving agent.

Hari said she began to call for change, which is documented in her book The Food Babe Way, released in February, after she noticed the success of others who spoke up about their food concerns - such as 'the pink slime campaign' against lean finely textured beef, after it was featured on a Jamie Oliver show.

However her work has been criticised for its lack of scientific accuracy and mistakes. 

Hari's book The Food Babe way was released in February and has been published on the back of her blog

Yale neurologist Steve Novella has labelled her 'the Jenny McCarthy of food activism.' 

Dr Marion Nestle, of Yale University said that her mistakes were giving the industry a bad name - citing her confusion over ingredients that are used in beer and antifreeze.

Nestle told the New York Post: 'She's making scientific judgments of these chemicals that may or may not be valid or may or may not be meaningful.' 

Throughout her book Hari stresses that chemicals are frequently added to food to improve profit margins rather than nutrition. She writes about her other successes, which include lobbying Chick-fil-a to remove dyes and artificial corn syrup from its products, Arts Atlanta reported.
