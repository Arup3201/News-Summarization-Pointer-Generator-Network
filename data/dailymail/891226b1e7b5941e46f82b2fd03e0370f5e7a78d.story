Twenty years after she drowned her young sons and incited racial tensions in her little South Carolina town by blaming a fictional black carjacker, Susan Smith's world is as fractured as ever.

A source on the inside reveals that, besides being caught having sex with prison guards on two occasions, Smith has taken a lesbian jailhouse lover and sports horrific wrist scars following at least on gory suicide attempt.

Just as nothing can bring back 14-month-old Alex and Michael Smith, 3, one officials says the justice system has yet to bring the now 43-year-old former mother back from the depraved place she was in when she left her little boys trapped in a sinking car.

20 years on: Susan Smith has spent the last two decades paying for the day in 1994 when she strapped her 14-month- and 3-year-old sons Alex and Michael into their car seats and rolled the car into a South Carolina lake

Murdered: Smith initially blamed a 'black man' she claimed carjacked her and then sped off with the boys, who were found strapped into her car at the bottom of a lake

Still troubled: Since her 1995 conviction, Smith has received multiple citations for misbehavior inside prison

'Most murderers are one-time, crime-of-passion people, and they end up becoming good people,' former director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections Jon Ozmint told The State. 

'Susan Smith just hasn't been able to fit that mold.'

Just as was so widely reported following the 1994 arrest that rocked the little town of Union, Ozmint described Smith as the vain, manipulative. 

'She is truly a narcissist, and she thrives on the media's attention. Someone like that, I didn't want to feed that narcissism. Other than passing her on the yard, I wouldn't give her any extra, undue attention,' Ozmint said.

On two occasions in 2000, Ozmint said guards at Smith's initial prison--Women's Correctional Center in Columbia--had sex with Smith despite warnings she should not be left alone with male correctional officers.

'We were back there and arrested a captain and a lieutenant for having improper relations with her,' Ozmint told The State.

Both men lost their jobs, but according to a fellow convict, Smith has found ways to continue her jailhouse delinquency despite being transferred to Leath Correctional Institution in Greenwood.

Stephanie Hulsey. 34, told the National Enquirer back in 2012 that Smith nearly killed herself at age 40 when she slashed her wrists with a smuggled-in razor. 

Sordid life: Smith was twice caught having sexual relations with male prison guards in 2000. She's since taken on a lesbian jailhouse lover, according to a fellow inmate

Locked up: Smith was convicted in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison for killing 14-month-old Alex and 3-year-old Michael. She is up for parole in 2024, when she'll be 53

'There was blood behind spurting everywhere and she was weeping, but she wasn't crying out in pain,' Hulsey said. 'She used to say, 'You don't feel pain when you cut. Cutting takes all the pain away.' 

Hulsey also recalled a jailhouse girlfriend who Smith kept in addition to male paramours with whom she kept in touch via letters.

'Her lover is a big woman who looks like a man,' said Hulsey, who added that one male pen pal has sent Smith thousands of dollars.

Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison, faces her first parole possibility in 2024. She will be 53 years old.

Smith's boys, 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex, disappeared Oct. 25, 1994.

She told deputies they had been taken by an unidentified black man during a carjacking and she wept on national television as she begged for their safe return.

Nine days later, Smith confessed, and the boys' bodies were found in the car, submerged a few feet from a boat ramp at John D. Long Lake in Union County.

Smith was convicted in July 1995. Prosecutor Tommy Pope had sought the death penalty, and he considers the case a loss.

Smith's lawyers vigorously fought to save her life. They brought in testimony she had sex with her stepfather and several other men to argue she was depressed and intended to stay in the car and commit suicide with her sons, but decided to jump out after releasing the emergency brake.

The case incensed the black community because Smith claimed a black man carjacked her and drove off with the children.
