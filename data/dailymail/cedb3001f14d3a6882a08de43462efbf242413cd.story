A woman who ‘died’ before her baby was delivered was brought back to life after her daughter was born.

Medical miracle Erica Nigrelli was 36 weeks pregnant when she suddenly collapsed at work in Missouri City, Texas.

Thanks to her co-workers’ quick thinking, the 32-year-old English teacher will now be able to see baby Elayna grow up.

Miracle: Erica Nigrelli, 32, had no heartbeat when her daughter Elayna was delivered by C-section

Mrs Nigrelli ‘passed out’ in a co-worker’s classroom after complaining about feeling faint and her heart stopped.

Her husband Nathan, also a teacher working at the same high school, said: ‘I opened the door and walked in, and Erica was lying on the floor.’

Colleagues used CPR and a defibrillator on Mrs Nigrelli and were able to keep her alive until paramedics arrived at the scene.

‘There were two lives that were hanging in the balance the whole time,’ Mr Nirgrelli told Woai.com.

Dramatic birth: Baby Elayna was born one month early and doctors fought for both her and her mother's lives

Little fighter: Elayna is now at home with her parents and, apart from still needing extra oxygen, is a healthy three-month-old baby

Upon arrival at the hospital Erica’s heart had stopped beating yet again, and Elayna was delivered by emergency caesarean section – technically a post-mortem birth.

After the Elayna was brought into the world, Mrs Nigrelli’s heart was restarted by doctors, and three months later mother and daughter are near a full recovery.

Mrs Nigrelli’s collapse was caused by an undetected heart defect, and she now has a pacemaker.

Mr and Mrs Nigrelli thank their co-workers for both their lives,

‘Thankful is not even - is not a strong enough word for what they've done for us,’ Mrs Nigrelli said.
