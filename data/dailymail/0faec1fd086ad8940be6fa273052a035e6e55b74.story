Mexican security forces on
Thursday captured the leader of the once-feared Juarez Cartel in
the country's restive north, making it the second drug kingpin
to fall in just over a week.

Vicente Carrillo, 51, long-time head of the Juarez Cartel,
was a fierce rival of Joaquin "Shorty" Guzman, the leader of the
Sinaloa Cartel and the world's most wanted drug boss until his
capture in February.

A turf war between the two cartels in 2009-2011 unleashed a
bloodbath in Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state on Mexico's
border with Texas, making it one of the most violent places in
the world.

Carrillo, alias 'The Viceroy', was captured after
identifying himself with a false name at a checkpoint in the
northern city of Torreon, national security commissioner Monte
Rubido said in a press conference.

End of an era: Carrillo had been the leader of "Cartel de Juarez" drug trafficking organization since 1997

No shots were fired in his arrest, Rubido said, adding that
Carrillo was wanted on five charges related to organized crime
and drug trafficking.

'The criminal organization that he led up until today led to
the strengthening in Chihuahua of various groups that at one
time contributed to Juarez being considered one of the most
violent cities in the world,' Rubido said.

United States had put a $5 million bounty on Carrillo's
head, while Mexico had offered a 30 million peso ($2.24 million)
reward.

President Enrique Pena Nieto took office two years ago
pledging to end a wave of violence that has killed around
100,000 people since the start of 2007. Although homicides have
fallen on his watch, other crimes have increased, including
extortion and kidnapping.

Pena Nieto has been under fire over the past week over the
apparent massacre of dozens of trainee teachers in southwest
Mexico at the hands of gang members and police. He hailed the
capture on Twitter on Thursday.

A keen horseman who used a network of cattle ranches in the
northern state of Chihuahua to store shipments of Colombian
cocaine, Carrillo took over the Juarez Cartel in 1997 after his
brother Amado, known as 'The Lord of the Skies', died during
plastic surgery.

Carrillo's capture comes just days after Hector Beltran
Leyva, one of the most notorious Mexican drug lords still at
large, was captured by soldiers in a picturesque town in central
Mexico popular with American retirees.

It also comes as the government is grappling with public
outrage at an apparent massacre of trainee teachers by police in
league with gang members, which has triggered mass
anti-government protests.

Alejandro Hope, an independent security consultant who used
to work for Mexican state intelligence, said Carrillo and the
Juarez Cartel were not as powerful as they used to be.

Nonetheless, he added, the capture of Carrillo was part of
larger phasing out of the era of the Mexican drug kingpin.
Guzman was arrested in February, and most of his longtime
business partners and enemies are now either dead or jailed.

'In lots of ways, it's the end of the era of the narco,' Hope said, adding that international drug smuggling is now no
longer controlled by large, hierarchical organizations like
Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, but rather by smaller, more violent
groups with less clear organizational structures.

Carrillo, a devout Catholic, was seen as more discreet than
his flamboyant brother, but his position was weakened by the
violence in Ciudad Juarez that claimed nearly 12,000 lives
between 2008 and 2012 alone.

The government said his organization was dealt a major blow
in 2009 when soldiers in Mexico City arrested his nephew,
Vicente Carrillo Leyva, accused of being the No.2 of the Juarez
Cartel.

Drug experts say Carrillo, who had a secondary role in the
Juarez Cartel when his brother was in charge, once ran about a
fifth of the drug business in Mexico.

Carrillo was considered a priority by the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

Hitmen for the Juarez Cartel were behind the high-profile
murders of Lesley Enriquez, an employee of the U.S. consulate in
Ciudad Juarez, as well as her husband and the husband of another
consulate employee in 2010.

The episode strained relations between Mexico and the United
States. The hitmen were extradited to the United States and
jailed.

The late author Charles Bowden, who was an expert on the
drug trade in Ciudad Juarez, once described Carrillo as
soft-spoken but not showy and definitely in charge.

Despite several years of attacks by Guzman's heavily armed
gunmen, Carrillo ceded little ground in Juarez.

His henchmen hit back by torturing and beheading rivals,
while continuing to ship tonnes of cocaine into the United
States, according to U.S. security officials.
