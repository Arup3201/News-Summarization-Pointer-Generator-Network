Any magician worth his salt must master sleight of hand.

But when Amit Gadhia, an in-store entertainer at Harrods, abused his talents to pilfer cash, he wasn’t quite clever enough.

Gadhia, 35, saw his opportunity after being moved to a job on the cheese counter...using one hand to slip money from the till and the other to conceal it.

Magic: Amit Gadhia used his sleight of hand skills to steal money while working at the Harrods food hall

His deception was revealed because the
 day’s takings didn’t match sales that had been rung up and he confessed
 when confronted by staff.

Now Gadhia could be about to perform a vanishing act, after magistrates warned he faced a jail term for stealing about £70.

Gadhia will first have to explain his 
actions to his parents, with whom he lives in Enfield, North London. 
They knew nothing about his crime until they were contacted by the Daily
 Mail yesterday. His father, Rajni, 60, said:  ‘I thought he had gone to
 work as  normal this morning when he left. I didn’t know he was going 
to court.’

Gadhia worked at the Knightsbridge store for two and a half years before he was caught.

Originally an entertainer, he 
performed magic tricks for customers who were then encouraged to buy 
packs of cards and other paraphernalia. He moved to the food hall after a
 position became available and was placed on the cheese counter.

But he was stopped by staff on January
 2 after questions were raised about missing takings. When he was 
searched by staff he was also found to be carrying cocaine.

Prosecutor Tom Gill told Hammersmith 
Magistrates’ Court, in West London: ‘The defendant worked at Harrods on 
the cheese counter, dealing with members of the public and taking money 
for transactions.

‘He was designated a particular till and it was noted there were small amounts of cash going missing.

‘The defendant was previously a 
magician within the store and used his talent to take money with one 
hand and secrete it with the other.’

Gadhia, who is divorced and has no 
children, admitted to police he had taken between £1 and £20 on 
different occasions in the lead-up to Christmas.

Catherine Newey, defending, said her 
client had run into financial difficulties after his parents’ home was 
burgled and he contributed a ‘significant amount’ towards a security 
system.

She added: ‘He simply had no money to 
get the basics and was tempted by the opportunity that arose.’ Gadhia, 
who was cautioned for theft in 2011, admitted theft and possessing a 
controlled drug.

He was unavailable for comment after 
the hearing but his father, who was born in Kenya but is of Indian 
heritage, said the caution involved a previous burglary at the family 
home when he and his wife, Hansa, 56, were on holiday. Mr Gadhia, who 
works in retail, said his son removed other items from the house ‘so 
that I could claim more’.

The father of three added: ‘I don’t know why he does these stupid things. It’s not like we’re not comfortable.

‘He pays me £500 a month because he lives with us but I could have helped if he was in trouble.’

Gadhia is due to return to court on Monday to be sentenced.
