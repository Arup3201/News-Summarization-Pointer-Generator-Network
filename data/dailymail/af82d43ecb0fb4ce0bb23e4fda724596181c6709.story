These incredible pictures show a glider pilot bailing out after a terrifying mid-air collision at 4,500ft.

Grandfather Andy Preston described how he was tipped upside down after what felt like a 'car crash in the air' and forced to quickly open his parachute before falling to the ground.

The 70-year-old farmer, who was taking part in a gliding competition in Cambridgeshire, said it is the worst thing that has happened in his 19 years of flying and admitted he was lucky to get out.

Mid-air: The horrifying events began to unfold after the two pilots collided during a competition in Cambridgeshire. Here they are pictured moments before the crash 

Terrifying: The 70-year-old glider pilot was forced to take drastic action after the wing of his glider fell off

Free fall: As he jumped from the aircraft, he began to fall to the ground, prompting him to quickly release his parachute

'It was very scary. It was like a car crash in the air. I was very lucky to get out. The other glider seemed to come out of nowhere,' the father-of-two said.

'I was 4500 foot up in the air, if you're going to crash then height is your friend.

'There was a very loud crash and my glider seemed to immediately tip upside down. It all happened very quickly.'

Mr Preston, who has two children and two grandchildren added: 'I instantly knew I was in serious trouble. In training they teach you there are three things you have to do. I pulled the handle to open the canopy and then I pulled the buckle to release me and because of the latitude I was at I just fell out.'

'Once I was free of the aircraft I released the parachute. When I knew I was in trouble I just focused on getting on with it and my training kicked in.

'I then had two or three minutes of drifting down and there was no wind so I literally fell straight down.

'When I was falling time really slowed down. I'd never jumped out a plane before or anything like that so it was a very different experience.'

Mr Preston described how he then crashed landed in a field, just 50 yards in front of a working combine harvester. Concerned the farmer didn't notice him, he managed to get to the edge of the crop.

He was concerned he had killed the pilot of the other glider, but he managed to carry on flying and landed safely.

Lucky: Andy Preston, 70, at his home in Milton Keynes, said the collision felt like a 'car crash in the air' and admitted he was fortunate to have got out

'He didn't stop. I'm not sure if he hadn't seen me or if he thought I was just a professional parachuter.

'It's funny but it's also frightening to think I could have landed safely then been hit by farm equipment.'

'A farm worker came and gave me water and a phone. My leg was bleeding but the pain in my back and neck was the worst.'

Mr 
Preston took up gliding when he was 50 years old after his wife gave him
 lessons as a birthday gift. He has since joined a gliding club, but 
admits this is the worst experience he has been through.

'When
 you go for a parachute jump they're big but gliders are so small that 
the parachutes have to be too - they are intended purely for survival. 
It's equivalent to falling 12 ft off a roof.

'Paramedics
 came and put me on a board. They decided at 9pm I was well enough to 
get off the board but I was very wobbly and stayed the night.

Bailing out: The pilot, aged 50, leapt from his cockpit following the collision and released his parachute

Escape: The pilot fell to the ground as the broken wing and aircraft plummeted to the ground

'I
 found out I had fractured a vertebrae, it's a stable fracture so it 
won't require surgery. When I saw the photos I couldn't believe it, my 
family couldn't believe it either. It was frightening to see the 
pictures of me in the air.'

Mr Preston said his love of gliding came from being an 'adrenaline junky' when he was younger. After 'flipping his car a few times, he learned how to remain cool in dangerous situations and 'not go stiff'.

The 70 year old, who has been a farmer all of his life, said he is sad that the glider has gone, but does not think it is worth getting another.

Local resident Martin Boss, who captured 
the horrifying moment from his garden, was shocked to see the wing break
 away from the glider and plummet to the ground.

The electronics engineer, had been in his garden trying to get photos of 
birds when he saw the gliders about half a mile away.

The 45-year-old,  said it was a shock to see the two gliders collide and one start to break up.

He
 said: 'There were about half a dozen to eight gliders and I took some 
pictures of them. Then two of them touched each other, one of the wings 
came off, and it went straight down.'

Mr Preston's glider  crashed upside down in a field near Little Paxton in Cambridgeshire. The broken wing landed nearby.

The
 pilot of the second glider was able to land safely on an airfield near 
Bedford. The accident in now being investigated by the British Gliding 
Association (BGA).

Drifted: The pilot, safely suspended by the parachute, drifted slowly towards the ground as the broken wing sailed further away from the aircraft

The
 pilots were taking part in the week-long Hus Bos Challenge Cup on 
Saturday afternoon, which had 35 contestants, and each glider was 
believed to have been flying at around 50mph.

They were flying from the Gliding Centre at Husbands Bosworth, near Market Harborough in Leicestershire.

Pete Stratten, chief executive of the BGA, said: 'This type of accident happens very rarely, it is a relatively safe sport but everybody does accept there is a greater risk than climbing on a commercial aircraft.'

He said each glider would have been flying around 50mph and the force of the crash was enough to separate the wing from the glider.

He added: 'The pilot jumped out effectively and the other pilot landed immediately.' 

Wreckage: The damaged glider landed upside down in a field in Little Paxton, Cambridgeshire. The broken wing fell to the ground and rested nearby 

Scene: Police were called to the crash site while the pilot was taken to hospital

Reflection: The father-of-two has said he is sad that the glider is gone, but does not think it is worth getting another one
