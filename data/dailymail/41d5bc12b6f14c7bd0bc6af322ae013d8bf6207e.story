Detained: Patrick Rock, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, was arrested by officers of the National Crime Agency almost three weeks ago

The National Crime Agency, dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’, was plunged into a major secrecy row last night after it refused to comment on its arrest of a top Number 10 aide.

Senior officials at the agency maintained total silence on the controversial detention of Patrick Rock.

David Cameron’s trusted advisor was spirited away in the middle of the night when officers knocked on the door of his West London home.

But in an extraordinary move, the fledgling agency said it would not ‘confirm or deny’ its involvement in any ‘on-going investigation’.

This unprecedented declaration hides the fact that hundreds of criminal suspects are being deprived of their liberty in secret.

The Daily Mail can reveal that only a tiny proportion of the 350 people arrested by the agency since it opened its doors last October have received any publicity.

And this ultra-secrecy stands in stark contrast to every other police force in Britain and recently released official guidance.

Police forces will always confirm if an arrest has been made and leaders at the College of Policing state this is clearly in the public interest.

They have gone on to add that forces can also identify suspects if there is a policing purpose, for example reassuring the public or tracing other offenders.

It is understood the NCA policy was shaped by the Leveson Inquiry, which included a raft of proposals to rein in the freedom of the Press.

But it once again highlights concerns that the inquiry into Press standards is enabling police and other officials to withhold key information from the public.

It leaves NCA director general Keith Bristow, who once pledged to be open and transparent, vulnerable to accusations of leading the ‘secret police’.

On his appointment by Home Secretary Theresa May, Mr Bristow said he would not repeat the mistakes of his predecessors at the Serious Organised Crime Agency, known as Soca.

The former Warwickshire chief constable said crime-fighters could not complain about criticism if they failed to tell people what they were doing.

His predecessor, former MI5 chief Sir Stephen Lander, gained a reputation for extreme secrecy after openly boasting about Soca’s closed doors. The secrecy row is particularly difficult for Mr Bristow because both Mrs May and Mr Cameron have called on police chiefs to be open about who  they arrest.

They have both said there should be a ‘working assumption’ in favour of not only confirming arrests, but identifying suspects.

Last year Mr Bristow’s former force was criticised after refusing to name a retired police officer charged with stealing £113,000 from its headquarters.

Warwickshire Police was forced into a humiliating U-turn amid a national outcry at what some suspected was an attempt to protect their own.

Questions also remain over why the explosive allegations against Rock were reported directly to the NCA, and not Scotland Yard.

Downing Street officials are in regular contact with a Diplomatic Protection Group sergeant based in Charing Cross who is responsible for their security.

The Met has its own child abuse investigation command which has been responsible for thousands of successful inquiries.

But Whitehall insiders suggested that senior officials may have lost confidence in the force over the damaging ‘Plebgate’ row which led to the resignation of Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell.

One official said the Prime Minister’s closest advisors may have been ‘more comfortable’ dealing with the NCA, whose creation was a Tory manifesto pledge. Asked if police should confirm if an arrest has been made, a College of Policing spokesman replied: ‘Absolutely, that is in the public interest and is in our guidance.’

But an NCA spokesman said it is not ‘appropriate or practical’ to publicise every arrest, and that the agency must balance ‘transparency’ with ‘operational integrity’.

‘We also need to consider the right to a fair trial and the risk of jeopardising a prosecution in the event that charges are brought,’ the spokesman added.

‘An individual who has not been charged, and may still be released without charge, should reasonably expect to have their details made public only when law enforcement has the evidence to bring charges.’
