Greece has threatened to hit Germany with a bill for tens of billions of pounds in outstanding reparations for Nazi war crimes during the Second World War.

The move is an indication of growing outrage in Athens at the strictures being placed on the Greek economy by EU paymasters led by Germany.

The finance ministry said yesterday that four experts would scour archives and determine by the end of the year how much is owed.

Economists say that if Germany had 
paid Greece what it is alleged to owe, it would dramatically improve the
country's likelihood of coming through its debt crisis.

Greece suffered greatly after being 
invaded by Hitler's forces but, unlike every other country Germany went 
to war with, has not been paid compensation. Campaigners say the Paris 
Reparations Agreement of 1946 obliges Germany to pay Greece around 
£86 billion.

Deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras said: 'The matter remains pending. Greece has never resigned its rights.'

However, he called for a 'realistic 
and cool-headed' approach to the issue, which seems certain further to 
sour relations between Germany and Greece.

Veteran Left-wing politician 
Manolis Glezos, a hero of Greece's wartime resistance movement, said: 
'The current German government is pursuing a policy of subordination of 
Greeks, of crushing their freedom and financial independence.

'Germany wants Greece to become little
more than a financial protectorate, but the Greek people will not be so
easily controlled.'

Great risks: If Greece left from the eurozone, it might eventually be necessary to create a common 'debt union' to stabilise problem countries like Italy and Spain

Greek officials have also tabled an 
official request for the return of archaeological treasures looted by 
Nazis  during the occupation of Crete, Samos and areas in Northern 
Greece.

Germany's foreign minister says Greece's claim is 'non-existent'.

The International Court of Justice in 
The Hague has previously ruled that Germany is exempt from being sued in
overseas courts by Greek sufferers of Second World War atrocities.

Greek officials have this week been 
locked in talks with the country's bailout creditors who are demanding a
fresh round of austerity cuts.

Crunch talks: Mrs Merkel and Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in Berlin last month, shortly before the German leader's change of heart

Prime minister Antonis Samaras met 
officials from the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central 
Bank who are examining proposals to ease the conditions of a 
£9.2 billion austerity package for 2013-14.

Greek president Karolos 
Papoulias warned yesterday that the Greek  people had endured enough 
misery as the price of staying in the euro.

But he was optimistic that 'things are
moving in the right direction' in negotiations with international 
creditors and European partners.

In Germany, influential magazine Der 
Spiegel claimed Chancellor Angela Merkel has made a U-turn to stop 
Athens leaving the euro after concluding that a Greek exit would be more
costly to the German economy.

* The US's 
prized AAA credit rating could be cut if it cannot get to grips with its
budget. Credit rating agency Moody's warned yesterday that it will act 
if the White House and Congress cannot agree on next year's government 
spending package after the November presidential election.
