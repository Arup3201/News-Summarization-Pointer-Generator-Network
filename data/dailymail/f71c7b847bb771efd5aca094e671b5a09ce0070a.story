There was a time during last year’s Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium when it seemed as though the world might be about to fall in on David Moyes and his United team.

Three goals in eight minutes spanning either side of half-time left United four adrift with 40 minutes still to play. Ultimately, the game ended 4-1, an early low in a season that was to have many.

Certainly it appeared last season that the balance of power in Manchester had tilted City’s way and pretty much stayed there. The gap was big and looked set to get bigger.

2013-14 - United 0-3 City, City 4-1 United

2012-13 - United 1-2 City, City 2-3 United 

2011-12 - City 1-0 United, City 2-3 United (FA Cup), United 1-6 City

2010-11 - City 1-0 United (FA Cup), United 2-1 City, City 0-0 United,

2009-10 - City 0-1 United, United 3-1 City (League Cup), City 2-1 United (League Cup), United 4-3 City

Fast forward 13 months from that day in M11 and City have much to be pleased about. They have two trophies — one of them the Barclays Premier League — and a new training ground standing in the shadow of a stadium that is undergoing expansion.

Oddly, though, United and their new coach Louis van Gaal will travel from their base at the Lowry Hotel on Sunday morning sensing an opportunity of sorts. There is no swagger about City at the moment, no joy. Their coach Manuel Pellegrini looks like a man with a permanent migraine, and his players look leggy and fretful yet it is only November.

City start as favourites. They are the champions, they are at home and they have match-winners in their team. United, though, can see chinks of light through the City barricades and perhaps sense it’s time to remind their upstart neighbours that this remains a two-club town.

‘In a tactical way I know what we have to expect,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It is not the greatest moment of Manchester City, and I have said that we are growing and developing ourselves. We have a good feeling about this match.’

If City’s problem is that they have appeared a little flat during a three-game winless run, Van Gaal fears his team may suffer from an excess of energy. Robin van Persie’s late equaliser at home to Chelsea last Sunday felt like a significant one in the context of United’s season and Van Gaal expressed concern that it may have set adrenaline levels running a little too high.

‘For the fans it is unbelievably big as a rivalry and I have felt that also with a lot of the players in the squad this week,’ he said. ‘Especially with Ryan Giggs because when he presented the analysis of Manchester City, I felt more tension with him. It was good to see that.

‘He knows it, he has the experience as a player and now maybe as an assistant manager. But we don’t have to accelerate this feeling because it is football and you have to play the game, not only a game with emotion but also in a tactical way. That is what we are doing, that is how we are preparing.

‘Ryan has transferred the idea of emotion and I have transferred the idea of how we have to play.’

Certainly it’s hard to imagine anyone ever accusing Pellegrini of being emotional. On Friday, the City manager was as reluctant to add to the hyperbole that usually precedes a Manchester derby.

Van Gaal admitted to having been impressed by Ryan Giggs' intense presentation on Manchester City

All 20 Premier League clubs will have this poppy on their shirts either this weekend or next to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. 

Clubs wear poppies on their shirts each year but for 2014, the Royal British Legion has approved a one-off Poppy with the citation ‘1914-2104 Football Remembers’ written underneath. 

That, of course, is the Chilean’s prerogative. It is not his responsibility to add to the sideshow, only to find a way to improve upon recent performances.

With David Silva absent and Yaya Toure facing a fitness test on Saturday, Pellegrini certainly has his work cut out. City were wretched against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday and, in truth, it was a performance that had been coming.

‘I don’t know what pressure is,’ insisted Pellegrini. ‘I think it’s very difficult to analyse the season at this moment when you are only in October and you have only played nine games in the Premier League. I think always you have better moments and bad moments in the season.

‘If you review last year (and compare it with) what we are doing at this moment, I think we were not playing better than today and the criticisms were exactly the same as they are today... it’s not good to do it but normally all the teams have the moment in the season when you are not in your best moment.

‘It is important for it to be at the beginning of the season and not at the end of the season. I’m sure our team will be a strong team again.’

Van Gaal was not present when City lost on Wednesday. He sent assistant Marcel Bout to the Etihad instead. Their preparations for this game began in earnest early last week, though, when Van Gaal called Wayne Rooney, his captain, back to the training ground unexpectedly one afternoon.

‘I have heard that he has scored a lot of goals against Manchester City, the most of any player,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I said that to him to stimulate him but he doesn’t need that. I am very happy that he can play again and he shall play.’

Rooney was the only United player who performed at the Etihad last season. He will need some help on Sunday. If he gets it, then United — the underdogs — have a chance.

Both clubs are owned by foreign billionaires, United by the Glazer family and City by Sheikh Mansour. Here NICK HARRIS compares two contrasting financial approaches to ownership.

OWNERS WITH DEEP POCKETS 

£866m Sheikh Mansour’s investment into City, including clearing debts and transfers.

£723m Money taken out of United under the Glazers relating to their ‘leveraged’ takeover in 2005.

TOP PLAYERS DON'T COME CHEAP 

£553.2m The net transfer spending by City in the same period. City spent £950million on wages.

£153.4m Net spend on transfers in the first eight years under the Glazers. The club spent £1.1billion on wages.

SPENDING MORE THAN THEIR SHARE 

141 per cent The share of City’s £1.1bilion income spent on transfers and wages in the same eight-year period.

54 per cent The share of United’s £2.2billon income spent on transfers and wages in the Glazers’ first eight years.

...BUT IS THE TIDE TURNING?  

£250m The rough total City will spend this season on net transfers and wages, with costs being forced down to meet UEFA’s FFP rules.

£350m The rough total United will spend this season on net transfers and wages, and more if they spend again in January.
