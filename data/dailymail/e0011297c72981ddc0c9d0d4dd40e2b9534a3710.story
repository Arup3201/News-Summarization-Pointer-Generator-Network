It is said that every dog has its day – and after seven years, rescuers hopes this lurcher’s time has come.

Thought to be Britain’s least wanted dog, Jed has been overlooked by around 17,000 potential owners since he was taken in by the Dogs Trust as a four-month-old pup.

His first family found him too energetic and the second had to return him after a change in circumstances.

Least wanted dog in Britain? The Dogs Trust describes the lurcher as 'friendly, affectionate and well behaved'

Darlington’s Dogs Trust has made a fresh appeal to find a home for the ‘friendly and affectionate’ dog. 

Carer Nikki Holroyd said: 'Jed came into us from another kennels as a four-month old puppy.

'He has been rehomed a couple of times but circumstances have changed and it hasn't worked out.

'He is really cuddly and he loves affection. He spends his day in the office with all the staff, laying on a duvet.

'Lurchers often get overlooked. People are put off by how much exercise they think they need but they don't need too much.

'Jed has been in kennels for a long time and he just needs someone to give him a chance.'

The Dogs Trust says Jed will need an experienced person to rescue him because can be energetic and needs some training.

A spokesman said: 'Jed loves his carers and has lots of good friends in the centre. He loves to play with his cuddly toys, and to dash about on the field with his doggy chums.

'He can run very fast as you can imagine, but then he likes nothing better than to crash out on his comfy duvet for forty winks.

'Jed is a friendly and affectionate chap who just needs some discipline and routine.

'He can be very well behaved with other dogs and could live with a family with older teenagers so long as they are sensible around him.

'He needs to be with someone who works only part time as he does like someone to give him lots of hugs during the day.'

According to the Battersea Dogs Home, the average stay for a dog in its care is just 29 days.

Its longest resident is a hound called Biscuit who has been there six months.

A volunteer said: 'We've certainly never had one for as long as seven years. It is a very long time and a case of very bad luck.

'They are normally with us for an average of 29 days, sometimes less, sometimes more, and in rare cases up to two years.'

Earlier this year a homeless cat called Casey was dubbed 'Britain's most unwanted pet' after spending 13 years in care. Cats stay in centres for an average of 35 days before a new home is found.
