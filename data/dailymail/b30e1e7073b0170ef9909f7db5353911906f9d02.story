The mother of Sandy Hook Elementary gunman Adam Lanza has been remembered at a small family-only gathering at the Kingston, New Hampshire home where she grew up.

Nancy Lanza, who was shot by her 20-year-old son as she lay in bed in their Connecticut home last Friday, lived in the 1760s-era home where her brother James Champion, a policeman, now lives.

On Thursday, around two dozen relatives and friends in dark clothing attended the home for the service, but it is not known whether the memorial also served as a funeral or if she has been buried.

While authorities said her body had been claimed and released to a funeral home - without providing further details - they have not said whether Adam's body has been claimed.

Remembered: A memorial service was held in New Hampshire for Nancy Lanza on Thursday afternoon

After shooting her dead, he stole her
 guns and car and drove to Sandy Hook Elementary, which he had once attended, before shooting dead 20 children, six teachers and 
himself.

It is unclear what will become of 
Adam Lanza's body if it is not claimed.

In Connecticut, typical procedure is to have the police department 
record that no next of kin can be found or that they are refusing to 
identify the body.

A 
funeral home would then provide a list of volunteers who are willing to take 
custody of the body through the courts. The remains would be buried or cremated with $1,800
 state funds.

It is expected that Nancy Lanza's 
estate would pay for the funerals.

It is not known 
whether his father Peter Lanza, to whom he had not spoken in two years, 
or his older brother Ryan attended the service for his mother on 
Thursday.

The family has 
stayed silent over the matter and residents of Kingston said the 
memorial had been kept quiet to avoid media attention.

Mr
 Champion was seen visiting the post office on Thursday but would not be
 interviewed. 'It's a hard time,' he told the New York Times. 'It's a 
very hard time right now.'

Adam Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, has also not spoken publicly about the massacre. He has not been seen around his Stamford, Connecticut home in several days and is assumed to be in hiding.

Neighbors of Peter Lanza and second 
wife Shelley Cudiner told MailOnline that the pair packed up their car 
and left their home shortly after being informed of Adam's involvement in the 
massacre.

Peter Lanza learned of the shooting from a reporter outside his home, which is located about an hour from Sandy Hook.

Peter has been separated from Nancy Lanza since 2001 and the couple filed for divorce in 2009.

Their divorce was finalized about a year later, around the time that their first son, Ryan, graduated from college and moved to work for accounting firm Ernst & Young in New York.

Peter, a successful finance executive at General Electric, had not spoken to Adam in almost two years. Adam cut off contact with his father after he remarried, according to sources.

Adam and his brother were also not communicating for several years, according to Peter Lanza's sister-in-law, Marsha Lanza.

Before he remarried, Peter Lanza had 
visited with his son at least once a week. He and Nancy had joint 
custody of Adam, according to their divorce papers.

Peter was 
supporting Nancy and his son with $240,000 in annual alimony and child 
support payments - an amount that was set to rise to $289,000 in 2012.

He had also agreed to pay for Adam Lanza's college tuition, car and medical insurance. He was making $445,000 at the time of the divorce, records show.

While Peter Lanza hasn't spoken about the tragedy publicly, he released a statement on Saturday.

'Our hearts go out to the families 
and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured,' he 
said in the statement.

'Our family is grieving along with all those who 
have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express 
how heartbroken we are.

'We are in a state of disbelief and trying to 
find whatever answers we can. We too are asking why. We have cooperated 
fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so. Like so many of 
you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has 
transpired.'

Nancy Lanza's memorial service came as it was 
revealed that Adam had desperately wanted to join 
the Marines, but she would not let him.

Nancy Lanza 
originally supported her son's plans - hoping that military rigors would
 give him the focus and structure his life so badly needed.

But she later she changed her mind, believing that her mentally unstable and 
introverted son would be unable to cope with the hardships of life in 
the Armed Forces.

Family friend Ellen Adriani told the New York Post that
 Nancy reminded her son that he didn't like being touched and if he was 
injured in service, doctors and nurses would need to look after him.

Peter Wlasuk, who knew the family, told ctpost.com that Lanza would play the violent military video game for hours, alone in his dark basement.

It
 emerged on Wednesday that prior to his deadly massacre, Adam was left 
alone with an arsenal of weapons in the $1.4million mansion he lived in 
with his mother while she went on vacation.

Over the three-day period, he refused
 to speak to Nancy and sources believe he may have become so consumed 
with anger, that it drove him to plan one of America's worst school 
shootings.
