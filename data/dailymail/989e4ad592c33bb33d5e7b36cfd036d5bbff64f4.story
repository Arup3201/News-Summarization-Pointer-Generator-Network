David de Gea is closing in on a new long-term Manchester United contract after Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti made clear he is happy with his goalkeeping options.

Real have been closely monitoring De Gea's progress at Old Trafford, his outstanding displays for Louis van Gaal's side alerting the Spanish giants.

United have made clear their intention to sign the keeper to an improved contract, but Madrid's interest had created a potentially alarming stumbling block towards fresh terms.

However, Ancelotti has informed intermediaries he is happy with Iker Casillas and Keylor Navas and that a move for De Gea is now not a priority for Real.

The news comes as a huge boost to United's hopes of extending the 24-year-old's contract, which currently expires at the end of next season.

Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel says a new contract for De Gea would send an important message as the Old Trafford club look to get back to the top.

Schmeichel, who won five Premier League titles, three FA Cups and one Champions League title with United, says the club must tie the stopper down to show their rivals at home and abroad that they mean business after a difficult 18 months following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. 

'It's very important the club's best players sign new contracts to send a signal,' Schmeichel told Sky Sports.

'It shows that they believe in the Manchester United project and believe the club will go back not only to the top of the Premier League but also European football.'
