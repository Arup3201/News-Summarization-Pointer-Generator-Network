Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said teachers are as vulnerable as pupils online. Guidance  advises teachers to avoid befriending pupils on social media

Teachers should monitor photographs posted of themselves online and not connect with their pupils over social media to avoid becoming victims of cyber bullies, the Education Secretary has said.

New guidance for teachers will advise them to avoid accepting friend requests on Facebook from current and former students and not to connect with them via Twitter. 

It will also say that schools have a legal duty to protect their teachers from online abuse.

The advice comes as it is revealed that one in five teachers have been targeted with derogatory comments by pupils online, the Independent reported. 

Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, said teachers need to be comfortable that their schools would take action if they fell victim to cyber bullies. 

She said: 'We all know the dangers children face from online bullies but we – but we sometimes forget that teachers are not immune from abuse which impacts on them professionally and personally.'

The guidance, due to be published by the Department of Education, aims to safeguard both teachers and their students from online trolls. 

A survey by the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, recently found that one in five teachers had been subjected to abuse online. 

This may have been in the form of derogatory comments and in some cases had affected their teaching careers.  

In one example a pupil had tweeted: 'You are a paedo and your daughter is a whore.'

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said cyberbullying can have a 'pernicious impact.' 

The guidance urges teachers to ensure their security settings online remain high, as well as those of family and friends to avoid embarrassing photographs and information being accessed by pupils and their parents. 

Teachers are also advised to search for their names online to see what has been posted about them - including photographs and comments and ensure snaps of them drinking or at parties are not readily accessible.

In some instances teachers can fall victim to the actions of scornful parents who search for compromising photographs online and then send them to headteachers in revenge for their children being disciplined or left out of sport teams.

The guidance will say this type of abuse could constitute a crime. 

Teachers can be particularly vulnerable to the abuse via RateMyTeachers - a site which allows pupils to post derogatory remarks about their appearance and performance in the classroom.
