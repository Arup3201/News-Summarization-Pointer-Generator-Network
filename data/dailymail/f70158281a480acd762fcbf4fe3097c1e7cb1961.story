The laid-back lifestyle and good weather helped keep Australia ranked as the best place to live for the third year in a row.

America was just narrowly shut out of the top five places, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Better Life Index, which ranked the U.S. in sixth place.

Sweden, Canada, Norway and Switzerland all beat out the U.S., as Denmark, the Netherlands, Iceland and the U.K. filled out the rest of the top ten.

Winner: Australia is the best place in the world to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

The survey featured 11 different criteria for each country, including income, jobs, housing and health.

Overall, Americans rank in the middle of most of the surveyed countries on issues like safety, civic engagement, the environment and the all-encompassing life satisfaction.

One of the categories where the U.S. ranked among the worst countries was work-life balance, as average Americans work 1,787 hours per year as opposed to the OECD average of 1,776 hours per year.

That said, the hard work seems to be paying off on the whole as the household net-adjusted income for Americans is $38,001, which is significantly higher than the overall survey average of $23,047 per year.

Other criteria found that Americans are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 83 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day.

The vast majority- 90 per cent of Americans- believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, in line with the OECD average.

The life expectancy birth in the United States is almost 79 years, one year lower than the OECD average of 80 years - women live to an average 81 years, compared with 76 for men.

In spite of the Americans' best efforts, Austrialians still came out on top with higher rankings nearly across the board.

The two areas where Americans beat Austrialians was in income and surprisingly they even managed to get a lower score when it came to the work-life balance.

In general, Australians are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 84 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day.

Positive feelings were qualified as feelings of rest, pride in accomplishment, and general enjoyment.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, negative feelings included ones of pain, worry, sadness, and boredom.

Austrailia's 87 per cent of 'positive feelings' came in higher than the OECD average of 80 per cent.

And 94 per cent of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, higher than the OECD average of 90 per cent.

The life expectancy is an additional two years in Australia, at 82 years.

Despite the satisfaction rating, almost 14 per cent of employees work very long hours, much higher than the OECD average of 9 per cent, with 21 of men working very long hours compared with just 6 per cent for women.

Number 10: In Britain, 95 per cent of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need

In Britain, the survey shows the average household net-adjusted disposable income is higher than the OECD average, but there is a considerable gap between the richest and poorest – the top 20 per cent of the population earn nearly six times as much as the bottom 20 per cent.

In terms of employment, about 12 per cent of employees work very long hours, more than the OECD average of 9 per cent - 18 per cent of men work very long hours compared with just 6 per cent for women.

Three quarters of adults aged 25-64 have earned the equivalent of a secondary school degree, close to the OECD average of 74 per cent.

In terms of health, life expectancy is 81 years - for women it is 83 years, compared with 79 for men.

In Britain, 95 per cent of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need.

Briton's are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 85 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day.
