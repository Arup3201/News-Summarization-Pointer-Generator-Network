Nigel Farage and Nick Clegg are to go head-to-head in a live debate on Britain leaving the European Union after the Ukip leader admitted he had ‘absolutely no choice’ but to accept a challenge from the Deputy Prime Minister.

Mr Clegg threw down the gauntlet to Mr Farage yesterday, challenging him to a live showdown between the 'party of in' and the 'party of out'.

Today Mr Farage said he was ready to debate the ‘most important issue this country has faced for hundreds of years’ but called on David Cameron and Ed Miliband to also take part.

Head to head: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg threw down the gauntlet to Ukip's Nigel Farage, challenging him to a live debate

Mr 
Farage repeated his boast that Ukip could win the elections to European 
Parliament in May, and hailed the prospect of a debate as proof that his
 party was now setting the political agenda.

He
 said: 'I have spent years being told I am a nutcase so when the Deputy 
Prime Minister challenged the fruitcakes to engage in a national debate,
 I am delighted.'

Broadcasters
 are already queuing up to televise the debate in prime time, pitching 
Mr Clegg against Mr Farage ahead of the vote on May 22.

Appealing
 to the Ukip leader yesterday, Mr Clegg said: ‘I'll tell you what I'll 
do. I will challenge Nigel Farage to a public, open debate about whether
 we should be in or out of the European Union.

‘He is the leader of the party of out, I am the leader of the party of in.

‘And
 I think It's now time we have a proper public debate so that the public
 can listen to the two sides of the argument and judge for themselves.’

Ukip
 refused to give a definitive response, but suggested that Mr Farage 
would refuse to go head-to-head with Mr Clegg directly unless Labour and
 the Tories also took part.

It led to the Lib Dems accusing Mr Farage of being a ‘chicken’ and running scared from a one-on-one showdown.

But today Mr Farage softened the demand for other leaders to be included, and accepted the Deputy PM’s challenge.

Ukip said it would be 'ridiculous' if David Cameron and Ed Miliband did not take part in the debate

He told LBC 97.3: ‘I nearly choked on my bacon roll when I heard Nick 
Clegg he wanted to have a debate on the big European Question because 
this was the guy three years ago advocating an in-out referendum who now
 says there shouldn’t be a referendum but now wants a debate. So he is 
all over the place.

‘I’ve thought about this overnight… I got 
involved in politics because I felt on the great question of who governs
 out country, our own parliament, the men and women we elect and send 
there or the European Commission and the other institutions in Brussels,
 that we weren’t having a proper talk about this.

‘I’ve battled 
on for 20 years, I have been laughed at, ridiculed, attacked, but at no 
point in the 15 that I have now been an MEP but at no point have we ever
 had a full national debate about the merits or demerits of EU 
membership.

‘Therefore when the Deputy Prime Minister says he 
wants to go public and have a debate with me on this issue I have 
absolutely no choice.

‘I’ve got to say yes because we need to 
have a national debate on what I think is the most important issue this 
country has faced for hundreds of years in terms of our constitution so 
the answer is yes.’

But he said he had ‘one small caveat’, 
adding: ‘I do really want for the Labour party in the shape of Ed 
Miliband in the shape of the Prime Minister to join this debate as well.

‘So the answer is yes I’ll do it with Nick Clegg, but the other two I would like to see them there as well.’

Yesterday
 MailOnline revealed that Mr Cameron had already ruled himself out. A 
Number 10 source said: 'The Prime Minister is running the country. This 
is an invitation that Nick Clegg made to Nigel Farage. There is only one
 party that can deliver a referendum on Europe and that is the 
Conservatives.'

But Mr Farage hit back: ‘Downing Street have already briefed that David Cameron is too busy running the country.

‘But actually Mr Cameron that’s what the debate is about – who is running the country, are you running it? Is the Prime Minister who goes to the House of Commons once a week, or is the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding right when she said in London last week that over 70 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels?

‘I suspect that David Cameron does not ever want to have this debate.

‘I think the splits in the Labour party between New Labour and old Labour over the European question have been highlighted by open door immigration, which hasn’t just put lots of our youngsters out of work, it is has led to wage compression.

‘I suspect that they don’t want to have the debate so it is Nick Clegg and I head-to-head. Let’s have the debate.’

Some Lib Dem insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place at in May's elections to the European Parliament, behind UKIP, the Conservatives, Labour and even the Greens.

Lib Dem party president Tim Farron has warned the election could see the party lose every one of its seats in the European Parliament.

In 2009 the Lib Dems polled almost 14 per cent of the vote, but strategists think it could be halved to just 7 per cent in May.

At the same time Ukip has its sights on coming top in the European Parliament elections, ahead of Labour and the Tories in third.

The Tories have promised to hold an in-out referendum on leaving the EU by 2017, but Mr Clegg has argued it would create unnecessary uncertainty.

He will use the European elections to argue that abandoning the EU would damage jobs in the UK, hamper police in fighting crime, setback the fight against climate change and undermine Britain’s standing in the world.

However, senior Lib Dems fear the elections could see the party wiped out.

Mr Farron told activists: ‘There is one last big test before the general election — Thursday, May 22.

'We defend more than 700 councillors, and [our] MEPs, and at stake are hundreds of campaigners who deserve to win.

In several councils, we are defending our final foothold, and our very presence in the European Parliament could be at stake.

‘It's not just our party's place in Europe that is at stake, it's Britain's too.

‘We know Europe needs reform, and the best place to do that is from within. Only the Liberal Democrats are brave enough to make this argument and put British jobs and investment first.’
