Controversial plans for a second runway at Gatwick costing up to £9billion flew into immediate turbulence from residents and environmental groups after airport bosses unveiled their blueprint today.

They said a new runway in West Sussex, positioned to the south of the current site, could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at Heathrow.

It comes after rivals Heathrow and Stansted both submitted plans to expand to up to four runways.

The Gatwick chiefs said an additional runway would bring potential investment benefits to Britain of around £56billion over the period to 2050, would create up to 19,000 jobs and support wider economic and social regeneration.

Also, a two-runway Gatwick would not breach European and national air quality standards and is backed by key local authorities and business groups.

The Gatwick plans will be submitted to the Government-appointed Airports Commission headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies. The commission is due to make its final report on airport capacity in summer 2015.

Last week London Mayor Boris Johnson was at the at the centre of a Nazi jibe row after one of Britain's to architects branded his plans for a Thames Estuary airport on a par with the grandiose projects that Adolf Hitler might have dreamed up.

Sir Terry Farrell, who is working on Gatwick's bid to build a second runway and  who designed the distinctive MI6 spy headquarters which features in many recent James Bond movies, said the London Mayor's  plan to build a £65billion airport on the Thames Estuary  was 'mad' and comparable to the sort of project that Adolf Hitler might have dreamed up.

Sir Terry told London's Evening Standard newspaper: 'When people say that you have got to have vision, well Hitler had vision.

'Vision can be a madness where you get so obsessed you throw everything you have got on the roulette table and hope you got it right.'

Hitler famously used his personal architect and armaments minister Albert Speer to draw up plans on an epic scale  for a radically re-designed Berlin – to be renamed 'Germania' after a German victory.

Sir Terry, who has also  designed some of the world's largest airports and railway stations, said the scale of the proposed four-runway project would be unprecedented in Britain and made the Government's HS2 high-speed rail project 'look like chicken feed'.

The airport dog-fight came after the Mayor underlined his commitment to an estuary airport by naming Sir Norman Foster's £65billion Isle of Grain plan as his first choice. The Mayor also wants to shut Heathrow at a cost of £15 billion and create a new London borough for 250,000 residents.

Sir Terry's comments escalated the tension between Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick as they all this week go public with their rival plans.

Sir Terry said closing Heathrow and moving the predominant London airport to the eastern extreme would mean 'flipping London', adding: 'In that case people say you could make Heathrow a new town. It makes HS2 look like chicken feed. It's going to be the biggest project the UK has ever done in its history.'

But expansion is vigorously opposed by 
the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) protest group and the 
local Green Party MEP who said it would blight homes and mean 'more 
noise, more pollution and more congestion nearby.'

Under a legal agreement made in 1979 the West Sussex airport cannot build a second runway before 2019 – and Gatwick' insists it will honour that agreement. But this runs out in just six years' time.

Gatwick put forward three main options for how a southern parallel runway would operate costing between £5billion and £9billion.

The airport bosses said none of the options presented significant project complexity or risk and all could open to passengers by 2025.

Depending on which option is chosen, the airport's capacity would increase from the current figure of 34.2 million passengers a year to between 67 million and 87 million by the 2040s.

Gatwick said the land required for the construction of a second runway had been formally safeguarded since 2003.

It is estimated that the potential number of properties lost for the runway options range between 50 and 100 homes at Gatwick, as against 950 to 2,700 at Heathrow if a third, extra, runway is built there.

Also,
the Gatwick executives said road and rail access requirements are 
significantly less than the needs of Heathrow or for the plans for a 
brand new airport to the east of London favoured by London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Gatwick chief executive Stewart 
Wingate said: 'London is the best -connected city in the world today 
because the UK's aviation industry is one of the most competitive and 
innovative.

'Our proposal to
the Airports Commission builds on this foundation and would ensure that
the UK has an airports policy which offers the additional capacity that
Britain needs, improves the resilience of the airports system and, 
above all, can be delivered.'

He
added:'Our evidence shows clearly that an additional runway at Gatwick 
would best serve the needs of all passengers, and give certainty to 
airlines, communities and businesses. It would deliver the connectivity 
the UK needs with lower environmental impacts, whilst spreading the 
economic benefits.

Option 1: Dependent Segregated Mode: Runways spaced closely together - with a separation less than 760m - are too close to operate independently to each other. They are dependent on one another. So the operations on one runway would temporarily interrupt the operations on the other. One runway would be used for aircraft arrivals and one for departures - a method of operation called ¿segregated mode¿. This method of operation could support around 67 to 70 ¿movements¿ (landings and/or take-offs) per hour, which could equate to an overall two runway capacity of some 60 to 66 million passengers per year by 2050.

Option 2: Independent Segregated Mode: If the runways are positioned 760m or more apart the runways can be operated independently of each other. This means that arrivals on one runway do not affect departures on the other. Capacity could increase to around 75 landings and take-offs per hour equating to some 75-82 million passengers per year by 2050.

Option 3: Independent Mixed Mode: If the runways are at least 1,035m apart, it can then be possible to operate them in ¿independent mixed mode¿. Each runway could accommodate both arriving and departing aircraft. In this way flexibility and capacity would be maximised. Capacity could amount to between 95 and 100 take-off and landings per hour or more and would equate to some 80 to 87 million passengers per year by 2050.

'A 
two-runway Gatwick, as part of a constellation of three major airports 
surrounding London, will also provide flexibility in an industry where 
the only constant is change.'

Earlier, Mr Wingate told the BBC Radio
4 Today programme: 'I think there are a number of airlines in this 
debate with a number of different positions. Certainly some of the 
Heathrow airlines, as you would expect, support Heathrow, whereas the 
airlines here at Gatwick are very supportive of the second runway being 
built.'

Mr Wingate admitted that Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who represents the nearby constituency of Horsham, has 'reservations' about the plans.

He added: 'We have certainly briefed Francis on the plans that we have. I think it is fair to say that Francis has some reservations about the second runway project at Gatwick but is very supportive of the work that we are doing and will see the detail that we layout today and hopefully that will help to convince Francis that this is the right solution.'

But Keith Taylor, the Green Party MEP for the South East, attacked the proposals for the expansion of Gatwick airport.

He said: 'It's no surprise that the bosses of Gatwick want to build this second runway. They are hell-bent on bringing more flights into the UK's airspace and they seem more than happy to gloss over the grave environmental and health implications of airport expansion.'

Mr Taylor said: 'The residents around Gatwick, who already have their lives blighted by the airport's noise, will be greatly concerned about the prospect of another runway being built on their doorstep. I'll be joining residents in fighting against the proposal for another runway which would mean more noise, more pollution and more congestion nearby.'

Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) protest group has suggested that airport bosses were announcing a second runway now to drive up the company's value and share price in advance of a sell-off by some key investors: 'It's like getting planning permission for a house extension before you sell it. And they've made no secret they want to sell by 2018,' said a spokesman.

 

@highlight

Runway could be built to the south of the airport and is being planned to rival Heathrow and Stansted expansion plans

@highlight

Plans for expansion would be quieter than an extra runway at Heathrow and it would not breach air quality standards

@highlight

However local pressure groups are against expansion saying it would create more noise, pollution and congestion
