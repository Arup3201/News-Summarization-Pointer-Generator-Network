Jailed: Steven Hughes, 50, was jailed for three years after blackmailing his employee into paying £30,000

An innocent man was forced to pay £30,000 to his boss who threatened to derail his marriage by exposing a fake affair.

The victim had been awarded £40,000 in damages from his previous employers after he was fired over false claims he made inappropriate advances towards a woman.

Suffering marriage problems after having a stroke, the unnamed man eventually found casual work in a furniture business with close friend Steven Hughes.

But when he told Hughes about the ordeal, his new boss devised a series of scams to steal the money - including a bizarre 'kiss and tell' threat.

Father-of-three Hughes, 50, recruited a friend to pose as the victim's former colleague and told her to demand £10,000 - or she would expose their 'liaison'.

In a hand-written contract that he was forced to sign, the woman made false claims the victim had groped her breasts.

The man was said to have felt 'backed into a corner' and agreed to pay the cash.

Today, Hughes, who has not repaid the victim, was jailed for three years after he admitted fraud and blackmail at Manchester's Minshull Crown Court.

The court heard how the victim, from the Greenfield area of Oldham, confided in Hughes about asking a former colleague to go for a drink in what was described as 'inappropriate circumstances'.

He then told him about a 'settlement fee' of £40,000 he received from his former employer.

In September 2011, the victim was called by a woman who claimed to be the same woman he was accused of inappropriately approaching through work.

She demanded £10,000 from him and threatened to 'tell her story' to a newspaper and make false accusations of sexual assault if he failed to pay.

The distressed victim told Hughes about the threat - but the boss falsely said his business had also received a phone call from the same woman.

Hughes falsely told the victim that his solicitor had advised him that the allegations could be so damaging that the furniture company would be shut down.

The victim felt backed into a corner so agreed to pay the money.

Kiss and tell: Hughes offered to take the victim's money and give it to 'the woman'. He returned with this receipt

Hughes then told the man he would take the money to the woman, and returned with a handwritten statement to confirm she had received the payment.

It read: 'This payment is for harassment and sexual advances. Touching my breasts, We will have no contact with anyone or speak to anyone about this matter. This is the end of the matter.'

In early 2012 year, the victim gave £13,000 to Hughes, who told him about an investment where specialist furniture could be bought from Malaysia and sold for 'handsome profit' in the UK.

When he was then told by Hughes that a return on the furniture investment had been 'delayed', the victim became suspicious and contacted the police in May 2012.

It emerged he had also paid Hughes a further £2,000 after he falsely claimed he could get a quick sale for his house through a property firm.

In court Hughes claimed he was 'deeply remorseful.'

But Judge Maurice Green told Hughes: 'These were extremely serious and particularly mean offences.'

After the case, PC Rebecca Gross of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim considered Steven Hughes to be a friend, but now we know that he was manipulating this man for financial gain.

'Over a period of time, Hughes took complete advantage of the trust that had been placed in him, seizing on the victim’s vulnerabilities.

'These vulnerabilities included a sense of distress and embarrassment at the way in which he left his job, and that became the fuel for this man to become a victim of blackmail.

'Hughes has now been put behind bars for his dishonesty and I hope that this gives the victim some closure so he can take steps to rebuild his life.'
