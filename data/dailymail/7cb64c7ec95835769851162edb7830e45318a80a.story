Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Joe Hart were among the players given a night off by Roy Hodgson as England named just seven subs for the World Cup warm-up game against Ecuador.

Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson were the other players omitted as Hodgson shuffled his pack following the 3-0 win against Peru last Friday.

Hodgson looked to test the depth and experience of his squad handing starts to Rickie Lambert, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley, Luke Shaw and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami.

Wayne Rooney was not given a night off and started the game for England in an experimental role on the left hand of England's attack.

Ahead of the game veteran midfielder Frank Lampard, another starter, advised his young team-mates to grasp the opportunity with both hands and not be overcome by nerves.

'My message to the younger players will be to enjoy the game, to play without fear, listen to the manager and do what he wants to do because we have done a lot of preparation,' he said.

'When we were playing against Peru a few days ago, we were thinking about Italy,' Lampard added.

'We were thinking about Brazil and what we are going to do out there.

'So they have to take that on board, but, more than that, they have to enjoy it and play the way theyâ€™ve played to get themselves into the squad. We have all watched them play and we have all been excited by them. So carry on doing that.'

England have one more warm-up game, against Honduras on Saturday, before they open their World Cup campaign against Italy on June 14.
