Tragic: It was claimed Sadie Anne Jayne McGrady may have had less severe injuries if repairs not not been substandard

A six-year-old girl died in a car that had been written-off after a previous crash then welded together in a 'botched repair job', a coroner's court has heard. 

Sadie Anne Jayne McGrady, from Mostyn, in north Wales, died from severe head injuries on the A548 in Flintshire, on July 22 last year.

Sadie’s mother Catherine Barlow had attempted to drive across two lanes of a dual carriageway when they were hit at about 11.20am.

Mark Buckley, from Ashton under Lyme, said he was overtaking vehicles on the dual carriageway eastbound, at about 60-65mph, when Miss Barlow’s car suddenly appeared in front of him.

He slammed on the brakes but could not avoid a collision.

Miss Barlow’s car was shunted into the opposite carriageway and when off-duty nurse Leonie Lewis went to help the occupants Miss Barlow said to her: 'I’m so sorry. What have I done?'

When interviewed, she said she had waited for one car to pass, seen Mr Buckley’s car approaching about 200 metres away and thought she had enough time to cross to the central reservation.

But substandard repairs carried out to the silver Vauxhall Corsa following a 2008 insurance write-off may have resulted in Sadie having greater injuries than may otherwise have been expected, a vehicle examiner told the court.

At an inquest into her death yesterday, Sadie’s father John Paul McGrady paid a moving tribute to his daughter.

A statement read to the court in Ruthin said: 'Sadie enjoyed good health. She was full of life.

'Her passing has had a massive, devastating effect on our lives.'

'It has left a massive hole that can never be filled.'

Sadie’s sister Megan who was five spent time in intensive care but has since recovered.

The scene where the six-year-old died last year. According to an expert inadequate welding had been carried out on one of the car's panels

Evidence read out by Mr Gittins on behalf of vehicle examiner Gary Roberts said 'very sub-standard repairs' had been carried out on the side panels of the car next to where Sadie had been sitting.

If a car is written off by an insurance company, they will usually tell DVLA so that a ‘VIC marker’ (Vehicle Identity Check marker) can be put on the vehicle record.

To remove the VIC marker the car needs to pass a VIC test and if it passes it is okay to drive.

The VIC test compares the details DVLA has about the car against the car itself.

It takes place at a VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) test centre. 

A spokesman from the DVLA said: 'When insurers notify us of vehicles on which they have made total loss payments a marker is set against the vehicle record and the vehicle registration document is destroyed. 

'No further documents will be issued on such vehicles until a Vehicle Identity Check has been conducted to confirm the identity of the vehicle and have a current MoT if required.'

'There was a severe broadside impact to the offside of the vehicle,' he said.

'The consequence of a previous sub-standard repair undoubtedly caused greater intrusion of the side panel.

'Inadequate welding had been done to reinstate the quarter panel.

'There is an increased likelihood of the occupants sustaining greater injury, although I do not know by how much.'

Seven people, including two of Sadie’s cousins, were injured in the two car crash on the A548 in the village of Gwespyr, North Wales.

The girls’ grieving parents  kept a round-the-clock vigil at Sadie's sister's bedside while she lay in intensive care.

North Wales coroner John Gittins has said he will now write to vehicle and insurance associations - including the DVLA - asking for changes in the rules governing previously written off vehicles. 

Williams Sayner, of the North Wales Police Forensic Collision Investigation Unit, confirmed there are currently no statutory requirements regarding secondary testing of a car after it has been repaired following a write-off.

He also confirmed the manner and speed of driving of the man at the wheel of the Ford Focus 'cannot be considered blameworthy in any way'.

Speaking to the family, Mr Gittins said: 'Sadie was the light of your life. I am very conscious of your suffering.'

Evaluating post-mortem evidence he said Sadie’s death had resulted from 'a blunt force head injury as a result of a traffic collision'. 

He recorded a verdict of accidental death.
