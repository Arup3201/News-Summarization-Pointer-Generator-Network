Tragic: Pregnant mother of four Sarah Harkins of Fredericksburg, Virgina died Monday following an allergic reaction to bee stings

A pregnant Virginia mother is dead and her husband left to care for their four children after bee stings brought about her untimely end.

Sarah Harkins, 32, lost consciousness Monday after a wasp nest was disturbed in her yard. Paramedics were soon able to revive her, but the tragedy continued when an aneurysm lingering in her brain dislodged during the trauma.

Harkins' husbamd Eric must now raise their four children, one of whom was born with Down Syndrome, on his own.

'I’m 
thankful to the medic for giving me and the kids that chance, bringing 
her back enough so we could say goodbye to her,' Eric told the Free 
Lance-Star.

The two met while on a mission trip when both attended a Catholic university in Ohio and married in 2005.

Their fifth child, a girl they'd named Cecilia Rachel, would have been born this winter. Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant.

'Her
 passing was so tough, because I love her so much. She’s a gift that was
 given from God, he knows that I needed her, and she was this amazing 
gift,' the grief stricken husband and father said.

Their
 youngest child Faustina, 1, was born with Down Syndrome. Relatives say 
they worry that the parenting will be too much for Eric.

'With
 Sarah gone, Eric is not equipped to do this by himself,' Sarah's 
brother Tom Schulzetenberg told NBC Washington. 'It's something that you
 never really prepare for. We're doing our best to hold each other up.'

Moments of hope: Sarah was 21 weeks pregnant and actually was able to be revived by paramedics

One
 way Eric's family, as well as one coworker, have helped is by raising 
funds for the children to one day get a 'faith-based education' among 
other pricey future needs.

'Sarah’s
 absence leaves a massive gap in the lives of these children,' a reads a
 message on their YouCaring.com fundraiser. 'Sarah’s husband Eric will 
need assistance in fulfilling his wife’s wishes for the children to have
 a faith-based education, continue on a wholesome and natural diet, and 
support a special needs child.'

As
 of Thursday, the YouCaring page had raised nearly $40,000. Another 
fundraiser on GoFundMe had done even better, having raised an 
astonishing $100,000 in just two days.

According to her obituary, Sarah is survived by her husband, Eric, their four children: Liam, 7, Analee, 5, Jude, 3, and Faustina, 1, her mother and father and six siblings.
