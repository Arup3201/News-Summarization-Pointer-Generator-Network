Mark Warburton described Brentford’s thrilling cup win over Dagenham as ‘embarrassing’.

Richard Lee saved two penalties to send Brentford into the second round of the Capital One Cup after a 12-goal thriller against their League Two opponents.

Lee denied Jack Conners and Ashley Chambers in the shootout as the Championship new boys were pushed all the way in the League Cup’s first 6-6 draw

But Warburton was far from impressed with what he saw, he said: ‘The players described that as embarrassing, disappointing and frustrating.

‘From a position of total dominance in the first half and we could have scored more to suddenly giving goals away.

‘There was a lot of poor defending and I have never seen a game like that before and I don't want to see another one like it again.

‘We have to be better than that and that is no disrespect to Dagenham, they showed fantastic character and must have fancied their chances at 6-5 up.’

Brentford raced into a two-goal lead inside 10 minutes thanks to a Stuart Dallas brace.

The Northern Ireland midfielder scored his first after sliding in at the far post, and his second from the edge of the box.

Ashley Hemmings crossed for George Porter to score as Dagenham pulled a goal back.

A tropical storm midway through the first half made playing conditions very difficult for both sides.

And it was Dagenham who struggled the most as Scott Doe and played a terrible back pass to O’Brien and Proschwitz nipped in to score his first goal for Brentford since joining from Hull in the summer.

But every time Dagenham looked like they were down and out they dragged themselves up. And on the stroke of half-time Ashley Chambers broke clear and lifted the ball over Lee to bring the home side back into the game.

Andre Boucaud then wrong-footed Lee from 25 yards with an excellent strike to draw the League Two side level at 3-3. 

Historic: The 6-6 scoreline at Victoria Park was the first-ever such result in the history of the competition

Brentford thought they had won when Alan Judge broke into the Dagenham box and pulled the ball across for Andre Gray to score from close range.

But with seconds remaining on the clock, Dagenham’s Hemmings scored a spectacular goal to send the game into extra time.

Brentford struck first in extra time through Moore, who capped off an impressive debut. But Dagenham never knew when they were beaten and Jamie Cureton levelled the game yet again.

Hemmings completed Dagenham’s incredible comeback with another shot from the edge of the area to make it 6-5, but Harlee Dean came to Brentford’s rescue in the dying minutes of extra time, heading home Jake Bidwell’s cross to send the game to penalties.

Lee went the right way to deny Conners and Chambers as Brentford scored all their spot-kicks to win 4-2.

And Warburton added: ‘Richard Lee proved what a good goalkeeper he is at penalties, he relishes that one-on-one situation and he did a great job for us.'
