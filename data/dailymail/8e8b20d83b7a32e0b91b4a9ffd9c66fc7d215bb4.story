A star-studded private memorial was held this afternoon for veteran CBS News reporter Bob Simon who was killed in a horrific car crash last week. 

Dozens of fellow broadcasters, writers and other prominent public figures gathered at the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan earlier today to say goodbye to the highly regarded 60 Minutes correspondent.

CNN presenter Anderson Cooper, PBS host Charlie Rose, former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw and ex-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly were among those invited to the service intended only for family and close friends.

News giant: Tom Brokaw, 75, praised Bob Simon as a wonderful professional friend 

New York City's former top cop Ray Kelly said Simon, whom he'd known since 1980, was a 'legend' and 'quite a guy'

Cooper eulogized the veteran journalist in a touching statement released a day after his tragic passing.

‘I dreamed of being, and still hope to be, a quarter of the writer that Bob Simon is and has been. ... Bob Simon was a legend, in my opinion,’ he said.

The New York Daily News reported that a team of six pallbearers carried the casket containing Simon's body into the palatial concert venue for the intimate memorial, which lasted about 90 minutes.

The well-respected newsman was eulogized by his 60 Minutes colleague Morley Safer, reporter Steve Kroft, CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager, his long-time producer Joel Bernstein and his daughter, Tanya Simon.

Tom Brokaw, 75, also paid tribute to Simon, whom he praised as a wonderful professional friend. 

'We both thought we were two of the luckiest guys you could possibly imagine because we got to race off and cover the things we always cared about,' the anchor said.

The ever-laconic New York City's former top cop Ray Kelly said Simon, whom he'd known since 1980, said Simon was a 'legend' and 'quite a guy.'

'He'll be missed,' he added. 

It was no coincidence that the famed New York City opera house was chosen as the venue for Simon's memorial service, as he was known as a life-long music lover and opera connoisseur.

The speeches at the memorial were interspersed with musical compositions that were among Simon's favorites, including Giuseppe Verdi's 'Ingemisco,' Richard Wagner's 'Liebestod,' and The Beatles classic 'Let It Be.' 

Simon, 73, died Wednesday in a devastating two-car collision on the West Side Highway.

Police said he suffered fatal injuries when he was thrown from the back to the front of a livery cab when the car careened out of control near 30th Street.

Simon is survived by his wife, Francoise, their daughter, Tanya, who is a producer for 60 Minutes, and his beloved grandson, Jack. At the time of his death, Simon was awating the arrival of his second grandchild.

At the conclusion of the service, Charlie Rose described the somber event for a group of reporters assembled outside as a tribute to 'a life lived well and lived around the world, and lived with courage and lived with a great sense of the human spirit.' 

Somber task: Tanya Simon, Bob Simon's daughter and one of the producers of 60 Minutes, over the weekend accompanied her mother to a funeral home to make preparations for his memorial service

Last sign-off: Bob Simon's final report for 60 Minutes about the search for an Ebola cure aired Sunday on CBS 

A larger public memorial service for Bob Simon will be held at a later date. 

60 Minutes remembered its longtime correspondent Sunday by airing a story he finished on the day he died, four days earlier. The story looked into a possible new treatment for the Ebola virus.

Following the report, fellow correspondent Steve Kroft spoke of Simon's 'sense of justice and his sense of the absurd,' both of which informed his journalism. Kroft said Simon was 'both a model and an inspiration' to his colleagues at CBS News during 47 years at the network. 

60 Minutes will devote its full hour next Sunday to Simon and his storied career.
