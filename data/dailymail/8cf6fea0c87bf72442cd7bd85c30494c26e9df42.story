Two of the most successful food brands in recent years are to part company, as Whole Foods Market announced it is to stop stocking Chobani early next year.

As Whole Foods moves towards more organic and GMO-free produce, it has decided to no longer offer the popular Greek yogurt.

With more organic versions now available, Chobani, which uses milk from cows fed with GMO food, appears to be less in line with the store's philosophy.

Fresh approach: Whole Foods says it will no longer stock Chobani as it moves towards more organic Greek yogurt options

'Whole Foods Market challenged its 
Greek yogurt suppliers to create unique options for shoppers to enjoy -
 including exclusive flavors, non-GMO options and organic choices,' the store said in a statement.

It added that Chobani, which produces 30 million cups of yogurt a week, had 'chosen a different business model' meaning it will be phased out early next year 'to make room for product choices that aren't readily available'.

Kevin Perkins, a Morningstar analyst, told ABC: 'As consumers spend more money with a 
handful of retailers, these retailers have more leverage to lean on 
suppliers for lower prices, different packaging. This may be one 
such example.'

Being stocked by Whole Foods was just part of Chobani's success story as the company, founded by a Turkish immigrant, quickly rose to become a billion-dollar industry.

'They have been a wonderful and an 
important partner of ours over the years,' the company, run by Hamdi Ulukaya, said.

Taste of success: Chobani was started by a Turkish immigrant in 2005 who wanted to offer nutritious and easily accessible yogurt

'As the number one Greek yogurt brand in America using only natural 
ingredients, we share an affinity with Whole Foods and its shoppers,' the statement said.

While none of the non-dairy ingredients in Chobani have been genetically modified, it is hard for the company, and others like it, to find animal feed that is GMO free.

In July the company said it would be a challenge to find an economical and GMO-free way to feed the more than 78,000 cows kept at 875 farms around its plants.

More than 90 per cent of the soy and corn grown in the U.S. and used for animal feeds come from genetically engineered seeds.

However, with Chobani keen for its product to be available to the masses, being dropped by Whole Foods, which has about 360 stores in the U.S. and UK, won't be too big a set back.

Mr Ulukaya told the New York Times: 'The foundation of my business model and my philosophy is that we are going to make yogurt that is delicious, nutritious and accessible to everyone.'

The immigrant, who came up with the idea of Chobani in 2005, added: 'When
 I came here I couldnâ€™t understand why in order to find good-tasting 
yogurt you have to go to some specialty store to find it.'
