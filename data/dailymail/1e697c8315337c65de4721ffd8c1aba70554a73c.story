Roberto Martinez says Ross Barkley's return to training has been 'infectious' and that the Everton midfielder is close to making his first appearance this season.

The England international was ruled out for  eight weeks after suffering knee-ligament damage in August, but the 20-year-old trained with his team-mates on Monday.

Everton manager Martinez  cannot tell whether Barkley will play against Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday, but says his reaction to training has been encouraging.

'It's really close. He's had a very good period of work now,' Martinez said. 

'He came back on Monday with the group, and he's reacted extremely well. Sometimes you forget what a sensational footballer he is and when you see him at full flow you realise it's a bit infectious around the players.

'He's desperate to play. His work this week has been very, very good. 

'It's too early to tell whether he's going to be involved on Saturday but I don't see him being too far away from it.'

Martinez added  Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Steven Pienaar are recovering well, and checks would be made to see if they can play against Aston Villa or  Lille in the Europa League five days later.

'James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar are very close to being available to be travelling with the squad,' added Martinez. 

'It's early for the weekend. If it's not the weekend, then I will expect them to be available for the Europa League game.

'John Stones had his surgery on Monday and it was a very successful operation. Now we start to look at counting the days until he is fully fit again.

'Kevin Mirallas is recovering well but has a little bit of a longer period.'
