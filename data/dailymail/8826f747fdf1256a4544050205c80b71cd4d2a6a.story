Charmaine Kember, 35, experienced painful varicose veins in her legs which then appeared in her vagina

As
 a doting mother of four, Charmaine Kember loves being at the centre of 
family life. But becoming a mother has cost her health - and 
self-confidence - dearly.

Charmaine, 35, enjoyed trouble-free 
pregnancies with her first two children Sean, now 15, and daughter 
Aimee, now 12. 'I loved being pregnant and wanted a big family,' she 
recalls.

When she and partner Lee, 35, a salesman, found out they were expecting a third child, they were thrilled.

'I
 had the usual stretch marks after being pregnant twice before,' recalls
 Charmaine, from Gillingham, Kent. 'So when they started popping up 
again, I didn't mind.'

But when she was around 14 weeks pregnant she 
noticed large, blue veins on her legs - they began in clusters around 
her ankles then spread further up.

'I'd joke to Lee about adding varicose veins to my pregnancy battle scars,' she remembers.Varicose
 veins develop when the veins stretch and the valves inside them, which 
prevent blood flowing the wrong way, fail to work. Blood pools in the 
veins, causing them to become swollen, enlarged and painful.

They are
 common in pregnancy as hormones relax the walls of the veins and more 
blood is produced to support the growing baby, putting strain on the 
veins.

As her pregnancy progressed, Charmaine noticed more and more unsightly, dark blue veins on her legs.

'They began to look like road maps,' she says. 'I had to cover up with trousers or maxi skirts. I felt awful.'

Then one night when she was 20 weeks pregnant, she felt a hard, lumpy vein in her vaginal area while bathing.

'I
 realised in horror what it was,' she says. 'I couldn't see it, but it 
was a varicose vein - just like the huge ones on my legs.'

The following day, she felt another one, then another, and they started causing great discomfort.

'I
 told my midwife about the veins in my legs and she said they were 
normal in pregnancy. Then I told her about the ones I'd found down 
there.'

After an examination the midwife confirmed it was varicose 
veins, or vaginal varicosities. Charmaine was referred to a consultant 
gynaecologist, who said they'd probably diminish after the birth.

Charmaine's varicose veins got so bad she had to walk on crutches

The
 consultant explained that varicose veins in intimate areas affected 
around one in ten pregnant women - they are caused when blood pools 
inside the pelvic veins deeper inside the body.

'I was amazed - I'd 
never read anything about this, or even heard anyone talk about it 
before,' says Charmaine. 'I wondered how many other women were hobbling 
around like me, mortified.'

In fact, vaginal (or vulval) varicose 
veins become more common with each pregnancy a woman has, explains Dr 
Katrina Erskine, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Homerton 
Hospital, London. 'They occur both in the vagina and in the vulva. 
They are the same as varicose veins in the leg; they lead to swelling, 
and are rather uncomfortable.

'They are caused by the baby sitting 
on the large blood vessels that drain blood from your legs, causing back
 pressure, and hence the veins widen.'

Professor Mark Whiteley, 
consultant surgeon and clinical director of The Whiteley Clinic, thinks 
the condition could be more common than doctors realise.

According to
 his research, one in five women who've had a previous vaginal delivery 
and suffers with varicose veins of the legs, also has varicose veins in 
the pelvis and vaginal area.

'Fortunately, in most patients, the veins are either relatively small or deep, so most ladies are not aware they have them.'

He
 explains that pregnancy hormones that prepare a woman's body for labour
 and an increase in the volume of blood mean these vulval and vaginal 
varicose veins can be seen more easily. 'After pregnancy, once the 
hormones and blood volume return to normal, the veins shrink and in some
 people appear to have completely gone.

'However, with specialised 
transvaginal scans we can see if the varicose veins in the pelvis or 
vagina are still there. They can contribute to varicose veins in the 
legs.'

But Professor Whiteley adds that because it is not easy to get
 a clear picture of the female pelvis from standard scans, often women 
are told they are imagining the problem.

Yet these veins can have a depressingly real effect.

As
 Professor Whiteley explains: 'Women can suffer symptoms such as 
dragging pain, discomfort during sexual intercourse, and irritable 
bladder. This is due to the weight of the varicose veins in the pelvis 
pushing on these organs.'

The medical term for this is pelvic congestion syndrome.

Charmaine has been told they won't go away and there is nothing more she can do

Charmaine's veins continued growing during her pregnancy - both in size and quantity - along with her discomfort.

'It
 began as being uncomfortable, then progressed to severe pain - soon I 
could barely walk and needed crutches because the veins made my legs 
swell so much it hurt to move.

'I was so embarrassed. I didn't let 
Lee anywhere near me and worried how our sex life would be after the 
birth. It was bad enough having unsightly veins on my legs, let alone 
there.

'I didn't tell my friends. Most pregnant women compare stretch
 marks or bumps. How could I discuss what I had going on down below?' 
Charmaine's daughter, Annabelle, now five, was delivered by emergency 
Caesarean, and she was hopeful the veins would soon go.

But six 
months later, the veins on her legs were as large and blue as before. 
The vaginal veins diminished a little over time, but remained very 
uncomfortable. Her GP said there was nothing anyone could do.

Two years later, Charmaine was pregnant again. But her joy was tempered by the fear that the veins would worsen.

Sure enough, at ten weeks the hard blue veins started appearing again - new ones as well as the existing veins.

'The
 midwife gave me stockings, to support the veins in the legs, but there 
was nothing I could do about the others,' she says. 'I was in agony.'

Because of her pregnancy, Charmaine couldn't take strong pain relief. 'I just had to put up with it,' she says.

As the weeks passed, more and more veins appeared and she again had difficulty walking, ending up on crutches.

'My legs were like something from a horror film,' she says. 'I felt like a freak.'

As for a romantic life with Lee, 'it would have been too uncomfortable and embarrassing' .

With
 the birth of their son Teddy, now 17 months, 'we had our complete 
family - two boys, two girls', says Charmaine. 'But it had come at a 
cost. My veins didn't go in the weeks after Teddy's birth. I knew they 
never would.'

Charmaine has been told they won't go away and there is nothing more she can do.

But Professor Whiteley says this information is wrong.

'It
 is amazing how few gynaecologists, GPs and nurses know there is 
treatment available,' he says.

The number of adults who are affected by varicose veins

'What these women need is a specialist 
transvaginal duplex scan, which shows exactly which veins in the pelvis 
are causing the problem. Once they are known, little metal coils can be 
placed inside these veins which then completely shrivel away.'

Professor
 Whiteley believes treating the veins would help the varicose veins in 
the legs. 'Our research, about to be published in the journal of 
Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatics, suggests failure to treat these
 veins is a major reason why leg varicose veins come back after 
treatment in up to a third of women.'

Unfortunately, this specialist 
treatment is not widely available.

Charmaine herself is pragmatic 
about her situation. 'It was a nasty thing to go through but is a small 
price to pay for our lovely family.'Â
