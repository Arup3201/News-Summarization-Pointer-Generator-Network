Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into claims police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to uncover journalists’ sources

Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into claims police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to uncover journalists’ sources.

Home Office officials will examine how the powers are being used amid widespread concerns officers are bypassing legal protections designed to safeguard whistle-blowers.

The surveillance watchdog also launched an inquiry yesterday. Sir Paul Kennedy, Interception of Communications Commissioner, is to require all police forces to reveal the extent of their use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) against journalists.

Sir Paul said he shared the concerns about protecting sources.

The Home Office will look at police use of Ripa in relation to journalists as part of a wider review of the powers available under the Act to the police and Security Services which was announced earlier this year.

Since then, two police forces have been found using the powers to obtain journalists’ phone records and work out who they were speaking to.

A Home Office source said last night: ‘The last thing we want is for Ripa to be used to circumvent laws protecting journalists’ sources or undermining journalistic methods and practices.’

Last month it emerged that the Metropolitan Police used Ripa powers to obtain telephone records from The Sun newspaper’s newsdesk and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn as part of the Plebgate inquiry.

The records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims Andrew Mitchell, the then chief whip, described officers as ‘plebs’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of Downing Street.

Then, last week, it emerged police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the Mail on Sunday – the Daily Mail’s sister paper - and one of his sources for the story, even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential.

Kent Police also used Ripa to find out who spoke to David Dillon, the Mail on Sunday news editor working on the story, and his source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who was given the story by Constance Briscoe.

The former judge was arrested after police discovered she lied to officers by claiming she had not discussed the case with any reporters.

The Guardian media commentator Roy Greenslade has likened officers’ actions in such cases to those of a ‘police state’.

Ripa requires only that the request be approved by a police officer of Superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants.

It is claimed officers used Ripa because other laws governing their investigations require officers to go before a judge to make the case for seizing journalistic material.

Announcing his inquiry, Sir Paul said: ‘I fully understand and share the concerns raised about the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press.’

He has been deluged with more than 1,000 complaints since details of Scotland Yard’s actions in relation to The Sun became public.

The 'RIPA' powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval and were used in the Plebgate affair involving former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell (above)

Scotland Yard used snooping powers – contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist Tom Newton Dunn's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair

He said his office would report all findings to the Prime Minister, and publicly, to develop ‘clarity in relation to the scope and compliance of this activity’.

The Sun made an official complaint about the Met’s actions, and has called for a public hearing at the Investigatory PowersTribunal into the way the Met accessed its journalists’ records.

The newspaper’s managing editor Stig Abell said the use of Ripa posed a ‘really serious risk to the freedom of the press’.

He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ‘If you are going to seek to access information about journalists’ sources you should be doing it in front of a judge, where the publisher or the broadcaster or the journalist themselves can make an argument and be aware of what is going on.

‘What we have learned over the last few weeks is that it is potentially the case that police forces across the country have the ability, through merely the permission of a superintendent, to access the phone records of journalists and thereby identify sources.’
