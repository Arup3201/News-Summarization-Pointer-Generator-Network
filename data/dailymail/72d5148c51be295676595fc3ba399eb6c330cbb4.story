Liverpool go head to head with Swansea City in the Capital One Cup fourth round at Anfield. The competition provides former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers with a great opportunity to win his first piece of silverware since taking charge of Liverpool in 2012.

The Reds will be wary of a Swansea side that currently sit ahead of them in the Barclays Premier League on goal difference. 

Rodgers will know doubt remember the last time these two sides met in the fourth round of the Captial One Cup, with it being the first game he'd played against Swansea as Liverpool boss. A 3-1 loss to Swansea then should be enough warning that Liverpool cannot expect to cruise to victory.

Team news

Liverpool 

It remains to be seen whether Mario Balotelli keeps his place when Liverpool rotate their players for Tuesday's Capital One Cup fourth-round clash with Swansea at Anfield.

Reds assistant boss Colin Pascoe has confirmed changes will be made, but was giving little away on the chances of Balotelli being in the team. There could be another start for Rickie Lambert, who played in the third-round victory over Middlesbrough, as well as further game time for teenagers Jordan Rossiter and Jordan Williams, both of whom also featured in that win.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Moreno, Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Lallana, Balotelli, Sterling, Jones, Manquillo, Toure, Enrique, Can, Markovic, Lucas, Coutinho, Lambert, Borini, Suso, Rossiter, Williams.

Swansea

Garry Monk is expected to name a strong Swansea side as he prepares to renew acquaintances with his former manager Brendan Rodgers in the fourth round of the Capital One Cup at Liverpool on Tuesday night.

Gerhard Tremmel has started Swansea's two previous League Cup ties this season and is likely to replace Lukasz Fabianski in goal, but Monk seems set to keep changes to a minimum as the Welsh club look to repeat their Anfield win at the same stage of the competition two years ago.

But Gylfi Sigurdsson, who limped off during the second half of the 2-0 Premier League home victory against Leicester on Saturday, and Wayne Routledge could be handed breathers after their heavy workloads so far this term.

Provisional squad: Tremmel, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Carroll, Montero, Dyer, Gomis, Bony, Fabianski, Shephard, Bartley, Sigurdsson, Routledge, Emnes, Fulton, King, Kingsley.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Brendan Rodgers won three of his five matches in the League Cup as Swansea manager (60%); he has won just two of five for Liverpool so far (40%).

Swansea have only won two of their 19 trips to Anfield in all competitions (D3 L14), but the most recent win was at this stage of the League Cup in October 2012 (the year they went on to win the competition).

Liverpool's third round victory over Middlesbrough featured the highest scoring penalty shootout in League Cup history (14-13); Raheem Sterling was the only player to miss for the Reds.

The Reds have not beaten a Premier League side in the League Cup at Anfield since October 2006 (4-3 v Reading).

Swansea have only made it past the fourth round of this competition once in their history, but that was when they lifted the trophy in 2012/13.

The Swans are unbeaten in four League Cup games against fellow Premier League sides (W3 D1).
