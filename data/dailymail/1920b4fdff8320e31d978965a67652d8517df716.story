Never come between a man and his food - especially when that man is the heavyweight champion of the world.

For when boxer Shannon Briggs barged in on Wladimir Klitschko's meal, it ended in humiliating fashion - with a glass of water over the head. 

Klitschko, 38, was tucking in to a bowl of food at an Italian restaurant in Miami, Florida when Briggs, who hopes to take on the Ukrainian in a title fight, arrived uninvited.

The 42-year-old was then filmed saying: 'What's up champ? I told you champ, wherever you go I go, champ. What you do I do, champ. I train champ, you train champ. Let’s fight, champ.

In video footage of the incident, taken by an onlooker at the restaurant, Briggs then sits down opposite the current WBA, IBF, WBO, IBO champion before grabbing his food and eating some of it.

'What you eat I eat,' he is heard saying as he starts to eat Klitschko's food.

'I told you, everything you do I do. Thanks, champ.'

At first, Klitschko appears calm and starts to pour himself some water. But seconds later, he can be seen tipping the contents over his rival's head, sparking chaotic scenes.

Briggs then appears to knock the glass from his hand before knocking the food from the table, shouting: 'You pour water on my head? You pour water on my head?'

A large man can then be seen arriving and grabbing Briggs, pushing him out of the restaurant.

In the struggle, Briggs loses his footing and slips over while his would-be opponent in the ring looks at his hand as if it had been injured during the clash.

According to Fightnews.com, Briggs suffered a cut hand and foot.

It was the second time in a fortnight that Briggs had confronted Klitschko. He recently squared up to the Ukrainian while he was at a gym in South Florida and challenged him to a fight. 

In April, Briggs crashed into a news conference involving Vladimir Klitschko demanding a title bout.

Not only is Klitschko heralded for his fighting, he's got his own collection of famous friends and family in tow. 

Klitschko is engaged to Hollywood actress, model, and singer Hayden Panettiere. Rumor has it that the couple of two years has a baby on the way.

The 24-year-old blonde Nashville star flashed her baby bump on vacation in Sardinia in late June.

Another little known fact is that Klitschko comes from a political family and his brother Vitali Klitschko is a Ukranian politiciant and the current mayor of Kiev.

Like his brother, Vitali was once a heavyweight champion and he holds the second best knockout-to-fight ratio of any champion in heavyweight boxing history.
