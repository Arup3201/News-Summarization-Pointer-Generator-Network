Among the reaction and criticism of Apple's latest iPhone event, one feature that many experts agree on is that its upcoming iOS 7 software is a game changer - in the way it looks and the way its new features will 'revitalise' older models.

Current iPhone 5 and 4 owners, plus people with the iPad 2 and iPad Mini, can get the new software from 18 September, which means all devices released since 2010 will benefit from the release.

The software has been in beta since Brit designer Sir Jonathan Ive unveiled its flatter look in June, and despite the visual changes being initially met with hostility, experts who have installed and used the operating system have been raving about it, with one classing it as 'incredible.'

Apple's iOS 7 software includes a new feature called Airdrop that lets users share photos, video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow iOS 7 user from a contacts list

Michael Liedtke from Associated Press said: 'One of the best things about Apple's latest iPhones is the slick new iOS 7 software that runs the devices.

'But that souped-up operating system could end up hurting sales because the free software upgrade will also work on iPhones released since 2010, giving owners of the older models less incentive to buy Apple's newest products.'

He continues that even Apple's software boss, Craig Federighi predicts that anyone installing iOS 7 will feel 'like they're getting an all-new device.'

James Chandler, head of mobile at media agency Mindshare UK told MailOnline: 'I've had iOS 7 on my iPhone 5 for the last three months and have to say that it's incredible - it is literally like getting a whole new device.

'Airdrop, quick access menu and the way photos are organised by location, event and time make for a brilliant new user experience.'

The new Apple Control Center can be accessed from any screen in iOS 7, including the Lock Screen. It lets users quickly access settings, change their handset's brightness level, control playback and access AirPlay

Individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double-clicking the 'home' button and swiping up in iOS 7

Airdrop is a brand new feature to iPhone that lets users share photos, video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow iOS 7 user from a contacts list.

A similar feature is already available for Mac computers.

All transfers are encrypted and items can be sent using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

The quick access menu is called the Notification Centre and it has been revamped to show the most relevant information.

It shows new mail, missed calls and other notifications, but iOS 7 additionally has a feature called Today that gives an at-a-glance look at the day ahead. The menu can also now be opened while the screen is locked.

It shows live weather and traffic information, for example, updated in real-time as well as birthdays or upcoming events. 

In addition to the Notification Centre, iOS 7 has a Control Centre that can be opened by swiping from the bottom of the screen and lets the user quickly access the Wi-Fi and network mode settings, change the screen's brightness and play or stop music.

The Control Centre looks similar to the Notifcation Menu on the latest versions of Android Jelly Bean.

Individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double-clicking the 'home' button and swiping up in iOS 7.

Apple's
 updated photo feature has added Years, Collections, and Moments that 
groups images and videos together based on when and where they were 
taken.

When taking shots, budding 
photographers can also now focus using the volume down key on the side 
of the handset, while the volume up button takes the picture.

The new iTunes Radio streaming service, pictured will only be available to U.S phones when it launches. It lets users stream radio stations on and create playlists

The Compass app, found in the Utilities folder in iOS 6, now includes a spirit level.

Apple has also added built-in a torch feature that uses the phone's flash, removing the need to install torch apps.

The firm has additionally made password manager apps redundant by introducing an encrypted folder that can automatically store multiple account logins and passwords.

It can save credit card details using its iCloud storage service, too.

Similar to how LastPass works, the software can automatically fill forms with names, addresses and personal details to save time at the checkout, for example.

Because these passwords use iCloud, the details can be synced across other iOS 7 devices.

Additional new iOS 7 features include a Find My iPhone Activation Lock, that asks for an Apple ID and a password before the feature can be disabled.

This means if a phone is stolen, the thief can't stop the original owner from being able to locate it. It will also prevent people from deleting data from the handset.

Apple has also added the Popular Apps Near Me feature that personalise which apps appear when a user opens the App Store, based on the current location.

Not all the features of iOS 7 will be available to older handsets because some require the iPhone 5S' fingerprint scanner, for example, while others work best on the high-end model's faster 64-bit chip. 

The new iTunes Radio streaming service will only be available to U.S phones when it launches on the same day as iOS 7.

Apple's updated photo feature has added Years, Collections, and Moments that groups images and videos together based on when and where they were taken. Each year holds Collections and Moments are shown in each Collection

It lets users stream radio stations on their iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and create playlists based on genres or artists.

The service will work in a similar way to Last.fm's 'scrobbling' feature that personalises radio stations based on past listening history.

A UK release date has not been confirmed, although it is likely to be dependent on agreements from record labels.

Speaking at Wednesday's launch Federighi said:'iOS 7 is completely redesigned with an entirely new user interface and over 200 new features, so it’s like getting a brand new device, but one that will still be instantly familiar to our users.'

He added that Apple has shipped 700 million iOS devices and 94 per cent of users are running the most recent software, iOS 6, with predictions that the majority will download the seventh-generation system when it launches next week.
