A Florida man has earned his place in the shoplifting hall of fame after he successfully stole a chainsaw from a hardware store by sticking the power tool down his pants.

Anthony Ballard, of Port Lucie, Florida, walked into Treasure Coast Lawn Equipment, asked the cashier if he had change for a dollar, and then jammed a chainsaw down his drawers.

The device was off at the time.

Snagged: Anthony Ballard (above) was arrested after he got caught shoplifting a chainsaw by sticking the device down his pants and walking out of the store

Step 1: Grab the chainsaw while no one is looking

Step 2: Jam the chainsaw down the front of your pants

Step 3: Cover it up with your shirt and head for the door

Even more impressive, Ballard then hopped a bike and sped off.

Sadly for Ballard, workers did notice the man with a $600 piece of semi-heavy machinery protruding from his slacks trying to make his way out of the store, and chased after him.

But Ballard, a man who is chock-full of great ideas, had one more trick up his sleeve and tossed the chainsaw into a wooded area before cycling off.

He then came back about 40 minutes later according to the TC Palm to retrieve his stolen merchandise.

Hold up now: An employee gets up almost immediately as Ballard makes his way to the exit and then his getaway bicycle 

Unfortunately for Ballard, 28, employees knew the chainsaw had been tossed in the wooded area, and when they saw Ballard snooping around for it, they called the authorities.

Ballard was arrested and has now been charged with grand theft.

According to the police report, Ballard says he was actually getting the chainsaw to return it to the store, having had a change of heart about stealing the pricey power tool.

He did not say if he planned on carrying it back in or sticking it down his pants again.
