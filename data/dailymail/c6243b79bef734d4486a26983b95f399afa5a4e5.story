A married huntmaster has been cleared of shooting his showjumper ex-lover.

Brian Fraser, 63, was today found not guilty of the attempted murder of Louise Leggatt, 55, and also of causing her grievous bodily harm with intent.

The master of the Ashford Valley Hunt in Kent was alleged to have been enraged at the end of his five-year romance with Miss Leggatt – who the court heard was known as ‘Leg-Over Leggatt’.

The verdicts came after a jury spent five and a half hours deliberating, following a two-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court.

Fraser had admitted possessing a firearm without a licence and was warned by the judge he could still be sent to prison.

Judge Charles Byers said: ‘I have never come across such a lackadaisical
and irresponsible attitude towards firearms, particularly for someone 
who is described as a countryman.’

He bailed him to return to court on March 18 to be sentenced.

The judge also told Fraser not to have any contact with Miss Leggatt or 
her two grown-up sons, Ben and William, saying: ‘I am considering a 
restraining order which even in the face of an acquittal I can make.’

Mrs Leggatt was shot as she went to tend to her horses at her farmhouse home in Benenden, Kent, in March last year

Mr Fraser showed no emotion as the verdicts were delivered but there were cheers and cries of 'Yes' from his family and friends in the public gallery, including his forgiving wife Nanette who looked tearful.

Leaving the court after the verdict, Mrs Fraser said: 'There's a lot I could say. I'm just relieved it's all over and we can get back to living together.'

Mrs Leggatt, who was in court, held her head in her hands and looked shattered.

She was shot outside her secluded rented farmhouse home in Benenden, Kent, in March last year, as she went to tend her horses.

She suffered shotgun injuries to her pelvis and leg, and underwent surgery to remove some of the pellets.

Two months earlier, Mrs Leggatt's home, The Pippins, was destroyed in an arson attack, forcing her to rent the next door property Bramleys, where she was shot.

Nobody was ever convicted for the arson.

Mr Fraser and Mrs Leggatt met through the Ashford Valley Hunt in Kent in 2000 and became lovers in 2001.

Brian Fraser moved into the home of Louise Leggatt (above) and they had a five-year affair before he returned to his wife of 26 years in October 2011, at their farm in Shadoxhurst near Ashford, Kent

He moved into her home and they had a five-year affair before Fraser returned to his wife of 26 years in October 2011, at their farm in Shadoxhurst near Ashford, Kent.

Mr Fraser denied he tried to rekindle their romance and was angry when she rejected him.

Giving evidence during the trial, twice-divorced Mrs Leggatt sobbed as she relived the 'terrifying' moment she was shot in her front garden by a hidden gunman.

She said: 'First of all, I heard a sound and then I just had the most horrendous pain in my leg and hip.

'I couldn't use my right leg at all but I managed to get inside and drag myself across the floor to where the phone was to dial 999.

'I was absolutely terrified, I had never been so terrified in all my life. I was really, really scared that whoever had done this was going to come back in and I couldn't get back to the door to lock the door.'

During the trial, one of Louise's ex-husbands, Philip Gorringe, admitted he had heard of her being referred to as 'Leg-Over Leggatt' in hunting circles.

Mr Fraser declined to comment following the case.

His solicitor Toby Burrough said outside court: 'Mr Fraser has always maintained his innocence in respect of the charges he faced, and is thankful to the jury for reaching the verdict they did, and is obviously tremendously relieved at the outcome today.

'He would like to thank all those who stood by him and supported him throughout this case. It has been a tremendously stressful occasion for both him and his family.

'It has been a difficult time for him and his family and those who have supported him because of the serious nature of the allegations he faced.

'And that has been something that has taken its toll on him.... it is a great weight off his shoulders.'
