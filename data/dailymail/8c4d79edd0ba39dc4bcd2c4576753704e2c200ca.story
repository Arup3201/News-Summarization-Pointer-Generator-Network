Eric Dier has taken to life on the pitch in the Premier League with ease since he joined Tottenham from Sporting Lisbon in the summer.

But some English ways have taken the 20-year-old centre-half by surprise - such as having to set the clocks back every October.

Though he was born in Cheltenham, Dier moved to Portugal at the age of eight and remained there until Spurs paid £4m to bring him to London in August.

So despite being an England Under 21 international, Dier has had a crash course education in English life over the last few weeks.

He told The Sun on Sunday: 'I was very young when I went to Portugal and don't remember anything about living here previously. All I remember from childhood is living in Portugal.

'Living here feels very strange. I feel like I am in a new country.

'I didn't even know the clocks were going back until a secretary at the club told me on Thursday. She told me that it will get dark here at about 4pm. I didn't know that.

'They don't do that in Portugal. I thought she was having me on at first. Nobody told me that when I signed!'

It can only be hoped as winter descends that Dier finds his way to White Hart Lane in time for Sunday's 1.30pm kick-off with Newcastle United.

But there have been no such problems on the pitch, with Dier starting nine matches for Spurs this season in the Premier League and the Europa League.

He admits England's top flight is a step up from Portugal's but is well equipped to cope.

'Teams counter very quickly against us,' he said. 'So you have to get used to having long spells of possession and then reacting really quickly when you lose the ball.

'So you have to be switched on at all times, otherwise you can get caught out.'

Tottenham have been caught out on a few occasions so far this season but sit 10th in the standings ahead of Newcastle's visit.
