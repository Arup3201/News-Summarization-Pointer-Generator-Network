Aaron Smith has been held up at gunpoint by a gang member in Rio de Janeiro, went through a brutal tribal initiation in the Amazonian jungle and spent 24 hours with former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel.

From Thursday Island, located in the Torres Stair Islands in far- north Queensland, he travelled through South America from 2006 to 2009, exploring everything the country had to offer from its night life to witch doctors and its hallucinogenic drinks.

He has now penned a book about his outrageous adventures called 'Chasing El Dorado, A South American Adventure'.

Raised as a 'strict atheist', Mr Smith - who is now the editor of a weekly Torres Strait newspaper in Queensland - landed in Brazil and then went onto to Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador and Colombia.

He said the trip changed his life and turned him into a 'squirmish agnostic'.

During his time in Rio, Mr Smith, 44, had a near-death experience where he was held up at gunpoint in a gang-operated neighbourhood on his first night in town.

It was also the same night he met his future wife, Viviane, who took him out for an 'authentic' night out in the Brazilian city.

The Queensland man, pictured swinging through the trees at the Ayahuasca retreat in Peru, said his trip which spanned from 2006-2009 changed his life

He took a trip down the Ucayali River with Matse Indians, a semi-nomadic Indian group that are spread through the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon

'She took me to a Samba school to go dancing and we were drinking and the urge to take a p*** came along,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

'I walked into the ghetto [trying to find a toilet] - which controlled by gangs - it's even off limits to police let alone a drunk.

'I had a young man point a large machine gun at me. He was 12 or 13, he could barely lift the gun.

'Within minutes, Viviane realised I had gone down the wrong way and came after me. 

'She convinced them not to execute me on the spot, which is not uncommon there, and I thought she was a keeper on the spot. 

'There’s nothing scarier than a man with gun, other than a boy with a gun.'

But strangely, Mr Smith's Rio experience would not be the most surreal of his trip.

Las Huaringas Lake in Peru was also paid a visit by Mr Smith during his adventures

The journalist ended up in the middle of the Amazonian jungle where he went through an ancient tribal ritual which involved him being burned with a hot stick on his chest, before he had monkey tree frog poison rubbed into the wounds.

Monkey tree frogs produce a defensive substance that is harnessed by Indian tribes in the Amazon to use in blow darts or to improve their senses for hunting due to the poison's hallucinogenic properties.

'It basically shut downs central nervous system. You get tunnel vision, you get chronic vertigo and lose your balance that was within first 30 seconds,' he said. 

'You just throw up until you throw up bile. You feel like you're basically dying.

'If survive that, then you become a Matses warrior.'

Another highlight of the adventurer's trip was meeting music legend Peter Gabriel in the Peruvian city of Iquitos

Another highlight of the trip was meeting former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel in the Peruvian city of Iquitos and spent 24 hours with him, his daughter, band and entourage.

Mr Smith said the music legend was surprisingly down-to-earth and 'approachable'.

'I got tipped off by a hotel manage that [Peter Gabriel] was coming to Iquitos,' he said.

'It's funny because before I met him, the hotel manager showed me a 10-page contract, which gave me the impression [Gabriel] was a prima donna.

'I positioned myself where I knew he would walk passed and he sat next to me and stuck out his hand and said: "Hi, my name's Peter", so he was very approachable.'

Mr Smith describes his book, 'Chasing El Dorado, A South American Adventure', as an 'an existential road trip, a gonzo travelogue and a continental love story'.

The book is published by Transit Lounge and is available online. 

Mr Smith's book detailing his escapades around South America is available online now
