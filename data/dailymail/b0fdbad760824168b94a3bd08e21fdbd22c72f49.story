A restored 400-year-old barn on Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s River Cottage farm has been destroyed by a fire thought to have started in a kitchen.

The building is used for cookery courses run by the millionaire chef’s company and has been the scene of ‘feasts’ filmed for his Channel 4 television series.

Last night, Fearnley-Whittingstall was said to be unaware of the destruction as he is away filming for another of his programmes, Hugh’s Fish Fight, about sustainable fishing.

Firefighters were on the scene investigating the cause of the fire today. Each of the individual cookers in the barn had its own gas cylinder

‘He is on a boat 8,000 miles away in 
the middle of the ocean somewhere and only contactable via satellite 
phone,’ a spokesman said. ‘He will be informed as soon as he can be 
contacted.’

Eight fire engines and 80 firefighters
 spent three hours tackling the blaze at the 66-acre River Cottage Park 
Farm near Axminster, Devon. A gardener, who lives in part of the large 
farmhouse opposite, raised the alarm at around 10pm on Tuesday.

Investigators are not treating the blaze as suspicious. Nobody was in the barn at the time and no people or animals were hurt.

Before: The River Cottage barn is home to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's cookery school. Staff said that anyone booked on a course will be contacted as soon as possible

Destroyed: The floor and work surfaces are covered in tiles from the roof. Pots and pans are blackened and the rest of the kitchen completely gutted

Damage to the single-storey building 
is thought to run into tens of thousands of pounds. Yesterday the 
remains of rows of gas ovens and burnt-out pots and pans could be seen 
among the charred debris.

The former threshing barn was restored
 six years ago and is regarded by Fearnley-Whittingstall’s team as ‘the 
heart of River Cottage HQ’, his spokesman said.

Staff were said to be ‘shocked and 
upset’ by the fire. They said the building was used for £230-a-day 
cookery courses and as a venue for celebrations. It could also be booked
 for private functions.

Wrecked: The kitchens may have to be pulled down following the blaze. The cause is not thought to be suspicious

Blaze: Two firefighters work on the scene this morning as an investigation into the cause of the blaze gets underway

Fearnley-Whittingstall, 47, who is due
 back in England at the end of the month, lives with his wife Marie and 
their four children in another farmhouse less than 20 miles away.

Yesterday budding chefs who were due 
to attend courses in the barn were advised to stay at home, while those 
already in the area were offered free breakfasts. A River Cottage 
spokesman said: ‘Cookery school courses at Park Farm will not be running
 in the short term, and anyone booked on a course will be contacted by 
the River Cottage events team as soon as possible.’

Celebrity chef: Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall had this morning not been informed about the blaze as he is away filming

A message posted on Twitter yesterday 
by the River Cottage team expressed thanks to the fire service, saying: 
‘River Cottage sausage rolls all round for the crews, who were terrific 
last night.’ Fearnley-Whittingstall moved into the original River 
Cottage in Dorset in 1998. He went on to write a series of best-selling 
books based on his philosophy of ethically sourced food and moved his 
headquarters to Park Farm in 2006.

He also runs the River Cottage Canteen
 and Deli in the centre of Axminster and last year opened the latest 
addition to his empire – a second Canteen and Deli in Plymouth.
