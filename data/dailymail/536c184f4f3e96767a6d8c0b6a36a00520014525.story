A fan of The Simpsons who was banned from watching the popular TV cartoon as a child has broken a world record after getting covered in tattoos of Homer Simpson.

Lee Weir, 27, dubbed his father the 'real-life Ned Flanders' and was not allowed to watch the popular cartoon as head of the household Homer was depicted to be a 'buffoon'.

But father-of-one Mr Weir was so in love with the famous animated sitcom that he had his favourite characters etched on to his skin in ink for life.

Mr Weir, from Auckland, New Zealand, has had his favourite characters etched on to his skin in ink for life

His 41 tattoos earned him the prestigious title of world record holder for having the most tattoos of the same cartoon character tattooed on the body.

Mr Weir, from Auckland, New Zealand, said: 'I was never allowed to watch The Simpsons growing up as my dad was a real-life Ned Flanders.

'He wouldn't let me watch as it depicted the father and the head of the household to be a bafoon.

'But I've always enjoyed watching the show in later life and it feels incredible to be a record breaker.

Mr Weir had to provide dermatologist reports to Guinness World Records officials to prove they were real

'My two-year-old daughter Lucy can point out different Homer tattoos on my arm - her favourite is "baby Homer".

'To have a record for something that is not only cool but also very close to me is just brilliant.

'It hasn't made me a better person but I definitely think it has made me a slightly cooler one.'

The university student said the Homer sleeve took more than 25 hours to complete and that he had to provide dermatologist reports to Guinness World Records officials to prove they were real.

All of his record-breaking tattoos were done by close friend and tattooist Ben Jenkins and was announced as a world record holder on June 5.
