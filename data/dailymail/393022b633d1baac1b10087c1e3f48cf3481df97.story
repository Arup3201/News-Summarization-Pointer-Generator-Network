It was certainly an eventful night for Sophie Ellis-Bextor.

The 34-year-old singer, along with fellow Strictly Come Dancing contestants Abbey Clancy and Natalie Gumede, were all victims of a spate of dressing room thefts as they took part in the live show from the Blackpool Tower.

According to reports, items stolen included iPhones, iPads and cash, with the trio left 'very upset' by the incident.

Doing her best to raise spirits: Sophie Ellis-Bextor sang at a Strictly afterparty after she, Abbey Clancy and Natalie Gumede were targeted by dressing room thieves

It is believed the gang targeted the women's dressing room at The Blackpool Tower while Strictly Come Dancing was being filmed and then escaped through a network of underground tunnels

Police are investigating the theft in which iPads, iPhones, cash and jewellery were all stolen

A
Lancashire Police spokesperson said of the thefts: 'We are 
investigating a theft that has occurred this evening at the Tower 
ballroom at Blackpool.

'It 
was reported to us at around 9:45pm that some items had been taken from a
dressing room within the building - officers are investigating the 
theft and are making a number of enquiries to trace the person or people
responsible and we would appeal to anyone who may have seen any 
suspicious activity in the area to contact police.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

However, Sophie did her utmost to lift the spirits of the Strictly contingent as she belted out her famous single Murder
on the Dance Floor during an afterparty following the show at Roxy's nightclub.

The
singer, whose dance that evening was described as ‘spot-on’ by judge Len 
Goodman, arrived at the party with her The Feeling husband Richard Jones
in tow.

Meanwhile, 
Abbey was accompanied by footballer husband Peter Crouch, while Susanna 
Reid and Claudia Winkleman also made an appearance at the bash.

And
despite the dressing room thefts, it seems the group did have something
to celebrate as it’s been revealed that Saturday night's episode of the
show peaked in the ratings with 11.3million people tuning in.
