A reclusive Missouri man shot dead four relatives and three neighbors in a nighttime rampage after one of the other families in the town denied his request for a job, a resident said.

Joseph Aldridge, 36, allegedly opened fire in four separate locations on Thursday night  in Tyrone, Texas County.

The shooter may have unsuccessfully asked Darrell Shriver, 68, for a job before killing him, his son Carey Shriver, 46, and Carey's wife, Valirea, 44, according to the elder victim's cousin John, 72.

Nine people are dead in the tiny rural community - including Aldridge, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree that followed the death of his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill.

Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers

Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town

It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online.

The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969.

Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive.

'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said.

The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star.

The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister

He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'.

The motive for the gunman killing his cousin Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, is unknown

Authorities identified the four other victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48.

The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold.

John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the Associated Press. 

His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between the shooter and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online.    

The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot.

'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said.  

'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the Springfield News Leader.

The shooter had no trouble getting into his neighbor's homes.

Armed with a .45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot his seven victims before killing himself in his pickup truck in the middle of a highway on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County.

The car was still running. He did not leave a note. 

Around town, Aldridge was described as a recluse, and it was unclear what, if anything, he did for a living.

Vernetta Lucille Swartz, 76, Joseph Aldridge's aunt, now lives California and said was grief-stricken.

'Two of my nephews and wives were shot, and I guess another nephew was the shooter,' she said.

A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville is aware of each other, and that Aldridge 'probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'. 

Tyrone is estimated to have around 50 residents. 

All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. 

Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night.

The woman, who Aldridge lived with, had a history of breast and lung cancer.

Police discovered her while looking for her son. 

Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

Joseph Aldridge has a previous criminal history that includes being sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for possessing a handgun while being a marijuana user. He was released in 2010. 

Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday.

The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. 

Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects.

'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said

Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling Friday morning, according to the Houston Herald.

Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation.

Children related to victims were not in school on Friday. 

'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. 

Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood.

Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.'

Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling.   

Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none. 

The Aldridges will be buried on Thursday at First General Baptist Church in nearby Willow Springs.

An online fundraising page for their family had raised more than $8,000 as of Sunday morning.

Many residents of Texas County have expressed their condolences for the victims' families by changing their profile pictures to a man leaning over in prayer.
