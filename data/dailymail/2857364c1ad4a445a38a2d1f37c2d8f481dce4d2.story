With just 47 days until Scotland votes on independence, Alex Salmond has been unfurling the Saltire whenever he can.

So a cheeky England fan couldn't resist photobombing the First Minister with the St George's Cross - a year after Salmond pulled a similar stunt at Wimbledon.

The politician was watching the men's 10m synchronised diving final in Edinburgh at the Commonwealth Games, which saw England's Tom Daley and James Denny claim silver.

He smiled, gasped and held his hand to his mouth - all the while oblivious to the fan behind him, who gave the camera a knowing smile.

The incident yesterday came days after a woman was escorted from the swimming arena by police for waving a Scottish flag with the word 'Yes' printed on it.

Rules for spectators prevent banners with 'political messages' and police insisted the Saltire was allowed.

But the rules didn't stop Salmond - who is gearing up for the referendum on September 18 - infamously waving a Saltire behind David Cameron in the Wimbledon Royal Box when Scot Andy Murray claimed victory last year.
