The Hampshire district of Hart has been named as the most desirable place to live in the UK for a third year in a row, it has emerged.

Nestled in the north-east corner of the county, residents of Hart have the longest life expectancy in the country - 82.9 years for men, compared with the UK average, 79 - and are considered the UK's healthiest.

People earn an average £843 a week compared with the national average of £616, and the employment rate in the area is 80 per cent - nine percentage points higher than the national average.

This is the third year in a row that the district of Hart has been named the most desirable place to live

The region, which is centred around the town of Fleet, described as ‘a step back in time’, has 84 square-miles of green wooded landscape and Hampshire’s largest freshwater lake.

But Hart residents do pay for their quality of life – with the average house price costing seven times the annual local wage – much higher than the UK average multiple, 5.8 times.

Uttlesford in Essex, which came in second place, also has an average house price-to-earnings ratio of seven.

Placed at number six a year ago, the district performed particularly well with its 84 per cent employment rate and weekly average earnings of £819.

The Halifax quality of life survey, which looks at a wide range of factors such as health and life expectancy, crime rates, weather, employment and the performance of local schools.

The local government district of Hart, named after the river that runs through it, is an area renowned for its quality of life.

While its main town, Fleet, may be most famous for its service station, it has produced some great sporting names.

Golfer Justin Rose, tennis player John Feaver and motor racing driver Jeremy Metcalfe all have ties to the area.

In addition, a Sport England survey found Hart to be the fifth most active district in the country, with more than a quarter of people exercising three times a week.

As well as the high income associated with the area, this sporting prowess may go some way to explaining the average high life expectancy.

There are believed to be around 85,000 residents in the area, which has a Conservative-controlled council.

Fleet, which is 37 miles south-west of London, has also produced actresses Juliet Aubrey and Raquel Cassidy.

Nowhere in Wales or Northern Ireland made the top 50 list, but Scotland scraped in with the Orkney Islands placed at number 50.

Just one area of London was included, with the City of London in 38th position.

This year saw several big climbers into the top ten list of districts with the best quality of life, mainly because Halifax has started taking into account new Office for National Statistics (ONS) research into personal wellbeing.

South Northamptonshire soared up 27 places to the third spot, Rushcliffe in Nottingham shot up from number 22 last year to seven and Winchester, which was placed at number 34 in 2012, is now in ninth place.

The new ONS research also helped to push Uttlesford into second place. It revealed that adults in Uttlesford believe, more than anywhere else in the UK, that what they do in life is worthwhile, scoring 8.4 out of 10 on this measure.

Continuing a trend, the South East dominated the top 50 list, claiming almost half of it, with a total of 24 mentions. Meanwhile, the East of England claimed 12 of the places.

Southern areas tend to score more highly for weekly earnings, weather, health and life expectancy while the North fares well on education and lower house prices in relation to earnings.

Uttlesford came second in the list, with an 84 per cent employment rate and weekly average earnings of £819

Researchers found that employment is highest in Northamptonshire, at 88.9 per cent. The highest weekly average earnings are in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea at £1,323.

Meanwhile, the biggest homes are in Uttlesford, Chiltern, South Buckinghamshire and Rutland, which all have an average of 6.4 habitable rooms. The smallest homes are all in central London - in the City of London, Tower Hamlets and Westminster. All these London areas have less than four habitable rooms on average.

A total of 100 per cent of homes in East Ayrshire, Scotland, were found to have central heating, compared with the average of 96 per cent. The Orkney Islands has the lowest burglary rate at one per 10,000 people.

Just one area of London was included, with the City of London in 38th position in the top-50 list

Castle Point in Essex has the lowest average annual rainfall at 20in (508mm), while the Isle of Wight was named as the sunniest place in the UK. Isle of Wight residents enjoy 37.4 hours of sunshine a week, compared with the national average of 29.7 hours.

Martin Ellis, an economist at Halifax, said: 'The old adage of "health, wealth and happiness" is the traditional measure of a good quality of life.

'For the third year running Hart has delivered against a range of indicators to demonstrate its residents have the best quality of life in the UK.'
