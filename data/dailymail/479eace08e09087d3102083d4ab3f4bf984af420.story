Accused: Drew Peterson, 58, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

A forensic pathologist who performed a second autopsy on Drew Peterson's third wife years after she was found dead in her dry bathtub testified Thursday that there's just one plausible explanation for her death: She was murdered.

But under aggressive questioning by the defense, Dr. Larry Blum conceded that some of his well-respected counterparts disagreed and still maintained her death was an accident.

A coroner initially ruled Kathleen Savio died in an accidental fall in her bathtub. Her 2004 death was reclassified a homicide only after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, vanished in 2007 and Blum did his new examination.

Testifying for a second day Thursday, Blum told jurors he didn't believe a single, fatal slip could explain how Savio had a fresh gash on the back of her head and a pattern of deep bruises on the front of her body.

‘I couldn't see how that could happen,’ Blum testified.

Blum, a key witness for the state, was subject to aggressive questioning by the defense later in the day. Over the objections of prosecutors, the judge let defense attorney Ralph Meczyk ask if three other pathologists who reviewed autopsy data still held Savio died accidentally.

‘Despite their opinion, you say homicide?’ the attorney asked.‘I haven't changed my opinion,’ Blum responded.

Blum also denied Meczyk's suggestion that he manipulated his autopsy results to mesh with Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow's theory that Savio was murdered.

Blum testified earlier that Savio's circular tub also had no edges pronounced enough to cause the two-inch, straight-line wound on her head.

Also, the position of Savio's body in the tub - face down and with her feet jammed against the sides of the tub - did not support a theory that she slipped and hit the back of her head, he said.

Peterson, a 58-year-old former suburban Chicago police officer, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in Savio's death. He is also a suspect in Stacy Peterson's disappearance, although he has never been charged in her case. Authorities presume she is dead, though a body has never been found.

It was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the 
bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a 
homicide

Peterson's attorneys maintain the 
original, 2004 autopsy on Savio's body by Dr. Bryan Mitchell was sound 
and that his finding of an accidental death holds up. Mitchell died in 
2010.

Under cross examination by Meczyk, 
Blum conceded that the coroner who deemed Savio's death accidental had 
been respected in the field.

‘He did an orthodox and professional autopsy?’ the attorney asked.

'Yes, sir,’ Blum responded.

Earlier in the day, Blum testified 
that it was ‘extremely rare’ for an otherwise healthy person to 
accidentally drown in a bathtub, unless alcohol or drugs were factors, 
which, he said, were not in Savio's case.

He also described how Savio's body 
was partly mummified and skeletonized by the time he examined it in 
2007. He said decomposition was accelerated because water had gotten 
into her coffin. But, he said, autopsy work could still be performed.

Blum said he cut into parts of 
Savio's body, including on her hip, to discover that some bruises went 
almost to the bone, suggesting a major force caused the injuries. Blum 
also looked at photographs from the original autopsy and crime scene to 
make his determination.

At one point, defense attorney Mecyk 
asked Blum if the bruise on Savio's lower left side could have been 
caused by banging into a door a suggestion that plunged the courtroom 
into a pandemonium as the defense and prosecution started yelling 
objections over one another, the station WGNTV reported.

Meczyk also repeatedly challenged 
Blum about how he could be sure Savio's bruises were freshly made before
she died, suggesting a struggle or beating preceded her death. The 
defense attorney suggested there were other indications the bruises were
at least days old.

Blum also conceded that no skin or 
blood was found under Savio's fingernails, which could have been an 
indication that she had been involved in a desperate fight for her life.

‘You would expect that during a struggle, there would be ... DNA or tissue underneath the fingernails?’ Meczyk asked.

‘If the victim scratched the assailant, there may be. Correct,’ Blum responded.

During Thursday’s testimony, the 
prosecutors suffered a potential blow to its case when the judge barred 
them from implying that Peterson tried to stage the death scene by 
placing a blue bath towel on the edge of the dry tub shortly after 
Savio’s body was discovered, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The neighbors who found the woman 
dead in the bathroom testified that it was odd there were no towels 
around, but a blue towel was later photographed on the tub.

Judge Edward Burmila barred 
prosecutors from implying that Peterson must have left the towel because
every other witness denied placing it there.

On Tuesday, Judge Burmila lambasted 
prosecutors who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject 
they were told not to mention in front of jurors -- again raising the 
possibility that the case could end with the judge letting the former 
police officer go free.

Blunders: The judge at Drew Peterson's murder trial on Tuesday lambasted prosecutors, namely Kathleen Patton seen here, who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors

Burmila seemed unmoved by repeated 
apologies by an attorney for the state and said he would rule Wednesday 
on whether to declare a mistrial in a case beset by problems from its 
outset.

Just two hours before, Burmila had 
told prosecutor Kathleen Patton not to ask a witness about whether Savio
had sought an order of protection against Peterson in front of the 
jury.

When she did, he told jurors to leave the room and berated the prosecutor.'There was one thing I told you not to go into and that's exactly what you did,' Burmila told her.

The
error came just as the trial seemed to be going prosecutors' way in 
recent days, with the judge granting them permission to present hearsay 
evidence central to their case.

Hearsay,
or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness, is not 
usually admissible in court, but Illinois passed a law – known as 
'Drew’s Law' - in the wake of the Peterson case that allows it in 
certain circumstances.

Prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking 
Peterson to Savio's death, so hearsay evidence about what Savio 
allegedly said to other people is crucial to their case.

The mistake also came as Patton was questioning one of the state's most compelling witnesses so far.

Former
police officer Teresa Kernc had just told jurors about interviewing 
Savio in 2002 after Peterson allegedly broke into Savio's home in a SWAT
uniform and repeatedly pushed her to the ground.

At one point, Savio allegedly told Peterson, 'Go ahead and do what you came to do: Kill me,' Kernc testified.

'He said, "Where do you want it?"And she said, "In the head.'' ' Kernc testified.

Peterson then allegedly told Savio to turn her head, which Savio did, Kernc said, based on what Savio told her.

'And then he said, "I can't kill you,'' she told jurors. Peterson then threw a garage opener to the ground and left.

Shortly after Kernc finished telling 
that story, Patton turned and asked, 'Did she tell you she wanted to get
an order of protection?'

The defense objected to Patton's question, and the judge asked jurors to leave the room.

Defense
attorneys asked not only for a mistrial but for a 'mistrial with 
prejudice,' meaning Peterson could be set free and never be charged 
again with Savio's murder. Declaring a mistrial with prejudice is a rare
judicial step. Burmila could also declare a more standard mistrial, 
meaning Peterson would be retried later.

The judge could also instruct the 
jury to disregard what the prosecutor said. If he takes that route, it 
could still signal to jurors that prosecutors have -- again -- messed 
up, potentially influencing their decision during deliberations.

Defense attorney Joel Brodsky cited 
other times prosecutors broached prohibited subjects, including when 
Glasgow -- just 10 minutes into his opening statement -- referred to an 
accusation that Peterson once tried to hire a hit man.

'It
is an avalanche of prejudicial, illegal evidence that is polluting this
jury,' he said. 'To have this many ... errors, how can the defendant 
get a fair trial?'
