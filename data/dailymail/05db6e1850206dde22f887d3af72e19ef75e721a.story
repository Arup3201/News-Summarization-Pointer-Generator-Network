For Gill Rowe, her father’s war medals weren’t just a poignant reminder of his sacrifice 100 years on – they were a treasured link to her long-lost past.

But just hours before Remembrance Sunday, heartless thieves broke into the 82-year-old’s home and stole her late father’s three medals.

The widowed former nurse was taking a group of elderly ladies to a lunch when the burglar struck. 

Gill Rowe (pictured holding a photograph of her and her late father on her wedding day) says she has been unable to sleep since her father's war medals were stolen from her home on Saturday afternoon

Mrs Rowe, a devoted Christian who is a reader at her local church in Hayes, south-east London, planned to wear the medals to lead prayers at the Remembrance Sunday service as she has for the past 16 years.

But when she returned home late on Saturday afternoon she was distraught to find her door had been forced by thieves who rifled through her two-bedroom property in Bromley, before taking the prized medals from her bedside dressing table. 

Yesterday, she appealed for the cruel thief to hand back the treasured heirlooms.

Her father, Private Harry Syms, was awarded two medals for his time serving with the Army in France in the First World War, where he received devastating injuries at the age of 17 that left him with a limp for the rest of his life. 

Due to his injuries, he was unable to serve in the Second World War, but was in the civil service and received a third medal with a citation signed by royalty for his vital security work for his country.

Yesterday, Mrs Rowe said the medals were all she had left of her father, who died in 1959 aged 60.

‘I feel like they have stolen a piece of him,’ she said. ‘They are part of the family. I can never replace them.

‘I have worn his medals for years every Remembrance Sunday at church. I have always worn them with pride for what my father did.

‘My mother gave them to me when she died at the age of 100.

‘I loved my father dearly and they meant so much to me.

‘My father joined up when he was 16 in 1914. He was wounded badly and was later discharged from the Army. He worked for the government doing security work, which he never talked about. But he received a medal because he did a lot of important work.’

Mrs Rowe returned home at 5pm on Saturday afternoon to find her front door wouldn’t open as the lock had been damaged. 

She said: ‘At first I didn’t realise what had happened.

‘Then I went upstairs to get the medals out ready for the service the next day and I discovered they had gone.

‘My heart sunk. I was absolutely devastated. I can’t forget that someone has been walking around my home looking at things, opening my drawers and taking the medals.

‘It’s frightened me. I feel like it’s not my home any more. I felt violated and I couldn’t sleep.’

A piggy bank containing around £20 in coins was also taken during the burglary.

At least one of the medals from the First World War, which were on ribbons, had HA SYMS engraved around the edge.

Despite her distress, Mrs Rowe attended the Remembrance service at St Mary’s Church in Hayes on Sunday.

‘I was very upset but I wanted to go to the service,’ she said. 

‘I can only hope someone will recognise how important these medals are and hand them back.’ 

Anyone with information, or who has been offered the medals to buy, is asked to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
