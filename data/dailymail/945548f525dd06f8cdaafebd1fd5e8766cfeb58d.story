Muslim footballer Franck Ribery raced around the pitch but could not escape from his Bayern Munich team mates who were set on chucking beer over him as they celebrated their title win.

The Frenchman had reportedly told players to keep the alcohol  - which is forbidden by his religion - away from him as they partied on the pitch
after their 3-0 win over Augsburg.

But despite running away, Ribery was eventually collared by team-mate Jerome Boateng, who poured a large glass of beer over his head.

Although he looked as if he had taken it well at the time, fans suggested he would not have been impressed with Boateng.

Pictures of Ribery getting covered in beer, accompanied by the caption 'I won't talk to Boateng again, he knows that I'm Muslim. I'm p***** off,' spread on social media after the game.

Last night neither Ribery or his agent could be contacted to confirm how he had taken the stunt.

It is not the first controversy involving Ribery - the 30-year-old is due in court in June after sleeping with an underage Moroccan prostitute, although he claims he did not know she was 17.

Ribery is not averse to pranks - in 2010 he was caught on camera pouring water on former Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn from a rooftop.

The footballer converted to Islam to marry Wahiba, his childhood sweetheart - the couple have two daughters.

But he was forced to admit he had an affair a few years ago with call girl Zahia Dehar. 

Ribery, confessed to having sex with Zahia Dehar but denies he knew she was underage.

He has been charged after flying the girl, who was 17, to a hotel room in Germany.

Dehar
told France's Paris Match magazine how he paid £5,000 for a room in a 
five-star hotel and her flights to Munich for his birthday on April 7, 
2010.

She said: 'I was Ribery’s brithday present.

'Franck approached me in a Paris club. He booked me and flew me to Munich to celebrate his 26th birthday.

'He made reservations at a luxury hotel in Munich. We had sex and he paid me. I was a lovely little present, wasn’t I?'

Although the legal age of consent is 15 in France, 18 is the minimum age to work as a prostitute.

Dehar told France coach Raymond Domenech not to exclude Ribery from his 2010 World Cup squad when the scandal broke.

'How
could I have imagined, when I hid my age so as not to put my partners 
off, that their good faith could one day be held against them,' she 
said.

Affair: It is not the first controversy involving Ribery - the 30-year-old is due in court in June after sleeping with  underage Moroccan prostitute Zahia Dehar although he claims he did not know she was 17

Last year Franck Ribery and former Chelsea winger Arjen Robben had to be dragged apart by shocked team-mates after a furious dressing room bust-up midway through Bayern Munich’s Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid.

A row that started on the pitch shortly before half-time escalated after the players reached the dressing room, as the pair traded insults and angrily squared up to each other.

According to sources in Munich, Ribery aimed a punch at Robben and caught him under the eye, before team-mates stepped in and pulled them apart.

It is understood both players were hauled before Bayern bosses the following morning and given a dressing down, with Ribery taking most of the blame and being fined for his actions.
