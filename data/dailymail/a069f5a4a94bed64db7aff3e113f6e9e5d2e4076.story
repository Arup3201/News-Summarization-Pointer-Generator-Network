Neil Lennon called him his 'street kid' and the word on the streets of Bolton is that pocket-sized Zach Clough will soon be a big name in football.

Clough looks slight but is built like a light-welterweight boxer and can pack a punch. He delivered a knockout blow to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup third round and his quick one-two against Wolverhampton Wanderers almost took the points in a 2-2 draw last weekend.

So good were his performances, his excited nan Mavis called up local radio to extol his talent. Certainly his Bolton Wanderers team-mates recognise the 19-year-old's ability to spring a surprise on Liverpool on Wednesday night.

'He won’t freeze,' said gnarled 6ft 5ins defender David Wheater. 'He always wants the ball, even in training where I kick him quite a lot.

'Sometimes you can kick the younger lads and they go away but he wants the ball all the time. He’ll be good against Liverpool. He won’t be thinking about what stage he is playing on. He just wants to play football, every game is the same for him. It wouldn’t surprise me if he does score or if he gets man of the match - he’s that good.'

Softly spoken, Clough says it like it is. He attended Audenshaw School, which boasts singer Mick Hucknall as a former pupil, he was a promising cricketer as a boy and wears black boots. There's certainly a lot to like about the teenager from Denton.

Clough has scored three times in two games for Bolton and is seen as a real prospect

'He's not a ragamuffin,' said manager Lennon. 'He's polite and he's well mannered but he's a hungry boy and he just loves playing his football.'

A Manchester City fan, 5ft 7ins Clough still tries to sneak across to Eastlands with his father Paul to ogle the skills of David Silva and Samir Nasri, who play in his favoured position 'at the top of a diamond or in the hole'.

Born on March 8, 1995, the same day that Bolton team-mate Emile Heskey made his debut for Leicester City, Clough has already joined an illustrious band; he scored on his Bolton debut, as have Heskey, Daniel Sturridge, Andy Walker and a certain Nat Lofthouse.

The omens are good and Clough is happy to aim high.

'Three goals in two games has been a great start but hopefully it will be 10 goals in 10 games,' he said. 'I’ve been popping in goals for a long time. I’ve been here since I was eight years old, and worked under some great coaches.

'Being involved against Liverpool in a game live on Match of the Day would be a dream come true. What a game it’s going to be - I’ve worked hard to get that sort of moment. The whole nation will be watching.'
