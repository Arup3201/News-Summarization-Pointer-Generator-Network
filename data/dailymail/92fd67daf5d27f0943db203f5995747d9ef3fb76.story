Stephen King might never have made it as a best-selling author and Carrie would never have existed if it hadn’t been for his wife, Tabby.

The new Hollywood movie, Carrie, which is the third silver-screened adaption of King’s horror story, was released on Friday, October 18, starring Julianne Moore and Chloë Grace Moretz.

But 40 years ago, when King wrote the first three pages of Carrie in 1973, he immediately crumpled them up and threw them in the dustbin.

Believed in him: Stephen King, right, says his wife Tabby, left, saved Carrie from the dustbin. Carrie launched his career as a best-selling author

Discarded: The horror story, Carrie, by Stephen King, almost did not make it past three pages

He was disappointed in himself and felt he couldn’t write from a woman’s perspective, according to Mental Floss.

The whole story disgusted him, too. Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim and he felt the plot was already moving too slowly.

‘I couldn’t see wasting two weeks, maybe even a month, creating a novella I didn’t like and wouldn’t be able to sell,’ King wrote in his memoir, On Writing.

‘So I threw it away … After all, who wanted to read a book about a poor girl with menstrual problems?’

The next day, his wife Tabby found the 
three crinkled balls of paper and when King came home from work, she 
told him, ‘You’ve got something here. I really think you do'. 

First attempt: In the early 70s King felt Carrie White, the main character, was an annoying, ready-made victim when he first wrote the book

Over the next few weeks, Tabby guided
 her husband through the world of women, giving tips on how to mold the 
characters and the famous shower scene.

Nine months later the final draft was finished.

This
 was at a time when King was a poor man. He and Tabby lived in a trailer
 and drove a rusty Buick held together by baling wire and duct tape.

Tabby
 worked second-shift at Dunkin’ Donuts while King taught English at 
Hampden Academy, a private high school in eastern Maine.

To scrape by, King worked summers at an industrial laundry and moonlighted as a janitor and gas pump attendant.

He modelled the character of Carrie on two of the loneliest girls he remembered from high school.

One was a timid epileptic with a voice that always gurgled with phlegm. Her fundamentalist mother kept a life-size crucifix in the living room, and it was clear to King that the thought of it followed her down the halls.

The second girl was a loner who wore the same outfit every day, which drew cruel taunts.

By the time King wrote Carrie, both of those girls were dead.

The first died alone after a seizure. The second suffered from postpartum depression and, one day, aimed a rifle at her stomach and pulled the trigger.

The final draft was turned down for 30 publishers, but one, the editor at Doubleday Publishing, Bill Thompson, offered him a $2,500 advance to publish the book.

Instant: Stephen King was catapulted to fame with the book Carrie in 1973 and has written many books since

King used the advance to buy a shiny Ford Pinto and moved his family out of the trailer and into a dumpy four-room apartment in Bangor, Maine.

They suddenly had money for groceries and could even afford a telephone.

He hoped that fat royalty checks would keep replenishing his bank account, but Carrie only sold 13,000 copies as a hardback, which convinced him to grudgingly sign a new teaching contract for the 1974 school year. 

But soon after, one phone call changed everything. It was Bill Thompson again. ‘Are you sitting down?’ he asked.

King was home alone, standing in the doorway between his kitchen and living room. ‘Do I need to? he said.

‘You might,’ Thompson said. ‘The paperback rights to Carrie went to Signet Books for $400,000 ... 200K of it is yours. Congratulations, Stephen.’

Break-through: The paperback rights to Carrie were given to Signet Books for $400,000 in 1973 at a time when King was a poor teacher with almost no money

Successful: King is now the 19th best-selling author of all time

Carrie sold over 1 million copies in its first year as a paperback despite a mixed critical response.

The New York Times was impressed, considering it was a first novel, while Library Journal called it ‘terribly overdone.’

Falling somewhere in the middle, the critic at the Wilson Library Journal said, ‘It’s pure trash, but I loved it.’

The book-buying public was more enthusiastic - Carrie was a hit.

The novel struck a sympathetic chord with teens and adults who knew what it was like to be an outsider.

In 1975, it was adapted into a profitable feature film, which sparked a sequel a decade later.

Now the 19th best-selling author of all time, King won the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2003 and was invited to speak at the National Book Awards.

When he spoke, he didn’t talk about writing or success or money. He talked about the woman who rescued Carrie from the trash and insisted he keep going - Tabby.

‘If my wife had suggested to me even with love and kindness and gentleness ... that the time had come to put my dreams away and support my family, I would have done that with no complaint,’ said King at the awards ceremony.

But the thought never crossed her mind. And if you open any edition of Carrie, you’ll read the same dedication: ‘This is for Tabby, who got me into it—and then bailed me out of it.’
