I had Novak Djokovic as strong favourite for the Australian Open title but now I am not so sure. I am feeling increasingly good vibes about Andy Murray.

Novak’s semi-final win was one of the strangest five-set matches I have seen in a long time. He seemed to be struggling with himself, with his breathing, and in technical terms with his backhand.

That is the world No 1’s bread-and-butter shot, and it misfired so much he was lucky Stan Wawrinka did not take full advantage.

With the way Murray has been playing, he won’t be so charitable. So, while a different Djokovic might show up for the final, I like the Brit’s chances. Andy must stick with the aggressive game that has served him so well in getting this far, and the key for him is to stick with that big forehand and do what he did against Tomas Berdych. In the past he has shown a tendency to beat lesser opponents using his more defensive game and then tried to flick the switch towards a more attacking style when faced with the best.

What has been encouraging here is that you could tell from the first round he was going to be aggressive. It is so much easier to keep that up and execute under pressure when you have been doing it from the start.

Murray will look to flick on an attacking style of play when he plays against Djokovic

Murray has done a good job of putting pressure on his opponents’ first serve in this tournament.

He is winning 36.6 per cent of first-serve return points, compared to 34 per cent in Melbourne last year.

I have noticed quite a few changes. Murray’s first serve has been excellent and that has allowed him to play a lot more one-two combinations in the manner you associate with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer: get a fast and accurate first serve in and then follow it up with a big first strike.

He has also shifted his court position slightly due to the confidence with which he is hitting his forehand. Often before, when the ball was in the middle of the court, he favoured his backhand side, but he’s been running around it more to hit the forehand — a sure sign of a feelgood factor.

It has also been noticeable how many returns he has got back in play from first serves. Berdych had been serving outstandingly but he could not make that count enough in the semi.

Of course, we know Andy is a great returner and a great mover, and in those departments he is back to what we saw in 2012 and up to Wimbledon 2013. All of the above must be replicated against Djokovic, as well as the way he has kept his frustrations to short flashes and recovered his composure when under pressure.

He has got into a rhythm of playing his matches in the evenings since last Sunday’s fourth round on Rod Laver Arena. And it will not hurt that Novak had a long match, and didn’t finish media commitments until well past midnight. Right now, I’m thinking the final is what we call a ‘pick ’em’. In other words, a 50-50.
