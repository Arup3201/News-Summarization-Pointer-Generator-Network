Cristiano Ronaldo is the ultimate professional but Lionel Messi is more naturally gifted, according to former team-mate of both superstars Deco.

The now-retired 37-year-old played with Messi during their time together at Barcelona, while he has also shared the pitch with Ronaldo as part of Portugal's national side. 

While Deco respects both players who have shared the last seven Ballon d'Ors between then, he concedes that Messi hold the edge in terms of pure 'talent' - although he suggested that another former Barca team-mate Ronaldinho could be better than both.

Jose Mourinho is the best manager in the world according to his former Porto playmaker

'[Leo and Cristiano] are different,' he told FourFourTwo. 'Messi was born with talent. Cristiano also has talent but it's amazing how hard he works at it; how professional he is.

'It's difficult to pick one but maybe Leo is the best I've ever played with. Although, Ronaldinho did things that I've never seen anyone do.'

During the Q&A session, Deco also singled out former Porto manager Jose Mourinho as the best manager he has ever worked with after changing the mentality of Portuguese football. 

'I think he's the best, though I've had many great coaches: Fernando Santos, Carlo Ancelotti, Felipe Scolari,' Deco said.

'However, Mourinho brought something different. He brought ambition because in those days in Portugal it was difficult to imagine that one of our clubs could win the Champions League.'
