A new scathing report has unearthed shocking statistics about student maths teachers. 

It claims typical student teachers have the maths ability of a 12-year-old and they wouldn't have the necessary skills to pass a Year 9 NAPLAN test. 

Dr Stephen Norton, a lecturer in mathematics at Griffith University in Queensland, conducted the research, which shows that nearly half of his class would not pass the year 9 test, even after three or four years of study. 

A new scathing report has unearthed shocking statistics about student maths teachers

He tested the maths ability of all of his 125 students, including 40 students in the third year of their bachelor of education degree. 

The 125 students had enrolled in a graduate diploma of education at Griffith University, which only accepts students who have already completed a bachelor degree. 

Of the 165 students tested, just about half of them could convert 5.48km into metres.

More than half of the student teachers who took the test could not answer the simple question: 'If the total cost of three tickets is $5.64, how much will 10 tickets cost?'.

17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Interestingly, one in four easily converted fractions to percentages while just one in five were able to find the highest common factor of the numbers 28 and 70.

In another worrying find, one in three students were capable of finding the areas of rectangles and triangles.  

Speaking to The Weekend Australian, Dr Norton vented his frustration over the results, claiming his students should have mastered the ability to answer all these questions by the end of primary school. 

'Every year I test my students and they've got th understanding of a Year 7 or Yaer 8 kid,'

17% of the students ran in to trouble converting 6kg into grams and only 16% were able to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

'They struggle with fractions and proportional reasoning and anything to do with algebra,'

'They should have mastered this by the end of primary school,' he said. 

The alarming results have reignited calls for a  investigation into how mathematics is taught at school and university.
