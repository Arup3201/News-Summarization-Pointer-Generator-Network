Mario Balotelli will be hauled over the coals by Brendan Rodgers after he ridiculously swapped shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half-time.

On a night when Liverpool's Champions League ambitions were left hanging by a thread after a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo and two from Karim Benzema condemned them to a 3-0 defeat at Anfield, Balotelli came in for huge criticism, especially from the Liverpool Echo.

The local publication insisted that Balotelli must apologise to the club to continue his career with the Reds. The striker was taken off after another ineffectual performance and Rodgers, who described the switch as 'tactical', revealed he would be speaking to the Italian, as swapping shirts early is not something of which the manager approves.

Last season Rodgers took measures against Mamadou Sakho after he traded jerseys with Samuel Eto'o during a defeat by Chelsea and Balotelli will be summoned to see Rodgers in his office at Liverpool's Melwood training ground.

'I had a similar incident last year and it was dealt with internally,' said Rodgers. 'It's exactly the same. I heard about it when I came off pitch. If you want to do that, it's something you do at end of the game and something I will deal with.

'I needed more movement centrally to occupy their centre halves and I felt Raheem Sterling's speed would give us that. In the second half you could see every player pressing and working – for us that's the minimum. Lallana came on and did it very well. Raheem played in position a bit alien to him.'

Others were more damning of Balotelli. Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher said on Sky: 'I can't change the way I feel about Balotelli and that is nothing to do with what he's done in a Liverpool shirt. It's what he's done at Manchester City and AC Milan.

'Do I think he's going to be here long-term? No, I'd be surprised to see him here next season if I'm being honest. Rafa Benitez was here a few years, bought Robbie Keane and sold him in January. It might not be that quick but I'd be surprised if Mario Balotelli is at the club next season.'

Former Liverpool skipper Phil Thompson added: 'I think it's disgraceful. I think it's disrespectful to both players. If you're swapping them, what's the other guy thinking about? You're giving away your shirt at half time, what is in his mind?'

'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club.

'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 

'The Liverpool fans are very knowledgeable, and you just don't do that (swap shirts at half time).

'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.'

Balotelli's indiscretion, however, should not disguise the fact Liverpool were comfortably beaten by a Real Madrid side that moved ominously through the gears, took advantage of some wretched defending and then easily held them at bay in the second period once the game was won.

Rodgers said: 'We started very well, aggressive in pressing and passing and coped very well. Then that period after the first goal to half-time – it was a disappointing first goal and the other two were sloppy. Obviously then 3-0 against a team that's so dangerous is very disappointing.'

Madrid are aiming to become the first team in the modern era to retain the Champions League and Ronaldo, who scored the opening goal, said: 'We are thinking step by step and we are going to try to retain it.

'We know it will be very tough, but we are positive and I think it will be possible if we play like that.'
