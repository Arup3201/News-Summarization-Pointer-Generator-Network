A mother has told how bungling housing bosses sent a letter to her two-year-old son threatening him with action for 'laughing too loudly at Thomas The Tank Engine'.

Jodie Holden, 22, was stunned when she opened a complaint letter addressed to her son Chenlair Bent accusing him of anti-social behaviour and branding him a 'noise nuisance'.

Housing officials also warned the child - who can't read or write - to be 'mindful' of his neighbours in Walsall, West Midlands.

But full-time mother Miss Holden claimed the only time her son makes any sort of noise is when he is laughing at his favourite TV programmes.

Walsall Housing Group have since apologised to Miss Holden for the embarrassing error.

The angry mother said: 'It is completely shocking. He is so young he can not open an envelope let alone read the letter.

'He is just a typical two-year-old boy he is hardly running around estates causing mayhem.

'The only time he ever makes any noise is when he is laughing in the back garden or watching Thomas the Tank Engine on TV.

'I find it hard to believe that he is causing that much of a noise nuisance. It is outrageous - he doesn't know what is going on.

Miss Holden, 22, was stunned when she opened a complaint letter addressed to her son

'I have spoken to my neighbours who have kids of their own and they don't have any problems with us. The letter also tells Chenlair to keep his family quiet. He is two. He doesn't have his own family.'

The letter, dated May 1 was addressed to Mr Chenlair Blair and headed: 'Anti-Social Behaviour - Breach of tenancy conditions'.

It read: 'Walsall Housing Group has received a complaint relating to noise nuisance and your property has been identified as the source of the noise.

'In this instance I do not intend to take any further action other than request you and your family are mindful of others living by who wish to enjoy to peace and quiet in their own home.'

The housing association admitted it had made an administrative error.

Ian Hill, Walsall Housing Group's head of communications and business improvement, said: 'We have already apologised to the customer for the error and wish to say sorry again for any upset caused.

'We will now continue our investigation into the anti-social behaviour allegations and have written to the correct member of the household.'
