Freedom: Phillip Machemedze walked free from court today after a judge ruled his sickening past was in 'another land'

A violent former henchman of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe has escaped jail despite fraudulently earning thousands of pounds working illegally in Britain as a carer.

Phillip Machemedze walked free from court today after a judge ruled his sickening past was in 'another land'.

The former enforcer, 47, lied about his immigration status to work in the drug and alcohol recovery unit at The Priory for five years without a visa.

He was also employed for seven years as a support worker for the Milestones Trust, a charity helping people with learning disabilities.

He fraudulently earned £151,000 while working illegally in Britain.

Former African enforcer Machemedze only successfully applied for asylum to the UK two years ago - allowing him and his wife to permanently stay in the country.

An immigration hearing heard how he broke one victim's jaw with a pair of pliers and shocked another with electric cables while working as one of Mugabe's henchmen.

But Machemedze - who claims benefits funded by the UK taxpayer - walked free from court today after admitting two charges of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception.

Judge Julian Lambert, sitting at Bristol Crown Court, gave Machemedze his liberty after receiving a notebook logging work he completed to 'benefit' his local community in the city.

The judge said: 'You are 47 years old and you have no previous convictions recorded against you in this country.

'Your past is in another land and that which took place in your past took place beyond our jurisdiction.

'When prohibited from working by your immigration status you got two jobs.

'The case is notable because you worked rather than sought state benefits.

'You worked hard and there are no complaints about the quality of your work.

'You are a Zimbabwean national and it has been determined by others that you may stay in this country and not return there.

'But your lies here should not have been told.'

Judge Lambert sentenced Machemedze to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years.

He ordered him to be electronically tagged and observe a curfew between 9pm and 6am for six months.

Machemedze, who has just acquired a new job working for 42 hours a week, will pay a fine of £1,000 in £10 weekly instalments.

Last October the judge told Machemedze he would walk free from court if he volunteered at his local Pentecostal church for just half a day a week for six months.

Machemedze, who lives in Redfield, Bristol, with wife Febbie, was a bodyguard to a senior minister as part of Mugabe's feared Central Intelligence Organisation.

Richard Posner, prosecuting the case, previously told the court how Machemedze had arrived at London Gatwick from Zimbabwe in July 2000 and was given a six-month visa but prohibited from working.

But he stayed in Britain - working illegally as a carer at an adolescent unit with The Priory in Bristol from June 2005 to May 2010.

Hearing: Bristol Crown Court heard Machemedze had illegally secured jobs by getting through several checks, including an enhanced criminal record bureau check

He also worked as a support worker for the Milestones Trust from May 2003 to May 2010.

Bristol Crown Court heard Machemedze had illegally secured jobs by getting through several checks, including an enhanced criminal record bureau check.

To obtain employment the Zimbabwean had also been able to provide the Home Office letter, a National insurance number as well as birth and marriage certificates.

In April 2005, the Milestones Trust were tipped off that Machemedze was working illegally - but he provided a letter from the Home Office stating otherwise.

During the seven-years of work, Machemedze took home a net income of around £151,000 before eventually applying for asylum.

An immigration judge decided Machemedze could face torture if he was returned home in May 2010.

He ruled that the African and his wife - who was also granted asylum - could stay in Britain indefinitely and earn a living.

Jane Chamberlain, mitigating, confirmed her client could pay £10 each week towards his £1,000 fine, starting from May 1.

She said: 'Up until this point he has been receiving benefits.'

Machemedze, dressed in a black open necked shirt and black trousers, did not comment as he left the court.
