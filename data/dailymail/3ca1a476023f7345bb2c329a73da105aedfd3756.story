A 21-year-old college student has tragically died after falling off a tree and landing on a metal post, killing him instantly according to police.

Jonathon Bennett, a junior at East Carolina University in North Carolina, was walking across a fallen tree with four friends early Wednesday morning when a branch he was holding broke causing him to slip, according to police.

Bennett fell six to eight feet before landing on a waist-high metal fence post, impaling him from the lower left of his back through his upper right chest.

Authorities say they believe he died instantly.

Bennett's roommate, Richard Horton, was the first to call police as his friends tried to perform CPR on him. That frantic 911 call around 1am was later released to WCTI12.

Dispatcher: 'OK, is he awake?'

Horton: 'No he is not awake. He has no pulse.'

Dispatcher: 'He has no pulse? Is he breathing?'

Horton: 'No [inaudible]. Is he breathing? Is he breathing? No, he's not breathing. He's not breathing. I'm sorry ma'am. I am just freaking out right now.'

'It was crazy because he said 
something to me before he grabbed the branch and the branch snapped. So 
it's kind of like, I don't really know how to feel,' Horton later told WNCT.

'It's tragic. It's an eye-opener, it really is, being that was the first time I'd seen something like that,' he said.

Well remembered: Bennett was an Eagle Scout, member of Tau Kappa Epsilon, the East Carolina Ambassadors - a service-based organization - and ECU Intramural Sports according to friends as well as his LinkedIn profile

Police
say alcohol may have played a factor with the young men having been 
drinking around the tree behind University Manor Apartments, the complex
police records say Bennett lived.

An autopsy is planned, potentially revealing his blood-alcohol levels at the time.

His family has since visited the wooded area
where he died. The metal post was one of several used to hold back 
debris and is said to have been put in place before the apartments were constructed.

Emergency responders had to cut the post from the ground to remove it and his body, according to WCTI.

Bennett was studying Geographic Information Science and Technology.

He was an Eagle Scout, member of Tau 
Kappa Epsilon, the East Carolina Ambassadors - a service-based 
organization - and ECU Intramural Sports, according to friends as well 
as his LinkedIn profile.

He also had a girlfriend.

'We were suppose to grow old together 
and end up living at the beach. I wish that this didnt happen. I know 
that you are in a better place but this just sucks. I love you to the 
moon and back ‚ù§,' she wrote.

In 
a candle-light ceremony remembering Bennett on Thursday, more than 100 
students gathered to remember the young man they lost 
tragically too soon.

Chairs were set up for his family members as well.

'I can, without a doubt in my mind, tell all of you now, and including you looking down on us Jonathon, that you were so very loved, respected, and cherished by all of us here tonight,' Brandon Pittman said in tears before the crowd, WITN reports.

Those in attendance held candles while some of their tears were momentarily broken to sing one of Bennett's favorite songs: Wagon Wheel by Old Crow Medicine Show.

'He had success written all over him,' Bretty Wynne, a graduate assistant in intramural sports where Bennett worked also told the station.

He described him as 'just one of the rare personalities you come across. Enjoyable personality, just somebody who really brightened your day every time you saw him and it's just sad to see him go.'
