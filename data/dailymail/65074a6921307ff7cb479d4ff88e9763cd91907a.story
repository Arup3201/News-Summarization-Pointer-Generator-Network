Paul Clitheroe said talking about financial issues was one of the key to healthy relationship

Not only is he one of Australia's most respected financial advisers but he has been married for 32 years - so he knows a thing or two about juggling a healthy marriage and money matters. 

So what is Paul Clitheroe's key to a successful relationship? Talking to your partner about financial issues openly and honestly.

Clitheroe says knowing about your family's financial situation could also make separation easier and save you money if the relationship turns sour.

Clitheroe, who is a regular contributor on Channel 9, shares his tips in his new book - Money, Marriage and Divorce - which is a manual to help navigate the tricky topic.

The 59-year-old told Daily Mail Australia it was never too early in a relationship to approach the subject.

'Like any normal couple, [my wife and I] have our arguments, we both have different money attitudes but we have spoken about it ever since we started dating,' Clitheroe said.

'If you can start to talk about money, if you can keep doing that, you have better chance [of staying together].'

In his book, Clitheroe shares his advice on what to expect when you separate or get divorced from your partner.

He said it was important not to fall into the trap that your experience would be like someone else's who was in a similar situation.

'In a perfect world you'd be able to go into the divorce process, where you may need mediator, and come to agreement relatively quickly,' Clitheroe said.

'But every divorce is personal and completely individual. The reality is that you can have a very similar circumstances, but could get different outcomes because of different attitudes to divorce.

'It can become very emotional and very illogical.

'I do see couples who fight so bitterly over money and at times you sometimes find there's hardly enough money to split at the end.'

Clitheroe said in these situations it was best to come to a compromise, adding it was also important for both parties to understand and know about the family's financial affairs as it makes the process 'more comfortable'. 

'I saw a situation recently where a couple, after legal negotiations, he would get 52% and she would get 48%,' he said.

'They went onto fight in court for two years and fighting about principle and spent over a million dollars in legal fees. 

'They both know they were going to financial losers, but they wanted to get out of the divorce as the winner. 

'A lot of this stuff is a lot about emotional things like that the dog is yours or the vase is yours but it's really difficult to split these things in half. 

'We know it doesn't make sense but people spend a lot of money wanting to come out a winner.'

The financial adviser also believes both parties in a relationship should understand their financial affairs

Drawing from research done by Relationships Australia, Clitheroe said there were three primary danger zones for relationships.

They are the seven-year itch, the 40s and the silvers - which is where Clitheroe and his wife lie on the spectrum going into their 60s.

In his book, the adviser focuses on the 40s as the median age for divorce in females is 42.2 years and in males it is 44.8 years, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures.

Divorce rates are also rising in couples over 50 and Clithroe said it made sense that these periods of life were a dangerous time for marriage as it was a period where couples were placed under a lot of pressure.

'Society has very high expectations about living, with holidays, mortgages, kids are expensive - so there's a lot of work pressure. Probably both parties are working to support very big mortgage these days,' Clitheroe said.

'So it's not surprisingly you're not spending time together because you're working hard.'

In his book, Clitheroe said women were often hit hard during a separation or divorce.

'Both parties to a couple can expect a significant change in their financial wellbeing,' he wrote.

'Looking purely for financial issues, women generally fare worse - at least in the early years following separation.'

Clitheroe points to a 2012 study by the Australian Institute of Family studies that said women suffered more because most became primary caregivers to children, which made it more challenging for them to further their career and take on part-time work. This means their superannuation diminishes.

Debunking some myths  

Myth 1: It wasn’t my fault, therefore I'll get more

Let’s debunk this myth right now. Even if you view your spouse as being at fault for the breakdown of the relationship (or vice versa), this will not impact the way property is divided between you.  

The idea that you did nothing wrong so you should receive a greater share of your combined assets is a common misconception – possibly fuelled by soap-opera scriptwriters who see fit to have a jilted spouse declare, ‘I’ll take you to the cleaners for this!’ Prior to 1975, the reason for divorce may have been considered in a property settlement – an unfaithful spouse, for example, may have been awarded a smaller slice of the matrimonial pie. But that’s not the case these days.

This may seem extremely unfair, especially if, for instance, your other half has been unfaithful while you’ve devoted ten, 20 or 30 years of your life to supporting his or her career, raising the children and looking after the family in general. Nonetheless, that’s how the law stands, and you can’t bank on the circumstances of your break-up leading to a property settlement that leans in your favour.

Myth 2: The kids will live with me, so I’ll be entitled to the lion’s share of the assets

The role of family law today is to determine a fair and reasonable financial outcome for separating couples and to ensure any parenting arrangements are in your children’s best interests. 

Bearing this in mind, you cannot assume your ex will simply go along with whatever parenting agreement you suggest. Nor is it sensible to second-guess how the property or assets you’ve acquired during your relationship will be divided. 

This will be determined through negotiation with your former spouse – and hopefully not the intervention of the family law courts – a potentially very drawn-out and expensive process.

Myth 3: Everything will be divided equally

The property settlement process has a number of stages. 

The first involves identifying and valuing all the assets (including superannuation), as well as liabilities belonging jointly and individually to each member of a couple. Both parties have a legal duty to make full and frank disclosure about their financial situation: if you believe your ex could be hiding assets, you need to speak with your lawyer. When it comes to assets like businesses, it’s possible to arrange a market valuation from professional valuers or accountants.

The second stage is to assess the contributions each party made to those assets. You don’t have to be a working spouse to add value here. Contributions can be monetary, but your efforts as a parent or homemaker will also be considered. Don’t feel you’ll be disadvantaged if you gave up your own career to raise a family.

The next step of a property settlement will normally involve making an adjustment for the future needs of each party. This can take into account differences like health, age and income, as well as care of children.

The fourth and final stage is looking at the overall result to check that it is ‘just and equitable’ – the standard benchmark used by family law courts.

Again, there is no hard and fast rule about who gets what. Nor is there a single calculation that determines how assets are divided – if there were, I’d provide it here. Each case is judged, and determined, on its individual circumstances.
