Police responding to a report about a loud party in Florida arrested an 18-year-old girl for allegedly serving alcohol to underage friends - while her mother was hiding in a bedroom.

Mariel Weinand, 18, has been charged with one count of having an open house party in connection to the Tuesday incident.

Her mother, 56-year-old real estate agent Carolyn Weinand, has been hit with 26 counts of selling, giving or serving alcohol to people younger than age 21, and a single count of hosting an open house party.

Animal house: Police discovered beers and cans containing alcohol strewn throughout the Weinands' home in the 500 block of Starboard Drive in Naples, Florida

Sloshed: Police observed that when Mariel came to the door, she was so drunk that two friends had to prop her up

It all started at around midnight Tuesday when the Weinands' neighbor in Naples called police to report an out-of-control gathering taking place in their home in the 500 block of Starboard Drive, the station NBC2 reported.

When officers arrived on the scene, they witnessed some 20 party-goers scurrying inside the house, locking the doors and switching off the lights in a failed bid to fool police into thinking that no one was home.

Mariel Weinand eventually came out to talk to the officers, who observed that that the petite, 5-foot-1 blonde was so drunk that she had to be propped up by two friends.

Shocking find: As police were searching the house for Mariel's guests, they discovered her mother (center) hiding in a bedroom

The 18-year-old reportedly told police that the house belonged to her realtor mother, who was out of town that night.

When police reached Mrs Weinand on the phone, the 56-year-old woman said that she was away and knew nothing about the party, but gave officers permission to clear her home.

Inside, police said they found bottles and cans containing alcohol littering the property, along with a small amount of marijuana outside.

Excuses: Mrs Weinand told officers she thought she was keeping her daughter (pictured) and her friends safe by hosting the party in her home

As the responding officers were searching the premises for Weinand's guests, they came across none other than then teen's mother hiding in the bedroom – even though she was supposed to be out of town.

Carolyn Weinand came clean that she was aware of the soiree and said she thought she was keeping her daughter and the girl's friends safe by hosting the party in her house and not allowing the teens to drink and drive.

The 56-year-old mother also admitted that she knew that alcohol was being served to minors, but denied buying it for the party.
