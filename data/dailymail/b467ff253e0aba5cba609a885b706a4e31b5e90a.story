Southampton and England striker Rickie 
Lambert looks poised to join his boyhood club Liverpool, who released 
him as a 15-year-old. We asked Steve Grant of fan website SaintsWeb whether the deal represents good business for the south coast club.

Is it any wonder that many clubs appear to not actually be trying to achieve genuine success when the end result is either bankruptcy (in the case of our near neighbours Portsmouth) or a circling of vultures from the upper echelons of the league eager to stop you in your tracks and acquire the fruits of your own hard labour?

At the time of writing, of course, not a single player has yet been sold, but the writing appears very much on the wall, and a whole host of talent looks likely to be leaving St Mary's this summer, along with manager Mauricio Pochettino.

While the majority of the fans are disappointed with Pochettino's departure to Spurs, we also realise that we held a broadly similar outlook when he first arrived on these shores. What I don't think any of us were expecting, though, was such a feeding frenzy on the playing squad.

As a club we have always tended to drive a hard bargain when pressured into selling players, even when Rupert Lowe was chairman, and the one major sale under Nicola Cortese's reign (Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Arsenal) was also a deal where everyone believed we'd done pretty well.

All of this is in stark contrast to what appears to be a done deal to take Rickie Lambert back to where it all began at Liverpool.

Lambert, along with Adam Lallana and Morgan Schneiderlin, represent the progress we have made as a club from being in the doldrums in League One, and his departure may even hurt more than a home-grown talent like Lallana leaving.

He embodies all that is good about our club, and yet whoever is in charge of these decisions in the absence of a manager appears to have been played by one of the oldest negotiating tricks in the book, with the club now likely to be taken for a ride.

Target: Liverpool are still in talks with Southampton for £30million-rated Adam Lallana

Gone: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take charge at St Mary's this week

£4million plus add-ons (what exactly are they?) for a 32-year-old with no pace may seem like a good deal on the face of it, but he has been the figurehead of the system that has been so widely and rightly showered with praise over the course of this season, and I challenge anybody to find a player who can contribute 10 plus goals and 10 plus assists a season in the top flight for that amount of money.

Liverpool have played our board like a fiddle with empty ultimatums to get the deal done before the World Cup. There isn't another player like Lambert, Liverpool aren't suddenly going to run out of money or change their transfer approach over the space of a month, and yet we've danced to their tune.

All of that wonders who is actually making the decisions. The chairman stated barely 48 hours ago that no players would be bought or sold until a new manager was appointed, and yet either he or Les Reed, the only club director with any experience in the game, fell for Liverpool's game hook, line and sinker.

Somebody needs to let the fans know what's going on. It even sounds like somebody needs to let the players know what's going on as well! While it's never been plain sailing for Southampton Football Club, I don't think we've ever shot ourselves in the foot to this degree before. It's time for answers...
