If you think the recent bad weather has been a struggle, spare a thought for poor Rachel Prince.

The 26-year-old is trapped indoors every time it rains due to a rare condition that means she’s allergic to water.

As such, Miss Prince, from Ripley, Derbyshire, has been unable to go outside for the past month because a single drop will cause a painful itchy red rash.

Rain, rain go away: The recent stormy weather has been Rachel Prince's worst nightmare because she suffers from an extremely rare allergy to water

'It makes me feel like my skin is on fire': Miss Prince can't even seek comfort from her fiance Lee Warwick (right) because the saliva from his kiss brings her out in a painful rash

Recent weather conditions - some of the wettest to hit the UK in 200 years - have seen Rachel housebound.

And she can't even seek comfort from her fiance Lee Warwick, 28, because the saliva from a kiss also causes a reaction.

Rachel’s condition, Aquagenic pruritis, means even a few drops of saliva from Lee could bring out an extremely itchy prickling-like rash.

The allergy also means she cannot go for long baths or even drink a cold glass of water as it makes her throat swell up whenever she takes a sip.

The condition is so rare it’s believed Rachel is one of only about 35 people in the world who suffer from it.

Frustrating: Her allergy also means she cannot take long showers or baths without suffering a reaction

Struggle: Miss Prince first noticed the allergy when she was 12 and the rash has gradually got worse over the years

Rachel, who is an artist, said: 'I never 
go out without checking the weather and because of the recent amount of 
rainfall we’ve had, I’ve been indoors a lot which I hate.

'A single drop of rainfall can give me a painful allergic reaction that can last a few hours.

'I always go out with a coat that has a big hood on it, as well as an umbrella, just in case it does suddenly rain.

'I’ve been staying in a lot lately which is so boring and depressing as I want to go out but I just can’t - it’s not worth the risk.

'It’s so painful and red, I’ve experienced people staring at me when an allergic reaction happens in a public place.'

Learning to cope: Miss Prince has managed to adapt to daily life with her partner Lee Warwick

After coming into contact with water - or blood, sweat and tears - a person with Aquagenic Urticaria develops painful, itchy hives that spread over the affected area.

These can last anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour-and-a-half and some sufferers have to lie down to let the pain subside.

Investigators believe the hives are not caused by a histamine release but are the result of extreme skin sensitivity to additives in water such as chlorine.

The condition is extremely rare and is thought to affect around 35 known people in the world and there is no proven treatment.

Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists said: 'Aquagenic might be associated with elevated blood histamine levels, but there are other processes at work and we do not yet fully understand the precise mechanisms that trigger the itchy rash.

'As the disorder is very rare, there may be other reasons for your symptoms - for example an allergy to a bathing product, so accurate diagnosis is the first step.'

Rachel first noticed the allergy aged 12 and as she became older the rash worsened, making it almost impossible for her to be in contact with water without experiencing pain.

She said: 'The rash makes me feel as though my skin is on fire and it itches as though I have a nettle rash.

'I find it hard to drink anything too cold as it really hurts my throat and makes it feel uncomfortable and as though it’s going to close.

'For some reason juice and tea are easier to drink but I don’t know why as they have water in too.

'Because my condition is so rare no-one has ever heard of it, some doctors have also refused to believe I’m suffering from an allergy to water because it’s that rare.

'I’m even allergic to sweat and tears - including my own blood when it gets in contact with my skin.

'I used to love going swimming when I was younger but I can’t do that anymore, I’d love nothing more than being able to paddle my feet in the sea.'

Despite Rachel’s painful condition, she has managed to adapt to daily life with her partner Lee and says that the allergy even has some positives.

She said: 'It’s not all bad as it does get me out of doing any washing up as if water touched my hands for a long period of time I would be in a lot of pain.'

But there is a plus side! Miss Prince says it's not all bad because she gets out of doing the washing up
