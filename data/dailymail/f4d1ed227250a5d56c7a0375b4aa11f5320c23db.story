She once dismissed the idea of a ‘Strictly Come Dancing curse’, despite several competitors ending their relationships after falling for their dance partners.

However, it seems Rachel Riley has now joined their ranks after starting a relationship with the professional dancer she partnered on the BBC show last year.

Russian-born Pasha Kovalev, 34, confirmed that he has been seeing the 28-year-old – best-known as the resident maths genius on Channel 4 quiz Countdown – since early summer.

Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev in London: A Strictly source said: 'They always had a natural chemistry'

Head over heels: Rachel Riley's Strictly Come Dancing partner Pasha Kovalev has confirmed they started dating this year following her split from husband Jamie Gilbert

He said they started their 
relationship after Miss Riley split with her husband Jamie Gilbert, whom
 she met while at Oxford University.

Yesterday
 pictures were published of Miss Riley and Mr Kovalev strolling and 
chatting before going into Miss Riley’s £600,000 home in West London. 
They later left separately.’

When
 Mr Kovalev was asked if their relationship had started in early summer,
 after her marriage ended, he told The Sun: ‘That’s what happened.

He added: ‘I don’t want to make any personal comment. I would like people to focus on the show. It’s going to be brilliant.’

Confirmation: Dancer Pasha has revealed that he started dating Rachel after the breakdown of her marriage

Serious chat: The pair looked deep in conversation as they entered Rachel's home

Coincidence? The pair were spotted together just hours before Pasha was paired up with Caroline Flack on the launch of this year's Strictly Come Dancing

As
 luck would have it, the pictures appeared only hours before the opening
 episode of the latest series of Strictly was broadcast on BBC1 last 
night.

Mr Kovalev, who this 
year will partner broadcaster Caroline Flack, and Miss Riley were the 
source of much speculation when they danced together on Strictly.

A 
source close to the show said: ‘Pasha and Rachel always had a natural 
chemistry. You could see that they had a soft spot for each other when 
they were on the show.

Dance diva: Rachel, seen here with Pasha, left Strictly Come Dancing after six weeks in the competition but their chemistry was hard to ignore

‘When
 Rachel separated from her husband we suspected something would happen 
between the two of them and it was always a case of when, not if.’

Another
 source close to the dancers said: ‘Rachel and Pasha kept in touch 
post-Strictly and he became a shoulder for her to cry on as her marriage
 broke down.

‘Her career 
has not progressed as she would have liked and no doubt having Pasha on 
her arm will help to raise her profile again now the series has 
started.’

Miss Riley met Mr 
Gilbert at  the age of 19 when both were  students. Their marriage 
lasted only 16 months before they split – her heavy work schedule was 
blamed and she said no one else was involved.

Speaking
 about Strictly, she told the Daily Telegraph this year: ‘It’s tough on a
 relationship because it’s so full-on and all-absorbing yet it’s 
something your real-life partner can’t be a part of. I don’t think 
there’s a Strictly curse, but it does serve as a magnifying glass that 
shows up pre-existing fault lines.’

In
 2007, dancer Flavia Cacace got together with show partner Matt Di 
Angelo, ending her romance with Vincent Simone. The next year Mr Simone 
admitted cheating on his pregnant girlfriend with dancer Kristina 
Rihanoff. In 2009 Miss Rihanoff denied having an affair with boxer Joe 
Calzaghe, but moved in with him after he left his girlfriend. They have 
since split.

Miss Riley and her agent could not be reached for comment yesterday.
