Families have been urged to boost their health in the New Year by abandoning fatty and sugary foods in favour of slimline alternatives.

A new Government campaign claims that if the average family replaces fizzy drinks with sugar-free alternatives, it will cut sugar consumption by three quarters of a bag in just a month.

And drinking semi-skimmed instead of whole milk can reduce fat intake by the equivalent of a third of a pint.

Campaign: Change4Life is issuing new adverts to urge families to switch to healthier food and drink

The Change4Life 'Smart Swaps' campaign, launched to coincide with the start of 2014, also encourages people to use low-fat alternatives to cheese and butter.

Breakfast cereal is another target of the initiative, with families urged to cut out sugary treats in the morning and replace them with healthier options.

Public Health England, which is behind the campaign, insists that eating healthily need not be more expensive, and is offering vouchers for low-fat and sugar-free foods to encourage families to change their habits.

'Swapping like-for-like food in our diet could help cut out surprising levels of saturated fat, sugar and ultimately calories without having to give up the kinds of food we like,' said Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE.

'We all eat too much saturated fat and sugar which can increase our calorie intake. Together this increases our risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers.

'We're committed to doing as much as possible to support families to make these swaps, which is why I'm pleased to announce that hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of offers will be available to those who sign up to Smart Swaps and in store across hundreds of shops in England.'

Public health minister Jane Ellison added: 'We know how difficult it can be to make big changes to your diet which is why this new Change4Life campaign suggests small changes as a step in the right direction.

'With over 60 per cent of adults and a third of 10- and 11-year-olds overweight or obese, it is really important that we keep helping people make better choices about their diet.'

However, the fizzy drinks industry has criticised the new campaign, claiming it gives a 'deliberately negative' and distorted picture of their products.

'We are disappointed that for the second year in succession this campaign heavily targets soft drinks which provide just two per cent of the calories in the average adult diet in the UK,' said Gavin Partington of the British Soft Drinks Association.
