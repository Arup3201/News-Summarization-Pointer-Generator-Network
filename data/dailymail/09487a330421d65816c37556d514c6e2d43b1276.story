Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle has become the latest player to withdraw from the Germany squad after falling ill.

Mesut Ozil, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Marco Reus and Sami Khedira are all missing for Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland, and now Schurrle has been added to that list.

A statement from the German Football Association read: 'Andre Schurrle has caught a cold and will not be available for the game against Republic of Ireland tonight.

The Chelsea man joins a growing list of injured German players which also includes Arsenal's Mesut Ozil

'The Chelsea attacker has already departed from the team hotel in Essen.' 

The 27-year-old faces considerable competition to start for both club and country, but believes Jose Mourinho is the perfect manager to help him fulfil his potential.

'Jose Mourinho has taught me a different style of play and a different way of thinking to reach the world-class level someday,' Schurrle told SportBild. 

'To him, finishing second is a failure. He doesn't know the word 'losing'. That's how he holds his talk before the matches. His thinking is impressive - as impressive as the way he gets his message across.

'He challenges you to be robust on the pitch, to play like a man. To commit a foul. I feel much better since joining Chelsea and I have become much more confident.' 

Schurrle featured in all but one of Germany's matches as they won the World Cup in Brazil

The 27-year-old said his time at Chelsea under Jose Mourinho has made him improve as a player
