Gunman: Michael Atherton shot dead three women then turned the gun on himself at a house in Horden, Peterlee, on New Year's Day

Police seized triple killer Michael Atherton’s shotguns three years ago – but returned them to him because they did not think he posed a danger.

Officers removed six guns from Atherton’s home amid concerns for his mental health after he threatened to shoot himself.

But he successfully applied for their return simply by denying that he had ever felt suicidal.

Yesterday MPs said the decision on removing guns should not be left solely to the discretion of a police officer and must involve a health professional as well as checks with the owner’s partner.

Atherton, 42, shot his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, shortly after returning home from a pub late on New Year’s Day.

Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry said Atherton and his partner of 19 years had gone out separately and ‘an argument took place’ on their return to the semi-detached house in Greenside Avenue, Peterlee, County Durham.

He said: ‘Mr Atherton produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead Susan, Tanya and Alison before turning the gun on himself.’

The women’s bodies were found in the kitchen and living room and a shotgun was by Atherton’s side.

The killer’s stepdaughter Laura McGoldrick, 19, was slightly wounded and escaped from the house by climbing out of a first-floor window.

Friends said the once ‘happy-go-lucky’  family man had been depressed about a heart problem.Neighbour Jean Gray, 74, said both Atherton and Mrs McGoldrick were ‘very good neighbours’.

She added: ‘I couldn’t say anything bad about either of them. He was a happy-go-lucky person and very well liked.

‘I just don’t know what happened to him. He must have snapped somehow.’

Killed: Tanya Turnbull, 24, left, was blasted to death on New Year's Day and right, Susan McGoldrick who was also shot death by Atherton who had licences for six firearms

Shot dead: The latest victim of Michael Atherton to be named is Alison 
Turnbull, left. She died alongside her daughter Tanya, right, who at 24 was the 
youngest of the three killed in the New Year's Day tragedy

Atherton was a keen angler before taking up game shooting several years ago.

Elaine Wilkinson, a friend who runs a fishing tackle shop, said Mrs McGoldrick phoned her last year to ask for advice because Atherton was refusing to get treatment for a heart problem. Mrs Wilkinson’s husband, Bert, died three years ago from a heart attack.

‘She was really worried about Mick, she was on about his heart and the fact that he wasn’t doing anything about it,’ she said. ‘He was a very friendly chap on the outside but I don’t know what he was like between the four walls of his house.

‘He had suffered from depression for 
quite a while, I think. I don’t know if that’s got something to do with 
this. They were both hot-headed but very nice people.’

Police
have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints  
Committee over the decision to return three licensed shotguns and three 
‘high-powered’ firearms, believed to be rifles, after Atherton 
threatened to shoot himself in 2008.

Grahame
Morris, Labour MP for Easington, said: ‘At the time the police took his
firearms from him and he applied to have them returned. Police made an 
assessment and they were returned to him.’ Durham Police confirmed 
that the weapons were taken from Mr Atherton’s house as a precaution, 
but as he insisted there had been no threat to harm himself, the weapons
were returned.

Shot at close range: Susan McGoldrick, circled bottom right, the partner of gunman Michael Atherton, was killed in the massacre; the identities of her friends in this image is not known

That 
decision followed national procedure, a force spokesman said. ‘It was 
one person’s word against another,’ he said. ‘If there were no grounds 
for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be 
returned to the firearms licence holder.’

Commenting
on firearms regulations, Mr Morris said: ‘At the moment it is fairly 
subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment 
of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms 
licence.

‘My view is 
there should be some input from a suitably qualified health care 
professional. Secondly, I also wonder whether it is reasonable to keep 
firearms in a domestic situation.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said the law ‘should be simplified, clarified and made consistent’.

Escape: Laura McGoldrick, pictured at her 18th birthday party, was shot during the incident but managed to escape by climbing through a window

Desperate: Drenched in blood and hysterical, Laura, pictured, pounded on the door of a neighbour's house

He
said it would be ‘appropriate’ for the Government to look at gun laws 
in Canada where the partners of gun licence applicants are  contacted in
advance of a licence being issued.

Friends
have paid tribute to the victims on the internet. Mrs McGoldrick was a 
popular figure in the local supermarket where she worked, Miss Turnbull 
was an Avon Lady who also worked in a shoe shop and her mother Alison 
was described as a ‘lovely woman’.

Martin Peel, who knew Atherton  since his school days, said: ‘He was completely sane except for that one night.

‘No one could imagine he would do something like this. I am devastated and grieving.’
