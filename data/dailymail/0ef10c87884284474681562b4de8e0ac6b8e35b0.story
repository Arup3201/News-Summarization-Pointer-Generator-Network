Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini's composed exterior hasn't necessarily extended to the dressing room during his side's recent stumble in form, reveals Sergio Aguero.

After three losses in their past four games the defending Premier League champions' players have 'been told what for' behind closed doors, says the Argentine.

'Manuel is calm on the touchlines, but that isn't to say that when we get in the dressing room at half-time or after a match, that he isn't the first to give us what for,' Aguero said.

Sergio Aguero says Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini can blow his top at times

Pellegrini is usually calmness personified pitchside but when the doors are closed he erupts, says Aguero

West Ham away - LOST 2-1

Newcastle at home - LOST 2-0

Manchester United at home - WON 1-0

CSKA Moscow at home - LOST 2-1

'I'm not going to tell you exactly what he says, but he doesn't hold back.' 

If ever there was a case for Chilean Pellegrini to blow his top it was Wednesday night as City imploded at the Etihad, falling to Russia's CSKA Moscow to leave their Champions League campaign in tatters. 

Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were sent off and Aguero was booked for diving in the 2-1 loss that puts City at the bottom of Group E behind CSKA Moscow and Roma, with Bayern Munich cruising to top the group with two games remaining before the knock-out phase.

City have an opportunity to regain some confidence with back-to-back wins in the Premier League, following last week's 1-0 result against Manchester United, when they face QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday (kick-off 5.30pm).

Any clash with the hoops brings back memories of Aguero twirling his shirt in celebration after scoring the goal that snatched the 2012 title from Manchester United.  

Aguero has a picture of that moment hanging on his wall at home.

‘Whenever you mention the words “Queens Park Rangers” it always comes to mind,’ he said. ‘That will remain etched on my memory for ever. I’ve watched it back loads and loads of times, as you can imagine.’
