Wayne Rooney has backed Roy Hodgson to
 take England into Euro 2016 and apologised to fans for the early exit 
in Brazil - but says that the team have to become more streetwise if 
they want to become a force in major tournaments.

Rooney
 supports the attacking style and introduction of young players that 
Hodgson has used in Brazil, saying he believes the strategy will pay 
dividends in the future.

Key moment: Uruguay's Diego Godin was fortunate to escape a second booking for foul on Daniel Sturridge with the score 0-0

But he also says England need to learn from the
 Uruguayans and become less naive in the way they play the game.

Rooney
 said: 'If you look at teams who have won the tournament in previous 
years, you can see that nastiness in them. I think we need to get that 
in us. Maybe we're too honest.

'Uruguay stopped the game; they 
committed I don't know how many fouls - clever fouls which slowed the 
game down. I think we're a bit honest in terms of the way we play.

'It's small margins, but those small things can amount to a big thing in terms of staying in the competition or going out.'

Asked
 whether Daniel Sturridge might have made more of the elbow to this 
throat by Uruguay's Diego Godin, who was already on a yellow card, 
during Thursday's 2-1 defeat, Rooney said: 'Of course. You see players 
surrounding the referees - I'm not saying Uruguay did that - but I'm the
 same now. I want to win the game.

Hurting: Wayne Rooney admitted the players were disappointed by early World Cup exit

'I
 got kicked 10 times and I don't think there was a yellow card given to 
an opponent. That's what I mean. We tend to get up and try to get on 
with the game as quick as we can.

'Maybe
 that's a fault, maybe that's where other teams are ahead of us. But we 
gave everything to try to win games. But there are a lot of young lads 
who want to play every minute. I think at times we could have slowed the
 game down a bit or taken control of the game a bit more. But this is 
football. You have to take your chances.'

Despite the disappointment, Rooney believes Hodgson was right to take a positive approach to games in Brazil.

'If you look over the previous two or three tournaments, we've not attacked teams, we've been cautious,' he said.

'In other tournaments we've wondered if we could have done things differently once we were out, but we've had a go here. It's just not gone our way.'

England goalkeeper Joe Hart admits it will be a long three weeks while the World Cup goes on without England.

Hodgson's side still have to play 
Costa Rica on Tuesday but the Manchester City keeper says it will be 
tougher to take after the squad have travelled home and started their 
holidays.

'It will be really
 difficult,' said Hart. 'The World Cup will be everywhere, no matter 
where we are in the world, a reminder of where we could have been.

'We've no-one else to blame. We could have changed that, but we haven't. It'll play on our minds, but we have to move on.

'It's
 the worst I have felt. I have a strange, empty feeling. I have put 
everything into this tournament but ultimately I'm gutted.'

Hart admitted that there are no easy explanations for the defeats against Italy and Uruguay - sides that Costa Rica managed to beat. He said: 'It's a good question. They've been tough games for Costa Rica and they've come out on the right side. We've had two tough games and come out on the wrong side. It's a simple question but a tough one to answer.'

For Hart, whose World Cup appeared to 
be in jeopardy when he was dropped by club manager Manuel Pellegrini 
last year but who battled back to become City's No 1 and win the Premier
 League title, said he and the squad would take lessons from Brazil.

He said: 'I want to keep improving, trying to take the best of every situation, good and bad.

'We've
 had some high ones, some very good ones. But this was my first World 
Cup playing, and it's not gone to plan. But there are things I can take 
from it, technical and personal things.'
