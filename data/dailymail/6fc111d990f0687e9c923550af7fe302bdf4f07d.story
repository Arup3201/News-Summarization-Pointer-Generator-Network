The Pittsburgh Steelers ended last season without Le'Veon Bell and it seems they'll start the new one without their stud running back too.

Bell will miss the first three games for abusing the league's substance abuse policy and he will also be fined a game cheque.

Bell was stopped in his Chevrolet Camaro last August after a police officer noticed a strong smell of marijuana.

Le'Veon Bell will appeal the NFL's decision to ban him for the first three games of the season

LeGarrette Blount will miss the first game of the new season after being charged with marijuana possession

Former Steeler LeGarrette Blount and a female passenger were also in the car and the pair were charged with marijuana possession. Bell was also charged with a DUI.

Blount - who was waived by Pittsburgh, joined the Patriots in November and went on to win the Super Bowl - was banned for the first game of the season earlier this week. Bell plans to appeal the decision, says ESPN's Adam Schefter who broke the story.

Bell had 2,215 all-purpose yards, 11 touchdowns and made the All-Pro team last season.

The Steelers signed veteran running back DeAngelo Williams in free agency and he looks likely to cover for 23-year-old Bell.
