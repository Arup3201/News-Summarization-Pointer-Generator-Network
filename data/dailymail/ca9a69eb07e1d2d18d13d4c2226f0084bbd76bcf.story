Two men were arrested in Oklahoma on Monday for breaking into an apartment and using a carpet staple gun to staple a homeowner's lips together, authorities say.

Police were called to the Windsor Village Apartments in Tulsa about 1:15 a.m. Monday to respond to an armed robbery that had occurred moments earlier.

The robbery victims told police that three men kicked down the back door to their apartment and held four residents - including a 2-year-old child - at gunpoint and demanded they hand over drugs, cash and other valuables.

The suspects then bound the victims with duct tape as they robbed the apartment.

The victims, however, recognized two of the men who had broken into their home, and identified them to police as 21-year-old Angel Rodriguez, 21 and 19-year-old Mario Mediano. The victims told police that the men had lived next door to them in the apartment complex, but they had been evicted after one of the victims reported them for using drugs,.

The alleged thugs made off with multiple phones, tablets, a purse, wallets and then fled the scene in a stolen 2012 black Dodge Challenger, police said.

Before fleeing in the stolen car, authorities say the men stapled one of the victim's lips together with the staple gun.

'Apparently, these people reported drug use and thatâ€™s why the suspects 
were initially evicted from next door,' Tulsa Police Department Cpl. Brandon Disney told KFOR. 'One of the victims tonight had a 
staple from a carpet staple gun put in his face, on his upper lip, so 
two small puncture marks. EMSA removed that.'

He says the stapling of the victim's lips could have served as a warning to the victims to not cooperate with police. 

Nobody else in the home was injured. 

After the three suspects left the house, authorities used social media to track them down after Rodriguez posted on Facebook that he was heading to a nearby Whataburger.

Rodriguez and Mediano were arrested at th Whataburger about 3 a.m. The third suspect, described as a white male, about 5-foot-6 and 180 pounds remains at-large.

Rodriguez and Mediano likely will be charged with first-degree robbery, armed robbery and other charges relating to the stolen vehicle.
