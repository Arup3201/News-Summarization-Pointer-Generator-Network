Mothers aged 30 to 34 gave birth to more babies than any other age group last year, new figures have revealed today.

A maternity services report, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, said almost a third of babies delivered in 2013-14 had a mother in this age group.

Overall, 646,900 babies were born in NHS hospitals in the past year - the smallest number ever recorded since 2006- 07.

There was a noticeable reduction in the number of young mothers giving birth, the report said.

Women aged 30-34 gave birth to more babies last year than any other age group, new figures show 

In 2013-14, mothers aged 15 to 19 years old gave birth to 26,300 babies - a 14 per cent reduction compared to the previous year.

Deliveries to mothers aged 20 to 24 were also reduced by 8.6 per cent  to 110,000.

The report also revealed the numbers of babies being delivered by C-section has steadily increased since 2011-12, a trend the Royal College of Midwives has described as 'concerning'.

More than 26 per cent of babies were born by Caesarean in 2013-14, a 0.6 percentage point increase on 2012-13 and a 1.2 percentage point increase on 2011-12.

London hospitals were more likely to deliver babies by C-section than those in other parts of the country.

In the capital, almost 29 per cent were delivered this way.

And West Yorkshire hospitals had the lowest proportion of C-section births - just 22 per cent.

In turn, they had the highest proportion of spontaneous births, where a baby is delivered without the need for forceps, vacuum, or any other instruments.

More than 67 per cent of births in West Yorkshire hospitals were born this way, while London hospitals had the lowest proportion of spontaneous deliveries, at nearly 57 per cent.

Across the country, nearly 61 per cent of all births were spontaneous. 

Figures published by the ONS yesterday showed rates of conception for women aged 35 to 39 rose fastest in 2013, compared to all other age groups. The statistics show teenage conceptions have fallen to their lowest rate since records began in 1969

The figures come a day after statistics from the ONS revealed rates of conception for women aged 35 to 39 rose fastest in 2013, compared to all other age groups.

The number of teenage mothers conceiving fell to the lowest level in more than 40 years. 

Growing numbers of women are giving birth by Caesarean section, a report revealed today.

The numbers of babies by C-section has steadily increased since 2011-12, according to Health and Social Care Information Center data.

The Royal College of Midwives says the rise is 'concerning' and the major surgical procedure 'should not be undertaken lightly'.

The figures show more than 26 per cent of babies were born by Caesarean in 2013-14, a 0.6 percentage point increase on 2012-13 and a 1.2 percentage point increase on 2011-12.

London hospitals had the greatest proportion of babies - almost 29 per cent - delivered by C-section.

And West Yorkshire hospitals had the lowest proportion of births - almost 22 per cent - delivered by Caesarean.

Commenting on the report, Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at The Royal College of Midwives, said: 'We are concerned by yet another increase in the Caesarean section rate, which is steadily climbing. 

Some are, of course, needed for medical reasons. However, this is a major surgical procedure for mother and baby that should not be undertaken without serious consideration.

'There is increasing evidence about the negative implications for women and their babies of having a Caesarean section.

We support NICE recommendations on this issue. These say health professionals should review and discuss this thoroughly with women who want a Caesarean section that is not medically necessary. 

A decision to have a Caesarean section should not be taken lightly. 

Experts warned yesterday that a growing number of women are delaying motherhood as they prioritise their careers.

Balancing concerns over the cost of raising a child, uncertainty over job security and unstable relationships are increasingly causing women to delay having a baby, they said. 

They added that while pregnancy and childbirth in later life can present challenges, women should not be pressured into having children before they are ready.

Rather, the health service must ensure maternity services are tailored to meet the needs of an increasingly ageing population of expectant mothers.

Last year, ONS figures revealed that the average age of first-time mothers had risen above 30 for the first time, increasing by four years since the 1970s. 

This year's figures revealed the conception rate for women aged 35 to 39 increased to 64.5 conceptions per thousand women - almost doubling since 1990, according to the Office for National Statistics figures.

Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at bpas (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) told MailOnline: 'There are many reasons for this, not least the time it takes to achieve financial stability and establish a career.

'Women are often warned about leaving it too late to start trying for a baby, but this really needs to be kept in perspective.

'Pregnancy and childbirth for older women can present particular challenges, but rather than pressuring women into having children earlier than they feel is right for them, we need to ensure maternity services are in place to deliver the care they need.'  

A spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said while women must be supported in their decisions about when to plan having a child, they 'need to know how fertility and pregnancy outcomes change with age'.

Biologically the optimum childbearing age is between 20 and 35 years old, the RCOG said.

But they warn after the age of 35, 'it is increasingly difficult to fall pregnant, and the change of miscarriage rises'.

RCOG spokesman, Dr Patrick O'Brien, said: 'The growing trend of women delaying motherhood until their late thirties or early forties is, we believe, an inevitable one, because of the increasing equality in the social, professional, financial and corporate environment that we live in.

'The average age of fatherhood has also been rising.

'It is the role of healthcare professionals, including the RCOG and its members, to ensure that all women are made aware of the potential risks of having pregnancies in later life, so that they have an informed choice when doing so.' 

It comes as teenage pregnancy rates for women aged 15 to 17 fell to 24.5 conceptions per thousand of the population - the lowest rate since 1969.

The growing trend of having children later in life is becoming the norm, as women prioritise their education and careers. And in deciding when to embark on motherhood, financial worries, uncertainty over job security and unstable relationships are increasingly causing women to delay family life, experts said

The figures show a 13 per cent drop in the estimated number of conceptions for women under 18 in 2013, down to 24,306 in 2013 compared with 27,834 in 2012. 

For the under-16s, there was also a 14 per cent drop in the number of conceptions - an estimate of 4,648 in 2013, compared with 5,432 in 2012.

Overall, for women aged under 35 conception rates fell in 2013, compared with the previous year. 

Teenage pregnancy rates have fallen to their lowest rates since 1969.

The latest ONS figures reveal for women aged 15 to 17 fell to 24.5 conceptions per thousand of the population.  

The figures show a 13 per cent drop in the estimated number of conceptions for women under 18 in 2013, down to 24,306 in 2013 compared with 27,834 in 2012. 

For the under-16s, there was also a 14 per cent drop in the number of conceptions - an estimate of 4,648 in 2013, compared with 5,432 in 2012. 

The ONS believed the drop in the number of under-age pregnancies could be explained by several factors, including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments.

The Government has included the under 18 teenage conception rate as one of its three sexual health indicators in its Public Health Outcomes Framework, and it is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty. 

Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England (PHE), said: 'Young people who have the highest rate of unplanned pregnancy and teenage parenthood can be at risk of a range of poor outcomes, such as poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty, so it is vital this downward trend is continued.'

He said one of PHE's seven national priorities is 'ensuring every child has the best start in life'. 

Public health experts hailed the fall in teenage conception rates, adding it proves 'young people's sexual health can be improved if they receive the right support'. 

In 2013, overall conceptions in women of all ages fell slightly, with an estimated 872,849 conceptions compared with 884,748 in 2012 - a decrease of 1.3 per cent.   

Conception estimates include all pregnancies that lead to a maternity leading to birth or stillbirth, or an abortion.

Teenage pregnancy rates and early motherhood is significant, as it is linked to poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation, poverty and related factors, the ONS note. 

The ONS believed the drop in the number of under-age pregnancies could be explained by several factors, including the improved programmes of sex and relationship education introduced by successive governments.

Its report also stated that it could be due to a 'shift in aspirations of young women towards education' or the 'perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother'. 

The Government has included the under 18 teenage conception rate as one of its three sexual health indicators in its Public Health Outcomes Framework, and it is one of the national measures of progress on child poverty. 

Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England (PHE), welcomed the fall in teenage conception rates.

He said: 'Young people who have the highest rate of unplanned pregnancy and teenage parenthood can be at risk of a range of poor outcomes, such as poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty, so it is vital this downward trend is continued.'

He said one of PHE's seven national priorities is 'ensuring every child has the best start in life', adding the authority are committed to working with local government to further reduce teenage conception rates 'because we know this is generally better for both parents and children'. 

Health experts have hailed the fall in teenage conceptions, noting early motherhood increases a teenage girls' risk of poor educational achievement, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and poverty
