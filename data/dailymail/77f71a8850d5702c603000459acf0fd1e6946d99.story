At first glance this just looks like an ordinary woman wearing an, albeit very skinny, pair of jeans.

But look a little closer and you'll see she's actually wearing nothing from the waist down, save for a tiny G-string.

The French model allowed her her pal, make-up artist Marie "Marie P" Przybylski to paint on a pair of trusty blue jeans and then she went outside for a stroll.

Paired with a bra and shirt tied at the waist, the model, also named Marie, walked the streets of Lille in France, much to the confusion of onlookers.

The idea was thought up by students Sarah Baboro and David Lesage, who study PR at a school in Belgium.

Their homework assignment was to create a 'Buzz video' for their final exam - that is, one that would generate a lot of views and publicity.

And we hope they got top marks because they certainly fulfilled their brief.

The pair recruited make-up artist Marie P, who took two hours creating the faded blue jeans on Marie's legs using body paint.

She said: 'I said yes because Sarah is a good friend of mine and body-painting is what I really enjoy as a make-up artist so I didn't even think twice about saying yes!

'It sounded like fun and I really really really enjoyed doing it.

'The model, Marie, is a friend of Sarah's too.'

Despite a couple of long stares, most people seemed not to notice the semi-nude woman standing right in 
front of them.

In a video of the event, which featured on Nerve, Marie paints the model all over her legs, groin and bum.

The shots are fast-tracked so you can see the transformation happening in just a couple of minutes.

The
 model then smiles, twirls and poses for the camera in just her bra and 
'jeans,' then confidentaly takes to the streets of Lille.

As
 the camera follows her journey she clearly gets a few stares from passers by, though it's unclear whether this is because 
they've caught onto the fact she's wearing painted on jeans and nothing 
else, or if they are simply admiring an attractive women in a 
tight-fitting pair of trousers.

And she's off! The model walks out onto the street with her painted jeans and a shirt on and onto the streets of Lille in France
