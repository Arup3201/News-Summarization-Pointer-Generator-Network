Father: The son of Sir Nicholas Mostyn QC (pictured), one of Britain's top judges, possessed cocaine and ecstasy, a panel heard

The trainee barrister son of a former top divorce lawyer was caught with cocaine and ecstasy just weeks after being called to the Bar, a legal disciplinary panel heard today.

Henry Mostyn, whose father Sir Nicholas was dubbed ‘Mr Payout‘ for his big money settlements, was arrested by police as he queued for an east London nightclub.

Officers let the former Eton schoolboy and Oxford graduate off with a caution. But the Bar’s disciplinary tribunal officially reprimanded him and ordered him to pay £605 in fines and costs for his ‘lamentable lack of judgment’.

The 25-year-old lawyer is one of four children of Mr Justice Mostyn and his ex-wife Lucy.

As a divorce lawyer Sir Nicholas charged up to £500 an hour representing the rich and famous, with clients including Sir Paul McCartney and Earl Spencer, before becoming a family court judge.

The QC, 54, walked out on his wife in 2010 to live with divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders, 42. Her barrister husband Mark was shot dead by police marksmen during a siege off the King's Road in Chelsea in 2008.

Mr Justice Mostyn was set to have his own 31-year marriage examined in a court battle with his former wife, 53, over their assets, including the nine-bedroom £6million family home in a 117-acre estate in Hertfordshire.

But earlier this month the couple settled out of court and are understood to have agreed how to divide their assets, including the magnificent 18th Century Grade II-listed property.

Henry Mostyn was called to the Bar in October 2011 and accepted as a pupil at prestigious London chambers 4 New Square.

But in December he was arrested and held in a police cell after being searched by officers outside the nightclub.

Police calculated the street value of the drugs was £40 before letting Mostyn off with a caution, the legal tribunal heard.

Following his arrest he admitted the drugs were his and later confessed to his new colleagues. His chambers has since decided not to discipline him.

Handing him the official reprimand for professional misconduct, Judge Julia Dias, QC, said:’ This is a very sad case.

‘You are very young and at the very start of your career, and have no doubt suffered very greatly already through the whole experience of being arrested, taken to the cells, and fingerprinted.

‘You are a pupil in a prestigious set of chambers, and four months ago you had a very promising career in front of you. I’ve absolutely no doubt you worked very hard to achieve that.

‘But the exercise of judgement is one of the most important qualities a barrister can possess.

‘Unfortunately, you demonstrated what can only be described as a lamentable lack of judgement.

‘You are a member of a profession which is expected to adhere to higher standards than ordinary members of the public.’

She said there was nothing to suggest Mostyn would have planned to ‘renounce the occasional use of recreational drugs’ had he not been caught.

‘The inference must be that, if you were not apprehended on this occasion, you would have continued to use them in the future.’

Richard Todd, QC, defending, had earlier asked for the Press to be excluded from the hearing because publicity would represent a ‘quadruple jeopardy’ for the young lawyer.

Mr Todd added: ‘He most certainly has learned his lesson from the foolishness of his behaviour.

‘Everybody in his chambers is aware.

‘The caution itself has an impact - it will have a bearing on future applications, whether for [crown court] recorder or Queen’s Counsel.

‘It is going to have an impact on visas and a very lucrative line of work - working overseas.

‘Mr Mostyn wants to work in the commercial work and it may well be he’ll have to forget about that.’

In a statement read to the hearing, Mostyn - described as ‘ outstanding’ on his chamber’s website for his law school work before joining them - said he now realised taking drugs was ‘irresponsible and immature’ and vowed.

He added: ‘This behaviour will not be repeated.’

Mr Todd said the pupil barrister had a record of ‘developing and using his skills for the benefit of the wider community’, having volunteered for charity work.

In an August 2010 newspaper interview about his work at a former chapel in King's Cross helping former offenders get an education, Mostyn described his concern on his first tutoring visit when he encountered ‘a table with a pile of £50 notes, a huge bag of cannabis and wraps of other drugs’.

He said it was ‘a little worrying, but it later emerged that these were only props for a play the ex-cons were putting on.’

Another newspaper feature on the project described Mostyn as ‘what you might call typically posh, with floppy hair and the eagerness to please of a new puppy’.

Mostyn is quoted in the article as describing one ex-con, called Rikki, as 'so charming, so bright in a way that we are not. He'd been in and out of prison and had such a different life to my incredibly privileged upbringing'.
