Caught out: Charlie Fisher with Becky Connery this year

The three girlfriends of a cheating supermarket worker decided to humiliate him in public after realising he had slept with all of them within 24 hours.

Becky Connery, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham and a third girl, who does not wish to be named, confronted Charlie Fisher, 20, when they discovered he had been triple-timing them for months.

The Mail reported earlier this week how they ambushed him at Luton Airport, shouting ‘cheat’ and ‘liar’, when he returned from a holiday in Germany.

But Miss Connery, 17, a student from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, yesterday revealed how the trio hatched the plan after realising the extent of his deceit.

She told MailOnline: ‘We are pretty sure that he slept with us all in one day, which is disgusting. I spoke to Lizzie and the other girl and we realised that Charlie had had sex with me one morning, then with Lizzie that afternoon, then the other one at her house the day after.’

‘I don’t know why we did it. He was boring, and we all agreed he wasn’t great in bed.’

Mr Fisher, from Hatfield, was rumbled when A-level pupil Miss Connery, who was at his house the night before he went on holiday, picked up his phone and saw a message from a girl saying ‘I will meet you later’.

It made her suspicious because, she said, he had asked her to go home early that night because he had to finish his packing.

She explained: ‘He said, “She’s just a friend”, but the next day after he flew to Germany I found her on Twitter and messaged her.

‘We arranged to meet in a pub, and it turned out that she, like me, had had her suspicions. I’d been seeing him since March and she had been seeing him since January.’

They then met the other girl after contacting her on Facebook. ‘It turned out that she thought she was Charlie’s girlfriend, too. We couldn’t believe it,’ Miss Connery said.

Becky Connery, 17, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham, 19, and the third girl, 20, (L-R) all had relationships with him

Mr Fisher, pictured with Becky earlier this year, juggled excuses and pet names to avoid being rumbled 

Miss Leeland-Cunningham, 19, a bar supervisor from Watford, said: ‘When I met him in April Charlie seemed so perfect, he really did.

‘But when we all looked back, we could see how he’d done it. When he left my house he’d never let me walk him down to his car, saying he wanted to listen to his music on his headphones. He’d meet another girl at the end of my road.’

But their moment of revenge was sweet. Miss Connery said: ‘He came round the corner and just froze. He didn’t know what to say. His face just dropped. It hit the floor.’ 

As the girls chanted ‘Liar, liar’, and asked him to explain himself, Mr Fisher fled with his grandmother, who he had persuaded to collect him.

Miss Leeland-Cunningham said: ‘Charlie carried on walking past us because he had no other way of getting out.

‘We looked at each other and thought, ‘‘what?” so we followed him saying, “Do you not have anything to say for yourself?” 

‘He couldn’t believe it, and didn’t know what to say.’

However, the story does have a happy ending. The three women are now friends.

Mr Fisher, who has not replied to MailOnline's attempts to contact him, is no longer seeing any of the girls and,despite initial attempts to win them back, has not been in touch.
