Liverpool have confirmed Jordon Ibe has returned to Anfield following a successful loan spell at Championship outfit Derby County.

Ibe, who has made 24 appearances for Steve McClaren's side, has scored five goals during the course of the season.   

And it appears he will not be shipped out elsewhere, with Liverpool keen on keeping the youngster at Anfield for the time-being.

The Reds, who currently occupy eighth spot in the Premier League, have struggled for form during the first half of the season.

Ibe joined Liverpool from Wycombe in 2012, but has only made two Premier League appearances for Brendan Rodgers' side.

He was first loaned out to Birmingham, before heading to the iPro Stadium this season.
