A woman and her boyfriend were mown down in a jealous attack by her obsessed love rival, who used her car as a weapon to drag them 40 metres along the road in a horrific attack.

Sonita Claire smashed into Kevin O'Neill - the father of her child - and Mary Jane Kimble at 30mph, hitting them from behind as they walked hand-in-hand on a busy Derby street. 

Miss Kimble needed 22 stitches and her hair, scalp and blood were left on the bonnet of Claire's car, while her boyfriend Mr O'Neill suffered a broken neck and collar bone.

But despite the 'horror movie-style attack'  the couple, from Derby - who were both struck while Claire drove at 30mph towards them - are now engaged to be married and expecting a child together.

Miss Kimble, 34, said that when she was first told what had happened to them after waking from a two-day coma she did not believe it.

'It sounded like the plot of a thriller movie,' she said. 'We were left unconscious in pools of blood.

'Kev had a broken neck and collar bone and I needed 22 stitches in my head.

Claire, kitchen worker Mr O'Neill, and Miss Kimble had been caught in a 'love triangle' which had left Claire 'bitter and hurt', a court had previously heard.

Mr O'Neill had first been in a relationship with Miss Kimble, and the couple had a child together, 

But Miss Kimble said she became close to Claire, 28, in 2007 after her relationship with Mr O'Neill ended when their daughter Lily was around 15 months old.

Mr O'Neill started seeing Claire, a waitress at the bar where he worked, and Miss Kimble lost contact with both of them . 

But it was during this relationship that Claire, 28, started a dangerous obsession with Miss Kimble, and later secretly pretended that she and Mr O'Neill had split so she could befriend her love rival. 

A heavily pregnant Claire stopped Miss Kimble in the street, and told her she had split with Mr O'Neill and wanted their children – who would be half-siblings – to be close.

Over the next seven years the pair became 'inseparable', with Miss Kimble and Claire bonding over their shared experiences.  

But it emerged that Claire was lying and had never split with Mr O'Neill. 

Miss Kimble only discovered the truth during a chance meeting with her ex-partner in the dentist – when he told her he had only recently spilt up with Claire.

He also revealed Claire had become obsessed with Miss Kimble and lied about having passed on messages to Mr O'Neill from her.

When Miss Kimble found out and got back together with Mr O'Neill, Claire – furious with jealousy – ran them both over.

Claire, an aspiring actress from Derby, was jailed for seven years after she appeared at Nottingham Crown Court in January 2014.

She admitted two counts of grievous bodily harm with intent.

Judge Michael Stokes QC told her: 'Heaven has no rage like love turned to hatred, nor hell a woman like a woman scorned.'

Miss Kimble recalled how she met Mr O'Neill  in 2002. 'He had sparkly eyes and cheeky grin,' she said.

'Friends and family reckoned it wouldn't last. We got engaged and although we didn't get round to planning the wedding, three happy years on, in January 2005, we had a daughter Lily.

'One evening, I took our baby girl to see Kev at the bar where he worked as a bouncer. Walking in, I noticed a pretty waitress chatting away to him. Kev told me she was called Sonita.

'He said she had a thing for him. But then he said, "She's got nothing on you".'

Miss Kimble said problems started emerging around this time with Mr O'Neill spending less time at home.

When their daughter was 15 months old in 2007 they separated.

She continued: 'We didn't part on good terms and lost all contact. I heard through mutual friends that he'd started dating Sonita. It was months later when I came face-to-face with Sonita – she had a huge bump.'

Miss Kimble said Claire told her she was Mr O'Neill's girlfriend and their child was due in a week.

She continued: 'Six months later I bumped into her again. This time she was pushing a pram.

'She told me things were over with her and Kev. I felt sorry for her as I knew how tough it was being a single mum.

'So I arranged a play-date with her and a few weeks later she came round. She told me she had been sleeping with Kev when we were still together.

'I felt the wind knocked out of me, but we stayed friends. Years went by and Sonita and I became inseparable.

'Her and her boy would come for sleepovers and we'd gossip into the early hours over a glass of wine.'

Miss Kimble said in January 2013 she told Claire she was planning to get back in touch with Mr O'Neill.

'I told her Lily needed her dad,' she said. 'Sonita kindly offered to pass on my messages, but I heard nothing from Kev. But one day in the dentist I bumped in with him.

'He told me he'd just broken up with Sonita. He said she'd become fixated on me.

'I was confused because Sonita had said they'd broken up seven years ago.'

Mr O'Neill told Miss Kimble this was not the case – and explained the reason for their break up.

'He said Sonita had got weird,' she said. 'He said she had started dressing like me and was obsessed with us getting back together.

'I called Sonita and she admitted the truth. She said, 'I wanted to tell you but couldn't find the right time'.

'I told her she was crazy. After that Kev came round regularly to see Lily and the old feelings came back.

'We started dating and were happy. But Sonita bombarded me with abusive messages every day, even started waiting outside Lily's school. One day she texted, "I'm going to run you over".

'She sent Kev the same thing.'

The pair were on the way to the police station to report the messages on October 6, 2013 when they were hit.

'I heard a car speeding up behind us,' Miss Kimble said. 'Then everything went black.

'The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital, my mum at my side.'

The couple underwent treatment with Mr O'Neill needing surgery on his neck.

They were in court to see Claire jailed.

'Now I'm pregnant again, and Kev and I are planning our wedding,' Miss Kimble said. 'This time it's forever.'
