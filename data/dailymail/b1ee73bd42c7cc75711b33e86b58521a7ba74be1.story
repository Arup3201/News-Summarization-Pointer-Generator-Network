A royal blue lobster has been saved from the boiling pot thanks to his rare colouring.

Steve Harrison, from Aberdaron, was sorting through his catch when he spotted a lobster with a royal blue shell among the other regular lobsters in the pot. 

It was a unusual discovery - only one in two million lobsters can have a mutation that allows them to have a blue outer shell.

Mr Harrison, who has fished on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, for 32 years, said: 'I'd caught blue ones before but never one so blue'

Mr Harrison, who has fished on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd, for 32 years, said: 'I noticed a flash of blue when I pulled the lobster pots up and as I looked in I saw it was a blue lobster.

'I’d caught blue ones before but never one so blue.

'It’s not often you see blue lobsters and even this one’s antenna was blue so it was a very rare catch.

'I was going to sell it but re-considered as I thought it was too rare to just give away so I decided to keep it in the tank in our fish and chip shop in Aberdaron.

'Its colour has faded slightly since it’s been in the tank but it’s very popular, a lot of people come in just to see it!'

Normally appearing brown or dark green in nature prior to boiling, scientists
 say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic 
defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein.

The blue lobster is no different to a regular lobster - it is only the mutation which influences the lobsters
 outer shell colour.

Scientists say just one lobster in two million is blue - the result of a genetic defect that causes them to produce an excessive amount of protein.

The blue lobster is no different from the regular lobster-  it’s only the mutation which influences the lobsters outer shell colour.

They can be found any place where regular lobsters are found.

A research study conducted by Professor Ronald Christensen, at the University of Connecticut, USA, found that excessive levels of a protein combines with a red caratenoid molecule known as astaxanthin, forming a blue complex known as crustacyanin.  It is this that makes the lobster blue.

In 2006 lobsterman David Percy caught a yellow lobster near Whaleback Island in the US at the mouth of the Kennebec River.

The odds of finding a yellow lobster are approximately 1 in 30 million.

It is estimated that only about one in 100 million lobsters are albino - lacking in coloured pigments. They are known as 'white' or 'crystal' lobsters.

They can be found any place where regular lobsters are found.

In 2008 a rare blue lobster was found off the Isle of Man and in 2012 another fisherman caught one off the coast of Nova Scotia.

According to researchers at 
the University of Maine Lobster Institute lobsters have been found in 
even more rare colours than blue.

According to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, one-out-of-10 million lobsters are found in a bright red colour.

Even
 rarer, however, are yellow and calico lobsters - speckled with yellows 
and oranges - which both have an estimated one-in-30 million chance of 
finding.

Mr Harrison said he is now planning to release it back into the ocean at the end of the summer.

The blue lobster was not the only spectacular catch Mr Harrison has made in the last month.

He also caught a monster lobster, weighing in a whopping nine pounds.

'The big lobster weighed in around nine pounds, its claws were huge and it’s definitely the biggest one I’ve seen in a while.

'I
 wasn’t too sure what to do with it but then I was contacted by the 
School of Ocean Sciences at Bangor University who have now tagged it and
 it’s been released back into the ocean,' added Mr Harrison.
