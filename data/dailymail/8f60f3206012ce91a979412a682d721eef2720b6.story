Former Galatasaray manager Roberto Mancini has refused to confirm his interest in replacing Laurent Blanc as manager of French champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Some reports have linked the ex-Manchester City boss with a move to the Parc des Princes, with Blanc under pressure following a mixed start to the Ligue 1 season.

But Mancini insists he has not been contacted about the role and that PSG already have a talented manager at the helm.

Mancini is free to join a new club after leaving the Turkish side in June after less than a season in charge

Speaking at a forum in Qatar, Mancini said: 'I think there is a good coach there. [Blanc] runs PSG well and he won the French league last year.

'I know nothing more. Maybe I will coach in France - or somewhere else. Everything is possible in football.'

The 49-year-old left Turkish side Galatasaray in June just one season into a three-year contract.
