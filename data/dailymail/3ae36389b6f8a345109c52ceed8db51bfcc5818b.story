Smoke alarms have a tendency to be triggered by something as simple as burning toast, which means you're left waving a towel frantically in front of the sensor to silence the shrieking noise.

The smart alarm from Nest Lab has been designed to put an end to this debacle, but 'without compromising on protection'.

Called Nest Protect, the device will give a spoken Heads-Up warning that can be silenced by a wave of the hand before sounding a traditional warning alarm. It can also be linked to mobile devices and can warn homeowners even when they're out.

Nest Protect has built-in heat, carbon monoxide and smoke sensors.

If Nest Protect sees that smoke or carbon monoxide levels are rising but have not yet reached emergency levels, it will give an early warning. This can be silenced by a wave of a hand.

Nest Protect connects to mobiles over Wi-Fi and will text homeowners to warn them of danger, or when the batteries are low.

In an emergency, the What to Do feature reminds users of recommended actions and gives a one-button access to an emergency phone number.

Additionally, if a homeowner fits 
multiple alarms in different rooms of a house, Nest Protect can alert them to which room in particular the danger has been detected in.

This may not be necessary when detecting smoke from a fire, but has been designed to warn specifically for the dangers of carbon monoxide.

'We’ve all experienced the smoke alarm going off while we’re cooking or searched for the source of that incessant low-battery chirp in the middle of the night,' said Tony Fadell, Nest founder and chief executive officer.

'Every time a smoke alarm cries wolf, we trust it a little less, and then - in a moment of frustration - we rip the batteries out to stop the beeping. And that leaves us and our families at risk.'

Nest Protect goes on sale in November and costs £109. It will come in two versions - a wired 230V device as well as a battery-powered alarm

Studies have shown that 80 per cent of homes in the UK own a smoke alarm, but in one of eight house fires attended by fire and rescue services, had smoke alarms that failed to work.

This is largely caused due to flat or missing batteries that have been removed because of chirping alerts.

'Safety shouldn’t be annoying,' added Matt Rogers, Nest founder and vice president of engineering.

'It was unacceptable to us that one in eight houses in the UK have a non-functioning smoke alarm.

'These products are required by law and are supposed to keep us safe, yet people hate them. We wanted to change that.'

The Nest app is available on iOS, Android and online, and can also be used with smart Nest Learning Thermostat. 

It is due to go on sale in November and will cost £109. It will also come in two versions - a wired 230V device as well as a battery-powered alarm.
