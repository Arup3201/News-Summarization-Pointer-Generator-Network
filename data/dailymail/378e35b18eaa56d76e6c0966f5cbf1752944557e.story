The thought of building flat-pack furniture is enough to bring some people out in a cold sweat.

But despite it being seen by many as a chore, a team of students have turned the tedious task into an online game.

The game is called Home Improvisation and its makers describe it as the ‘world’s most fun and accurate co-operative furniture assembly experience.’

The game was made by students Aj Kolenc, Jessica Jackson, Colton Spross and Josh Faubel as part of the 2015 Global Game Jam in Atlanta.

Collectively the students are known as The Stork Burnt Down.  

At the start of the game, players are given a box of flat-pack furniture but the instructions are missing.

The player has to figure out how to build the furniture and can experiment by snapping the pegs and different parts into the holes.

Its developers added: ‘Make sure to invite some friends over and make the beautiful furniture of your dreams.

Ikea - the Swedish home store - has built an app that adds a keyboard to a smartphone. 

It lets users send house-related emoticons such as storage units, stools, toilets, and even a plate of Swedish meatballs. 

The free app is available on Android from the Google Play Store.  

‘Or labour alone and slowly descend into madness!’

Pieces are locked into place using a standard keyboard or an Xbox 360 controller.

The spacebar or A button is used to pick up and drop the pieces, while the WASD key and left stick move the furniture and the arrow keys and right stick rotate it.

The team have made the game available online and are using it to raise money for the Tony Tseng memorial fund - a professor who died shortly before the Game Jam event.

A video tutorial shows how to play the game, and it is available for Windows and Macs.
