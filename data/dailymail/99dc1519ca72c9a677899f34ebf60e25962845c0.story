After hordes of trick-or-treating children enjoyed the hottest Halloween on record at 16C yesterday - Britain is set for a frostier Bonfire Night with temperatures expected to plummet as low as -3C.

Yesterday, freak weather saw people sunbathing in Brighton while Gravesend, London and Charlwood, Surrey, both had temperatures above 23C, smashing the 46-year-old national record.

But the Met Office predict a return to traditional November weather in the next few days - culminating in a 'crisp and chilly' Guy Fawkes Night on November 5.

Simon Patridge, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'We may see temperatures fall to as low as -3C on Bonfire Night in some valleys in the Scottish Highlands. 

'In sheltered inland areas of England and Wales we expect to see low temperatures of around -1C while in London it's more like 2C.'

This is a staggering 14C lower than the temperature in the capital last night. 

Mr Partridge added: 'But it will be clear and crisp with light winds - which really is perfect weather for Bonfire Night.

'From Monday, the weather will start to feel normal for November and there will certainly be a marked difference from the unusually warm nights we have been experiencing. 

'Last night the temperature in London was 16C so it's a big drop. 

'Thursday will turn wet and windy in the West with heavy rain and strong to gale-force winds possible.

'Thereafter, to November 14, unsettled and windy weather from the west is most likely, with spells of rain pushing across the country interspersed with showery, colder days.'  

On Thursday an ice rink in London started to melt just hours after it had opened. 

The skating rink outside the Natural History Museum in South Kensington turned into slush as temperatures hovered just below 20C.

Visitors to the rink, where family tickets start at £36, were left disappointed by the watery conditions of the ice rink - which is open until 4 January.

Meanwhile, supermarket giant Tesco said the weather had prompted record October barbecue and party food sales.  

While most of the UK should stay dry for most of tomorrow, there is a chance of light, isolated showers, according to the Met Office.

And London and the South East could see temperatures as low as 13C on Monday - marking an eight-degree fall over the weekend.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said yesterday: 'The start of November will feel like a big change after the mild conditions in October, but the drop in temperature will be fairly gradual so we will ease into it.

'We could see some frost in Scotland and snow in the Highlands next week.'
