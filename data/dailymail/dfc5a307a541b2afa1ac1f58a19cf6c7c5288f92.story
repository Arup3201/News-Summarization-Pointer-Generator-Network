Kingman remained on course to take on 2013 winner Toronado in Wednesday's Qipco Group One Sussex Stakes as Glorious Goodwood turned on the taps.

Clerk of the course Seamus Buckley was due to irrigate ‘about 75 per cent of the course’ which had turned good to firm under the baking sun on day one of the meeting.

The Sussex Stakes is already down to four runners after War Command, one of Aidan O’Brien’s two entries, was pulled out lame.

Foregone conclusion? Royal Ascot winner Kingman will take some beating in the Qipco Sussex Stakes

With John Gosden-trained Kingman having had a chip from an ankle joint removed last year, there were fears that owner Khaled Abdullah might pull out his Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Palace Stakes winner.

Those concerns were heightened when Ed Dunlop’s White Nile slipped and fractured a knee in the Bet365 Summer Handicap, won by Andrew Balding’s Van Percy.

But Abdullah’s racing manager Lord Grimthorpe said: ‘The intention remains to run as long as it is not rock hard. Then there would have to be a discussion but hopefully they will be watering the course.’

Whether Paul Hanagan, White Nile’s jockey, will play any further part at the meeting is dependent on X-rays he was due to have on his left arm last night. After inconclusive assessment at the track, he flew back to Newmarket with his arm in a sling.

Gone with the wind: Trainer Richard Hannon is hoping Tornado can change his fortunes at Goodwood

The fall has already cost the rider, who won Saturday’s King George at Ascot on Taghrooda, a winner with Tom Queally deputising on Inxile in the Casino at Bet365 Handicap. Hanagan is due to ride Taghrooda in next month’s Yorkshire Oaks.

Meanwhile, Toronado’s trainer Richard Hannon will hope for better fortune on day two after having two odds-on favourites beaten.

Beacon was twice hampered when third to Charlie Hills’s Cotai Glory in the Molecomb Stakes but Toormore travelled well before being beaten fair and square in the Lennox Stakes by Clive Cox’s Es Que Love. The latter’s jockey Adam Kirby is facing a lengthy ban over his use of the whip.
