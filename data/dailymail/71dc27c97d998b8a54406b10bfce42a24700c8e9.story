Turbulent relationship: Angie Bowie with the singer and son Zowie, now Duncan Jones, in February 1974 at a Hotel in Amsterdam

It has been lauded by critics as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of pop. But David Bowie's return has failed to impress his ex-wife, who has called his latest material 'diabolical'.

Angie Bowie, who was married to the singer for ten years, has dismissed his new album, claiming he hasn't written a good song since 1974. She said: 'I listened to the first single  – Where Are We Now? – and it was just awful, just diabolical. The second one was worse than that.

'This is supposed to be the greatest comeback of the century? It's boring. I think every release since the first eight albums has been rubbish.'

Bowie's album, The Next Day, is released today. Where Are We Now? was released in January to the surprise of fans who believed the 66-year-old star had retired after a heart attack in 2004.

Tilda Swinton plays the singer's lover in the video for second single The Stars (Are Out Tonight).

Bowie fans have speculated that the character is based on Angie and their turbulent relationship.

However, the 63-year-old former model, who lives in the US, said: 'I watched 30 seconds and couldn't cope with any more. The subject matter is too retrospective.

'I am pleased he got out of his house in New York and recorded an album. 
But why has he been sitting in his house for ten years anyway?'

The couple married in 1970, having met in the 1960s when she was studying at Kingston Polytechnic and Bowie was trying to get a record deal.

She claims they almost missed the ceremony after being up most of the night before enjoying a threesome with a mutual female friend.

She said: 'David was big on threesomes with both men and women - the whole nine yards. And I was right in there.

'The night before our wedding it was a mutual friend of ours. We went 
out for dinner, back to her place and had plenty of lively sex. We had a
very late night and didn't go to bed until 3am or 4am.

'Then we woke up late in north London and had to be in Bromley by 10am 
to get married. We just about got there in time and staggered in.

'It was a bullsh*t romance. When he asked me to marry him, he said, 'And
I don't love you, by the way.'

'He had told me before we married he 
didn't love me, so of course he was not going to be faithful. As it was 
the Sixties I suppose they called it free love.'

Angie, who now works as a journalist 
specialising in transgender issues, also spoke about the morning she 
allegedly caught her husband and Rolling Stones frontman Mick together 
in the marital bed of their home in Chelsea in 1973.

Boring? David Bowie's much-anticipated new album The Next Day is released today

She said: 'They were not only in bed together, they were naked. I walked
into the bedroom and David was there with all these pillows and duvets 
on top of him and on the other side of the bed was Mick's leg sticking 
out.

'I said: 'Did you guys have a good night?'. They were so hung over 
they could hardly speak. I took pity on them.'

Angie claimed Bowie's fascination with Mick came from his desire to 
'seduce' all his major rock rivals, saying: 'In our living room as we 
watched Top Of The Pops, David was constantly wanting The Rolling Stones
to move over to the States.

'He decided he would seduce him like he 
seduced any competition. But I don't think it was a big love affair with
Mick. It was probably more drunken pawing.'

Break up: Angie says she £500,000 from Bowie, paid over ten years, after the couple broke up

They went on to have son Duncan together, but split in 1980. She then had a daughter Stacia with punk musician Drew Blood while Bowie has been married to model wife Iman, 57, for 20 years.

After the couple divorced in 1980, Angie says she received £500,000 from Bowie - paid over ten years.

'It was in tiny installments - like a child with an allowance - I couldn't even buy a house.

'When I broke up with David I didn't recover for six years for him not paying me for managing him. Maybe I never got over it.'
