Federal MP George Christensen has received a death threat after posting a controversial Twitter comment regarding the budget on Thursday.

The LNP member for the Queensland electorate of Dawson suggested that people who were unhappy with the tough budget measures, should try living in Asia before they complained.

'Aussies should do tour of Asia & live like locals to put these 1st world complaints re budget in perspective,' Mr Christensen’s tweet read on  Thursday.

Federal LNP member George Christensen reported a death threat to the federal police on Monday, which he received after posting a controversial tweet telling Budget complainers to 'tour Asia' on Thursday

The generalised comment which verged on racism, also included a picture of impoverished Asian children in a slum background for added effect.

Furious with the distasteful comment, dozens of Twitter users fired back with their own tweets labeling the comment as shameful.

Greens member Adam Bandt was one of the many repliers, writing 'Or, @GChristensenMP, why don't you live 6 mths in Aust on no income (as u want under 30s to) & tell us how you get on'.

Others rebuked Mr Christensen by criticising the budget’s $7.8 billion worth of cuts to foreign aid over five years, suggesting a reversal to alleviate the poverty problems the MP was pointing out.

Unaffected by the backlash, the Queensland MP defended his tweet with a simple: 'Sometimes truth hurts’ while accusing 'the lefty twitter warriors' of going into meltdown.

Mr Christensen also personally addressed a number of critics on the site, telling one that budget whingers' complaints were minuscule on a global scale.

'Try getting any serious form of welfare in Thailand or other SE Asian nations,' he replied to another.

But things took a far more sinister turn when Mr Christensen revealed via twitter that he had received a death threat regarding his original post.

The anonymous email, which Mr Christensen said he took to federal police on Friday, warned that MPs in Asian countries are assassinated and was accompanied by a photo of a man whose head has been blown off.

'Just remember arsewipe, those Asian countries also have a high number of MP (sic) that are assassinated. Aussies have GUNS.. Just remember that!' the email said.

'You have just become a MARK!'

In an interview with the AAP, Mr Christensen revealed he didn't expect that his tweet would lead to such a serious and dangerous reaction.

'It's probably the most confronting email I've ever received,' he said.

'You receive nasty emails (as an MP)... I have a thick enough skin for that but I don't have a thick enough skin to stop a bullet from going through my head.'

Mr Christensen also claimed anger about the budget was unwarranted, and debate about it needed to be brought down to a 'sensible level'.

'I think everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down about it,' he said.

Within his tweet informing followers that he'd received the threat, Mr Christensen also wrote that the Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, was 'fanning this violence'.

A spokeswoman for Mr Shorten described the remark as a 'disgusting new low' for the Liberal Party.

'If the prime minister has any sense, he'd instruct George Christensen to apologise for this offensive and irresponsible statement,' she said.

'There is a right way and a wrong way to protest this unfair budget - making threats like this is never acceptable.'
