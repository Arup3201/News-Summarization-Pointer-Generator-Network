Are you frequently left hunting through your handbag for a pen only to come up empty-handed? Not for much longer if the inventor of the Jackpen has his way.

Enraged after being unable to find a pen for the umpteenth time, inventor Andrew Jewson came up with the novel idea of shrinking a ballpoint pen to the size of a headphone jack.

The tiny result can be slipped into your smartphone, which, Jewson hopes, will mean no one will ever be left scrabbling for a pen again.

Clever: The ballpoint pen has been shrunk to 20mm and slots into the headphone jack on a smartphone

Jewson, 50, from Oxfordshire, says that the 20mm gadget has been designed to slot nib side into smartphones as well as the reverse to ensure no ink leaks into your pocket or your handbag.

He added: 'The small size and critical tolerances 
have meant many different prototypes were built, tried and tested.

'The 
ink is viscous ballpoint ink to ensure against leakage, and it maximises
writing capacity equivalent to drawing a line 30 metres long.

'The 
ink reservoir runs the entire length of the pen, with a small hole at 
the end for breathing.'

Tidy: The Jackpen is designed to slot both ways into the jack so you don't end up with an inky bag or pockets

Inventive: Creator Andrew Jewson, 50, hopes that the Jackpen will put an end to being caught without a pen

The pen, which can be bought from Fenwicks or from service station branches of WH Smith, costs £3.99 for a pack of three.

'I found the whole process of inventing the 
Jackpen exciting, but not without it’s frustrations,' added Jewson.

'I’ve invested a 
shed-load of energy, time and money, it’s been a real journey.'
