A British man who was caught by an undercover agent posing as the father of an underage girl has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Shuhel Mahboob Ali told the 'father' online that he wanted to have sex with her and raise a 'daughters-only' family so that he could carry out a sick incest fantasy.

Ali believed that the agent was arranging for him to be set up with his daughter, and Ali told how he wanted to 'settle down with a girl and raise a couple of daughters for "the lifestyle,"' according to the criminal complaint.

From January to April 2013, Ali communicated with the undercover agent online and described in harrowing detail how he would abuse their fictitious children.

He said that 'once the mid-wife left' he would begin to sexually assault their daughter.

'When you start with very, very, very young, you can mold them to believe anything and do anything you see,' he said according to the criminal complaint obtained by the Orlando Sentinel.

He planned to travel to Florida, meet the teen and then bring her back to the United Kingdom where he would 'begin to train her sexually and prepare her for a family'.

Ali flew from London to Sanford, Florida in April and then met the agent when he was expecting to meet the father of his would-be bride.

He was arrested near Titusville by agents from the Department of Homeland Security and local sheriff's deputies. He was then taken into custody in North Brevard County.

Police found bondage tape, two hooded face masks, condoms and cameras in his bag as well as a computer which contained child pornography.

Ali pleaded guilty to enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity.

His 10 year sentence, which will be spent in a federal prison, was handed down on Monday.

'It is truly unimaginable that monsters exist and walk among us with the purpose of victimizing our most precious citizens,' Sheriff Wayne Ivey said at the time of his arrest.

'I want this message to be absolutely crystal clear: We will use every lawful resource we have in our possession to find and remove you from society if you try to harm a child, no matter where you may be on this planet.'
