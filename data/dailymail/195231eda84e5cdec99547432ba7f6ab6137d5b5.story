Business travellers who are looking for some peace and quiet at Gatwick Airport can now rent a tiny workspace for £12 per half hour.

Regus has opened two ‘workpods’ in the airport’s south terminal for those who need to write a report, video conference with colleagues or catch up on emails while waiting for their flight.

From the outside the pods look like modern photo booths, but they are private work stations designed to cater to a professional’s every need, including wifi, a desk and chair, mobile device chargers, computer screen and a telephone to make calls within the UK.

Booking a workpod is as simple as hiring a Boris Bike in central London.

Travellers simply have to use their credit card on the spot or fill out an online form on Regus' website, with every half hour costing £10 plus £2 VAT.

The workpods are situated airside at the airport in Crawley, West Sussex, and are part of the Luxembourg-based company’s Regus Express rollout, which provides work stations at airports, including Heathrow, rail stations, hotels and retail outlets.

Workpods will open at Gatwick’s north terminal in early 2015.

Phil Kemp, global managing director of Regus Third Place, said: ‘Workpods offer business travellers everything they need when working on the move: a quiet space to check emails, make that last call or concentrate on urgent work before they fly.

‘We know that more and more people need to work on the move, and this is another way of helping our customers maximise their productivity.’

Guy Stephenson, Gatwick’s chief commercial officer, added: ‘Business travel continues to grow at Gatwick, with one in five passengers now travelling on business to a range of destinations, from European business centres to emerging international markets.

‘The Regus workpods will be another key addition to the modern new facilities we offer business passengers every step of the way from the office to the plane.’
