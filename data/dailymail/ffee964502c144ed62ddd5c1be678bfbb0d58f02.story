Scott Brown says he feels fit and ready to complete his first 90 minutes of the season in Salzburg on Thursday night.

The Celtic skipper sustained a damaging hamstring injury against Rapid Vienna in a pre-season friendly in Austria in July.

He now returns to the same country - having made his first-team comeback three weeks ahead of schedule against Aberdeen last Saturday - hoping to reverse a poor run of European results for the champions this season.

An energising force for the Scottish champions as he managed an hour in the 2-1 victory over the Dons at Parkhead, Brown says his hamstring now feels strong and pain free after his muscle tore off the bone.

‘It ripped apart,’ reflected the Scotland midfielder. ‘That’s what happens. I shouldn’t try to stretch at 29.

‘I had done a good warm-up and I can’t blame the temperature, it was 35 degrees. It was just one of those freak accidents that happen, you overstretch and it just snaps.

‘I have to be honest, it was the sorest pain I’ve ever had but in the few days afterwards I felt good, I thought I was going to be back. I just kept pushing myself as far as possible.

‘I thought it was maybe just a wee tweak of the hamstring or something, it was a couple of days later I was walking and feeling fine. It was only when you get the MRI scan, until then you don’t really know what’s going to happen.’

The diagnosis was for a three-month absence. In the event, he returned earlier than anyone anticipated.

Asked if he can last the full game in Salzburg, Brown shrugged: ‘I’ll take it as it goes. I feel good just now and that’s three days after the game.

‘I trained today so everything’s feeling good and I’ll just try to push myself as far as possible and test the boundaries - but my hamstring is feeling as good as it’s ever felt so long may that continue.

‘It was a relief to come through the first training session, let alone the first game. Especially when it was coming to 35, 50 minutes on the clock and I had a look up and I was breathing hard.

‘You think: “Ten minutes still to go here, Scott, try to get a touch of the ball and try to kid on you’re still looking forward to passing.” But it was hard.

‘Everyone’s first game back is always exactly the same, it takes five, 10 minutes to get into the game and then you have to get your second breath and then you can kick on from there.’

Manager Ronny Deila still has his injuries to contend with. Mikael Lustig, Adam Matthews and Charlie Mulgrew remain worries, but with a raft of new signings in the transfer window Brown says there are now no excuses for Celtic in Europe.

‘We are in the Europa League and it’s going to be a hard group as well. Salzburg on Thursday is going to be a really hard game. They’ve just signed someone for £11-£12million so that just shows you what a good squad they have.

‘But I think we have to qualify. That’s what we have to try to do.

‘Salzburg will be a hard game, they have a good squad. We have been watching videos of them.

‘It will be a tough task for us but I think we have to try to go there and get three points and show that we can get the ball down and play football and do really well in the competition. The aim is to try to get out of the group.’

Brown appeared to disagree with suggestions the Europa League is closer to the current level of this Celtic team than the Champions League.

‘Each to their own opinion. I think we are good enough to play in the Champions League, we’ve shown that over the last two or three years when we’ve done really well in it, beat Barcelona and stuff like that. People underestimate us, but each to their own.’
