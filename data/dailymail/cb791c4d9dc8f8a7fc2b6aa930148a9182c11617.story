A four year-old girl ended up needing hospital treatment after she choked on a piece of plastic the size of a two pence piece which was hidden in an ice cream sundae from Burger King.

Liam Bennett, 25, took his family to the fast food restaurant for some lunch in Haydock, Merseyside on Tuesday when daughter Roseanne Chrystall began frantically coughing.

She had been enjoying a chocolate fudge sundae in the back of the family car when Mr Bennett turned round to see her turning blue and frantically clutching her throat.

He leapt out the car and began to squeeze her chest but was unsuccessful and so put his fingers down her throat and pulled out the inch-wide piece of plastic.

He and partner Shona Chrystall, 23, immediately rushed Roseanne to hospital where doctors found her throat was swollen and grazed.

Mr Bennett, a joiner, is demanding answers from Burger King over the shocking incident.

The dad-of-three said: ‘She would have been dead if I wasn’t there.

‘I’m furious with what happened. How does a bit of rubbery plastic like that get into an ice cream in the first place?

‘When I went back in and told them about it they didn’t even look shocked.’

Mr Bennett was on a family day out and he spent around £15 on lunch for his partner and their three children Roseanne, George, two, and Thomas, ten months, before eating it in the car.

He said: ‘My daughter was in the back and I just heard this noise so I turned round to look at her and I could see she was choking.

‘I dragged her out of the car and started squeezing her and hitting her back and I had her upside down at one point, but nothing was working. She was going purple.

‘I turned her over and put my fingers down her throat and pulled out this piece of rubbery plastic. It was about the size of a 2p.

‘It had been lodged in the back of her throat.’

He added: ‘I went into the restaurant and they just said I would have to wait till the manager got back and they would give me a ring.

‘They didn’t seem surprised. They said “that must have happened when so-and-so set it up this morning”.

‘They seemed to think it was part of the ice cream machine.’

The family drove the shaken four-year-old to Wigan Hospital where doctors told the couple she was ‘a very lucky girl’.

‘We were going to have a nice day together but we just had to go home,’ said Mr Bennett.

‘She’s still got a sore throat.’

A spokesman for Burger King said the company was investigating the incident.

He said: ‘Food safety is a top priority at Burger King restaurants.

‘We take this matter very seriously and are currently investigating the incident that allegedly took place at the Haydock Burger King restaurant, which is owned and operated by an independent franchisee.

‘We have not received any additional reports of this nature.’
