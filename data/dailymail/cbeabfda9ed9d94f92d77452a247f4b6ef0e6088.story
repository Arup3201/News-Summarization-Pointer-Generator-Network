It is a common complaint that British politicians do not offer much variety when it comes to making policy.

But it seems the three party leaders have taken their perceived likeness in ideology a little too literally, by arriving at a Buckingham Palace reception wearing what appears to be the same suit.

David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband turned up in nearly identical, navy attires to meet Prince Charles for the beginning of a national campaign urging young people helping others.

It also seemed two of the trio ditched
their traditional party colours when choosing their ties, with the Conservative leader picking purple while Ed Milliband chose a more 
Conservative blue.

Only Nick Clegg stayed fashionably loyal to the Lib Dems with a bland yellow.

The three main party leaders were at the Step Up To Serve launch at the Palace with the Prince of Wales.

They
joined 50 young people to introduce a 
national pledge which is aiming to get 1.7 million more young people aged 10 to 20 to make helping others a habit for life.

The Prime Minister backed the campaign saying: 'I want to see more volunteering, more philanthropy and more of the Big Society - people stepping up and taking part.

'National Citizen Service is a vital part of the campaign the Prince of Wales is launching today.

'It has been a massive success, with more than 40,000 young people getting involved, making a difference and giving something back to their community.'
