MSNBC host Ed Schultz has announced he is leaving his weeknight 8pm slot to move to weekends from next month.

The talkshow host revealed the move to a 5-7pm weekend slot at the end of his show last night, just after his exclusive interview with Scott Prouty, who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's '47 per cent' video during the election campaign.

Schultz, who will present his final 8pm show tonight, told viewers that he had 'a big personal and professional announcement' to make and that the decision to change slots was his.

But the move comes only months after the New York Times reported that network bosses were planning to replace him with Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein. At the time, Schultz described the report as 'media garbage' and he ended up being correct.

On Thursday it was revealed that Schultz will be replaced by Chris Hayes, a 34-year-old presenter who has had his own show on the cable channel's weekend morning schedule since September 2011 called 'Up with Chris Hayes'.

Haeys confirmed the report by tweeting:

Last night, Schultz, who has presented the Ed Show in various slots since 2009, told viewers: 'I want you to know that I raised my hand for this assignment for a number of personal and professional reasons.

Exclusive: The big announcement about the time swap came after Schultz interviewed Scott Prouty who filmed the infamous 47 percent video of Mitt Romney

Confirmed: Chris Hayes tweeted about the switch on Thursday

'My fight on The Ed Show has been for the workers and the middle class in this country.

'This new time slot will give me the opportunity to produce and focus on stories that I care about and are important to American families and American workers.'

Schultz, who was the second most-watched host on the network at the time of the last ratings, said he would have more time to report from around the country.

'Sitting behind this desk five nights a week just doesn't cut it for me,' he said.

'I want to get out with the people, like I did in Wisconsin.

'I want to get out and tell their stories all over the country.

'This show has been a voice for the voiceless. That really was my mission when I came here and it remains.'

The host said he planned to stay with MSNBC for a long time and vowed to carry on with his radio show 'until the good lord takes me'.

As Schultz handed over to 9pm host Rachel Maddow, she told him: 'Knowing that you're going to be putting the flag on the weekends in the way that you are makes me really happy for NBC that we've got you for the long haul.'

The move comes just months after Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein was tipped to be taking over the 8pm slot, which Schultz dismissed at the time as 'media garbage'

MSNBC president Phil Griffin said he was 'thrilled for Ed and happy to be expanding our weekend programming.'

'It’s an exciting time for MSNBC, and I’m looking forward to having Ed’s powerful voice on our network for a long time.'

Schultz is a long-established political commentator, who shifted his views from far right to left of center in the late Nineties.

He became a Democrat in 2000 and
his views are now described as 'pro-union,' a large portion of his 
radio show is devoted to the 'plight of working Americans.'

Schultz
was moved to the 8pm Eastern slot in 
October 2011 after stints broadcasting at 10pm and 6pm since joining MSNBC in 2009.

Prior to that move, Schultz had been suspended for a week 
for calling conservative commentator Laura Ingraham a 'right-wing slut' 
and a 'talk slut.'

In 2010, he threatened to 'torch' the MSNBC building after he felt he wasn’t getting enough promotion.

MSNBC
has undergone a highly successful metamorphosis in recent years, which 
have seen it emerge as the nation’s liberal TV network of choice, its ratings overtaking CNN.
