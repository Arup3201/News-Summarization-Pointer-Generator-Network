Judge Nicolas Cooke QC, pictured, allowed James Parker's court application to attend a gig in Ibiza as he too had 'been behind the wheels of steel himself'

An Old Bailey judge allowed a DJ allegedly involved in a £750,000 fraud to fly to Ibiza for a gig.

DJ James Parker, 41, is accused along with three other men of submitting a string of false invoices to Marsh Ltd in a two-and-a-half year swindle. He denies committing fraud by false representation.

Parker, who specialises in 'house' music, applied for permission to fly to the Spanish party isle later this month to perform alongside DJs Tall Paul and Judge Jules.

Judge Nicholas Cooke QC allowed the bid in court - confessing he had ‘been behind the wheels of steel’ himself.

When Judge Cooke revealed his musical past, Matthew Lawson - Parker's defence - joked: 'I will have to Google it.'

Judge Cooke, who took silk in 1998, was handed a flyer for Parker’s upcoming 
gig at the Es Paradis for a return of legendary club night Clockwork 
Orange - 20 years after it first began.

After doing so, Mr Lawson told the court: ‘He works as a DJ and continues to do so - the flyer is from one of the Ibiza clubs and has his name on it.’

An initially skeptical judge commented: ‘In my experience, the fact a DJ’s name appears on the flyers does not mean as huge amount.’

However, he was then convinced to allow the bid after hearing Parker’s bail had already been varied twice before.

Parker, who is subject to bail conditions to stay at his home in West Norwood, southeast London and not to contact his co-defendants, will be allowed to fly to Ibiza from July 24 to 29 to play the gig.

Parker, Ricky Merry, 45, Paul Seaman, 57, and Jason Senior, 48, are jointly accused of submitting a string of false invoices to insurance brokers Marsh Ltd to obtain £713,628.73 between November 4, 2008 and March 29, 2011.

Merry, of Wapping, east London, Parker, of West 
Norwood, southeast London, Seaman, of Erith, Kent, and 
Senior, of Heighington, Lincoln, all deny conspiracy 
to commit fraud by false representation.

Merry is listed online as an IT consultant at Reds Consulting Ltd, while Seaman is an engineer with IT firm Matrix Communications.

Judge Cooke adjourned the case for a three-week trial to start on January 5 next year.

All four men were freed on bail until the start of their trial.

Judge Cooke lists ‘music of Black America 1959-1973’ among his hobbies, alongside 
athletics, theatre, hockey and supporting Newport County AFC.
