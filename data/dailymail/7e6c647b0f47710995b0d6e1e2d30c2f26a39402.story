A mother and daughter have given birth at the same hospital on the same day.

Heather Penticoff, 40, and her 20-year-old daughter Destinee Martin each discovered they were pregnant the same afternoon earlier this year.  

They had the same due dates and, for separate medical reasons, doctors at Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, decided to induce both of them on Tuesday.

Penticoff's daughter Madeline was born first.

Within three hours later, Destinee's son Damien was born, making Penticoff's grandson roughly the same age as her newborn daughter.

Penticoff told WZVN-TV that the births are 'like having twins without carrying twins.'

Happy families: Destinee said she is so happy to be going through parenthood at the same time as her mom

'It's a blessing all around. I'm just proud of her, so proud of Destinee,' she added. 

Tearful, clutching her newborn, Martin said experiencing pregnancy and birth with her mother 'is probably the most special, amazing thing ever.' 

It is not the first time this has happened in their family: Destinee's grandparents had another three children after she was born.
