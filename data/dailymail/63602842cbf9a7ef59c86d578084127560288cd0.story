The father of a Massachusetts teen suspended after posting a photo of herself and her boyfriend in homecoming attire holding Airsoft rifles says the situation was 'blown out of proportion' by the school.

Speaking for his daughter Jamie and her boyfriend Tito Velez, both 16, Jailes Pereira explained Wednesday that he understood the school's reasoning, but said the photo was an 'innocent mistake.'

'It was a totally innocent, stupid mistake that Tito made by putting the word ‘homecoming’ at the bottom of the photo and then posting it to Facebook,' Pereira told Fox News.

Homecoming: Tito uploaded a photo to Facebook of himself and his girlfriend Jamie, both 16, holding Airsoft rifles and captioned it 'Homecoming 2014,' drawing ire from his school

Tito uploaded a photo Friday night of him and his girlfriend in formal wear holding Airsoft rifles, captioning it 'Homecoming 2014.' He said the couple wanted to 'do something unique and different' for their pre-homecoming photos.

On Monday, classmates at Bristol-Plymouth Regional Technical School were talking about the photo, creating what Superintendent Richard Gross called a 'tumult.'

'These students know what is provocative,' Dr Richard Gross told CBS. 'To tie that to one of our school events kind of puts it over the top which brings us into it.'

The photo coincided with a school shooting in Washington on Friday, when student gunman Jaylen Fryberg shot five friends, killing two, before turning the gun on himself. 

'This isn’t dangerous, you can’t kill someone with it,' said Tito about the replica guns. 'We didn’t shoot anyone; we were pointing them at the floor.'

Airsoft guns are nonlethal, though many are crafted to resemble actual firearms like an AR-15, and fire pellets made of plastic, rubber and other materials.

Harmless: Tito said that the guns are not dangerous and noted he was pointing the gun at the floor in the photo he posted

Tito says he often competes on a team playing Airsoft, similar to a paintball competition.

Pereira says he's meeting with Principal Carolyn Pearson about how Jamie will be punished. So far, the school has not decided on the the length of the teens' suspension. 

'A slap on the wrist, maybe a day-long suspension or a warning would’ve been the right thing,' said Pereira. 'They’re great kids, they follow all the rules.'
