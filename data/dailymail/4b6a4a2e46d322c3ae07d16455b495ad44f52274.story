Tragic: Anne Jackson, 79, was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck

A renowned poet was allegedly stabbed to death by her stepson at her picturesque country farm in south Wales, an inquest heard today.

Writer Anne Jackson, 79, was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck and her stepson Timothy Jackson, 48, has been arrested and charged with her murder.

Mrs Jackson, who used the name Anne Cluysenaar to write, also worked as a teacher and university lecturer.

She was killed on November 1 - just one day after celebrating her 39th wedding anniversary with her husband Walt.

Coroner's officer David Arnold told the inquest: 'On arrival officers located the body of a female in the living room area of the property.

'Life was pronounced extinct at the scene by paramedics. A post mortem examination found the cause of death to be stab wounds to the chest and neck.'

Belgium-born Mrs Jackson came to Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two.

She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old - and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life.

She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen.

The poet had moved to a small-holding with her husband Walt and had lived there for more than 25 years.

Mr Jackson, who did not live with the couple, appeared in court earlier this month charged with murder.

Gwent Coroner David Bowen adjourned the Newport inquest after releasing her body for a funeral to take place.

Mrs Jackson had seen much of her work printed in literary journals and magazines and her publisher Cinammon Press said she was a highly committed poet.

Dr Jan Fortune, from the firm, told the BBC that Mrs Jackson and her husband Walt had celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary the day before she died.

She said Mrs Jackson was very supportive of other people's work and would always put herself out to help them.

She added: 'It is a great loss to poetry and also a great loss in terms of the way the community of poets operate. She was a generous and extraordinarily talented poet.'

She added that the company was still committed to publishing Mrs Jackson's most recent work.
