NBC has pulled the plug on its planned comedy project with Bill Cosby following claims by multiple women that he drugged and raped them.

'We can confirm that the Cosby project is no longer in development,' the network said in a statement released on Wednesday afternoon. 

The announcement came just hours after Netflix said it has postponed its new stand-up comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving.

Appearances by Cosby on shows including Late Night With David Letterman and The Queen Latifah Show have also been cancelled as accusations against the comedian mount.

Accused: Bill Cosby, pictured in September, has been accused of rape by multiple women - leading NBC to cancel a proposed comedy series starring the actor

On Wednesday, sources told Variety that writers and producers working on NBC's still-untitled comedy project with the star were told on Wednesday that it is no longer going forward. 

The network had set a deal for the show with Cosby last summer and it was set to star him in another family setting, similar to his role in The Cosby Show.

Sony Pictures TV was going to develop the script with writers Mike O'Malley and Mike Sikowitz, although a finished script was never handed over to NBC, according to Variety.

The cancellation came after yet more women stepped forward to claim he had sexually assaulted them, often after providing them with alcohol. 

Removed: TV Land has decided "The Cosby Show" isn't worth the risk, so it's quietly killing the show's presence on it's website

Now the cable network TV Land has also decided any association with the funnyman isn't worth the risk.

The company is quietly killing his show's presence on it's website.

On Wednesday deactivated all of the "Cosby" links. Previously, users were able to watch video clips of his show and get information about air dates.

Those same links now direct users to an error page.

Meanwhile, his comedy concert series appears to still be going ahead. 

TMZ  is reporting that staff at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas had a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether or not to pull Thursday's show, which is almost sold out.

He is also due to perform in Melbourne, Florida on Friday to another packed house. Again, the show is on and nobody has asked for a refund.

Next Friday he is scheduled to perform in Las Vegas. There are still seats available and the show has not been cancelled and it is likely to remain that way until any formal charges are filed.

ANDREA CONSTAND

In 2005 the former director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University went to authorities to reveal she was sexually molested by Cosby. Without enough evidence to indict him, Constand launched a civil suit but settled out of court. At the time, 13 other women said they would testify about assaults they had suffered at the hands of Cosby but due to the settlement, they did not appear in court.

BARBARA BOWMAN

In October she told MailOnline that in the mid-1980's, when she was an aspiring actress living in Colorado, she was introduced to the comic who would help launch her career. She says she was 'drugged, raped an emotionally abused' by the man who had become a father figure to her.

JOAN TARSHIS

On two occasions in Hollywood in 1969 the music publicist says Cosby gave her 'strong drinks that caused her to black out and when she awoke she was naked and he then attacked her'.

LINDA JOY TRAITZ

Traitz of Hallandale Beach, Florida, claims she was just 19 when the actor drove her out to a beach in Los Angeles and tried to get her to relax by taking drugs

JANICE DICKINSON

Last night supermodel Janice Dickinson told Entertainment Tonight that Bill Cosby lured her to his home with a TV offer and then drugged and raped her in 1982. 'The last thing I remember is him taking off his robe and climbing on top of me':

TAMARA GREEN

Green told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her.

On Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, former model Janice Dickinson, now 59, said that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982. 

Dickinson said it happened after a dinner they shared in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she said she had gone to talk about a job offer from Cosby.

At the dinner she said she had red wine and a pill Cosby gave her because she had menstrual and stomach pains.

'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' Dickinson told ET.

She said she woke up with semen between her legs.

She added that she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do'.

As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words.

'How dare you,' she said. 'Go f*** yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.'

It came after former actress Barbara Bowman revealed her alleged abuse to MailOnline, explaining that in 1985, at age 17, Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times'.

Then on Sunday, Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, said she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when Cosby drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions.

Linda Joy Traitz then stepped forward to claim Cosby attacked her when she was 19.

Then on Wednesday, another woman, retired lawyer Tamara Green, claimed Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her in the 1970s.

She was an aspiring actress at the time and Cosby promised to help her secure roles.

Cosby has denied the allegations. 

He has never been criminally charged in any case, but in November 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier.

Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify.

Following the accusations, on Tuesday, Netflix said it would not be airing its show as planned.

'At this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand-up comedy special Bill Cosby 77,' the video streaming service said in a statement.

The show was going to be a birthday celebration for Cosby, in which he would share stories from his childhood, first romantic relationships and parenthood, according to reports.
