The Los Angeles Police Department is launching an internal investigation into the arrest of a Django Unchained actress who claims she was stopped by cops who thought she was a prostitute.

Daniele Watts' boyfriend Brian Lucas filmed her crying as she was handcuffed and questioned by police for simply kissing her partner in public.

Police also questioned Lucas and asked him questions like 'Do you really know her?' - seemingly insinuating that Watts was soliciting.

The couple described the humiliating incident to Buzzfeed, saying they were kissing in Lucas' car outside the CBS Studio Center in Studio City on Thursday when someone in a nearby office walked by and told them to stop. 

'A Caucasian guy in a business suit comes downstairs and says, 'Can you guys stop putting on a show? I have people who are trying to work up there,'" Watts told ABC 7.

The Los Angeles Police Department has long been accused of using racial profiling in their arrests  

A 2008 study conducted by Yale economist Professor Ian Ayres found that blacks are three times more likely to be stopped in L.A. than whites.

The study also found that of 1,200 complaints of racial profiling over a five-year period, none of the officers were actually found guilty of the charge and disciplined.

And this isn't the only time in recent weeks that the LAPD has been accused of racial profiling.

Last month, a black film and television producer was arrested on his way to an Emmy party and held for six hours by police who thought he was a robbery suspect.

The producer, 51-year-old Charles Belk, was later released when officers realized he had nothing to do with the crime.

Last year, the LAPD launched a program to address these complaints, bringing officers and the citizens who accuse them of profiling together for mediated talks.

Officers who participated in the so-called 'Community-employee education pilot program' are rewarded by having the internal investigation into the incident dropped.

Watts says she was fully dressed and only kissing when police were called to the scene, and asked for the couple's identification.

Lucas handed police his ID, but Watts refused and started walking away from the scene.

'I didn't have the stomach for someone on a power trip when I knew I hadn't done anything wrong,' Watts told Buzzfeed.

That's when police stopped and handcuffed her, bringing her back to the scene where the couple was questioned. Lucas found the kinds of questions troubling. 

'How do you know her, what relationship, they were questions that quite frankly made me feel like that they were questioning me being like the client of a prostitute,' Lucas said. 'He didn't say anything ever about that, I just felt that energy from it.'

Watts was eventually let go after providing photo ID. 

While the LAPD initially refused to comment on the incident, since there had been no official arrest, they have since released a statement saying they are investigating. 

They said two officers were dispatched to the scene on a report of 'indecent exposure' and briefly detained the two individuals. 

'Upon further investigation it was determined that no crime had been committed. Ms. Watts and her companion were subsequently released,' police said. 

News of the arrest spread after the couple wrote about it on their social media accounts.  

Watts wrote on her Facebook page: 'Today I was handcuffed and detained by 2 police officers from the Studio City Police Department after refusing to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.'

She also posted a photo of crying as she stood in the street wearing patterned shorts, a t-shirt with 'New York' written on it and running shoes with a  policeman next to her.

Watts, who plays Martin Lawrence's daughter on the new FX comedy Partners, continued: 'When the officer arrived, I was standing on the sidewalk by a tree.

The pair both wrote about the alleged incident on their respective Facebook pages 

Happy: The couple pictured above in a photo posted to Watts' Facebook 

'I was talking to my father on my cell phone.

'I knew that I had done nothing wrong, that I wasn't harming anyone, so I walked away.

'A few minutes later, I was still talking to my dad when 2 different police officers accosted me and forced me into handcuffs.

'As I was sitting in the back of the police car, I remembered the countless times my father came home frustrated or humiliated by the cops when he had done nothing wrong. 

'I allowed myself to be honest about my anger, frustration, and rage as tears flowed from my eyes.

'The tears I cry for a country that calls itself 'the land of the free and the home of the brave' and yet detains people for claiming that very right. 

Separately her chef boyfriend posted on his Facebook page that he thought that the person who called the police had decided they looked like a prostitute and a client.

He wrote: 'From the questions that he asked me as D was already on her phone with her dad, I could tell that whoever called on us (including the officers), saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a H* (prostitute) & a TRICK (client). 

'What an assumption to make!!!Because of my past experience with the law, I gave him my ID knowing we did nothing wrong and when they asked D for hers, she refused to give it because they had no right to do so.

'So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was. In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly NOT COOL!!!'
