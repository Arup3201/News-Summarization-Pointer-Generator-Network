Chasing a lorry down the motorway and pulling open the back doors to clamber inside, this was the scene in Calais today as yet more immigrants make frantic attempts to get into the UK.

French authorities say they have been forced to send an extra 100 police to the port city as an estimated 2,500 migrants sleep rough in camps in the hope of crossing the channel.

The frightened people, mostly from Africa and Asia, have been drawn to Calais in the hope of reaching 'El Dorado' Britain, thanks to generous state handouts, according to the town's mayor.

Desperation: A group of migrants rip open the back doors of a lorry in Calais today as they try to find a way to cross from France into Britain in search of a better life

Wave of humanity: There are thought to be around 2,500 people currently camping in the French port city, as authorities send another 100 officers to deal with the crisis

Dying for a better life: Yesterday the mayor of Calais warned that migrants were willing to die in order to get to Britain, and blamed generous government handouts for drawing them in

Natacha Bouchart yesterday told the Commons home affairs select committee that the UK's welfare system is to blame for the crisis, which has seen record numbers of migrants arrive this year.

The offer of £35 per week for those arriving on these shores is prompting people to risk their lives to cross the channel.

She said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain.

‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives.

‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week.

Fleeing: The men are mostly African or Asian and are fleeing humanitarian problems back home, including war, famine and persecution

Lost: Yesterday it was revealed that the British government has lost track of 50,000 illegal migrant, while it has failed to deport another 175,000

Under attack: Just last month a P&O ferry crew were forced to use a fire hose on 250 immigrants as they tried to rush on board the boat (pictured, a migrant tried to break into a lorry in Calais today)

'People who have got through call and say,… "this is El Dorado and we’re staying here".’

Once here, there is also the chance that they could become one of the 50,000 illegal immigrants that the Public Accounts Committee admits it has lost track of.

It was revealed today that ministers have failed to kick out another 175,000 immigrants, at a time when applications to enter the country have grown by an alarming 70 per cent in a year.

It is perhaps no surprise, then, to find thousands of desperate people living in squalid camps in France, and leaping into lorries in an attempt to come here.

These images show groups of ten or more forcing open the back of lorries destined for Dover before virtually tripping over each-other in order to pile in.

Setting up camp: The French government has announced plans for a shelter for the migrants who are currently sleeping in tents, saying that the conditions have lead to infighting

No other choice: While many fear that the new shelter will simply attract more desperate people, France says it is the UK benefits system that has drawn so many in the first place

The issue of immigration has shot up the political agenda in Britain ever since Douglas Carswell become the first UKIP MP after winning a by-election in Clacton by a huge margin.

A ComRes survey revealed last week that Mark Reckless  is on course to become Nigel Farage's second MP in a by-election in Rochester next month, as voters punish both the Tories and Labour over immigration and the EU.

Ed MIliband and David Cameron exchanged blows over the issue during Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament today, with Miliband attacking the Prime Minister - saying his government had missed key migration targets.

Natacha Bouchart says Britain must own up to its part in causing the current crisis in Calais, and called on David Cameron to prove that the UK is not an 'El Dorado' for migrants

Cameron hit back, saying he would compared his record to Labour's 'any time', suggesting that the last government had created the mess he was trying to fix.

Only last month staff on a P&O ferry were forced to use a fire hose on around 250 Eritrean men after they scaled barriers around the port and tried to storm on to the boat.

The lorry driver who filmed the scene described the city as being like a 'war zone', saying the problem was the worst he had seen it in 20 years.
