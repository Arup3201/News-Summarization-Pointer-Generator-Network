UKIP leader Nigel Farage has made a dramatic offer to form an election pact with the Tories – but only if they dump David Cameron as leader.

Buoyed by big gains in Thursday’s town hall elections, Farage last night said he is ready to join forces with the Conservatives to keep Ed Miliband out of power.

Senior Tory sources flatly dismissed Farage’s call for Cameron to step down, but significantly did not rule out talks with UKIP on how they might work together. In his first major interview since winning 147 council seats, Mr Farage told The Mail on Sunday:

Farage said that if David Cameron were to quit he would join the Tories at the next election

UKIP and Tory candidates could run a single candidate in key parliamentary seats, in effect a Tory/UKIP coalition.

He plans to take Parliament by storm by standing in a by-election expected in Portsmouth soon.

He had given Mr Cameron a ‘kick in the balls’ in the local elections.

‘Foolish’ Tory Cabinet Minister Ken Clarke had driven voters to UKIP by branding the party ‘clowns’.

Mr Farage’s success has shaken all three main party leaders, and Education Secretary Michael Gove has failed to kill off fresh reports of a bid to topple Mr Cameron by dismissing any such plot as ‘bonkerooney’. 

The rumours were refuelled by  rebel Tory MP Adam Afriyie who told the Prime Minister last night to ‘stop pussyfooting around’ and ‘get a grip on immigration’.

Tremors from the UKIP earthquake 
prompted similar jibes against Ed Miliband from dissident Labour MPs. 
And Lib Dem MPs said it was ‘by no means impossible’ that Vince Cable 
would replace struggling Nick Clegg before the next Election.

Mr Farage’s offer to discuss a General Election deal with the Tories is another sign of the rapidly changing political landscape in Britain. 

He says it could win the Tories an extra 50 seats – enough for them to stay in power. Crucially, it would give UKIP a say in running the country for the first time.

But Mr Farage says the Conservatives would have to agree to two demands: Sack Cameron, with a clear pledge by his successor to hold a prompt In/Out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

He has seized on quirks in election law which would allow UKIP and Tory candidates to wear the rosettes of both parties. At a stroke, UKIP votes in key areas would help the Tories keep Labour out of power – and bring Farage’s dream of leading Britain out of the EU closer.

Until now, the UKIP leader has ruled out any deals with the Conservatives, partly because Mr Cameron called UKIP ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’.

But Mr Farage’s surge in popularity, together with a slump in Mr Cameron’s, has prompted a rethink. He is now ready to do business with the Tories if Mr Cameron is replaced with a more eurosceptic Tory leader, such as Boris Johnson or Mr Gove.

Mr Farage said: ‘There are lots of intelligent ways of doing deals in the future, all sorts of things a sensible, patriotic Conservative leader, could pursue. ‘I have been approached by Conservative Associations who say “look Nigel, not only have you taken a lump of our vote but you’ve also picked up the council estate vote round the corner which is never going to come to us. If we ran a candidate on a joint ticket we would walk it.” ’

Alternatively, the two parties could have a more straightforward non-aggression pact and agree not to run against each other in certain seats, says Farage. 

He denies claims it is fantasy politics. ‘Not at all. I have sat round the table on Sunday evenings with Conservative Party officials who have suggested this kind of thing to me.’

Farage has everything to gain from any such deal. UKIP’s success on Thursday may not translate into a single Commons seat in the 2105 General Election. ‘I’d rather have half an MP than not one at all,’ he says bluntly.

Ken Clarke branded the party 'clowns' potentially driving voters to UKIP

He says the Tories could win ‘up to 50 extra seats’ by teaming up with UKIP, but it would carry huge risks. It could split the Party, with eurosceptic MPs grabbing the offer, while others may quit the Party rather than be associated with the reactionary views of UKIP. They would oppose  giving Mr Farage the whip hand and relying on him for a Parliamentary majority.

Mr Farage maintains the likelihood of the Tories dumping Cameron before the election is not far-fetched. ‘I wouldn’t be so sure.’

A senior Conservative with close links to Mr Cameron said he would not resign, but did not close the door to talks. ‘If UKIP wants to put proposals to us, let them go ahead,’ he said.
