Mother nature has done her best to create some of the most spectacular scenes on Sydney's Northern beaches.

Captured by a photographer, eight metre swells produced some massive waves during the week, sending whitewater sprouting metres into the air.

A couple of the brilliant nature shots see a lone surfer dwarfed by the whitewash, showing just how high the waves disperse, almost a similar look to a cloud in the sky.

Incredible images of a photographer standing near the huge waves, also depict how the Northern Beaches are pounded by the ferocious ocean.

And while Sydney Harbour isn't the first place you'd go to ride waves, surfers took advantage of the large swells which made its way, all the way inside the Harbour.

Surfers are seen riding 'novelty waves', which is quite an unusual sight.

But for the Manly Ferry, the dramatic conditions at Sydney's Northern beaches proved difficult. The eight metre swells battered the vessels as they tried to make their way across.

Senior forecaster Jake Phillips from the Bureau of Meteorology says the large swells weren't just confined to Sydney but were right across the NSW coast.

'A deep low pressure system over the Tasman sea a few days ago was slow moving,' he said.

'Over long periods of time, winds started to whip up seas and turn into swells, due to a low pressure system consistently driving southerly winds over the coast.'

Mr Phillips said NSW and Sydney experienced some very windy conditions throughout the week, with a severe weather warning along the coast.

Sydney wave statistics for the week from the BOM. Senior forecaster Jake Phillips said winds started to whip up seas and turn into swells across NSW, due to a low pressure system consistently driving southerly winds over the coast.

Senior forecaster Jake Phillips from the Bureau of Meteorology says the large swells weren't just confined to Sydney but were right across the NSW coast due to a deep low pressure system

'Lucky the swells were coming from the south, if that swell came more from the east, there would have been a greater impact in terms of coastal erosion.'

He believes the swells peaked on the Wednesday which produced some of the highest waves, up to eight metres along the coast.

But the question is, are we likely to see those winds and large swells continue?  Apparently not with nothing on the horizon according to Mr Phillips.

'Now we are on a gradual decreasing trend, the swells are moving over to New Zealand, the winds are easing and a high pressure system is coming across, bringing lighter winds,' he said.

As for the weather forecast, it is still looking wet until about Thursday where the sun will hopefully come out to show us what spring looks like.

Rain chart for NSW on September 6 shows scattered showers. The forecast for next week will continue to see showers and partly cloudy conditions but are expected to ease with some sunny weather forecast for Thursday

Scattered showers and partly cloudy conditions are being forecast for the start of the week but are expected to ease up with Thursday and Friday showing signs of sunny weather.

'Spring is traditionally a time that offers a bit of variety,' said Mr Phillips.

'The general trend for three months suggest southern and western parts of the state will receive a little less than the average rainfall while in the north indicators are looking average for rainfall.'

Temperature wise, he says it should be slightly higher than the average in the south and west and in the north around average.

'Sydney will be slightly warmer and drier for the next three months.'

'Winter was interesting, June and July were well above the average temperature and dry and August was very wet, one of the wettest August since 1998 in Sydney.'

'A cold front will sweep through the middle of next week, with Sydney definitely looking to warm up into Monday and Tuesday.'
