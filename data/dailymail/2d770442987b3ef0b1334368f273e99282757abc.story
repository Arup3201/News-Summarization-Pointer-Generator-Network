A 55-year-old investment banker from Manhattan who was the sole American fighting for the Ukraine in the eastern European war has been killed in combat.

Mark Gregory Paslawky, who was born and raised in New York, joined the war against the separatist Russia-backed rebellion - which has already claimed over 2,000 lives and displaced over 300,000 - because of his Ukrainian lineage.

However according to Vice magazine, he died on Tuesday from gunshot wounds sustained in a battle in the city of Ilovaysk.

'He had three wounds in his back,' Ukrainian photographer Maxim Dondyuk told the magazine.

Deciated: Mark Paslawky said in an interview earlier this month that he is not married and does not have children, otherwise he wouldn't have chosen to fight in the Ukraine

'He was saying that he was in pain and that he didn’t want to die.

'People were telling him he was going to be OK.

'I think it might have been possible to save him if we had medevac helicopters or ambulances, but all there was on hand were the battalion medics.'

Paslawky told Vice in August that his decision to join the war came from watching news reports of the worsening situation in Ukraine after Moscow's annexation of Crimea.

'Given what I saw, the level of incompetence, the corruption, the lack of activity — I just decided that I needed to go and participate,' he told Vice.

'If there was ever a time to help Ukraine this was the time to do it.'

A long-time former Army Ranger, Paslawsky worked in the financial sector and was based out of Kiev, Kharkiv, and Moscow for many years.

Friends say they believed him to be quite wealthy, but was not one to 'use his money'.

War:  In the last week several neighborhoods in the Pro-Russian rebel-held city of Donetsk have been bombarded with sustained artillery fire from Ukrainian troops as fighting on the city's outskirts has become more intense

Street battles were raging in Ilovaysk, a key railway hub some 45 kilometres (30 miles) east of Donetsk, with authorities saying nine soldiers died in the area in the last 24 hours, including a US national who fought for a Ukrainian volunteer battalion

Paslawsky told Vice he did not have a wife or children.

'No. I'm not crazy like that, I wouldn't be here if I did,' he said.

Ukrainian forces have battled separatist rebels to capture the town of Ilovaysk for the last three days, according to Vice.

They are trying to cut the rebels off from their own capital, Donetsk, to keep them from the Russian border and supplies.
