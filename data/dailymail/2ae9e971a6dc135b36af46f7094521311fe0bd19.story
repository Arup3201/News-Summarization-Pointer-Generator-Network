Sugary drinks should be labelled with health warnings to make them as socially unacceptable as cigarettes because of their contribution to Britain’s obesity epidemic, says a leading public health doctor.

Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool caused controversy earlier this year by declaring ‘sugar is the new tobacco’ and claiming the food industry was focused on ‘profit not health’.

Now he is calling on the Government to follow the example of California which is considering placing warning labels on all sweetened drinks about the links to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.

Professor Simon Capewell warns the Government's current policies are doing nothing to quash obesity

He said current policies are failing to reverse the obesity epidemic in which sugar is ‘increasingly implicated as a specific causal factor’.

And he highlighted a recent European study showing adults who drank more than one can of sugary fizzy drinks a day had a 22 per cent higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than those who drank less than a can a month.  

In a personal view published on bmj.com (must credit as stated), Prof Capewell said a third of children and two-thirds of adults are now overweight or obese in the UK.

Halving US and UK children’s sugar-sweetened beverage consumption could mean a 50 to 100 kcal reduction in energy intake a day, perhaps arresting or even reversing the current increases in obesity, he said.

He said surveys showed 60 per cent of Britons would support warnings on food packaging, which may herald a ‘tipping point in public attitudes and political feasibilities.’

The Government’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies warned in March that the Government may soon have to slap a sugar tax on junk food and fizzy drinks to tackle obesity.

Professor Capewell is part of a new US-UK campaign group - Action on Sugar - that says asking firms to make voluntary changes has failed.

He caused controversy in January by declaring: ‘Sugar is the new tobacco’.

The typical Briton consumes 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and some adults consume as many as 46.

The maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation is ten, although this guideline is likely to be halved.

Health officials in California are considering warning labels for soft drinks like those on cigarette packets

Prof Capewell sugar was being ‘progressively demonised’.

‘Many other potentially harmful products already carry effective health warnings. For example, insecticides and other toxic products have long carried labels warning users to take extreme care’ he said.

‘Similarly, cigarettes have gone from being socially acceptable to quite unacceptable after warning labels were implemented.

‘The effectiveness of tobacco warnings and plain packaging is now accepted by almost everyone not linked to the industry’ he said.

Prof Capewell said warning labels represented an ‘interesting natural experiment’ that ‘may offer an effective new strategy to complement existing, potentially powerful interventions like marketing bans and sugary drinks duties’.

Prof Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow, said there was mounting evidence for sugary drinks contributing to excess energy intake, obesity and, in turn, higher diabetes risks.  

‘Furthermore, as Prof Capewell points out, public support for an obesity warning on these drinks appears strong’ he added.

Dr Nita Forouhi, MRC Programme Leader and Public Health Physician at MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, said ‘Big problems need bold solutions.

If the California Bill, currently being considered for health warning labels on sugary drinks, goes ahead, it will set an important precedent.

‘There is a consistent body of evidence for the adverse health effects of sugary drinks.’

However, Professor Tom Sanders, Head of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division, School of Medicine, King’s College London, said ‘Excessive intake of sugary drinks contributes to unhealthy weight gain in children.

‘But sugar is not like tobacco: it is not addictive and does not cause cardiovascular disease and cancer.

‘Oral rehydration solutions, which contain sugar, have prevented millions of deaths.

‘The risks to young people’s health presented by smoking, alcohol, drugs, unsafe sex, tattooing and body piercing are far greater – a warning label on soft drinks suggests a lack of perspective.’

California is considering a law that would require all cans and bottles of sugary beverages to have this warning label: 'Drinking beverages with added sugars contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.'

It could be voted on by the state senate next week.
