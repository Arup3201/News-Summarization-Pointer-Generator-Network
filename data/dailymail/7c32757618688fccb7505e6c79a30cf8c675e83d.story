Stoke City have completed a double swoop to sign Mame Biram Diouf and Dionatan Teixeira.

Hannover striker Diouf, who made just five appearances during a three-year spell with Manchester United and also spent time on loan at Blackburn, will join the Potters when his current contract ends on July 1 and has signed a four-year deal with the club.

Meanwhile, 21-year-old Brazilian defender Teixeira arrives at the Britannia Stadium from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica for an undisclosed fee.

Manager Mark Hughes has been busy this week in a bid to improve on Stoke's ninth place finish last season.

The
 arrivals of Diouf and Teixeira take the number of new Stoke signings up
 to four as they join Steve Sidwell, who joins from Fulham following the
 club's relegation, and former Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley.

Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said: 'It's no secret that Mame is someone we have been looking to bring to the Club for some time.

'Mark Hughes has wanted to sign Mame since he took over as manager last year. We tried to get him last summer and made another attempt in January, so we're naturally delighted to have finally secured his services.

'He has been a tremendous success in Germany as his record underlines and he is keen to return to England make an impact in the Premier League. We're pleased to be able to give him the platform to hopefully achieve that ambition.

Brazilian-born Teixeira is a current member of the Slovak Under-21 squad and has signed a three-year deal with Stoke.

Speaking of the commanding 6'4" defender, Scholes said: 'We have been following Dionatan's progress for some time and we're delighted to have secured his services because there's no doubt he's a talented player with a great deal of potential.'
