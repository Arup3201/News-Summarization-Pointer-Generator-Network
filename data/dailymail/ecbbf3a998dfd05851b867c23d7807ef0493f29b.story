Up-and-coming trainer Hugo Palmer is considering an ambitious tilt at the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf in California with Aktabantay.

After the colt had scrambled home by a short-head under jockey Ryan Moore to land Saturday’s Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown, Newmarket-based Palmer — who is in his fourth season training — revealed that taking the son of Oasis Dream to Santa Anita at the end of October is a serious option.

Palmer, 33, said: ‘It is something we will discuss over the next few weeks. He is also in the Dewhurst Stakes. He is lovely horse for next year.

‘We would get quick ground and a fast pace in the Breeders’ Cup — they go flat to the boards — and he will be suited by that. He is a very exciting horse.’

Having won valuable handicaps at both Glorious Goodwood and York’s Ebor meeting this summer, the Solario win of Aktabantay was a first at group level for Palmer, a scion of the biscuit-making family.

Up-and-coming: Palmer, 33, is only in his fourth season as a trainer but will be pleased after recent successes

The colt’s Turkish owner Ibrahim Araci had previously won the Solario in 2010 with Ed Dunlop’s Native Khan, a colt which went on to finish third to Frankel in the 2,000 Guineas.

Palmer had fitted 370,000-guinea purchase Aktabantay with cheekpieces to help him concentrate after the colt had finished third twice in three of his first four races.
