A former Sky TV researcher has died after breaking her neck in a car crash on a Caribbean island despite being flown back to Britain for emergency treatment.

Kate Clayton, from Southampton, suffered devastating injuries when her car swerved off a country road in the Cayman Islands, where she was living and working as a diving instructor. 

Thanks to strangers who donated £6,000 in just four days, the 30-year-old's family managed to fly her back to the UK for treatment. 

Kate Clayton, 30, died in Southampton General Hospital after sustaining serious injuries in a car crash on the Cayman Islands

But despite this, Ms Clayton died in the intensive care unit on February 18 - just a week after she arrived at Southampton General Hospital.

In a message posted on the Help Kate Get Home appeal website, her family said: 'Kate passed away at The Neurological ICU in Southampton General Hospital.

Ms Clayton moved to Grand Cayman in December 2013 after leaving her job as an analyst at Sky

'Jo (mum) and Neil (uncle) were at her bedside. Family members and friends had a chance to say their 'final goodbyes'.

'As a family, we would like to thank all the Staff at the Neurological ICU for the compassion and care they showed Kate and our family during the traumatic time. 

'The time our family spent on the unit was obviously difficult, but made so much easier by the care and professionalism of all the staff on the unit.' 

They added: 'We would also like to thank everyone for their love, kind words, donations, prayers and support over the past few weeks. 

'Without this our journey would have been so much harder.' 

The expat was left in a critical condition after reportedly losing control of her Jeep Wrangler 4x4 on her way home from a day out with friends on January 11.

Her car slammed into a tree and she sustained serious injuries to her back as well as a broken neck and pelvis. 

Ms Clayton had moved to Grand Cayman in December 2013 after leaving her job as an analyst at broadcaster Sky.

There she took up a job as a dive master with a company called Tortuga Divers, helping tourists explore the Caribbean Sea. 

Her funeral will take place in Southampton on March 6.
