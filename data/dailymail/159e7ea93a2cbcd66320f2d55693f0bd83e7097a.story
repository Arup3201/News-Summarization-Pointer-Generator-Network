Jack Wilshere is a major doubt for Arsenal's Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday – but his latest ankle injury is not expected to keep him out long-term.

The midfielder looked in considerable pain as he limped off against Manchester United at the Emirates on Saturday following a challenge by Paddy McNair. But he was able to walk out of the stadium after the game.

He is undergoing assessment on the ankle and a final prognosis is due on Tuesday.

Initial scans revealed that nothing was broken but the 22-year-old's ankle is sprained and club doctors are waiting for the swelling to reduce before making a final assessment.

In a worst-case scenario the England international could have sustained ligament damage but early indications are that the injury is not that serious.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is also a major doubt for the Borussia Dortmund match after injuring his hip in a collision with Kieran Gibbs. 

It is understood that his injury is also not expected to be long-term.
