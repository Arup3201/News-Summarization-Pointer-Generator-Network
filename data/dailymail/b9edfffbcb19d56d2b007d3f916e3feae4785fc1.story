James Bond creator Ian Fleming wanted Alfred Hitchcock to direct the first 007 movie, it has emerged.

A telegram sent in 1959 has revealed one of the biggest ‘what ifs’ in British cinema history and will leave James Bond fans shaken and stirred.

Fleming sent the communique in which he asked Hitchcock to take the helm of the first Bond film through a mutual friend.

Outlining the plot, the telegram was sent to novelist Eric Ambler, asking: 'Would Hitchcock be interested?'

He added: 'Have written Bond movie treatment featuring Mafia stolen atomic bomber blackmail of England culminating Nassau with extensive underwater dramatics.'

The plot in question was for 
Thunderball, which had originally been intended as the first Bond film 
and ended up being made in 1965, before it was decided Dr No should be the first movie in the franchise.

The telegram continued: 'This is for my friend Ivar Bryce’s Xanadu Films Ltd which recently completed Boy and Bridge, England’s choice for Venice festival but blasted by critics and flop at Curzon though now doing excellently on pre-release Rank circuit.

'Would Hitchcock be interested in directing this first Bond film in association with Xanadu?'

Fleming ended the telegram: 'Plentiful
finance available. This purely old boy enquiry without involvement but 
think we might all have a winner particularly if you were conceivably 
interested in scripting.'

His sign off was mistakenly transcribed 'regardest Ian Fleming'.

The telegram, sent in September 1959, has this week been posted on the website Letters Of Note.

The contents of Fleming's telegram came to light in The Battle For Bond by Robert Sellers, which details the origins of the 1965 film Thunderball, which was supposed to have been the first 007 film

Dr No eventually came out in 1962 and 
was directed by Terence Young, while its star Sean Connery went on to 
work with Hitchcock on 1964's Marnie.

The rejection meant there was no ‘Hitchcockian’ Bond, and Fleming offered the director role to Terence Young, who went on to direct three films in the series - Dr No, From Russia With Love and Thunderball.

Thunderball, which starred Sean Connery as Bond, proved a phenomenal hit at the box-office when it was eventually released in 1965, and remains the most financially successful Bond film, allowing for inflation.

It is remembered by fans for the behind-the-scenes dispute between Fleming and his screenwriters Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham who sued the author over claims he stole the original plot from them.

The letter emerged in the book The Battle For Bond by Robert Sellers, which chronicles this long-gestating copyright dispute surrounding Thunderball, which continued into the 1980s.

The 'unofficial' 1983 Bond film Never Say Never Again, which brought Connery back to the role after an absence of 12 years, was made as a result.
