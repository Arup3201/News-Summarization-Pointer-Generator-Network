Tragic: Powerboat racer William Nocker was travelling at speeds of 120mph

A British powerboat racer has been killed after his boat flipped and 'barrel rolled' at speeds of 120mph.

William Nocker was competing in the first race of the inaugural Gabon Grand Prix in west Africa when the accident happened.

The 47-year-old was rushed to a military hospital in Gabon's capital city Libreville but doctors were unable to resuscitate him.

His co-driver, Norwegian Kurt Olsen, was also badly hurt and remains in a critical condition in intensive care.

Witnesses said Mr Nocker's boat hit two waves and turned over. He had just returned to the sport following a five-year ban for tampering with a competitor's fuel supply.

A tribunal upheld charges of gross 
misconduct and unsportsmanlike behaviour against Mr Nocker and fellow 
racer Rob Lister after it was alleged water was poured into the tank of a
rival boat during the Liverpool Powerboat Grand Prix in 2006.

Race promoters H20 Racing said contact had been made with Mr Nocker's father Bill and brother James following the accident.

Mr Nocker, originally from Tiverton, Devon, was racing for the Welmax Offshore Racing team.

The race - the second round of the Class 1 world offshore championship - was immediately stopped following the accident as safety teams rushed to attend to the injured crew at the scene.

As a mark of respect organisers cancelled the next day's second round before abandoning the event completely.

The sport's governing body, Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM), has launched an investigation into the cause of the crash and plans to inspect the boat's wreckage.

Wreckage: The damaged powerboat after the high speed crash in Gabon which killed William Nocker

Gabon's prime minister Ndong Sima joined racing teams as they returned to the crash site today to pay tribute to Mr Nocker.

They held a minute's silence and laid a wreath on the water while competitors and team members scattered flowers.

Nicolo di San Germano, president of H20 Racing, said: "We are all extremely saddened by this tragic racing accident. There are very few suitable words at a time such as this but we all send our heartfelt condolences to William's family."

The Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to Mr Nocker's family.
