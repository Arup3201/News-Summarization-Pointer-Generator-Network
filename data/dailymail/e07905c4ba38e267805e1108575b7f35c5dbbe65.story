The father who brutally murdered his 20-year-old daughter and her boyfriend after the young couple eloped has defended his actions, saying he did 'the right thing.'

Narender Barak has confessed to Thursday's honour killings in north-west India, adding that more people should followed his example.

Nidhi Barak and her boyfriend Dharmender, 23, had run away from their village in the state of Haryana to marry in nearby Delhi, but returned on the promise they had her parents blessing.

Gruesome: The body of one of the two honor killing victims lies under a sheet in Gharnavati village in the Indian state of Haryana

When the young couple came back, fine 
arts student Nidhi was butchered to death by her family, including her 
father and mother Reeta, as shocked villagers in Gharnavati looked on.

The
killers then attacked Dharmender, who was studying at a local techincal
college, breaking the bones in his arms and legs before beheading him 
and dumping his body in front of his family home.

Narender Barak, a wrestler and dog breeder, confessed to the murders alongside his wife.

'Whatever I did was right and for honour,' he told local media.

'If others also follow the same path, then such things [marriages for love] won't take place.'

Police say they discovered the girl's parents cremating her body on a pyre. The body of the boyfriend was dumped outside his family home

The pair, both members of the Barak clan, had eloped toÂ  Delhi on Tuesday because their families did not approve of their three-year relationship.

However, Ms Barak was promised by her family that they would not be harmed and would finally be allowed to marry.

Miss
Barak's parents and uncle were arrested on Thursday and police are 
still trying to trace her brother and other family members who fled 
after the murders.

According to police the couple were tortured for several hours at Miss Barak's home before she was beaten to death in full public view.

Dharmender Barak
was beaten and his arms and legs broken, before he was beheaded. His 
body was allegedly dumped near his family's home at a public square in 
the village.

Police, who had been alerted by a villager, reportedly caught Miss Barak's family cremating her body on a pyre.

Her half-burnt body and that of Dharmender Barak have been sent for a post-mortem.

Local police chief Anil Kumar said: 'While murdering the boy they also beheaded him.

'We
have arrested her father, mother and uncle and we are looking for her 
brother, a friend and driver of the car in which the couple were brought
back to her home in Gharnavati village.

'Both belonged to the same village and the same caste. It is an honour killing but the murder was not approved by society.'

India has for centuries seen killings that often target young couples who have relationships of which their families, clans or communities, particularly in traditional rural areas, disapprove.

There are no official figures on honour killings in India, but the All India Democratic Women's Association says its research shows about 1,000 such cases nationwide a year.
