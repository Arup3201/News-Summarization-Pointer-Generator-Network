Tom Cleverley has met Aston Villa assistant boss Roy Keane to discuss a potential move as Manchester United's midfield clear-out continues.  

As Shinji Kagawa flew to in Germany on Friday afternoon to put the finishing touches to an £8million return to Borussia Dortmund, Cleverley, for whom Villa have bid £7m and who interests Everton, Hull and Valencia, went south to Birmingham. 

Old Trafford legend Keane has stepped in to try and lure the 25-year-old, with the promise of regular first-team football at the Midlands club.

What's around the corner? Tom Cleverley could be set for a move to Aston Villa before deadline day

Keane knows all about leaving Manchester following his controversial departure midway through the 2004-05 season, but Cleverley is still to decide where his future lies. 

The preferred option for the midfielder is to head out on loan for the remainder of the season and then leave Louis van Gaal's side on a free next summer.

Running down his contract and being able to move on a free would present the midfielder with the greatest array of options to move on after becoming a peripheral figure under the new manager.

Everton are among Cleverley's preferred options, should he move, as he has experience of working under Roberto Martinez during his loan spell at Wigan during the 2010-11 season. 

Heading for the exit? Kagawa is poised to seal a deal with his former club Borussia Dortmund

Kagawa, meanwhile, is close to reaching an agreement on a four-year deal at Dortmund as he flies over for a medical.

One or two personal details still have to be ironed out but Kagawa is confident they would not prevent him returning to the Westfalenstadion. 

Jurgen Klopp repeatedly made it clear the Japan midfielder would be welcomed back with open arms, and the Dortmund boss will get his wish.

Kagawa struggled to make his mark at Old Trafford after being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 for £12m - plus £5m add-ons - and became even more marginalised under David Moyes last season.

This is the end: The midfielder's days appear to be numbered at Old Trafford after management changes

Planning ahead: New United boss Louis van Gaal is insistent that he needs to revamp the beleaguered squad
