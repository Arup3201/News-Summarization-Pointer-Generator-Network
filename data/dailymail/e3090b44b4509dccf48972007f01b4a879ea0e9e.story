Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. 

The channels are almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower and are thought to stretch hundreds of kilometres along the ice shelf.

Scientists believe they have implications for ice-shelf stability around them but added that the long-term implications for the ice sheet are still unknown.

Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. The finding was made using the British Antarctic Survey's Twin Otter survey plane (pictured) which collected data about the size of the sub-ice-shelf channel

The British researchers used satellite images and airborne radar measurements to reveal the channels under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica.

The channels can be seen on the surface of the ice shelf, as well as underneath, because the ice floats at a different height depending on its thickness.

'The biggest challenge was the lack of field data that is available to investigate the nature of the channels, we can observe them from above in the satellite imagery, but have little direct observations from radar,' Dr Anne Le Brocq from the University of Exeter, told MailOnline.

Using what data they had, the researchers were able to predict the path of meltwater flowing under parts of the ice which were in contact with the land.

The ice shelf channel is clearly visible on the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica image map. The predicted flow route of water beneath the grounded ice sheet aligns with the initiation of the ice shelf channel. The dashed line marks the point at which the ice starts to float

They discovered that these channels 
lined up with areas where similar flows of water are thought to exist 
under the ice shelf at the point where the ice starts to float.

According to the researchers, the match-up indicates that the water flow beneath the grounded ice sheet is responsible for the formation of the channels beneath the floating ice shelf.

'It was a bit of a “Eureka moment” when I found the predicted water flow routes lined up with the channels,' said Dr Le Brocq. 'They provide us with a very useful way of investigating an otherwise fairly inaccessible environment.'

When the meltwater flowing under the ice sheet enters the ocean beneath, it causes a plume of ocean water to form, which then melts out the vast channels under the ice shelf. 

Previously, it was thought that water flowed in a thin layer beneath the ice sheet, but the evidence from this study suggests it flows in a more focused manner, much like rivers. 

The way in which water flows beneath the ice sheet strongly influences the speed of ice flow.

Schematic diagram shows the approximate scale of one of the ice shelf channels, similar in height to the Eiffel Tower, and Tower Bridge in width. Scientists believe the channels are weakening areas of ice immediately around them

Vast channels such as this have been 
observed elsewhere, but their formation has been credited to purely 
oceanic processes rather than meltwater flowing out of the grounded ice 
sheet. 

'Unlike in Greenland where meltwater is produced at the surface, this meltwater is generated beneath the ice sheet so there isn’t a direct link to climate change,' said Dr Le Brocq. 

'However, in order to make predictions about how the ice sheet will respond to environmental change in the future, we need to understand the mechanisms by which ice flows and how it interacts with the ocean.' 

Dr Le Brocq said she now hopes to carry out more field investigations into the channels using radar measurements, and will further investigate the formation of the plumes using a computer model.

The project, which was reported in the 
journal Nature GeoScience, involved the University of Exeter, Newcastle 
University, the University of Bristol, the University of Edinburgh, the 
British Antarctic Survey and the University of York.
