Recovering: British diplomat George Fergusson, 56, with wife Margaret at their south London home after he lost an eye in the attack

A senior diplomat has been left blind in one eye after being mugged while taking a shortcut through a London cemetery.

George Fergusson, who is about to become the new governor of Bermuda, was on his way to meet his wife Margaret at a dinner party when the hooded attacker struck.

Police believe the Old Etonian was targeted because he was using his BlackBerry smartphone to check his host’s address.

Mr Fergusson was walking through 
Hammersmith Cemetery in West London when the mugger ran up from behind. 
As the diplomat turned round, he was punched in the eye with such force 
that he was knocked to the ground.

The 56-year-old, a former high 
commissioner to New Zealand and governor of Pitcairn, managed to hold on
 to the BlackBerry in the ensuing struggle and seconds later the mugger 
fled, having managed to take only a small quantity of cash.

Dazed and bleeding heavily from his 
left eye socket, Mr Fergusson managed to stagger to his feet and 
telephone his wife, a senior official at the British Council, to excuse 
his absence from the party before walking into the nearby Charing Cross 
hospital.

He was transferred to the Western Eye 
Hospital in London, but despite specialists’ efforts, he has now 
permanently lost his vision in the left eye.

A spokesman for the Foreign  and 
Commonwealth Office said  Mr Fergusson had left hospital yesterday 
morning and was now recovering from his ordeal at home in Lambeth, South
 London.

She said the attack at 7.30pm  on 
Friday evening had left Mr Fergusson considerably shaken but said he 
still planned to take up his post in Bermuda in May.

Yesterday his wife told friends: ‘The 
attacker thumped him straight in the eye, knocked him to the ground and 
knocked him around a bit.’

Oxford-educated Mr Fergusson, who 
earns £143,000 a year, is from a grand Scottish family with a proud 
record in both the British Army and the diplomatic service.

The family, whose motto is ‘All the 
sweeter for having undergone bitterness’, has already suffered more than
 its share of tragedy. In 2005, their son Alexander, 20, was killed when
 he was hit by a taxi while pushing his bicycle across a bus lane in 
London’s Piccadilly.

In 1979 he lost his mother Laura, a 
sister-in-law of the actress Joyce Grenfell, when gales blew a tree on 
to the car she was travelling in near her home in Scotland.

A year later, just two months before 
Mr Fergusson’s wedding to Margaret, with whom he also has three 
daughters, his father Lord Ballantrae suffered a stroke and died.

Scotland Yard said it was satisfied that robbery was the only motive.

Last night it said that a man aged 29 
had been arrested on suspicion of robbery and was detained in a West 
London police station.
