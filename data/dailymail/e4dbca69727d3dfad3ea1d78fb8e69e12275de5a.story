Ilie Wacs prefers not to moralize on the twist of fate which led his family to escape the Holocaust but refuses to play down the courage of the man who saved them - a young tailor who worked for his father but was also an SS officer.

Mr Wacs and his sister Deborah Strobin were only children in Vienna, Austria, when the Nazis rose to power in the 1930s.

As the fascists' grip tightened on Jews across Europe, it would be the warning of the young man called Alois which led to the Wachs family's escape to Italy, then on a boat to Shanghai and finally, America.

In their co-authored book, An Uncommon Journey, the siblings write: 'Alois came to our house. His tone was 
quite grave, and he convinced Papa that something terrible was going to 
happen.

'I could tell it was dangerous for him even to be seen in our 
home. He told Papa, ''Gather your family tonight. Tell them to come here.
Keep everyone inside. You will not be touched.'''

The nights in question were November 9 and 10, 1938, known as Kristallnacht, or 'The Night of Broken Glass' among the Jewish community. 

Over the two nights, waves of violence were unleashed against the Jews throughout Germany, annexed Austria and areas of recently-occupied Czechoslovakia.

Mr Wacs and Mrs Strobin will commemorate the 75th-anniversary of Kristallnacht by sharing their family's story on November 10 at the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance in Los 
Angeles.

While the family hid silently inside 
their apartment, they heard the heavy boots of Nazi officers at 
their front door. But no one knocked.

The book reads: 'We were passed over. We were shielded by Alois. We were saved.'

Siblings Deborah Strobin and Ilie Wacs have written a book, An Uncommon Journey, about their escape from the Nazis during WW2. They are on a mission to find the SS soldier Alois who helped them

Businesses and properties owned by Jews were the target of vicious Nazi mobs during a night of vandalism that is known as Kristallnacht in November 1938 across Germany, annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia

Soon afterwards, the siblings escaped with their parents to Italy and then on a boat to Shanghai, changing their name from Wachs to Wacs.

They later moved to America. Mr Wacs, a retired fashion designer, lives in New York City and his sister is a renowned philanthropist in San Francisco.

The siblings have spent a long time looking for Alois, or his relatives, so that they can finally thank the man they refer to as the 'Righteous Gentile' for saving their lives.

The brother and sister have scant details - only that Alois was in his twenties and head tailor of their father's business at no 7 Lilienbrungasse, Wein 2, in Vienna for a period, including the years 1937 - 1939. He was also a member of the local Nazi party.

Mr Wacs, now an artist, told the Huffington Post that if he ever found Alois, he would simply 'thank him for saving our lives'.

On his family's miracle escape, Mr Wacs said: 'There is no moral. Life is random. Survival is primarily a matter of luck. We survived because of that man, but if that man hadn't been around, we wouldn't have survived. It's difficult to draw moral conclusions.'

The Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance marks the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht on November 10.

A month-long exhibition of Mr Wac's artwork is currently showing at the Museum of Tolerance New York.
