Men who wonder how good they are in bed and want to find out if their partner actually faked that orgasm can now find out the truth - all thanks to modern technology.

Applying a device to monitor their performance may sound like something of a passion killer but the makers promise it will improve the wearer's sexual prowess.

Bondara, a British online retailer of intimate toys, are developing the product which they've called a 'SexFit'.

Need help in the bedroom? A new app can monitor a man's performance and then tell them what rhythm to stick to (posed by models)

It states: 'The SexFit is worn on the male genitalia and once connected to the mobile app via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, records key statistics and uses vibrations to set a recommended pace. 

'Users can track how well they are keeping to the pre-programmable 'training' sessions through LED lights at the top of the tracker. When the centre light is lit, the user is hitting peak performance and matching the rhythm set by the training programme. Too many lights and the user will need to slow down and not enough lights will advise them to pick up the pace.'

It added that users will be able to use a button on the gadget to adjust the speed of their 'training session' during their 'workout'.

Once recovered, the men can then embrace their inner geeks by logging on to the free accompanying SexFit app for a full appraisal of their performance.

Attach before 'working out': The device called a 'SexFit' lights up and has speed controls

They will be able to find out how many calories they burnt between the sheets and their number of thrusts per minute.

Those without inhibitions can ever share and compare their results on social media - although most of your friends and family would probably prefer it if you didn't.

Speaking about the prototype, Louise Bagley, head buyer for Bondara said: 'The digital health and quantified-self craze has started to infiltrate all aspects of our lives.

Too much information: The app even allows you to share your results on social media

'Our device is a natural fit alongside the influx of these personal health trackers and with the added benefit of improving an individuals sex life, we expect it to be a huge hit when it becomes available. 

'With over half of all couples in the UK using a sex toy, this is a massive market driven by innovation.

'That's why we've invested in developing the next evolution of toys, which we hope will bring joy to millions of couples who want to upgrade their intimacy.'

The product is expected to go on sale Spring 2015.
