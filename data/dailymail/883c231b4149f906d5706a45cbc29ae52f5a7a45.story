Police say an elf on the sauce is facing drunk driving charges in New Jersey.

Riverdale police tell NJ.com  that 23-year-old Brian Chellis was found passed out in a car early Friday morning wearing an Elf on the Shelf costume.

Lt. James Macintosh says the Cedar Grove man was asleep behind the wheel of a van with its engine running, lights on and music blaring. 

He says Chellis was in a red shirt, red pants, and white ruffled collar,NJ.com reports. 

Macintosh says that Chellis seemed confused about where he was and had an open can of beer in the car.

Chellis was taken to police headquarters for a breath test after being given a series of field sobriety tests.  

He was issued a summons and released to a family member.

A message left seeking comment from Chellis wasn't immediately returned Saturday.
