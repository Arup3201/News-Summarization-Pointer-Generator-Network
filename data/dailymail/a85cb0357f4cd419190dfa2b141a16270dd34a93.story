The man arrested in pre-dawn raids across Sydney in September has been hit with three new terror-related charges.

While the original charge of planning an act of terror against Omarjan Azari, 22, still stands, prosecutors on Friday conceded the alleged act was not a beheading and was not planned for Martin Place, the scene of this week's siege.

Azari appeared by video link from Silverwater prison after being transported from the Supermax jail in Goulburn, ahead of a planned bail application. 

During Friday's hearing he was charged with three fresh counts - two of knowingly making funds available to a terrorist organisation and one of attempting to make funds available to a terrorist organisation.

Azari has been charged along with a 25-year-old man who was arrested in Beecroft in Sydney and taken into custody earlier this week.

Azari is charged along with Ali Al-Talebi with transferring money to ISIS via two Western Sydney money transfer businesses.  

Police allege that on August 6, Azari and other males went to a Travelex store in Parramatta Westfield Shopping Centre and deposited $3000, which was to go via Pakistan to Australian ISIS recruiter Mohammad Ali Baryalei in Syria.

Prosecution screw up: Prominent Sydney barrister, Winston Terracini SC, (pictured) told a Sydney court last month that a phone call at the centre of the case against accused terrorist, Omarjan Azari, had a 'glaring error' in its translation from Arabic to English. He also said authorities had conspired to deny Azari any prison visits by his family

Azari allegedly waited outside the Travelex as the other males deposited the money. The following day, August 7, Azari allegedly transferred $3000, in the company of other males, to Syria via Pakistan at the Western Union money transfer shop in Auburn in Western Sydney.

The money was going to Baryalei via a man in Peshawar called Zia Abdulhaq, who has since been killed.

Then on August 8, Azari and Al-Taledi attempted to transfer $9211 to Syria at the Bisotel Rieh Travel Agency, which is owned by the sister of Australian Syrian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf. 

The agency, which is operated by Damour Sharrouf and her husband, Ahmed Alwash, has since been shut down by federal agencies.

Azari's lawyer, Steve Boland, said  widespread media coverage claiming Azari had planned a beheading and chosen Martin Place for the act was nonsense and that it would be almost impossible for Azari to get a fair trial given the 'extraordinary circumstances and the public atmosphere at the moment'.

'It has emerged that the Crown has absolutely no evidence of such a thing,' Mr Boland said about allegations Azar was planning to publicly behead a member of the public in Martin Place, video the killing and then drape the victims body with a ISIS flag. 

Commonwealth prosecutor Michael Allnutt said that in the charges against Azari, there had never been any mention of an execution in Martin Place. 

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call  on September 16 from former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) in Syria to a man outside Omarjan Azari's house in Guildford in western Sydney and a plot to behead a person and drape them in the ISIS flag was discussed

Azari's bail application will now go ahead on February 24 on the three new charges of financing terrorist activity in Syria.

Last month, lawyers for Azari claimed there was a a 'glaring error' in the federal prosecution case against him, saying the official translation of a phone call at the centre of the police evidence against the 22-year-old apprentice mechanic.

Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini SC also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - was being kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit.

Azarai, a former soccer fanatic and Parramatta High School student who grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, was arrested on September 18 at his parents' home in Guildford in what was one of dozens of raids in a counter-terrorism operation by hundreds of police on homes in Sydney and Brisbane.

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Azari and former Sydney nightclub bouncer, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East. 

Mr Terracini told Central Local Court magistrate Greg Grogin in November that he had already had an Arabic speaker listen to the phone call in which prosecutors allege Azari made the threat to behead a person in Sydney's Martin Place.

Prominent Sydney barrister Winston Terracini also said Azari - who is being held in Australia's toughest jail, Supermax in Goulburn - has been kept apart from his family who are not allowed to visit

'There is at least one glaring error which goes to the crux of whether this young man is involved in a terrorist act,' Mr Terracini said of the prosecution's translation of the phone call. 

Mr Terracini said despite the Commonwealth DPP serving many documents in its brief of evidence against Azari, 'only one piece of evidence is relevant'.

'It seems to be the fact there is only one telephone call ... and there are inaccuracies in the translation.' 

Around 12 homes were searched on September 18 in Sydney’s northwest suburbs by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police (AFP).

Azari has been in custody in in the Supermax High Risk Management correctional centre for three months since the raids.

Mr Terracini said Azari had been prevented from seeing his family by Corrective Services and prosecutors conspiring in a 'secret' agreement to ban 'visitors of any kind ... family, his parents who have no criminal convictions, his sister who has no conviction'.

Commonwealth prosecutor Karen Leavy told the court her office had 'no influence' over inmate classification. 

Mr Terracini said Azari's defence team was not interested in the 180 or more documents gathered by the Commonwealth DPP and that the telephone allegedly used in the call from which the terrorism charge arose did not belong to the accused.

'We are interested in the phone used allegedly by this man which the prosecution knows was not his,' Mr Terracini said.

Azari is accused of conspiring with Baryalei 'and others' in planning a terrorist act between 12.01am on March 8 this year and 4.30am on September 18, the time and date of his arrest.

Following Omarjan Azari's arrest, heavily armed police (pictured) escorted him from Central Local Court down to the Goulburn Supermax Jail where he has been held under strict conditions

Azari was arrested the day after his parents left Australia to fly to Saudi Arabia for the religious holiday, the Hajj. 

The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP)said was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'.

CDPP prosecutor Michael Allnutt told Central Local Court during Omarjan Azari's first court appearance on the day he was arrested that he had had made a threat during a phone call a few days prior to the raid which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'.

Azari had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police, Mr Allnutt said.

Court documents suggest the plotting for a public beheading between Omarjan Azarai, Baryalei 'and others' began on May 8, and prosecutors say Azari knew he was under police surveillance

Court documents suggest their plotting began on May 8, and the court heard Azari knew he was under police surveillance.

Azari is being held in Supermax under NSW prisons highest security classification, which means he would not be allowed to hold telephone conversations in any language but English.

Even his visits from his legal team have been in the metal-lined legal boxes inside Supermax.
