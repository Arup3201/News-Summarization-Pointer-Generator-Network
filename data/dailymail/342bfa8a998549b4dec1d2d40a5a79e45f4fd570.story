The Kinks may re-form to release a new album and tour, following the success of a play about the rise of the band in the Sixties.

The band, fronted by brothers Ray and Dave Davies, is acknowledged as one of Britain’s most influential rock bands with hits such as Lola.

After constant speculation following their acrimonious break up in 1996, Ray has now revealed the band may record and tour together once again.

Responsible for such hits as You Really 
Got Me and Waterloo Sunset, the violent disputes between the two brothers evolved into one of the longest running feuds in rock 'n' roll.

'I met Dave only last week to talk about getting back together again,'  69-year-old Ray told The Sunday Times.

'We've also spoken a few times on the phone and emailed. He's been composing his own songs, but I'd really like to write with him again.'

The two formed the band in the early 1960s and their first major hit, You Really Got Me, came along only a year later.

They went on to become one of the most 
influential rock groups of a generation and influenced countless other 
British bands, including Oasis and Blur.

Oasis mirrored them closely in their own sibling rivalry, with brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher frequently falling out and bickering.

It is not the first time a Kinks reunion has been mooted.

In 2010, Dave said there would never be a reunion, adding: 'Ray sucks me dry of ideas, emotions and ­creativity. It’s toxic for me to be with him. He’s a control freak.'

The Kinks were formed in Muswell Hill, North London, by brothers Dave Davies and Ray Davies in 1963.

Their first hit single, You Really Got Me, came the following year and propelled them to stardom.

They went on to write and record dozens of hits, most famously Lola and Waterloo Sunset.

In 1990, the four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The band separated in 1996, due to the creative tension between Ray and Dave and their declining commercial success.

During their decades as a band, the two brothers' were known for their bickering and dust-ups, reportedly including fights on stage.

Although Dave rubbished reports of a reunion only a few years ago, Ray claims he has spoken to his brother recently about a possible reunion and said he wants to write music with him again.

He labelled his brother an 'a**hole and a narcissist'.

However, a musical detailing The Kinks' rise to stardom is reported to have been the reason for the latest change of heart.

Sunny Afternoon, which ran in Hampstead Theatre earlier this year, detailed the band's rise to fame.

The musical received a five star review from Mail Online in May.

In 1990, The Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004, Ray was awarded a CBE for services to music.

The brothers' volatile ­relationship has often been credited for much of The Kinks’ success, but it also drove both brothers half-crazy.

Dave sought escape in drugs and more recently in spirituality. And Ray attempted suicide (he was later diagnosed with bipolar ­disorder, also known as manic depression).

Dave also suffered a stroke in 2004, describing how his body seized up and he couldn't move his arm or leg.

Ray is also no stranger to injury - he was shot by a mugger when visiting New Orleans 10 years' ago.

Since the dissolution of The Kinks, Ray has formed a solo musical career.
