A war veteran who vanished from his care home to attend the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations in France has left his  £600,000 estate to lifeboat charity the RNLI.

Bernard Jordan – nicknamed the Great Escaper after his cross-Channel adventure last year – died peacefully in hospital aged 90 on December 30.

Mr Jordan hit the headlines last summer when he travelled to the 70th anniversary D-Day events in Normandy wearing his war medals and grey mac.

He slipped out of The Pines care home in Hove, East Sussex, telling carers he was going for a walk – but in reality he hopped on a ferry to France.

Hero: Bernard Jordan, the 90-year-old war veteran who broke out of his care home in East Sussex to attend the D-Day commemorations in Normandy, pictrured with new friend in France, has left £600,000 to the RNLI

Loss: Irene Jordan (pictured with Bernard), 88, died a week after  the death of her husband and the details of their will have been revealed

Second World War veteran Mr Jordan, a former Royal Navy member and ex-mayor of Hove, said on his return that his aim was to remember his fallen ‘mates’.

His wife Irene, who was in the same care home, died seven days after her husband, aged 88, and today it emerged the couple's entire estate has been left to ensure lives are saved at sea.

In love: Mr Jordan, pictured on their wedding day in 1946, said when he fled his care home:  ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss. I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss'

RNLI chief executive Paul Boissier today praised Mr Jordan's spirit, which he said is shared by the volunteers who risk their lives to save people lost at sea all around the coasts of the UK every day.

He said: 'This is absolutely wonderful, unexpected news.

'Bernard's story charmed the nation last year when he journeyed from his Sussex care home to France to commemorate the D-Day landings.

'That spirit, that determination, is embedded deep within the psyche of our volunteer lifeboat crews who go to sea to save others in peril on the sea.

'I am delighted that the couple chose to leave us this sizeable donation, and their contribution, like those of Bernard's veteran peers, will never be forgotten.'

An RNLI spokesman said the legacy came as a 'huge surprise' but believed the couple's admiration stemmed from Mr Jordan's time in the Royal Navy in the Second World War.

Guy Rose, the legal admin manager for the RNLI, said: 'This is a wonderful gift from Bernard and Irene.

'He really made a name for himself last year and there can't be many who weren't touched by his story.

'Gifts left in wills are so valuable to the RNLI and they ensure we can continue our life-saving work for people in, on or near the water.'

A ceremony celebrating Mr and Mrs Jordan’s lives will be held at All Saints Church in Hove on January 30 followed by a private funeral.

A minute’s silence will be held at the next full meeting of Brighton and Hove City Council to remember the couple.

Mr Jordan had, in past interviews, referred to his wife as a ‘smashing woman’.

Mr Jordan’s disappearance sparked a police search last June 5 and his whereabouts emerged only when a younger veteran phoned later that night to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe.

He described how he kept his exploit secret from his wife. On the morning he left, he dressed and put on his medals, making sure to hide them under his blue mac before he said goodbye to Irene.

‘I didn’t want to make a fuss,’ he said at the time. ‘I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss.

'I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.” Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out.’ 

Hero's welcome: He sparked a nationwide search after escaping from his care home and sneaking to France for the Normandy commemorations. He was later applauded for his escapade 

Final journey: Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this year and Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life

He had decided to join British veterans, most making their final pilgrimage to revisit the scene of their momentous invasion, to remember the heroes of the liberation of Europe.

Some 156,000 Allied troops landed on the five invasion beaches on June 6 1944, sparking an 80-day campaign to liberate Normandy involving three million troops and costing 250,000 lives.

Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this June. Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life after learning of his exploits.

Following his death, the Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan’s decision to go to France highlighted ‘the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation’.

On his 90th birthday, days after he returned from his escapade, he was inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world.
