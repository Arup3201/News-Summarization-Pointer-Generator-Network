John Guidetti has set his sights on becoming the first Celtic striker to score a hat-trick against Rangers in 41 years.

Celtic’s top scorer has gone six domestic games without a goal - and limped out of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat to PSV Eindhoven in Gran Canaria with a dead leg.

Rubbishing talk of a scoring crisis or a loss of form, however, Guidetti insisted his confidence in front of goal remains sky high. And looking ahead to next month’s League Cup semi-final, the Swede said he wants to become the first Celtic striker to score a hat-trick against their fierce city rivals since Harry Hood at the same stage of the same competition in 1973.

Asked if he fancied himself for a goal at Hampden, the on-loan Manchester City star said: ‘I fancy three. That is what I did against Ajax when I was with Feyenoord and that is the aim this time.

‘The dream would be to score - but the most important thing is we win against Rangers. Big games are what I love the most. That is why I wake up in the morning.’

Guidetti’s form has shaded since a prolific start to life in Glasgow, claiming 11 goals in his first 12 games.

His Manchester City contract is up next summer and Celtic have first call on his services in a permanent deal.

Denying that negotiations over his future are affecting his on-field focus, however, the striker added: ‘I am not part of that. My agent is speaking with the club.

‘I want to play football and I am really happy here. Everyone knows I love it at the club.

‘It’s between my agent and the club so I leave them to it. I let my agent do his job.

‘It’s not affecting me at all. It’s not like I am thinking I don’t want to score because of my contract. No, that would be stupid.

‘My agent will do what he does best - being an agent. He doesn’t tell me to take the ball with the inside of my foot on the pitch, so I don’t tell him how to do his job.

‘You don’t bring an electrician into your house and tell him how to fit the plugs.

‘It’s his job and I trust him to do what is best.

‘I am not worried. I am just so happy to wear the Celtic shirt. The rest will work itself out, it always does.

‘I’ll just try to stay fit and strong and the goals will come back. Everyone can be calm.’
