Could switching on the TV prevent you from switching off?

After a long, stressful day at work, kicking back in front of the TV might seem like the best way to unwind. But a new study found that rather than helping us relax, watching TV can make us feel more worse than when we started.

The study, by researchers at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany, and VU University Amsterdam, found that people who had high stress levels after work and watched TV or played video games didn't feel relaxed or recovered, but instead had high levels of guilt and feelings of failure.

The study, titled 'The Guilty Couch Potato', surveyed 471 participants about how they felt after work and what media they had use to unwind.

They found that people who were particularly tired after work showed a higher tendency to feel they had 'succumbed to their desire' when describing their TV or gaming use.

This group of people also reported that their TV watching had prevented them 'taking care of more important tasks'.

In other words, instead of taking enjoyment from switching on the box or playing games, this hard-working bunch felt guilty about it.

'These feelings of guilt diminished the positive effects of media use and reduced recovery and vitality after media use,' reports the study, which has recently been published in the Journal of Communication.

The results also found a surprising paradox: people who were most exhausted and therefore could have benefited most from relaxing in front of the TV, actually benefited least because they felt most guilty and took their TV habit as a sign of their own self-control failure.

This research sheds new light on the effects TV and gaming. Previous studies have found that this sort of media use helps us to detach from work stress and to relax.

Research has also found that winning in a computer game or watching a thought-provoking movie gives people a feeling of control during leisure time, which in turn makes them feel more energized and can even increase cognitive performance.

Leonard Reinecke, one of 'The Guilty Couch Potato' authors says of their findings, 'It demonstrates that in real life, the relationship between media use and well-being is complicated and that the use of media may conflict with other, less pleasurable but more important duties and goals in everyday life.'Â 

So next time you're heading for the couch after work, think before you flick.
