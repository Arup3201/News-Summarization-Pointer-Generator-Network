An American luxury travel magazine has put together the ultimate UK weekend for its readers with a price tag far from the classic package holiday.

For £1million ($1.6million) readers of Elite Traveler, a special publication for fans of private jets, will be given the full UK experience, including private tours of some of our most famous attractions, meals cooked by top chefs and a helicopter tour of the Scottish Highlands.

The three day experience sees one U.S. couple travel across the pond in a private jet with destination London.

Jet, set, go: The £1million UK weekend will see high-end U.S. travellers take a luxury Eclipse 500 private jet across the pond to being three days of decadence in the British capital

Upon arrival they are picked up in a  
Rolls Royce Phantom chauffeur driven car stocked with £25,000 a kilo 
Almas Caviar canapes and Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle Champagne.

Their ride will take them to five-star
hotel 45 Park Lane which for the duration of their stay will have no 
other guests, costing £117,900 per night.

‘While top hotels rarely publicise 
this fact,’ shares Tova Syrowicz, travel editor at the Elite Traveler 
Media Group, ‘they can usually be booked for full takeovers regardless 
of how many guests make up your party.

When you're the only two people 
staying at a 45-room hotel, there's definitely no need for reception and
you know the level of service will be astronomical, simply out of this 
world.’

When you pay out a million pounds, 
exclusivity is to be expected. And with only three days to dispense, you
have got to make sure you see all the main attractions.

Height of luxury: After being picked up by a limousine stocked with £25,000 a kilo caviar, the couple arrive at five-star 45 Park Lane where they will be the only people staying for two nights

Occupy London(Eye): No need for queues for this couple as they will be have a private ride on the iconic London Eye as part of the exclusive package

No traitors: The wealthy visitors will be taken on a private tour of the Tower of London before enjoying a banquet prepared by two Michelin star chef Brett Graham

So the first night for the wealthy 
pair includes exclusive access to both the Tower of London and the 
London Eye, followed by a banquet prepared by

rising super-chef Brett Graham of The Ledbury restaurant.

‘Put together one of the world's, 
never mind Britain's most historic structures that has witnessed some of
the greatest moments in history, with a private feast masterminded by 
one of the country's leading culinary innovators, and you have an 
unforgettable first night in London,’ Ms Syrowicz says.

The following day – after a spot of 
shopping at Harvey Nichols of course – the pair are flown out to  
Coworth Park, in Ascot Berkshire,  to enjoy a polo match played 
specifically for the jet-setting couple.

Joining them in a private VIP lounge is former England captain Andrew Hine, who will act as a personal commentator.

Tough times: As if London was not enough, the pair are flown to Oxfordshire to dine at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons

Top chef: Wile at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, Michelin star chef Raymond Blanc will be on hand to provide a nine-course dining experience before they are jetted back to the capital

Off to the highlands: In order to fully appreciate Britain in all its glory, the U.S. couple will be flown to Gleneagles hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, for their final day of excess

The evening meal is described as ‘a 
short helicopter flight away’ at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons Relais 
& Châteaux hotel in Oxfordshire where Michelin star chef Raymond 
Blanc will give the guests a private cooking lesson before they sit down
to indulge in a 9-course bespoke dining experience.

But the high-spending couple need not 
worry about only seeing one side of Britain during their three days as 
the Sunday starts early with a flight to Scotland and the world-famous 
Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire.

One would probably need a change of 
clothes after the flight, as Scotland’s pride and joy of the greens; 
Colin Montgomerie, awaits them to play a round of golf.

After the game the American duo will 
be treated to classic British dishes including lamb hotpot and pickled 
red cabbage, beer-battered haddock with goose-fat chips and pea puree 
and, of course, haggis.

As lunch sinks in, they will be taken on a private helicopter ride of the Highland’s and lochs of Scotland.

Paying for pro: After shelling out £1million for one weekend, you wouldn't expect anything less than a legend teaching you how to play golf - fortunately Colin Montgomerie is at hand for the flash couple

Famous grass: The round will take place on the exclusive golf course at Gleneagles Hotel during the couple's Scotland day

Teatime: The idyllic setting of the Inverlochy hotel in the Scottish Highlands where the pair will touch down for a high tea break during a helicopter flight around the Highlands and Islands

Worth a million bucks: After a fully packed weekend, the couple will return to the US in - what else - a private jet

However, as private tours can be 
exhausting, the flight will touch down midway for high tea at the 
spectacular Inverlochy Castle Relais & Châteaux Hotel.

Back at Gleneagles, a private dinner by top cook Andrew 
Fairlie is laid out for the tired travellers, before they finally retire to the top floor of the hotel, 
which is theirs in its entirety for the duration of their stay.

After breakfast and last luxury 
helicopter flight to the Private jet terminal it's quickly onto the 
Private jet for the flight back to the U.S.

‘Whether it's being 
treated to some of the most exclusive Michelin-star dining around, 
marvelling at the breathtaking beauty of the Scottish Highlands or 
taking your own 
private tour of Buckingham Palace, the UK's appeal as a luxury 
destination continues,' says VisitBritain Marketing Director Joss Croft .

'The UK has an amazing array of unique and unforgettable
experiences waiting to be enjoyed by those with more exquisite tastes.’
