A 70-year-old woman is critically ill today after she jumped into a freezing river to save her Jack Russell dog.

A 55-year-old passer-by leapt in to rescue her when she passed out in the Avon near Pulteney Weir in the centre of Bath yesterday.

Firefighters helped pull the pensioner from the water before she was rushed to the city's Royal United Hospital, where she is still seriously ill.

The dog was unhurt and is being cared for at the Bath Cats and Dogs Home.

Rescue: This is the moment the unconscious pensioner was pulled from the River Avon after jumping in to save her Jack Russell 

Drama: The woman, 70, was unconscious when she was pulled from the water and through the railings onto the tow path by the river

Care: She was treated by the water while another man who jumped in to help her was dragged from the water by other passers-by

Paul Powis, from Worcester, said: 'The woman was unconscious, they were in the freezing cold water for at least 20 minute.

'The brave man had to battle strong currents as he kept her head out of the water. I was worried he was going to get swept away. He absolutely saved the woman's life.'

The rescuer was named as sportswear designer Glenn Hunter.

His proud daughter Maddie said: 'He is an amazing dad. He did not want any praise or publicity, he just wanted to make sure the woman was all right. I just wanted to say how proud I am of him.'.

Dash for help: The paramedics and firefighters carried the woman up the steep bank and away to a waiting ambulance 

Hero: A 55-year-old passer-by dived in and is believed to be Glenn Hunter, who will be recommended for a bravery award by police

Tribute: Mr Hunter's daughter's Maddie said today she is 'proud' of her 'amazing dad' who did not 'want any praise or publicity'

Dangerous: The stretch of the Avon where woman jumped in is close to Pulteney Weir in the centre of Bath, where there are strong currents

'My dad said he was in the river for about 20 minutes, the woman was unconscious, and he had no way to get out.'

Avon and Somerset Police said today they would be recommending Mr Hunter for a bravery award.
