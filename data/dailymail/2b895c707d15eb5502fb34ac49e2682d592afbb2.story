The alleged killers of two British backpackers have been paraded by police and used in a bizarre re-enactment of the crime on a Thai beach.

Crowds of onlookers watched as the two Burmese labourers replayed the murders, one holding a dustpan in place of the alleged weapon – a garden hoe.

The accused, who have allegedly confessed to the crime, wore white motorcycle helmets and handcuffs for the reconstruction – a common practice in Thai murder cases – on the beach where Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found bludgeoned to death on September 15.

Replaying horror: Burmese barman 'Win' (kneeling over actor) shows officers how he and his friend 'Saw' (left in white helmet) beat British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller to death on the Thai beach

Explain: Displaying little emotion as they stood on the Koh Tao beach where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found bludgeoned to death, the men gave officers detailed information of the killings

Identified only by the names ‘Win’ and ‘Saw’, the men were held after it was revealed that their DNA matched samples collected from the victims’ bodies.

Members of the British media were also asked to take part in the operation to recreate the scene of the killings on Sairee beach.

BBC correspondent Jonah Fisher refused. He tweeted: ‘Bizarrely asked to be David Miller in Thai reconstruction on Koh Tao. Sky News lady took Hannah role.’

The labourers are alleged to have raped Miss Witheridge before killing her. Police chief Somyot Poompanmoung told reporters in Koh Tao that the DNA of the men matched samples found on the deceased.

Grisly: Thai police carry out a 'reconstruction' of the brutal murder, with an actor (pictured lying on sand) playing one of the victims.

The authorities also said they had CCTV footage to support their case and Miss Witheridge’s mobile phone was found in the men’s bungalow.

DNA taken from cigarette butts of the same L&M brand which were found near the crime scene matched samples found on Miss Witheridge, police added, and Win was caught on CCTV footage buying L&M cigarettes.

A third man who was arrested with Win and Saw has been discounted.

The police chief said: ‘Tests show that DNA samples of the two Burmese matched the DNA [traces] collected by the police.’

On the night of the murder, the two men were drinking, playing a guitar, smoking and singing on the beach when they saw the two victims kissing, were aroused and decided to get rid of Mr Miller by drowning and beating him before attacking Miss Witheridge, it was reported.

Method: Win and Saw (both wearing white helmets) pose for photographs as they show police officers how their victims were struck over the head with a garden hoe

Gathering: The suspects (Win, right and Saw, left - both in white helmets) sit either side of a police officer explaining how the murders were carried out. Win is pictured holding an acoustic guitar 

Murdered: The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. Autopsies showed that Miss Witheridge died from head wounds while Mr Miller suffered severe blows to the head and drowned in the surf

The pair face allegations of murder, rape and theft, but have not yet been formally charged, the police chief said.

The two migrant workers are expected to remain in custody until they are brought to court.

Police lieutenant general Decha Butrnamphech said: ‘I am very satisfied with the investigation.’ Two years ago Thai police said they would stop public reconstructions of crimes using alleged perpetrators after complaints that they prejudiced trials – but they resumed after a few months. The reconstruction follows weeks of pressure on police to find the murderers of the British backpackers.

There has also been growing criticism over the standard of the investigation, from not sealing off the crime scene quickly enough to letting potential suspects leave the island.

Migrant workers, particularly from neighbouring Myanmar, have been used as scapegoats for crimes in Thailand.

The rape and murder of 23-year-old Welsh backpacker Kirsty Jones in 2000 was blamed on an ethnic guide from Myanmar who was beaten by police in an attempt to coerce a confession.

Despite a number of arrests, no charges have ever been brought over her death.

Displayed: The DNA from Saw (left) and Win (right) - who are said to have confessed to murdering two British backpackers in Thailand - matches that collected from the victims' bodies, local police said

Accused: Following their reputed confession, the two men Win (left) and Saw (right) were presented at a news conference on the popular tourist island this morning

The two Burmese bar workers said to have confessed to murdering Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were caught on CCTV riding a moped on Koh Tao on the night of the killing. It is not known which of the three they are

Tragic: Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old Miss Witheridge, who hailed from Great Yarmouth, in the early hours of September 15
