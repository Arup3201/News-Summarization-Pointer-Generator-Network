Virtual currencies like bitcoin are 
to be taxed in the United States like property rather than currency, the
 Internal Revenue Service has said.

The IRS said bitcoin is not legal tender and that it cannot be used to pay taxes.

However, those whose wages are paid in bitcoin have to pay taxes as they would if paid directly in dollars.

The IRS issued a series of 16 questions and answers on Tuesday to clarify the tax treatment of virtual currencies like bitcoin.

In general, the IRS said it will apply the same rules that govern other barter transactions.

If you receive wages in bitcoin, they would be taxed at their fair market value at the time you were paid, the IRS said.

If
 you use bitcoins to pay for goods or services, the vendor must report 
the income, using the fair market value of the bitcoins at the time of 
the transaction.

For investors, bitcoins will be treated like other commodities, the IRS said. 
If they increase in value, you have to pay capital gains taxes after you
 sell them. If they lose value, you can recognise a capital loss.

Created
 in 2009, bitcoin is an online currency that allows people to make 
one-to-one transactions, buy goods and services and exchange money 
across borders without involving banks or other third parties.

In February, Tokyo-based MtGox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, filed for bankruptcy

Bitcoins have become popular with libertarians, technology enthusiasts and speculators.

Regulators worry about criminals using them to avoid detection.

In February, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, MtGox, based in Tokyo, filed for bankruptcy, adding to mistrust of the currency.

Supporters say problems at the exchange were isolated.
