Sister wives disguised as ninjas tried to break into the home of a 14-year-old girl who was due to testify at their shared husband's rape trial, police have said.

Raven Blackwing, 22, and Tylynn Southwick, 19, armed themselves with a knife, cellophane, matches, a screwdriver, syringes and Formalin - a chemical used to knock people out - before allegedly breaking into the girl's home in West Jordan, Utah, on Friday morning.

But the two women, who say they share the same husband, were stopped by a man staying at the home when he heard the upstairs floor creaking just before 4am, the Deseret News reported.

When he went to investigate, he came across two people dressed all in black who lunged at him and tried to grab his throat, according to charging documents.

'I heard a creak, and there was silence for about 30 seconds,' he told FOX News 13.

'I went to the bottom of the stairs and saw a couple of ninjas coming down. They were all dark gray or black, and they had black rubber gloves on and masks. All I could see was their eyes.'

He added: 'My adrenaline was pumping so bad. They grabbed for me and one of them covered my mouth, and the other grabbed my throat, but they were both pretty small so I threw them back and started shouting to get anybody awake that I could.'

Another man in the home heard the noise and went to help, but Southwick allegedly went for him with a stun gun. He was able to wrestle her and pinned her down until police arrived.

When cops reached the home, they also found one of the men holding Blackwing back with a samurai sword on the couch, according to the charges.

The 14-year-old girl, who was asleep at the time, was set to testify against their shared husband, 45-year-old Kain Blackwing, just four days after the attack. Blackwing was charged with rape in July. 

Police in Utah say the attack happened near this junction in West Jordan shortly after 4am on Friday 

Despite his wives' alleged attempts to reach the girl, his preliminary hearing went ahead on Tuesday and he will be back in court in November.

Records show he was also convicted of aggravated assault in 2005 and sex activity with a minor in 2010. His rap sheet also shows accusations of harboring a runaway in 2008.

The two women were each charged with aggravated burglary, retaliation against a witness or victim and aggravated assault. Bail was set at $1 million cash for each.

Both women claim to be married to Blackwing, although Raven Blackwing is listed as his wife in court documents, while Southwick is called his girlfriend. 

Police do not believe the trio belong to a polygamist church.
