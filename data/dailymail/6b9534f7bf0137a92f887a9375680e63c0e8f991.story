More than 100 patients of a millionaire dentist accused of putting lives at risk from HIV or hepatitis by failing to sterilise equipment are planning to sue him – and could receive payouts of up to £20,000.

Their lawyers say Desmond D’Mello, 60, ran an ‘NHS dental factory’, seeing so many patients to boost his earnings that some had shoddy treatment including undiagnosed gum disease and botched surgery.

D’Mello was suspended in June after he was filmed breaking hygiene rules at his Nottinghamshire practice. In three days, he saw 166 patients – 40 in one morning.

Dentist Desmond D'Mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his Nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period

Health chiefs have urged 22,000 patients to be tested for blood diseases. Police are already investigating the death of Amy Duffield, 23, days after he gave her a check-up.

Chris Dean, of the Dental Law Partnership, which is handling the claims, said: ‘It’s inconceivable that you could see 166 patients over a three-day period and give them all a reasonably satisfactory service.’

The Dental Defence Union, which operates D’Mello’s indemnity scheme, said last night the dentist could not comment because of patient confidentiality.

A spokesman for NHS England said all 166 patients filmed being treated by Mr D'Mello have been contacted.

It has emerged Mr D'Mello raked in around £1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He sold his Georgian mansion on the outskirts of Nottingham for £1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury Nottingham flat, pictured

He said an alert was sent to GPs and dentists in the area with guidance on how to advise patients who might contact them.

A dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support.

Anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.  

NHS England has also set up a temporary Community Clinic for patients, to provide further advice, counselling, and where necessary blood testing. 

Patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, at the Arnold Health Centre, located at Highcroft Medical Centre on High Street in Arnold, Nottingham. 

Anyone who lives outside the area, or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening. 

That alert was sent to all GP surgeries and dentists across the UK, to ensure patients who have moved away from the Nottingham area can still seek help. 

He added: 'NHS 111 and the NHS Customer Contact Centre have been briefed, as have NHS Choices who have placed information on their website.

'Other NHS organisations, including CCGs and acute trusts, have been notified in order to direct patients to the correct place should they present with concerns.' 

Detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient Amy Duffield is linked to dental treatments she received.

Last week it emerged Mr D'Mello could have earned up to £1,000 a day, fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle.

The 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished Georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars, including a Mercedes, a Porsche and a Ferrari, with personalised number plates. 

The impressive Georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds.

It features seven bedrooms, three reception rooms and a study, garages for three cars, a tennis court, pond, wood, meadow and secret garden.

It is built on land formerly owned by the Seely family, renowned landowners in Nottinghamshire.

He sold the £1.5million grade two listed property, Ramsdale Farm, on the outskirts of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of Nottingham. 

Nottinghamshire Police are making enquiries into the death of Amy Duffield, 23, a patient of Mr D'Mello who died unexpectedly last year

Mr D'Mello worked for 32 years at the Daybrook Dental Practice, pictured, in Mansfield Road, Nottingham. NHS bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership
