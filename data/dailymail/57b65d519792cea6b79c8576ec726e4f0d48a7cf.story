It was the grim setting for the murder mystery at the heart of ITV’s crime thriller Broadchurch.

But in a macabre echo of the ITV series, a dead man has been found at the foot of the same cliffs that featured in the programme and police are now investigating.

The award-winning programme’s plot centred on a police investigation after an 11-year-old’s body was found on a fictional beach in mysterious circumstances.

But locals were left stunned when reality appeared to mirror fiction with the discovery of the middle-aged man’s body yesterday morning.

West Bay beach in Dorset, where the programme was partly shot in 2012, was yesterday closed and a tent erected around the scene as dozens of police officers investigated the area.

Police have yet not yet revealed whether the death is being treated as suspicious, with investigators examining whether the male died while climbing.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said that the body had injuries consistent with a fall from a considerable height.

‘The discovery was made at about 7.45am and an investigation into what happened to the man is underway,’ said the spokesman.

Detective Sergeant Steve Broadhurst said: ‘While we are keeping an open mind all the signs are that this is not suspicious.’

The spokesman said that details of the man’s identity were being withheld until all his relatives had been told of the tragedy.

Broadchurch has won numerous awards and an American version is now being made

The beach, which is  featured in the opening episode of the drama when two police detectives, played by David Tennant and Olivia Coleman, arrive following the death of schoolboy Danny Latimer.

The Mayor of Bridport, a nearby town where parts of the programme were also filmed, said: ’We now need to find out what exactly has happened here.’

‘This is very sad news. I can only say what everyone else has been saying and that it is an awful thing to happen. I feel for the family and send them our condolences.
