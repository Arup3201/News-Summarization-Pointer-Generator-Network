An obese boxing fan who lost eight stone on a year-long fitness camp in Thailand was detained by border guards on his way home because they did not believe he was the same person who had entered the country.

Ross Connor, 33, slimmed down from 21 stone to 13 stone after he enrolled at a Muay Thai kickboxing gym in Phuket.

But he hit problems when he tried to leave the country, with border guards detaining him for questioning, convinced he could not be the same person they photographed on his arrival 12 months earlier.

Fighting fit: Ross Connor lost eight stone while on a year long training camp in Thailand

Training regime: Mr Connor paid £6,000 to enrol at the year-long kickboxing camp on the island of Phuket

Mr Connor only managed to negotiate his way on to a flight home after showing photographs on his iPod documenting his dramatic weight loss.

Mr Connor, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said: 'It was a worrying moment.

'I knew I’d lost a lot of weight, but I never expected they wouldn’t let me on the plane.

'But when they showed me the image taken on my arrival, even I had trouble recognising myself.

'After all my hard work, I thought I wasn’t going to get home to show my family the result of my year of training.'

Boxing fan Mr Connor decided to take action in March last year after he put on so much weight he was having trouble walking and said he sounded like Darth Vader when he breathed.

Kickboxer: For 12 months Mr Connor worked out four hours a day in the heat and humidity of Phuket

He paid £6,000 to enrol at the year-long kickboxing camp on the island of Phuket.

For 12 months Mr Connor worked out four hours a day in the heat and humidity.

He said: 'I’d watch my idols boxing, and I thought to myself, if they can lose weight at a boxing camp before a fight - then so can I.

'I’d comfort eaten my way to obesity in such a short time and doctors told me if I carried on I wasn’t going to see 40.

'I thought I was in control, but before I knew it I was 21 stone and eating my way to an early grave.

Slimmed down: Mr Connor said he was not strict with his diet during the year-long fitness camp, adding: 'I ate what I wanted - but the training regime was brutal'

'I ate takeaways every night and never exercised. I avoided meeting friends, and talking to girls. Getting a date was just unrealistic, so I just stopped caring.'

Speaking of his year-long slog, he said: 'I wasn’t strict with my diet - I ate what I wanted - but the training regime was brutal.

'I was ultimately living in a gym and training 24/7.

'It wasn’t a fat camp. People came to get authentic Muay Thai training, so they were quite fit.

'I was the fattest one there, bottom of the class, so I had to work twice as hard to heave my 21 stone around the ring.'

Delighted: Mr Connor said he is delighted with his new look and plans to return to the Thai gym in June to put in another six months of training

When Mr Connor entered Thailand his photograph was snapped and border guards also took a biometric image.

Guards did not believe he was the same person until he showed them a diary of photographs from his camp.

When they realised their mistake, they congratulated him and sent him on his way.

Mr Connor said he is delighted with his new look and plans to return to the Thai gym in June to put in another six months of training.

He said: 'I couldn’t be happier with the way it all worked out.'
