When Glaswegian rockers Texas took a breather after their seventh album in 2005, singer Sharleen Spiteri thought they might be out of action for a couple of years before resuming a career that had seen them sell more than 30 million albums.

She hadn’t expected the eight-year hiatus that followed, punctuated by personal upheaval, a change of record label and two solo albums. Only now, as the band finally return with new album The Conversation, does she feel ready to reflect.

‘We didn’t intend to take such a long break,’ she tells me over coffee near her London home in Primrose Hill. ‘But we needed to get away.  People were getting blasé about Texas, because we’d be on the radio all the time. I did two solo albums, but I didn’t mean to make them at the expense of the band.’ 

Sharleen Spiteri said the band did not intend to take 'such a long break' when they took a breather following their seventh album in 2005. She is pictured right at the 2013 Ivor Novello awards held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, earlier this month

Her first solo effort, Melody in 2008, was meant for Texas. But Sharleen felt her songs were too personal, as she wrote them after a painful split from former boyfriend Ashley Heath, father of her daughter Misty, now ten.

‘I didn’t have the patience to discuss guitar solos with the group,’ she says. ‘They are like brothers to me, but there were never any big discussions about my life.’ Another solo record, The Movie Songbook, a collection of film themes made with late producer Phil Ramone, came two years later.

But Texas had been struck in 2009, when guitarist Ally McErlaine suffered a brain aneurysm and was in a coma for nine weeks afterwards.

The band only began work for their new album once he recovered and said he wanted to work again. Sharleen says: ‘I didn’t think we’d make another Texas record. Ally didn’t see music as his true calling. Then, after the aneurysm, he realised he wanted to play guitar again.’ 

The band's new album The Conversation sees a shift from pop and R&B to the guitar-driven rock of their formative years

The Conversation sees a shift from pop and R&B to the guitar-driven rock of the band’s formative years, when former hairdresser Sharleen became a Telecaster-toting poster girl with hits such as I Don’t Want A Lover in 1989.

Sharleen is now in a relationship with Welsh TV chef Bryn Williams, and her inspiration comes from heartfelt chats with friends — hence the album title.

‘I’m in a happy relationship and on good terms with my ex, too. I can tell my friends that things do get better. It’s the same with the band. When we started, I couldn’t see us lasting ten years, but we’re still going strong after 25.’
