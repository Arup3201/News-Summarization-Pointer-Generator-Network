News travels quickly in football these days, and rumours travel even quicker. So it was that Twitter declared on Sunday evening that Radamel Falcao had not stayed at Old Trafford to watch Manchester United lose to Southampton after being excluded from Louis van Gaal’s squad.

As it happened, that was quite wrong. Falcao watched with United defender Marcos Rojo from a private box and then mingled in the players’ tunnel at full-time. Another social media whirlwind becalmed by some rather less exciting truths.

Nevertheless, the issue of where Falcao will be next season, rather than where he was on Sunday, remains increasingly pertinent. Certainly, you wouldn’t put any decent amount of money on the £280,000-a-week loanee being retained as things stand.

Radamel Falcao has struggled at Man United and there are doubts the striker will remain at Old Trafford

The Manchester United loanee has scored just three goals in eight starts having joined the club from Monaco

The bald statistics of the Colombian’s stay at United so far read: Played (started) 8; Scored: 3.

With half the season gone already, both of those numbers are going to have to shoot skywards if United’s executives are going to press the button on a permanent deal with Monaco that stands to cost them in excess of £40million in transfer fee alone this summer.

Certainly United manager Van Gaal has his own doubts about the 28-year-old, doubts that he harboured long before he chose to remove him from his squad of 18 after his players’ final training session at Carrington on Saturday.

Sportsmail revealed back at the start of winter that Van Gaal was already wondering about the South Americans’ physical durability and, despite a recent return to action after some muscle issues, those reservations remain.

604 - Minutes played for United so far

3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions

201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33

£40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages

£1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages)

The Premier League is increasingly a young man’s playground, especially for those who want to play No 9. Falcao, sadly, suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last season — the one players fear above all others - and that was always going to plant seeds of doubt in the mind of a coach who, despite his love of attractive, passing football, is pretty much obsessed with the issue of players’ fitness.

For his part, Falcao feels a little hard done by. It is not in his nature to complain publicly. He knows he has been given a golden opportunity by one of the world’s biggest clubs when others were put off by the numbers and hasn’t given up on life here by any stretch.

It is understood, though, that the former Atletico Madrid forward feels that he has to do twice as much to impress Van Gaal than some others in the United set-up.

Only recently Falcao was left bemused by Van Gaal’s continued assertions that he wouldn’t pick him ‘until he is fit….first he needs to be fit’. As far as he was concerned, he had recovered from the calf injury that side lined him just as he seemed to be getting his United career off the ground and just couldn’t understand why his manager was making such noises.

On a daily basis, Falcao has done what he needs to do, and then some. Those who know him told of a player desperate to impress his manager, desperate to learn to English football quickly and who has stayed behind for solitary training sessions on a number of occasions in a bid to prepare and acclimatise his body.

Falcao has understood quickly that centre forwards in England must do more than score goals. He has seen the way Wayne Rooney plays his football - the areas of the field that he occupies - and has endeavoured to move his own game in that direction.

It is difficult, though, if you are not allowed to ease yourself in to the ebb and flow of regular football.

‘The manager talks rhythm and confidence but it’s hard to establish either if you are in and out of the team,’ said an associate of Falcao on Monday. ‘This is part of the problem for Falcao.

‘He desperately feels he needs games in order for people to see the best of him.

‘That is why he was so stunned to be left out of the squad for Sunday.’

Van Gaal’s history as a coach tells that he can be merciless when it comes to his treatment of his players. It is accepted as a quality. At Barcelona first time round, for example, he shunted the great Brazilian Rivaldo - the darling of the Nou Camp - out on to the wing and when he complained he dropped him.

Known as an obsessive keeper of figures, one key component of Van Gaal’s famous dossiers is, for centre forwards, not just goals but shots on target and assists. If those numbers don’t keep heading north at the required rate then you are in trouble, whoever you are.

Certainly at Old Trafford, Falcao is part of a wider problem.

Van Gaal’s squad needs a regular goal scorer if it is to go anywhere at all next season. Rooney no longer counts as he plays a withdrawn role while Robin van Persie will be 32 in August and looks short these days when compared to Diego Costa at Chelsea, Sergio Aguero at Manchester City and Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez.

Van Gaal and his club need the next Ruud van Nistelrooy and if it’s not going to be Falcao then he increasingly looks like being the obvious one to make way.
