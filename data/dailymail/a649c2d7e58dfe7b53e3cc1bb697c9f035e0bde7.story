Vaclav Havel, pictured in 2005, died at his weekend this morning, according to his assistant

Vaclav Havel, who became the first Czech president after leading the bloodless Velvet Revolution against communist rule, died yesterday aged 75.

The dissident playwright was instrumental in opening the door to democracy in Eastern Europe by loosening the Soviet grip.

Tributes flooded in from world leaders who hailed him as ‘the greatest European of our age’.

Havel was invited by Margaret Thatcher to 10 Downing Street  during his first official visit to the UK after the collapse of communism in 1989.

As well as steering his country towards freedom, he also oversaw the peaceful 1993 split of Czechoslovakia into two separate countries – the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

David Cameron said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death.

‘Havel devoted his life to the cause of human freedom,’ said the Prime Minister.

‘For years, communism tried to crush him and to extinguish his voice. But Havel, the playwright and the dissident, could not be silenced.

‘No one of my generation will ever forget those powerful scenes from Wenceslas Square two decades ago. Havel led the Czech people out of tyranny. And he helped bring freedom and democracy to our entire continent.

‘Europe owes Vaclav Havel a profound debt. Today his voice has fallen silent. But his example and the cause to which he devoted his life will live on.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘Cold War hero, playwright and president. He opened the door to democracy in Eastern Europe and will always be remembered.’

He added: ‘He played a pivotal role in the development of freedom in Europe.’Havel never won the Nobel Peace prize despite being nominated several times for the honour.

But he was bestowed with America’s highest civilian award by then President George W. Bush who called him ‘one of liberty’s great heroes’.

The former chain smoker, who survived several operations for lung cancer and a burst intestine that nearly killed him, died at his country home north-east of the Czech capital Prague.

He had a history of chronic respiratory problems dating back to his years locked in dank communist prisons. In recent public appearances recently he appeared thin and drawn.

Born in 1936 to a wealthy family  in Czechoslovakia, he began co-writing plays during his military service in the 1950s. His first  solo play, The Garden Party, was staged in 1963.

A lover of jazz and theatre he famously ridiculed the communist state as ‘Absurdistan’. His revolutionary motto was: ‘Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred.’

But his works were banned after the 1968 uprising was crushed by a Soviet invasion when tanks rolled into Wenceslas Square.
