Two sisters without driving licences led police on a 90mph car chase before asking officers for a cigarette when they were finally flagged down.

Police initially tried to stop Amy Humpage, 25, as she drove her sister, Laura, 27, in a BMW near their home in Castle Vale, Birmingham, but she shut the car window on an officer's thumb and sped off, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

Then ensued a high speed chase - during which the sisters swapped seats - which only ended when they crashed the car in Aston, a court was told.

During the chase the sisters shook off two police cars but were caught by a third when they crashed into a wall

Officers told the court that Amy Humpage had 'clearly been drinking' when they flagged her white BMW 118 cabriolet down early one morning last month.

They said they then gave chase after she closed the car window on an officer's thumb but the first police car was shaken off.

By the time a second patrol car caught up with the BMW Laura Humpage was at the wheel, speeding along Fort Parkway in the city at 70mph.

Miss Humpage drove on the wrong side of the road, jumped three red lights, turned right blindly and almost lost control as she sped around a roundabout near Spaghetti Junction, but she managed to shake off two police cars in the chase.

A third car caught up with them as they crashed the car into a wall, demolishing it, at around 7am on September 7.

The sisters then refused to get out of the vehicle when officers asked them to, so police smashed the window with a baton.

When Laura Humpage, pictured, and her sister were eventually stopped by police, they asked for a cigarette

Alistair Redford, prosecuting, said: 'When the car was stopped Laura handed the keys over and asked officers for a cigarette. 

'Amy was clearly drunk but failed to provide a specimen.'

The older of the two was breath-tested and was found to be under the drink-drive limit but had alcohol in her system.

Both sisters were arrested at the scene and appeared in court yesterday.

Laura Humpage, who has a one-year-old son, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance and a licence.

The court heard she had suffered mental health problems and had been sectioned in the past. She was handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a supervision order.

Her younger sister admitted careless driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no licence, and was given a two-month suspended sentence and ordered to pay £250.

Both sisters were also banned from driving.
