Looking calm and organised, these dramatic CCTV images show the man suspected of murdering pretty teenager Georgia Williams just hours before he was arrested by detectives.

Jamie Reynolds, 22, is pictured at his step-father's silver Toyota van in a Glasgow city centre car park.

The shop worker -  who was yesterday charged with the murder of his 17-year-old friend - had earlier completed the 280-mile journey from the Shropshire town where he and Georgia lived.

This video footage was taken from security cameras at 3.20pm on Tuesday - two days after the former head girl - from Wellington, 
Shropshire - told friends she was going to do a modelling-style photoshoot with Reynolds.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

On camera: This CCTV footage shows Jamie Reynolds in a Glasgow city centre car park just 12 hours before he was arrested by police. After 
struggling to park in the space, the car park owner reversed the van for him

Footage: Reynolds - who was yesterday charged with murdering pretty teenager Georgia Williams - moves to the side of his van to start organising through some items

Suspect: The 22-year-old can be seen organising himself at his step-father's silver Toyota van in a Glasgow city centre car park. He had earlier needed help in parking it

Getting ready: As another motorist heads to his car in a neighboring bay, Reynolds slides open the rear door of his van

She was not seen again by her family and friends.

These CCTV images, as reported by The Sun, show Reynolds struggling to park his van, needing help from the car park owner to park. At one point he is pictured looking on as the large vehicle is driven into a space.

Dressed in grey jeans, a blue T-shirt and trainers, he is then pictured opening the passenger side door as well as the rear door.

He begins transferring items - including what appears to be a large bag - into the rear of the van.

Calmly, he then sprays underneath his arms with deodorant before removing his T-shirt and replacing it with a white top.

Sprucing up: After appearing to move some items - including a large bag - into the rear of the van, the shop worker then sprays himself with some deodorant

Change: He then takes off his T-shirt and finds a new piece of clothing to wear

New look: Reynolds puts on a white T-shirt and grabs a bag before locking up the van

Held: Reynolds can then be seen heading towards the car park exit. Just 12 hours after this image was taken, he was arrested by police officers at a budget hotel

He then grabs a shoulder bag, locks up the van and walks out of the car park in Glasgow's Dunblane Street.

But at 4am the following day, Reynolds was arrested at the budget Premier Inn hotel just two minutes from the car park.

Yesterday, police revealed they had charged Reynolds with the murder of Miss Williams.

Officers confirmed that the body of a young female, who has not been formally identified, has been found near Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham, and they believe that it is linked to the disappearance of the former head girl.

The 17-year-old, from Wellington, 
Shropshire, has not been seen since telling her parents she was going to
see friends on Sunday evening.

Police said new evidence came to light which proved that she had died at an address in Wellington.

Reynolds will now appear before Telford Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

Court appearance: Georgia Williams pictured with Jamie Reynolds who was charged with her murder yesterday and will appear before magistrates tomorrow

Missing: Teenager Georgia Williams went missing on Sunday after telling her parents that she was going to see friends

Murder charge: Reynolds, 22, of Telford, had initially been held on suspicion of kidnap but was charged with murder yesterday

Investigation: The suspect's vehicle is taken away by police officers from a car park in Glasgow city centre

In a press conference yesterday afternoon 
Superintendent Nav Malik said: 'During our enquiries, sadly, late 
yesterday afternoon new evidence came to light that proved Georgia was 
deceased and that she died at an address in Wellington.

'For obvious legal reasons, 
particularly to ensure that future court proceedings are not 
jeopardised, we are not able to reveal further information about this 
evidence at this time.

'However, I can now confirm that the 
body of a female was found earlier this afternoon - at around 2pm - in 
woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham.

'The body has not yet been formally 
identified but early indications suggest that the discovery relates to 
our investigation into the disappearance of Georgia Williams.'

Search: Police launched a widespread hunt for Georgia, 17, (centre) after she disappeared on Sunday after telling parents she was visiting friends

Grim discovery: The body of a young girl found by police yesterday afternoon has not yet been formally identified, but detectives are linking it to Georgia's disappearance

Devastated: Missing Georgia's family have been informed of the developments in the police search for her

Vehicle: Police said the man was driving a silver Toyota Hiace 300 GS van (pictured), registration CX06 ASV

The former head girl is believed to have been going to the
home of Jamie Reynolds for a modelling-style photoshoot.

The 22-year-old was initially 
arrested on suspicion of kidnapping but detectives yesterday revealed he had been charged with murder.

West
Mercia Police had said that detectives from North Wales Police were 
searching an area of land on the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham.

Friends of Georgia had spoken of their distress at the search for the 17-year-old as they joined in the hunt for the teenager.

Katy Lafferty, who is Georgia's best 
friend said the last time they 
spoke she was 'her usual self', adding her disappearance was 
'heart-breaking'.

Frantic: More than 50 friends of Georgia had gathered in her home town to distribute posters and comfort each other over her disappearance

Heartbreaking: Friends of Georgia Williams console each other at All Saints Church, Wellington, Shropshire as they joined in the search for the teenager

'I last spoke to her Saturday and she was just the same as she's always been - I didn't really suspect anything,' she said.

She had added: 'I have faith in her, I believe in her.'

The 17-year-old praised the support that had been expressed by thousands of people via social media.

Asked
how she was coping with the disappearance of her friend she said: 'It's
difficult but you've got to believe in her and get through.

'You've got to believe that she's somewhere and is going to come back.'

She said she had spoken with Georgia's parents Lynette, 51, and DC Stephen Williams, 56, and said they were 'just getting through it - how else can you be?'

Helping police: Two of Georgia William's friends hand out missing person leaflets to passers by in Wellington, Shropshire

Public search: Three year old Ruby Lowe ties ribbons onto a board publicising the search for Georgia at The Plough Inn, Wellington, Shropshire

Police had sealed off woodland close to the home of the teenager after 'clothing was discovered' at the site.

But yesterday Inspector Richard Langton, from the Wellington safer 
neighbourhood team, said detectives had now ruled out any connection 
with Georgia’s disappearance to the police cordon around an area of 
woodland at Brown Moss Nature Reserve, 17 miles away from Wellington, 
yesterday.

He said: 'That was an important piece of work.

'Thankfully,
we’ve been able to eliminate that from this inquiry which means we can 
concentrate those resources and those members of staff on other 
searches.'

He added the force had had a 'tremendous' response from the public following the TV appeal.

Hunt: A police car can be seen in the woodland at Brown Moss near Whitchurch, Shropshire, as officers hunt for Georgia Williams

Looking for clues: Police cordon off a wooded spot in Whitchurch, Shropshire, during the search

Superintendent Nav Malik, Telford and Wrekin police commander, said yesterday: 'I make it very clear, folks, that we have not found Georgia Williams at this moment in time.

'She remains elsewhere - we are not quite sure where.

'We are really, really keen to identify where she may be, her whereabouts and I urge the public to support us in trying to find out where she may be.'

He added there were more than 50 detectives working on the investigation.

Map: Detectives believed Georgia had travelled from Wellington to Oswestry, Rhyll, Chester, Cumbria and Glasgow

Investigation: Another emergency vehicle can be seen through thick trees in the woodland spot where officers were hunting for the missing student

Murder investigation: Police began searching at the woodland spot
