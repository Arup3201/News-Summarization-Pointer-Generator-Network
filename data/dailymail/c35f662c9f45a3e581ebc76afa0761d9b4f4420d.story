Nobel Peace Prize laureate
and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel is lending his support to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's March 3 speech to
Congress on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.

Outspoken New Jersey Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach said on Thursday he is placing full-page advertisements in two leading U.S. newspapers, The New York Times and The
Washington Post, featuring Wiesel's endorsement of Netanyahu's
speech.

The advertisement quotes Wiesel as saying he plans to attend Netanyahu's address 'on the catastrophic danger of a nuclear Iran,' with the author asking Obama and lawmakers: 'Will you join me in hearing the case for keeping weapons from those who preach death to Israel and America?'

The high-profile ad campaign puts pressure on the White House and congressional Democrats to rethink their plans to skip the address.

Elie Wiesel, a Jewish-American writer, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Holocaust survivor, is weighing in on the split in Congress over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's March 3 speech

Outspoken New Jersey Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach  is placing full-page advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post featuring Wiesel's endorsement of Netanyahu's speech. The ad quotes Wiesel as saying he plans to attend Netanyahu's address 'on the catastrophic danger of a nuclear Iran,' and asks Obama and lawmakers to join him in 'hearing the case for keeping weapons from those who preach death to Israel and America'

Speaking to Reuters by phone, Boteach said: 'There's no
personality more respected in the global Jewish community and
few in the wider world than Elie Wiesel. He is a living prince
of the Jewish people.'

'He is the face of the murdered 6 million (Jews killed in
the Holocaust). So I think that his view on the prime minister's
speech sounding the alarm as to the Iranian nuclear program
carries a unique authority that transcends some of the political
circus that has affected the speech,' Boteach said.

Boteach, the author of books including 'Kosher Sex,' was the
Republican nominee in 2012 for a seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives but lost to Democratic incumbent Bill Pascrell. 

Wiesel, 86, who has written extensively of his imprisonment
in Nazi camps and was awarded the Nobel in 1986, is the latest to join a fray that has exposed
deep divisions among American Jews over the policy and propriety
behind a speech in which Netanyahu is expected to criticize
Obama's effort to forge an international nuclear deal with Iran.

'Should we not show our support for what might be the last clear warning before a terrible deal is struck?' he asks in the ad. 'As one who has seen the enemies of the Jewish people make good on threats to exterminate us, how can I remain silent?'

John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of
Representatives, invited Netanyahu to appear before Congress. Neither Boehner nor Netanyahu consulted the White House before scheduling the visit.

Detractors say Netanyahu,
who has long warned the West of the dangers of a nuclear-armed
Iran, is working with Republicans to thumb their noses at Obama,
a Democrat. 

Some of Netanyahu's critics accuse him of placing ties to Republicans above Israel's relations with the United States, its most important ally. U.S.-born Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to Washington, is a former Republican political operative. 

This week J Street, a Democratic-leaning pro-Israel group,
started a petition drive opposed to the Israeli leader's speech.

J Street said it had gathered more than 20,000 signatures for a petition asking Jews to say 'Bibi does NOT speak for me,' using Netanyahu's nickname, in response to Netanyahu calling himself not just Israel's prime minister but also 'a representative of the entire Jewish people.' 

Prominent Jewish leader Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation
League denounced that effort as 'inflammatory and repugnant.' 

Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street, said American Jews
had long been divided, with Republican Jews backing Netanyahu's
right-wing government and liberal Jews more in line with the
Israeli opposition.

'Perhaps the biggest mistake the prime minister has made is
allowing his speech to be the wedge that has driven that
argument more public,' Ben-Ami said.

He said about 70 percent of Jewish Americans vote Democratic
and roughly a quarter identifies as Republican.

'But today, with a really divided society on both sides of
the ocean, both there and here, it isn't possible any longer for
there to be a single voice representing the views of all Jewish
Americans,' Ben-Ami said.

The Republican Jewish Coalition lobbying group launched a petition countering J Street's campaign, titled 'Stand with Bibi,' and has promised to publicize which U.S. lawmakers boycott the speech. 

More than a dozen Democratic lawmakers have also excused themselves from the remarks, including Jewish Rep. John Yarmuth, who said in a statement, 'We know what he is going to say.' 

Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the most senior U.S.senator, said this week he would not attend Netanyahu's speech either and accused Republicans of orchestrating what he called 'a tawdry and high-handed stunt that has embarrassed not only Israel but the Congress itself.' 

Matt Brooks, the Republican Jewish Coalition's executive
director, countered: 'It's important for the Jewish community to
know that members of Congress have a choice ... whether they're
going to stand with the prime minister of Israel and the Jewish
community in opposition to a nuclear Iran, or whether they're
going to put partisan politics ahead of that and stand with
President Obama.'

Not only will the White House not participate in Netanyahu's address to Congress, it won't entertain him at all while he is in Washington that week.

Vice President Joe Biden's office has said the VP will be in Central America at the time of Netanyahu's visit and will therefore be unable to preside over the Senate that day. 

President Barack Obama has said he won't meet with Netanyahu during his trip to Washington as he feels it would be 'inappropriate' with an election in Israel around the corner.
