Gliding confidently beneath the ripples, this baby boy has taken to swimming like a duck to water.

And it may have saved his life – regular dips since he was just seven weeks old helped William Jones build up enough strength to survive open heart surgery.

Here he is at 15 weeks, enjoying a swim just two days before being admitted to the paediatric cardiac unit at Southampton General Hospital where he had surgery to repair a hole in his heart.

William, who has Down’s syndrome, was taken swimming by his parents, Susan, 41, a teacher, and Andrew, 39, a warrant officer in the Army, who wanted him to be strong enough to cope with the operation.

A little superman: After just a few sessions in the swimming pool William's parents notices his muscles developing 

And he was. After the surgery, William battled complications – at one point suffering a cardiac arrest and needing 45 minutes of CPR.

But after four months recovering, he is well enough to be back at home with his family in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

Yesterday, Mrs Jones said: ‘He is definitely my little superman.

'The swimming has helped improve his muscle tone and gain strength in preparation for cardiac surgery. 

'The first time we took William to the pool he stretched back and floated happily. He really seems to love being in the water.

‘With Down’s syndrome, muscle is quite weak but after just a couple of sessions in the pool we noticed his muscles were developing.’ 

Before surgery William had eight lessons in a hydrotherapy pool organised by baby swimming teachers Aquatots. 

And now he is growing stronger, his mum can’t wait to see him paddling again. 

‘We are very keen to get him back in the pool as soon as possible because it is really going to help with his development,’ she said.

Recovery: William spent four months in Southampton General Hospital after having the operation. His parents Susan and Andrew have since taken him home

All better: The baby recovered so well his parents were able to take him home recently. They credited his regular swimming with him being able to withstand the trauma on his tiny body
