Dan Greaves struck Commonwealth gold for England with victory in the F42/44 discus at a noisy Hampden Park on Monday.

The 31-year-old, who took silver at London 2012, came out on top of his domestic duel with Wales' Aled Davies, winning with a throw of 59.21 metres.

That converted to 1023 points in the mixed-classification event, with Davies (46.83m, 1012 points) taking the silver.

Champion: Dan Greaves won gold for England in the F42/44 discus on Monday

Greaves admitted success in Glasgow trumped his London podium finish, saying: 'This surpasses everything in the last couple of years.

'To get the first gold of England's campaign in track and field is such an honour.

'It has been a long year and this is the cherry on the top. This is my first multi-sport able-bodied Games, and it feels so good to come away with something I've worked so hard for.'

The Leicestershire athlete took Paralympic gold 10 years ago in Athens and, asked how this one compared, he said: 'Athens is a long time ago. Your first Paralympic gold is unforgettable. I broke the world record with that gold.

'I've got a picture on my phone of the gold medal. Whenever I look at my phone it's there, a reminder of what I won, and that's what kept me motivated throughout the year.'
