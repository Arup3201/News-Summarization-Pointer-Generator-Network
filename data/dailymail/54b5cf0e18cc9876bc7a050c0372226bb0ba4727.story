Joel Campbell has been pictured for the first time training with the Arsenal squad.

The 22-year-old got a taste of the action with the squad in Austria, where the club are holding a four day training camp before returning to host the Emirates Cup at the weekend, in which they play Benfica and Monaco.

Campbell impressed last season on loan at Greek champions Olympiacos, scoring eleven goals including a fabulous curling strike in a 2-0 first-leg victory over Manchester United in the last 16 of the Champions League.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Calum Chambers sing the Kooks to his new team-mates

He also showed his promise at the World Cup with Costa Rica, hitting the net against Uruguay and becoming an integral part of a side which unexpectedly reached the Quarter Finals before penalty shootout anguish against Holland.

The left-footed forward’s future at Arsenal remains unclear. With competition from the likes of Olivier Giroud and Yaya Sanogo, as well as the arrival of the dynamic Alexis Sanchez, he could find his first-team opportunities limited at the club.

Skills: Campbell will be hoping to show off his extensive skill set for Arsenal this campaign

An alternative would be for Campbell to be loaned for the fifth time in as many seasons. Several Premier League clubs including Southampton and West Ham are reported to be interested should the Gunners’ decide Campbell needs to play his football elsewhere next season.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has not given any definitive answers on the Costa Rican’s immediate future. The Frenchman has said simply 'He will definitely come back to us for pre-season,' before adding 'He is maturing well.'
