For Bill Turnbull his usual presenting slot involves discussing the current news issues of the day on the BBC Breakfast sofa.

But the 58-year-old seemed to take a lighter approach as he began an innuendo-filled exchange with Carol Kirkwood when he told her there seemed to be 'a lot of interest' in her isobars, as she presented the weather.

The married journalist appeared to turn on the flirtatious charm as he then asked the weather presenter, dressed in a figure-hugging red dress, if her isobars were 'tightly packed.'

Bill Turnbull told Carol Kirkwood, the weather presenter, that her isobars had attracted 'a lot of interest' as the pair appeared to engage in an innuendo-laden exchange live on air on Tuesday morning

She then seemed to indulge Turnbull, as she responded giggling and told him they were 'getting a good squeeze.'

The 52-year-old had been presenting the weather on Tuesday and asked viewers to take note of the isobars on the weather map, which indicated unseasonably mild temperatures are on the way. 

Turnbull said to Ms Kirkwood: 'There’s a lot of interest in your isobars this morning.'

He added: 'Are they tightly packed?'

Ms Kirkwood replied that the isobars were 'getting a good squeeze.'

As the pair engaged in the exchange Turnbull's co-presenter, Louise Minchin, appeared to laugh uncomfortably as she sat on the BBC Breakfast sofa next to him. 

Turnbull, who is married with three children, then continued in the light-hearted tone as he asked Ms Kirkwood when they would see her appear on Strictly Come Dancing.

She quickly responded that this would not be happening soon, and said she has 'two left feet.' 

Turnbull said this would not make her the first, referring to his own appearance on the show in 2005.

The exchange on Tuesday morning led to a number of comments on Twitter, praising the weather presenter's appearance.

Others also noted the  innuendo-ridden conversation between the pair.

The BBC declined to comment on the exchange between the two presenters.

Ms Kirkwood and Turnbull are no stranger to descending into laughter during her live broadcasts.

In February she informed viewers that temperatures of 99 degrees were on the way, with her map annotated with 'Town name.'

As she attempted to stand in front of the offending map to shield the error from viewers, Turnbull joked: 'I've heard of scorchio, but that's ridiculous.' Both Turnbull and his former co-presenter Susanna Reid descended into laughter and Ms Kirkwood later admitted she had 'clicked her clicker' too many times. 

In June Ms Kirkwood was forced to admit that she had been 'upstaged by a dog' as a labrador crept into the back of the shot, where she was presenting live from a beach in Sussex, and went to the toilet in the sea behind her.

Bill Turnbull teased Ms Kirkwood when she accidentally tapped her clicker, causing the screen to display temperatures of 99 degrees in 'Town name'. Susanna Reid and Turnbull were left giggling on the sofa

Turnbull previously presented the BBC show with Susanna Reid,whose celebrity soared after she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing. 

She moved to ITV earlier this year to front Good Morning Britain.

Reid also drew attention for a wardrobe malfunction as she presented with Turnbull. During a BBC Breakfast slot with Turnbull she moved and showed her underwear beneath her dress.

Last year she also engaged in a flirtatious interview with Alex Turner, frontman of Arctic Monkeys, as she asked him if he would consider appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, leading to a number of comments from viewers. 

Susanna Reid interviewed Alex Turner on BBC Breakfast in 2013, leading viewers to comment on Twitter that the pair appeared to be flirting
