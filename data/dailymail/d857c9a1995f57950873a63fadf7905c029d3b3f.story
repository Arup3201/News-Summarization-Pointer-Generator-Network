Simon Grayson was still basking in the afterglow of Leeds’ famous FA Cup win over Manchester United in 2010 when Sir Alex Ferguson asked him a question.

‘He said to me in his strong Scottish accent “Do you ken pressure?”,’ recalled Grayson of the upset at Old Trafford, the only time Ferguson’s United went out in the third round during his 27 years at the club. ‘I asked him what ken meant and he said, “Do you understand what pressure is?”. I told him as a manager I do.

'"No," he said. "Pressure is to go and get promoted because I backed you at the start of the season!" It was a nice little line from him and I remembered that when we were 1-0 down with 10 men on the last day of the season.’

Leeds did win promotion from League One to the Championship that year and Grayson hopes history is about to repeat itself as he prepares for United’s visit to Preston on Monday night.

Jermaine Beckford, the scorer of the only goal for Leeds that day, has since joined Grayson at Deepdale but is unlikely to play after suffering an ear infection.

But the similarities are obvious for the 45-year-old Preston boss.

‘I still don’t have to buy a drink in Leeds,’ says Grayson. ‘Hopefully it’s an omen that we play United and then get promoted.

‘Our players might never get another opportunity to play against Falcao, Rooney and the like. The one thing I’ll say to them is to have no regrets. They need to wake up the morning after knowing they’ve done themselves justice.’

Veteran striker Kevin Davies has already promised to target United’s soft centre and Grayson believes Louis van Gaal’s side will have their hands full with his 14-goal top-scorer Joe Garner.

He added: ‘Falcao probably earns more in a week than Joe earns in 18 months but he knows where the back of the net is.

‘He’s our talisman. If the United players aren’t aware of him, I’m sure they will be because he ruffles a few feathers.

‘They’ve got everything to lose. If we play to our maximum and they have an off day, the magic of the Cup is there for everyone to see.’

United have still only lost once in 18 games. ‘There are certain things you look at where you think we can cause them problems,’ says Grayson.

‘But you’ve got to look at their front five or six and realise it’s the best you can imagine in world football.

‘They don’t seem to be gelling but what you find with those players is they can produce a bit of magic.

‘One of them can go past four players and smash one in from 35 yards. Our players don’t do that very often.’

This is the first game between the two clubs since they met in the FA Cup 43 years ago and United won 2-0.  

Joe Garner has scored 14 times this season, including a brace against Chesterfield on Tuesday
