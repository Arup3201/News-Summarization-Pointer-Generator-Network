A country estate in the Scottish Highlands with nine homes, its own salmon fishing river and 7,000 acres of land could be yours - if you've got £8million going spare.

The Gledfield estate in Ardgay, near Inverness, lies on the River Carron in a beautiful undisturbed glen with rugged mountains, wooded hillsides and low ground pastureland.

At the heart of the pile is a grand 18th century eight-bedroom manor, which was recently restored after years of neglect, and in currently in the ownership of the Swarovskis, the family behind the crystal company.

The eight-bedroom four-storey Gledfield House lies at the heart of the 7,000 acre Gledfield estate in the village of Ardgay, northern Scotland

The estate, called one of the 'most splendid sporting in the Highlands' by a newspaper, is on the market for £8million

Six lochs within its boundaries have rainbow trout in their waters while 5,000 acres is set aside for deer stalking and another 2,000 for commercial forestry.

The secluded estate in Ardgay, Sutherland, provides lovers of country sports with the chance to complete a sporting Macnab - where a poacher bags a stag, a salmon and a brace of grouse on the same day.

The competition, run by The Field magazine, requires entrants to conduct themselves in a 'sporting and gentlemanly manner' and have signed proof of their successful Macnab challenge from a gillie or gamekeeper.

The estate's sporting credentials have been endorsed by the Daily Telegraph, which called it one of the 'most splendid sporting lodges in the Highlands.'

The estate, which lies on the shores of the Dornoch Firth, along the River Carron, has its own salmon fishing river as well as six lochs full of rainbow trout

The 7,000-acre Gledfield estate, which sits in a secluded glen, has 5,000 acres set aside for deer stalking and country pursuits, with another 2,000 kept for commercial forestry

Gledfield House itself has a sauna and three grand reception rooms, while five of the bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms.

Elsewhere, there are four staff cottages and another four dwellings which can be rented out to holidaymakers eager to enjoy its location on the shores of the Dornoch Firth.

But whoever buys Gledfield will need plenty of money in the bank to run the vast estate.

Evelyn Channing, from agents Savills Rural Services, said: 'It is relatively easy to reach from Inverness Airport and you are surrounded by peace, tranquility and nature.

There are nine properties on the estate, including the grand manor house, staff cottages, and four further cottages that can be rented to holidaymakers

'It is ideal for anyone wanting to get
out of the city. The house is stunning and it is in mint condition with
wonderful gardens.

'There are 4,000 acres for stalking deer, there is fishing on one side of the estate and there is forestry.

'Even
though it is in northern Scotland it is really accessible and there are
no neighbours and no traffic. It is the polar opposite to London.'
