These stunning images may look like beautiful, psychedelic prints, but they are in fact photographs of the colourful interiors of meteorites.

The space rocks are usually known for their dull exterior, but scientist Jeff Barton has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface.

He has photographed hundreds of 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites by using a standard SLR camera and a powerful microscope to zoom in on fragments of the rocks.

Scientist Jeff Barton has created a set of stunning saturated images that look like stained-glass windows, but are actually photographs of wafer thin slices of meteorites

The space rocks are usually known for their dull appearance, but Mr Barton, who is 66 and from Texas, has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface. The above image shows loose crystal grains in dark matrix from a thin section of Vaca Muerta meteorite. The horizontal dimension of this field of view is about 0.085 inches

When viewed from a close-up angle, the crystals inside the 0.5 by 0.9 inch slivers appear as a myriad of colours.

Mr Barton captures the kaleidescope of patterns by attaching a polarising filter to his camera and affixing this to his microscope.

He purchases the miniatures pieces of meteorites from collectors, who painstakingly spend hours cutting, grinding, and polishing them until they are thin enough to use.

Mr Barton has photographed hundreds of thin fragments of meteorites by using a standard digital SLR camera attached to a petrographic microscope. Two polarising filters are required to create a clear image and enhance the colours from the light shining through the slice from underneath

At Vaca Muerta in Chile, many fragments of meteorites were found, including this thin section of a Vaca Muerta meteorite. The left half of the slide, along a diagonal arc from upper left to lower right, is part of a large chondrule that has been melted. Chondrules are small, rounded particles embedded in most stony meteorites

'I began studying thin sections of rocks and meteorites in 2004,' said Mr Barton, 66, from Texas, USA.

'I taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope.

'Now I use a spectrograph and computer software, and I started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites.

'Variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses can alter the polarisation of light passing through the lenses.

'Making the photographs takes a matter of seconds to minutes, depending on how thoroughly you want to document the section and what you are trying to learn from it.'

Mr Barton used variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses to alter the polarisation of light passing through the microscope creating these dazzling colours

Most meteorites, such as the one shown, are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The biggest meteorite that has been found on Earth weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago

'I taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope,' said Mr Barton. 'Now I use a spectrograph and computer software, and I started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites.'

All the meteorites and thin sections were acquired from other collectors, who spend between two and 20 hours making them, depending on the type of material.

'The reactions I get are mostly along the lines of "What is that?" but I quite often get "Wow, those are pretty"', said Mr Barton.

Most meteorites are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

This volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1m to 800km.

The biggest meteorite that has been found on Earth weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago.

It landed in the Otjozondjupa Region of Namibia in Africa and was discovered by the owner of the land in 1920 while he was ploughing.

A piece of a Vaca Muerta meteorite, which are thought to have cooled by about one-half degree per million years. This means they must have been buried deep within a larger piece of rock. This would require an object (like an asteroid) to be between 400km and 800km in diameter

A pair of chondrules from the Allende Meteorite, which fell in 1969 at Pueblito de Allende, Mexico. Chondrules form as molten or partially molten droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids. They represent one of the oldest solid materials within our solar system
