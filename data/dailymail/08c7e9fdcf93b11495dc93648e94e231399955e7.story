The grandfather of the murdered McStay family has said that if he was left alone in a room with the man arrested and charged with their violent murders, he would kill him.

Patrick McStay, whose son, daughter-in-law and their two sons were killed and buried in the desert, said that Charles 'Chase' Merritt would not survive a one-on-one encounter.

McStay also said that hearing Merritt - a business partner and close friend of his son Joseph - had been arrested over the killings was 'like a boulder falling on me'.

Speaking to CNN, he pointed out how Merritt had 'perfectly' described the area of the Mojave desert where the McStays - Joseph, 40, wife Summer, 43, Gianni, four and Joseph Junior, three - were dug up almost a year ago.

The family disappeared in February 2010, leaving investigators baffled until the bodies were found by chance. It then took another year before the Sheriff's department in San Bernadino County, California, moved to arrest Merrit.

He has now been charged with all four murders, and is being held in jail without bail, and has appeared briefly in court without making a plea.

Investigators believe the McStays were killed in their home in Fallbrook, California, by what they describe as 'blunt force trauma'.

If convicted of their murders, Merritt could face the death penalty, prosecutors said.

Patrick McStay's uncompromising intentions towards Merritt were revealed when he was asked on CNN what he would ask Merritt if he were alone with him.

He simply replied: 'I wouldn't ask him anything. There'd be one person coming out of that room.'

When asked whether he truly believed Merritt was capable of the murders, McStay reserved his judgement, saying: 'After all I've seen through the years and the information we've found, I still can't say yes - but I can definitely say I wonder.'

Authorities have not yet disclosed a motive for Merritt's alleged murders.

But McStay has suggested money was at the heart of the crime - saying that Joseph was on the cusp of dropping Merritt as his business partner due to sloppy work.

Joseph McStay was reportedly on the cusp of closing a $9million deal for his garden accessory business. If it came off, Merritt, whose model waterfalls McStay often bought, would profit, too.

But according to Patrick McStay the relationship had soured. In an earlier interview with NBC Los Angeles, McStay, from Houston, Texas, said: 'Chase was always somebody, you know, chasing the dollar and I think that's what it was, it was all about the money.'

Another relative, Joseph McStay's brother Michael, has also spoken publicly about Merritt.

At a news conference announcing his arrest, he said: 'Joseph was a great brother, a great father, he would've done anything to protect those boys and Summer and he tried to help Chase and provide work for this guy - and this is how he was repaid.'

'I know he's in a better place - I know that sounds a little trite but this gives our family a little more closure, the opportunity to heal and move forward and he'll get what he's got coming to him.'

Merritt himself has always denied the murders - and spoke at length with MailOnline last year about the McStay family.

He claimed to have taken and passed a lie detector test to remove himself from suspicion. He also said he hoped authorities would: 'find the a*******s who did this'.
