Employment Minister Esther McVey has revealed that she has never had children because she has not found someone to ‘wind up’ her biological clock. 

The 46-year-old former GMTV presenter, who was promoted to attend the Cabinet last week, said that despite ‘loving’ children, she has not met the right person to have them with.

In her first in-depth interview following the reshuffle, Miss McVey said: ‘I always thought as I was growing up that I’d be married with children. That hasn't happened.

‘So I guess that is a sacrifice because I do actually love kids: I just haven’t got them myself. Why? Because I obviously never met the person I was going to have children with, and I had to be realistic.

‘Was I going to put the right amount of time into that if I was living between two places? All I’m saying, having worked hard and been the breadwinner, for me, that’s how things ended up.’

‘This is how I am, I’m happy with my friends, my family, my job. I’ve had other friends who had such a burning desire to have children, they have this biological ticking clock . I don’t know what happened to mine. Nobody ever wound it up,’ she told Grazia (below). Miss McVey has had relationships with television producer Mal Young and Conservative Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, but has never married and is currently single.

She dominated headlines last week when she appeared outside Downing Street during a women-friendly reshuffle. Her job remained the same but she is now allowed to sit in on the Cabinet.

Yesterday, Tory MP Richard Drax was criticised for describing the reshuffle, which saw several women promoted, as the ‘Night of the Petticoats’. He also accused David Cameron of ‘tokenism’ and said female colleagues had been promoted because ‘a quota needs to be filled’.

But his claims were rubbished by fellow Tory MP Richard Benyon who said: ‘In a week that saw the Church of England finally come to its senses over women bishops we also saw some talented women MPs promoted. And some talented men.’

Miss McVey, a privately educated law graduate, attributed the media interest in the reshuffle to the idea that women are traditionally seen as nurturers.

‘We do want to know a little bit more about the soft side of a woman than we do of a man. 

'Maybe as a woman you want to say: “Do I like this lady, do I feel she’s one of us?”,’ she said.

Last week, she said the attention was ‘fine if it inspires girls to go into politics’.

The builder’s daughter from Liverpool has previously attributed her career achievements to hard graft.

Earlier this year, she said that young people should take jobs in Costa coffee shops because her own stint as a waitress had paved the way to her success in the media.

She added: ‘I’ve met people at the top of companies like Accenture who started off in McDonald’s.’
