While I love being brown, I hate getting a fake tan. Having to book a salon appointment the day before a big event, spending the rest of it looking as though I've been dipped in mud, reeking of that peculiar biscuity smell - there's nothing worse.

So when Fake Bake announced they'd developed the 60 Minute Tan, which can be washed off after just an hour when most demand you sit around for at least four, I was intrigued - especially given the recent storms that have stolen our summer sun.

Get out of bed! You can avoid the tanning bed and long spray-tan sessions with Fake Bake's 60-minute tan

'With fake tan, the commonly used chemicals, such as dihydroxyacetone, are activated upon contact with the skin to turn it brown,' says Victoria Halliday, UK Manager for Fake Bake At Home.

'But the 60 Minute Tan contains cutting-edge accelerators, meaning it develops within an hour and won't smell. You can take a shower after this and go out. It also contains a unique ingredient, which is activated when water hits the skin, so the shade continues to darken.'

It almost sounds too good to be true. While you can buy the product to apply yourself (£24.95), I decided to leave it to the professionals.

The company has more than 2,000 qualified therapists nationwide (find your nearest at fakebake.co.uk) who, for £25, will come to your house, set up their equipment and tan you. 

Golden success: Fake Bake lives up to the hype

It's far cheaper than a salon and you don't have to suffer the humiliation of staggering home afterwards looking like an Oompa Loompa.

Emma Edwards, owns the TLC salon in Trowbridge, and is 20 minutes from my Somerset home. She arrives with a large black pop-up tent, which she erects in seconds in my kitchen.

I stand wearing nothing but a pair of paper pants while she sprays me up and down with the brown liquid, starting with my arms, then moving on to my legs, bottom, back and finally face.

The same nozzle is then used to blow warm air to dry my tan. In all, it takes just five minutes.

When she's finished, I look down enchanted at my smooth brown body. My eyes appear brighter, my face healthier and I look half a stone lighter - and I don't smell.

I potter around the kitchen for an hour in my dressing gown, waiting for 60 minutes to elapse. When I stand under the shower, the water runs such a dark brown that I am convinced that my fake tan has washed off.

But to my amazement, I emerge looking as though I've spent the summer on a tropical beach.

When I take a quick nap, risking pristine white bed linen to see if their claim that the tan won't rub off on anything is true, the sheets stay spotless.

And at bedtime I scrutinise my white t-shirt and pale jeans.  There isn't a smudge on either. My one-hour tan has been a golden success.

It's not just advances in speed that are 
improving fake tans. 'The tanning market really has produced a tan for 
every occasion,' says Fake Bake's Victoria Halliday. 'Products now come 
in a range of shades and have added anti-cellulite or anti-ageing 
ingredients.'

Tan
 can multi-task as an anti-ageing product - try Lancome Flash Bronzer 
Tinted Anti-Age Self-Tanning Facial Lotion SPF15 (£22.50,

(£24.99, xen-tan.co.uk).

Temporary, water-resistant versions mean you
 can scrub off any mistakes with soap and water - such as St Moriz 
Instant Body Tan Wash Off (£4.99, boots.com) or Soap & Glory One 
Night Tanned (£11.50, boots.com). It's never been easier to achieve that
 bronzed glow for summer.
