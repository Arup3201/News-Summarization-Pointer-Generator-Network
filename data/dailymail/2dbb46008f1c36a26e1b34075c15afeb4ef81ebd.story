They’re going to need a bigger boat.

Incredible footage has emerged of a potential predator that has made itself at home in a small NSW coastal town.

A three-metre-long great white shark has become the latest tourist attraction in the Lake Macquarie on New South Wales’ Central Coast, but is putting a serious dampener on swimming plans.

There is much excitement about the new resident, who is now affectionately known as ‘The White’, and some locals have been seen engaging in some seriously alarming antics.

A cringe worthy video taken on Saturday shows enthusiastic locals trying to get ‘up close and personal’ and pat their new friend – an extremely questionable decision as they bob precariously on the water in an inflatable boat.

As the shark circles the vessel, a woman can be seen seen leaning her entire torso over the side of a boat with her hand skimming the water.

She attempts to pat the shark as its fin glides past just centimetres from her hand, cheering in delight as her friend is heard egging her on, yelling: ‘hey, give the shark a pat!’

The vision of her risky antics is even more unnerving due to footage taken just four days earlier which shows what is thought to be the same shark leaping around two metres into the air.

Two gentlemen were fishing in a 14-foot tinnie near Pulbah Island when they first sighted the incredible creature and captured footage of it leaping into the air twice

Two gentlemen were fishing in a 14-foot tinnie near Pulbah Island when they first sighted the incredible creature.

Although incredibly anxious at the sight of the shark, Rodney Collins and his brother-in-law Warren Sternbeck were amazed to see the big fish jump out of the water on two occasions.

‘We turned around and saw the water churning and then the shark surfaced,’’ he said. ‘‘I quickly pulled anchor and sped away because I didn’t know if it would jump in the boat. There were some choice words, it was a bit unnerving,’ Collins told Newcastle Herald. 

Another sighting of the man-eater at prompted council workers to erect shark warning signage at Murrays Beach the next day.

A sailing meet for juniors in nearby Belmont was cancelled due to the shark’s ominous presence.

There have been past shark spottings, including great whites, bull sharks and hammerhead sharks in the same salt water lagoon, which is connected to the ocean by the Swansea Channel. 

The lagoon is a tempting home for sharks as commercial fishing was banned from the waters in 2002.
