When Thomas Keller was asked if his 2004 New York venture would be a replica of his original restaurant the French Laundry, he replied that the eatery wouldn't be the same 'per se'.

The name stuck and Manhattan's Per Se was born.

Eight years later and it has crept into a list of the world's top ten of best restaurants at number six.

Other American establishments to have found their way into the hot list are Alinea of Chicago, at number seven, and Eleven Madison Park, of New York at number 10.

Per Se and Alinea beat the famed Heston Blumenthal who scraped in at number nine with his London eatery, with Eleven Madison Park falling just short of that.

Another of Blumenthal's restaurants fell out of the global top ten altogether which will be a blow for the chef.

Dinner, Blumenthal's latest venture, took its place in the chart, becoming the top ranking UK restaurant and the highest new entry.

Judges praised the Knightsbridge 
restaurant for providing ‘the reworking of historical British recipes 
from as far back as the 14th century’.

They added: ‘Diners can revel in the 
mandarin-tinged, super-smooth creamy chicken liver parfait of the meat 
fruit or the sweet fluffy indulgence of the Sauternes-soaked tipsy 
cake.’

A three-course set lunch menu at Dinner costs £32, and its most expensive main course is a fillet of Aberdeen Angus for £38.

The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, slipped out of the top ten but took 13th place.

At Blumenthal’s Michelin-starred restaurant, which secured fifth place last year, a three-hour tasting menu featuring such delicacies as snail porridge and powdered duck costs £180 per head.

Blumenthal’s position as Britain’s 
top celebrity chef was cemented in the annual list of the world’s 50 
best restaurants, revealed last night.

Compiled by Restaurant magazine, the prestigious awards are judged by a panel of more than 800 chefs, restaurateurs, journalists and food experts.

Australian chef Brett Graham’s restaurant Ledbury, in Notting Hill, also made it into the top 15, leaping 20 places to number 14 – the greatest climb by any restaurant in the chart.

‘Service standards are exceptional,’ judges said. ‘Graham’s low-key, refined techniques are original, but not overtly avant-garde.’

For the third consecutive year, the title of world’s best restaurant went to Noma in Copenhagen, Denmark. Chef Rene Redzepi receives thousands of reservation requests a day for his extravagant Nordic menu featuring dishes such as musk ox and smoked marrow, sea urchin and dill or beef cheek and pear.

The chefs’ choice award went to Andoni Luis Aduriz of Mugaritz in San Sebastian, Spain. Despite being devastated by a fire two years ago, the restaurant held on to third place in the chart.
