Thailand will install more surveillance cameras and better lighting in tourist areas following the murders of two British tourists last week.

In an effort to prevent further attacks, major cities and resort islands have been instructed to improve security as a matter of urgency, a senior government official said.

The deaths of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, are still being investigated after their battered bodies were found on a Koh Tao beach last week.

Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters he has ordered the Interior Ministry, Bangkok's city government and police to install the surveillance cameras and improve lighting. He said authorities are urgently investigating the case, which critics say has been bungled by police.

'The area where the incident happened was very dark. The closed-circuit cameras could not capture images. 

'I have ordered authorities nationwide that there must be sufficient lighting, especially in Bangkok and major tourist cities. And there must be closed-circuit TV cameras all over the country,' Prawit said. 'I'm confident we will see clearer results within two months.'

None of the dozens of DNA samples taken from migrant workers, Thai men and foreigners has matched the crime scene evidence, and no arrests have been made since the bodies were found on Sairee beach on September 15.

'Right now we have limited the investigation to some areas and some individuals. We are not getting lost like they said because we have to work systematically,' said Prawit.

The quiet, small island of Koh Tao is about 410 kilometers  south of Bangkok. 

It is a short boat ride from better-known Koh Samui and Koh Phangan, the latter known for raucous Full Moon parties that attract young travelers from Thailand and abroad.
