After a series of deadly tornadoes barreled through Kansas and Oklahoma this weekend and leveled Jessica Wilkinson's home, she cared about one thing above all others: finding her beloved terrier, Bella.

In heartwarming scenes of hope amid the devastation, photographs show Wilkinson sobbing as she frantically searches for her pet, before discovering her among the rubble of her home in Norman, Oklahoma and gripping her tightly.

The emotional reunion came after the severe weather rattled through Kansas and Oklahoma, killing two elderly men, injuring at least 21 more and leaving a  violent trail of destruction through the Midwest and South.

Several terrifying twisters were spotted on Saturday evening near Rozel, a sparsely populated area in central Kansas. They were also reported to the south in parts of Oklahoma and Iowa.

A National Weather Service advisory warned: 'You could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter.'

'Complete destruction of neighborhoods, businesses and vehicles will occur. Flying debris will be deadly to people and animals.'

At least four separate tornadoes 
touched down in central Oklahoma on Sunday afternoon, including one near
 the town of Shawnee, 35 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, that laid 
waste to much of a trailer park.

Two men, 79-year-old Glen Irish and 76-year-old Billy Hutchinson, were found dead after the tornado wrought its devastation on Shawnee, Oklahoma.

Irish's body was found out in the open after the storm passed through, while Hutchinson was taken to Norman Regional Hospital, but later pronounced dead, according to the medical examiner.

'You can see where there's absolutely
 nothing, then there are places where you have mobile home frames on top
 of each other, debris piled up,' Pottawatomie County Sheriff Mike Booth
 said after surviving damage in the Steelman Estates Mobile Home Park.

'It looks like there's been heavy equipment in there on a demolition tour.

'It's pretty bad. It's pretty much wiped out,' he said.

Across the state, 21 people were 
injured, not including those who suffered bumps and bruises and chose 
not to visit a hospital, said Keli Cain, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma 
Department of Emergency Management.

Booth said six at Steelman Estates were hurt.

On Interstate 40, tractor-trailers were blown off the road, and one was seen hanging over the highway's overpass.

Dozens
 of homes were damaged by the other tornadoes that touched down in 
Oklahoma, but emergency officials had no immediate reports of injuries 
caused by any of them, including the first of the afternoon that hit 
Edmond, a suburb north of Oklahoma City, before making its way toward 
Tulsa, 90 miles to the northeast.

'I knew it was coming,' said Randy 
Grau, who huddled with his wife and two young sons in their Edmond 
home's safe room when the tornado hit.

He said he peered out his window as the weather worsened and believed he saw a flock of birds heading down the street.

The destruction in the wake of the punishing storm led Oklahoma Gov Mary Fallin to declare a state of emergency for 16 counties.

The
 National Weather Service in Wichita put in place tornado warnings for 
East Central Kingman County, Southern Sedgwick County and Northwester 
Sumner County in the state.

The National Weather Service says 15 tornadoes touched down in north Texas on Wednesday.

Initial estimates put that number at 10, however the NWS added five more throughout Thursday afternoon.

In its preliminary findings, the National Weather Service rated the tornado that hit Hood County Wednesday night an EF-4, which is labeled 'devastating' by the Enhanced Fujita Scale.

The scale ranges from from FO, defined as a gale, to F5, defined as incredible.

The Storm Prediction Center had been warning about severe weather in the region since Wednesday, and on Friday, it zeroed in on Sunday as the day the storm system would likely pass through.'They've been calling for this all day,' Edmond resident Anita Wright said after riding out the twister in an underground shelter.She and her husband Ed emerged from their hiding place to find uprooted trees, downed limbs and damaged gutters in their home.In Katie Leathers' backyard, the family's trampoline was tossed through a section of fence and a giant tree uprooted.'I saw all the trees waving, and that's when I grabbed everyone and got into two closets,' Leathers said. 'All these trees just snapped.'
