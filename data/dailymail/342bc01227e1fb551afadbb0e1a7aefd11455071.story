Manchester United keeper Anders Lindegaard has been told by manager Louis van Gaal that he can find another club.

United want a fee for the Danish international, who is on the verge of leaving Old Trafford as Van Gaal prepares to promote Ben Amos to David de Gea's regular deputy.

Despite conceding a poor goal on tour to Roma's Miralem Pjanic, Amos has impressed Van Gaal with his attitude, training and form.

Sunnmorsposten, a newspaper based in Alesund where Lindegaard played for Aalesund FK before joining United in 2010, reported that Lindegaard had been let go by the Premier League club and that his agent, Michael Stensgaard, would be making a statement.

'Spread your wings and fly #mufc #fly #manchesterunited,' tweeted the 30-year-old Lindegaard, seemingly confirming his imminent exit from Old Trafford.

The Dane signed from Aalesund in 2010 and made 29 first-team appearances.
