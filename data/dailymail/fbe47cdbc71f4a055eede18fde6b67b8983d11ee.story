In a statement released on Sunday, West Midlands Police said: 'Detectives have launched an investigation after a Hertfordshire man received life-threatening injuries in an unprovoked assault in Wolverhampton yesterday.

'The 44-year-old was with a group of friends making their way to the train station to return home to Hemel Hempstead just after 5pm when they were attacked in Littles Lane.'

Detective Sergeant Adam Keen said: 'The group of friends were completely outnumbered and the victim suffered a severe head injury which has left him in a critical condition in hospital.

'His family have been informed and we are in the process of taking statements from witnesses and locating any CCTV which might have captured those responsible for the attack.

'I would urge anyone with information which will help our investigation to contact me as soon as possible on 101.'

Police also urged anyone wishing to offer information anonymously to call the Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.

Watford expressed shock over the incident, saying on the club's website: 'The thoughts of everyone associated with Watford FC are with a Hornets' supporter - at yesterday's game - who is now critically ill after an unprovoked post-match attack.'
