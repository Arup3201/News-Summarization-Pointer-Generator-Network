 A drawbridge, a prince charming and a medieval castle... It sounds like something from a Disney fairy tale, but this is surprisingly all available in Mount Crosby, Queensland (BYO prince charming).

Fit with a drawbridge at the entrance and three split level air conditioners throughout, this modern day fortress is available for rent for $550 per week.

The property boasts four Tudor-style bedrooms, an open plan kitchen fitted with a gas over and two bathrooms, one with a lion claw foot bath.

The medieval property is surrounded by small towers on top of the building known as turrets and pointed rectangular windows

A favourite feature of the property is the drawbridge that opens at the entrance and reveals a large timber door

From fine-grained slate floors to long pointed rectangular windows outside of turrets, everything inside the castle, down to the finest detail, illustrates the strong medieval theme.

Norma Trench from Brisbane West Rentals told Daily Mail Australia that the background of the Brisbane castle and its owners really is incredibly romantic.

'She was swept off her feet, within four months of meeting, they were engaged,' she said. 

'He was her prince charming, so they decided to build a castle.'

The castle is located at 79 Sheep Camp Road, Mount Crosby in Queenland and is 22 kilometres South-West of Brisbane CBD

Ben and Penelope Crossman kept the home's original foundations and renovated it in 2009 to resemble their dream castle

The bathroom basins are dark timber and there are old fashioned vanities scattered throughout, the tiles are mostly slate

The Crossman's have relocated to the Gold Coast for work and hope to rent to property out to tenants who will appreciate the fortress's charm

Ben and Penelope Crossman adjusted the original building in 2009 in order to make it look like a medieval castle and once it was erected, they were wed in it and then raised a young daughter.

Whilst the property is their dream home,  they have relocated to the Gold Coast for work and hope to rent to property out to tenants who will appreciate the fortress's charm and sentimental worth.

'The love is all in the detail,' Ms Trench said.

'The bathroom basins are dark timber and old fashioned vanities scattered throughout.'

The showers in both bathrooms have no curtain or door, continuing the relaxed, open plan theme that the kitchen offers.

Outside, the property is completely fenced in and there is a large water tank that is covered in timber to resemble a barrel.

On being asked whether the castle was always the plan, Ms. Trench said they always wanted their own fortress

The property is completely fenced in, allowing for pets and also features a large water tank covered in a timber casket to resemble a barrel

Whilst advertised as a rustic expanse, the property, 22 kilometres South-West of Brisbane CBD, is anything but primitive.

Ms. Trench assures that it is a perfect family home with enough modern touches to ensure its security.

'The drawbridge is mainly for visual appeal and there is a really big timber door as the main entrance.'

On being asked whether the castle was always the plan, Ms. Trench said they always wanted their own fortress.

'They said they would either build a pirate ship or a castle,' she laughed.
