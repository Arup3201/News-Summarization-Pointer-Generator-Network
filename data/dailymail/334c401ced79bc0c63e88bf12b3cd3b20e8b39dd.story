Good news for the incorrigible rogues across England and Wales: you are no longer committing a crime.

The offence, which came in under the Vagrancy Act 1824, is one of 309 to be repealed or removed from the statute book in the year to May. This is compared to 201 offences repealed in the previous 12 month period.

Other crimes removed in the period 
include ‘solemnising marriage outside specified hours’ under the 
Marriage Act 1949. This was repealed by the Protection of Freedoms Act 
2012, which removed restrictions on the time of day marriages or civil 
partnerships can take place.

It is no longer a criminal offence to be an incorrigible rogue in England and Wales (stock picture)

The figures released by the Ministry of Justice show only one offence – ‘conspire to sell/transfer a pistol it being a prohibited weapon’ - had any prosecutions from January 2008 to September 2013, with a total of 16 prosecutions between 2011 and 2012.

A total of 327 new criminal offences were created in the same period, a 12 per cent increase compared with the previous 12 months.

There was only one indictable only offence created - that is, it is so serious it can only be tried in a Crown court - under the Antarctic Act 2013, which makes it a crime to carry out activities in Antarctica, which directly or indirectly give rise to an environmental emergency and are connected with the UK.

More than 300 offences were repealed and removed from the statute book in the year to May

The Vagrancy Act 1824 was an ‘act for the punishment of idle and disorderly persons, and rogues and vagabonds’.

It was brought in to deal with problems in England following the Napoleonic Wars as large numbers of soldiers were discharged on to the streets with no job and no accommodation.

The Act, which essentially made it an offence to sleep on the streets or to beg, is still in force but has been amended several times by later legislation.

Of the offences repealed in the period to May, 2 per cent were indictable-only offences, 51 per cent were summary-only offences, which can be tried in a magistrates' court, and 47 per cent were triable either way.
