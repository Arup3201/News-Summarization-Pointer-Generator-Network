Independent Melbourne musician Chet Faker didn't just win the top gong for his song, Talk is Cheap, in triple j's Hottest 100 for 2014 - he also scored the seventh and eight position in the top ten.

But the real moment every music fan had been waiting for was whether US pop sensation Taylor Swift managed to sneak into the world's biggest music poll as rumours spread that the singer being banned from the annual countdown was part of a hoax.

Despite the huge online campaign, #tay4hottest100, to include the American star's smash hit, Shake it Off,  in the prestigious countdown - the chart topper, who garnered so much support that her single was expected to be voted in at number 12, was disqualified due to her affiliation with KFC following triple j's strict policy on artists not benefiting from commercial ventures that could influence votes from fans.

Independent Melbourne musician Chet Faker didn't just win the top gong for his song, Talk is Cheap, in triple j's Hottest 100 for 2014 - he also scored the seventh and eight position in the top ten

Taylor Swift was disqualified for a number of reasons, including KFC's decision to offer a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989. This violated Triple J's strict rules of entry

Although the award-winning artist didn't quit make the cut, Australian electronic music duo, Peking Duk, bagged two top five positions with High (featuring Nicole Millar) landing second place and Take me over (featuring Safia) in fifth spot.

1. Chet Faker - Talk is cheap

2. Peking Duk - High (featuring Nicole Millar)

3. Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater

4. Milky Chance - Stolen Dance

5. Peking Duk - Take me over (featuring SAFIA)

6. Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk (featuring       Bruno Mars)

7. Chet Faker - Gold

8. Chet Faker - 1998

9. Sia - Chandelier

10.Asgeir - King and Cross

While Australian hip hop band, Hilltop Hoods, who got their big break thanks to triple j's early support, came third with their single, Cosby Sweater.

The other two songs by Faker that were voted into the top ten were Gold, at seventh place with eighth spot going to 1998.

Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’.

An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted.

Daily Mail Australia viewed the post which is titled 'eight hilarious but totally true reasons you didn't hear Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100'. 

The humorous article, laden with sarcasm, has copied the format of the website 'Buzzfeed' which lead the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign.

'Their #Tay4Hottest100 campaign bought Taylor a one-way ticket to bansville,' a Triple J author wrote.

Although they did wish to clarify, 'triple j doesn't have beef with Taylor Swift.'

'She's smart, she's cool and she has excellent taste in BFFs,' in reference to Swift's friendship with Lorde, who made numerous appearances in last year's Hottest 100 countdown.

The Triple J website crashed just a minute after a link was posted explaining the decision to disqualify Taylor Swift from this year's Hottest 100

 Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’

However, they did point out that a Taylor Swift song was not played on Triple J at any point in 2014. 

The Triple J author explains that they took issue with the fact Buzzfeed, an international media company worth $850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat GIFs, was 'throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll'.

'It's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll,' Triple J wrote.

Triple J has strict rules which promise to 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'.

The article then points out the number of 'trolls' who voted for Taylor Swift to 'prod the hipsters for lulz', meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown.

'Do we really want to be talking about this every year?' Triple J asked. 

They argue that if the Taylor Swift campaign was successful it would have a long-term impact on their music poll, with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years, supporting people like 'Rebecca Black, Crazy Frog and Paris Hilton'.

That would be a 'sh***y, sh***y tragedy.' 

KFC were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown.

'Not every KFC idea is a good one,' pointed out Triple J in their 'Triple J Feed' post.  

The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers.

The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote.  

'"We'd prefer that people vote for the love of music, not the love of cholesterol",' Triple J responded on Australian Day, hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the Hottest 100 hype. 

An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted 

triple j confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'.

While ABC declined to comment officially before the countdown, former Triple J announcer Angela Catterns told The Drum on Monday that Swift had been disqualified.

Last week, unconfirmed rumours were rife that Taylor Swift had been disqualified because of this campaign. 

'You probably know that there was a push to get a Taylor Swift song in (the Hottest 100), which has now been disqualified because a fast food chain became involved in the whole process,' Ms Catterns said.

Following the announcment, Social Media was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision, others devastated by Swift’s exclusion.

‘Dear @triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things YOU MONSTERS,’ wrote Aya Reina.

‘Is it too cliche to tell @taylorswift13 fans to shake it off?’ said Chris Matthews-Darby

‘Now the people who were waiting for Taylor Swift, but have never listened to @triplej can go away now,’ said Ren.

Almost in direct response, Dylan Malloch posted ‘So, @triplej just ensured I won't be listening to any of the #hottest100 this year by not including #taylorswift.’   

Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters

The response to the potential blow KFC may have dealt to the #tay4hottest100campaign  has been as divided as the movement itself.

'Thank you KFC!!! You just invalidated this song from being in the hottest 100 by commercially incentivising it!!!' said one Facebook user.

'I hope that was your plan all along this just made my day as now I know the hottest 100 wont be tainted by this rubbish'.

'You've ruined #Tay4Hottest100 KFC! Arrghh!!!' said another user.

Other social media commentators were pleased with the seemingly unintended outcome.

'Fantastic. For the first time ever KFC has done something useful and gotten Taylor Swift disqualified from the hottest 100,' said one Facebook user.

'if this is the reason swift gets disqualified from the hottest 100 then I hereby pledge to only eat KFC when I have that fast food craving....' said another. 

A spokesperson for KFC spoke out about the campaign, denying accusations of 'incetivising' people to vote for Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100.

'We know many of our fans are music lovers and our recent post has caused a bit of a stir so to avoid any more confusion we have removed the post.'

'The post simply asked our fans to tell us what their favourite Taylor Swift song was for the opportunity to win a voucher, we were not incentivising people to vote for the Hottest 100. 

Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy.

Taylor Swift was given a number 75 ranking on the Social Hottest 100 which has proved an inaccurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves.

Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS

Too cool for school: The campaign to get Taylor on the list kicked off after super fan Joe McKenzi  tweeted ABC boss Mark Scott (pictured) about the omission of Swift's hit Shake It Off from the voting list
