Rail commuters face above-inflation fare rises in the New Year – with many season tickets crashing through the £5,000 barrier.

The increase across all types of tickets averages 2.2 per cent. But season tickets are going up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the Consumer Prices Index inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises.

Furious passengers, transport campaigners and union leaders called for an end to rail fare ‘rip-offs’ at a time of overcrowded ‘cattle class’ carriages and poor punctuality.

Experts calculated that many fares have risen three times faster than wages during the lifetime of this Parliament.

The new fares take effect on January 2. Among passengers who will have to pay more than £5,000 for an annual season ticket to London are commuters from Kent towns such as Tunbridge Wells and Ashford.

The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which announced the rises, said they were the lowest for five years and insisted that cash from fares helped maintain the service – but passengers were unconvinced and vented their fury.

Samantha Ovens, an artist from London, asked on Twitter if there was ‘any justification for a further increase in rail fares’ when we have ‘the most expensive travel service in Europe’.

Dawn Foster, from Liverpool, wrote: ‘Rail fares going up again in January, let’s hope you get your trains updated soon.’

Garry Clayton said that despite the rises it ‘will still be standing room only for the Wigan to Manchester train’.

Tory MP Dominic Raab has voiced his anger as a crushed passenger on the 7.32am Woking to Waterloo service, which was named Britain’s most crowded commuter train service.

He said his constituents were paying ‘for the privilege of travelling at one grade below cattle class’. Under the latest price rise, they will now pay more than £3,000 for their season ticket.

Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘The scandal of Britain’s great rail fares rip-off is that today’s hike is far outstripping average pay increases.

Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said rail fares were a 'rip off' and a 'scandal'

‘The British people pay some of the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out, understaffed and overcrowded services while the private train companies are laughing all the way to the bank. Today’s announcement fuels that scandal.’

Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘During this Parliament, many fares have risen three times faster than wages, putting enormous strain on household budgets.’

RDG director general Michael Roberts defended the rise by saying: ‘For every £1 spent on fares, 97p goes on track, train, staff and other costs while 3p goes in profits earned by train companies for running services on Europe’s fastest growing railway.’

Rail Minister Claire Perry said: ‘Passengers are rightly concerned about the cost and complexity of fares. That is why last year we announced a real-terms freeze on regulated fares for the firsttime in a decade and this continues into 2015.

‘As a further measure we have asked operators to improve the information passengers receive when buying a ticket.’

Labour’s transport spokesman Lilian Greenwood said: ‘David Cameron has failed to stand up for working people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, allowing the cost of some season tickets to rise by over 30per cent since 2010 – forcing people to pay thousands of pounds more to sit or stand on increasingly overcrowded trains.’
