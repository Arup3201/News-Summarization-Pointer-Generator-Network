Guilty: Former laundry owner Kevin Andrews, 61, was convicted of bullying former employees including making threats to burn them in acid and setting his dogs on them

A bullying laundry owner has been fined after issuing a string of threats against his staff such asburning them in acid, setting his dogs on them and taunting female workers about rape.

Kevin Andrews, 61, was found guilty of a catalogue of abuse against former workers at Mallee Laundry and Linen Services in the town of Mildura, Australia.

He was convicted by magistrates in Melbourne and fined $50,000 - worth around £30,000.

Between 2007 and 2009 he had repeatedly bullied works physically, psychologically and verbally, the court heard.

Magistrate Hugh Radford said on one occasion Andrews asked an employee to bring his dogs 
to the laundry ‘and if an employee stuffed up they would be bitten by 
the dogs – that is, the employee would be locked up with the dogs in a 
shipping container.’

The magistrate added that Andrews had
‘threatened the employees that he would dissolve them in acid, a 
substance that was available to them in the workplace.’

Mr Radford said that on one occasion 
Andrews told a female employee a rapist was waiting for her, following 
a talk that a sex offender was in the area.

‘This was clearly designed to 
frighten that particular employee,’ said the magistrate, who also 
referred to a fines list under which workers could be docked a week’s 
wages for ‘wasting time.’

‘In my view,’ said the magistrate, 
‘this may have been laughed off by some employees, but it was clearly 
designed by the accused to psychologically bully staff.’

Andrews called one woman a ‘big fat bush pig’ and said other women were brain dead and that ‘all women are dogs’.

Fourteen former employees came forward 
to testify against Andrews, who was also said to have tried to scare 
workers by producing a long, metal stick near them.

The workers also said they had been made to work 15 straight hours and were timed during toilet breaks.

Andrews denied bullying, an accusation brought by a government department known as WorkSafe.

But the magistrate said: ‘The 
accused’s response to the evidence was that it didn’t happen and was all
part of a conspiracy, which I do not accept.’

He described Andrews' behaviour as ‘disgusting and appalling’ and said it had caused his workers to suffer nightmares and depression up to five years later.
