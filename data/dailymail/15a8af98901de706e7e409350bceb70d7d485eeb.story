Nestled among horrific footage of the Hindenburg crash and a woman imprisoned in an underground room are bizarre, forgotten pieces of history - including a 10-stone toddler.

Now newsreel archive British Pathé has opened these vaults to the public, uploading all 85,000 of its films to Youtube as a gift to the public.

The firm was an iconic part of British life from 1896 to 1976, when for some the dramatic black-and-white reports aired in cinemas would be their only source of news.

General manager Alastair White described the films as a 'treasure trove' and said: 'Whether you’re looking for coverage of the Royal Family, the Titanic, the destruction of the Hindenburg, or quirky stories about British pastimes, it’ll be there on our channel. You can lose yourself for hours.'

MailOnline has chosen 10 of the best videos from the vast collection - ranging from the horrors of the First and Second World War to when one of London's busiest junctions was saved from gridlock by a huge flyover.

The most bizarre, however, must be 'Captive in a Cave', showing the underground bunker in south east London in which 28-year-old Marjorie Jordan was kept prisoner for three months. The kidnapping was only discovered when a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence.

Seen around the world, images of the bomb which devastated a Japanese city and ended the Second World War still fascinated audiences two decades later.

The documentary shows rare footage of bombs being made by the Americans before showing the mushroom-shaped blast and the devastation it wrought.

Unusually for newsreel commentaries - which are often more caustic than presenters would dare nowadays - a respectful silence is maintained over the footage of the explosion itself.

Battle and devastation dominated every second of newsreel during the First and Second World Wars, as it was often the only way of those on the Home Front seeing what happened overseas.

The Pathé archive includes huge numbers of videos from the conflicts, many of which were used to shore up support for the fighting at home.

This clip includes soldiers scurrying around huge guns which were used to fire shells upon enemy lines from the trenches.

The Nazi airship was supposed to be a testament to the prowess of Hitler's Germany, but famously crashed and exploded during a demonstration flight in New Jersey, killing 35.

This video reveals the extent of the devastation, with the flaming wreckage of the airship falling to the ground even as would-be rescuers try to help those trapped inside.

The solemn narrator describes it as 'an inferno which became a flaming tomb, a twisted mass of girders, the seared and scorched skeleton of what was once a mighty airship.'

Iconic in life, Marilyn Monroe enjoyed a little more privacy in death with crowds keeping at bay from a funeral organised by baseball star Joe Di Maggio.

Her casket is carried out of a suburban church in Hollywood before being taken to a cemetery crypt for a deeply private service.

The narrator tells audiences the ceremony had a 'dignity and simplicity denied to many Hollywood rites.'

The enthusiastic narrator was hardly exaggerating when he declared: 'Dawn on the greatest day the airport ever knew. Great to be alive.'

The day the Beatles arrived back at London Airport, now called Heathrow, in a plane named in their honour as fans massed on the roof has become one of the best-known incidences of Beatlemania.

The narrator declares that 'even the seagulls in the nearby reservoir flew off in hysterics'.

For some it may be hard to imagine the days when one Bee Gees singer could bring the young and beautiful people of London's most swinging street to a standstill.

But Barry Gibb does just that, waving to crowds of 8,000 in a packed Carnaby Street as balloons are released in celebration of his being named the best-dressed celebrity of the year.

Among Pathé's last cinema newsreels, the full-colour video shows Gibb arriving in a horse-drawn cart - though the hapless narrator does refer to 'The Status Quo'.

The archive's more bizarre offerings include this clip of three-year-old boy Leslie Bowles.

Seen with his parents in a sort of pen, Leslie sits in an armchair to cheery funfair music before someone dangles a bar of chocolate over his head.

The narrator dubiously claims the child is in good health and observes: 'Nowadays he refuses to be weighed at all so we don't really know whether he's solid or hollow.'

Another odd clip sees John Prentice, a self-proclaimed 'human fish' from Glasgow swimming lengths in a pool - with plates attached to his hands and feet.

The claims made about him seem exaggerated, however, when he attempts what is claimed to be a miraculous leap out of the water.

It may be the aged black-and-white footage, but it looks far more as though Mr Prentice simply turns over and dives to the bottom like any other swimmer.

Home to London's shopping Mecca, it is one of the most heavily gridlocked junctions in the country.

But the flow of traffic was once free and easy over Oxford Circus - after authorities built a bridge to allow the Tube station to be excavated below.

The temporary flyover was removed, however, just as everyone had got used to it - unveiling a 'grand a spacious ticket hall ready to cope with the ebb and flow of thousands of daily commuters' in the ground below.

The case of Austria's Josef Fritzl shocked the world, but it was not the first of its kind.

In an unassuming Victorian villa in south east London, authorities found 28-year-old Marjorie Jordan living in a secret underground room three months after she was captured.

But Miss Jordan - rescued after a neighbour found a note hurled over the fence - was never raped by her captor. Instead, a court heard labourer John Bridal forced her to help him extend the secret hole in the ground so he could use it to do his laundry.
