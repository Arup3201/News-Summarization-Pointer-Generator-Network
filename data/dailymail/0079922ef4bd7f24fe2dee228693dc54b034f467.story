Nodding off on a plane isn't always the easiest thing to do but customers at this unique hostel won't have the same problem.

The Jumbo Hostel is the first to have ever been built on board a real Boeing 747 jet.

It boasts 25 rooms including a luxury cockpit suite, showers and toilet facilities,  as well as breathtaking views across the runway at Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden.

High-flying on a budget: The Jumbo Hostel is the first to be built on board a real Boeing 747 jet

The hostel, complete with lounge and cafe, is situated on the runway at Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden

A room with a view: This private double bedroom cockpit suite overlooks the runway

The hostel offers the usual facilities including a bed, flat screen TV, Wi-Fi, and breakfast from the lounge cafe.

Flyers can also use a free shuttle to take them across the runway to catch their actual plane at the main airport. 

But the price dramatically varies depending on the type of room customers opt for. Starting at just £34.32 per person to share a four bedroom dorm right up to £159.33 for a private deluxe double bedroom with private shower facilities.

The innovative hostel was opened in January 2009 after the jumbo jet was given a complete overhaul and renovated.

Unique experience: Some of the original seating from when the Boeing was still in action remains on board

A single suite: The plane also has single rooms with en-suite bathroom facilities costing around £137 a night

Out of service: The 747-200 plane was built in 1976 and grounded in 2002 after being decommissioned

It has been grounded since 2002 and is a decommissioned 747-200 model that was built in 1976.

A description on the hostel's website reads: 'Welcome to one of the world's coolest stays! Here you can spend the night on board a real jumbo jet - on the ground.

'Jumbo Hostel is the world's first hostel housed in a Boeing 747. Stockholm Arlanda is the first facility in Jumbo Hostel chain.

'Night and day visitors will experience the unique feeling of staying inside a jumbo jet, retired and converted into a hostel and museum.'

Stockholm Arlanda, which is open 24 hours a day, is the first facility in Jumbo Hostel chain
