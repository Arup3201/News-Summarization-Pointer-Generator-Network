Travel back in time and experience life from more than 100 years ago.

From horse-carriages, typewriters to women playing tennis in long gowns, the captivating  scenes of never-before-seen photographs of Brisbane has uncovered the forgotten moments of time.

Published in a new book, titled Lost Brisbane and surrounding areas 1860-1960, the collection of photographs highlights the historical changes in landscapes, streetscapes, work places, transport, fashion and recreational pursuits.

It's a world for the most avid historical fans, especially for the older generations who can remember their first tram ride or the day when colour television was introduced in Australia.

Queen Street, 1953: Until the late 1960s, trams ran along the entire length of Queen Street and cars could be parked in the main street of Brisbane. Buildings on the left included Christies Café, Tattersall’s Club, Bayards, His Majesty’s Theatre, Wintergarden Theatre (WGT), and T&G Mutual Life Society Building

The idea came to light when QBD The Bookstore director Steve Robinson was inspired during his travels in the UK when he stumbled across the ‘Lost London’ book at the London Book Fair.

The book illustrates a journey through time, from Spring Hill’s Wickham Terrace, featuring the city’s stunning landmarks, which prompted Robinson to pitch the idea to The Royal Historical Society of Queensland for a Brisbane version.

‘I grew up in southeast Queensland and am passionate about the region,’ Robinson told the Courier Mail. ‘Because QBD is a family-owned business it is possible to do this kind of project.’

Tennis in the Botanic Gardens, 1894: Tennis has always been a popular recreational activity. This photograph shows a foursome alongside the courts in the shadow of the Queensland Club on the corner of George and Alice Streets. The ladies wore long gowns while the men had their usual attire, no doubt giving them great freedom of movement

Clan MacGillivray troopship A46 at Pinkenba Wharf, c.1916: Family members are farewelling troops leaving Pinkenba on board A46  in about 1916. On the voyage a member of the 3rd reinforcements of the 41st battalion produced a magazine ‘MacGillivray Magster’. The ship had been launched in June 1911 and completed by Sir WG Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. Ltd, at Newcastle-on-Tyne for Clan Line Steamers

Arch built to welcome the Duke and Duchess of York, May 1901: This is one side of the massive four-faced triumphal arch erected at the intersection of George and Queen Streets. The arch was ornamented with portraits of the royal visitors and other imperial figures,  electric light at night and decorated with Queensland products. Lower arch inscribed the words - ‘Made glorious summer by this sun of York’

Despite Brisbane’s hilly terrain, which made it difficult for transport systems to develop, residents still enjoyed picturesque views of their town.

Governors, politicians, pastoralists and businessmen built large homes on the slopes above the beach to enjoy the sea breezes and views to the bay islands, followed by hotels and boarding houses.

Family members were pictured farewelling troops as they boarded the ship to fight in Gallipoli, while another photograph captures the 1890 flood at the intersection of Melbourne and Grey Streets.

Pineapple Plantation showing irrigation layout, Moggill, 1949: In the 1940-50s pineapple growing was well established in the Moggill area. William Westaway was one of the first in the district to grow the smooth leaf pineapple in commercial quantities. In 1919 he sold his pineapple farm to HB Alpin. The pineapple farms continued to flourish until they were eventually overtaken by suburban development

King Sandy: Young man, King Sandy (‘Ker-Walli’) is wearing a breast plate inscribed with his name. A photograph of him as an elderly man gave his location as Toorbal Point and Ningi Ningi north of Brisbane as his tribal group. King Sandy was among 25 Aboriginals, who accompanied Tom Petrie in 1862 to the Mooloolah and Maroochy Rivers’ area to mark out cedar trees for the timber industry

Greenmount Beach, Coolangatta, January 1956: Large crowds enjoy the Christmas holidays

One major feature that is now lost in central Brisbane was the extent of factories and industry adjacent to and in the midst of retail and residential buildings.

Not only does the book illustrate the buildings and places that no longer exist, the photographs record the everyday life of the city and how the landscapes of the development and changes during the black and white era.

According to the Courier Mail, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast was included to the book because Robinson believed the destinations were strongly tied to Brisbane.

‘I really wanted it to be about south east Queensland and not just Brisbane, because growing up in Brisbane, we all experienced south east Queensland as a whole – the places Brisbane people found iconic,’ Robinson told the Courier Mail.

Collaborated by The Royal Historical Society of Queensland and QBD The Bookshop, more than 500 photographs from the Society’s Photographic Collection are printed in the book.

Government Statistician’s Office, Treasury Building, October 1949: These typists are working in the equivalent of modern-day ‘work stations’.

The Story Bridge, 5 March 1941: Toll gates can be seen at the bridge’s southern approach. Although an engineering success, the bridge was regarded initially as a white elephant, the toll being unpopular and the traffic demand negligible. In 1947 the bridge was transferred to the Brisbane City Council and the toll removed. The bridge allowed direct access from the southern suburbs to Valley department stores

Norman Creek Bridge, 1886: The creek’s name is said to date from the early years of the Moreton Bay Settlement when Norman, a lime maker, lived near its banks. The bridge pictured was referred to as the first bridge and was constructed in 1885.The homes on the right were occupied successively by the Brabson, Pointon and Beattie families. Further on was the Harding’s house and then Weir’s dairy
