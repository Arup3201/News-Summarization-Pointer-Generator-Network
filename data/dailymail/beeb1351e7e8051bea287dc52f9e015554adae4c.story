Anyone who has read Cheryl Strayed's best-selling book Wild knows that her hiking boots are a central part of the story.

And now, following the release of the film interpretation starring Reese Witherspoon, REI has released the Danner Mountain Light Cascade boot, a replica of the author's original footwear, for $299.

The shoes, which famously appears on the cover of the 2012 book, come in 'the exact box used in 1995 when Cheryl Strayed set off to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.'

The new shoes, a tribute to the iconic style originally introduced in the 1970s, were custom-made for Reese to wear in the movie.

In the memoir, Cheryl suffers through several weeks and hundreds of miles of trekking while wearing a pair of boots that are a size too small.

So she is understandably ecstatic when, halfway through her journey, the company sends her a new pair for free thanks to a 100per cent customer satisfaction guarantee.

Even though Cheryl - and in turn, Reese Witherspoon - mentions the brand and model of the shoes multiple times throughout the story, REI reportedly did not pay for the mention.

But to celebrate the launch of the film, Danner has released a replica of Cheryl's rugged brown hiking boots at select stores.

According to the Danner website, the boots are 'a tribute to one of Danner's iconic hiking styles introduced in the early 1970's - a style believed by many to be the greatest backpacking boot of all time'.

Just like Cheryl's pair, the shoes feature retro red laces. They also come with sew-on Pacific Crest Trail mile marker patches.

Wild the movie, which was released in the U.S. on December 5th, has received much critical acclaim.

On Monday, it was revealed that Reese Witherspoon was nominated for best actress at the upcoming Critics' Choice Movie Awards for her role as Cheryl Strayed.

Reese will be competing against Jennifer Aniston (Cake), Marion Cotillard (Two Days, One Night), Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), and Gone Girl's Rosamund Pike for the award.

The star took to Twitter after receiving the happy news, writing, 'Thank you!!!' and retweeting the Critics' Choice mention.

In Wild, Reese tells the true story of Cheryl Strayed's autobiographical accounts as she trekked the Pacific Crest Trail, which is estimated to be approximately 1,100 miles long.

Also starring in the critically favored motion picture are actors Laura Dern and Michiel Huisman.Â
