Thanks to the efforts of a gun-toting Good Samaritan in Georgia, a would-be bank robber is behind bars.

A man whose name has not been released was in a Wells Fargo in Marietta when he saw another customer come in and present a teller with a 'demand note' on Tuesday afternoon. 

The suspect, 25-year-old Mark Katchem of Chicago, then left the bank.

The 25-year-old was booked at the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and is being held on a $15,000 bond

The Good Samaritan followed him out the door and grabbed a handgun from his car, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. 

The man, who used to be in the military, ran after Katchem and tackled him to the ground. 

He ordered Katchem to stay on the pavement and held him at gunpoint until police could arrive on the scene.

The alleged bank robbery occurred at a Wells Fargo in Marietta, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon

A man witnessed what was happening outside the bank and took a photo, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. 

He said: 'I immediately knew by the way the man was standing, his stance, he was in control of the situation.

'When you see a situation that ain't right, some people still do the right thing.' 

Katchem was arrested and charged with robbery by intimidation.

 If he's convicted, Ketchem is facing imprisonment for a minimum of ten to a maximum of 20 years

He was booked at the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and is being held on a $15,000 bond.

A woman who lives near the bank, Charise Debarros, said it was 'wonderful' that someone was willing to take action against the 'bad people out there'. 

Although robbery by intimidation can sometimes be viewed as a 'lesser' charge, it is often treated the same way as armed robbery. 

That felony charge is punishable by death or imprisonment for a minimum of ten to a maximum of 20 years.
