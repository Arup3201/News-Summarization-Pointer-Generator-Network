The daughter of disgraced politician John Edwards has had a complicated relationship with her father that was put to the test by a public sex scandal and legal woes, but she has never doubted her father was innocent of the federal charges brought against him.   

In 2011, the Democratic presidential candidate was indicted on six felony counts for allegedly misusing campaign funds in an effort to hide his relationship with his videographer-turned-mistress Rielle Hunter.

Despite her anger over her father’s infidelity that played out while her mother was dying of cancer, Cate Edwards, 31, dropped everything to be there every day of the criminal trial.

Loyal daughter: Cate Edwards, right, said that it never crossed her mind to gloat over her father's legal troubles or think of him as a criminal

In an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, Miss Edwards said that it never crossed her mind to gloat over her father’s legal troubles or think of him as a criminal.   

‘I did not fault my bad for the trial,’ she said. ‘He made those mistakes, there is no question, but I had never, ever felt he did anything illegal.’ 

A federal jury eventually found Edwards not guilty on one count and deadlocked on the others.

The disgraced politician’s daughter revealed that it was hard on the family to see a very private and difficult chapter of their lives ‘rehashed in front of everyone.’

‘But there was nowhere else I would have rather been at the time,’ Miss Edwards said. .

When asked about her father’s future in politics, Cate Edwards replied that she highly doubts he will ever run for office again.

Edwards also addressed her relationship with her 4-year-old half-sister, who was conceived out of her father's love affair with his videographer during his bid for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.

'She's my sister... she's just a really sweet, innocent little girl,' Cate Edwards, 31, said of 4-year-old Quinn Hunter in an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie. 'I certainly think of her as part of our family.'

Quinn is the daughter of John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter, whom Cate said she hasn't seen in years. Hunter has recently published a tell-all book about her romance with the former North Carolina senator.

'She's my sister:' Cate Edwards said she maintains a relationship with her 4-year-old half sister, Quinn, (pictured with Edwards), who was conceived out of her father's love affair

Cate Edwards said she met Rielle while she was working on her father's campaign and that she hasn't seen her since.

Asked about Rielle's book, Edwards said, 'I thought it was a poor choice... that's all I can say.'

Edwards said she was angry at her father when he told her about the affair, but that she eventually forgave him.

'I was devastated, and I was disappointed,' she said. 'Forgiveness is a tough thing... It was hard, but we worked through it.'

She couldn't answer to whether her 
father was every forgiven by her mother, Elizabeth Edwards, who died of 
cancer less than three years ago at the age of 61.

Siblings: Cate Edwards has two younger siblings,
Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised 
by her father

'I think she did [forgive him],' 
Edwards said of her mother. 'I don't know the answer to that. 'I think 
she had a mix of emotions.'

Despite the affair, John Edwards wanted to be by Elizabeth's side on her deathbed.

'He called and said, "Can I come?" Cate recalled. 'I said, "Mom, can Dad come?" And she said "yes."'

Looking back on their final moments 
together, she said, 'The three of us, especially, have been through so 
much together, so we garner a lot of strength from one another, and I 
think being together during that time - and also for the kids, to have 
their family together during that time - was incredibly important.'

Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised by her father.

She was very close to her mother, 
telling NBC that she was particularly upset by her mother's absence from
her October 2011 wedding.

Family: Cate was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010, and ever since Cate has been helping raise her younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack

Big day: Cate got married in 2011, and her sister Emma Claire (right) served in the wedding party. She said that her wedding was one of the biggest days that she missed her mother

Love: Cate Edwards' husband says she's a deeply compassionate woman

But she also misses her mother in small ways every day, she said.

'I mean, I get away with bad grammar,' she said, grinning. 'I never used to get away with bad grammar.'

The affair between Edwards and Hunter 
began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back 
in 2004, and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the 
presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit
that he had cheated on his popular wife Elizabeth.

In a 2008 interview, Edwards said that he did have an affair with Hunter but he was not the father of her daughter Quinn.

He later retracted this statement.

Speaking out: Cate was listed as a possible witness during the trial but she was never called to the stand

Throughout the ordeal, Edwards' aide Andrew Young volunteered to pretend that he was the father of Hunter's child, and they used nearly $1million to cover Hunter's tracks, flying her across country with the Youngs and keeping her hidden in various mansions.

That money was the focus of the federal trial against Edwards, where they had to prove that the money used to hide Hunter was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to Edwards' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair.

Cate was actually listed by the defense as a possible witness in Edwards' case, but she was never actually called to the stand.

The public attention surrounding the Edwards family drama did not die down after the trial ended in May, as Hunter released a tell-all book just a few months later where she trashed Elizabeth.

In her book 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me', Hunter describes the Edwards' marriage as broken by the time she arrived on the scene.

Rielle Hunter announced last summer that she and her longtime lover John Edwards are 'no longer a couple'

She wrote that Elizabeth- who at the time was battling her second bout of breast cancer- was a 'witch on wheels' who belittled her beloved Johnny and was very aware that their marriage was on the outs.

Hunter has faced much criticism for painting such a grim portrait of Elizabeth in her book, especially since she died in 2010 and she can no longer respond to Hunter's claims.

That criticism was echoed by Cate in her NBC interview, set to air on Friday.

'I just thought it was — I thought it was a poor choice, I guess, is all I can say,' Cate said diplomatically.

As for Hunter's current role in their family, it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and 'Johnny' had just decided to end their relationship, though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with Quinn for Father's Day.
