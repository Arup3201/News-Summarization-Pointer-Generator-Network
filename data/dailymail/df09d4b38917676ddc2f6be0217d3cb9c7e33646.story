David Cameron and his fellow world leaders at a major international summit today took part in a war game to test how they would react to an outbreak of nuclear terrorism.

At the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) in The Hague the Prime Minister, US president Barack Obama and other leaders were faced with a nightmare scenario involving terrorists potentially getting hold of a weapon of mass destruction.

The organisers of the summit said the leaders were faced with a 'fictitious but realistic scenario' about the possibility of nuclear material going missing.

In a series of anonymous tests the 
leaders were asked to respond to various events, using a touch screen to
 record their answers.

The
 NSS organisers said: 'This is the first time that an interactive 
approach of this nature has been taken at such an extensive summit.'

The
 event has been compared with the 1980s' movie WarGames, which starred 
Matthew Broderick as a hacker who accesses a United States military 
supercomputer, which asks him if he would like to play a game of 'global thermonuclear war' and nearly triggers one in real life.

World leaders sit for a plenary session of the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague, Netherlands. Leaders from around the world have come to discuss matters related to international nuclear security, though the summit has been overshadowed by recent events in Ukraine

The
 simulation had a happy outcome, with the collective decisions made by 
the world leaders meaning they were able to stop the terrorist network 
before it could actually build a dirty bomb.

NSS
 spokesman Frank Wassenaar said they preferred to call it a 
'scenario-based policy discussion' rather than a war game and the 
leaders were 'enthusiastic' participants.

They were shown a video setting out the scenario, which was then followed by a discussion of ideas between the leaders.

Following that there were two more video updates, designed to reflect the changing picture in a fast-moving incident.

Mr
 Wassenaar said: 'We had an enthusiastic reaction. It was quite 
innovative and not the convention in a summit like this. Usually the 
leaders of delegations just make a statement.'

The
 leaders were given a series of multiple-choice responses to the 
scenarios, with four potential options to select from. Their anonymous 
responses were then shared with the group.

Mr Wassenaar said: 'The leaders debated freely. Of course, there is no good solution or bad solution.'

The summit at The Hague is aimed at preventing the kind of situation envisaged in the war game.

A
 No 10 source said: 'The war games-style tabletop session was an 
innovative way of bringing the summit to life and encouraging leaders to
 share their own thoughts and experiences of handling such tense 
situations.

'The PM liked the interactive style and the fact leaders were confronted with different events they had to respond to.

'And
 it should be reassuring to people that they took the right decisions to
 ensure a happy ending where the terrorists didn't succeed in making a 
bomb.'

Some
 35 of the countries present - including the UK - agreed to allow teams 
of international experts to evaluate the effectiveness of their nuclear 
security measures, and international guidelines on the protection of 
nuclear materials will be translated into national legislation.
