They're great friends who attend events, share pals in common and even climb mountains together, so attending a charity reception where Holly Branson was giving a speech was no stretch for  Princess Beatrice.

The royal wore a blue jacket over a black dress, with a black crocodile clutch at a cocktail reception and dinner ahead of We Day UK event on Friday.

Holly Branson, Sir Richard Branson's daughter, who co-chairs the day-long charity festivities, gave a speech to an audience that included her father, brother Sam Branson and actor Martin Sheen, on her first day back to work after having twins in December.

We Day UK takes place at The SSE Arena, Wembley, tomorrow where Martin Sheen, Sir Richard Branson, Conor Maynard, Kweku Mandela, Years & Years, Bars & Melody and other names will speak or perform at the event to 12,000 people.

The event hopes to kick off another year of volunteering and charitable giving.

Princess Beatrice, 26, supports the annual event alongside her cousin Prince Harry. She tweeted, '‘Proud to be supporting @weday this Friday @HollyBranson is making the opening speech, good luck you’ll do great.’

In September Beatrice and Holly took part in the Big Climb with Sam Branson, his then fiancee Isabella Calthorpe, and two other friends in 2012.

The six chums, who ran the 2010 London marathon together dressed as a giant caterpillar, used the climb to launch their new charitable venture, Big Change.

At the We Day event, Beatrice and Holly posed for pictures alongside Sam and their entrepreneur father Sir Richard.

The celebration dinner was hosted by Hani Farsi, who owns the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, where the event was hosted. 

Brothers Marc and Craig Kielburger, who founded We Day were also there.

Guests enjoyed a menu that included seared beef fillet with confit potato and gianduja mousse with hazelnut caramel.

Holly Branson clearly called a babysitter for the night, as she and husband Fred Andrewes have three-month old twins, Etta and Artie.

Before an appearance on Sky News, she tweeted yesterday: 'First day doing some work since having twins and thrown in the deep end!'

While her brother announced in September that he and his wife were expecting.
