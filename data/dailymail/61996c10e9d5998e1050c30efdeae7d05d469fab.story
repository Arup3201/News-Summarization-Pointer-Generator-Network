A cruel farmer shot two innocent dogs with a bolt-gun and left them to die a slow and painful death, a court heard.

Simon Tidswell, 46, came across the family pets after they escaped from their owner and were left with him for safekeeping.

The farmer, who lives in Oxenhope, West Yorkshire, shot the dogs, Frank and Macy at point blank range, and left their bodies under a pile of wood in his barn, it was reported.

Macy (left) and Frank (centre) escaped from the open boot of their owner's car and ran off before she could find them. They were found by a local man who left them in Simon Tidswell's care in the hope their owner would soon come for them

The dogs were found by John Hodgson who was out walking his own pet, and given to Tidswell to look after in March.

Instead
the farmer, who claimed to be a trained slaughterman, killed the 
animals, shooting them in such a way that inflicted a slow and painful 
death.

Police vet, 
Simon Newby carried out a postmortem, concluding there was 'a very small
chance they were killed instantly', as Tidswell had missed the brain of
one dog and slightly damaged the other's when shooting them.

His brutal killing of the animals has left their owner, Zoe Kerr devastated.

She said: 'Tidswell's unforgivable killing of Macy and Frank has ripped a massive hole in our family.

'To have them taken from us in such cruel circumstances was devastating.

'The
fact that they had been caught and were held by a well-meaning member 
of the public, but were then taken by Tidswell was heartbreaking.'

Zoe Kerr is devastated after the loss of her two dogs who were killed in 'cold blood'. Her only pet now is Macy's pup, Dave who is a Husky cross

Ms Kerr recalled how the dogs, who were microchipped and wore collars, jumped out of her car and ran off, leaving Macy's pup, Dave behind.

The 36 year-old hairdresser quickly formed a search party and contacted local residents, including Tidswell whose farm she visited, only to be told he hadn't seen the dogs.

'I was frantic and together with lots of friends and people from Young 
Farmers I organised a search party and we covered about 90 per cent of 
Oxenhope Moor and looked for them well after nightfall without success,' Ms Kerr said. 

The following morning, the wife of Mr Hodgson who had found the dogs, phoned her to let her know her husband had put them on a lead and left them in Tidswell's care. 

Ms Kerr then contacted the police who searched the run-down property in Pennine Hills and found the dogs' lifeless bodies under a heap of wood in the barn.

The 46 year-old conceded two counts of criminal damage and admitted failing to ensure the needs of an animal were met before Bradford Magistrate's Court.

He was sentenced to 12 weeks in jail and has been ordered to complete 120 hours of unpaid work in the community.

His crimes have left Zoe and her four year-old daughter Esme who live in nearby Haworth, distraught.

'For weeks afterwards, my troubled 
sleep was plagued with nightmares and dreadful images of what he'd done 
to my pets and I constantly faced the thought of them being taken by 
him, going willingly with him, and then being shot in the head with a 
bolt gun when they had done nothing wrong.

'When
I called at his farm he said he'd not seen them. I'm heartbroken to 
think that as he lied to me my two dogs were lying dead in his barn.

'What he'd done instead was tie them up in his barn and shoot them at point blank range with a bolt gun.'

Ms Kerr said the man who found the dogs in the first place, Mr Hodgson, is devastated after leaving them with the evil farmer.

'I'm
a country type and understand that if my dogs had been worrying sheep, 
the farmer would be fully within his rights to shoot them, but they had 
not touched any lambs and were completely innocent.

'They were killed in cold blood and for no other reason than malice.

'I take full responsibility for them escaping and running away. I feel so guilty, it's killing me.

'Now I'm just left with Dave, who is Macy's pup.'

Animal
rights group Caged, which is campaigning for bolt guns to be banned, 
staged a demonstration outside the court and said Tidswell's sentence 
was too lenient.

Spokesperson
Rita James said: 'It's disgusting. It's absolutely saying to everyone 
else out there you can use a bolt gun and you are going to walk free.'

Tidswell refused to comment after the hearing.
