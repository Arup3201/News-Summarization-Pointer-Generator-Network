A seven-year-old girl was killed and her brother is missing after a mud geyser unexpectedly erupted.

The two children were walking with their father on the boy's ninth birthday in the Maccalube nature reserve, north of Agrigento, in southern Sicily. 

The father, a police officer, was uninjured, but the girl's body was found shortly after the eruption on Saturday, while the boy could not be found.

Geysers are among the most rare natural phenomena on Earth and so tragedies like this are rare

They are among the most rare natural phenomena on Earth. 

Geologic conditions, such as hot springs and volcanoes, must be present for geysers to exist. 

Most of the world's geysers are spread among five countries:

United States - Yellowstone National Park

Russia - Dolina Geiserov

Chile - El Tatio

New Zealand - Taupo Volcanic Zone

Iceland - many locations
