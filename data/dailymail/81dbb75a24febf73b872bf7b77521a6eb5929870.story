Very soon, all customers could need to withdraw money from an ATM is their mobile phones

Bank cards in Australia could soon become obsolete, with the second of the big four banks introducing cardless cash withdrawal options.

Commonwealth Bank was the pioneer of this service, introducing their system which only requires an iPhone to get money out from one of their ATMS.

Already more than $1 million has been withdrawn in more than 15,000 transactions since the new technology was released in May.

The next bank to roll out the concept is Westpac, set to launch a similar system called 'emergency cash', according to news.com.au.

The chief product officer for Westpac David Lindberg told the website the bank is introducing the system this month, which will allow customers to withdraw up to $1,000 per day.

The maximum amount per week is $2,000, and is designed for customers caught off guard without their card.

They are sent a six digit code to their mobile phone after calling the bank, which customers can then punch into an ATM.

It is believed the bank will eventually make this service available via an app.

Commonwealth Bank has already done this, and users are sent an eight-digit code and four-digit pin to their iPhones following a request on the app.

The Commonwealth Bank was the first to introduce the system for it's customers

These details are then entered into an ATM and used to withdraw cash, though customers are only entitled to $200 per day.

Commonwealth Bank’s executive general manager of cards, payments, analytics & retail strategy, Angus Sullivan said the bank already have more than 2.5 million people using the app.

'There’s a population of really early adopters who are using the phone to pay and they’re now using the phone to get cash out,' he said.

Westpac will be the next of the big four banks to roll out a cardless cash withdrawal method

The transactions are as safe as any other method of cash withdrawal or payment, strategic relations firm RFi research director, Alex Boorman told the site.

'You have to be able to log into the app and there’s a $200 maximum on the withdrawals which is another thing to help address any security concerns consumers have.'

He assured users it's a reliable method and removes any chance of their cards being skimmed.
