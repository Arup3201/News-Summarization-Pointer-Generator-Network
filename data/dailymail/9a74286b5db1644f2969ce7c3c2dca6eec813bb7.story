A man has been caught trying to smuggle a Blackberry mobile phone, a recharger, a pair of earphones and a sim car into a Brazilian prison hidden in his bottom.

Jean Ferreira Roque, 19, has said he had been hired by the wife of an inmate to smuggle the Blackberry Curve bundle into the Puraquequara jail in Manaus, northern Brazil.

Roque was caught passing through an X-ray scan during visiting hours at the prison on Boxing Day.

He claimed he was to receive Â£45 for delivering the phone, which is 2.36 inches wide.

The student told Brazil's Globo G1 website it wasn't the first time he had used the unconventional method to bring in phones for prisoners at the high-security jail.

He said: 'I've delivered lots of phones, I delivered a Blackberry to another inmate last week. This is just the first time I've been caught.

'I went to sit down and they must have noticed something wasn't quite right because they asked for me to go through the metal detector.

'That's when they saw the mobile phone.'

He added: 'I get paid once the phone is safely delivered. There's a price list, the bigger the phone, the higher the price.'

Manaus police chief Debora Mafra today said she has ordered an investigation into the smuggling claims.

She said: 'This needs to stop. We will probe as deep as we have to in order to find out who is behind all this.'

Roque has claimed he has smuggled phones into the prison in the past and gets paid depending on the size of the handset
