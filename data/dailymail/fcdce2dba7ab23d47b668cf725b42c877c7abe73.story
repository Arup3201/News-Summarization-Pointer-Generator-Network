These huge paintings are the work of a secretive graffiti artist who travels the world tagging walls, often painting his quirky pieces in a hurry to avoid arrest.

Chinese-born DALeast lives in South Africa but spends six months of the year travelling and has tagged walls on nearly every continent.

His unusual paintings, which are sometimes hundreds of feet across, can look 3D and as if they are created out of thousands of tiny metal shards, but in fact they have been spray-painted onto a flat surface.

Original style: This mural of two big cats fighting was painted by secretive Chinese-born graffiti artist DALeast in Hanbury Street, near London's Brick Lane

Astonishingly lifelike: This beautiful mural on a wall in the artist's home city Cape Town, South Africa, looks like slowed-down footage of the animal leaping

DALeast's works can be seen in Cape Town, Miami, New York and London's Brick Lane, as well as his native China.

The 29-year-old, who keeps his real name a secret, has been making art since he was three.

He said: 'I worked on everything when I was in China - painting, sculpture, installations, synchronising performance, and digital art, but I only started painting in public spaces in 2004.'

DALeast, who now lives with his wife, also an artist, in Cape Town, said he creates his pieces 'Spiritually, in the mind' before embarking on his painting trips.

Much of his work portrays wild animals hunting prey, often showing them in motion.

The nature of the artist's work has landed him in trouble before, most notably just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics when police raided a house he was staying in and arrested him and his graffiti crew.

This breathtaking image of a dolphin leaping out of the water is painted on a building in Melun, in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris

He said: 'Life always give one troubles but my work gives me a lot of opportunity to face these troubles.  Any situation can arise when you work in the public space.

'But I hope I am creating illusions through my paintings that can be a switch for people's minds.'

He added: 'I like to express life-emotions and the environment, and use different artistic forms to speak.  I prefer people staring at my work without saying any words - it means they are taking it in.'
