Julie Gale was instructed to remove her headscarf in a crowded foyer at the Melbourne Magistrates Court in November last year 

A breast cancer survivor who was undergoing chemotherapy treatment was left humiliated after being forced to publicly remove her headscarf at a Melbourne court.

Julie Gale, from Brighton East in Victoria, was checking-in her bag and stepping through the metal detector at Melbourne Magistrates' Court in November last year when she was stopped by a security guard.

 The 51-year-old comedian and women's health advocate told Daily Mail Australia that she had been attending a court case to support her daughter, who had been the victim of an assault at Flinders Street Station.

'It was just another day for me, feeling a little uncomfortable and vulnerable about having to be in the same room as the person who assaulted her and smashed her head open,' Ms Gale said.

'I was just going about my business when the male security guard pointed at his colleague who said 'take that off,' pointing at my headscarf.

'I said, 'What, you want me to take this off? I have a bald head underneath'.

'He said 'yes, you could be hiding something'. I just said, 'you want me to take it off now?' and he said yes.

'I'm normally quite a strong person and would have said 'No. I'm not doing it here in front of everyone in the foyer', but I had just gone through chemo and it's not easy when you're standing there with three males surrounding you.

She was at the court to support her daughter who was the victim of an assault and claims she had never been asked to remove her head-wear on previous court visits 

'So I just pulled it off defiantly and said 'are you happy now?' I was just really affronted and I was happy to show my bald head to anyone, but at my own choosing, not when ordered in public.'

Ms Gale claims that she was never instructed to remove her head-wear during previous court visits. 

She later found out from a female security guard that she could have been offered a private room for the screening.

The same security guard also told her that the guard who instructed her to remover her scarf 'was new and was probably nervous'.

Since sharing her story on social media last week, Ms Gales has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents

The comments were posted on the cancer support group, Under the Red Dress Project, Facebook page

Furious, Ms Gale, who underwent a double mastectomy and five months of chemotherapy which she described as 'robbing you of your armour', wrote a complaint to the security company about the incident. 

Although she was not offered an apology, the general manager of the service responded by assuring her the matter had been investigated and that their process were being reviewed to ensure 'there is not repeat of any matter that may cause undue embarrassment'. 

'My main message is that all women across all sectors of the community - no matter what their headwear - should be treated with dignity and respect,' Ms Gale said. 

 

 

'I was not given the choice of a private screening and I want women to know they can request this, if it is not offered. Security is important and necessary - but being forced to remove a headscarf in such an insensitive manner is not acceptable.' 

Since sharing her story on social media last week, Ms Gale has been astounded by the number of cancer patients who have experienced similar humiliating incidents. 

Facebook user Jenni Wright, commented with her own experience at Melbourne airport when a security guard ignored his supervisor instructions and she remover he headscarf.

'He kept insisting that I remove it from my head so I did and when I did you could hear the intake of breath from everyone in the area,' Ms Wright wrote. 

'The supervisor quickly came over and apologised and then told me to continue on my way... I wasn't embarrassed about my bald head I just didn't think everyone around me needed to see it.' 

Although she was not offered an apology, the general manager of the court's security service responded to Ms Gale's complaint by assuring her the matter had been investigated and that their process were being reviewed to ensure 'there is not repeat of any matter that may cause undue embarrassment'
