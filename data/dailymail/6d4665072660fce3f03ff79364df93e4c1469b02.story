Nick Clegg prompted a row last night after issuing a provocative call for the separation of Church and State.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that while he agreed with David Cameron that Britain was ‘infused by Christian values’, he believed the Church of England should be disestablished.

His remarks are particularly sensitive since he is the chairman of the Privy Council, the formal body of advisers to the Queen.

Controversial: Nick Clegg, chairman of the Privy Council, said the Church and State should break for the first time since 1534. He proposed the Queen should be stripped of the title 'Defender of the Faith of the Church'

‘In the long run it would be better 
for the Church and better for people of faith, and better for Anglicans,
 if the Church and the State were to stand on their own two separate 
feet,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio.

His
 proposal would mean the Monarch being removed as the head of the 
Church, as they have been since 1534. The Queen holds the title of 
Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England.

The
 Prime Minister immediately rejected his deputy’s suggestion, insisting:
 ‘No I don’t want to see that, I think our arrangements work well in 
this country.

‘As I’ve said 
before, we’re a Christian country, we have an established church, and 
being a Christian country, I find other faith leaders and members of 
other faiths say that it makes us almost more understanding, more 
tolerant, more understanding of the role that faith and religion plays 
in our country.

‘And 
actually, faith organisations do an enormous amount in terms of 
supporting schools, supporting charities, helping to build what I call 
the bigger society.

‘So I don’t want to see what the Deputy Prime Minister has set out, it’s a long-term liberal idea but not a Conservative one.’ 

The Deputy Prime Minister made his proposal despite admitting that Britain is 'infused by Christian values'

The
 Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday backed Mr Cameron in a row with 
militant atheists over his Easter message insisting Britain should be 
more ‘confident’ and ‘evangelical’ about its status as a Christian 
country.

The Archbishop said
 it was a ‘historical fact’, whether people liked it or not, that 
British society and culture - from art and music to the health service 
and school system - was ‘earthed’ in Christianity.

He
 dismissed a warning from more than 50 public figures, organised by the 
British Humanist Association, that Mr Cameron risked sowing ‘alienation 
and division’ in society by championing Christian values.

The
 Most Rev Welby, writing on his personal blog, admitted that proof of 
the importance of Christianity to the UK could not be found in 
attendance numbers at church, which have continued to fall.

But
 he said the response to the Prime Minister’s assertion that Britain was
 a Christian country had been ‘all quite baffling’ but also 
‘encouraging’, since Christianity thrived amid ‘hatred and opposition’ 
rather than ‘comfortable indifference’.

A
 group led by the British Humanist Association, and including writers 
Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett and Guardian columnist Polly 
Toynbee, accused Mr Cameron of causing harm by emphasising Christianity.

The Prime Minister flatly rejected Nick Clegg's suggestion as Justin Welby defended the historical connection

The
 Most Rev Welby insisted who signed the humanist letter were ‘wrong’ to 
suggest that being proud of Britain’s ‘Christian identity’ excluded 
others.

‘Judging by the 
reaction, anyone would think that the people concerned had at the same 
time suggested the return of the Inquisition (complete with comfy chairs
 for Monty Python fans), compulsory church going and universal tithes,’ 
he said.

Communities 
Secretary Eric Pickles said he had been shocked by the backlash from 
atheists to his recent ruling that councils should be allowed to hold 
prayers before the start of meetings.

He
 said: ‘I am a Christian, but my little intervention was basically just 
to say “let’s allow people to have a prayer before a council meeting”. I
 would have been equally angry if people were forced to go to the 
prayer.

‘All I wanted to do 
was allow people, but on that basis the entire heavens have opened up - 
you would have thought I was some kind of ayatollah demanding people go 
to church when I was just trying to be a voice for moderation and 
reasonableness.’
