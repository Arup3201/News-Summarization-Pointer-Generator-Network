England's most encouraging performance against Italy came from the fearless 19-year-old Raheem Sterling.

But success was not always certain for a man whose teacher once warned: ‘You’ll either end up playing for England, or in prison.’

A surprise inclusion in Saturday’s line-up, the Liverpool winger was instrumental throughout.

Troubled past: Raheem Sterling, 19, went from a North London housing estate to being England's rising star

His transfer value is now thought to have reached some £30million, while his club is expected to more than double his £30,000-a-week wages to £70,000 when he returns from Brazil.

Such dizzying figures are a world away from his troubled youth on one of London’s toughest housing estates.

Sterling moved to St Raphael’s, in the shadow of Wembley Stadium, from Jamaica at the age of five with his mother Nadine and three siblings.

He was removed from mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems.

One teacher warned him: ‘If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be in prison or playing for England.’

As prophesised, Sterling made his England debut as a 17-year-old, two years after signing for Liverpool.

However, off the field he had already 
earned a reputation as a bad boy, fathering a daughter from a brief 
relationship at the age of 16.

Last year he was cleared of attacking 
19-year-old model Shana Ann Rose Halliday after she declined to give 
evidence against him.

He had already had a common assault charge against him dismissed after a witness failed to turn up to court.

Miss Halliday admitted starting the 
row with Sterling that led to him being charged.

‘We had a heated 
argument because I had seen a text on his phone and asked who it was 
[from],’ she said.

‘We were pushing and shoving, both of us, and I 
started it because I was trying to get his phone.’

As with most players, Sterling’s body is covered with tattoos. One piece of body art pays tribute to his mother, who has now moved from London to Liverpool to support his career.

The script on his bicep reads: ‘Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me, through all the pain and suffering.’

During a recent interview, he jokingly described her as his personal ‘Jose Mourinho’, in reference to the outspoken Chelsea manager.

Sterling told the BBC: ‘She’s a big part of my life ... she tries to have too much of a say sometimes. I try to listen to her, because most of what she says is right.

‘She’ll certainly tell me when I’m not doing something right. At other times she’ll say I’m not listening to her. There’s been a few clashes with her.’

Sterling did not escape trouble during the build-up to the World Cup, receiving a red card for a reckless challenge in a friendly against Ecuador.

Crucially, he kept his head in the heat of Manaus on Saturday night – and could yet guide England to the next round.
