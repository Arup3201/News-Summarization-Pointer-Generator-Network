In a move that wouldn’t look out of place in an Austin Powers movie, a student from Illinois has fitted a spider-shaped robot with laser beams.

The remote-controlled Death Ray Laser Drone Bot is fitted with a beam so powerful it can pop balloons and make paper and card burst into flames.

It was created by 20-year-old Drake Anthony who demonstrated the full force of his creation on his Styropyro YouTube channel. 

Illinois student Drake Anthony fitted a remote-controlled Attacknid robot with a laser diode that is fired from the spider-shaped drone and is capable of setting fire to paper within seconds, pictured

In May, 20-year-old chemistry student Drake Anthony created a handheld lightsaber.

A video of the gadget showed the invention cutting through paper, tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball.

The laser used was a 9mm 450nm diode powered by two 18650 Li Ion batteries. 

Anthony called the lightsaber The BEAST.

To build the device, Anthony, 20, modified an Attacknid robot.

An Attacknid toy traditionally fires foam darts and disks, can walk around, and is designed to battle against other robots.

By removing the top of the robot and tweaking the firing mechanism, Anthony was able to replace the foam thrower with a 2W blue laser diode. 

By connecting the laser to existing 
wires, Anthony was able to move the Attacknid using the robot's remote control.

This control can make the Attacknid walk, spin the lasers 360-degrees, and fire the laser at targets. 

In the video, Anthony demonstrates the power of the laser by firing it at a series of black balloons that each pop immediately.

He then fires the laser at a piece of paper, which bursts into flames within three seconds. 

According to Anthony: ‘I present my most terrifying laser creation as of yet - the remote controlled death ray drone bot!

‘This beast packs a potent 2W blue laser that fries anything in it's path. It can walk around and shoot its death ray at the touch of a button.’

Anthony posts videos under the username the DIY Laser Guy and has previously created other laser-powered devices.

For example, in May, the chemistry student from Southern Illinois University created a handheld lightsaber.

A video, created by Anthony, showed the invention cutting through paper, tape and cardboard - and even melting a ping pong ball.

This laser used a 9mm 450nm diode that was powered by two 18650 Li Ion batteries.

In a YouTube video, Anthony demonstrates the power of the 2W laser diode by firing it at a series of targets and setting fire to them, pictured
