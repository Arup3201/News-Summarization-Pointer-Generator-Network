Police stormed into a motel room in this seaside town Tuesday evening and captured a Washington state man suspected of killing his grandparents, ending a multi-state search and a tense daylong standoff at the motel.

'Everyone's safe. No one's hurt,' said Lincoln City Police Chief Keith Kilian.

Police had spent much of the day trying to persuade Michael Boysen to surrender. After breaching the motel room door, they stormed in and captured him.

Kilian said no shots were fired and Boysen offered no resistance.

Authorities have apprehended Boysen after he allegedly killed his 82-year-old grandfather and 80-year-old grandmother in their Renton, Washington home last week

Limited damage: Boysen allegedly cut himself during the ordeal and he had to be taken to a hospital

Kilian said Boysen had suffered from a self-inflicted wound, apparently a cut. He was taken away in an ambulance.

The bodies of Boysen's grandparents 
were found Saturday in their suburban Seattle home, a day after Boysen 
was released from prison and was greeted with a welcome home party.

During the siege in this tourist 
town, police pointed rifles at the motel, fired blasts from a water 
cannon and used a bullhorn to try to persuade Boysen to give up.

Boysen checked into the motel Monday 
night under his own name, but the name wasn't recognized until Tuesday 
morning when a desk clerk saw a television story about the case and 
called the Lincoln City police, Kilian said.

Boysen, 26, made threats against 
members of his family and law enforcement while behind bars, Corrections
Department spokesman Chad Lewis said Tuesday.

On guard: Police vehicles are seen outside of the Oceanfront Motel in Oregon on Tuesday as they tried for hours to coax Boysen out of his barricaded room

Prepping: Flash bangs and loud speakers were being used by police while they tried to get Boysen out of the motel room, which happened successfully Tuesday night

But authorities didn't learn of the 
threats until after the bodies of the grandparents were found and 
authorities had started looking for Boysen.

'Sources went to our staff at the Monroe Correctional Center and told us he had been threatening to do all this,' Lewis said.

The information was passed on to King
County deputies, and that's why King County Sheriff John Urquhart 
called Boysen extremely dangerous at a Monday news conference.

Three loud bangs were heard at the Westshore OceanFront Suites in this tourist town early in the afternoon.

Lincoln City's police chief says officers caused them, although he wouldn't elaborate on how exactly the noise was made.

Have you seen this car? Police are also searching for the victims' missing red, 2001 Chrysler 300, a photo of which they released today in a bid to track it

Before and after the bangs, police 
used a loudspeaker to try to persuade the person inside a room at the 
motel to disarm and surrender. The voice on the loudspeaker said, 
'There's a lot of people who want to see you come out OK.'

History: Michael 'Chad' Boysen was released from prison after serving nine months for a burglary charge

Police had sent a small robot up some stairs and onto a balcony of the motel before the blasts.

Boysen just finished serving nine 
months in prison on a burglary conviction, Lewis said. He had no violent
infractions in prison - 'nothing extraordinary,' Lewis said.

He served a previous sentence between 2006 and February 2011 for four robbery convictions.

Those convictions were related to an addiction to narcotic painkillers, Lewis said.

Boysen's grandparents picked him up 
from prison in Monroe on Friday, drove him to meet his probation officer
and to get an identification card from the Department of Licensing. 
They held a welcome home party for him Friday night.

The bodies were discovered by Boysen's
mother Saturday evening. She had been called by a family member who 
became concerned that the couple hadn't answered their door.

Authorities haven't said how they died. Investigators determined that Boysen had been searching the Internet for gun shows.

The motive for the killings remains unknown, King County sheriff's Sergeant Cindi West said.

Scene: The bodies of Michael 'Chad' Boysen's grandparents- Robert R. Taylor, 82, and Norma J. Taylor, 80- were found in this Renton, Washington house

'Between the family and detectives we have no idea,' she said.

'It's just bizarre. The family loved and supported him the whole time he was in prison.'

The King County medical examiner's 
office hasn't released their names. But family and neighbors told KOMO 
News they are Robert R. Taylor, 82, and Norma J. Taylor, 80.
