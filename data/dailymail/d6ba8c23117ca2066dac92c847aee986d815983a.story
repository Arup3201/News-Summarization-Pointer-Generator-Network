Dame Julie Mellor said patients often felt too scared to complain about their NHS treatments

Patients who suffer poor hospital care are failed because complaints go unheard and lessons unlearned, the NHS Ombudsman has warned.

Dame Julie Mellor said patients often felt too scared to complain about their NHS treatments.

She said: ‘What we found was that there is a toxic cocktail – patients felt reluctant to complain, because they can fear it will affect the care they get. If they do, they are met with a culture of defensiveness, where they don’t get the explanations they need and the opportunity is lost to learn really powerful insights.’

A report by the NHS Ombudsman is calling for sweeping changes so that more complaints are acted on quickly, and action is taken before care is threatened.

The changes include access to a free patients’ advice service 24 hours a day, each patient to be given the name of a senior person as the first port of call for concerns and a regular measure of feedback.

Ann Clwyd, a Labour MP whose husband suffered appalling failings in care, has submitted the recommendations to an independent review which is set to report next month.

Dame Julie told the  Daily Telegraph that hospitals often fail to learn lessons from even major tragedies, which were then more likely to be repeated.

More than half of those who consider complaining about their treatment by the NHS do not do so, according to research.

Many are put off because they expect the process to be bureaucratic, while others believe it will make no difference.

Patients and carers contacted the NHS Ombudsman in desperation and frustration, Dame Julie said, because hospital complaints departments had failed to provide even the most basic explanation, let alone an apology.

‘There are three core things that people come to us about,’ she said. ‘Number one is – “I just can’t get a decent explanation, I really don’t know what happened and actually maybe if I had a proper explanation that would sort it for me – I just want to know”.

‘The second is when something has gone wrong, but there is a lack of acknowledgement of mistakes, and inadequate apology.

‘The third is when there is insufficient remedy – I think what has really struck me about why the public complain is they do so because they want to prevent the same thing happening to someone else.’

A study by the Ombudsman also found staff are reluctant to properly investigate complaints because they are afraid of challenging the NHS hierarchy, drawing attention to failings or they are worried about being punished for admitting to failings.

 ‘This defensiveness is one of the most important things we need to overcome – that is about changing the culture, not about the procedure,’ Dame Julie said.

Last month Dame Julie promised a ten-fold rise in the numbers of cases which the Ombudsman examines.

A major review has called for NHS staff who ‘wilfully’ or ‘recklessly’ harm patients to face criminal penalties. It also demanded legal sanctions against NHS chiefs with a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude.
