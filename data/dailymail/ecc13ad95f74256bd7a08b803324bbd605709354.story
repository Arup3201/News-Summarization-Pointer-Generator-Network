Kim Sears turned out looking the picture of elegance to support boyfriend Andy Murray at Wimbledon yesterday in a green Victoria by Victoria Beckham dress.

The stunning artist, 25, came up top in 
the battle of the Wimbledon blondes, setting the tone for the day's 
tense match between Murray and Djokovic.

Her mint crochet dress, which comes up just above the knee, is worth £925 and is already sold out everywhere.

She accessorised it with her trusted nude Mulberry tote and beige woven platform sandals.

Holding her sunglasses and mobile phone 
in her hand, Sears strode confidently toward Centre Court to take her 
seat for Murray's final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia.

Murray kissed his partner of seven years shortly after making history, storming to victory against Djokovic.

The
26-year-old won in three straight sets, taking the first 6-4, the 
second 7-5 and the third 6-4 as millions around the country watched.

Murray, the British number one, kicked off the match on top form taking the first set 6-4.

As
Murray is successful in his life-long dream to win Wimbledon, he is now
the first Briton to win the Men’s Singles in 77 years.

Kim was at the forefront of the supporters in the players' box at All England Club's most famous court, while a tense-looking Judy Murray - the Scot's mother - was also courtside for the clash.

Prime Minister David Cameron, Hollywood heart-throb Bradley Cooper, and footballer Wayne Rooney also arrived to watch the Scot on Centre Court today as he takes on Djokovic.

It will be tough conditions for both 
Murray and Djokovic out on centre court as temperatures are set to soar 
to 30C (86F) in west London. The head court groundsman Neil Stubley 
suggested that the temperatures out on the court had topped 40C. 

So far during this tournament Kim has
worn outfits from Ted Baker, Whistles and Zara - all of which have 
experienced a subsequent surge in demand.

A Zara floral dress Kim wore on Monday sold out almost instantaneously.
