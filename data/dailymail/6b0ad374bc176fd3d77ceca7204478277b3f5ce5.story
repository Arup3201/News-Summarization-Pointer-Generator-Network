A couple of newlyweds were pulled over by the police on the way to their reception – when their driver sounded an illegal air horn.

Ali, 34, and Paul Bartlett, 43, from Weymouth, were on their way to their wedding reception after tying the knot in Portland Castle, Dorset, in a replica Dodge Charger.

The car, which was manufactured by the Dodge division of Chrysler, is a vehicle in the 80s TV show Dukes of Hazzard.

Dorset police pulled over and gave driver Wayne Duke, 34, a ticket for sounding an illegal Dixie horn which is stored under the car bonnet of the replica Dodge Charger

Newlyweds Ali and Paul Bartlett look out from the back of the replica Dodge Charger after they are pulled over by Dorset police on their way to their wedding reception because the driver sounded an illegal horn

It features a Dixie horn – a musical car horn – which was banned in the 70s.

Vintage car enthusiast Wayne Duke, 34, sounded the horn twice as he drove through the village of Wyke Regis in Dorset after some well-wishers indicated to the happy couple by pretending to pull a horn with their arms.

Groom Mr Bartlett, who is a carpenter, was stunned when he saw the police signalling to them to pull over.

He said: ‘We were shocked when we saw the police flashing their lights – and realised they were for us.

‘They must have been chasing us through a great deal of traffic to get to catch up.’

Police asked Mr Duke to open the bonnet so they could inspect the horn.

Mr Duke was taking newlyweds Ali, 35, and Paul Bartlett, 43, to their wedding reception in Dorset in the replica Dodge Charger from 80's TV show Dukes of Hazzard

The series, which ran from 1979 to 1985, featured Bo and Luke Duke, played by John Schneider and Tom Wopat, with Catherine Bach as Daisy Duke

Mr Bartlett said: ‘When he asked Wayne to open the bonnet it all started to look very serious.

‘I thought he was going to be given a warning I did not think it would be a full summons.'

The couple were allowed to continue their journey to the wedding reception.

Mr Bartlett said: ‘I have to say it did make a talking point at the reception and I think we will always remember the day when our wedding car was stopped by the police. They did not even apologise to Ali on her big day.’

Dorset police issued a summons for Mr Duke to attend court.

Mr Duke, from Wimborne, says he did not realise his Dixie horn was illegal.

He said: ‘I do have a normal horn but it’s such a fun car that everybody loves the ‘Dixie Land’ horn and beg me to sound it.’
