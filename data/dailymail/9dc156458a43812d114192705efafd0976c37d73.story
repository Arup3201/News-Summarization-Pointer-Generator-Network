Gang leader ‘Fat’ Andy Connors was buried yesterday in a gold-plated coffin said to have cost£25,000. 

Irish police feared there might be an outbreak of violence at the funeral and erected a tight-knit security ring around the Church of the Nativity in Saggart, west Dublin. The funeral passed off without incident.

Mr Connors was murdered in front of his wife and children last week.

Yesterday parish priest Fr Enda Cunningham told the hundreds of mourners that the Connors family wanted no retaliation for his death.

Fr Cunningham also said that the Lord would forgive ‘any sins’ the gang boss committed in this life.

Connors led a highly organised Traveller gang that travelled the length and breadth of Ireland carrying out burglaries.

While never directly involved in the robberies himself, he ‘directed operations’ and was ‘extremely wealthy’ as a consequence.

Mr Connors was buried at St Michael’s Cemetery, Gorey, Co. Wexford, following the funeral mass.

Investigating detectives have three main lines of inquiry. One is that he was shot dead by the IRA for refusing to hand over £40,000 protection money.

The second is that he was murdered by a well-known south Dublin businessman who was laundering huge sums of cash for him. The third is that he was murdered by other Traveller criminals in a feud.

The father of six was a major target of Operation Fiacla, an Irish police crackdown on burglaries nationwide.

He was also a target of the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau who wanted to seize some of his property. 

Connors built a £3 million mansion on the outskirts of Dublin which had its own indoor swimming pool. 

The house had five bedrooms and sat on 1.6 acres of land. 

Connors rented out up to 20 pitches on the land to fellow travellers to park their caravans for up to £100-a-week each.
