Cristiano Ronaldo would cost £1billion to lure away from Real Madrid, according to his super agent Jorge Mendes, who believes he will see out his career with the Galacticos.

The Real Madrid star is not only better than Lionel Messi, he is the best sportsman in history claimed Mendes, who has brokered some of the biggest transfers in European football.

‘He’s the most expensive player in the world because he’s the best footballer, the best sportsman ever in the world,’ Mendes told the BBC’s Dan Roan. ‘It’s impossible to say his worth. Cristano Ronaldo? One billion. His buyout clause one billion, so it is one billion.

‘If for any reason they decided to sell him tomorrow for £300m, someone would pay. He loves the Manchester United supporters because he was there six years he but he will finish his career at Real Madrid, for sure.’

Portuguese Mendes has risen from a DJ bar owner in Porto, where he became friends with many footballers, to one of the most powerful men in the game who has reportedly taken charge of transfers worth more than £1bn in total. 

He negotiated Angel di Maria’s £59.7m move to Manchester United and Diego Costa’s £32m purchase by Chelsea last summer. He also represents Jose Mourinho, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and David de Gea.

But Ronaldo, who moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid for £80m in 2009 is his most important client. 

That was a record-breaking transfer fee at the time but Mendes claimed it would not be long before a club paid £200m for a player.

‘Clubs like Manchester United or Real Madrid, if a player is worth £200m, of course they can do it,’ said Mendes, who also said players are worth even more than clubs are currently paying. 

‘The most important part of the game is the players,’ he said. They deserve the maximum amount possible. Of course there is a limit but you can pay until this limit. I think the limit may be in three years or maybe after that.’
