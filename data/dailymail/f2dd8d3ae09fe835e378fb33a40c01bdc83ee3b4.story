Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has tried to reassure fans that his players are not being distracted by talks of a potential sale of the club.

American billionaire Josh Harris has had discussions in recent weeks with Palace, who were rescued from administration four-and-a-half years ago.

When asked if the takeover talks had affected the team during the international break, Warnock said in a press conference: 'No, not at all. The lads never talk about it.

Josh Harris has visited Selhurst Park at least three times as he looks into buying Crystal Palace 

'They get on with their own preparation. [The takeover] will only happen if it is for the good of the club.'

The consortium which averted the prospect of administration guided Palace back into the Premier League.

After finishing 11th last season under Tony Pulis, the team is 17th heading into Sunday's home match against Liverpool.

Palace have lost four of their last five games, including a 1-0 defeat at Manchester United last time out.

Defensive woes have plagued the club, with Palace possessing the second leakiest defence in the competition having conceded 20 goals in 11 games.

Warnock says the players worked hard during the international break to improve.

'We have concentrated on the defence,' the 65-year-old said.

'You have to get clean sheets to progress in this league and that is what we will try to do in the next few weeks.'

Warnock is also hopeful that his team can be more clinical up front.

'We need to create a little bit more,' he said.

'The teams perhaps have found us a little bit predictable.

'We've had easy opportunities in the past games and we haven't been able to put them away. We have been unlucky but you cannot feel sorry for yourself.

'We have eight games until January and we are looking all around to see if we will improve our squad. But we have a good group.

'We just need more goals.'

Warnock also believes the club's famously vocal supporters are another important factor ahead of the Liverpool game at Selhurst Park.

'The fans were instrumental last season,' Warnock said.

'They were unbelievable home and away. It's the group of the fans we have.

'They are a special bunch. Even when playing away from home, you can hear them.

'It's fantastic for the lads. I think on Sunday it promises to be a good atmosphere again. We expect a packed house.'
