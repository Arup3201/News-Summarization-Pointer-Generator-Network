England Women got back to winning ways with a 42-13 Six Nations victory over Scotland on Friday night.

After defeat to Ireland two weeks ago in Ashbourne, the world champions were in more convincing form and Ruth Laybourn led them to an eight-try victory with a hat-trick.

England were ahead inside a minute with Katy McLean, Ceri Large, Fiona Pocock and Lydia Thompson all combining to allow Laybourn to touch down.

McLean missed the conversion and a Nuala Deans penalty cut the deficit before Tamara Taylor barged her way over after a nicely floated McLean pass.

Lisa Martin booted another Scottish penalty but two further tries before the break from Justine Lucas and Rochelle Clark put England in control with a 14-point lead.

Bianca Blackburn and Harriet Millar-Mills put Pocock over in the second half but Eilidh Sinclair replied for Scotland, with Deans adding the conversion.

That was as good as it got for the Scots, though, with Laybourn adding her second on 56 minutes before Thompson went over with Amber Reed adding the extras.

Laybourn then crossed over for her hat-trick to seal a comfortable England win.
