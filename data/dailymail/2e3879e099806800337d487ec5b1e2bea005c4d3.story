A man has been convicted of murder and other charges after the decomposed bodies of his two roommates were found behind a Los Angeles home. 

Brent Zubek, 46, was found guilty on Tuesday of nine felony charges, including two counts of murder and six counts of assaulting a police officer, The Los Angeles Times reported.

John David Lee, 40, and 28-year-old Oletta Jean Williams had been dead for six weeks before their remains were found on Aug. 12, 2011, in the Chatsworth area. 

Both had been shot several times.

A police search for Zubek lasted 10 days and he opened fire on police before his arrest.

Zubek represented himself during his trial. 

He could face life in prison without the possibility of parole along with nine life terms. 

Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. 

Zubek also has a previous bank robbery charge against him from 1993.
