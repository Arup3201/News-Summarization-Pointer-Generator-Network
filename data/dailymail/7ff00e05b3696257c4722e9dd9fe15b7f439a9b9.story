A prostitute has told a court of the moment her 'boyfriend' - and father of her child - shot dead a client, who was the grandson of Henry Ford.

Dijana Kilic took the stand as the key witness connecting Danyell Thomas, 36, to the murder of John Dahlinger, 56, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in October last year.

She told the jury at Kent County Circuit Court yesterday that Thomas - who also acted as her pimp - broke into her client's home, fired a shot and later confessed to shooting the victim in the head.

Thomas denies murdering father-of-two Mr Dahlinger after he was unable to pay for Ms Kilic's services.

If convicted, Thomas faces life in prison without parole for felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm. 

She described the 'sexless' encounters with Mr Dahlinger that led to his death, reported Michigan Live.  

'I wasn't really thinking that day,' she said.

'I didn't really believe he'd come in with a gun.'  

Jurors heard Ms Kilic met businessman Mr Dahlinger, in the fall of 2013 when she saw him smoke crack in a group at a Northeast Side trailer park - and then again on October 8 after he contacted her through an ad online.

Ms Kilic said he paid her nearly $1,000 for her time when they met at a hotel on 28th Street - but all they did was talk and use drugs. She admitted trying to slip a drug in his drink, but he did not pass out.

In court, Ms Yanchuk wept as said she far as she knew Dahlinger, a father-of-two, did not use drugs or prostitutes

And when she met him a second time on October 16 - the night Mr Dahlinger died - it was Thomas who drove her home afterwards.  

This time, she gave him heroin with the hope he would pass out, but as she modeled underwear for him, he asked her to perform a sex act with a friend while he watched. She said she refused.     

During the encounter, she exchanged numerous text messages with the accused, who asked her repeatedly if Mr Dahlinger had money - indicating the pair planned to rob Mr Dahlinger and anyone else at the property.

The texts allegedly sent from Ms Kilic suggest that Mr Dahlinger was waiting for one of his sons to bring money. 

And many of the messages from Thomas ended with the phrase 'FTP 2014' - which Ms Kilic said meant 'F*** the police'. 

She said Thomas then came in with a gun and pointed it at both her and at Mr Dahlinger.

She claims she ran out of the room and the heard a single gunshot after Mr Dahlinger said the words: 'I didn't do anything'.  

As they drove home, she told the court Thomas confessed to the shooting, but said it was accidental. 

They then visited the Gun Lake Casino in Wayland in a bid to establish an alibi for the time of Mr Dahlinger's death. 

Ms Kilic told the court she began working as a stripper at the age of 20 and later stepped up to prostitution

In the messages shown to the court, the accused asked her repeatedly if Mr Dahlinger had money - indicating the pair planned to rob the businessman 

The pair were arrested two weeks later and Ms Kilic's fingerprints were found all over the scene of the crime.  

Despite Thomas's please, Ms Kilic co-operated with the police and accepted a plea deal - which led to Thomas being charged with felony murder.

After pleading guilty to armed robbery, she was sentenced to one year in prison - but only spent a few months in Kent County Jail, and agreed to testify against Thomas. 

She helped police officers recover a .357 magnum allegedly belonging to Thomas from a river - which was linked to bullet fragments recovered at the scene. 

As part of the plea agreement, her testimony cannot be used against her.

The court heard she began working as a stripper at 20 and later moved to prostitution using a website where she would meet up with men.

She insists she never had sexual intercourse with her client - even though her adverts claim she was 'very open minded' and 'aimed to please'.

She said Thomas, who she lived with in North Wyoming, was OK with her sex work under those conditions.  

According to the Kent County Prosecutor's Office, part of the plea also deal included allowing Ms Kilic, a Bosnian immigrant, to stay in the country. 

Soon after the homicide, Ms Kilic found she was pregnant by Thomas and gave birth to his son.

Mr Dahlinger's late father has always claimed he was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford following an alleged affair the car manufacturer had with his young secretary. 

The victim's mother, Barbara Dahlinger - who was married to John Sr. - has previously confirmed the claim.

'Yes, my husband was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford,' she told Detroit News.

'So what if it's true? Everybody knew it back then.

'I lived it. My son lived it. And there's nothing to be gained by rehashing all this again. The Ford Motor Co. owes us nothing.'
