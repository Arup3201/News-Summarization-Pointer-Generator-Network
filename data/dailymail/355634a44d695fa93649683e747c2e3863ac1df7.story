A six-year-old British boy was last night named as one of the victims of the worst school shooting in American history.

Dylan Hockley, whose family moved to Connecticut from Hampshire two years ago, was one of 20 children murdered by ‘deeply disturbed’ Adam Lanza in what may have been a revenge attack.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Dylan’s parents, Ian and Nicole Hockley, lived almost opposite the house Lanza shared with his mother Nancy, whom he also killed.

Tragic: Dylan Hockley was one of 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut

Devastated:  Dylan’s grandmother told how the family had moved to America for a better life for Dylan and his eight-year-old brother Jake, pictured wearing purple top,  who survived the massacre at the school

Last night, Dylan’s devastated 
grandmother  Theresa Moretti told how the family had moved to America 
for a better life for Dylan  and his eight-year-old brother Jake, who 
survived the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

She said: ‘They chose that town to 
live in specifically because the school was so good. My daughter told 
me, “It’s safe and lovely here Mum.”

On Friday I was out buying 
Christmas presents for Dylan and his big brother Jake who is eight. I 
got a garbled message on my answerphone from my daughter. She was almost
incoherent.

‘I called her back and she told me 
what had happened. She kept saying “Mum, how do you tell an 
eight-year-old his six-year-old brother is dead and not coming back?”

‘Jake was at school that day. He heard the gunfire that killed his brother.

‘The family isn’t doing well. They 
have not seen Dylan yet. They are making funeral arrangements and 
waiting for his little body to be released to the funeral home.

‘They are in their house. They live 
almost opposite the murderer and his mother. Why did he have to shoot 20
innocent babies? They were only six and seven years old.

‘Dylan was a lovely boy. He had dimples and blue eyes and a mischievous grin,' said his grandmother

‘Dylan was a lovely boy. He had 
dimples and blue eyes and a mischievous grin. He loved playing Wii and 
they had a trampoline in their garden.  He loved garlic bread and his 
brother. We are shattered and will never be the same.’

‘When I spoke to Nicole, I said: ‘Do 
you know him? Did you know the mother?’ She said, ‘No, mum, I saw them 
but never spoke to them. I didn’t know them. I didn’t know there was a 
killer in my street’

Earlier this year, Mrs Hockley told 
how she and her husband Ian had  settled in scenic Newtown, an hour’s 
drive from New York, because ‘we felt happy and comfortable’.

Adam Lanza, a troubled 20-year-old loner with a 
history of autistic behavior, is the monster behind a horrific shooting 
at a Connecticut elementary school

Originally from Rhode Island, Mrs 
Hockley spent 18 years in England, marrying her British husband, who 
works for IBM in New York, in Norwich in 1993. Both Dylan and Jake were 
born in the UK.

All the child massacre victims were 
first-graders, aged six or seven. Seven adults, six women who worked at 
the school, plus Lanza’s mother, also died at his hands, before he 
killed himself.

The day before his killing spree the 
20-year-old ‘Goth’ was reported to have visited the school – where he 
had been a pupil at least a decade ago – and had an ‘altercation’ with 
four members of staff.

Three of those four are now among the 
dead. The fourth person was not at the school on Friday when he went on 
his rampage and is now being interviewed by police.

However, it was still not clear 
yesterday precisely what caused Lanza, a socially awkward loner, to 
snap, though detectives said they had found ‘clues’, thought to be 
emails, at his mother Nancy’s home, where he lived.

A grey-haired man who was laying 
flowers outside the school described the Hockleys as a ‘very nice 
family’ adding: ‘They fitted in this community perfectly. We were close 
friends, like family.

Adam Lanza shot his mother, Nancy, before driving to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting 26 people including 20 children

‘We found out last night. They called us and said just a few words, “Our son is not with us any more”. That’s how it happened.’

As police released the identities of 
all the victims last night, it  was confirmed that they were all shot 
several times by a semi-automatic rifle.

Medical examiner Wayne Carver, said he examined seven of the children killed, and two had been shot at close range.

When asked how many bullets were fired, he said: ‘I’m lucky if I can tell you how many I found.’

Police said they had found ‘very good 
evidence’ they hoped would answer questions about the motives of the 
20-year-old gunman, described by those who knew him as brilliant but 
remote.

Witnesses said Lanza didn’t say a word during his murderous spree.

And investigators said they found no 
note or ‘manifesto’ of the sort they have come to expect after murderous
rampages. Just one person, a woman who worked at the school, was shot 
and survived – an unusually small number in a mass shooting – and police
lieutenant Paul Vance said her testimony would be ‘instrumental’ in the
case.

Traumatized students were seen being led out of the school crying and holding hands

A Glock and a Sig Sauer, both pistols,
and a .223-calibre Bushmaster rifle were found in the school and a 
fourth weapon was found outside. It has also emerged that, on Tuesday, 
Lanza tried to buy an extra rifle to bulk up his arsenal at local 
sporting goods store, Dicks, where semi-automatic rifles are priced as 
low as $49.98 (£31).

Inevitably, the question of America’s liberal gun laws has been raised by the massacre.

The family of the gunman last night branded his actions ‘incomprehensible’.

James Champion, a police officer in 
New Hampshire and brother of Lanza’s mother Nancy, said via a statement:
‘Our whole family is devastated. Nancy was a wonderful, loving mother.’
