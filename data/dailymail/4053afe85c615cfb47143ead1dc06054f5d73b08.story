Billed as a popular entertainment programme, you might expect Britain’s Got Talent to be, well, entertaining.

But the show is facing a backlash from its fans after viewers branded the semi-final ‘mind-numbingly boring’.

Around a million of the programme’s followers deserted it on Tuesday night, following days of complaints about lengthy advert breaks and the number of foreign acts allowed to compete.

'Mind-numbingly boring': A picture tweeted by Amanda Holden shows David Walliams and Simon Cowell during yesterday's Britain's Got Talent semi-final number three, which was watched by a million fewer viewers

The episode, which saw singer James Smith and dance troupe Addict Initiative put through to the final, was watched by 7.8million viewers – more than a million less than the first semi-final on Monday.

Over the course of eight years, the likes of Susan Boyle and Ashleigh and Pudsey have found fame on the variety show.

But as one viewer put it on Tuesday: ‘BGT has totally had its day!’ Another wrote on Twitter: ‘Britain’s Got Talent is sooooo mind-numbing #Snooooooze.’

And several even suggested that the  programme should be renamed ‘Britain’s scraping the barrel’.

The ratings slump will come as a blow to ITV bosses, who had hoped that this year’s format shake up – which saw the addition of the judges’ ‘golden buzzer’ which can catapult acts to the semi-final – would draw in more viewers.

James Smith won the public vote, while the judges – Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams – chose Addict Initiative over singer Jodi Bird to go through as well.

Canadian magician Darcy Oake and singing group Collabro went through on Monday night. And the remaining six places in the final will be filled throughout the course of this week, from a total of 45 semi-finalists.

Earlier this week Britain’s Got Talent was hit by fury from fans, when they discovered almost 20 minutes of the 90-minute semi-final on Monday was being taken up by adverts.

Taking to Twitter, one wrote: ‘Britain’s Got Talent has more adverts than acts! Sort it out #ITV #BGT becoming a bloody joke.’

And in recent weeks the programme has faced criticism about the number of foreign acts to get through the auditions.
