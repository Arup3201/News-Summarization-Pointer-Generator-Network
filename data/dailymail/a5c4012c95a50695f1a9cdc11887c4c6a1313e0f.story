O Chul, 39, from Korea said the lights were so bright he only needed a 1.3 second exposure on his camera to capture them, adding that fellow tourists cheered as the lights danced across the sky. 

He said: 'Before they started I could just feel that something great was going to happen.'

'So I had set my camera as continuous mode and started shooting. It turned out my prediction was right.'

He added: 'The auroras were so bright that they not only inspired awe, but were easily visible on an image exposure of only 1.3 seconds.

'Tourists, many there just to see auroras, respond with cheers. The conical dwellings on the image right are teepees.'

Aurora borealis - or aurora australis if seen in the southern hemisphere - is a natural light show, especially seen in the high latitude Arctic and Antarctic regions, such as Norway and North Canada.

The flourescent bands of light are produced by the collision of charged 
particles from Earth's magnetosphere, mostly electrons but also protons 
and heavier particles, with atoms and molecules of Earth's atmosphere at
 altitudes above 80 km.

The particles originate from the Sun and reach the Earth in the stream of solar wind.
