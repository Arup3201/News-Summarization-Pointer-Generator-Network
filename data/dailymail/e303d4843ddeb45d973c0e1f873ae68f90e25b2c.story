This tiny Pygmy owl had a hoot as it dived into snow, leaving just its head and wings poking out.

As part of the smallest species in Europe the owl, which measured about 7in from tip to tail, used its lightning-speed reactions to catch a vole hidden in the deep bank in Oulo, Finland - emerging with the creature after just 15 seconds.

The sequence was captured by photographer Jari Peltomaki, 48, as part of a new book about the birds.

Mr Peltomaki said: 'The Pygmy owl was
 looking down intensively for about 30 seconds - obviously it heard a 
vole under the snow - then it very quickly dived in to the deep soft 
snow, very close to me.

'First its head was under the snow when it was looking for vole and it was almost completely covered.

'The whole hunting sequence lasted 15 seconds and the owl looked very satisfied when it flew off with a vole.

'I was thrilled to witness and capture this scene on camera.'

Mr Peltomaki's photographs have depicted owls hunting, nesting and even apparently giving the photographer a cheeky wink.

In one extraordinary photo, a female Tengmalm's owl stared straight at the camera lens with one eye closed as she stared out through a gap in a tree trunk.

Mr Peltomaki achieved the shots by putting up hundreds of nesting boxes in the forests of his native Finland and staking them out until the birds arrived.

The photos are part of the new book Owls

He said: 'These nest boxes are definitely 
beneficial for the owls in commercially harvested forests, where there 
aren’t many natural woodpecker holes.

'Tengmalm’s owls appreciate the nest boxes and other owl species nesting in my boxes include Pygmy owls, Ural owls, Hawk owls and Great Grey owls.

'It is easy to check if the nest box is occupied. You just need to give the tree trunk a little scratch and their head will pop out immediately.'

Mr Peltomaki’s photographs feature in 
his new book Owls, which has just been published with photographer and 
friend David Tipling.

Of the 'winking' photo, he said: 'This female stayed at the hole for couple of minutes and, while I was slowly walking around and looking for different angles, I saw it suddenly winking its eye. It looked really funny!

'It was like the owl was telling me: "thank you for putting up this nest box for me".'
