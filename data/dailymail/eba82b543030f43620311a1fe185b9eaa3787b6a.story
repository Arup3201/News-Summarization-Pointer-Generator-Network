A bicyclist in Brazil was hit by a passing truck on Monday, but was spared a potentially deadly injury when, unimaginably, a poorly secured mattress fell from the truck that hit him, beat the man to the ground and somehow cushioned his fall.

In a twist, the incident just happened to take place right in front of a driving school.

Security cameras in front of the driving school in Foz do Iguacu, in western Parana, Brazil, captured the entire incident.

When he finally came to a stop, the bicyclist was safely on top of the mattressÂ 

Footage of the near-death experience has since gone viral, tallying more than one million views on Youtube.

According to the Brazilian website G1, the incident happened Monday afternoon on one of the busiest streets in the city.

The website reports that the unnamed bicyclist was uninjured in the bizarre collision.

After the man gets up, he looks around for his bike and realizes it's underneath the mattress that broke his fall
