The remains of a 59-year-old man have been found six miles from a Nevada town after he vanished 18 months ago while looking for help when he and his wife became stranded.

Albert Chretien's body was discovered on a mountain near the Nevada-Idaho state line on Saturday by hunters.

Mr Chretien and his wife Rita had set out from their home in British Columbia, Canada, to a Las Vegas trade show in March 2011 when they became catastrophically lost.

The couple became stuck in a remote area when their GPS system led them on to a back road. While Mr Chretien disappeared trying to find help, his 56-year-old wife was found 48 days later close to death after surviving on trail mix and snow.

Elko County Sheriff's Deputy David Prall said Mr Chretien was within six miles of Mountain City, but his GPS battery likely failed and he began walking too far north, facing uphill into the deepest snow.

Prall said that it took a courageous man to make it as far as Mr Chretien did.

Authorities said they were able to identify the 59-year-old using the wallet and business cards found on his body. The news offered a measure of relief and closure to his family.

'She's obviously upset but she's also relieved that we recovered Albert's remains,' Detective Jim Carpenter told CBC News.

In an email to CBC, Mr Chretien's sister Lorraine Hoving said 'it does open the wound again, however, to the emotions,' but that his family were thankful for the news.

'It appears he went peacefully, which we are so thankful for … Apparently, it snowed hard that night so he must have simply laid down and went to heaven,' Ms Hoving wrote.

'We are all holding up fine, we are experiencing a great sense of relief and [are] thankful for closure.'

Mr and Mrs Chretien had planned to make a rest stop at the small town of Jackpot on the Nevada border and consulted the navigational system for the quickest route from Oregon.

Unfortunately this led them through a treacherous mountain range for which they were woefully ill-equipped.

Their ten-year-old Chevrolet only had front-wheel drive and soon became stuck in the mud. Mr Chretien set out on foot after three days to get help.

Chad Herman, one of three hunters who found Mrs Chretien, told emergency workers: 'She's about dead, and her husband took off about a month ago and never came back, so I'm sure he's dead.'

Mrs Chretien had survived for seven weeks by eating trail mix, boiled sweets and drinking water from a stream.

Mr Herman said the 56-year-old was 'really weak' when they found her and that she had draped 
colourful blankets from the van's windows to attract attention.

A helicopter was sent to airlift Mrs Chretien to hospital in Twin Falls, Idaho, as it was 
considered too risky to try to reach her by road.

She was released from hospital and returned to her home in British Columbia with her 
family for further treatment.

One of the couple's three sons, Raymond Chretien, said the family was 'stunned' their mother had been found alive.

He said she had lost 20-30lb during her ordeal. Raymond Chretien said: 'I don't believe they were prepared for winter weather. They don't go camping.'

A search and rescue team, with 20 
volunteers on horseback and several all-terrain vehicles, continued to cover a wide search area looking for Mr Chretien for the following days to no avail.

Sergeant Kevin McKinney, spokesman for the Elko County Sheriff's Office, said the search also involved one plane.

The Chretiens were last seen on CCTV on March 19 when they stopped for fuel and supplies 
at a petrol station in Oregon.

The couple appear to have turned their van off a main road in southern Idaho or 
north-eastern Nevada near Mountain City.

The area in which the Chretiens were traveling is known to be particularly dangerous and inhospitable during the winter months.

Bill Landon, who lives in Mountain City, said: 'Them mountains are nasty, some of the gnarliest mountains you ever seen.

'The mud up there is something terrible.You sink up to your knees in it. When it rains back there, those roads turn to plumb mush.'

Mel Basanez, a 74-year-old retired 
grocery shop owner who has lived in the area all his life, said the 
journey that the Canadian couple had attempted was a big risk.

He said: 'I can't imagine getting off the highway in this country at that time of year. The minute the guy got off the highway, he should have realised he was in trouble.'

By typing Jackpot into the van's GPS, the shortest route leads off the main road and along a network of forest roads labelled only with numbers.

Sgt McKinney said: 'I'm no expert on GPS devices and how they work, but if you plug in for the shortest distance to any location it'll give you that, but that's not always the best way to go.'

Ryan Stowell, who lives in the remote mountain area, said: 'I think that GPS really screwed them up.

'There's no reason for us to be up there, unless we go up there to see if the road is open to Elko.'

The couple's pastor said Albert Chretien had recently bought the GPS unit. Revered Neil Allenbrand said: 'They planned to use it basically to get around Las Vegas.'

He described Mr Chretien, the owner of an excavating business, as 'a bit of an adventurer at times'.

Blindly following GPS units has led several drivers into life-threatening situations in the past.

In December 2009, a couple from Nevada were stranded for three days in the Oregon desert after they followed directions from a navigation device.

The following January, an Oregon couple spent 12 hours stranded in the Cascade Mountains near Washington with their 11-month-old daughter.

Mike Ferguson, author of guidebook GPS Land Navigation, said many inexperienced travellers put too much trust in devices and don't use their common sense.

Mr Ferguson said: 'Unless you're prepared for it, with a four-wheel drive, or maybe a snow machine in winter, when it sends you off into remote terrain, it can surely get you into big trouble.'
