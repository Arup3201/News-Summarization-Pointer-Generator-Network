A mother has told of her heartbreaking victory in a landmark court case which allowed her to end the life of her severely disabled daughter.

Twelve-year-old Nancy Fitzmaurice was born blind and unable to walk, talk, eat or drink unaided. She suffered from meningitis, septicaemia and fluid on the brain.

Before the right-to-die ruling – a first for a child without a terminal illness and not on life support – her mother Charlotte wrote in a statement to the court: ‘My daughter is no longer my daughter.

Nancy Fitzmaurice's mother, Charlotte (right) , has spoken of the heartbreak of letting her disabled daughter die

Ms Fitzmaurice, 36, gave up her job as an NHS nurse so she could stay by her severely disabled daughter's side

Nancy was born blind and suffering from fluid on the brain, meningitis and septicaemia, which left her unable to talk, walk, eat or drink

‘She is now merely just a shell. The light from her eyes is now gone and is replaced with fear and a longing to be at peace.’

Miss Fitzmaurice, 36, added: ‘Today I am appealing to you for Nancy as I truly believe she has endured enough. For me to say that breaks my heart. But I have to say it.’

The judge granted the request in August and Nancy died 14 days later.

Her case saw London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital – which had provided her with round-the-clock care – fight on behalf of the girl’s parents to give them the right to end her life.  

The ruling sets a precedent as it is the first time a child breathing on their own and not suffering from a terminal illness has been allowed to die.

Miss Fitzmaurice, who had given up work as a nurse to be her daughter’s carer, said: ‘Nancy was screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day and it broke my heart to see her like that.

‘Not being able to help her or ease her suffering was too much to bear.

‘She wasn’t my angelic child any more, she was just a shell. I wanted to have beautiful memories of Nancy, not soul-crushing ones.' 

Doctors only discovered that Ms Fitzmaurice was carrying Group B Streptococcus two days before Nancy was born. If they had known earlier, they could have easily treated the baby while she was in her mother's womb

After a routine operation went wrong, leaving her daughter in agonising pain, Ms Fitzmaurice and Nancy's father, David Wise (right), took the decision to let her die

Nancy's quality of life was so poor that she depended on round-the-clock hospital care and was fed and watered through a tube

She added: ‘Sitting at her bedside and holding her hand, it killed me that there was nothing I could do to help her. All of the nurses were in tears as they witnessed her screaming and doubling over in pain.

‘All I wanted was for my daughter to die with dignity with me by her side, holding her hand.’

Two days before giving birth in July 2002, Miss Fitzmaurice, from Ilford, Essex, was told her daughter was likely to be severely ill as she carried Group B Streptococcus.

If caught early the condition is easily treatable in the womb with antibiotics, but the mother-to-be was told that as it had gone untreated, it would harm her unborn child.

At ten days old, Nancy had to have a shunt – a small tube with a valve – fitted to drain fluid in her brain. 

A High Court judge ruled that Nancy, pictured being held by her grandmother Elaine Hewitt, should have her fluids withdrawn

The operation for kidney stones had left Nancy 'screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day', Ms Fitzmaurice said

Her illness was so severe doctors warned she would die before her fourth birthday.

Despite that outlook, Nancy survived far beyond the age of four. But a routine operation in May 2012 to remove kidney stones left her with an infection and specialists told her parents there was nothing more they could do.

She became immune to the strong pain relief cocktail of morphine and ketamine, leaving her in agony.

It was then that her mother and father David Wise met the ethics board at Great Ormond Street Hospital to beg them to put an end to Nancy’s suffering. While doctors agreed to stop feeding her, they were not able to withdraw all fluids and said it could take months for her to die. 

After her fluids were withdrawn by doctors, it took two weeks for 12-year-old Nancy to die

Ms Fitzmaurice misses her daughter every day, but says she knows it was 'the right thing to do'

Heartbroken: Ms Fitzmaurice said the 'absolutely horrifying' day her daughter died was the hardest of her life

The hospital agreed to take Nancy’s case to the High Court, to argue that she deserved the right to a quicker, less painful death.

On August 7 this year, Mrs Justice Eleanor King read Miss Fitzmaurice’s plea and declared it was in the mother and daughter’s best interests to withdraw fluids.

‘The love, devotion and competence of her mother are apparent,’ the judge said. ‘In her own closed world [Nancy] has had some quality of life.

‘Sadly that is not the case now. Please can you tell Nancy’s mother that I have great admiration for her, and please express my deep condolences to her.’ Nancy died two weeks later, on August 21, with her family at her side.

Her mother said: ‘The last day was the hardest of my life. It was absolutely horrifying.

‘I miss my beautiful girl every day and although I know it was the right thing to do, I will never forgive myself.

‘It shouldn’t have to be a mother’s decision to end their child’s life.’

Mr Wise, a 47-year-old businessman, added: ‘It was heartbreaking to see my daughter like that. Nancy never spoke so we never knew how she felt. She couldn’t tell us what she was going through and it was the hardest decision we’ve ever made.’
