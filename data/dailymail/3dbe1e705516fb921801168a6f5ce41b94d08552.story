A father has branded the masked gang who attacked his pregnant partner with baseball bats and a butcher's knife while she was giving birth as 'sick scum'.

Chris Miller, 33, said the five men who assaulted  Danielle Liddle, 22, had 'wrecked his family's lives' and that his partner was too traumatised to return home with baby Reggie.

The couple were preparing to leave for hospital when the gang smashed through the front window of their home in Basildon, Essex, with a crowbar.

Ms Liddle was slashed in the face with a butcher's knife and beaten with crowbars and baseball bats as her two-year-old son Kenzie slept upstairs.

She was rushed to Basildon hospital with a fractured skull and facial wounds, but gave birth to a baby boy despite her injuries.

Mr Miller, who was collecting his partner's hospital bag when the gang broke in, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for us both.

'My girlfriend remains in hospital with a serious head injury when she should be celebrating the birth of our child. 

He relived the moment the gang smashed their way into the home and appealed for help to find those responsible.

'My partner's contractions were about six minutes apart, so I went upstairs to get her hospital bag and to phone the babysitter to come and look after our two-year-old,' he said.

'The next thing I heard a loud smash - like a fish tank shattering.

'My partner started screaming my name and I just heard these men shouting something like 'where's the money?', 'give us the money!'.'

'I came down running down the stairs and they were attacking her. I just threw my arms round her to protect her.

'They carried on beating us. I was just shouting back at them, 'you are wrong man, she is in labour'.

'Me and my girlfriend just started screaming and shouting for help.

'I can't even describe to you how angry I am. My partner is too traumatised to even go back to our home.

'She is going to need counselling to help her get through this. To do this to a woman who is in labour - it's sick.'

Ms Liddle was ten days past her due date when she went into labour at 6am on Monday at her home in Pitsea, Essex.

Just before 9pm that night the contractions became more regular so Mr Miller started preparing a bag for hospital.

But while he was upstairs a gang of five men - three wearing balaclavas - broke into their terraced home.

They were heard shouting 'where is the money' and fled with just an iPad, Sony Experia mobile phone and £60 cash after the attack.

Ms Liddle's family say the 'strong and courageous' mum suffered flashbacks of the horrific attack while she was in a hospital delivery room.

Her sister Charlotte said: 'They attacked her with crowbars, baseball bats and cut her face with a butcher's knife.

'She was screaming for them to stop as she was in labour but this did not stop them. Luckily my two-year-old nephew was asleep upstairs and slept through it.

'My sister has had her face stitched but now discovered she may have a fractured skull.'

Police are now hunting the five men, all ages in their twenties with local accents, who broke into the home in Beambridge, Pitsea, on Monday night.

Three of the men wore balaclavas and dark clothes, a fourth gang member was white and the fifth was mixed race.

Detective Inspector Joel Henderson, from Basildon CID, said: 'This was a shocking attack on a young woman who was in labour. It is vital we get those people responsible off the streets of Basildon.'

Anyone with information can call Basildon CID on 101. 

A GoFundMe account has been set up my mother-of-two Joanne Ahrens, who is aiming to raise enough money so the young couple can rent a new house and install a good security system.
