Meet the Rowleys, a genetically blessed family where mother, father and all three childen all share model looks.

And they're making the most of their attractiveness: the family, from Warwick, have appeared in hundreds of adverts - including campaigns for Mothercare, Next, Argos, Aldi, Umbro and Centre Parks - getting paid up to £1000 a day to pose for pictures.

Father Anthony, 33, mother Kimberley, 
31, and children Tilly, five, Maisie, three, and Henry, 18 months, are an 
advertiser's dream - and collectively they make thousands upon thousands of pounds a year from their photogenic looks.

The family have so far appeared in adverts for Mothercare, Next, Argos, Aldi, Umbro and Centre Parks

The family - who are all signed to agency Source Models - were approached about modelling as a package after the birth of their second daughter and have been busy ever since.

Mother Kimberley says: 'I think we get booked a lot because we are a real mixed race family.

'It's
 nice that more mixed families are used now, as when I first started 
modelling it was always a white male with white female and vice versa.

Kimberley started modelling aged 13 and flew around the world for GHD hair tours, Ultimo lingerie shows and has also done shoots for Pirelli tyres, Alvin Loy couture and Playboy clothing before meeting her partner Anthony at the age of 21.

The mother-of-three said: 'I love my job, I get to travel a lot and made some great friends.'

'Now every shoot is like a family outing - it's great to spend time with the kids while saving money for their future.'

The Rowleys say that photo shoots are like a family outing

Father Anthony works as a professional footballer - but joins the family for jobs in between training and during his summer breaks.

The Luton Town player says he enjoys the change of pace and loves posing for the camera with his wife and three children.

The couple's eldest daughter Tilly was modelling while still in the womb when Kimberley bared her baby bump for Mothercare and Pregnancy and Birth magazine.

Since then Tilly has been the poster girl for Next, advertised for Umbro and has shot an Aldi commercial.

The youngest member of the Rowley 
family, Henry (right with mother Kimberley), was born last year and got booked for his first job for 
Mothercare at just 10 days old (held by older sister Tilly, left)

Kimberley said: 'I fell pregnant with Tilly when I was 24, suddenly my work changed and I was in demand for my baby bump.

'As soon as Tilly was born we were re-booked by Mother and Baby magazine for a shoot when she was three weeks old - she loved it and we got some fabulous shots of her first smiles.

'She loves modelling, really enjoys the attention and gets very excited seeing herself on TV.

'Maisie and Tilly get booked together as siblings and the girls loved it - we see it as a way to invest and save for their future.'

The youngest member of the Rowley family, Henry, was born last year and got booked for his first job for Mothercare at just 10 days old.

When the cute tot was six weeks old the Rowleys did their first job together as a family of five for Centre Parks Winter Wonderland.

'Companies tell us they like to use our real family as the children interact better with us as parents.'

David Gibbs from Source Models said: 'The Rowleys are one of the leading real model families in the UK.'
