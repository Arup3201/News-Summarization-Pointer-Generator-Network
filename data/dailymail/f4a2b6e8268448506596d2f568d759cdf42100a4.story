A Ukrainian man has appeared in court charged with the terror-related murder of a Muslim grandfather who was killed as he walked home from a mosque.

Pavlo Lapshyn, a 25-year-old postgraduate student, is accused of stabbing Mohammed Saleem, 82, to death in Birmingham.

The suspect is also accused of causing three more explosions outside mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton, all in the West Midlands, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

Lapshyn, wearing a black round-neck top with short-cropped hair, spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth and to request to speak to his lawyer during the 10-minute hearing today.

The student, who was in the UK on a sponsored work placement at a software firm based in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, was arrested on suspicion of Mr Saleem’s murder on July 20.

The pensioner was killed just yards from his home as he walked home after worshipping on April 29. The killing prompted an outpouring of grief from the community where he lived.

Investigation: A police forensic tent stands at the scene of Mr Saleem's murder in Small Heath, Birmingham

Victim: Mohammed Saleem, 82, who was stabbed to death in Birmingham

The stabbing of Mr Saleem, a 
highly-regarded and well-known figure in the local community, was 
described by detectives at the time as a 'despicable' attack on a 
defenceless pensioner.

A joint family statement read during a
press conference at West Midlands Police headquarters on May 2 
described Mr Saleem as 'a much-loved and respected community member'.

The statement read: 'We can’t express 
our feelings of sadness and devastation. It’s hard to accept that our 
beloved father and grandfather has been taken from us in such a brutal 
way.'

The court heard Lapshyn is also charged with carrying out a series of acts with the intention to commit acts of terrorism between April 24 and July 18, related to three separate explosions.

They include purchasing batteries, a lunch bag, clock and computer as part of the construction of an explosive device, carrying out internet research and visiting intended locations to plant explosive devices, purchasing chemicals to make explosive devices and modifying mobile phones to act as detonators, it is alleged.

Lapshyn is also charged with two separate offences of unlawfully and maliciously causing an explosion with the intent to danger life or cause serious injury to a person or property on June 21 and July 12, following the explosions in Walsall and Tipton respectively.

The defendant, of Dnipropetrovsk, eastern Ukraine, was remanded in custody and will next appear at a bail hearing at the Old Bailey on July 25.
