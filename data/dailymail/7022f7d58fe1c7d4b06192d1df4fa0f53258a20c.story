The funeral service for Bernard Jordan, the D-Day veteran who broke out of his care home for the 70-year commemorations, has been held today along with his wife's - after she died just a week after him.

Hundreds of mourners, including war veterans and RNLI members, packed St Michael and All Angels Church in Brighton, East Sussex, this morning to bid farewell to the couple, who were married for more than 50 years. 

Mr Jordan, who was known as Bernie, was 90 when he passed away on December 30 - six months after he earned the nickname of 'the Great Escaper' following his cross-Channel adventure last summer.

Service: The funeral of D-Day veteran Bernard Jordan, who broke out of his care home for the 70-year commemorations, was held this morning

Commemoration: It was a joint service for Mr Jordan and his wife Irene, who he was married to for 50 years, and died just seven days after him

Around 150 mourners gathered as Mr Jordan's coffin, draped in the Union flag and topped with his medals and a wreath of poppies, arrived at church in front of his wife, Irene's, who died a week later at the age of 88.

Assistant curate Father Mark Lyon, who led the service, said: 'It's a great privilege to give thanks for the lives of Bernie and Rene. Although Bernie made the headlines, it's a testament to the depth of her that Rene would not allow him to make this final journey alone.

'In this we can take comfort, knowing that they make their journey into eternity together, hand in hand.'

Mr and Mrs Jordan, who did not have children, had been married for 59 years and celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 2005. It emerged this week that the couple, who stayed in the same care home, left their entire £600,000 estate to the RNLI.

As a former mayor of Hove, the service was told Mr Jordan had been a long-serving community stalwart before his trip to last year's D-Day commemorations.

Paying tribute, Mr Fitch said Mr Jordan 'had a flare for being outrageous' and that Brighton and Hove had 'lost two of its dearest souls'.

He said: 'Bernie, in what were to be the last few months of his life, became a national and international figure due to his trip to France and his desire to participate in the Normandy Landings commemorations.

'What really captured the public's imagination was not his own scheduled flit from the Pines (care home) but the character of the man - a person determined to honour and value his comrades despite his increasing age and less than perfect health.'

Mr Fitch also paid tribute to Mrs Jordan as 'demure and quiet', adding that 'she was the perfect foil for her gregarious and big-hearted husband'.

Dennis Smith, the husband of one of the couple's nieces, told the service that the Jordans were 'different characters' who complemented each other. 

He said Mrs Jordan took a great interest in the Royal Family, particularly the younger generation and she acted as an 'assertive' figure, often keeping her husband grounded during his 'flights of fancy'.

He added that her death, just days after her husband, came as she 'saw little prospect of a life without him'.

After the Last Post sounded, Royal British Legion standard bearers lowered their flags before mourners filed out of the church ahead of a private committal.

Veteran Bernard Jordan was found in Normandy after travelling to France to mark the anniversary of D-Day. He is pictured shortly after his escapade (left) and during his time as a member of the Royal Navy (right)

Irene Jordan (pictured), 88, died on the evening of January 6 - a week following the death of her husband, Bernard, at the carehome they shared

The veteran sprang to prominence after sparking a police search when he left The Pines care home in Hove, telling carers he was going for a walk - but in reality he hopped on a ferry to France to go to D-Day events in Normandy.

He was wearing his war medals and a grey mac and his whereabouts emerged only when a younger veteran phoned later that night, on June 5, to say he had met Mr Jordan and he was safe. 

Royal Navy veteran Mr Jordan, an ex-mayor of Hove, told reporters on his return that his aim was to remember his fallen 'mates'. 

Speaking in interviews after his escapade, he described how he kept his exploit secret from his wife: ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss. I squeezed her hand and gave her a kiss.

'I told her, “You’ll miss me for a bit, but I’ll be back shortly.” Then I went downstairs and told the care home staff I was going out. I gave them a wave and just walked out.’

Mr Jordan had, in past interviews, referred to his wife as a ‘smashing woman’. 

A statement from Amanda Scott, managing director of Gracewell Healthcare which runs  care home where the couple lived, confirmed Mrs Jordan's death. 

Floral tributes laid inside the hearse with messages 'Rest in Peace Irene and Bernard'. His wife Irene died at the age of 88 on January 6

'Beloved sister and brother-in-law to the late Harold Moffatt. Sadly missed, by Joan, John and Louise,' reads one message placed on flowers

The Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan's decision to go to France highlighted 'the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation'

It said: 'Irene and Bernie will both be much missed by everyone at the home and our thoughts and prayers go out to their friends and family at this sad time.' 

Mr Jordan had decided to join British veterans, most making their final pilgrimage to revisit the scene of their momentous invasion, to remember the heroes of the liberation of Europe in June 2014.

Some 156,000 Allied troops landed on the five invasion beaches on June 6 1944, sparking an 80-day campaign to liberate Normandy involving three million troops and costing 250,000 lives.

Mr Jordan had hoped to return to Normandy this June. Brittany Ferries, which carried him across the Channel last summer, offered him free crossings to D-Day events for the rest of his life.

Following his death, the Royal British Legion said Mr Jordan's decision to go to France highlighted 'the spirit that epitomises the Second World War generation'.

On his 90th birthday, days after he returned from his escapade, he was inundated with more than 2,500 birthday cards from around the world.

Mr Jordan was later made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove in a special ceremony at Brighton Town Hall.

He joined an elite list to receive the honour, including Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, former Olympic champion Steve Ovett, and First World War hero Henry Allingham, who became the world's oldest man before his death aged 113 in 2009.
