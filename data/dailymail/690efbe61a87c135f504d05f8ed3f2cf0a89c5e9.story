Crafty designers have created some of the world’s most iconic food dishes - using Play-Doh.

Content marketer Joe Shervell and designer Chris Morley, from Southampton, created 40 traditional national dishes from around the world made entirely from the squidgy children’s craft products.

Joe and Chris, both aged 23, spent two days piecing the cuisine together, with a hearty bag of fish and chips representing England and Scotland's emblem being the haggis.

Unsurprisingly the traditional battered fish, chips and mushy peas, served on a page of newspaper, was chosen to represent England

Buzz, or steamed dumplings filled with mutton or beef, was the dish chosen to represent Mongolia

Sweden's dish of kottbullar - 
meatballs made with onion, egg, spices and herbs - were recreated in Play-Doh by Joe and Chris

Ceviche is a mix of fresh and raw fish cured in citrus juices, often served with chilli and peppers

The pair were commissioned by the Baltic Travel Company to craft the plasticine models, which also included an American hamburger and French crepes.

Joe said: 'We wanted to create something that cut through the noise of the thousands of infographics we see on the web each day to create something that celebrated multi-culturalism.

'Food seems to be the richest and most unique part of any culture, so we wanted to focus on that.

'We’d seen a news story about the game-changing Spanish restaurant ‘ElBulli’, which trained its staff in food presentation by getting them to practice with plasticine.

'The models took us a long weekend to create, and another week to photograph and design.'

Chris added: 'It was great fun and gave us a welcome opportunity to get away from the computers we spend so much of our lives working at.

'The internet is redefining design, and there’s a real opportunity for visual content to flourish.

'There is no reason for infographics and web content to be made from clip art and stock images.

'We hope to continue pushing ourselves to create visual content that is both informative and visually striking.'
