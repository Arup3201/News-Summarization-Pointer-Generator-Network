The wife of the $1m lottery winner who died of cyanide poisoning a day after collecting his jackpot today denied killing him - as a police source claims that she did not share his final meal.

Shabana Ansari frowned and told MailOnline: ‘No, certainly not’, when asked on Thursday if she was responsible for the death of Urooj Khan.

Meanwhile, a Chicago police source has claimed that she did not share his last dinner, the traditional Indian Kofta curry she prepared at their home in Chicago.

Distressed: Mr Khan's wife Shabana Ansari outside the home she shared with him on Thursday morning

Tough: Mrs Khan said today in the laundry store her husband owned that he was her 'courage and strength'. It was also revealed today that her father Fareeden Ansari, right, owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes

Urooj’s 17-year-old daughter Jasmeen, who lived with them, did not touch the meal either, the source told MailOnline.

A short time later, Urooj started screaming as the cyanide tore through his body, causing him an agonizing and horrific death. 

Asked about the final meal, Shabana said: ‘I don’t want to comment on the curry. I am fed up with all this. When I say something people are misquoting it so I don’t want to comment.’

Her comments seem to refer an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times earlier in the week in which she said that she had if fact eaten the meal.

She added that when she reads claims she could have been involved in her husband’s death 'I don't focus on it because I have not much to focus on, so I really don't care about those things’.

She said: 'It is a very difficult time. I've lost him.

'It's tough without him, it's really tough because he was my support and he was my courage and he was my strength.'

In another twist the Chicago Tribune today reported that her father Fareedun Ansari, who was living with them too, owed $124,000 in unpaid taxes and that as a result the IRS had taken out a lien on the property they were all sharing.

When MailOnline asked him about the money, Shabana intervened and said: 'We don't want to comment on this right now'.

Urooj, 46, died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the oversized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven where he bought the winning scratchcard.

Cruel death: Urooj Khan (pictured right) with his $1million winnings shortly before his death from cyanide poisoning. His wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) are by his side

He could not stop smiling and told the cameras he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning business which he had worked all his life to build up.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum.

When Urooj died, the initial toxicology tests did not find anything suspicious. It was not until a relative asked the Cook County Medical Examiner to take another look that the cyanide was found and the death was ruled a homicide.

Urooj’s body is expected to be exhumed in the coming weeks to carry out further analysis.

Shabana, 32, who moved to the US from India after marrying Urooj 12 years ago, was questioned by police for four hours and according to her lawyer Steven Kozicki ‘has nothing to hide’.

Investigators also searched her home but do not appear to have found anything incriminating. No arrests have been made so far.

The police source confirmed to MailOnline that Shabana did not eat the meal but did not elaborate on whether or not she watched as her husband ate it.

Legal battle: Meraj Khan (right) launched a legal battle to win custody of her late brother's 17-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (center). Unidentified woman, left.

In a potential source of tension in the family, the Chicago Tribune reported that Fareedun owed the $124,000 in unpaid taxes because of a small business he owned that appears to have failed

James Pittacora, who represents Fareedun, said that Urooj had helped pay for the business and that the two men were ‘very close’.

He said: ‘They had a very good relationship, and he and his daughter are devastated’.

Relatives have told MailOnline that, in a further sign of his generous character, Urooj took Fareedun into his home when he got sick a few years ago and urged him to move to Chicago from New Jersey to be with them.

The relative said: ‘Fareedun wasn’t well so Urooj took him in. All four of them lived together and Fareedun got well again. He was well looked after’.

The developments come after Urooj’s family went to war with Shabana amid claims she tried to cash the winning cheque in the days after his death.

Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal

Urooj’s brother ImTiaz Khan has alleged in probate documents that Shabana attempted to claim the windfall ‘shortly’ after his demise but for some reason was unable to.

ImTiaz also claimed his late brother and his wife were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on the 50 per cent of the lottery prize she would otherwise be entitled to. 

In response, Miss Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate.

In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan launched a separate legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter from his first marriage, Jasmeen.

Meraj successfully got custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with Shabana, her step mother, most of her life.

Agony: The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell'

And as a result of the filings, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for another three months.

The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organising how the funds will be handed out - normally it is 50 per cent to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for a complaint.

Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side

Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, Urooj’s sister Meraj Khan and her husband Mohammed Zaman said that the deceased was selfless and donated to an orphanage in his native India.

Zaman said that Urooj would turn up unannounced for coffee, was a keen cricket player and loved bringing presents to birthday parties for children in the family.

He said: ‘There is a way to go, a natural way.

‘We are born, we die. Not homicide. I don't want to see him a victim.’

Calls to Miss Ansari’s lawyer went unreturned.
