A mother has rounded on Nick Clegg over ‘mouldy’ sandwiches delivered to pupils under his free school meals scheme.

The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged during his radio phone-in by a caller who complained that sandwiches sent to her daughter’s school had ‘turned up frozen’ or with ‘mouldy bread’.

She said the sandwiches were part of ‘very unhealthy’ lunches which contained items such as doughnuts.

Nick Clegg vowed to investigate claims a school in Somerset was providing 'unhealthy' meals

Parents were being forced to send pupils to the school – St Joseph’s Catholic Primary in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset – with extra food to supplement their inadequate free meals, claimed the caller, named Nicola.

The revelations are embarrassing for Mr Clegg who has insisted his £1billion free meals scheme – which entitles all four to seven-year-olds to a free school lunch – will make pupils healthier and give them more energy to learn. 

But critics have argued that many schools are not equipped to implement the policy and that its benefits have been over-stated.

Mr Clegg admitted it was ‘totally unacceptable’ that pupils were being served poor quality food.

Nicola told him during the show on LBC Radio that a whole term into the free meals initiative, her daughter’s school still lacked the kitchen facilities to prepare hot food for pupils. Children were instead being offered cold packed lunches provided by a contractor.

She said: ‘The sandwiches are either cheese, ham, or tuna. There is no capacity for requests such as no butter, or whatever, if they don’t particularly like it.’

On one occasion ‘the sandwiches turned up frozen’ and on another ‘they turned up in mouldy bread’, Nicola said, adding: ‘Most parents I know are now sending in their children with additional food because they’re coming home hungry.’

The Liberal Democrat leader told her: ‘It sounds totally unacceptable and you are quite right as a mum to be immensely annoyed.’

He added: ‘If what you said is absolutely right, it hasn’t changed at all since the beginning of term, and that they are providing such poor value and poor quality cold meals, that’s completely wrong. 

The Deputy Prime Minister has championed the policy of free lunches for under-7s

Mr Clegg yesterday made mince pies with year 5 pupils from Hallfield Primary School in West London during a visit to announce take up figures for free school meals

‘It’s not what is happening across the vast majority of the rest of the school system.’

He promised to look into the case and ‘make sure something is done’.

A spokesman for St Joseph’s Catholic Primary said: ‘We have received no complaints about mouldy food.

‘On one occasion frozen sandwiches were delivered in error, but these were returned to the contractor and replaced with freshly made ones.’

They said the school is having a kitchen installed to provide hot meals, but that the current packed lunches ‘meet national guidelines’.

Mr Clegg’s on-air exchange with Nicola on Thursday came as he released figures showing that take-up of free meals is running at 85 per cent across the country.

But in the South East it dips to 81.5 per cent, with more children preferring to bring their own food.

Take-up was expected to be 87 per cent, but only three English regions reached this level – the North East, the North West and inner London.
