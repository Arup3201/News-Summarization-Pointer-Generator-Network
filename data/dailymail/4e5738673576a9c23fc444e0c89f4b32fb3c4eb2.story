Rangers fans last night reacted with horror to the prospect of Charles Green returning to the club as a front-man for American billionaire George Soros.

New York-based Soros is said to have told Green to make his move within the next seven days by offering shareholders 20p per share in order to become the club’s biggest shareholder.

If that move fails, it’s believed Soros and Green will offer the current board a £10million loan at five per cent interest, with the Murray Park training ground taken up as security over the deal.

Possible return: Green says he doesn't want to go back to Rangers, but claims he may have to soon

‘I’ve got a number of people ready to invest in Rangers,’ Green told the BBC. ‘I’ve told people this is a great club and a great opportunity. It’s one of the world’s biggest brands in terms of football.

‘I don’t want to go back to Rangers, I left unhappy last year and know it wouldn’t be right to go back. However, to see where the club is now is a disaster.

‘Why Charles Green? I’m not applying to be the Messiah but I won’t let the club continue to slide and become a laughing stock. What I’m saying is if someone else can raise the money then great - if not, I’ll do it.

‘It’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say how it is. I’ve made loads of mistakes I’m not saying I’m a good guy but I’m certainly not the worst guy.

‘I wouldn’t be involved at executive level or operationally but if I bring investors in, they’ll want some kind of representation on the board. That could be me or someone else.’

On the opposition from fans, Green added: ‘Raising cash is what I do. It’s what I’ve done for 30 years and it’s all I do. What is important is that the club is saved. If the club doesn’t raise cash, then it won’t be able to continue to trade.

‘If some fans would rather the club goes back into administration then they are not real fans. Sit and wait and see what happens - if I don’t raise the cash then that’s it but if I do the club will be stronger.

‘Rangers will get back to the Scottish Premiership and when they do, they need to be competitive. When they get there, no-one wants to see them weak and humiliated.

‘Fans need to unite. One week it’s the Sons of Struth and then the Union of Fans - there is no union of fans.

‘I’d love to see all the fans unite and hate me - at least then they’d be united. It’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say it how it is.’

Split: Manager Ally McCoist publicly fell out with Green last season, resulting in the CEO leaving the club

Green still has close links to the club via Sandy Easdale, the man to whom he is said to have sold his shareholding last year.

The Yorkshireman, however, is eyed with suspicion by a large section of the Rangers support.

Green and his cohorts, including finance director Brian Stockbridge, were seen to benefit greatly from huge remuneration packages that went some way to ensuring the £23m raised by a share issue in December 2012 quickly evaporated.

He left the club initially in April last year after a public spat with manager Ally McCoist and following his casual use of racist language - only to return three months later in a consultancy role.

Alleged business dealings with Craig Whyte damaged his reputation with the Rangers support and he left for a second time last August. Rumours that’s he’s still heavily involved behind the scenes and is close to a public return have lurked ever since.

Champions: Despite the off-field turmoil Rangers won the League 1 title last season comfortably

Last night the Union of Fans, the Rangers supporters umbrella group, stated it was unequivocally opposed to his return.

‘Simply put, Charles Green is not welcome at Rangers and we believe any attempt by him to return would see a huge number of Rangers fans seriously consider a full boycott of the club,’ a statement read.

‘Mr Green lied to the Rangers fans on more than one occasion. He presided over a period of mismanagement which has once again left the club on its knees financially.

‘At all times he acted in his own and his original investors interests and never in the interests of the club.

‘If he is indeed genuinely attempting to return then it will simply be to extract whatever more he can on behalf of the faceless investors he still represents.

Looking ahead: Rangers hope their stay in the Championship will be a brief stop on the way back to the SPL

‘It appears Mr Green is struggling to maintain his grasp on reality if he thinks Rangers fans will accept a further pillaging of the club by his clients.

‘We expect the board to completely rule out any attempt from any further associates of Mr Green to get involved with Rangers. We also expect them to confirm that no members of the PLC or “football” board have been involved in any attempt to bring further associates of Mr Green into the club. 

‘The £10m, even if it exists, is a sticking plaster on a gaping wound and made all the worse by Green’s record of syphoning any money invested in the club straight back out.’

Yesterday’s developments comes at the end of a week in which the board confirmed it hoped to raise £4m via a fresh share issue to cover a funding gap.
