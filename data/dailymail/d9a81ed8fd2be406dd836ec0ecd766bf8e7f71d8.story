Not a bird, not a plane, and no longer a reporter - comic book hero Superman has quit his day job.

The fictional superhero's alter ego Clark Kent, who has been working as a reporter on The Daily Planet since the 1940’s, leaves the newspaper business after becoming discontent with the state of 21st century journalism.

Instead Clark Kent is expected to start the next big online blog as a roving citizen journalist, according to writer Scott Lobdell.

In leaked pages from the forthcoming Superman issue, Clark Kent is getting an earful from Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White about not filing enough Superman stories.

This in combination with pressures from the multimedia corporation Galaxy Broadcasting, which now owns The Daily Planet, leads to Clark Kent walking out on his job.

‘This is really what happens when a 27-year-old guy is behind a desk and he has to take instruction from a larger conglomerate with concerns that aren't really his own,’ Superman writer Scott Lobdell explains.

‘Superman is arguably the most powerful person on the planet, but how long can he sit at his desk with someone breathing down his neck and treating him like the least important person in the world?’

Mr Lobdell said he doubts Superman will be offering his journalistic services at another Metropolis publication, but delve into the world of online blogging and citizen journalism.

‘He is more likely to start the next Huffington Post or the next Drudge Report than he is to go find someone else to get assignments or draw a paycheck from,’ Lobdell added.

The leaked pages from Wednesday's edition sees Superman's alter-ego having a discussion about the state of modern journalism with his editor Perry White and ex-wife Lois Lane, who is a producer for Galaxy Broadcasting.

Clark Kent says: ‘Why am I the only one who sounds like an ink-stained wretch who thinks news should be about, I don’t know, news?!’

His editor Perry White replies: ‘Go easy on us mortals, Clarke. Times are changing and print is a dying medium.'

After his editor delivers a line about giving the reader what they want, Clarke turns on his heel and walks out of the Daily Planet.

There was no immediate confirmation from Superman publisher DC Comics, itself part of the Time Warner multimedia empire, but Lobdell posted a link to the USA Today article on his Twitter account.

This is reportedly not the first time Clark Kent has left his reporting job, when Galaxy Broadcasting bought The Daily Planet in 1971, he had a short stint as a broadcaster before going back to his Superman beat for the paper.

The new plot twist is one of many to appear in Superman issue 13 which goes on sale tomorrow in both digital and hard-copy forms.
