Britain’s least used railway station recorded just eight passengers last year.

The total for Teesside Airport station, is even lower than the previous year, when 14 people passed through it.

There are just two trains a week, on Sundays – the minimum required by law to avoid closure.

Not needed: Less than 10 passengers passed through Teesside Airport Station in 2013. There are just two trains a week - both of which arrive on a Sunday

So remote 
and underused is the Teesside Airport station that even the local airport's website ignores it - despite it being less than a mile from the terminal.

The 
airport claims that: 'Darlington Train Station is the nearest train 
station to Durham Tees Valley Airport, located just 7 miles away.'

A Northern
 spokesperson said: 'The parliamentary service which calls at Durham 
Tees Valley Airport station is one which is specified in our franchise 
agreement.

'The line 
between Darlington and Middlesbrough has attracted a growing number of 
passengers over recent years, however the Airport station on the route, 
has not enjoyed the same success.'

Forgotten: Just two trains stop at Teesside Airport station a week - the minimum required by law. Both of the trains are on a Sunday

'We support proposals to relocate the station, as part of the wider Tees Valley Metro development, to better serve the needs of rail /air passengers,' the spokesperson added.

'We are already working with partners involved on initial stages of the scheme including the opening of a new station at The James Cook University Hospital and improvements at other stations on the route.'

The station, which was opened in 1971, has two platforms. When the airport changed its name in 2004 to Durham Tees Valley Airport, the station's name remained the same.

The neglect of so many of Britain's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under-served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains.

It is easier for train operating countries to run 'zombie' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly, as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process.
