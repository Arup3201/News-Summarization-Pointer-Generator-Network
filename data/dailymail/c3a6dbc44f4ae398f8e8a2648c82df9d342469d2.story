The billionaire philanthropist Hans Rausing, who lost his wife two years ago after a tragic battle with drug addiction, has found love with the art expert Julia Delves Broughton.

The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Mr Rausing, the Tetra Pak heir, proposed to Miss Delves Broughton, a senior director at Christie’s auction house, while they were in Barbados last month. The couple, who are currently in Venice, have told their family friends they are planning a summer wedding. The announcement marks a milestone in a romance that has taken everyone by surprise.

Few could have anticipated that Hans would ever find peace let alone happiness after years of unimaginable torment following the death of his American wife, Eva.

Hans Rausing and Julia Delves Boughton, the couple met in 2002 but rekindled their relationship after Mr Rausing entered a psychiatric hospital following his former wife's tragic death

He and Eva had spent more than a decade addicted to drugs, and after her decomposing remains were discovered by police at their home in Belgravia, Central London, in the summer of 2012, the grim reality of that addiction was laid bare for all to see.

After Eva’s death, Hans, 50, went to live at Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in Marylebone for two years to recover. It’s where he rekindled his friendship with Julia, who he first met more than a decade ago.

Hans entered the hospital a cadaverous shell of man, broken both physically and emotionally – yet in the six months since his release, friends have witnessed a truly remarkable transformation.

The private benefactor, who has given tens of millions of pounds to charities including The HALO Trust – which removes land mines left behind in wars – museums and veterans’ foundations, has put on weight and the colour has returned to his once hollow cheeks. But perhaps most significantly of all, Hans no longer seems haunted by the spectres of his past. And according to friends that is all thanks to Julia.

Their romance and his recovery have been compared with Victoria Getty rescuing her husband Sir Paul Getty from addiction and helping him to become one of Britain’s greatest philanthropists.

The Rausings together will be strongly defined by their joint efforts to give away much of his fortune.

A friend said: ‘It is very much both of them who are putting philanthropy at the centre of their new life together, both deciding what is given.’

Another friend was told: ‘We’re doing the charity giving together. Our main aim is to support young people, local small charities and mental health charities.’

Their marriage will bring together two extraordinary families – one Sweden’s most inventive industrial dynasty and the other a quirky, blue-blooded English family, legendary for both high living and high drama from Nairobi to Liverpool.

Julia’s elder sister was the brilliant fashionista Isabella Blow, who took her own life seven years ago by drinking weedkiller. Their grandfather was Sir Jock Delves Broughton, a key member of the Kenyan Happy Valley set. He was sensationally acquitted of the murder of Lord Erroll, the lover of his wife, Diana, in the infamous ‘White Mischief’ case which was later made into a film starring Charles Dance and Greta Scacchi. In 1942, shortly after the trial, he took his own life, overdosing at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool.

Julia and Isabella and their younger sister, Lavinia, were brought up at Doddington Hall, a 35,000-acre estate in Cheshire, by their father Sir Evelyn and mother Helen Mary Shore, a barrister.

However, tragedy stalked the family. In 1964, the only boy of the family, John, drowned in the swimming pool when he was only two years old. Then, when the girls were entering their teens, their mother left home, bidding each of her daughters farewell with a formal handshake.

Yet by all accounts, Julia is a level-headed yet spirited achiever with a penchant for high culture and high heels.

One friend said: ‘Julia has a very uncomplicated attitude to life. Like her sister Issie, she is frank, funny and fearless. And like Issie she is untraditional in that she understands conformity but isn’t a conformist. Issie was one of the great celebrators of life and would have been overjoyed at her little sister finding the love of her life at this stage in life.’

Hans’s family are also thrilled. His parents, Hans Senior and Marit, who live in Wadhurst, East Sussex, have met his fiancee a number of times, as has his sister Sigrid, who last night said: ‘We are delighted. Julia and Hans have both been through terrible ordeals, and it’s very moving to see them together, filled with hope and confidence.

‘This is a second chance for Hans – he is very lucky to have found in Julia someone who has an instinctive understanding of emotional pain and the courage to face it with humour and determination.’

The couple first met in 2002 when Hans and Eva went to a lunch at Christie’s auction house in Mayfair, where Julia began working as a secretary 18 years ago. She quickly rose through the ranks, working in Old Masters, then the Valuation Department, before becoming a senior director working for Lord Linley in the Chairman’s Office.

They then met again in 2006 when Hans, a serious art collector, called Christie’s in to make a valuation at his home in Belgravia.

A senior art world figure said: ‘Julia is multi-talented in her sphere with her broad and deep knowledge of the art world and the wide range of people she knows. In that way she’s exemplary. She’s also liked by the people below her as well as the people above her.’

Certainly, she has had a remarkable effect on Hans, a shy, thoughtful man who has always felt the weight of his family’s fortune and who became a recluse for many years as he and Eva descended into addiction.

A family friend said: ‘Hans is finding great succour in reconnecting with life, getting back with friends, reigniting old friendships. You have to remember he and Eva had been ill a very long time. They hadn’t seen anyone for years. The normalcy of life has been incredibly healing. From being a recluse, unable to talk to anyone... it is a fantastic transformation. Through Julia, Hans is finding life again.’

It is believed Julia visited Hans in hospital and played a key part in his rehabilitation. But just as she has helped him, so he has given her the happiness and security that eluded so many in her own family.

‘If anything, their pasts have helped concentrate their minds,’ one friend explained.

‘They know that you have to hold on to hope and  grab life while you can, although without forgetting the past and the people in it.’

The couple have a puppy, and enjoy going to the cinema, visiting friends and art galleries. They went to see Stanley Spencer’s war paintings at Somerset House and often visit Julia’s sister Lavinia in Gloucestershire, where they enjoy going to the local markets. Hans went with Julia to a charity dinner to raise money for the Isabella Blow Foundation last November. In February, he and Julia co-hosted a dinner at the National Gallery to mark the exhibition of German art, Strange Beauty: Masters of the German Renaissance, which was sponsored by Hans.

One friend of the couple said: ‘They are head over heels in love. One only has to look at them to see it. They’re affectionate, they laugh a lot together. Julia’s not the self-pitying type. She has a very uncomplicated attitude to life which is very refreshing. And the change in Hans is remarkable. He looks well, his sense of humour is back. What a recovery. It’s astonishing, there is a sense of new hope about them.’

Although they have yet to make plans for the wedding, Miss Delves Broughton is now sporting an engagement ring, which according to one who has seen it is ‘an enormous diamond with other diamonds on the inside’.

Julia will become involved with her husband’s philanthropy work, which is vast yet discreet. Hans is one of the country’s most generous benefactors, donating to a wide variety of organisations including the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners’ Trust, the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation, which provides housing to disabled and homeless ex-service personnel, and MapAction, which provides mapping services in disaster zones. Hans lives in a flat in Belgravia but often stays at Julia’s modest flat overlooking Battersea Park in South London. One friend said: ‘He’s incredibly normal and domesticated, not at all what you’d expect of someone who is one of the richest men in the world.

‘What’s most noticeable is that they laugh at the same things and they’re unbelievably affectionate with each other. They have a shared interest in art and he’s also quirkily intellectual, loving old black and white movies and the writings of Raymond Carver.’

The couple will eventually move into a Grade II listed property in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, that Hans bought from Roman Abramovich last December. It comprises three conjoined houses including a mansion dating from the 1670s which was once home to the artist James Whistler and the late Tory Minister Paul Channon. The house is in need of a major upgrade, expected to take at least a year.

Hans is gradually parcelling up his past and moving forward but friends insist that is exactly what his wife would have wanted. One said: ‘Eva would be very very happy for Hans. Even in the darkest depths of their despair, Eva always wanted the best for Hans. She used to say, ‘‘If Hans is happy, I’m happy.’’ ’

Now, after years of darkness, it would appear that he is.
