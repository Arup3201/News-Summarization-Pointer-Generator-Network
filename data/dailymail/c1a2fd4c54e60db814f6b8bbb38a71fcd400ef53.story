A parents' group in Russia says Elton John's concert should be banned because it contravenes 'gay propaganda' laws

A Russian parents' committee has asked President Vladimir Putin to cancel a planned concert by gay musician Elton John, saying he intended to violate a ban on 'homosexual propaganda'.

In an open letter to Putin, the local parents' group in central Ural region was reported by media as saying: 'The singer intends to come out in support of local sodomites and break the current Russian law, directed at protecting children.'

Critics say the law banning gay 'propaganda' among minors - which has prompted calls for a boycott of Russia's hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics - is discriminatory, barring people from being open about their sexual orientation.

The law is part of a broader attempt by Putin to win over Russians in the mostly conservative country following protests against his rule among urban and often middle class voters over his return to the Kremlin last May.

The parents' committee was unavailable for comment today, Reuters reported, and a spokesman for the singer said he wished to make no comment.

Sir Elton John, who reminisced in an interview earlier this month about having sex on a Moscow rooftop with a translator during his 1979 Soviet Union tour, said he wanted to perform in Russia to support the gay community.

'As a gay man, I can't leave those people on their own without going over there and supporting them. I don't know what's going to happen, but I've got to go,' he said in the interview.

Elton will perform on December 6 in Moscow and December 7 in Kazan.

One of the world's most prominent gay celebrities, he lives with his partner David Furnish, with whom he is in a civil union, and they are bringing up two children together.

He has campaigned for gay rights in Britain and in Ukraine where he was denied the right in 2009 to adopt a child because of his age and marital status.

Hard line on homosexuals: Russia's president Vladimir Putin is hoping to win over conservative voters

This summer, anti-gay campaigners warned Elton not to wear 'flamboyant' clothes at his planned concert in Krasnodar in July.  The concert was later cancelled when the singer fell ill.

'Promoting homosexuality' is an offence in several Russian regions, including Krasnodar, St Petersburg, and Novosibirsk.

Last year Madonna was sued by Russian anti-gay groups for £7m for violating the local laws after they claimed her concert in St Petersburg, in which she spoke in favour of gay rights, 'promoted homosexuality'.  The lawsuit was later thrown out of court.

Elton John and David Furnish are raising two sons - adoptions by same-sex foreigners is banned in Russia

Lady Gaga criticised the law in concerts in St Petersburg last year, leading Moscow to implement a harsher visa regimes for performers coming to Russia.

U.S. singer Cher turned down an invitation to perform at the Winter Games in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi because of the anti-gay propaganda, saying the decision was a 'no brainer'.

Russia's anti-gay stance has hardened considerably in recent years.  Earlier this year Putin announced a ban on adoptions by foreign same-sex couples, claiming that the children could be 'psychologically damaged'.

The decision followed the commissioning of a report into so called 'psychological damage' suffered by a boy was who was adopted by two gay women in the US.
