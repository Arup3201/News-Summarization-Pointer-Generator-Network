Gone too soon: Dammion Heard, 20, a student at 
Western State Colorado University, was found dead not far from from 
campus five days after his disappearance

The parents of a 20-year-old champion wrestler who was found dead in Colorado two weeks ago say they are certain their son was the victim of foul play and not a suicide.  

The body of 20-year-old Dammion Heard was discovered April 2 on Bureau of Land Management property 8 miles east of Gunnison, Colorado. His 2004 Saturn Vue was found nearby.

Heard was last seen alive the previous Saturday in the vicinity of Western State Colorado University, where he was a freshman studying petroleum geology.

The Gunnison Police Department said at the time that no suspects are being pursued, and that the circumstances surrounding Heard's death do not pose a threat to the Western State campus, suggesting that the student killed himself.

Police later said the cause of death was strangulation by hanging.

The freshman’s family, however, have questioned the preliminary results of the investigation, stating that their son was in no way suicidal.

'[He was] always upbeat, never had any issues with depression,' Gary Heard, Dammion's father, told the station WFAA.

According to the victim’s parents, the 20-year-old student athlete was involved in a fight, which broke out at an off-campus house party the night he disappeared.

Rest in peace: Dammion Heard was laid to rest last weekend, nearly two weeks after his death

The next day, Heard was planning to meet up with a girl, and just minutes before he supposedly drove into an open field and hung himself, Heard was caught on a surveillance camera filling up his car.

‘None of it adds up,’ Mr Heard said. ‘It all just seemed really fishy.’

Police say the investigation into Heard’s death is still ongoing. They are waiting for a toxicology report in the case before making a final determination, which could take up to a month.

Dammion’s father told the Star-Telegram that he drove to the site where his son’s body was found and conducted an experiment, which convinced him that the official version of events does not make sense.

‘I took a mannequin out there and hung it up from the only tree that was there,’ he said. ‘He couldn’t have been up there very long because you can easily see the tree from the road.’

Mr Heard also pointed out other clues that set off alarm bells for him, including the fact that the battery was removed from his son’s cell phone, and that Dammion had locked his car and placed the keys in his pocket before allegedly hanging himself.

‘I just don't get it,’ his father said.

The young man’s parents believe that the mystery surrounding their son’s death is linked to a house party he attended on the night of March 29, where he allegedly got into a scrap with someone. 

Eyewitnesses have revealed to Gary Heard that Dammion was seen being pulled into a bedroom by two men. He was later photographed with bruised hands.

Clues: The student's family say Dammion was involved in a fight the night before he went missing, and the following morning he was supposed to meet up with a girl

On the morning of March 30, Dammion texted a girl asking her to meet with him at his dorm room, his father said. The friend replied that she was on her way, but did not hear back from him.

At 1.30am, Dammion pulled up to a gas station in Gunnison, where a surveillance camera captured him filling up his Saturn with $25 worth of gas.

‘He wasn’t drunk or staggering,’ Gary Heard said after seeing the footage.

The father has since obtained Dammion’s phone records showing that someone used his cell phone to send a text message while the student was pumping gas – even though there was no phone in his hands in the surveillance footage. 

The Heards are convinced their son was the victim of foul play. The father is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Dammion’s killer.

‘There is no way my son took his own life,’ Gary Heard declared.

Their friends also have set up a memorial fund to cover legal fees and help finance the Heards' private investigation into Dammion’s death.  

During his senior year at Fossil Ridge High School in Texas, Heard won the 2013 state wrestling title in the 113-pound weight class, The Star-Telegram reported.

His high school wrestling coach Tony Lopez told the paper that Heard had been a wrestler since childhood, and that his father, Gary Heard, helped train him. 

Western State Colorado interim president Brad Baca released a statement two weeks ago reacting to Heard's passing.

'Dammion was a vibrant and beloved member of the campus community, a great student and an accomplished athlete,' the statement read. 'Our hearts and thoughts are with his family and friends.'

Those who knew the 20-year-old student athlete from Azle, Texas, were left wondering about what may have led to the tragedy.

On his Facebook page, the handsome, 5-foot-7, 125-pound student appeared well-liked and popular, with dozens of photos depicting him laughing and hanging out with friends.

Coach Lopez said Heard had always struck him as smart and 'calm-headed.'

‘He understood wrestling,’ Lopez said. ‘He had his goals set and he knew what he had to do.’

Meanwhile, Heard's current and former classmates and wrestling partners took to Twitter to express their grief at his untimely passing.

'RIP to Dammion Heard,' tweeted Oliver Pierce. ‘Have had some awesome memories with you and your dad since the youth days! I feel sick to my stomach!’

Another friend Lorenzo Padron wrote: 'R.I.P to one of the best wrestlers I knew Dammion Heard 2x state finalist 2013 state Champ at 113.'

Heard celebrated his 20th birthday in November 2013, writing on his Facebook wall: 'I turn 20 on Sunday nothing comes good at 20 lol!'
