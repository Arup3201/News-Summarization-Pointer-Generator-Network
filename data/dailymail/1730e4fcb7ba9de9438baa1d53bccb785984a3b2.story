A public-spirited father was fined for his kindness as he reunited a lost terrier with its owner - because he unknowingly waited on playing fields from which dogs were banned.

Marc Harrison spotted the missing pet, called Bobby, wandering the streets of Heysham, Lancashire and found a number for the owner on its  collar.

But after arranging to meet the owner in a nearby playing field, Mr Harrison was approached by dog wardens who quickly handed him an £85 penalty fine.

Marc Harrison was left furious after he was handed a fine by 'horrible' dog wardens as he waited to return a lost terrier to its rightful owner 

Mr Harrison said: 'I feel penalised for doing the right thing. I was worried it might get knocked over. I called the phone number on the collar but couldn't get an answer at first.

'I was only there two or three minutes and I'd just got through to the owner when the dog wardens came on and said "you can't walk your dog there".

'They were quite horrible about it. I was never given the opportunity to explain myself. Now I've got to pay £85 and I feel like I did the dog wardens' jobs for them.'

Mr Harrison had been walking with partner Zara, nine-month-old son Rupert, and his own dog Edard when he saw the lost animal running free.

His partner took Rupert and Edard to their car, while Mr Harrison called the number on the dog's collar.

He said he did not realise dogs were banned from the  site because he was not local to the area and so waited there for the owner to turn up and retrieve their pet.

He said: 'I don't live down there so I didn't know it was restricted walking. I didn't want to put the dog in the car with Rupert so I walked over to a nearby field.

'I said "this is ridiculous". I had the baby in my arms so I left the dog with them and walked off.'

Owner Robert Claxton has backed Mr Harrison's explanation and called on Lancaster City Council to overturn the fine.

The terrier,  Bobby, had run away from its disabled owner's house when a visitor arrived at the front door

Mr Claxton, who is disabled, said his dog Bobby had run out of the house into the road as his carer came through the door.

He said: 'I'd like to thank Mr Harrison and why they have charged him I don't know.

'I didn't know that he had been fined. The dog wardens know me, they told me everything was all right.

'He was only in that field because it was the easiest place for me to pick Bobby up. I'd go to court and vouch for him if need be.'

Lancaster City Council said: 'The council is unable to comment on the specifics of individual cases.

'King George's Field is leased by a youth football club, who have previously experienced a persistent problem with dog fouling that was severely affecting their use of the field.

'The field has been recently fenced off, which has resulted in it becoming a dog exclusion area.'

Mr Harrison said he was unaware of the rules as he is not from the area and was concerned with looking after his son, Rupert, and the dog he was helping to retrieve at the time
