So it turns out at least one Barclays Premier League team is capable of making smooth, stylish progress in Europe.

While many of their rivals have struggled this season, falling down when not expected or shooting themselves in the foot, Everton have gone from strength-to-strength. Thanks to another impressive night at Goodison Park, a point separates them from the Europa League’s knockout stages.

Roberto Martinez, of course, will take nothing for granted. But after swatting Lille aside 3-0, thanks to goals from Leon Osman, Phil Jagielka and Steven Naismith, the only question up for debate is whether Everton finish top of Group H or as runners-up.

 Yet for one of the scorers, another poser needed to be considered.

‘We are thoroughly enjoying the European experience,’ said Jagielka. ‘We are determined to stay in the competition for as long as possible. Can we win it? Why not? Did anyone think Fulham would get to the final a few years ago? No. There’s a long way to go but we are in this competition to win it.’

The issue of who finishes top will be decided in Wolfsburg on November 27 but if Everton play with the panache that helped them dismantle the first French visitors to Goodison Park, it will be theirs with a game to spare. How a few of Martinez’s managerial peers would like to be in such a position.

Initially Everton took time to find their stride. Though Romelu Lukaku had a chance after 24 seconds, when his drive beaten away by Victor Enyeama, they couldn’t build up a head of steam and, for a period, there were some anxieties.

Yet with Gareth Barry, James McCarthy – the game’s outstanding performer – and Naismith all involved, Everton kept the ball moving and, eventually, their persistence paid off. The breakthrough arrived just before the half-hour.

It was a fine goal, too. Lukaku found McCarthy who swiftly sent Aiden McGeady marauding down the right; McCarthy carried his run into the area but his compatriot picked out Osman, who applied a thumping right foot finish.

Osman is not a player who courts the spotlight but he has had a career of which he can be proud. He has devoted his life to Everton, squeezed every last ounce of ability from himself and always been there to do a job. It is why he has been awarded a new 12-month contract.

From the moment that drive nestled in the back of Enyeama’s net – it was Osman’s first goal since March – there was never any doubt Everton would go on to run out authoritative winners and they put clear light between themselves just before half-time thanks to Jagielka.

This was a more direct effort – McGeady’s outswinging corner finding the captain at the back post, who stooped to guide his header beyond Lille captain Rio Mavuba on the back post – but there were no complaints on the touchline from Martinez, who celebrated with an arm aloft.

Lille briefly threatened to make a fight of things and in the first attack of the second period, Divock Origi – who will join Liverpool next summer – tried to show why Brendan Rodgers believes he is a “world class talent”, with a skipping, jinking run into the area.

That was to be as good as it got for Lille. Everton quickly went back through the gears and Lukaku was denied the third goal of the evening when Enyeama plunged to his left to prevent the Belgian’s dipping free-kick nestling in the Gwladys Street net.

Any frustration felt then was short lived. On the hour, Everton launched another rapid break down the left, with Baines swapping passes with Lukaku before sweeping in a cross that Naismith gleefully smashed into the top corner, past the helpless Enyeama.

Had they gone through the gears, there could have been more but that was a minor complaint. Everton’s grand ambitions have momentum.

‘We are a football club that is expected to win things,’ said Martinez. ‘Europe is in our DNA. I thought we played really well. What pleased me most is every player is ready to embrace the opportunity of playing in Europe.’
