Remember Tiger Woods' incredible chip-in at the Masters in 2005 and the will-it-or-won't-it pause before his ball dropped into the cup? Time seemed to stand still as Tiger's Nike ball made its final revolution, and one of golf's legendary moments was born.

But if you thought that was a dramatic pause, it has nothing on Scott Langley's putt at Muirfield Village last week.

While Woods's ball hovered on the lip for a second or so, the 25-year-old American had to wait a full 24 seconds for his ball to drop.

Birdie chance: Scott Langley putts on the 16th green at Muirfield during the Memorial Tournament 

Unfortunate: Langley looked like he had just missed his chance with the ball coming to a rest behind the hole

Hang on a second (or 24): But the ball was still in motion and moving very slowly towards the hole

How about that? Langley shrugs after his ball finally relent to gravity and drops in the hole 

OK, so Woods was chasing the Masters title at Augusta on a Sunday while Langley was on his way to finishing 28th in the Memorial Tournament, so the 14-time major champion's chip was just a little more important in the grand scheme of things.

But Langley's putt was quite remarkable. His 12-foot birdie effort curled around the back of the cup on the 16th green at Muirfield Village before seemingly coming to a stop just millimetres from its intended target.

But the ball wasn't quite done yet. Although it is hard to see on the TV footage, his ball was fractionally moving towards the cup all the time.

The most dramatic of pauses: Tiger Woods holed an incredible chip-in at the Masters in 2005

The rules of golf state that a moving ball must not be hit and so Langley, after a conversation with playing partner Bubba Watson, waited and urged his ball to complete its final roll.

Finally, it relented to gravity and fell in for a birdie two. With no need for jumping up and down or blowing on it either.

Eat your heart out, Tiger.
