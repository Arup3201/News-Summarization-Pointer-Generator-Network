Congress' most serious gun-control effort in years passed the first step towards legalization on Thursday as the Senate pushed past conservatives' attempted blockade under the teary gaze of families of victims of December's Connecticut school shootings.

The bipartisan 68-31 vote rebuffed an effort to keep debate from even starting, giving an early victory - and perhaps political momentum - to President Barack Obama and his gun control allies.

Four months after 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown were killed, relatives watching the vote from a gallery overlooking the Senate floor dabbed at tears and clasped hands, some seeming to pray.

In their honor: Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, and Jillian Soto, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto, spoke alongside senators after the new bill passed Congress

Emotional: Jillian Soto was surrounded by other parents and family members who lost relatives in the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many of whom have been pushing for stricter gun laws ever since

Emotional: Many of the Newtown relatives, including Jillian Soto, were present as they have pushed legislators to take action, specifically requiring background checks for all gun sales which was approved today

Even so, few supporters of the legislation are confident of victory. Several weeks of emotional, unpredictable Senate debate lie ahead, and a mix of gun-rights amendments, opposition from the National Rifle Association and skepticism from House Republican leaders leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress.

Today the bill passed through the Senate with bi-partisan support. It still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives in Congress before becoming law, but if it is passed it will:

Foes of the proposed new restrictions say they would penalize law-abiding citizens and do nothing to curb gun violence.

'The hard work starts now,' said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democrat who brought the legislation to the floor for debate.

Still, in a Congress marked by a notable lack of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, Thursday's vote was one of several displays of unusual rapport across party lines.

Hoping to bring pressure on Congress to act on gun control, supporters of new restrictions have been demonstrating in Washington.

They have erected a mock graveyard with thousands of crosses on the National Mall, symbolizing victims of gun violence.Â 

Starting in: Volunteer Martin Witchger begins putting some of the crosses in the lawn of the National Mall early Thursday morning hours before the background check bill passed its first hurdle in Congress

Big numbers: All told, there were 3,300 markers on the Mall as that is the number of people affected by gun violence in the U.S. since December 14, the date of the Newtown shooting

Making an impact: Gun control advocates set up a display of crosses and Stars of David on the National Mall as a mock cemetery to show how many people lose their lives to guns

The Senate's firearms bill would subject
nearly all gun buyers to background checks, add muscle to federal laws by 
barring illicit firearm sales and provide slightly more money for school
safety measures.

Excluded and facing near-certain defeat in upcoming votes were proposals to ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines - factors in the Newtown killings some other recent mass shootings. But keeping those provisions out of the current legislation did not mollify critics.

Opponents said the remaining proposals were unwarranted intrusions on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, would be ignored by criminals and would do little to prevent future Newtowns.

Obama's plans have received scant support from Republicans and many moderate Democrats, with many saying they prefer improvements in dealing with the mentally ill and stronger enforcement of existing laws.

Hoping for momentum: Lori Haas, a mother who lost a relative to gun violence, is one of the many people who have been pushing for attention to be paid to the Sandy Hook relatives proposals

'I'm not interested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the Sandy Hook shootings no real solutions that they seek,' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-leading Republican.

Congress hasn't approved major gun restrictions since enacting an assault weapons ban 19 years ago, a prohibition that lawmakers let lapse after a decade.

Some potential amendments could broaden gun rights and weaken supporters' backing for the overall bill.

One proposal is by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Mark Begich who say it would improve how the federal background check system blocks weapons from going to people with certain mental problems, though critics say it would make it harder in some cases to do so. Another possible amendment would require states to recognize permits for carrying concealed weapons issued by other states.

In Thursday's vote, 50 Democrats and 2 Democratic-leaning independents were joined by 16 Republicans in voting to begin debate on the legislation.

Support: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer from New York has been one of the strongest advocates for pushing through the more strict gun control laws

Proximity: New York's Schumer was joined alongside Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal when he addressed the press and the Newtown relatives

Twenty-nine Republicans and two Democrats facing re-election next year in GOP-leaning states voted 'no' - Alaska's Begich and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.

After the roll call, Obama spoke by phone with some Newtown families and said he would 'keep fighting for the votes they deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney.

The Senate plans to debate an amendment Tuesday expanding background checks less broadly than the overall legislation would. Broadening the system to cover more transactions is the heart of the current effort on guns.

That amendment, a compromise between Republican Senator Patrick Toomey and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin would subject buyers in commercial settings like gun shows and the Internet to the checks but exempt non-commercial transactions like sales between friends and relatives.

Reaching out: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia met with Newtown in his office. He was one of the leaders on the background check bill that was approved in Congress today

That accord, unveiled Wednesday, was designed to build bipartisan support for the legislation and seemed likely to do so. Toomey and Manchin are among the most conservative members of their parties and are both gun owners with NRA ratings of A, which is the highest that the gun lobbyist awards.

Toomey said Thursday he believes supporters of his compromise with Manchin would be able to beat back any filibuster attempt.

'Beyond that, I just don't know yet,' he said on 'CBS This Morning.'

Gun-control
groups have embraced the Manchin-Toomey compromise with varying degrees
of enthusiasm, and they continued to applaud it on Thursday - while 
also expressing concerns about some provisions.

Possible roadblock: Skepticism from House Republican leaders like House Speaker John Boehner leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress

Besides the exemption for private sales, gun control advocates expressed displeasure with language letting gun dealers sell handguns to out-of-state customers, exempting some holders of permits for concealed weapons from background checks and shielding individuals who sell guns from some negligence lawsuits.

'We are optimistic that this bill will make a dramatic difference in reducing gun violence,' said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

The NRA said it opposed the Manchin-Toomey compromise and warned senators that it would count votes on provisions it opposes in its evaluation of candidates that it provides its members, who the organization says number nearly 5 million.
