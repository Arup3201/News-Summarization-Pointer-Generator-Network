A man who 'smiled' as he shot his ex-wife's husband six times in 'cold blood' has been found guilty of his murder.

Cristobal Palacio, 46, was found guilty of the second degree murder of Paul Winter, 42, originally from Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in October 2008.

Mr Winter was shot dead in front of his wife Jennifer and her and Palacio's six-year-old twins at the murderer's home in Kendall, Miami, Florida.

At Miami's Gerstein Justice Building, Palacio denied murder, claiming he had to shoot in self-defence after he was 'harassed' by the Briton.

The murderer, who was originally charged with first degree murder, told the jury that on two occasions Mr Winter had put a gun to his head, 'hunted' him and threatened him, the Miami Herald reported

His defence lawyer, Michael Walsh, said Palacio 'exercised his most basic human right' because he acted in fear of is own life, according to the newspaper.

The bank security executive, who had gone through a bitter divorce with his former wife, shot Mr Winter six times, including twice in the back, while he 'smiled', his daughter told jurors, the Miami Herald reported.

The brute, who killed Mr Winter on Jennifer's 37th birthday, said he had armed himself for daily routines, like collecting his post or walking the dog, said he shot his former wife's husband because he thought he was warmed.

But the victim was unarmed and had driven to Palacio's home to drop off his step-children for a court-arranged access visit.

The killing followed an acrimonious divorce after the couple had been married for 12 years, and a bitter custody battle over Palacio's twin children.

Mr Winter had met his new wife online, married her in 2007 threee days after her divorce was settled and moved to Miami.

The Miami Herald reported that the version of events surrounding the killing differed.

Mrs Winter said Palacio stormed out of his house in a rage, screaming profanities, and then shot her husband.

But Palacio said he was not expecting a visit from the couple and was at home with his girlfriend.

The
Miami Herald reported that Gabriel Hernandez, a ballistics expert, said
that after examining Winter's wounds, the .40 caliber SIG Sauer Palacio
that was used must have been fired from just three feet away.

Mark
Shuman, of the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's office, also told jurors 
that Paul Winter's back injuries were contact wounds, meaning he had to 
be against a hard surface when he was shot.

Jennifer Winter testified that Palacio shot her husband twice in the back while he was lying on the ground.

'That's not who I am. I don't like confrontation. I don't like fights,' Palacio said on the stand Wednesday.

But the court was told that Mr Winter had
been unarmed at the time and had driven with his new wife to Palacio's 
home to deliver the children for a court-arranged access visit.

Palacio said he owned a gun because it reminded him of his grandfather, who hunted for sport.

Jurors
decided to convict Palacio of the lesser murder charge which carries a 
mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 20 years behind bars.

He was also convicted of two counts of child abuse, as a result of his children having witnessed the shooting.

Palacio,
who worked as a fraud investigator for Citibank for more than 25 years,
had claimed that Mr Winter had threatened him with a gun on two 
previous occasions.

But Mr Winter's wife said he had not owned a gun.

Mr
Winter, who has a child in the UK from a previous relationship, was in 
the process of applying for US residency and the family had planned to 
set up a bed and breakfast business, jurors heard.
