The Black Student Union at UC Berkeley wants to honour convicted murderer Assata Shakur (above) by renaming a university building after her

A student group has demanded that a university building is renamed after a convicted murderer. 

The Black Student Union at UC Berkeley wants to honour Assata Shakur, the first woman on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists, with the name change.

Shakur was found guilty of shooting New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1977. 

The 67-year-old former Black Panther activist escaped from prison two years later and is thought to be hiding in Cuba.

The union believes she represents an 'icon of resistance within oppressed communities', Fox News reported.

Cori McGowens, a junior at the university, said: 'We want the renaming of it to [go to] someone, Assata Shakur, who we feel represents us as black students.'

The students have also asked the university to hire two black admissions officers, two black psychologists and two black advisers. 

They are  hoping an African-American resource center will be created.

Their request for a building, thought to be Barrows Hall, to be renamed has split reactions on social media.

One user @Ilianerrz wrote on Twitter: 'WHY DO STUDENTS AT UC BERKLEY (sic) WANT TO NAME A BUILDING AFTER ASSATA SHAKUR?!??'

And Janine Simone said: 'What is this world coming to? #police #PoliceLivesMatter.' 

But some people supported the idea.

One user with the handle @ismokethentweet wrote: 'Shout out to the black student organization at UC Berkeley who's demanding one of their buildings to be named after Assata Shakur.' 

Nicholas Dirks, UC Berkeley's chancellor, said he has not yet made a decision.

He said more staff had been hired recently and two programmes to help black students earn advanced degrees had been granted funding.

He added: 'Too many students have told us about being excluded from study groups, ignored during class discussions, verbally harassed at parties and social events, and feeling in a general sense, vulnerable, isolated, and invisible.

 

The Black Student Union's request for a building to be renamed has split reactions on social media with some questioning the idea and others taking to Twitter to show their support

'This is something we deplore.' 

UC Berkeley had 36,204 students enrolled last year. Around three per cent were black, according to university data.

The FBI is offering a $2million reward for any information that leads to Shakur's capture.
