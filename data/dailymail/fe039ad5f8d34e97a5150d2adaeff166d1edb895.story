Tracy Morgan still hasn't recovered from the injuries he sustained in a June car crash with a truck, but the comedian is working hard to get better.

The 45-year-old comedian's attorney appeared on the Today show on Monday to give an update on Morgan's condition and speak about their current lawsuit against WalMart, whose truck driver caused the deadly crash.

'He's still struggling but he's a fighter,' attorney Benedict Morelli said.

Doing better: Tracy Morgan's attorney Benedict Morelli appeared on the Today show Monday morning to give an update on the 45-year-old comedian's condition after a serious car crash in June

The former 30 Rock star and a group of friends were returning from a stand-up show in Dover, Delaware early June 7 when trucker Kevin Roper, 35, smashed into their limousine-van while speeding 20 mph over the limit on the New Jersey Turnpike.

Close-friend and comedian James McNair - known as Jimmy Mack - was killed in the crash while Morgan suffered a broken leg and ribs.

His assistant Jeffrey Millea and comedian Ardley Fugua were also injured in the crash, and Fuqua remains hospitalized two months later.

Lawsuit: Morgan and the other passengers in the vehicle are now suing WalMart for their negligence in letting the truck driver work 13 hours straight. Above, a view of the beat-up limousine-van that was carrying Morgan and his friends

Morgan is still in rehab from the crash, and was pictured out last month moving around with the help of a walker going to a doctor's appointment in Midtown Manhattan with his fiancee Megan Wollover and their 1-year-old named Maven.

He has since filed a lawsuit against WalMart for their negligence in letting truck-driver Roper operate one of their vehicles even though he had been up for nearly 25 hours at the time of the crash - a violation of New Jersey law.

A report by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving 65 mph in a 45 mph construction zone when he rammed into the vehicle carrying Morgan and friends.

He had also been on the job for more than 13 hours at the time, even though truck drivers are only allowed to work up to 14 hours a day, with a maximum of 11 spent behind the wheel.

Roper's final destination that night was Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which Morelli says would have involved going over the legal limit.

WalMart has issued a new statement to NBC, calling the crash a 'terrible tragedy'.

'We are cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation and working to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident,' the statement reads.

But Morelli says he hasn't seen any 'full responsibility' yet, representing Morgan as well as Fuqua and Millea.

If the 
case goes to trial, Morelli says he will prove that it is the company 
culture at WalMart that employees are pushed to work illegal hours.

In
 Roper case, Morelli says he had to commute more than 700 miles from his
 home in Jonesboro, Georgia just to pick up his truck in Delaware and 
continue working.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, also claims Roper fell asleep at the wheel.

Morgan, Fuqua and Millea are asking for a trial by jury and compensatory damages.

James McNair's adult children are considering suing the company and truck driver as well.

Haven't stepped up: Morgan's attorney says WalMart has yet to take 'full responsibility' for the June 7 crash

Morgan is best known for playing the role of 'Tracy Jordan' on NBC show 30 Rock, and his time on Saturday Night Live

Roper is also facing criminal charges for the crash and has pleaded not guilty to charges of death by auto and assault by auto.

Fellow-comedian Neal Brennan also gave an update on Morgan's condition when he appeared on 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' last week.

'From what I can tell, he is great,' Brennan said of Morgan. 'Physically, I don't know. He said he is going to rehab every day.'

'Mentally, he seems all there. Because we were talking, and he was like, "Neal. I mean, the outpouring of love was unbelievable. I mean, the people that reached out to me: Busta Rhymes, LL Cool J, the president,"' Brennan said. 'The fact that Tracy put LL Cool J and Busta Rhymes above the president let's me know that Tracy is back.'
