Tragedy: The University of Oklahoma removed fire escapes from the building where student Casey Cooke, 22, slipped and fell to her death last week as she attempted to climb to the roof

Fire escapes from the east and west sides of Evans Hall were taken away after a review with the local fire department showed that people could escape during an emergency through an internal staircase, according to The Norman Transcript.

Sprinkler systems and fire alarms had been installed inside the building in 1999 as part of a fire suppression system that would ensure safety without the fire escapes, NewsOK.com reported.

The university is considering whether to remove the remaining external fire escapes on campus at Carnegie and Monnet halls, according to The Norman Transcript.

The news agency that the chief medical examiner ruled the June 3 death as accidental and not a suicide after Cooke climbed the fire escape to get to the roof and fell to the ground.

The 22-year-old was found lying outside, east of Evans Hall, which is the central administrative building on campus, by university staff who patrol the area.

OU spokeswoman Catherine Bishop says emergency crews responded and administered CPR but that Cooke could not be resuscitated.
