A taxi driver had a lucky escape today when he misjudged a bend and drove straight through a wall, leaving his car balanced precariously above another road.  

The Volkswagen Passat was tottering over the 10ft drop for hours after the crash in Birmingham around 2am this morning.  

The taxi was apparently driving down a hill on Gas Street, near the city centre, when the driver failed to anticipate the sharp turn and carried on through the wall.

Trouble: The driver apparently failed to anticipate a bend in the road and carried on straight ahead

The streets were shut for three hours while the area was made safe, and the pavement below the crash scene was covered in piles of bricks.  

The driver was taken to hospital to be treated, but was discharged around 10am.  

Pedestrian Sarah Morris, who passed by the scene shortly after the crash, posted on twitter: 'Excuse my language... But s***!  

'That would be a car smashed through the wall at the bottom of Gas Street. Clearly didn't slow down for the corner.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police were called at around 2.10am this morning to reports of a car which had crashed into a wall on Gas Street and Holliday Street in Birmingham city centre.  

'Officers attended and found that a private hire taxi - a blue Volkswagen Passat - had struck a bridge.

'Holliday Street was closed while the road was cleared at around 5am.  

'The driver was taken to hospital as a precaution. The cause of the collision continues to be investigated.'  

Chaos: Eyewitnesses were staggered to see the car hanging over the edge of the road 

In happier times: The wall pictured intact before the incident which happened overnight 

A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'We received a call just before 2.10am to reports of a car of a car in collision with a wall.

'We sent one ambulance and an ambulance driver, by the time they arrived the driver was already out of his car.  

'He was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital and we have no information on his condition.'
