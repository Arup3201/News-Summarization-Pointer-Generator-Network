Chilling images have emerged showing terrorists loyal to the Islamic State on a hill-walking holiday in the Iraqi mountains as they take a break from the rape and massacre of the local population. 

The photographs, released by ISIS' official propaganda wing, show the militants reading the Koran, enjoying a picnic, and even riding ponies as they relax  in northern Iraq's mountainous region.

With total disregard for the atrocities carried out by ISIS in the country over the past year, including the kidnapping and forced sex slavery of thousands of young Yazidi girls, the heavily armed men are seen smiling as they happily pose with the terror group's sinister black and white banner.

Taking it easy: The six holidaying jihadis are also seen sitting cross-legged in a semi-circle as they pose for photographs showing them reading the Koran while they relax in the Iraqi mountains

Highest: The assault rifle-wielding men are seen climbing a steep cliff, raising their index fingers in the air in a display of religious devotion once they reach the summit

Defenceless: This photograph shows one of the militants grinning as he struggles to climb on to the back of a white horse. The animal looks so ill-treated and malnourished that its ribs are clearly visible

Photographs of the militants relaxing in northern Iraq were widely shared on social media by thousands of sympathisers of the Islamic State terror group.

Several images show the assault rifle-wielding men climbing a steep cliff and raising their index fingers in the air in a display of religious devotion once they reach the summit.

Another photograph shows one of the militants grinning as he struggles to climb on to the back of a white horse. The animal looks so poorly-treated and malnourished that its ribs are clearly visible.

The six holidaying jihadis are also seen sitting cross-legged in a semi-circle as they pose for photographs showing them either reading the Koran or holding state-of-the-art assault rifles as the chilling black and white flag of ISIS flutters in the wind behind them.

While not out on the mountains, the men appear to spend their time preparing and consuming food. 

One photograph shows them frying what appear to be homemade chips, while a second captures them sitting inside a building eating and reading religious texts.

The images emerged as the United Nations human rights office said that ISIS fighters may have committed genocide against the minority Yezidi community in Iraq as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes against civilians including children.

In a report based on interviews with more than 100 alleged victims and witnesses, it urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court for prosecution of perpetrators.

The report also said Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias 'may have committed some war crimes' while battling the insurgency.

The U.N. Human Rights Council launched its inquiry in September after the Islamist militant group Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized large swathes of northern Iraq.

The report said the Council had found 'information that points to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes', and that the Security Council should 'consider referring the situation in Iraq to the International Criminal Court'.

There was a 'manifest pattern of attacks' by Islamic State on Yezidis as well as Christians and other minorities as it laid siege to towns and villages in Iraq.

The U.N. investigators also cited allegations that ISIL had used chlorine gas, a prohibited chemical weapon, against Iraqi soldiers in the western province of Anbar in September.

Captured women and children were treated as 'spoils of war', and often subjected to rape or sexual slavery, it said.

The report said that ISIL's Islamic sharia courts in Mosul had also meted out cruel punishments including stoning and amputation. 'Thirteen teenage boys were sentenced to death for watching a football match,' it said.

The U.N. investigators said it was 'widely alleged' that Iraqi government forces had used barrel bombs, an indiscriminate weapon banned by international law, but this required further investigation.
