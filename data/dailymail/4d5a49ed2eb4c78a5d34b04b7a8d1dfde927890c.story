Fresh-faced and delicate, Esme, from Oldham in Manchester, might be barely 15 years old but to many in the Roma gypsy community, she's a catch.

Originally from Hungary, she is just one of the estimated 250,000 Romany gypsies to relocate to the UK from Eastern Europe over the last decade.

But with the influx of people has come their traditions - including the custom of marrying off girls and boys once they reach the age of 13.

In demand: Esme is just 15 but has already been asked for as a bride. Luckily, her grandmother says no

Luckily for Esme, that won't be her fate. 'Today girls and boys are equal,' insists her grandmother. 'If she marries at 15 and has many children, she won’t have a life.

'I’m
 in love with Romany Gypsy culture, We have beautiful traditions. But 
the early marriage custom is no good. It needs to be changed.'

Not every gypsy thinks this way however, and Esme's older sister was herself married off aged 14 to a man in Hungary two years ago.

While the legal age for marriage in Hungary is 16, the authorities often turn a blind eye. Under the traditional Pachiv Gypsy code, families must pay a bride price for the girls - often of up to £5,000.

But with many unable to afford so much, girls can change hands for as little as £3,000. Either way, in the UK, youthful marriage often brings unwanted attention from the police.

One man to fall prey to the authorities' crackdown on gypsy marriage in the UK is Huko, an unemployed father of two who lives in Rotherham in Yorkshire.

Too young: Under the Pachiv code, girls and boys are married off when they hit puberty - sometimes at 13

Not happening: Esme's mother (left) and grandmother (right) want her to go to school rather than marry

Huko, who moved to the UK a year ago, is yet to find a steady job, or indeed, claim benefits as so far, the local council has turned down his application.

'There's no job, nothing,' he complains. 'What can we do? If I 
steal, there’s food, if not there’s nothing. If we go stealing, the police
 arrest us.' Incongruously, he adds: 'The wise never work.'

With Huko and his family live his nephew, 23, his wife Maria, 14, and his 27-year-old niece Kivek, who was married off herself at 13 and, in consequence, has never been to school.

'I
 don’t know how to read and to write,' she reveals. 'I’m 27 and without school, 
without work, without anything.

'I got married when I was 13. Since
 I was 13, I've had to look after myself. Begging around people for £1, £2... for one euro to buy food and stuff to live.'

Not, however, that has put her off marrying young as is traditional under the traditional Gypsy Code, which is known as Pachiv. 'When
 you're 11 or 12, when you're married you get responsibilities,' she continues.

'You have to make a responsibility, you're working. You have to make your
 own life, make your own house, make your own child. You have to grow 
them up. That's when you get married.'

The police, however, take a dim view of this approach and have paid frequent visits to Huko's home in search of 14-year-old Maria.

Different ideas: Romanian Roma gypsy Huko lives with his nephew, 23, and his 14-year-old pregnant wife

Not good: Despite lying to the police, the girl is eventually taken into care - as are his own two daughters

Maria, who is in an illegal gypsy marriage with Huko's nephew, came to the attention of social workers after being seen by a GP.

Were social workers to discover the truth about Maria's marital status, that could cause problems for Kivek and Huko and as a result, they lie to the police whenever they visit.

'We
 lied because we didn't want to tell the truth,' says Kivek. 'It's because 
she's fourteen, she's pregnant.

'She has a husband here. She left her mum
 in Spain. She lives here but we said to them she doesn’t live here. 
It's because If they find her they'll take her.'

Take her, they eventually do - much to the horror of Huko and Maria's mother Nadia. 'He
 had my daughter taken into care,' she fumes, blaming Huko for what happened.

'I will cut his nose off, I will take 
his eyes out. I regret with all my 
heart that I had to come here.'

Nevertheless, she too is happy to see her daughter married to a much older man. 'I got married at 13 and had a baby at 15,' she explains. 'These are our rules.'
