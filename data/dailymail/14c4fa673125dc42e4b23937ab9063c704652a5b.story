A girl whose organs were slowly being crushed under their own weight because of a spinal defect has been saved - after doctors amputated her legs and inserted the bones into her back.

Rosie Davies, five, was born with a massive gap in her spine, and her legs were folded up under the back of her thighs.

The missing segment meant Rosie's body did not have enough support and she may have died from organ failure.

Rosie's mother said the young girl had never considered herself to be disabled, and would always find away around obstacles

But doctors at
Birmingham Children’s Hospital saved her life after coming up with a radical solution - 
amputate her lower legs, which had very little feeling in them, and use the bone to forge the gap in her
spine.

Rosie, from Walsall in the 
West Midlands, became the first child in the UK and only the second 
person in the world to undergo the pioneering surgery last month and is 
now recovering well.

Her mother, Mandy Collett, could not be more proud of her.

She said: 'Rosie has never considered herself as 
disabled. She decides what she wants to do, and finds a way to do it, 
overcoming any obstacle.

'She has always been very active enjoying dance,
sport and playing with others.  She is an exceptionally bright young 
girl who is above average academically.'

Rosie is the only person in the UK to have the 
extremely rare spinal condition, spinal segmental dysgenesis of the 
lumbar spine, where the lower segment of her spine is missing. Earlier attempts to straighten her legs had been unsuccessful, leading doctors to consider the risky surgery.

Pioneering: Rosie received a bone graft from one of her amputated legs. Metal scaffolding was then implanted to support the spine

During the complex operation by a team of seven, Rosie’s lower legs were amputated where she 
had little or no feeling, and bone was taken from one of her legs and 
grafted to the base of her spine.

Two
15cm long rods were screwed in place – carefully avoiding the nerves – 
to create a type of 'scaffolding' from the upper part of her spine down to
the hip bone. The operation took a grueling 13 hours.

Before the operation Rosie did have some feeling in her lower body. At eight months old 
she was able to move herself around adopting a commando style crawl 
suggesting that her spine and nerves were working after all.

Now, after the operation Rosie 
already has more sensation in the upper part of her legs. It is a 
huge development and opens up the possibility that Rosie may one day walk using prosthetic limbs.

Ms Collett said: 'The only thing that Rosie has been 
unable to do is walk, which is her ultimate goal in life. After her 
operation and with the correct support we’re confident now that she will
be able to find a way to do that - to some degree.

'She loves her older 
sister Mia dearly, and has always aspired to be like her. She always 
says she would like to walk like Mia one day and that Mia would teach 
her.'

Mr Guirish Solanki, who was one of the three operating surgeons, said the team were very pleased with the results

Both she and Rosie's father Scott, thanked staff at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

'I know from talking to the surgeons that
there were some very tough decisions that needed to be made as the 
surgery progressed, and I am grateful for their ability to work through 
difficult circumstances to give our daughter the best chance of reaching
her full potential,' Ms Collett said.

Consultant Neurosurgeon Mr Guirish 
Solanki from Birmingham Children’s Hospital, who was one of the three 
surgeons to operate on Rosie, said: 'We
are delighted with the results of this operation. This is only the 
second time in the world that a surgical team has attempted to fix the 
thoracic spine to the hip side bones for a condition as rare as Rosie’s.

'This
case was very complicated as normally children with this condition do 
not have a working spinal cord or nerves but Rosie did. So in carrying 
out this procedure we had to be extremely careful not to damage her 
nerves.'
