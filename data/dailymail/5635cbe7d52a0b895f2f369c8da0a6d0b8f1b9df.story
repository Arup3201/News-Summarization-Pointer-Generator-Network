Four people have been killed in a plane crash close to the Bahamas yesterday.

The victims, believed to be US citizens, died when their plane crashed shortly after taking off from Grand Bahama Island at around 11am local time.

Wish TV has named the pilot as businessman Tony Wishart from Fishers, Indiana. Another man and two women were reported to have been on board.

According to reports the Americans were tourists taking part in a sightseeing tour.

Emrick Seymour, assistant police commissioner for Grand Bahama, said the Cirrus 22 plane crashed minutes after takeoff from the island's international airport.

He said the pilot radioed that the plane was 'experiencing some engine problems.'

According to Wthr.com the aircraft was registered to a company called First Class Flyers, LLC, in Cicero, Indiana

Exactly a week before this crash two other Americans had to be rescued after their twin-engine plane ditched into the sea near the Staniel Cay area

Officials says information about the victims' identities will not be released by Bahamian authorities until their next of kin have been informed. Seymour said police were 'right in the middle of the investigation.'

A statement from the police force said that the aircraft had been completely destroyed.

According to the Bahamas Civil Aviation Department, the group was on a local sightseeing flight in the area of Freeport, Grand Bahama when the aircraft apparently ditched in low waters approximately 7 miles North of the Freeport Control Tower.

The Bahamas has been the scene of several air crashes recently.

Exactly a week before the latest crash two men had to be rescued from the water near Staniel Cay after their twin-engine plane crashed.

The US coastguard sent a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter to lift the two men out of the water, who escaped unhurt.

Last year a helicopter crash killed one person and left another four injured near Bakerâ€™s Bay Golf and Ocean Club on Great Guana Cay after a strong gust of wind sent it spiralling out of control while trying to land.
