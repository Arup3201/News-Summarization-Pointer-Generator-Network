Missing: Erin Corwin, 19, has been missing since Saturday when she left her home and headed to a nature spot in Southern California

Authorities in Southern California are desperately searching for a pregnant 19-year-old woman who mysteriously vanished on the way to Joshua Tree National Park over the weekend.

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said Erin Corwin was last seen leaving home Saturday morning. She was driving a blue, 2013 Toyota Corolla with the license plate 7CJX519. An air and ground search failed to locate her. .

According to Sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman, ‘suspicious circumstances’ surround the woman's disappearance and foul play hasn't been ruled out. Homicide detectives reportedly have been involved in the investigation. 

Corwin is three months' pregnant. She and her husband, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and live at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms.

Mrs Corwin left her home at around 7am and headed to Joshua Tree located just 5 miles away from the Marine Corps base.

The expecting mother was planning to scope out a good location for a family gathering during a planned visit with her mother, but she never made it back.

On Sunday, her husband filed a missing persons report. The next day, Erin Corwin's car was found abandoned in Twentynine Palms.

The disappearance of Corwin, who has no known history of mental illness or substance abuse, has stunned her loved ones.

Corwin’s sister-in-law DeeAnna Heavilin said the 19-year-old is reserved and introverted, and it is not in her character to disappear.

Jonathan and Erin Corwin got married two years ago and moved to the Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms last fall after the husband returned from a posting in Japan.

While the Marine served overseas, Erin continued living with her parents in Tennessee.

The
 sister-in-law told Press-Enterprise the young husband and wife were living a charmed 
life together, with Erin spending most of her free time volunteering at a
 horse sanctuary.

The young woman is 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 120lbs with brown hair and blue eyes. According to the sheriff's department, she has no known mental health issues.
