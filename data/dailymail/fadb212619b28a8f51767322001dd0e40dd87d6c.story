When Oscar the cat went missing, offers from neighbours to help look for him were few and far between.

Instead, the atmosphere near his home was one of distinct relief.

For the residents of Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, thought they had at last seen the rather aggressive back of the five-year-old Turkish Van they nicknamed ‘Asbo cat’.

Oscar is said to have terrorised the 
area, attacking dogs and residents. One victim, retired lieutenant 
colonel Tom Ridgway, 77, spent six days in hospital after Oscar mauled 
his right arm and sank his teeth into his left thumb all the way to the 
bone.

Hungry: Oscar the cat was caught stealing food

But to the regret of Mr Ridgway and his neighbours, Oscar, who vanished on October 17, is now back home – safe and sound.

He turned up at an empty house in 
Northampton, 25 miles away, and had been muscling in on food put out for
 the owners’ pets by a cat sitter.

His behaviour was so bad the cat sitter has refused to help out ever again. Determined to get rid of  him, the homeowner had Oscar scanned by a vet, who found the details on his microchip.

He arrived back in Wingrave on Saturday – where villagers are arming themselves with water pistols. One, who asked not to be named, admitted many had hoped the only way Oscar would ever return would be ‘in a body bag’.

‘Children can’t walk down the alley to the school,’ said another. ‘They all know about the cat and they are all frightened it’s going to get them.’

Describing Oscar as ‘ferocious’, Mr Ridgway added: ‘He can be very aggressive and will even attack dogs and people around the village.’ Only owner Caroline Hughes, 36, was pleased at the return of Oscar, also known as the ‘Lion Cat of Wingrave’, who she has had since he was a kitten.

She said: ‘When I got the call I asked
 “Is he okay and alive?’’ The vet said “He’s very much alive and causing
 problems’’. I said “That’s Oscar – he’s okay’’. I am super-happy to 
have him back. I never ever gave up but I was definitely starting to 
lose faith. Life just wasn’t the same without him.

‘Because of his bad boy antics I 
hoped, if he was still okay, he would stay true to form and make himself
 known at a house where cats already lived and where somebody would know
 what to do rather than get angry with him.

‘It seems ironic now that it was his notorious bad behaviour that brought him back to me.’

But Miss Hughes, a telecoms worker, defended her pet, saying he was so lovable he had even appeared in an Ikea advert in 2010 – and insisted he never attacked children or dogs.

‘The fact that people are saying they want Oscar dead is awful.

'I can’t believe anyone would say that,’ she said. Miss Hughes is now looking into herbal therapy to treat Oscar’s aggression, and is planning to move to a house with a large and secure garden for him to roam. In the meantime, she has put him under house arrest.

Vans, originally from Lake Van in the east of modern Turkey, are a powerful breed sometimes referred to as ‘dogs in a cat suit’.

Loyal: Caroline Hughes defended her cat Oscar, claiming he has 'a lot of character'

She said she felt like she had to leave home because of the unfair way her neighbours were treating Oscar.

She said: 'Oscar has a lot of character.

'He is a lively cat but the accusations some people are making about him are just not true.

'He has never attacked children or dogs.

'Oscar did attack one of my neighbours once but my neighbour had scared him when he tried to pick him up.

'He even appeared in a IKEA TV commercial - so if he was that vicious how on earth would they have filmed him in that.

'The fact that people are saying they want Oscar dead is just awful - I can't believe anyone would say that.

'He is a great cat - it has all got too much and I think I am going to have to move home.'

Ms Hughes has two other cats, who are both Oscar's brothers.
