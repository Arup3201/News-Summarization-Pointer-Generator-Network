HIV self-testing kits could soon be for sale in the UK.

A change in UK law means that from Sunday it will be legal to sell the home testing kits.

However, it is unlikely that any will be seen on the shelves until late this year or early next year.

This is because none have currently been approved for sale in the UK or the EU.

Currently, people can take HIV tests at home but they have to send a saliva, or blood, sample to a lab which will give them their results after the sample has been analysed.

The change in the law means people will be able to buy tests that give them an immediate result that they can read themselves.

The tests work by analysing saliva samples that people take with a swab and are easily read from the test kits by people with no medical knowledge or training.

The law was changed in an attempt to ensure more people who are HIV positive are diagnosed and that they are diagnosed early.

This is important because about 25 per cent of HIV positive people in the UK do not know they are HIV positive and these are the people most likely to pass on the infection.

It is also important to ensure people are diagnosed as early as possible to make treatment as effective as it can be.

Michael Brady, Medical Director at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘We welcome this change in the law, which will give people another choice about how and where they test for HIV.

Currently, if people want to be tested for HIV they have to go to a doctor or a nurse. Alternatively they can take a blood or saliva sample at home and send it to a lab for analysis

‘The success of our HIV postal testing scheme has shown that many people who have never tested before, or who have been putting off a visit to the clinic, are willing to test at home.

‘With HIV transmission in the UK largely driven by the 22,000 people who remain undiagnosed, anything that provides them with another option to test and access effective treatment is welcome.

‘It is vital that HIV self-testing kits offer high quality information, including how to obtain practical and emotional support and how to quickly access specialist HIV services.

‘We will be working closely with manufacturers to ensure that any kit that comes to market meets the very best standards of patient information.’
