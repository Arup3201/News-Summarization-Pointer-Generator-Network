Southwest Airlines has landed an historic $1.6 million fine for keeping 16 Chicago flights on the tarmac for more than three hours.

Staffing shortages and a bad winter storm meant hundreds of passengers who flew into Midway Airport on January 2 last year were left in their seats for longer than federal regulations allow - some for more than four hours.

'We are disappointed that the government would seek additional money,' Southwest said in a statement, 'after the enormous penalties imposed on Southwest by Mother Nature during the January 2014 winter storms.' 

But the Department of Transportation (DOT) refused to accept the excuses and ordered the airline to pay $1.6 million.

Fined: Southwest Airlines has been ordered to pay $1.6 million for delaying 16 flights by more than three hours

The bill includes a $600,000 payment to the government and $269,000 in compensation to passengers.

It is the first time the DOT has ever fined Southwest.

'Airline passengers have rights, and the department's tarmac delay rules are meant to prevent passengers from being stuck on an aircraft on the ground for hours on end,' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said.

The calamity was caused by issues with Southwest's staff scheduling system, which meant they were understaffed.

The winter storm Hercules impacted problems, with subzero temperatures and heavy snow.

Landmark ruling: The Department for Transportation said the storm and staff shortages were not an excuse

But DOT regulations dictate that no flight should remain on the tarmac longer than three hours after landing.

Southwest directors insist they have altered their regulations and made investments that will prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.
