The United States has issued a global travel warning after recent terror attacks in France, Australia and Canada.

The alert by the U.S. Department of State comes hours after French police killed three hostage-takers in a pair of incidents.

Two of the men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, are believed to be responsible for Wednesday's attack on a satirical magazine in Paris, Charlie Hebdo.

Twelve people were killed in that assault, France's deadliest terror incident in decades.

The State Department's warning says attacks against Americans are becoming increasingly prevalent. 

'Recent terrorist attacks, whether by those affiliated with terrorist entities, copycats, or individual perpetrators, serve as a reminder that U.S. citizens need to maintain a high level of vigilance,' the Department said Friday.

It also cites an increased risk of reprisals against U.S. and Western targets for the U.S.-led intervention against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.

The bulletin notes the high 'degree of sophistication and advance weapons handling,' the terrorists displayed in the attack on Charlie Hebdo, NBC reports. 

The notice also provides information about threats that U.S. citizens might face abroad, citing potential threats in Europe, the middle east, Africa, and south, central, and east Asia.   

The bulletin stated that the attacker's 'confidence' in the attack indicated  prior training.

The warning also cited last month's hostage standoff at a Sydney cafe and the October killing of a soldier near Canada's parliament.
