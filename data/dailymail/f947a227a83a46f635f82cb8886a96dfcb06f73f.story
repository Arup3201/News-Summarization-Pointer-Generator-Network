Disgraced Canadian aviator Dellan Millard who was charged in the death of a young husband and father last May is now being accused of murdering his girlfriend and shooting dead his own father.

Millard, 28, of Toronto, was charged Thursday with two more counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of Wayne Millard and Laura Babcock.

The November 2012 death of the suspect's father was initially ruled a suicide; Miss Babcock disappeared in June 2012.

Murdered: Tim Bosma, 32, from Ontario, disappeared after taking two men out to test drive his pickup truck - which was advertised for sale online - on May 6, 2013

Millard was charged with first-degree murder last spring in connection to the killing of Tim Bosma, 32, from Ontario, National Post reported. .

Bosma's charred remains were discovered on Millard’s farm in May 2013 more than a week after he had vanished after taking two men out to test drive his truck he was planning to sell.

Millard’s new girlfriend, 21-year-old Christina Noudga, has been charged with accessory after the fact in Bosma's slaying. His friend Mark Smich, 26, faces murder charges in both the Bosma and Babcock cases.

Millard’s lawyer, Deepak Paradkar, said Thursday that his client is pleading guilty to the charges, suggesting that police are trying to turn the 28-year-old aviator into a serial killer by taking advantage of the notoriety of the Bosma murder.

Mr Paradkar also questioned the authorities' decision to reclassify his father's apparent suicide as a homicide two years after the fact.

Millard and Smich are expected back in court for a preliminary hearing in September, and their trial is set to get under way in the spring of 2015.

Millard is the scion of a failed aviation company, Millardair, which was started by his grandfather, retired pilot Carl Millard, in 1954. The charter airline went out of business in 1990.

The Millards also owned an airline maintenance venture, which Wayne Millard headed from 2006 until his death in 2012.

In his youth, Dellen Millard attended an elite private school in Toronto, where he reportedly shocked his classmates by eating dog treats in the hallways.

On his 14th birthday, Millard made international headlines when he became the youngest person in Canada to complete solo flights in both a plane and a helicopter.

Aside of his hereditary passion for aircraft, the young aviator also owned a collection of cars, which he souped up and raced.

After his father's shooting death, Millard took over the struggling family business, but it went under a short time later. 

But Millard still had substantial assets by the time he was arrested, with at least four valuable properties registered to his name, including his grandparents' million-dollar home in a Toronto suburb, a $1.4million apartment building, a farm and a condo in downtown Toronto, CBC reported.

Dellan Millard, sporting his signature pink Mohawk on his head, was arrested May 11, 2013, just five days after the disappearance of Tim Bosma, who had put up his Dodge Ram pickup truck for sale online.

Two men, believed to be Millard and Smich, answered the ad and arrived at Bosma's Ancaster home for a test drive. Bosma never made it back home to his wife, Sharlene, and his young daughter.

Three days later, police searched Millard's 45-hectare farm and discovered the missing man's badly burned body.

Police believe the two suspected killers used a livestock incinerator dubbed the Eliminator to dispose of the victim’s remains. Millard had no animals on his property.

In July 2012, Millard's girlfriend Laura Babcock, a 23-year-old graduate of University of Toronto, was reported missing. Her last sighting was June 26, The Toronto Star reported. According to her family, the last person Babcock spoke to was Millard.

Her former boyfriend Shawn Lerner has accused police of ignoring Babcock’s missing person case because she was a mentally unstable drug user who also dabbled in the sex trade. 

Her body was never recovered, but homicide detectives told The Spectator they are convinced that she had met the same fate as Tim Bosma.

Four months later, Wayne Millard was discovered dead in his Etobicoke home from what was believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the left side of his head.

The death was ruled a suicide and Mr Millard’s body was cremated.

On the occasion of his father's passing, Dellan Millard wrote a touching obituary in which he described his late parent as a humanitarian and a passionate animal activist.
