The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin serves as a solemn reminder of the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust.

It also serves as the backdrop for hundreds of gay and bisexual men using the austere grey concrete backdrop as a location to shoot their profile pictures for social app Grindr.

The images have been collected on the blog ‘Totem and Taboo: Grindr Remembers the Holocaust,’ and have caused considerable outrage over the political correctness of the location.

The memorial consists of 2,711 concrete slabs, encased on four acres of land in the heart of Berlin, and is a popular, if not sombre, tourist attraction for hundreds of thousands of people.

Included in that are men on Grindr trying to find casual hook-ups and make connections. Men from the site are pictured in various poses – and sometimes shirtless – amid the grey concrete slabs.

One blogger pictured making a steely glance for the camera wrote on his profile: ‘Remembering those who cannot text anymore.’

The blog, which was founded by Zion Afuta and Boris Cukierman, spells out its charter by saying that we live in an age ‘when ignorance is (sic) prevalent than ever,’ and Grindr has ‘wowed its members in relentlessly promoting the memory of the Holocaust.’

The Israeli-born blog founders live abroad; Mr Afuta in Berlin and Mr Cukierman in London, and told AbbaNibi that this unlikely tourist attraction became a backdrop for a specific sect of counterculture.

They explained: ‘Users seem to come from various places and from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Through the adoption of Grindr users, the monument gets in our blog a new role; not only as a space for grief and sadness, but also a site for hope, unity, and cruising.’

Neither Grindr nor 'Totem and Taboo's' founders immediately responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Grindr founder and CEO Joel Simkhai told
 Israeli entertainment site AbbaNibi in 2011 that he’s not in the least bit 
offended. ‘As a Jew and an Israeli, I’m deeply moved by how users are 
coming together as a community on Grindr to share and inspire others to 
take part in memory of the Holocaust,’ he said at the time.

But according to Salon, Grindr’s press representatives said the following on Wednesday: ‘What started as users expressing themselves on a topic not often discussed in social networking profiles, has now become disrespectful.

‘We strongly encourage our users to engage in a respectful manner and honor the memory of those who perished in outher ways outside of the app.’

‘While the gay community is being under scrutiny for promoting hedonism and alienation, this tribute seems all the more compelling.’

Heeb Magazine took a satirical jab at the phenomenon, saying: ‘The existence of Holocaust memorials like Yad Va’shem in Israel and the Berlin Holocaust memorial help (educate and share) with solemn dignity and introspective reverence.

‘Naturally, the gays had to come in and make it sexy.’

Many who saw the photos were outraged. ‘I can’t put exactly into words why I am insulted, but I am,’ one commenter wrote on Jezebel.

Another wrote: ‘While I am saddened that people use the denkmal as a place to have fun, it isn’t surprising, and it isn’t going to stop.’

But there were others who did not seem so offended by the photos. ‘He’s not going to flex his pecs at Auschwitz or at a cancer ward,’ one commenter wrote on Heeb’s website.

‘But like the large stone monoliths of the memorial, he is saying “f*** you” to the persecutors of Jews, Gypsies, and gay folk formerly headquartered in that neighborhood.’

Others simply thought that while these men pictured seemed to display a certain amount of cultural and historical ignorance, they weren’t specifically harming anyone.

As of March of last year, the site has some 3.5million users spread out in 192 countries. The company was founded in 2009. Now, users send more than 2million photographs to one another on a daily basis.

The Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

Only last week, survivors of the Holocaust gathered at the site to mark International Remembrance Day, placing wreathes and bouquets of flowers on the snow-covered slabs.

The date, January 27th, was chosen as it in 1945 marked the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi’s most notorious death camp.

It is estimated that more than 15,000 homosexual men and women were routinely executed during Hitler’s reign, with thousands more persecuted for their sexual orientation.
