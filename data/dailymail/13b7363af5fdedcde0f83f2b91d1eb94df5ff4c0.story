Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles

Hull City boss Steve Bruce is interested in replacing Alan Pardew as manager of Newcastle United and would be willing to work with owner Mike Ashley.

The Geordie boss is under increasing pressure at Hull after Sunday’s defeat at home to Leicester left them one place above the relegation zone on goal difference only.

And Bruce – who was sacked by Sunderland three years ago - would jump at the chance of a return to his native North East and the club he supported as a boy.

Steve Bruce - Boyhood Newcastle fan and under pressure at Hull. Would work under Mike Ashley and gets on well with chief scout Graham Carr. 4/1 

Tony Pulis – Out of work and an attractive proposition for Ashley in that respect. Thought to be interested. 7/2

Tim Sherwood – Would jump at the chance and possibility of bringing Newcastle favourite Les Ferdinand with him would be popular with supporters. 10/1

Steve McClaren – Doing a fine job at Derby and is respected within St James’ Park. He would find lure of return to Premier League hard to resist. 16/1

Glenn Hoddle – Has emerged as a popular choice among Toon Army and current QPR coach might fancy shot at top job. 20/1 

Fabricio Coloccini - The 32-year-old Argentine has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis. 15/8

Crucially, he has a good relationship with Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr and it is thought he would accept the transfer model which sees Carr identify the majority of targets.

Bruce, though, faces competition for the position from two out-of-work managers whose unemployment – and thus no compensation fee – would appeal to Ashley.

Tony Pulis has not worked since quitting Crystal Palace at the start of the season and is keen on a return to the dugout. Newcastle would represent the biggest club on his managerial CV and it is thought he is interested in succeeding close friend Pardew.

Likewise, Tim Sherwood. He was sacked by Spurs at the end of last season and was in the running for the Palace job before Pardew’s shock move to Selhurst Park.

Ashley has connections to Spurs and Sherwood will certainly be applying for the position on Tyneside. 

Were he to persuade former Newcastle favourite Les Ferdinand to join him as assistant then it could prove a shrewd move in appeasing supporters who are sceptical about Ashley’s motives in identifying a replacement.

One name which is proving popular with the Toon Army is that of former England boss Glenn Hoddle. The current QPR coach missed out on the job at Spurs when Sherwood was appointed last season and he has long since fancied another No.1 role.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who is currently in Barbados, will have the final say

John Carver, however, is set to be placed in temporary charge of first-team affairs. The Newcastle-born coach boasts a 100-per-cent record as caretaker boss having guided the Magpies to a 3-0 win over Blackburn in the wake of Sir Bobby Robson’s sacking in 2004.

Should he impress during a busy January period then a deal until the end of the season at least could be in the offing.

Steve McClaren, meanwhile, is rebuilding his reputation at Derby County but would be tempted by the offer from a Premier League club. He is respected within St James’ Park and is another used to working within the European model of transfers controlled at a level above the manager.
