A husband and wife duo managed to restrain an axe-wielding man who burst into their shop  and ordered a cashier to fill his bag with money.

Sab Dhillon, 46, who runs Shildon Post Office and Stores in County Durham, ran from the back of the store to pounce on the man.

After a scuffle Mr Dhillon managed to restrain the man in a stranglehold and his wife then appeared, further subduing the man - whose face was covered with a scarf and hood - by hitting him with a baseball bat.

CCTV of the store shows the shop assistant then pull off the man's mask so his face is shown to the cameras.

The incident took place at about 7.55pm on Sunday as the couple's 12-year-old son was also in the building. 

After the men burst into the store, both with their faces covered, one of them failed to get behind the counter.

The second man guarded the door but fled when Mr Dhillon ignored the danger and pounced on the first man from behind.

The pair fell against shelves in the  store, knocking items to the ground.

Mr Dhillon managed to force the man to the floor where he placed him in a stranglehold - while the other man fled.

Meanwhile, Mr Dhillon's wife, Sam, 40, arrived and used her son's baseball bat to help further subdue the man until police arrived. 

Ms Brighty also helped restrain him.

Mr Dhillon said: 'I was in the back of the shop on the computer and I noticed two lads walk in and then I heard Andrea shouting.

'I saw the axe and I just ran at him and we ended up having a scuffle. 'The whole thing was pure instinct, I didn't have time to think.

'I think everyone imagines these situations when they work in retail but you never think it will actually happen to you.

'To be honest I am a little bit surprised by my own actions and I can't believe I did what I did. 'I had him round the neck and I just held him there until the police arrived.

'I managed to get the axe off him. 

'I put him in a choke hold, again instinctively, I don't know why I thought of that.

'I just wanted to protect my staff and make sure that no of them get hurt. We have been here for five years, there has been a couple of minor incidents but nothing at this level.

Mrs Dhillon said the incident had made them more cautious especially late at night.

She said: 'My husband's brave for what he did. He put his life in danger and it was scary.'
