With Thanksgiving just around the corner, time is fast approaching for Americans countrywide to show their gratitude for the food on their plates.

But then again there may be one or two who'll be more grateful going hungry on November 28th than tuck into any of these home-cooked horrors.

The profoundly unappetizing selection of images have been compiled on an Instagram account called cookingforbae, in a bid to chronicle quite how bad bad cooking can be.

They range from sausage and mush to pancakes that look like pork chops and cheese that could be insulator foam to shiny shepherd's pie.

But the majority of dishes are downright indistinguishable and don't even have an explanation on the Instagram account, suggesting the cooks themselves weren't entirely sure what they'd made.

Bangers and mush: It's hard to know what many of the items of food are

To die from: This is a broccoli cheese casserole, according to the cook who conceived it

Shepherd's Cry: Cookingforbae says this monstrosity is a shepherd's pie but it's hard to tell

Pork or pancake? According to the post on cookingforbae, these are actually pancakes doused in syrup. Although many of cookingforbae's followers mistook them for pork chops

Rather eat your heart out? It is unclear exactly what is on this plate. Apart from what looks suspiciously like an omelet, the rest is indistinguishable

Not on your sausage: Here are just two of the many ways you can cook frankfurter sausages

Sludge: The majority of dishes don't even have an explanation on the Instagram account, suggesting the cooks themselves weren't entirely sure what they'd made

Questionable: The pictures are enough to make even the most strong-stomached eater reach for the sick bag

The romance killer: The poster of this picture was cooking for her boyfriend. But this dish is sure to kill any romance

Goo do you think you're kidding? Apparently this is oatmeal porridge and bake but it could be any number of things

Ribs of squid? There is no explanation, or excuse, for this kind of cooking

What the shell is that? This elegantly presented lobster platter may not look tasty but that hasn't stopped the person holding the plate from piling it on

A bit of a pickle: The only distinguishable food stuff in this dinner is the pickle garnish and the pasta. The rest is anybody's guess

Who knows? The poster of this picture said he'd rather eat the blue plate than taste what's on it

Pink surprise: This is apparently leftovers of a Sunday roast. It is unclear what the pink and purple side order is, though

Eye-watering: Some of the chefs are so accomplished at cooking badly that they compiled montages of their concoctions

No idea: The sight alone of some of these dishes is enough to make your eyes water
