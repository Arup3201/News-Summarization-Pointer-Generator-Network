Biking hero: Many cycling enthusiasts have been inspired by the success of Sir Bradley Wiggins

Sales of prostate products have increased as biking has become the new way of keeping fit among middle-aged men.

Known as MAMILs - middle-aged men in lycra – they have become a common sight on country roads and city streets, following the success of Sir Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Tour de France and Team GB at the London Olympics.

As British Cycling’s memberships have increased by 50 per cent in the past two years, sales of prostate products have quadrupled among customers aged between 40 and 45 in 2013, an online chemist reports.

The link between cycling and prostate 
problems has been documented in The Sports Medicine Book by Dr. Gabe 
Mirkin, which revealed that genital numbness, swelling, and pressure on 
the prostate were common side effects of cycling.

On rare occasions, cases of infertility, blood in the urine or inflammation of the prostate were also reported, he says.

Incidents of prostate problems caused by cycling were the result of 
compression of the prostate from sitting in the saddle for long periods 
of time, researchers
 at Tel Aviv University found.

ChemistDirect Superintendent Pharmacist, Omar El-Gohary said:  ‘Cycling is not directly linked to prostate problems, but repetitive 
trauma to the prostate on the saddle can occur which can lead to 
inflammation of the prostate.

The biggest increase in sales of prostate products has been seen in the South East, which saw an annual increase of 20 per cent.

The East saw a 15 per cent rise total rise and the South West 10 per cent, ChemistDirect said.

Sales of prostate products including Flomax Relief, Healthaid Prostavital, Saw Palmetto and iMan Prostate Health Formula + at ChemistDirect rose by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013.

Prostate problems tend to affect nearly 50 per cent men over the age of 50 and as many as 90 per cent of men in their seventies and eighties.

‘But we have seen a steady increase in sales for prostate products over the last year, particularly amongst younger men in their 40s,' said Mr El-Gohary.

He believes the surge may be down to the boom in 
cycling. In October, British Cycling, the UK cycling governing body, 
reported that membership had surpassed 80,000, a rise of more than 50 
per cent following Sir Bradley Wiggins’ win at the 2012 Tour de France.

Risky business: The rise of the MAMIL - middle aged man in lycra - may have had consequences, as sales of prostate products quadrupled for customers aged 40 to 45 in 2013

Retail analyst Mintel also revealed last year that half of all British men cycle, with the overall growth in bike sales propelled by men aged 35-45.

Mr El-Gohary added: ‘If you are feeling pain when cycling, assess whether the pain subsides when you get off the saddle.

'If the pain remains, and is accompanied by other problems such as urinary problems or erectile dysfunction, you should book an appointment with your doctor.’

Finding ways to reduce pressure on the groin area (as the prostate is located just below the bladder), such as regularly standing on the pedals to wearing padded shorts, can help.

A study in the British Journal of Urology International showed that grooved seating produced less numbness in the penile area and impact on erectile dysfunction, but also, the position of the ride is key.

As a result, more bike manufacturers are now making bikes with specially fitted saddles.
