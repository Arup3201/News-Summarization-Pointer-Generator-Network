A police officer was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide after investigators concluded she shot an unarmed motorist in the back as he lay facedown after a traffic stop over an expired inspection sticker.

Authorities accused Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J. Mearkle of shooting David Kassick, 59, twice February 2 without legal justification. She was jailed without bail.

They said Mearkle had attempted to pull over Kassick for expired inspection and emissions stickers before he sped away. She caught up to Kassick near his sister's home, where he got out and ran.

She had incapacitated him with a stun gun and he was on the ground when she shot him twice in the back, police said.

Necessary? Prosecutors say Mearkle shot dead Kassick when he was lying facedown on the ground and didn't present any danger. She has contested that she saw him reach into his jacket - possibly for a weapon. However, he was unarmed. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday in handcuffs 

Mearkle was later released on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device 

Victim: Last month, one of Kassick's (pictured) brothers said he had struggled with drug addition but was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. He was working as a construction worker at the time of his death last month

Mearkle, 36, told investigators she shot because he would not show her his hands and she thought he was reaching into his jacket for a gun.

The stun gun recorded portions of the encounter, and District Attorney Ed Marsico called it the strongest evidence in the case.

He said it appeared Kassick had been trying to remove stun-gun probes from his back.

'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow covered lawn with his face toward the ground,' according to the arrest affidavit. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' 

Marsico said Mearkle performed CPR after the shooting. He called the shooting 'a tragedy for all involved.'

In the wake of Tuesday's announcement, Kassick's younger brother Dale Kassick spoke out, saying: 'Nothing is going to bring my brother back. He should have never lost his life over a traffic stop.'

However, Dale said he and the rest of his family were thankful for the community's support in the past month and the prompt filing of charges.

'It's not being swept under the rug, it's not being forgotten about,' Dale said.

Last month, Kassick's older brother Dan said his brother had struggled with drug addition in his life. However, he said the construction worker was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer.

Serious allegations: Mearkle pictured above entered court on Tuesday, before the arraignment 

The DA said a syringe was found near Kassick's body, and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died.

Mearkle's lawyer did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment, nor did Hummelstown Chief Charles M. Dowell.

The police department issued a news release that said it had cooperated fully, calling the matter 'an extremely difficult case for all involved.'

'We are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,' the news release stated.

The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned.

Mearkle was released this afternoon on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device at home.  

Important announcement: Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Mrisco announced the charges against Mearkle at an afternoon press conference on Tuesday
