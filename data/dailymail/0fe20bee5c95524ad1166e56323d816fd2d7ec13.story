Dramatic footage has emerged showing a man being violently catapulted towards a tree in Tarbes, France.

The one-minute clip shows the top of the tree falling to the ground, causing the tethered man to be flung towards it.

The amateur lumberjack had a rope tied around his waist with one end tethered to the sapling, which was supposed to act as a counterweight.
