Nick Clegg has called for a major rethink of plans to monitor people’s phone records and internet use.

The Deputy Prime Minister ordered Home Secretary Theresa May 'back to the drawing board' after a parliamentary committee expressed ‘serious concerns’ about the so-called snoopers’ charter.

MPs and peers accused ministers of using ‘fanciful and misleading’ figures to back up its proposals to give police and security services sweeping powers to access communications data.

Coalition clash: Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg seized on 'serious criticisms' by MPs and peers to insist Tory Home Secretary Theresa May rethink her plans to monitor phone and internet use

They said the proposed laws, which would
force internet and phone firms to store masses of information about 
emails, phone calls and internet clicks, go much further than is 
necessary and amount to overkill.

Mr Clegg said that the 'serious criticisms' meant the government’s draft Data Communications Bill must be ripped up.

But Mrs May insisted she will 'not allow these vitally important laws to be delayed any longer in this Parliament'.

The row triggered one of the most dramatic coalition splits since the controversial Health and Social Care Bill was 'paused' after Lib Dems expressed grave doubts about its contents.

Mr Clegg was delighted to find the joint committee of MPs and peers agreed with his concerns about giving police and security services access to phone and internet records.

The Deputy PM said: 'Their report makes a number of serious criticisms – not least on scope; proportionality; cost; checks and balances; and the need for much wider consultation.

‘It is for those reasons that I believe the Coalition Government needs to have a fundamental rethink.

‘We cannot proceed with this bill and we have to go back to the drawing board.’

Has caused deep unease: Officials will be able to see the address of every website visited, along with details of Skype phone calls and use of gaming websites

Mrs May insisted however that, while 
she would consider the report’s findings, the Government must forge 
ahead with the legislation in the current parliament. She reminded the 
Lib Dems they had agreed to the inclusion of the law in the strategic 
defence review (SDR) of 2010.

She
said: ‘This is a Government commitment. It was put in the SDR because 
it was recognised this was so important to be able to continue to 
protect the UK from a number of threats, including paedophiles and 
terrorists.’ 

Today James Brokenshire, a junior Tory Home Office minister, conceded there was 'workn that needs to be done'.

'There
is a legitimate debate to be had over the balance between security and 
individual liberty,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

There
is a gap in what the police is able to do at the moment. We believe 
that the changes that meet the substance of [the report's] 
recommendations can be made in reasonably short order, but we know that 
we need to work this through with the coalition, recognising that the 
Deputy Prime Minister has set out his concerns.

'There
are always differences in the coalition, that’s what coalition is all 
about. This is about saving lives and protecting the public.'

Under the plan, internet and phone 
companies will be compelled by law to store the information for a year. 
It can then be accessed on a case-by-case basis in relation to terrorist
cases or ‘serious crime’.

Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Julian
Huppert warned: 'It is very, very dangerous once you start collecting 
huge amounts of data on literally everybody on the country... that is 
incredibly dangerous.'

Mr Huppert said many people would be 'uncomfortable' that websites they visited, such as for abortion 
providers or marriage counsellors, were logged.

He also expressed concerns that the location a text was sent from could be stored.

Officials will be able to see the 
address of every website visited, along with details of Skype phone 
calls and use of gaming websites.

They
point out they only want to be able to find out when a call was made 
and to whom – not what was said. The idea has caused deep unease among 
backbench Lib Dem and Tory MPs, prompting Mr Clegg to demand an inquiry 
by the joint parliamentary committee.

Yesterday, the MPs and peers broadly accepted the case for some further powers to monitor higher levels of communications data.

But, in a highly critical report, they called for the draft bill to be substantially rewritten. They said Mrs May would be given ‘sweeping powers to issue secret notices’ ordering communications companies to disclose ‘potentially limitless’ categories of data.

The report found the Government had exaggerated the financial benefits of the £1.8billion proposal. Westminster’s intelligence and security committee, which monitors the work of the security services, said that without the new powers there would be a ‘serious impact’ on the work of MI5 and MI6.

But Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This report casts doubt on the security case for such sweeping surveillance powers.’

And Isabella Sankey, director of policy for the campaign group Liberty, said: ‘The Government has been sent back to the drawing board by this cross-party committee. ‘It is clear that a proper public consultation would leave this snoopers’ charter, not just in the long grass, but dead and buried.’

Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert, who sat on the committee, said the bill was ‘far too broad, very expensive, poorly evidenced and potentially unworkable’.

Analysis by James Slack

Politicians have been trying to pass new snooping laws for the past four years amid ferocious opposition from civil liberties groups. Jacqui Smith, the authoritarian Labour Home Secretary, failed in 2008 in a bid to introduce a massive database containing details of every internet visit, phone call and email.

The Tories and Lib Dems, who opposed the Smith blueprint, then revived the idea two years later. It was included in the government’s strategic defence review (though not the Coalition agreement).

Theresa May argues there are crucial differences between the Labour plan and her own. The most important distinction is that the internet and phone companies will keep the data – not a state database which could be abused or hacked.

However, the joint committee of MPs and peers says the Home Secretary’s proposal is very similar to the Smith proposal.

Her bill would force communications providers to keep databases of emails, phone calls and other data for 12 months.

Each database could then be accessed round the clock by the government’s request filter, a computer system available to police and security officials.

The MPs and peers say: ‘So the same data is being stored about the same people and it is being stored in databases which are accessible to public authorities given powers under the bill.

‘The difference is that instead of one database there are many and they are privately owned.

Difficult position deciding what to next: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the Opposition would back or oppose the bill

Although they are privately owned the
government can stipulate what should be held on them, for how long, and
in what format it should be supplied.

‘The
differences therefore are not as great as the Home Office suggests; the
request filter can be equated to a federated database.’

To
give an example of the scope of these powers, the report says it would 
be possible for the authorities to use the filter to ‘list all persons 
who are the designated user of a mobile phone that was in London (eg 
Trafalgar Square) at time (eg noon last Tuesday)’. 

When deciding how much they want the draft bill to be amended, MPs will doubtless have the request filter in their sights.

But
both the Lib Dems and Labour are in a difficult position when deciding 
what steps to take next. Last night, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper
issued a lengthy statement which failed to say whether the Opposition 
would back or oppose the bill.

Their problem is that they have supported an even tougher version of the legislation in government so would appear opportunistic if they voted against now.

Mr Clegg, meanwhile, is confronted by the fact that the joint committee – while scathing over the detail of the draft bill – accepted the principle that some new snooping powers are needed. He is likely to demand significant concessions, while stopping short of demands from his party to ditch the bill.

The legislation does not have implications for the Data Protection Act, which covers personal information which police can hold about a person.

Communications data is currently governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which would be updated by the draft bill.
