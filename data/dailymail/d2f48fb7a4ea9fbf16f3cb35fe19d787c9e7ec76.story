Samantha Cameron gave a respectful nod to Margaret Thatcher today as she arrived for the great leader's funeral wearing a pussy-bow blouse - the very distinctive style of blouse made popular by Baroness Thatcher herself.

Mrs Cameron could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute - unless it had been blue, of course - to pay her respects to Britain's first female Prime Minister and longest serving PM in 150 years.

Paying respects: Samantha wore a pussy-bow blouse by French label Paul & Joe for the funeral of Baroness Thatcher today, no doubt in tribute to the Iron Lady's fondness for the style

Distinctive style: Mrs Cameron could not have chosen a more fitting sartorial tribute, 
looking elegant but demure as she arrived at Westminster Abbey with her 
husband

True blues: Samantha held the PM's hand as they walked to the service, a dark wool coat worn over her skirt and Paul & Joe blouse and an elegant sinamay hat

Style match: Mrs Cameron is known for her excellent style and today the PM's wife dressed entirely appropriately for the occasion. Left, Thatcher wearing one of the tie-neck blouses she adored

Thatcher frequently wore the feminine style - 
buttoned up to the neck with the voluminous silk ties knotted in a bow at her throat - 
to soften the power suits that were the other weapon in her style 
artillery.

If smartly 
cut jackets, sensible skirts and large shoulder pads gave Thatcher 
presence and the masculine edge that helped her dominate in a man's 
world, the addition of those pussy-bow blouses - Thatcher herself called them 'softening and pretty - rounded the edges of the masculine look.

Margaret Hilda Thatcher may have been an indefatigable politician and imposing opponent - but she understood the power of the correct clothes.

Always well dressed - she famously took advice from Gordon Reece that led her to leave her easy-to-mock hats behind and dress in a more approachable way - she often said it was not 'unfeminine to be well-tailored'.

Indeed, she said, 'it often perhaps concentrates
on what you are going to say if you have got well-tailored things on 
because people no longer look at your clothes.'

Thanks in part to Margaret Thatcher, the pussy-bow blouse became a style that dominated the 1980s. And despite humble beginnings - the daughter of a dressmaker, Baroness Thatcher and her sister, Muriel, grew up wearing home made clothes - Thatcher went on to be a very savvy dresser.

But it
was not until Thatcher met her wealthy future husband, Denis, that she 
could afford to spend a lot of money on outfits.

She soon forged her 
trademark style of colourful suits, hats, handbags, pearls - and, of course, those blouses.

Feminine touch: Thatcher said she often wore pussy-bow blouses because they were 'rather softening and pretty'

Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately - and that didn't mean forgoing femininity

The former Conservative leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire TV in 1985, saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish.

She said: 'What you do is decide the clothes in which you are comfortable. You must be comfortable. You are going to a great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in.

It must be a fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.'

While the Baroness knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously, she also did not want to lose her femininity.

'You do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a Prime Minister,' she said.

This is why she loved her pussy-bow blouse so much. 'I often wear bows; they are rather softening, they are rather pretty,' she said.
