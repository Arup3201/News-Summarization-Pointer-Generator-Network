Seb Larsson has hailed Sunderland’s fourth straight Tyne-Wear derby victory as their best yet.

The Black Cats made their own piece of derby history when Adam Johnson volleyed the only goal in stoppage time on Sunday to complete a quartet of wins for the first time in 116 years of the rivalry.

Larsson, along with Johnson and skipper John O’Shea, are the only players to appear in all four matches.

Adam Johnson fires Sunderland into a 1-0 lead to earn all three points for Gus Poyet's side against Newcastle

And the Sweden midfielder said: ‘It doesn't get much better than that. It tops the two performances when we won 3-0.

‘I know that might sound a bit strange but to get the winner that late is a fantastic feeling.

‘I do think we deserved it as well. We had by far the better chances but the way the last few games have gone, we haven't really scored so you get nervous towards the end.

‘But when you get such a late winner like that, the relief is something else. It was one of the better days I have had.

‘When you can give our fans something like that to enjoy just before Christmas it’s not too bad.’

Sunderland were headed for a sixth goalless draw of the season until Johnson struck.

Just last week manager Gus Poyet expressed his boredom with his side’s lack of cutting edge and a run of results which had seen them draw five in six.

And Larsson said: ‘The way things have been going recently we have been missing a lot of chances and you get to thinking is it another one of those? ‘We were scared of conceding as well but thankfully Johnno managed to stick that chance in and we’re delighted to get the three points.

‘Hopefully this is the one game that will really kick us on and get us some wins now.

‘These derbies are amazing to be involved in but you really don't want to be on the losing end of them.’
