A mother taking her two young daughters to school was elbowed to the floor by a woman who shouted at her and two other parents for blocking the path.

Kirsty Livingstone, 28, was standing with other mothers and their pushchairs on a street in Southborne, Dorset, when she was knocked down by 34-year-old Telicia Henry.

Miss Livingstone suffered whiplash, a chipped shoulder bone and severe bruising from the fall.

Seconds before, Henry, who had recently emerged from an off-licence, started shouting and swearing at the group before angrily barging past.

After the assault, she continued to school and picked up her children Lillie, five, and Ella, seven, before calling police.

The pain from the injuries gave Miss Livingstone sleepless nights and has made her nervous of going outside, a court heard.

Officers arrested Henry, of no fixed abode, who later appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court where she pleaded guilty to common assault and received a six-week suspended prison sentence.

Mark Price, defending, said: 'When this offence happened she was faced with a crowd of mothers and pushchairs and couldn’t get past.

'So she forced her way through forcefully - it wasn’t a reckless assault.'

In a statement read to the court, Miss Livingstone said the assault left her unable to sleep for three nights because of the pain and she lost her confidence when out walking.

Henry was told: 'This offence was committed in a group of ladies with children around.

'The abusive language you used was totally unacceptable and resulted in the lady being totally and utterly intimidated.'

After the case Miss Livingstone, a part-time shop assistant, said: 'I was with some other mums and we had seen the woman go into an off-licence.

'We had about 20 minutes until we had to pick up the children from school.

'Then the woman came down the road and approached us. She elbowed me so hard that I fell over.

'I was in absolute shock, she could have easily avoided me but she knew what she wanted to do.

'I went to collect my children from school and when I got there I burst out crying and had a cup of tea with one of the teachers who called the police.

'The next day I went to hospital and discovered I had severe whiplash and a chipped bone in my shoulder. My arm was in a sling for two weeks because of it.'
