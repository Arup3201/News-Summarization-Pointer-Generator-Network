David Archer, who is thought to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter, has been jailed for his 342nd offence

A man who is thought to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter has been jailed for his 342nd offence.

David Archer, who targets charity shops, was jailed today for a total of 18 months after admitting two new shoplifting offences and two breaches of an ASBO.

The 58-year-old homeless man, who had been staying in Mostyn, in Flintshire, admitted stealing clothing and a camera from an RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and a Carer's Trust charity box from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction, as well as two breaches of an ASBO banning him from charity shops.

Mold Crown Court heard how he wrote a letter to the judge saying he had in the past donated to charities because he appreciated the work they did. He said he had stolen because he wanted to keep warm during the cold weather.

But Judge Rhys Rowlands asked the defendant, who is said to have started stealing at the age of ten, how stealing a charity box or a camera would help keep him warm.

He said: 'I don't know if he takes me for a fool, but I am not. I don't accept a word of what he says in relation to that.'

The court was told Archer had 338 previous convictions - 261 for shoplifting, other thefts and burglary, along with 11 previous convictions for breaching an ASBO which bans him from all charity shops and prevents him possessing a charity box.

It was almost 48 years since he first offended at the age of ten by stealing from a shop in Denbigh.

Judge Rowlands said he 'shuddered to think' what Archer must have cost his victims and the state over the years.

'You have a dreadful record and a history of targeting charities,' he said. 'You have repeatedly chosen to breach the ASBO now on 13 occasions.

'It is one of the most depressing criminal records that I have seen for a while.'

The judge said it would be unjust to ignore that Archer's victims were charities.

'Rarely does a court have to deal with someone so determined to breach an order designed to protect charitable institutions,' he said.

Archer was jailed for stealing a charity box for The Carer's Trust from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction

Prosecutor Gareth Parry told how Archer stole clothing and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and a Carer's Trust charity box from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction.

He also admitted two breaches of an indefinite ASBO imposed in 2006 which, among other things, prohibited him from entering any charity shop in England and Wales and from possessing charity boxes.

Mr Parry said Archer was seen on CCTV burning a piece of string which secured the charity box in aid of carers, which was on the counter at the Llandudno Junction store. He bought a bottle of brandy but hid the charity box in his clothing.

He was seen stealing from the RSPCA shop and police were alerted.

Archer also admitted stealing clothing and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and two breaches of an ASBO

In mitigation, Andrew McInnes said Archer had been released from prison without funds and had nowhere to live.

Archer - who claims to have spent 28 years in prison and every Christmas but one in the last 40 behind bars - was stuck in a cycle of being released, re-offending because of his difficulties with alcohol and drugs and then being sent back to prison.

The court heard he was motivated to change but there was no hostel accommodation available to him.

The court was told the defendant had no contact with his family, suffered from osteoporosis and wanted to change his ways.Â
