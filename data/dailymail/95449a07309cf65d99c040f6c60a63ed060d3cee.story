Fraudsters sold an Australian woman's house without her knowledge while she was living overseas in South Africa.

The home in Macgregor, Canberra, was sold four months ago, but its owner only found out after asking her estate agent why rental payments were late.

It
 is just the latest in a spate of fraudulent sales and now authorities 
in Australia are warning homeowners and potential buyers to be on the 
lookout for property scams.

Macgregor in Canberra: Fraudsters sold an woman's house in the suburb without her knowledge

As
 well as the most recent case in Australian Capital Territory, 
authorities Western Australia are aware of two successful and six 
attempted real estate frauds.

All have involved owners of Australian property who now live in either South Africa or Nigeria.

Canberra
 police are understood to have consulted with police in South Africa as 
they investigate the fraudulent sale in Macgregor.

The
 Telegraph quoted a spokesman as saying: 'Police will investigate a 
series of exchanges which led to the sale of the property without the 
owner's knowledge or consent, and the disbursement of the funds 
generated by the deception.'

Police
 say home owners who live overseas should set up robust protocols to 
protect and confirm their bona fides in dealing with real estate agents.

For example, home owners could have a security question only they and their property manager know the answer to.

ACT
 Attorney-General Simon Corbell says all professionals involved in 
property sales need to be vigilant and exercise due diligence.

'Particularly when dealing with overseas transactions, check if you are in any doubt,' he said.
