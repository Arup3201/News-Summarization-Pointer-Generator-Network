Julie Bishop may be behind her leader but one of Tony Abbott's team has become the first to openly call for the Prime Minister to resign.

West Australian backbencher Dennis Jensen has called for the Liberal Party to move to oust Mr Abbott, adding 'the more quickly you do this, the better'.

'I believe that it is necessary that this is brought to a head and lanced,' Dr Jensen told the ABC on Tuesday.

West Australian backbencher Dennis Jensen has called for the Liberal Party to  oust the Prime Minister, saying: 'He is not focused on policy. He is not focused on strategic direction. He is focused more on tactics and tactical policy'

He said he had informed Mr Abbott of his lack of support on January 23 via text message after deciding the party was 'not governing as we should be…there is no strategic direction, the policy is not consistent and coherent'.

'He is not focused on policy. He is not focused on strategic direction. He is focused more on tactics and tactical policy,' Dr Jensen said of the Prime Minister, according to the ABC.

The backbencher said that while he did not want to be seen as the person 'pulling the trigger', he knew of a number of MP's who 'feel similarly', adding: 'I thought it was time to strike to start things moving,' Fairfax reports.  

Dr Jensen was involved in calling the first of the Liberal spills in 2009 that ultimately saw Mr Abbott installed as the party's leader. Now, Mr Abbott is under pressure to improve his performance.

Two Queensland MP's, including Warren Entsch and Mal Brough, plan to resolve the leadership problem when the party room meets in Canberra next Tuesday

'I have issues and I'm hoping to work through with the prime minister,' Mr Brough said.

'The matter needs to be resolved and if Tuesday is the appropriate time for people to talk about it ... then it's for them to say so.'

It comes just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a definitive statement to Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon saying she will not mount a leadership challenge against Mr Abbott.

Her announcement was made in order to quiet speculation she was counting numbers to unseat the Prime Minister after reports surfaced that she had refused to give an assurance to Mr Abbott that she would not run against him in a spill for the Coalition leadership.

'I am not campaigning for the job of Prime Minister, I will not challenge the leader,' she told Cabinet, Sky News reports. 

'I am not ringing the backbench asking for support, I'm not counting numbers.'

No challenge: Tony Abbott met with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Sunday afternoon and asked her not to run against him for leadership of the Liberal party

Mr Abbott has been under heavy fire since announcing his decision on Australia Day to knight Prince Philip and reports that he met with Ms Bishop on Sunday seek a guarantee that he enjoyed her full support. 

Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters after leaving the meeting to address the RBA interest rate cut: 'I have no doubt at all that Julie Bishop is absolutely 100 per cent supportive of the Prime Minister.'

It comes after Mr Abbott was ambushed by TV host Leigh Sales after she stepped out of the studio to question him at a childcare centre.   

Tony Abbott was visiting the Little Pines Centre in Sydney with his wife Margie on Tuesday when he was ambushed by ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales over leadership speculation

In the fiery exchange, veteran journalist Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership

The Prime Minister refused to answer when Sales asked him if he had sought assurance from Ms Bishop that she wouldn't challenge him.

'Look, Julie and I have lots of talks, as you'd expect. We're friends, we're colleagues, we're part of the leadership team and we support each other,' he said.

In the fiery exchange, Sales asked Mr Abbott if he would 'bring on a spill' to put an end to speculation about the Liberal leadership. 

'You're the speculator, Leigh, not me,' Mr Abbott hit back. 

Sales pushed Mr Abbott saying 'I assure you that a lot of people on the backbench are speculating as well, Prime Minister.'

'Leigh, the thing is that we were elected because people were sick of chaos. That's why we were elected – people were sick of chaos,' Mr Abbott said.

'And what I am determined to do is give Australia back the certainty and stability that people crave. People want a government which is focused on doing the right thing by them, not focused on itself.'

Sales poked fun at his repeated attempts to dodge the tough questions when she tweeted a photo of Mr Abbott playing with children at the Little Pines Centre with his wife Margie.

'The PM @tonyabbottmhr taking a few tricky questions from the punters,' the caption read.

The ABC told Daily Mail Australia that Sales liked to get out of the studio as much as possible and went to press conferences from time to time.

Mr Abbott also refused to deny reports he met with Ms Bishop and asked her not to mount a challenge when he appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Tuesday morning.  

'I think people find all that insider Canberra stuff boring,' he told Channel Seven's Sunrise.

'I have meetings with Julie Bishop all the time.'

When asked repeatedly if he asked Ms Bishop not to challenge, Mr Abbott said: 'I'm not going to play these Canberra insider games'.

'What (people) are looking for is politicians who are not endlessly navel gazing, not fighting amongst themselves, but are getting on with the government of this country,' he said. 

Ms Bishop reportedly refused  the commitment because she was angered by news reports at the weekend that she had told Mr Abbott she wouldn't challenge.

Treasurer Joe Hockey dismissed reports Ms Bishop declined to give  a commitment.

'Unsourced gossip,' he said when asked about the Sky News report on Channel Nine's Today show.

It comes as Mr Abbott made it clear during a major speech in Canberra on Monday that he would not give up the top job amid speculation of a leadership challenge. 

'We were elected in 2013 because the Australian people rejected chaos,' he said. 

'It's the people that hire and frankly it's the people that should fire.'

The Prime Minister has been shaken by various blows in recent weeks, including the Liberal National Party loss at the Queensland state election at the weekend.

Mr Abbott said of Ms Bishop: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.'

Mr Abbott was also widely criticised for knighting Prince Philip on Australia Day.

With leadership speculation rife in recent days, Mr Abbott warned on Monday that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past as he dumped his Paid Parental Leave scheme.

'The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years cannot become the new normal lest Australia join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck,' he said.

'I never came into politics to be popular.'

He also made mention of Ms Bishop saying: 'She's a friend of mine, Julie's my deputy, she's been a terrific deputy, been a terrific minister, I believe I have her full support.'
