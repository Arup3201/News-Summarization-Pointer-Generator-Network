A solicitor who knocked himself unconscious on his stag do after plummeting down a flight of stairs dressed as a nurse believes it was the quick-thinking of air ambulance medics that saved his life.

Andrew Croft tumbled down the stairs at the Round House pub in Covent Garden, London while celebrating his impending nuptials last March. 

The 29-year-old was knocked unconscious and an ambulance was called.

London's Air Ambulance responded, sending a crew to the scene in a rapid response car, with an ambulance following.

A doctor immediately gave Mr Croft an anaesthetic - the act he believes saved his life.

Andrew Croft, 29, from Kennington in south London, fell down a flight of stairs while dressed as a nurse on his stag do in Covent Garden

But thanks to the quick actions of London's Air Ambulance, the solicitor's life was saved and he walked down the aisle six weeks later to marry his girlfriend Fiona

The air ambulance crew, who arrived at the pub in a fast-response car, administered a rapid sequence induction (RSI) anaesthetic to put him to sleep and reduce the risk of brain damage. 

Mr Croft, of Kennington, south London, said he can't remember anything about the incident.

But he was able to recover and walked down the aisle six weeks later.

'I'm really lucky to be back to normal with no long term ill effects,' he said.

'I was told that if I'd been left in the position that the air ambulance medics found me I might not have made it through.

'I left work to go to the stag do last March, and I don't remember anything about it after that.

'I think it's the accident. Because of hitting my head it just wiped out my memory.' 

Watching Mr Croft recovering in hospital, his fiance Fiona, 29, agonised over whether to cancel the May wedding. 

She and his family remained at his bedside at the Royal London hospital for four days, and while he recuperated at St Thomas's hospital. 

'We were lucky - we didn't have to rearrange the wedding,' Mr Croft said. 

'My wife just decided we were going to go ahead with it at a time my prognosis was a bit uncertain. That gave me something to focus on.

'I was still recovering with my tiredness, but because of the day and all the excitement I managed to keep going.

'If anything, my family felt the worst of the incident more so than I did because I was out of it and unaware of what was going on.

'With head injuries, it's hard for doctors to give a clear prognosis until at least a week after the event, so there was a lot of uncertainty for them about whether I'd even be able to get married.'

He credits the actions of the air ambulance crew with saving his life. A doctor gave Mr Croft an anaesthetic as soon as he arrived at the scene at the Round House pub. It put Mr Croft into an induced coma

Inducing a coma takes the pressure off the brain and reduces the risk of brain damage. Mr Croft is pictured left, recovering in hospital with his father, and right with his wife Fiona

Mr Croft, pictured with his father and best man brother Darryl, said if it weren't for the air ambulance team he wouldn't have survived. He is supporting a campaign to help the London Air Ambulance fund a second helicopter to help more patients in the capital

Mr Croft said if it weren't for the London Air Ambulance, he wouldn't have made it down the aisle.

'I'm massively grateful for the fact they came and treated me,' he said.

'I'm pretty sure it had a significant impact on me being able to recover so quickly. They are so used to dealing with these sorts of injuries.

'I had to have four months off work as a result and I realised that life is quite fragile.

'It has made me more pro-active and made me want to live life while I can.' 

He is speaking out in support of the air ambulance's new campaign, launching next month to buy a second helicopter. 

He said guests at his wedding in Wymondham Abbey, Norfolk, laughed when they heard what he had been wearing when he was found by medics.

He added: 'My brother, Darryl, was my best man.

'He was able to explain to everybody what I was dressed as at the time.'
