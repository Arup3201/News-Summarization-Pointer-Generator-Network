Pioneering: Derya Sert, 22, from Anamur in Southern Turkey, was born without a womb

A woman who underwent the world’s first successful womb transplant is pregnant, it was revealed yesterday.

The success of Derya Sert’s IVF fertility treatment could give hope to thousands of childless British women.

Doctors treating the 22-year-old said early test results were ‘consistent with the expected signs of pregnancy’.

Mrs Sert was described as a ‘medical 
miracle’ when she became the first woman in the world to have a 
successful womb transplant, from a dead donor, in August 2011.

Since then other women have also been 
given a womb transplant, but Mrs Sert is the first to become pregnant.

Doctors in Antalya, Turkey, waited for 18 months before implanting an 
embryo into the transplanted womb, to give the pregnancy the greatest 
possible chance of survival.

However, Mrs Sert still faces a high 
risk of miscarriage and other complications in the early stages of 
pregnancy.

There is also a chance of birth defects linked to the 
immune-suppressing drugs used in transplants.

Mrs Sert was born without a womb, a 
rare condition which affects around one in 5,000 women.

But her ovaries 
were healthy and she produced eggs, which doctors harvested before the 
womb transplant to create embryos fertilised with sperm from her husband
Mustafa.

Earlier this month at least one 
fertilised embryo was placed into the new womb by specialists at Akdeniz
University Hospital in Antalya.

Any baby would be delivered via 
Caesarean section after eight months, to reduce the chance of premature 
labour.

Artificial selection: Mrs Sert had eight embryos
frozen before her treatment. Doctors thawed them before transferring 
them into her uterus - which she received in 2011 from a dead donor

Following a birth, doctors would then 
carry out further surgery to remove the donor womb, to avoid the risk of
infection or rejection.

A successful birth would give hope to 
the 15,000 women in Britain who are born without a womb or who have had 
hysterectomies.

A team of British doctors is hoping to perform the first
womb transplants in this country within two years.
