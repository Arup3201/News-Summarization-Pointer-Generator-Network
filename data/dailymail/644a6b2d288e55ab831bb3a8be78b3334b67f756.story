It’s always important to have a deep squad, and David Moyes will be delighted to have Danny Welbeck in his.

With Robin van Persie out, Wayne Rooney has taken on the bulk of responsibilities up front, but Welbeck is now playing an absolutely vital role.

He was a super sub at Norwich, scoring after coming on at half-time, and he now has four goals in his last four league games for United.

Under Sir Alex Ferguson, Welbeck was struggling to score.

Now Moyes has him doing that. Earlier this month he told Welbeck to follow Rooney’s example and stay behind after training to work on his finishing.

It’s amazing to hear a manager having to encourage his players to work harder; that should be par for the course.

I always looked at senior players and followed their work ethic but, in fairness, it seems to be working.

Since the start of December, Welbeck’s scored twice as many goals as he had during the rest of the season and his shooting accuracy has improved by 10 per cent.

Hull's pass master

Tom Huddlestone has been one of the signings of the season. The price of £5.25m was good business for Hull, good for Tottenham and good for Tom.

He’s playing football and he’s become a bit of a cult hero. He’s such a technical footballer, has two great feet and he strikes the ball so cleanly.

He hit a fierce shot with his left foot to score against Fulham and then smashed a 35-yard free-kick against the bar with his right.

He hit it just like Cristiano Ronaldo. I love that Steve Bruce has brought in good footballers and Hull aren’t afraid to attack. George Boyd and Robert Koren were both terrific on Saturday, and Huddlestone orchestrates it all, sitting deep in that quarterback position.

He really makes the team play and is 
one of the best passers in the league, he can put it on a sixpence from 
50 yards.

He’s formed a good midfield partnership with Jake Livermore in
 the middle, and it helps that they both know each other from their 
Spurs days.

There is a
 chance that Livermore could be recalled by Tim Sherwood, who is a fan, 
but Huddlestone is at Hull to stay, and what a great signing he has been
 for Steve Bruce.

Fourth is still no bad thing

I’d love to ask Brendan Rodgers if he would take fourth place now. I fancied my old side for a Champions League spot this season but never thought they would be title contenders.

They’re by no means out of it because this is a crazy season but in the last four seasons they have finished, on average, 27.5 points behind the title winners. To make up that difference in one season is a huge ask.

Down but not out: Luis Suarez was unable to find the back of the net against a resolute Chelsea side

They’ve not been close for a number of years so they’re not yet used to that winning consistency, but it will come. They have benefited from not being in Europe this season, but the Champions League needs Liverpool in it.

More than just a bench-warmer

Another striker that’s showing the value of a big squad is Edin Dzeko. He will see himself as a first-team player but with the form of Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo, his chances have been limited this season.

He’s a great player to have on the bench — he has scored 13 goals in 43 substitute appearances — but he will want more. He’s big, strong in the air and talented, and most teams would love to have him. Imagine the damage Chelsea would do if he was leading the line.

It shows City’s strength, and Dzeko will be important for them over the next few weeks with Aguero out injured.

Clinical: Dzeko's intelligent movement created a space for Jesus Navas to pick him out in the penalty area

Eden's magic

When he first arrived, I wondered whether Eden Hazard would be Jose Mourinho’s kind of player. He likes his wingers to work hard but I think he knows that, even if he doesn’t track back, Hazard is a match-winner.

They almost fell out when Hazard skipped training but Jose managed him well and you forget he’s still only 22.

Cardiff chaos

I thought I’d seen everything in football until Saturday night. The sight of Vincent Tan booing after the final whistle was utterly bizarre and it would be almost comical if it wasn’t such a desperate situation for the Cardiff fans.

It doesn’t matter if he was booing his own players or his own fans, it’s not the kind of behaviour you would expect from an owner, but then Vincent Tan is not your average owner. He has already changed the club’s colours from blue to red, helped fund Cardiff’s promotion to the Premier League and then sacked an incredibly popular manager in Malky Mackay.

Cardiff fans have waited more than 50 years to get back in the top flight, but so far their season has been engulfed in farce. Fans can put up with a lot of things if they feel the owner is committed and puts his money in, but their current situation is ridiculous.

They need to bring in a manager and are keen on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but will he want to work with Tan? There’s no doubt any manager would love to manage a club like Cardiff City, but with Tan in charge, they may not be quite so happy to take the risk.

Mutch to admire

Amid all the madness at Cardiff, there was one bright light for them on Saturday: Jordon Mutch. He’s only 22, but the midfielder is a fluid mover and good on the ball. He’s got an extra yard of pace that sets you apart and he has a fantastic attitude.

People might criticise some of Malky Mackay’s signings, but Mutch was a bargain at £2million from Birmingham and could develop into something special.
