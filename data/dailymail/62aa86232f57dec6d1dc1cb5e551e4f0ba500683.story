Struck off: Care-home nurse Martha Sekete placed an elderly patient's hands on a scalding hot radiator and dragged another across the floor on a bed sheet

A vicious care-home nurse who placed an elderly patient's hands on a scalding hot radiator and dragged another across the floor on a bed sheet has been kicked out of the profession.

Martha Sekete also snatched a sandwich from a male patient and threw it in the bin before shouting at him and grabbed a woman by her hair and neck to move her up the bed at Heath House in Birmingham.

Sekete, who was said to have shown 'no remorse' for her actions was found guilty of a series of charges relating to four residents at the Southern Cross-owned home during a single night shift of November 5 and 6, 2009.

After being placed on suspension Sekete visited the home of a fellow care assistant and asked her not to tell bosses what she had witnessed that night.

A conduct and competence committee found  found Sekete guilty of misconduct, and determined that her fitness to continue practising as a nurse was impaired.

Imposing a striking-off order, panel chair John Matharu said: 'The panel concluded that Ms Sekete's actions had put patients at unwarranted risk of harm, had brought the profession into disrepute, had breached fundamental tenets of the nursing profession and was dishonest.

'Ms Sekete has not demonstrated insight or remorse, or any recognition of the actual and potential consequences her actions could have had for service users.

'The panel is not aware of any steps she has taken to address and remedy those failings, or her underlying attitudinal problems.

'For these reasons, the panel concluded that there is a significant risk of Ms Sekete's actions being repeated in the future,' he added.

Cassandra Scarborough, for the NMC, told the hearing: 'The charges in question all relate to elderly service users, three females and one male, and happened during the course of that night in November 2009.'

The first incident was with service user A, who the registrant grabbed by her hair and neck while pulling her up in her bed.

She then dragged service user B on a bed sheet on the floor back to her bedroom, and she rested the hands of service user C on a radiator.

'She then snatched a sandwich from service user D, which her hands, threw it in the bin and said "you should not be taking other people's food".'

Sekete was also found to have failed to tell her former bosses about a police caution that she received for assault in November 2005.

She admitted going to see care assistant Sukhwinder Kaur after she was suspended, but denied telling her not to tell bosses what she had witnesses on the night of the shift in question.

But the panel found the evidence Ms Kaur to be more credible that Sekete's and found the fact proved.

Sekete has 28 days to challenge the striking off order and an 18 month interim suspension order has been imposed to cover any appeal period.
