West Bromwich Albion have made an offer to free agent Shola Ameobi as Tony Pulis looks to strengthen his striking options.

The former Newcastle centre forward is available for free after ending his contract with Turkish side Gaziantep.

Pulis is determined to find support for Saido Berahino, and Ameobi provides an abundance of Premier League experience.

No deal has yet been agreed, however, with Crystal Palace also monitoring the 33-year-old’s situation.

But Albion have presented 6ft 3in Ameobi with terms and are edging ahead. Pulis has space in his squad with Georgios Samaras set to join Al-Hilal on loan.

Buyers are also being sought for Brown Ideye, who has flopped dramatically since his club-record £10million move last summer. At this stage Albion want to sell the Nigerian rather than loan him out.

Ameobi, who scored 79 goals in 397 games on Tyneside, knows the top-flight well and would fit into the Pulis system. He scored four goals in 11 games for Gaziantep but the club suffered financial difficulties and Ameobi cut his spell short this month.
