David Hockney was in a ‘state of shock’ yesterday after the death of his 23-year-old studio assistant, who collapsed at the artist’s seaside home.

Dominic Elliott had been out with friends and was staying at the house overnight when he was taken ill and driven to hospital by Mr Hockney’s partner, John Fitzherbert.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out today and police are treating the death as ‘unexplained’.

It is not known whether Mr Hockney was
at the property in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, when Mr Elliott 
collapsed, but he is understood to be in the UK and not at his Los 
Angeles residence.

Yesterday his sister Margaret was seen coming and 
going from the house, but there was no sign of him or his partner.

Mr Hockney, who is worth around 
£37million, is likely to be interviewed by police along with Mr 
Elliott’s friends and colleagues.

A police spokesman said: ‘This is a 
sudden death and we will have to speak to people who worked or lived 
with the person who died, whether a world famous artist or a next door 
neighbour.’

Mr Elliott, who worked full-time for 
the artist and had even featured in a portrait painted by him, was a 
keen rugby player and described as ‘big, strong and fit’.

But his GP father died of a heart 
attack in 2001 aged only 42 and Mr Elliott had in the past complained of
chest pains. 

Doctors had warned him to curb his drinking over fears he
may have the same heart condition as his father, a friend said.

Police said there were no signs of 
violence at Mr Hockney’s house.

Mr Fitzherbert, who is in his early 60s,
is reported to have driven Mr Elliott 20 miles to Scarborough General 
Hospital.

He was said to have been  ‘vomiting’ 
and seriously ill  when he arrived at casualty at 6am on Sunday.

He died
shortly afterwards and hospital staff contacted Humberside Police.

Officers spent several hours at the house on Sunday morning and are 
understood to have spoken to Mr Hockney, 75, though he was not available
for comment yesterday.

A police spokesman said they were ‘undertaking 
enquiries to establish events leading to the death’.

Mr Elliott, who had known Mr Hockney 
since childhood, began working for him as a full-time general studio 
assistant about two years ago after quitting his university course.

Mr Hockney’s spokesman Erica Bolton 
said the artist was ‘incredibly upset’, adding: ‘He is, like everyone 
else, in a state of shock.’ She said Mr Elliott was ‘a very important 
person’ to Mr Hockney.

Mr Elliott lived in a shared flat in 
Bridlington and his solicitor mother Karen Kent lives in a bungalow on 
the outskirts of the town.

He had two sisters – Beth, 25, and Poppy, 21 –
and a 13-year-old brother, Max.

Bradford-born David Hockney's colourful paintings often showcase landscape of his native Yorkshire or his adopted home in California.

Hockney was an important 
contributor to the Pop Art movement of the 1960s and one of the most 
influential British artists of the 20th century.

He was the subject of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London last year with an exhibition of his large scale landscapes.

The artist is famous for artworks such as A Bigger Splash, a vivid depiction of a Los Angeles swimming pool, and the portrait Mr And Mrs Clark And Percy.

In recent years he has been exploring the possibilities of using an iPad for his artworks.

His print from 2008 of 'Dominic Elliott' (seen above) shows his ginger-haired assistant dressed in blue trousers and short sleeve top sat on a chair, staring straight ahead.

His grandmother Betty Kent, 84, from 
Boston, Lincolnshire, said Mr Elliott had been out with ‘arty types’ on 
Saturday night.

She said: ‘He’d been to his mother’s in the afternoon as
his washing machine was broken and he needed his clothes as he was 
going out with his mates.’

Mr Elliott’s grandfather Walter Elliott, 83, said: ‘I don’t know what happened. My suspicion is he had too much to drink.’

Mr Elliott was a trusted assistant who had keys to Mr Hockney’s house as much of the artist’s work was based from there.

‘He didn’t live with David but he was 
there a lot and often stayed over,’ said the grandfather. ‘I think David
very much looked on Dominic as a son.

‘I’ve been told Dominic was at a party
the night before he was taken ill. I don’t know whether the party was 
at David’s house or somewhere else.’

Mr Hockney is widely regarded as 
Britain’s greatest living artist.

His exhibition last year at  the Royal
Academy of Arts in London attracted more than 500,000 visitors.

Art gallery boss and painter Alan 
Stuttle, 74, who attended the Royal College of Art in London with Mr 
Hockney, said the tragedy will have hit the artist ‘like a 
sledgehammer’, adding: ‘He will learn to live with it. But he will never
get over it. He is such a caring man.’
