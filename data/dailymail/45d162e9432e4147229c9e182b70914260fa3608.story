For the past 160 days a South Carolina family have lived under self-quarantine, but not out of fears over the Ebola crisis - it's to protect their daughter who suffers from a rare syndrome.

Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara have opted to stay away from other people to protect Mr O'Neill's daughter Eliza, four, who has the rare metabolism disorder, Sanfilippo syndrome.

Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads.

Glenn and Cara O'Neill with their children, Eliza, four, and Beckham, seven, have been in self-quarantine for 160 days in order to protect Eliza who has a rear metabolic condition from getting any worse

In May Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Ms O'Neil left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Mr Neill now works from home as a purchasing consultant.

Mr O'Neill told the New York Daily News: 'People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?' 

The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They leave their house a week, but only to places they know will be empty, like a deserted beach. 

States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies mandating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines.

Medical experts have said the regulations are unnecessary and many people placed under the mandates have resisted them.

Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox was placed in a tent outside a New Jersey hospital with no shower, no TV and only a portable toilet after returning from Sierra Leone on Friday, The New York Post reported.

She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday. She was then allowed to return to her home in Maine where she served her 21-day quarantine. 

The only time Mr O'Neill has gone somewhere where there were other people, was a bank, to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation -  and it almost went horribly wrong. 

The 42-year-old informed the bank ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything. 

But after pulling on a protective mask and gloves while in the car park, a fellow motorist quickly retreated, 'he thought I was going to rob the place'.

Mr O'Neil then called the bank and reminded them of his circumstances before entering.

The family leaves the house once a week, but only to spots where they know other people won't be

Eliza, who is soon to turn five, is at a critical stage. A simple cold or illness could accelerate her deterioration, and keeping her away from people has paid off.

Mr O'Neill said she has not gotten sick and is doing as well as can be expected. 

The family is raising money to fund a clinical trial that will hopefully cure the disease. 

They will remain under quarantine under the procedure is available, which the hope is early next year.

Ms O'Neill said her and her husband appreciate the time they spend with their children, but conceded living under the conditions wasn't easy.  The family don't have a TV and spend a limited amount of time using computers.

She said: 'We're OK. We do what we can do. Sometimes we get overwhelmed, but it's just life. We have bad moments and good ones.'

The family doesn't get visitors, but they will Skype their relatives and Eliza's speech therapist.
