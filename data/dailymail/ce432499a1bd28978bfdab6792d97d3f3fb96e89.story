Thousands of bare-breasted young Swazi women paraded themselves in front of their king yesterday in a lavish ceremony to celebrate chastity and unity.

Dressed in beaded skirts, clutching machetes and mobile phones, women and girls danced and sang tributes to the king and queen mother - also known as the Great She-Elephant - in a traditional Umhlanga Reed Dance to celebrate womanhood and virginity.

Those taking part dismissed criticism of the extravagant celebrations on Sunday and Monday, which took place in one of Africa's poorest countries, ruled by the continent's last absolute monarch.

Celebrations: Thousand of virgins took part in the event in honour of a royal family which has in some quarters been criticised for being out of touch with a country where many live in abject poverty

National pride: Many of the women taking part stressed their dedication to their king and their chastity

'I'm proud to be Swazi and to be a virgin. We are here to show unity with the king and with each other,' said 18-year-old Gcebine Dlamini.

She braced herself against the cold of the southern hemisphere's winter in her skimpy outfit as scores of tourists had photos taken next to the topless women.

King Mswati III, who has at least a dozen wives and a personal fortune estimated at $200million, faced unprecedented protests last year when his appointed administration ran out of money after a 2009 recession in neighbouring South Africa.

Despite the touch economic climate, the royal household has shown few signs of wanting to tighten its belt.

Tradition: The maidens bring reeds cut from river beds, which they then presented to the queen mother in a mile-long singing and foot-stamping procession

Showing off the goods: In the past, the king has used the ceremony to choose a new wife, and some girls still hoped to catch the king's eye

In July, South Africa's Mail and 
Guardian newspaper reported that three of Mswati's wives joined a 
66-strong royal entourage heading to Las Vegas on a shopping spree.

There was no comment from the palace.

But women at the annual event gathered 
behind the monarch in the week-long celebrations, even though police 
kept a close watch on what they might tell journalists and tourists 
roaming the grounds of the royal village, some 20km (12 miles) outside 
the capital.

In the past, the king has used the ceremony to choose a new wife, and some girls still hoped to catch the king's eye.

'If chosen, I would be able to live a better life than what I have, have a lot of money, live a queen's life and travel overseas,' said Fakazile Dlamini, 14, who arrived on a lorry from her village 60km away to attend the ceremony.

New royal wives have often received a BMW and their own palace, fuelling criticism in a country where more than two-thirds of its 1.4million people live in abject poverty.

Women's groups and political opponents also say Mswati's penchant for multiple young brides is out of touch in a country with the world's highest rate of HIV/AIDS.

The monarch says polygamy is part of Swazi tradition and helps cement national unity.

Despite growing discontent, maidens 
still flock in from across the country - some attend the ceremony every 
year until they marry.

They 
bring reeds cut from river beds, which they then presented to the queen 
mother in a mile-long singing and foot-stamping procession.

In the past, they would have been accommodated by families living close to the royal household. These days they are put up in camps and protected by police from other men.

Even though the girls refuse to criticise UK-educated Mswati, who arrived at the event dressed in beads and lion cloth, not everyone supported his polygamous lifestyle.

'I don't want to be a queen, I don't want to share my man. Polygamy is not okay,' said Siphesihle Mdluli, 20, while waving her bundle of reeds.Â
