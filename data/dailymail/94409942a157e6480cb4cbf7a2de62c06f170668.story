CEO of Private Islands Inc. who market the list of 700 islands for sale and rent all over the world, Chris Krolow told MailOnline Travel: 'Our typical client is one who is looking for a project, and looking to put their own mark on an island.

'It is very rare to get people who say the islands is perfect as it is; they may want to redesign the buildings, repair the boathouse, make extra developments to make it their own.

'Our clients are not there to lay back and relax and enjoy it as it comes, they are there to work at it.'

Mr Krolow, who founded the company 16 years ago, and who also runs Private Islands Magazine as well as hosts/produces Island Hunters for HGTV in the US added: 'Selling or buying an island is very different to doing the same with any property, the only thing the same is the paperwork.

'Most of our clients know what they want, say they've been boating around the Bahamas and they realise that they want that island they kept passing.

'But we would always say you can try before you buy; it is a unique lifestyle and not everybody is cut out for it. There are islands available to rent and it gives you a chance to work out all the logistics like travel, time spent there.'

The most expensive island on our list is Venice Island, located in the lagoon of Venice itself. It's on the market for a cool £9.6 million ($15 million).

Only a short boat ride to Venice where you can enjoy luxury shopping and eating, the island boasts four buildings including an exquisite villa.

'For the right person, Venice Island is an absolute steal,' added Mr Krolow.

'It's a great opportunity as it's so close to Venice, and the fact that it already has existing structure is a huge factor as regulations in Italy are strict with this.'
