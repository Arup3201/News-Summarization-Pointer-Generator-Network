Rangers full-back Lee Wallace admitted last week that his Scotland career effectively ended when he elected to remain at Ibrox following the club’s descent into administration, liquidation and the Third Division.

Before being signed from Hearts by then manager Ally McCoist for £1.5million in the summer of 2011, he had made five appearances for his country. However, his residency in the lower leagues has seen the 27-year-old make just three substitute appearances (totalling a mere 53 minutes) for the national team in the last four years.

Wallace claimed that, as he approaches what should be his peak years as a player, he has all but abandoned hope of forcing his way into Gordon Strachan’s starting 11.

Ibrox team-mate Cammy Bell could be forgiven for adopting a similar approach. The goalkeeper’s only cap came against the Faroe Islands in 2010, when he was playing for Kilmarnock. His involvement with Scotland squads, a regular occurrence during his time at Rugby Park, ended when he joined Rangers in 2013.

However, the 28-year-old, whose international prospects were further hindered by a shoulder injury sustained in August which ruled him out of action for seven months, is in no mood to close the door on his chances of representing his country just yet.

There’s also the small matter of David Marshall, Craig Gordon and Allan McGregor being ahead of him in the pecking order.

But Bell insisted: ‘I would never say it’s over. I’m desperate to play and be part of the squad. The goalkeeping situation is very strong and there are some great goalies there. I totally respect that.

‘All I can do is keep playing well at club level and keep knocking on the door and, hopefully, the manager will take notice.’

Of course, as a goalkeeper, Bell can afford to be more sanguine than outfield players. All things being equal, he should still be playing at a high level for another decade or so.

That, however, does not mean he isn’t impatient for success. Some former Rangers players, including Barry Ferguson, the 2003 Treble-winning captain, have claimed that another season in the Championship may prove beneficial for the Ibrox club while the first-team squad is dismantled and rebuilt from scratch.

Lee Wallace's Scotland career is effectively over

Bell doesn’t see it that way and he wants last Sunday’s unexpected victory over play-off rivals Hibs to be the starting point on the road to Rangers returning to the top flight this year.

‘I can only speak for myself, and I want to be playing in the top league,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to be ambitious as a player and I want to play at the highest level I can with Rangers.

‘I’m desperate to be back in the top league and I’m sure everyone else associated with the club is as well. We know it’s going to be hard but there’s still a great chance we can do it.

‘We need to be playing well going into the play-offs so it really starts from now. We have to take some good form into them. We have nine games left in the league and we have to show we can do it on the pitch.’

New owner Dave King would also appreciate promotion being achieved sooner rather than later. With shareholder Mile Ashley seemingly having a stranglehold on the bulk of the profits arising from the club’s retail operation, the financially-challenged club need a fresh injection of cash.

In the last few days the Three Bears consortium of Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor have donated £1.5million in order to pay this month’s wages but season-ticket renewal money in May, ideally at increased Premiership rates, is likely to be vital.

Bell was speaking yesterday to publicise a new four-match ticket package for this season’s remaining home games but the improved performance against Hibs will have done as much to increase attendances at Ibrox for those fixtures.

As far as the goalkeeper is concerned, however, there is more to come from Stuart McCall’s side between now and the end of May.

‘Yes, we’ve set a high bar but, at the end of the day, we are playing for Rangers Football Club so the bar should be set high,’ he said.

‘We can handle that: we should be able to handle the pressure and I’m sure we will. That performance has been in us all season and it was just a case of trying to bring it out of us.

‘I’m sure we’ll take confidence from it and we’ll work hard on the training pitch to make sure we are ready for games.’

Bell credited McCall for the transformation in the atmosphere at Ibrox. The former Motherwell manager has dispelled the gloom which surrounded the club during the dog days of McCoist and Kenny McDowall.

‘I think it’s just down to the enthusiasm the new manager has brought,’ he said. ‘He’s brought a spark to training too.

‘He was always a passionate player himself and he soon lets us know if we are doing things right in training. He’s been great and he’s brought a new lease of life to some players.

‘It’s a good start for us but we know there will be tough times ahead so we need to just take each game as it comes and concentrate on getting three points in the next game.’
