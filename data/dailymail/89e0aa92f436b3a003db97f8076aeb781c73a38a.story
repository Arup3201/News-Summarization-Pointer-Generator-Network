Online retailers are seeing their fastest growth in sales in 13 years, confirming Britain as the internet shopping capital of the world.

Web sales rose by 13 per cent last month compared with August, and were 20 per cent higher than in September last year, said the e-Retail Sales Index compiled by industry experts IMRG and Capgemini.

Clothing, particularly lingerie, saw strong increases following the success of sites such as ASOS, which has grown into a global brand.

There has been a 150 per cent increase in shopping via smartphones, such as the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, compared to a year ago.

Shopping over the internet has also been boosted by the fact more companies, such as ASOS and Dixons, offer same-day delivery.

The September figure was the fastest increase for the month in the 13 years that the e-Retail Sales Index has been running.

The same index suggested total sales in September were some 20 per cent higher than the same month last year.

While high street bricks and mortar stores are seeing a fall in sales of fashions and shoes, this is being more than made up by increases over the web.

More than 10 per cent of all retail sales are now made over the internet in the UK, with this proportion predicted to more than double by 2020.

Web shopping in Britain is particularly strong because the nation is doing a significant amount of its weekly food purchases  online, alongside all the other products, from clothes and books to TVs and other gadgets.

Some 21 per cent of families here shop online for food and groceries, compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe and the rest of the world.

A new EU study shows 82 per cent of British internet users regularly shop online, which is the highest of the 28 member states.

Denmark and Sweden come in second at 79per cent, with Germany on 77 per cent, Luxembourg on 73 per cent and Finland at 72 per cent.

At the other end of the scale are Italy and Estonia, at just 29 per cent, and Romania at just 11 per cent.

The research showed that internet users in the UK lead for online purchases of clothes and food, while Sweden is number one on travel and Luxembourg for books.

Internet shopping is also stronger in the UK than the US, because web purchases of food and groceries has not taken off there to the same extent.

Last week, Marks & Spencer launched a new online butcher and fishmonger, while the Morrisons chain will start selling food over the web with home deliveries in partnership with Ocado in January.

IMRG said web sales of clothing were up by 18 per cent to this time last year, with lingerie up 30per cent, accessories by 20 per cent and footwear by 20 per cent.

Tina Spooner of IMRG, said: ‘The latest Index results are encouraging as we enter the fourth quarter, with retailers preparing for the crucial festive trading period.

‘The record monthly growth in September is an indication of increasing consumer confidence and with smartphone year-on-year sales growth reaching an impressive 150 per cent, it is also evident that shoppers are becoming more comfortable with shopping via their mobile devices.’

Chris Webster, the head of retail consulting at Capgemini, said: ‘This month’s Index is a good indicator that we are headed towards economic recovery, and a great sign for a strong Christmas.

‘The fact that e-retail has seen its sharpest period of growth for September suggests that consumers are shopping with confidence.’
