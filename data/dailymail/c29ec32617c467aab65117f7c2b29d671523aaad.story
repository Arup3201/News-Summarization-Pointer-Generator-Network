Police officers have to do some of the hardest work in the community, and are often tasked with less than ideal scenarios to deal with.

Bringing the fun back into the job, however, are officers with the Reykjavik police department, who are raking in followers via social media for their hilarious photos from the line of duty.

It is not surprising that Iceland's capital has one of the lowest crime rates in the world - with the fun photographs showing officers finding the time to dress as Star Wars characters, play with kittens and feed wild geese.

The police department has been winning over followers by the thousands with cute snaps like this one 

From reading stories to children to doing handstands in the snow, the police department's Instagram account reveals a human side to its officers for its 133,000 followers.

It has long been debated why the crime rate is so low in Iceland with data from the UN in 2011 showing the homicide rate between 1999-2009 never climbed above 1.8 homicides per 100,000 residents on any given year.

This is compared to the US where rates were between 5.0 and 5.8 homicides per 100,000 people.

In 2013, a man who shot at police became the first person to be killed by an officer in Iceland’s history.

Police said at the time that they apologised to the man’s family after the shooting, saying they had tried to subdue him peacefully.

They said he fired at officers with a shotgun from inside his flat in the capital, hitting one police officer on their helmet.
