England footballer Adam Lallana has been given permission for a controversial all-weather football pitch in his back garden, but has been told he cannot put up floodlights.

The Liverpool midfielder outraged neighbours earlier this year after building a £40,000 pitch in his back garden without planning permission.

But it seems the dispute is now over after back-dated consent was granted by East Dorset District Council for the play area which he intends to use for kickabouts with his two-year-old son, Arthur.

Mr Lallana upset some of his neighbours in the village of Ringwood, on the border of Hampshire and Dorset, in June when he built the games area, which included a pitch, basketball nets and zip wire, in the garden of his £1.5million five-bed home

Mr Lallana upset some of his neighbours in the village of Ringwood, on the border of Hampshire and Dorset, in June when he built the games area, which included a pitch, basketball nets and zip wire, in the garden of his £1.5million five-bed home.  

The council ruled that the England international needed permission for supports for the zip wire tower and basketball hoops because of their height.

Mr Lallana then retrospectively applied for permission and it has now been granted.

But planning officer Neil Lancaster warned: 'One of the concerns which could change the character of the area would be the installation of floodlights, so we are suggesting that there should be a condition against it.' 

The council planning committee was told this week that since the original complaints, a large amount of landscaping and planting had been carried out.

Councillors heard that the fencing round the pitch was now largely screened by a two-metre holly hedge, the boundary with the immediate neighbouring property now had four-metre red cedar trees, and further landscaping was planned.

Neighbour Brian Riley said the development had a significant effect on the health and quality of life of him and his wife Constance, since it could be clearly seen from their house.

He said in June: 'We didn’t object to this application, why would we? We understand kids need somewhere to play.

'But then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we couldn’t work out what was going on. We saw this sports pitch being built and we just couldn’t believe it.

'The council enforcement officer told us it was more in-keeping with a council play park than a garden in a special character area, which this area is.'  

But Peter Roberts, whose home is 150ft away, said he backed Mr Lallana.

'There is already very little view of the structures from any angle, and within the next 12 months the Lallanas will have a beautiful garden and imaginative play area for their family,' he said.  

Mike Hirsh, a planning consultant acting for Mr Lallana, said: 'He needed [planning permission] for two sections of fencing, which he was granted.

'There is still a little landscaping to do but the work is done now.'
