Fresh from the most eye-popping Ryder Cup debut since Sergio Garcia got up US noses in 1999, American Patrick Reed is back to add a welcome dollop of spice to the Volvo World Match Play Championship, which begins at the London Golf Club in Kent on Wednesday.

At Gleneagles, Reed took on the home crowd with his histrionic fist pumping and exhortations of joy every time he holed a birdie putt. When he got back to America, he was overwhelmed with congratulatory emails.

Not surprising given he registered a team-high 3.5 points, but what did take him aback was that most of them came from Europe.

‘About five were from Americans and the rest were from the European crowd,’ said the 24-year-old.

‘All of them were positive. It’s the one week where you can go back and forth with the crowds. They clearly loved the fact I gave them something to react to.

‘Am I going to get as rowdy this week? Probably not. But if I am making birdies and playing well, there will be fist pumps and excitement.’

Graeme McDowell, defending champion this week, acknowledged the X factor Reed delivers.

‘All credit to him for coming over because he definitely adds a dynamic,’ he said. ‘He is controversial in a good way, in an Ian Poulter-like way.’

Reed has been following the inquest into America’s crushing Ryder Cup defeat. He made it clear he didn’t agree with Phil Mickelson’s analysis that it was all captain Tom Watson’s fault.

‘He was my first captain and I actually enjoyed what he did,’ said Reed. ‘Honestly, for me, if we win or lose it’s not really on what is said or anything like that.

‘I felt like our camaraderie was great. It comes down to us and how we play and unfortunately we didn’t play well enough.’

With astute analysis like that, what a shame Reed isn’t part of the task force appointed by the PGA of America on Tuesday to look into why they keep losing.

Instead, the four players who have lost the most matches in American Ryder Cup history —Jim Furyk (20), Mickelson (19), Tiger Woods (17), and Raymond Floyd (16) — are all part of the task force, while Paul Azinger, the only winning American Ryder Cup captain this century, is not. It’s beyond parody, isn’t it?

As for Reed, he will have to show some of that Gleneagles form if he is to get through a group including doughty Swede Jonas Blixt, in-form Englishman Paul Casey and another whose profile shot skywards following a sterling Ryder Cup debut, Welshman Jamie Donaldson.

The quartet will play each other over the next three days with the top two progressing to the quarter-finals on Saturday.

McDowell will kick off on Wednesday against Frenchman Alexander Levy, who won the rain-curtailed Portugal Masters last week. Joost Luiten and Mikko Ilonen complete this group.

Scot Stephen Gallacher will take on Irishman Shane Lowry in a good-looking match in a group that also features Victor Dubuisson and Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal.

Henrik Stenson is the standout name in the fourth group which also includes Francesco Molinari, George Coetzee and Thongchai Jaidee.

The 16-man field is divided into four groups, with two from each group progressing into Saturday’s quarter-finals after playing one another over the next three days.

The semi-finals and final will be held on Sunday.
