Rudy Giuliani turned an MSNBC segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson into a soapbox for his thoughts on black-on-black crime.

The former mayor appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday to address a debate about disproportionately white police forces in predominately black cities like Ferguson.

Giuliani must believe there is value in making police forces representative of the population, stating it was a goal not only of his administration but of all New York mayors since Ed Koch.

Sound off: Rudy Giuliani appeared on Meet the Press and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson to say white cops wouldn't be needed 'if you weren't killing each other'

'We've tried to make the police force of New York City as proportionate as we possibly can. We go out of our way to do that. I think we do a pretty good job, not a perfect job.' 

He quickly diverted from that subject, arguing with MSNBC contributor and Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson about black crime.

'I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,' said Giuliani. 

Giuliani did not mention the source used, though a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found in reported crimes from 2005, 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black.

The study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person.

Dyson pushed back against Giuliani, calling the link made by the mayor a 'false equivalency.'

'First of all, most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail,' Dyson said. 

Back and forth: On a segment about racially proportionate police, Giuliani first stated he worked to keep a balanced force, then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods

'Number two, they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law,' he added.

Giuliani took off his glasses and cut in to argue  for more police in black neighborhoods as Dyson questioned officers' ability to effectively police those communities.

'The police presence cannot make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals,' he stated.

The segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while Anthony Gray, attorney for Michael Brown's family, sat silent, before Giuliani capped his rant.

'Why don’t you cut it down so so many white police officers don’t have to be in black areas?' Giuliani shouted. 'The white police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.'
