New laws designed to control invasive species such as grey squirrels and Japanese knotweed could end up harming British wildlife, experts have warned.

The Government has proposed a series of laws which could compel landowners to take action to stop the spread of non-native species.

But experts led by the Zoological Society of London have warned the new rules, which are proposed to be included in the Infrastucture Bill, are so badly written that they could hit projects to reintroduce extinct or struggling species such as beavers, cranes, rare bumblebees and uncommon butterflies.

The new rules are intended to stop the spread of invasive species such as this grey squirrel 

In open letter published last night in the journal Nature, 24 scientists warned that the laws could lead to an ‘irreversible loss’ of wildlife.

The Infrastructure Bill defines non-native species as those that are ‘not ordinarily resident in, or a regular visitor to, Great Britain’.

The experts warned that the definition covered species that had been native to Britain but had become extinct and wildlife that could go on to naturally establish itself in this country.

Bizarrely, the Bill would also limit conservation actions for species such as barn owls and red kites, which are listed in a 30-year-old document drawn up prevent breeding of certain species without a licence – which conservationists was created for a completely different purpose.

The experts’ letter said: ‘The current definition has serious implications for wildlife management.

‘Once a species is classified as non-native, it can also be classified as invasive - and would therefore be subject to invasive-species legislation.

‘If the Bill is passed in its present form, it could lead to an irreversible loss of native biodiversity.’

Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the RSPB, said last night: ‘The Government is absolutely right that non-native species pose an extreme threat to our economy and wildlife.

‘But as it’s currently drafted the Infrastructure Bill wrongly defines some species such as the red kite or barn owl as non-native. This is surely not the Government’s intention.

‘There have been many great projects involving species which have been lost from the UK, such as the short-haired bumble-bee, crane, large blue butterfly and white-tailed eagle - it would be perverse to define any of these species as non-native.

‘The current drafting could stand in the way of reintroduction projects involving these species and, in extreme cases, even some native could be removed. We trust the Bill will be more tightly drafted to allow genuinely native species to thrive.

Grahame Madge of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, pictured, said the new legislation as drafted could threaten the future of species such as red kite and barn own which are deemed to be non-native 

Butterfly Conservation chief executive Dr Martin Warren said: ‘Legislation on non-natives needs to be carefully drafted so that it does not impact on the conservation of species across their former and future geographic ranges.’

He said many species of butterflies and moths were arriving naturally from continental Europe in response to climate change and should be welcomed as additions to British wildlife.

‘Most of them are benign and will be losing their range further south so this shift will allow them to maintain their distribution range.

‘A very small number of species may become pests but these will have to be judged on their own merits.

‘In contrast, the introduction of non-native species from outside of Europe are likely to pose much bigger risks and should be the focus of attention.’

Officials, however, insisted the new laws would not be used when it was illogical to do so.

A government spokesman said: ‘We want to use these control orders as a last resort to protect our wildlife and economy from invasive non-native species. They will not be used for species that are the subject of a legitimate reintroduction programme.’
