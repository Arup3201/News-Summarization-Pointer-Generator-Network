The sister of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf, who is fighting in Syria with Islamic State forces, has condemned her brother's actions as 'abhorrent'. 

This week Sharrouf's older sister Damour Sharrouf and her husband Ahmed Alwash are again under scrutiny over their business Bisotel Rieh, located in Lakemba in Sydney's west.

The  Fairfax Media reported that proceedings have commenced against the remittance firm, after it was suspended late last month amid accusations it was funneling money overseas to fund terrorism in the Middle East.

The nation's financial intelligence unit, Austrac, announced the suspension following information that as much as $20 million had been sent to Turkey and Lebanon.

On Thursday Bisotel Rieh released a statement confirming the Austrac investigations and the links to Sharrouf, who made headlines when he posted a shocking picture of his young son brandishing a severed head earlier this year.

'Bisotel acknowledges that Ms Sharrouf's brother, Khaled Sharrouf, is a member of a proscribed terrorist organisation and has in recent months engaged in shocking behaviour that is repugnant to Australian law and values, and that Ms Sharrouf herself finds abhorrent,' the statement read in part, according to Fairfax.

It also revealed: issues within the company had been identified by Austrac in relation to: 'existing systems, practices and procedures for managing the risk that it may, inadvertently or not, facilitate terrorism funding'.

Bisotel Rieh, which means magic carpet, also said their registration had not been cancelled and denied there were any allegations that the company, Ms Sharrouf or Mr Alwash financed any terrorism operations nor provided any money to Khaled Sharrouf.

Sharrouf is one of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for Islamist groups in the Middle East, and drew international condemnation after he posted a revolting image of his son brandishing a decapitated head on social media in August.

He fled to Syria via Malaysia using his brother's passport. 

The picture was captioned: 'that's my boy!'

While about 60 Australians are fighting in Iraq and Syria with groups such as Islamic State, another 100 are believed to be providing support from Australia.

Earlier this month the sister of another Australian terrorist, Mohamed Elomar, was stopped at Sydney airport trying to board a flight to Dubai with her two children.

The woman, who was not named, was questioned before she was released, but was not allowed to leave Australia.
