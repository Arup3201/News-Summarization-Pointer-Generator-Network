Having tipped Brazil to win the World Cup I must say their opening performance against Croatia was an anti-climax that highlighted vulnerabilities, particularly in defence.

The brightest thing about Thursday evening from the hosts’ point of view was the extraordinary home support, as I saw close up.

To watch the match I made a three-hour journey through some of the worst traffic I’ve ever seen into the mountains above Rio de Janeiro, to share the occasion with two former Manchester United team-mates, Da Silva twins Rafa and Fabio.

They had a big crowd of family and friends around to watch the game, 25 people in one room, including six kids. When the first note of the national anthem played, every single person stood up, held on to each other with something approaching fervour, and then absolutely belted out the anthem, every word of it as if their lives depended on it.

Never mind the hairs on the back of my neck, I had a chill down the spine being part of that. It was the most extraordinary demonstration of what the World Cup means to these Brazilians.

The game is in their DNA and not just those among them who are footballers. Then the game started and everyone watched in silence, nervous as it remained scoreless through the first 10 minutes and then shocked as Croatia took the lead.

At that point Rafa said to me, quite dryly: ‘If it stays like this, you won’t be going back down to Rio tonight. It’ll be mayhem down there if we lose.’

The room was quiet, despondent, but it didn’t stay like that as Neymar equalised and then Brazil went on to win. They were lucky, frankly. The penalty for 2-1 was an absolute joke.

There was no way whatsoever that should have been a penalty. The most generous interpretation was that it was a dubious decision. The ref was conned, in my view. I hope for the sake of the  tournament that it wasn’t an early sign that poor officiating could spoil things.

Croatia started well and deserved to be ahead. The Brazil back four were visibly  uncomfortable with the ball being crossed into the area. Against better teams and better strikers I fear they are going to have  problems.

As attacking full backs, Dani Alves and Marcelo are right up there among the best in the world, but as pure defenders, let’s just say they’re not at the same level. As for the rest of Brazil’s team, I don’t get what Paulinho’s purpose is in there.

What's his purpose? Paulinho (right) isn't a ball winner or a creator and it isn't clear what he brings to Brazil

He’s not a ball-winner who breaks up play. He isn’t a creator. I’d have Ramires in way ahead of him. Luiz Gustavo and Oscar were the best performers for me.

Neymar was relatively quiet by his own standards, even if he scored twice. That’s the mark of a really great player, doing not much then contributing  something significant when it matters.

After the final whistle we went outside to play foot-volleyball on the twins’ full-size beach  volleyball court. Rafa and I were beaten by Fabio and a mate of theirs, who plays for Vasco da Gama.

I got back to Rio late, and there were still umpteen impromptu matches being played all along the beach. There are people everywhere in football shirts — Brazil, Colombia and Chile especially.

But those people aside, it’s odd. There’s no other sign a World Cup is unfolding around us. No billboards. No  posters. No VIP traffic lanes.

Just people, in love with football.
