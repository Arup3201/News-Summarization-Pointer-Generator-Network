The makers of Candy Crush Saga have seen nearly $1 billion wiped off the company's value after its first day of trading on the stock market.

King's initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $22.50 on Tuesday, valuing the company at $7.1 billion. But it opened on Wednesday at $20.50, down almost 9 per cent and had lost more ground by mid-morning.

King's shares fell to a low of $19.08 at one stage on Wednesday morning, valuing the company at about $6 billion.

King Digital Entertainment PLC, based in 
Ireland, had $1.88 billion in revenue last year - more than ten times 
its 2012 revenue of $164.4 million.

The company’s games also include Pet Rescue Saga and Farm Heroes Saga, but analysts have questioned whether King would be able to repeat the success of Candy Crush.

But Riccardo Zacconi, King's co-founder and chief executive, told CNBC this morning that the company is ‘not just a one-hit wonder’ and pointed out that it has three games in the top ten on Facebook.

King is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‘KING’.

By mid-morning, the stock was down $2.50, or 11 per cent, at $20 per share.

‘With King Digital, there is a lot of concern about its ability to keep coming up with popular games,’ said Jay Ritter, a professor and IPO expert at the University of Florida.

‘The offer price was set at the middle of the filed price range, indicating that there was neither exceptionally strong nor exceptionally weak demand,’ Mr Ritter said.

The two-year-old Candy Crush game, in which users move candies to line up at least three in the same color, has a seemingly endless supply of new levels and features to keep its nearly 100 million users occupied every day.

Its success has spawned reports of Candy Crush addiction with a Facebook page dedicated to addicts of the game, in which users get daily bonuses and new levels every few weeks.

The free game has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch on mobile devices.

Using the ‘freemium’ model, King makes money by selling players extra lives, lucky candy and other add-ons.

King sold 15.5 million shares of the 22.2 million offered, with the rest coming from stakeholders including private equity firm Apax Partners, which remains the biggest shareholder. London-based King raised about $500 million in its IPO.

While analysts have questioned whether the success of Candy Crush Saga can be repeated, King's chief executive has insisted the game is more than just a 'one-hit wonder'

In February, King said an average 144 million daily active users played its games more than 1.4 billion times per day.

King's IPO is the largest by a mobile gaming company since Zynga Inc went public in 2011, valuing the maker of ‘Farmville’ at $7 billion.

Zynga's market value has since shrunk to just over $4 billion, another victim of concerns about the danger of investing in companies that rely heavily on a hit game. Its shares fell 4 per cent.

While King also offers about other 180 games, about three-quarters of its revenue comes from ‘Candy Crush’.

‘We're building on traffic from Candy Crush,' Mr Zacconi said in an interview on CNBC, adding that the users attracted by the game will play its other games.

Riccardo rejected suggestions that his company faced the same issues as Zynga, which was heavily dependent on Facebook.

‘I think we're different because we cracked mobile, not only reach, but monetisation, which allows us to buy marketing and be in control of the steering wheel ... we are not reliant on someone featuring us,’ he said.
