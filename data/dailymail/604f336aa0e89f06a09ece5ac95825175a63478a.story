George Osborne is under intense pressure to attend the Leveson inquiry after it emerged he entertained Rebekah Brooks at his country estate

George Osborne is facing growing pressure to appear before the Leveson inquiry after further details emerged of his close links to the Murdoch press.

The Chancellor entertained former News International boss Rebekah Brooks at his grace and favour residence in Buckinghamshire while Rupert Murdoch was planning to take over BSkyB.

The gathering was also attended by former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who at the time was David Cameron’s director of communications.

It happened while the Government was deciding whether to accept Murdoch’s £8billion bid for the whole of BSkyB.

Labour said the fact that the event, at his Dorneywood residence, took place at all raised fundamental questions about Mr Osborne’s judgment.

The news will also increase pressure on Mr Osborne to appear in person at the Leveson inquiry to answer questions about his links to the Murdoch team.

He has so far only been asked to give written evidence but aides say he would be happy to appear if asked.

Details of the gathering at 
Dorneywood are contained in a written statement to the inquiry submitted
by Mr Coulson, who appeared before it on Thursday.

The Chancellor has already made public four meetings with Mrs Brooks during 2010.

A spokesman said he believed the Dorneywood meeting had been declared by Mr Osborne as having taken place in September 2010.

It was listed by the Chancellor as a merely ‘social’ event, and the location was not specified.

Aides said no discussions of the BSkyB bid took place.

Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy 
leader, said: ‘When senior members of a government are looking at a bid 
such as the BSkyB one they have not only to make sure they act 
impartially but that they are seen to be acting impartially.’
