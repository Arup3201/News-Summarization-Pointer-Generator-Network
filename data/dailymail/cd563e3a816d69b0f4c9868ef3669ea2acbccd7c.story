Texas Governor Rick Perry made quite the entrance before delivering his speech at the National Rifle Association convention this weekend, showing off his impressive shooting skills.

The NRA is holding its annual convention in  the Governor's home state, with more than 70,000 people attending to hear speeches and demos of guns and ammo.

Perry's shown here using a military style rifle and being so accurate in his sharp-shooting as to explode an egg from 100 yards during target practice.

Don't mess with the Governor: Rick Perry strikes a pose after blasting an egg to smithereens in an introductory video for the NRA conference

The short video played just before Perry took the stage to a rapturous welcome from the crowd and showed him gunning down target after target.

The film ends in slow motion with him removing the magazine and giving a hero-like gaze.

Perry uses a LaRue Tactical rifle, which recently opened up shop in Texas.

The video goes on to show the marksman-like Perry aiming at metal objects.

Now you see it...

Now you don't!

We're out of eggs.

How was that? The Governor looks off-camera for reassurance at his performance

Rick Perry's office said he was shooting a LaRue PredatOBR 7.62.

Online the film got a mixed reaction with some saying they loved him and that it qualified him to be President, whilst others said it did nothing but 'promote and excite the already gun-thirsty and violent society'.

Perry is an avid gun rights supporter and shooter and as Governor has attempted to draw more firearms manufacturers to Texas.

Rick Perry: Rick Perry speaks during the leadership forum at the National Rifle Association's annual where he told the audience that President Obama wants to ¿disarm the American public¿

During his speech to the convention he said that passing new gun control laws won’t stop criminals and would only make law-abiding citizens easy targets by depriving them of weapons to defend themselves.

Perry said issues such as tighter background checks on guns sales would only hurt non-criminals who want to buy them. Perry says there are 'no easy fixes' to gun violence, but that limiting gun ownership is not the answer.

In January, Perry lashed out at President Barack Obama’s plan on the heels of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to curb gun violence, saying that the Second Amendment trumps Barack Obama or any other president.
