Alan Pardew remains in the market for attacking personnel but he may have unearthed a gem from the club's academy after teenager Rolando Aarons tortured Schalke in a 3-1 victory at the Veltins Arena.

The 18-year-old Jamaican – who also qualifies for England – laid on one goal for Emmanuel Riviere and scored another as the Magpies enjoyed an unlikely win over their Champions League hosts.

Aarons – who was born in Kingston - is a product of the youth system on Tyneside having signed from Bristol City in 2012. He's yet to make his competitive debut but is sure to now figure in Pardew's first-team plans after an impressive pre-season.

VIDEO Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew  

Schalke (4-3-3): Ralf Fahrmann; Kaan Ayhan (Marvin Friedrich 46), Felipe Santana, Joel Matip, Sead Kolasinac (Christian Fuchs 46); Roman Neustadter (Marco Hoger 46), Marcel Sobottka, Dennis Aogo (Axel Borgmann 71); Kevin Prince Boateng (c) (Maurice Multhaup 46), Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (Donis Avdijaj 62), Max Meyer (Pascal Itter 71) Newcastle United (4-4-2): Tim Krul (Rob Elliot 46); Vurnon Anita (Haris Vuckic 73), Mike Williamson(Remie Streete 73), Fabricio Coloccini (c) (Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa 46), Paul Dummett (Ayoze Perez 79);Gabriel Obertan (Adam Campbell 73) , Moussa Sissoko (Mehdi Abeid 46), Jack Colback (Lubo Satka 46), Rolando Aarons (Adam Armstrong 68); Emmanuel Riviere (Facundo Ferreyra 57), Yoan Gouffran (Remy Cabella 57)

Tricky, 
unpredictable and with a low centre of gravity, the left-winger was a 
constant menace for the Bundesliga side and they would have been 
relieved to see the back of him when he made way to a standing ovation 
midway through the second half.

By then, however, the damage had been done. The opening goal arrived after just 10 minutes.

Skipping
 clear of Kaan Ayhan down the left, Aarons served an enticing centre for
 Riviere who – with work still to be done – climbed above his marker 
before flashing an angled header into the bottom corner from 10 yards.

It
 was a classy finish and sure to please Pardew having seen his side 
barely muster an effort on goal - save for Gabriel Obertan's consolation
 - during the 3-1 defeat to Malaga 24 hours earlier.

Ayhan
 – who was turned inside and out by Aarons for the opener – tried to 
make amends when he slammed a 25-yard free-kick narrowly over Tim Krul's
 crossbar.

Improvement: Pardew will have been impressed with the performance after defeat to Malaga on Saturday

New man: Facundo Ferreyra made his debut for Newcastle having only signed on Sunday morning

But
 Newcastle doubled their advantage eight minutes after half-time, Aarons
 wriggling free of two blue shirts down the left being seeing his cross 
sail over the head of goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann and into the far corner.

It was fortuitous but well deserved and the skill in escaping his minders was worthy of the goal.

France international Remy Cabella was on as a second-half substitute and he added a little gloss to the scoreline with a classy finish on 72 minutes, set up by debutant Facundo Ferreyra who joined earlier in the day on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.

Adam
 Armstrong pressured Marvin Friedrich into a mistake and Cabella seized 
the loose ball before galloping clear on goal and slotting beyond 
Fahrmann.

Schalke
 did nick a consolation when Donis Avdijaj poked home from close range 
in stoppage-time but the night had belonged to man-of-the-match Aarons –
 Pardew will be hoping it's the first of many.
