A 52-year-old man has been arrested after a commuter was filmed racially abusing a woman on the London Underground.

The video, which has been posted on YouTube, shows the drunk man launching a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent woman.

Commuters were left horrified as the man, from Watford, Hertfordshire, reeled off a series of insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch'.

Shocking: The 52-year-old man launches a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent Japanese passenger

Abuse: He reels off insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch'

He has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, police have confirmed.

In an expletive-littered rant, lasting almost six minutes, the man claims his uncle died in the River Kwai during the Second World War.

He then aggressively points his finger at the young woman and accuses her of torturing his relative.

'You tortured him. Get yourself off the train, get yourself off the train,' he can be heard telling the passenger, who is sat on the other side of the tube on the Bakerloo line.

'You're nasty people. I mean this s***. You're nasty people. 'F*** off, get out of my country.' 

Illogical: He aggressively points his finger at the female passenger and accuses her of torturing his uncle

The unidentified man, who appears to be under the influence of alcohol, then repeatedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye' - adding: 'Don't you torture my relatives'.

He ignores the shocked woman's cries of 'I'm not nasty. You're nasty', before turning his attention to the English man filming the footage and asking where he comes from.

The passenger replies: 'Does it matter, really? Are you going to start sorting everyone on the train, man, one by one? Why are you blasting at her? What have you got against the Japanese?'

Leaning forward, the man shouts: 'They killed my f****** two f****** cousins in the Second World War.' 

'But she didn't kill your cousins, did she?' asks the passenger. 'Why is she going to apologise? What has she done to you?'

The
man, pointing his finger at the Japanese woman, replies 'She doesn't 
even f****** realise that she's a bad man. The Japanese are bad - same 
as the Germans.'

Menacing: The unidentified man then repetedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye'

Despite the cameraman's best efforts to calm him down, the man then becomes increasingly violent - threatening to knock him out in 'one punch'.

'I’m ex-Parachute Regiment! What do you know? You're a f****** boy man. Shut the f*** up,' he says.

'I’ve done two tours in Northern Ireland and the Falklands. Don’t even f****** look at me.'

He then produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig, before dangling the bottle menacingly in the passenger's face.

'Do you want some of that?' he asks threateningly. 'No, because you don't drink.'

A British Transport Police spokesman 
said: 'A 52-year-old man from Watford was arrested on Saturday, October 
19, on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence.

'An
investigation was launched after we were made aware of a YouTube clip 
of a man using racist language on board a Bakerloo line train.'

She added that the man has been bailed, pending enquiries. He is expected to be brought before magistrates on October 30.

The abuse is not the first of its kind to be filmed on the Underground.

Last year, a woman was jailed for 21 weeks for hurling racist abuse at fellow passengers while drunk.

Jacqueline Woodhouse, then 42, snarled at stunned commuters seated beside her: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.'

Her champagne-fuelled rant was recorded by a passenger, who posted the 
seven-minute clip on YouTube where it caused a sensation.

Speaking at Westminster Magistrates' Court at the time, District Judge Michael Snow said: 'Anyone viewing that would feel a deep sense of shame that our fellow citizens could be subject to such behaviour.'
