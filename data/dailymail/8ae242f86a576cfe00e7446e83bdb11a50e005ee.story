A family have caused outrage after putting up a fake Halloween tombstone with President Barack Obama's name on.

Jamilla Phillips says the decoration in a front yard in Edmond, Oklahoma, is offensive and lacks 'respect.'

She said she has just moved into the neighborhood, but after seeing the sign felt compelled to speak up, saying she was worried about the effect it would have on children.

 The sign is on the family's front lawn next to 'I told you I was sick' and 'I'm a gonner now.'

'He is the president of the United States and it actually is about respect,' Phillips said, reports Koco.

'It's a total respect thing because this person is still alive.'

But the Dockens family said they have put the decoration up in their yard for three years and have not received any complaints.

Dwayne Dockens said that making the fake tombstones had brought his family together and he has no intentions of taking them down. 

'[My family and I] made them a few years ago back when it was a big deal, questions up about [Obama's] birth certificate,' Dockens said.

'And we made all these ourselves so just thought it was kind of humorous and, you know, went ahead and put him in there as well.'
