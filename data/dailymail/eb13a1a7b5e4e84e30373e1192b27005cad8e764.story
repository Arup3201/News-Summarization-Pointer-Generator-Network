A senior federal nuclear expert has urged regulators to shut down the last operating nuclear plant in California until it is established it will be safe if the Golden State suffers another earthquake.

Michael Peck, who was the on-site inspector of Diablo Canyon plant for five years, says in a confidential document that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is not applying the safety rules it set out for the plant's operation.

The 42-page  file says that no one knows whether the facility's key equipment can withstand stronger shaking - and only yesterday the state was hit by another quake, striking with a magnitude of 6.0.

Last reactor standing: The nearly 30-year-old Diablo Canyon is the last operating nuclear plant left in California

In the file, Mr Peck, an NRC employee, writes that continuing to run the reactors 'challenges the presumption of nuclear safety'.

Diablo Canyon's reactors, which are nearly 30 years old, produce enough electricity for more than three million people annually.  

The former site inspector filed the document as an appeals notice to the NRC in July 2013. Usually the appeals process takes no longer than 120 days but there is yet to be a ruling.  

The NRC and plant owner Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) insist the facility is safe and that it complies with its operating license, including earthquake safety standards.

The disaster preparedness of the world's nuclear plants was thrown into the spotlight in 2011 following the meltdowns at Fukushima in Japan, which caused irreversible damage to the environment and forced 300,000 people to evacuate the area.

A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, leading the NRC to reevaluate plant safety in the U.S..

Yesterday a magnitude 6.0 quake struck northern California, injuring dozens and cutting out power to thousands of people, but causing no problems for Diablo Canyon. 

The conflict between Mr Peck and the NRC stems from the 2008 discovery of the Shoreline fault, which snakes offshore about half a mile from the reactors. 

According to Mr Peck’s filing, PG&E research in 2011 determined that any of three nearby faults – the Shoreline, Los Osos and San Luis Bay – are capable of producing significantly more ground motion during an earthquake than was accounted for in the design of important plant equipment. 

In the case of San Luis Bay, it is as much as 75 per cent more, Mr Peck claims.

The analysis says PG&E failed to demonstrate that the equipment would continue to work if exposed to the stronger shaking, violating its operating license.

It adds that the agency should shut the facility down until it is proven that piping, reactor cooling and other systems can deal with the stronger shaking.

The NRC says Diablo Canyon’s reactors can withstand the largest projected earthquake from the faults, and says the largest threat is from the Hosgri fault, a crack discovered in the 1970s about three miles from the plant's site, by which time construction already underway. 

Mr Peck said in the document that continuing with the reactors 'challenges the presumption of nuclear safety'

Mr Peck, who is now a senior instructor at the NRC’s training center in Tennessee, declined to comment on the filing.

The NRC also said it would not comment on the document. 

PG&E spokesman Blair Jones said the NRC had looked into the threat of earthquakes on the reactor and had found Diablo Canyon to be 'seismically safe'.  

Mr Jones said that the core issue involving earthquake shaking was resolved in the late 1970s with seismic retrofitting of the plant.

If the plant did close to strengthen its defense against earthquakes, it would not be the first in California to do so. 

The Humboldt Bay plant, which was within 3,000 yards of three faults, was shut down in 1976 to reinforce its ability to withstand possible earthquakes.

Restarting it became more difficult and costly than projected and the plant never reopened.
