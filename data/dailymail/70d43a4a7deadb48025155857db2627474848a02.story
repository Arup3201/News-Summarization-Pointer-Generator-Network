A teenager is reportedly in a coma after falling off a skateboard whilst filming himself for an appearance on Anderson Cooperâ€™s new show.

A producer for the daytime programme 'Anderson' allegedly encouraged the boy to record his wild behaviour for a show on the teenage mind.

Mr Cooper, 44, who has only been hosting the show for three weeks, is 'very saddened' by the incident and is praying for the boy and his family.

Upset: Anderson Cooper is 'very saddened' by the teenager who is reportedly in a coma after falling off a skateboard whilst filming himself for the show

A representative for Mr Cooper said producers had been working with the boy and his parents on the science behind the teenage brain.

'As part of our routine process, we ask guests for video footage and photos,' he told Gawker. 'We did not provide the family with a camera.'

But on the morning the boy was supposed to travel to New York City, producers found out that he had been injured.

He was pushed to 'film the crazy stuff you do' but suffered a severe head injury when falling from his skateboard, a source told Gawker.

This left the teenager in a coma and the show never aired.

'I was very saddened to hear the news of this accident,' Mr Cooper told Gawker through a spokesman.

He
added that he wanted to express his 'deepest concerns' to the teenager 
and his 'thoughts and prayers' are with the boy and his family.

Emmy-award winner Mr Cooper is a Yale
University graduate and joined CNN almost 10 years ago after working 
for ABC and Channel One News.

Mr Cooper's talk show only began airing on September 12 but it has already been charged with emotion.

'I was very saddened to hear the news of this accident, and want to express my deepest concerns for the teenager who was injured'

Anderson Cooper

Two weeks ago the host's mother Gloria Vanderbilt spoke to her son about his brother's suicide in 1988.

The 87-year-old fashion designer told her youngest son how she wanted to jump too but stopped herself when she thought of him.

Holding back tears, the mother and son recalled the tragedy when Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, who was 23, took his own life at their New York City penthouse apartment.

'I still run through it,' she said. 'He was sitting on the wall with one foot on there and one foot hanging over and he kept looking down.

'And I kept begging him and then when he went, he went like an athlete, and hung over the wall like this.

Challenging topics: The Anderson show has already had its fair share of emotional discussions, with Mr Cooper's mom Gloria Vanderbilt discussing the suicide of his brother

'And I said, "Carter, come back", and for a minute I thought that he was going to come back, but he didn't. He let go.'

She told her son, who was 21 at the time of the tragedy, 'There was a moment when I thought I was going to jump over after him.

'I thought of you and it stopped me.'

The CNN newsreader told his mother she was an inspiration.

'You have survived so many things,' he said. 'The loss of your father when you were an infant, the loss of Carter, of my dad, your husband and so many others.

'It hasn't made you tough. It hasn't hardened you. You're still open to experience and open to new loss and open to new heartbreak and to new love.'
