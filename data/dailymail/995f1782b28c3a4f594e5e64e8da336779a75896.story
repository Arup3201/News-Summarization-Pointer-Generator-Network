This is the part-time snake charmer who catches deadly species every day - despite being allergic to most anti-venoms.

Humble taxi driver M.S. Balasubramaniam began catching the animals more than 30 years ago and believes he has now freed more than 40,000 from homes in Mysore city, southern India. 

The serpent-lover has only been bitten four times, but when he was, doctors discovered their treatments were prompting a severe allergic reaction which could kill him.

That means Mr Balasubramaniam's next call-out could be his last - but despite the dangers, he refuses to give up.

Passion: Humble taxi driver M.S. Balasubramaniam believes he has freed more than 40,000 snakes from homes in Mysore city, southern India - and refuses to quit his vocation despite being allergic to anti-venoms

'I'll be there in an hour': The snake-catcher multi-tasking as he lures an animal out of a house in his home city

He says he carries out his work out of a love for the animals, which have been displaced by humankind.

'Snakes are not as poisonous as human beings,' he said. 'I do not fear getting bitten - snakes are our friends.

'Snakes
 are everywhere here around Mysore. We are the trespassers - we take 
away their homes and they have nowhere to go - so I help return them 
peacefully to what's left of their habitat.'

The snake-catcher believes there around 25 species in Mysore, including several non-venomous or near-harmless species like sand boas, tree snakes and rat snakes.

But the city also has several highly dangerous animals. More than half his catches have been cobras, and he has encountered species including the saw-scaled viper - one of south Asia's most dangerous snakes.

Safe: Mr Balasubramaniam keeps snakes in specially-adapted jars before releasing them into the wild

'We are the trespassers,' said the snake-catcher, who had to prevent his son doing the same job. 'We take away their homes and they have nowhere to go, so I help return them peacefully to what's left of their habitat'

Experienced: Mr Balasubramaniam has caught snakes for 30 years and has only been bitten four times

The animals often choose to live near human settlements, bury themselves in sand and are quick to bite when they feel threatened.

Mr Balasubramaniam rounds up around 10 snakes per day from homes, schools and workplaces around the city.

To demonstrate his fearlessness, he even kisses cobras' heads to prove they cannot harm him.

His son also began catching snakes until he was discouraged by his father - who carries out his jobs in between ferrying children to school in his taxi.

The snake-catcher added: 'I rarely take a day off. On 
my busiest days I can attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than 
80km across the city.

Character: He is well-known in the city of Mysore and attracts large crowds of onlookers wherever he goes

Records: Mr Balasubramaniam keeps a careful count of the number and species of snakes he catches

'I rarely take a day off,' he said. 'On my busiest days I attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than 80km'

Environmentalist: The snake catcher's cheery slogans on his taxi include 'we are all guests to nature'

'Some 
days I may get only one call, others ten, but never a day goes by where I
 do not get a call from distressed persons who need help removing a 
snake.'

And he refuses to charge his clients for removing snakes from their homes, cars, water tanks and workplaces, instead receiving donations of between 10 rupees (10p) and 100 (£1).

'I cannot charge because then people will kill the snake rather than pay,' he said.
