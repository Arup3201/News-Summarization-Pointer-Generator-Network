Police are working closely with event organisers to increase security measures in the lead up to one of Sydney's biggest celebrations - New Year's Eve - just days after Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned of heightened terrorist 'chatter'.

It comes as a terror expert told the Sydney Morning Herald he believes another attack will transpire 'in the next 12 months'.

'I wouldn't want to put a percentage on it, but I think in the next 12 months something else will happen, either in Australia or in Indonesia directed at Australians,' claimed Jeff Lewis, terrorism expert at RMIT.

Mr Abbott warned on Christmas Eve of heightened terrorist chatter following the Martin Place siege nearly two weeks ago.

'We do need to be conscious of the fact that the terror threat remains high. There are people who would do us harm and who can do us harm,' Mr Abbott said, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'I do want to reassure you though that our law enforcement agencies and our police forces and our security agencies will be working around the clock to keep you as safe as possible over the holiday season, as they do at all times.'

The City of Sydney Council is anticipating more than a million revellers to attend its major New Year's Eve event.

Assistant commissioner for NSW Police, Mick Fuller, further told the Sydney Morning Herald he is unaware of details surrounding any threats to Sydney on the last day of the year.

But in an interview with the Herald yesterday, a terrorism expert from RMIT University in Melbourne said another attack is likely next year.

Although Jeff Lewis was reluctant to make any predictions he said: 'I think in the next 12 months something else will happen, either in Australia or in Indonesia directed at Australians.'

Less than a fortnight after the Martin Place siege tragedy, there was plenty of visible security around the MCG and Sydney Harbour on Friday for two of Australia's iconic sporting events - The Boxing Day Test and Sydney to Hobart yacht race. 

Security at the MCG was at a level usually only seen for the AFL grand final or the Anzac Day blockbuster.

There were added checkpoints on Brunton Ave and car boots were searched before entering Yarra Park.

The police presence in and around the ground seemed normal for a major event.

'We are in regular contact with police and the relevant authorities to ensure we have the most appropriate security measures in place,' a Cricket Australia spokesman said.

'The safety of players, officials and fans is our highest priority.'

On Sydney Harbour, there was the usual obvious presence of police and NSW Maritime officers to keep vessels outside the race exclusion zone as the fleet set off for Hobart.

However, event organisers said there were no extra security measures in place for the start.
