British-based Marussia have said they are ‘shocked’ ‘angered’ and ‘deeply saddened’ by claims they contributed to Jules Bianchi’s life-threatening crash at the Japanese Grand Prix.

It was reported that the Frenchman, whose condition remains critical after he ploughed into the back of a tractor  during the rain-lashed race, didn’t slow down under waved yellow flags and was even urged to go faster by his team.

But Marussia have issued a response to the claims which they have described as ‘entirely false’.

‘The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations,’ a statement released by the Banbury-based outfit said on Wednesday.

‘At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumours and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules’ accident.

‘However, given that these allegations are entirely false, the team has no alternative but to address these.’

Marussia, eighth in the constructors’ championship after Bianchi claimed the team’s first-ever points’ finish at the Monaco Grand Prix, insisted that telemetry provided to the FIA proved Bianchi did decrease his speed before he lost control of his car. This has since been examined and confirmed by race director Charlie Whiting.

Whiting told a media briefing at the Russian Grand Prix last week: 'I know what speed he left the track at. We have seen the data from all cars, and everyone slowed down.

'Some didn't slow down much, some a lot. We don't need to go into how much he slowed down compared to others. He did slow down; it is a matter of degree.'

Marussia also provided the FIA with a full transcript of its radio communication with Bianchi during the race, and insist that it proved they never made any instruction for him to ignore the yellow flags deployed after Adrian Sutil’s spin minutes before Bianchi's crash.

Bianchi remains in a grave condition at Mie University Hospital and on Monday his family said he still faces a 'number of medical challenges'.

The 25-year-old’s parents and siblings have been beside his hospital bed since the accident, and his father Philippe said he  fears the worst outcome.

‘Every time the phone rings we know it could be the hospital to say Jules is dead,’ Philippe Bianchi said on Tuesday.

‘The doctors have said that it is already a miracle; that nobody has ever survived such a serious accident, but Jules does not give up.

‘One day he seems a little better, another a bit worse. The doctors don't say. The damage in the impact was great, but they don't know how it will evolve.’

During the course of Tuesday 14th October, a number of media reports emerged suggesting:

1. That Jules Bianchi did not slow down under the double waved yellow flags shown after Adrian Sutil had spun off in the wet conditions

and

2. That the team urged Jules to go faster during the double waved yellow flag period in order to keep Marcus Ericsson behind.

The Marussia F1 Team is shocked and angered by these allegations. At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital, and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family, it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumours and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules’ accident. However, given that these allegations are entirely false, the team has no alternative but to address these.

Regarding point 1, Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags. That is an irrefutable fact, as proven by the telemetry data, which the team has provided to the FIA. In the FIA press conference which took place in Sochi on Friday 10 October, Charlie Whiting, the FIA’s Race Director, confirmed that the team had provided such data, that he himself had examined this data and that Jules did slow.

Regarding point 2, an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team, and also a written transcript thereof, were provided to the FIA. It is quite clear from the transmission and the transcript that at no point during the period leading up to Jules’ accident did the team urge Jules to drive faster or make any comments suggesting that he should do so.

The team sincerely hopes that, having clarified these facts, it can now avoid any further distractions to its primary focus at this time, which is providing support for Jules and his family.
