The body of a high school teacher who disappeared during a cyclone more than three years ago has been found in scrubland in Western Australia.

Tracy Margaret Marshall, 35, vanished in the town of Karratha, in the Pilbara region 1500km north of Perth during severe tropical cyclone Carlos on February 21, 2011.

Ms Marshall's car, which had overheated and broken down  east of Karratha was found unoccupied on the same day as the local community was bracing for the cyclone to hit.

At the time Ms Marshall had been treated for depression and hallucinations, and her husband had been desperate to fly her to Perth because there was no psychiatrist in the remote Pilbara town. 

Body in bushland: the discovery of remains in the Western Australian scrub being identified as those of high school teacher Tracy Margaret Marshall (pictured) brings to a close a sad ordeal for her family. Ms Marshall's husband had been desperate to get her help after she began hallucinating but no psychiatrist was available in the remote Pilbara town of Karratha

Immediate search efforts were hampered at the time by the arrival of Carlos, which brought gale force winds of up to 140km/h and caused significant damage.

Last month in the same area as Ms Marshall's car had been found, a member of the public discovered human remains.

Police say forensic test have now proven they are those of Ms Marshall, but it was unclear how she died.

The discovery brings to a close a sad ordeal for the family of Ms Marshall, who disappeared after she walked out of the mental health unit of the local Nickol Bay Hospital.

Sad saga for family: After high school teacher Tracy Marshall (pictured) descended into depression and hallucinations her husband had decided 'things were just spinning out of control' and had planned to fly her 1500km south to Perth to receive proper psychiatric care, but she walked out of a mental health unit and drove her car 50km before it broke down during severe tropical cyclone Carlos

Ms Marshall had been undergoing treatment after she became stressed and depressed working as a high school teacher.

She had quit her job and started exhibiting odd behaviour, including having hallucinations in the week leading up to her disappearance.

On the day she disappeared, her car was found abandoned on a road 50km out of Karratha. Her father issued an appeal, acknowledging his daughter had personal problems but saying she had never previously given them cause for concern.

'It's been a very worrying and stressful time for us as you can well imagine, we'd just like to try and get Tracey back', Quinton Bricknell said at the time.

A coronial inquest held last year heard Ms Marshall had attended the Pilbara Health and Drug Service four times in the week before she vanished, but was told there was no a psychiatrist available in Karratha for two weeks.

Her husband Iain Marshall claimed she had woken him up wanting him to perform an exorcism, claiming she had a cleft foot and saw the devil.

When they went camping, Ms Marshall had displayed more bizarre behaviour and the next day she told her husband about several suicide attempts.

Ms Marshall had also been tap dancing and waving a tube around calling it 'Excalibur' before reciting the Lord's Prayer.

Mr Marshall  had planned to fly his wife to Perth for psychiatric treatment on the day she disappeared as 'things were just spinning out of control' and he did not want her to have to wait to see a psychiatrist.Ms Marshall was taken back to hospital, where she was put under overnight observation but disappeared the next morning.
