Whether it's opening emergency exits on a plane or throwing hot noodles on a flight attendant, Chinese tourists seem to have a penchant for making headline news.

And now a helpful guide has been published with a list of do's and don'ts to help them along their way, and keep them out of trouble, when on their travels.

Chinese media agency Xinhua has put together a list of tips for travellers, which includes details about specific laws and customs in countries around the world.

China's state-led media agency Xinhua has devised a helpful guide for tourists travelling abroad

Tourists are advised not to talk about pigs or wear clothing with images of pigs when travelling to Dubai, while those trekking in Fiji are told to steer clear of pilfering coral as a memento.

And no matter where in the world you are dining, you shouldn't snap your fingers at a waiter - that kind of behaviour is for dogs, according to the guide.

Xinhua is also telling Chinese holidaymakers to resist the temptation to pose and 'say cheese' when standing next to a Masai warrior in Kenya, and smoking should not be done unless they can 'see the sky.'

The last few months have seen a string of embarrassing and high-profile incidents of bad behaviour by Chinese tourists, denting their reputation worldwide.

Two passengers aboard a flight in China were jailed in January after opening the plane’s emergency exit

During a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing last month a couple scalded a Thai stewardess with hot water and noodles and threatened to blow up the plane after a heated exchange.

At the time state media branded the passengers 'barbarians' and four of the tourists have since been blacklisted by the provincial tourist board.

Just days later a plane was nearly forced to return after a brawl broke out between four women on a flight from mainland China to Hong Kong over a noisy baby.

Also in December, a Chinese passenger on board an internal Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu sparked a safety scare by yanking open an emergency exit just before a plane was due to take off to 'get some fresh air', Southern Metropolis Daily reported.

And now authorities in China have said they will monitor and rank incidents of misbehaviour by their  tourists abroad. The reports will be  passed on to tour operators and travel agents for them to decide whether to do business with the tourists again.

The program, put forward by China's National Tourism Administration (NTA), is designed to  curb incidents of violent or disruptive behaviour by mainland tourists while travelling.

NTA chairman Li Jinzao said that the information would be given to travel companies to allow them to decide 'whether to sell the person that ticket, or whether to let them take my flight,' according to South China Morning Post.

The new classification system will be launched in the second quarter and will also include information on the number of complaints received by attractions and hotels, how many had been dealt with and – of those that had been handled – how many customers had been satisfied with the outcome. 

Authorities in China are now monitoring the behaviour of its people when travelling abroad

This isn't the first time that Chinese authorities have spoken out on the issue. Wang Yang, one of China's four vice premiers, gave a disparaging view of Chinese tourists in 2013.

He was quoted by the Guardian as saying: 'They speak loudly in public, carve characters on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red, spit anywhere and [carry out] some other uncivilized behaviour. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad impact.'

In 2013, the government introduced a new set of laws, primarily to regulate tour operators, including a clause advising Chinese tourists to behave well wherever they went in the world.
