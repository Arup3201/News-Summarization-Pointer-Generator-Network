Anzor Tsarnaev told The Associated Press on Sunday that he is 'really sick' and his blood pressure had spiked.

Tsarnaev said last week that he planned to travel from Russia to the U.S. with the hope of seeing his younger son, who is under arrest, and burying his elder son, who was killed in a clash with police.

The news comes days after it was revealed that the suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, was placed on a CIA watchlist 18 months before the marathon attack.

Ailing: Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of Boston Marathon bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, says that he is 'really sick' and his blood pressure had spiked, forcing him to cancel a trip to the U.S.

Tsarnaev confirmed that he is staying
in Chechnya, a province in southern Russia, but did not specify whether
he had been hospitalized.

Until Friday, he and the suspects' mother had been living in the neighboring province of Dagestan.

The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva claimed she had to call an ambulance for him on Thursday but did not elaborate on what happened.

It was revealed last week that both parents have left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia.

She was never planning to accompany her husband to the U.S. because she faces felony shoplifting charges here.

On April 25, the parents held a bizarre press conference in which 
they claimed that the gruesome carnage of the Boston attacks, which killed
three people and injured more than 250, were staged by the U.S. government.

Enraged: Anzor Tsarnaev and his wife Zubeidat gesture at the gathered journalists at the press conference alongside the bombing suspects' aunt Patimat Suleymanova

'America took my kids away from me,' she cried. 'I’m sure my kids were not involved in anything.'

The mother of the suspected bombers, 
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, went so far as to 
claim that the blood covering the streets after the blasts was in fact 
paint.

The couple's eldest son, Tamerlan, was killed 
in a police shootout last Friday and Dzhokhar was taken into custody - alive, but badly injured - less than 24 hours later in Watertown, Massachusetts following a massive manhunt.

After spending nearly a week in a Boston 
hospital recovering from gunshot wounds sustained during a firefight 
with police, Dzhokhar was transferred 
to the Federal Medical Center Devens on Friday.

He has been charged in the marathon attacks and is facing a maximum sentence of the death penalty or life in prison.

The Tsarnaev family emigrated to the U.S. a decade ago, but both parents returned to Russia last year.

The father said Thursday that he was planning to travel to the U.S. as soon as Friday, but hadn't yet bought a plane ticket.

Banging the table in front of him, 
Anzor said: 'I am going to the United States. I want to say that I am 
going there to see my son, to bury the older one.

'I don't have any bad intentions. I don't plan to blow up anything. I am not angry at anyone. I want to go find out the truth.'

Zubeidat also described a figure known only as 'Misha' - who has been pinpointed as a source of radicalization for her son Tamerlan.

She said that he was a 'very nice man,' of Armenian origin and living in Boston. 'Misha' is also apparently a convert to the Islamic faith.

Anzor
has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities - and 
would face further interviews if he ever gets to the U.S. 

Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaev launched into a bizarre rant in 
which she claimed she would not care if she or her youngest son were killed
by U.S. authorities.

'If they are going to kill him, I don't 
care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar.

'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my 
youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this.
And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say 
Allahu akbar!'

Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store

She said that 
the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, 
adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.'

U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings.

ABC News reported last week that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest.

If she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she 
could be arrested on an outstanding warrant.

Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store.

She was charged with two 
counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after 
allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, 
Mass. location in June 2012.

She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up.

The Lord & Taylor location is 
not the same as the one on Boylston Street in Boston, where a 
surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son 
dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack.

The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen 
pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to 
speaking with anyone.

Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus

'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.'

The images and video she is referring to were taken by a resident of Watertown, Mass. and posted on his blog. They appear to show two men taking shelter behind a vehicle and taking aim at police 
officers.

The men are then
seen hauling out a pressure cooker bomb from a car and detonating it, filling the 
street with smoke.

The photographs, taken on the 
eyewitness's phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the 
scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that 
left one man dead.

Authorities say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ended the firefight when he jumped in the car
- which the suspects had allegedly stolen earlier - and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he also ran over his brother Tamerlan.

Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks.

'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother,' she said.

She added to CNN that she had spoken 
to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved 
her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat.

Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, 
Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying 
that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes.

The statement read: 'Our heart goes 
out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many 
innocent people hurt after such a callous act.

Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening 

'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused.

'We
don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation 
and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during 
this difficult time.'

The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya.

Their
sons had spent little time in either place before the family moved to 
the U.S. a decade ago, but the elder son was in Russia for six months 
last year.
