Andres Iniesta is set for a return to action after a month on the sidelines with a leg injury.

The Barcelona midfielder injured the soleus muscle in his right calf during their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on October 25.

Iniesta has missed five matches for Barcelona and two matches for the Spain national team during his recovery.

Team doctors declared him fit on Saturday morning and he trained on the Tito Vilanova pitch at the Ciutat Esportiva training complex with the first-team squad.

The team went go-karting instead of a training session on Friday as they prepare for Sunday's La Liga match at Valencia.

Barca are currently two points behind Real in the table but that could extend to five by the time they line-up at the Mestalla as their rivals play at Malaga on Saturday night.
