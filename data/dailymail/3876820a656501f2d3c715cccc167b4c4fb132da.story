While festive leftovers for many of us might consist of cold turkey and mince pies a plenty, these elephants received a rather different treat.

The animals at Berlin Zoological Garden in Germany were pictured enjoying Christmas trees donated to the zoo by local sellers who had not sold them.

The post-Christmas tradition at the zoo, which took place on Saturday, dates back around two decades - and is usually carried out in January.

Young and old elephants at the zoo are annually seen playing with the trees before eating them, because they are attracted by their strong smell.

The zoo only accepts trees from local vendors rather than from the public, because of a risk they could contain chemicals or leftover decorations.

Christmas trees inside houses also are not as fresh and juicy as those at cold outdoor markets - which is how the elephants like them.

An elephant keeper at the 169-year-old zoo said following the ceremony last year that the animals ‘love it’ when their ‘Christmas feast’ begins.
