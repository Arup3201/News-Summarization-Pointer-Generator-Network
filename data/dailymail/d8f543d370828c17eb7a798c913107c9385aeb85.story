A 10-year-old primary school pupil weighs an astonishing 20 stone, figures have revealed.

The child, who has not been named, narrowly topped the list of the most obese children in Coventry and Warwickshire, where the data was collected.

The Year 6 pupil tipped the scales at 19st 7lbs, making them one of the heaviest children in the country.

Another child of the same year weighed just over 18st, a third weighed 18st 6lbs and a fourth weighed 16st 7lbs.

Shocking: The 10-year-old child, who has not been named, is one of the fattest children in the country (file picture)

The children were weighed at school as part of an annual child measurement programme and it is now known if they were male or female. 

The latest data has been supplied by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the official source of NHS data.

Coventry City Council estimates there are about 10,000 primary school children in the area who are classed as either overweight or clinically obese - including a handful of local youngsters who weighed in at more than 16st during health checks in Year 6.

Many will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases.

National figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre in December revealed the proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight had actually fallen for the first time in six years.

A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent -
 measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13
 were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous 
year.

In Reception, the number of obese and 
overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year 
and is lower than seven years ago.

And
 in December, it was revealed a ten-year-old schoolgirl in Birmingham 
weighed at 22 stone 11lbs, closely followed by six youngsters of the 
same age who weighed 19 stone.

Tam
 Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline: 'It is a truly 
horrific problem we have. The Government says obesity is falling in 
children, which it might be in affluent areas.

Denial: Experts say many parents believe nothing needs to be done about their overweight children - because they 'look healthy and happy'

'But in many cases, it's about volume - fat people are getting fatter. Also, many parents don't realise their child is overweight - quite often because they are fat themselves.

'It is horrific figures such as these which show just how big the problem of childhood obesity is becoming.'

Berni Lee, public health consultant for Coventry City Council, said the main challenge is changing the attitudes of parents with overweight children who believe nothing needs to be done because theirchild looks healthy and happy.

A recent survey suggests most parents ignore advice offered by the National Child Measurement Programme.

She added: 'We’ve become accustomed to the overweight because it’s so common in our society.

'We are not recognising it when we see it because people only hear about the extreme cases, people think it’s an extreme state.

'The 19-and-a-half stone child is not the problem, although it’s a problem for them.

'The problem is the [other] children...who are either overweight  or very overweight.

Worry: Millions of schoolchildren will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases

'But we shouldn’t focus on weight, we should focus on the behaviours, their eating and the activity.

'If we did this healthy weights will naturally follow.'

A spokesman at Warwickshire County Council said: 'Children identified as overweight or obese through the programme are pro-actively offered weight management support.

'There are protocols in place to ensure that the family/carer receive an individual child’s results within three weeks of being weighed and measured.

'Up to three weeks after this, the school health team’s Family Change4Life Advisory Service will telephone the family and offer weight management support.

'If calls are not returned, the school health team will follow up in writing, but it is ultimately the family’s decision whether to take up the offer of help or not. If any safeguarding issues are considered, a referral to Children’s Services may be made.'
