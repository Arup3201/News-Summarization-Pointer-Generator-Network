A young mother died less than a month after the birth of her longed-for first child as a result of ‘extremely rare’ complications, an inquest heard.

Hayley Constable and her partner Martin Fitzpatrick were thrilled when son Alfie was born by Caesarean section a year after she suffered a miscarriage.

But the 27-year-old’s scar became infected after she took him home. Despite being given antibiotics by her GP, her condition deteriorated and she died in hospital.

Now Alfie is at nursery and asks his father why he doesn’t have a mother like his classmates.

Grief: Martin Constable with son Alfie. Heartbreakingly, Alfie sees other children with their mothers and asks his father why he doesn't have one of his own

Hayley Constable (pictured just after the birth), 27, was said to have been 'absolutely thrilled' when son Alfie was born - a year after she suffered a miscarriage

Mr Fitzpatrick, 31, who gave up his 
job as a newspaper sales executive to look after his son – now two and a
 half – said: ‘He’s started nursery and asks why he doesn’t have a mummy
 like the other kids.

‘He’s a lovely little boy, a normal happy two-year-old, but it’s incredibly sad to hear him asking questions about Hayley.’

Yesterday her family claimed doctors had failed to treat the infection promptly and missed a chance to save her life.

But a pathologist told the inquest Miss Constable’s death was due to an extremely rare set of complications that caused respiratory failure and a stroke.

Miss Constable, who had miscarried in February 2010, went into labour in March 2011 and was taken to Fairfield Hospital maternity unit in Bury.

After she spent two days in labour, doctors decided to deliver Alfie by C-section.

Two days later Miss Constable a claims technician, was allowed to take Alfie home to Ramsbottom, near Bury.

Her mother Anne Constable, 52, a health visitor, told the inquest at Heywood, Rochdale: ‘She was thrilled to become a mum. She was so happy, she was breastfeeding and everything appeared fine.’

Five days later Miss Constable texted her mother to say that she had lumps on the sides of her scar. The community midwife reassured her that the wound appeared to be healing.

But the following day she began to suffer worsening pain and a GP prescribed painkillers and antibiotics, Mrs Constable said.

The
 pain continued to worsen and she was admitted to Fairfield Hospital, 
where her blood pressure dropped and she was unable to move.

Because she was allergic to penicillin, doctors were initially restricted in their choice of antibiotics to treat her.

The following day she was transferred to North Manchester General Hospital, where the infection was drained. That afternoon she was struggling to breathe and was put on a ventilator. Doctors told the family she was suffering with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

‘They told us she might have hours to live or days, or she could recover,’ said Mrs Constable. She was transferred to Glenfield Hospital in Leicester but suffered a stroke and died.

Pathologist Dr Alan Padwell told the inquest he had never seen a sequence of events where an infected caesarean section wound had resulted in breathing failure in this way.

Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Simon Nelson said Miss Constable died ‘due to a rare but recognised complication of necessary surgical intervention’.

Although the coroner did not criticise the doctors who treated her, Miss Constable’s family are taking legal action against Fairfield Hospital alleging that she could have lived if guidelines on identifying potentially serious infections had been followed.

Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Fairfield, said: ‘The Trust would like to express its sincere condolences to Miss Constable’ s partner, son and family in relation to these rare, but tragic circumstances.’
