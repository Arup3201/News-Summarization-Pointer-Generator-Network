Archeologists have been left scratching their heads after the unearthing of part of an ancient Egyptian sphinx in northern Israel.

The find has prompted Egyptologists to speculate as to how the stone-carved mythical creature travelled so many miles from its original resting place.

Some speculate that it may have been looted from the Egyptians thousands of years ago, while others suggest it was likely to have been given by Egypt as a gift to its neighbours.

Baffling: Australian excavation volunteer Joshua Talbot displays the remains of a Sphinx with a hieroglyphic inscription between its paws dating circa 3rd century BC, found during excavation in the Northern Israeli archeological site of the ancient Tel Hazor

It has taken almost a year for the paws and forearms of the granite statue to be painstakingly restored, exposing hieroglyphic writing.

The writing reveals that the sphinx was dedicated to Egyptian ruler Mycerinus, who ruled circa 2500 BC and was builder of the smaller of Giza's three great pyramids.

It is the first statue ever to have been found that was created for the leader, and the first time an Egyptian statue has ever been found in the ancient Levant region - today's Israel, Lebanon and Syria.

The writing also says: 'Beloved by the divine souls of Heliopolis.'

Archeologists have been left scratching their heads after finding the Egyptian sphinx with hieroglyphic inscription between its paws dating circa 3rd century BC at the Israeli dig

Egypt's magnificent Pyramids - one of the engineering marvels of all time - are situated at Giza just outside Cairo. The pyramids are generally believed to be tombs for the Pharaohs and/or a resurrection machine for the rulers' rebirth.

The remarkable and baffling find was stumbled upon by archeologists working in the Tel Hazor dig site, in Israel's Galilee in August 2012.

But only now having carefully removed the incrustation, are they able to clearly see the inscriptions.

Amnon Ben-Tor, an archaeology professor at the Hebrew University in charge of the Tel Hazor dig, told AFP that the sphinx would have originally been placed by the temple of Mycerinus.

His is the smallest of the three great pyramids at Giza, Cairo.

Tel Hazor was the capital of southern Canaan, founded circa 2,700 BC and at its peak covering approximately 200 acres and home to some 20,000 Canaanites. It was destroyed in the 13th century BC

So far, only parts of the feet and the face have been retrieved, but archaeologists hope to find more of the sphinx as they continue the dig.

Mr Ben-Tor believes the sphinx was brought to Tel Hazor 3,000 years ago, either as war booty or as a gift to the then ruler of Hazor by an ancient Egyptian king.

He said: 'That it arrived in the days of Mycerinus himself is unlikely, since there were absolutely no relations between Egypt and this part of the world then.

'Egypt maintained relations with Lebanon, especially via the ancient port of Byblos, to import cedar wood via the Mediterranean, so they skipped' today's northern Israel, he said.

Another option is that the statue was part of the plunders of the Canaanites, who in the late 17th and early 16th century BC ruled lower Egypt, the expert said.

'Egyptian records tell us that those 
foreign rulers... plundered and desecrated the local temples and did all
 kinds of terrible things, and it is possible that some of this looting 
included a statue like this one.'

But to Ben-Tor the most likely way the sphinx reached Tel Hazor is in the form of a gift sent by a later Egyptian ruler.

The small sphinx is believed to be the only one found from the pyramid of Myrcerinus - the smallest of Giza's great pyramids

'The third option is that it arrived in Hazor some time after the New Kingdom started in 1,550 BC, during which Egypt ruled Canaan, and maintained close relations with the local rulers, who were left on their thrones,' he said.

'In such a case it's possible the statue was sent by the Egyptian ruler to king of Hazor, the most important ruler in this region.'

Ben-Dor said the statue was most likely deliberately broken by new occupiers at Tel Hazor in an act of defiance to the old rule.

Finding the sphinx was 'unexpected,' said Ben-Tor, 'but fits' archaeological facts and findings. 'When you're in a bank, you find money,' he said.

Shlomit Blecher, who manages the Selz Foundation Hazor Excavations, was the archaeologist who unearthed the finding in August 2012.

'It was the last hour of the last day of the dig,' she told AFP of the moment of the find. 'We all leapt with joy and happiness, everyone was thrilled.'

'We hope the other pieces are here and that we find them in the near days,' she said.

The first and great pyramids at Giza was constructed by Khufu (also known as Cheops) the son of Sneferu.

Khufu ruled around 2589-2566 when the Old Kingdom of Egypt was nearing its peak of prosperity and could afford to build the vast structures.

Constructed of 2,300,000 blocks limestone and granite blocks, the total weight is 6.5 million tonnes.

The whole structure reached 140 metres in height and had a base length originally of 230 metres.

It is believed that the stone blocks were hauled up sloping ramps, lubricated by water, using manpower. 

The outer white face of the pyramid was finished with soother and polished limestone. Inside the pyramid are a number of chambers and passages.

The burial chamber is almost six meters tall, and was built by solid blocks of granite to prevent penetration.

It is believed that construction took 20 years. 

The original entrance to the great pyramid is on the North face, 15m high; the modern entrance is located several metres down and was forced in the 9th century. 

The other two pyramids were constructed by Menkaure (also known as Mycerinus), which is the smallest, and Khafre’s (who is also known as Chephren).

Khafre’s  pyramid looks higher than Khufu’s but it is actually half a metre smaller but built on higher ground.  

The most distinctive feature of Khafre's Pyramid is the topmost layer of smooth stones that are the only remaining casing stones on a Giza Pyramid. 

Some believe that the Sphinx has the face of Khafre.

Others argue that it was Khufu, and that it was part of Khufu’s pyramid complex.

And others believe that it was there before Khufu built his pyramid.

Due to the vast expense, the end of the Old Kingdom and the movement of the capital to Thebes, modern day Luxor, the Pharaohs started to be buried in tombs cut out of the rock in the Valley of the King and the construction of pyramids ceased.
