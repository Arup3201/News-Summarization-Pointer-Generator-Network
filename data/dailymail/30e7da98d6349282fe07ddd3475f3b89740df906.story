Former Arsenal flop Nicklas Bendtner has endured a torrid last 18 months, but the Danish striker's luck finally appears to be changing after a brace against Serbia took his recent tally to four goals in three games.

After scoring twice against Krasnodar in the Europa League for Wolfsburg, the 26-year-old repeated the feat on Friday to hand Denmark a 3-1 win over Serbia.

The latest success means Bendtner has now scored as many goals in his last three games as he did for Arsenal and Denmark in the whole of the 2013-14 season.

Nicklas Bednter celebrates scoring for Denmark against Serbia in their 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win

The former Gunner has now scored four goals in his last three games, the same as his tally for 2013-14

It is a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the former Gunner, who recently voiced his anger at having been made to warm the bench in north London last year. 

'It was a terrible situation. My last year at Arsenal was a waste of time,' Bendtner told Tipsbladet.

'It was worthless that Arsenal did not allow me to leave.

'A club like Arsenal could easily have found someone else to play my role. They would have had no trouble finding a player who could do what they wanted me to do.' 

Bendtner has hit a rich vein of form for Wolfsburg and he recently scored a double against FK Krasnodar

The 26-year-old had numerous injury problems during his time at Arsenal which kept him out of the team
