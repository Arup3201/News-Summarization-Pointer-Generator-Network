Jailed: David McDougall, 31, raped a disabled woman just five days after being released on bail on other rape charges, a court has heard

A sex offender raped a disabled woman just five days after being released on bail on other rape charges, a court has heard.

David McDougall, 31, carried out a string of rapes and other sexual and physical assaults on five women over a 15-year period in Fife, Scotland.

He kicked one of the victims while she was pregnant - and raped another in front her baby son.

But while awaiting trial for the offences, McDougall was released on bail at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.

Just five days later, he struck again, raping a 30-year-old woman with learning difficulties at her house on a night he knew she was alone.

Now, McDougall has been jailed for 10 years after being convicted of 14 charges, including six rapes and other sexual and physical offences, dating back to 1998.

The court heard that McDougall had been released on bail on May 28 last year while awaiting trial for attacks on five other females in the Fife towns of Methil, Buckhaven, Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy.

Although prosecutors had opposed bail, a sheriff allowed it and appeal judges upheld his decision.

But less than a week after walking out of Perth prison, McDougall raped the disabled woman on June 3 after turning up at her house, following her upstairs and trying to kiss her.

The victim said he then forced her to have sex, adding: 'I didn't have the courage to tell him to stop.'

McDougall initially denied being at the woman’s house on June 3 last year, but stains on the woman’s sheets were found to match his DNA.

Sentencing McDougall yesterday, Judge Michael O'Grady QC branded the sex offender a danger to all women.

He told him: 'You 
have been convicted of an utterly appalling catalogue of domestic and 
sexual offences. They are as bad as it has even been my misfortune to 
encounter.'

He added that his view that McDougall posed a significant danger to all women had been confirmed by a risk assessment report, which he said was 'deeply disturbing'.

Scene: The court heard that McDougall had been released on bail on May 28 last year while awaiting trial for attacks on five other females in the Fife towns of Methil (pictured), Buckhaven, Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy

Attack: Although prosecutors had opposed bail, a sheriff allowed it and appeal judges upheld his decision. But on June 3 last year, McDougall raped the disabled woman. Above, Kirkcaldy, where one attack took place

As well as jailing McDougall for
 10 years, Mr O'Grady handed him an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR), set at five years.

Introduced in June 2006, the OLR provides for the lifelong supervision of high risk violent and sexual offenders, even after they have been released from prison.

Mr O'Grady said he had set the order at five years because some of McDougall’s crimes pre-dated the lifelong 
restriction legislation

But he told McDougall the figure did not reflect when he would be released, adding: 'Responsibility for your release, if ever, is up to the parole board. My own view is that the prospect of your release is a distant one.'

Solicitor advocate Gordon Martin, 
defending, said the sex offender had accepted his involvement in 'almost all the charges' he was convicted of.

'For what it’s worth he has asked me to say he regrets 
any harm or distress he has caused his victims and the embarrassment he 
has caused his immediate family,' he added.
