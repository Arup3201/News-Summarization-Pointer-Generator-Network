Louis van Gaal can improve Manchester United's performances next season by 25 per cent, according to former Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes.

The Dutchman, who will take charge at Old Trafford after leading Holland at the World Cup, has a huge job on his hands after David Moyes' disastrous 10 months at the helm left United without Champions League football.

The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has already started rebuilding, having splashed out almost £60million on Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera.

Scholes, who worked at United alongside caretaker boss Ryan Giggs at the end of last season, believes the improvements under Van Gaal won't end with his summer acquisitions.

Writing in his Paddy Power blog, Scholes said: 'Right now, Manchester United fans (and myself) cannot wait for Louis van Gaal to get the job started at Old Trafford.

'It’s not a vintage Holland team he’s managing and Van Gaal has got them to the brink of a World Cup final. He’s going to have to perform a similar operation at United after a shocking season in 2013/2014.

'Van Gaal seems to have the Midas touch, and with his coaching reputation and vast experience he can bring a lot to the club. He’ll improve last year’s performance by 20/25 per cent, I feel.

'As well as the new signings, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, (and hopefully more to come) he’ll bring more out of the players who are already there. I’m actually really excited about next season.'
