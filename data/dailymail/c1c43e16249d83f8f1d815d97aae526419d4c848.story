The treatment of a 16-year-old girl who was kept in a police cell due to a lack of mental health beds has been called ‘unacceptable’ and ‘appalling’.

Over the weekend, a senior police officer disclosed how the schoolgirl had spent two nights in custody because there were no beds in NHS facilities anywhere in the UK.

And last night, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘It’s appalling that any patient should be taken into police custody due to a lack of mental health beds.

‘It’s particularly unacceptable that it should happen to a 16-year-old. The severe pressures on mental health services are leading to shocking situations across the country.’

He said that over the last four years there had been a drop of 1,500 mental health beds and 3,300 specialist nurses, despite the number of patients requiring care increasing by 30 per cent.

He added: ‘These cutbacks are having a devastating impact on those who desperately need care and support. It’s a terrible indictment of this country’s inadequate mental health provision.’

Paul Netherton, assistant chief constable at Devon and Cornwall Police, had taken to Twitter to reveal that the girl had been held in a cell since Thursday, and added: ‘The 16-year-old was detained on Thursday night, sectioned Friday lunchtime and still no place of safety available. This can’t be right!

Speaking later to BBC News, he said: ‘We shouldn’t have children, a schoolgirl, staying overnight in a custody block.’

She was arrested at Torbay Hospital, Torquay, after a breach of the peace and sectioned under the Mental Health Act. A bed in a local mental healthcare centre was later made available and she was moved on Saturday night.

Labour health spokesman Luciana Berger MP said: ‘This sad situation is becoming worryingly common. People shouldn’t face the indignity of being kept in police cells when they are at their most vulnerable.

‘The Government promised parity for mental health services, yet we’re going backwards.

‘This is an appalling reflection of the crisis in mental health services and the Government must get to grips with it.’

Mark Winstanley, chief executive of mental health charity Rethink, said: ‘Each year thousands of people with serious mental health problems are being held in police cells, including many children and teenagers, because the right services either don’t exist in their community or are completely overstretched.

‘As a result, people end up being held in police stations, or are simply left to fend for themselves. This has to change, as it is costing lives.’

The most recent figures show that up to 9,000 patients with mental health issues are detained in police cells a year, the youngest just 14 years old.

Mr Netherton said that in Devon alone, 750 patients had been held in custody so far this year. On hearing that a bed had been found for the girl, he tweeted that it was a ‘good result’.

A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘After details were provided to NHS England about the girl and her condition, a place was found locally within a few hours.

‘We are grateful for the help of the NHS in the area in identifying the place. It is worth noting that mental health crisis services have been expanding so that the number of people ending up in police cells is in fact down – but clearly more needs to be done.’
