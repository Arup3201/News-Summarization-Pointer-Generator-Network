International investigators have finally reached the MH17 crash site today after Ukraine agreed to a 24 hour ceasefire so they could gain access to the area.

It is the first time that the experts from the Netherlands and Australia have been able to go to the site, which appears to still be under control of pro-Russian separatists.

Fighting along the route to the wreckage between government troops and the separatists had kept them away.

It is expected that they will initially focus their efforts on retrieving bodies that are still on the site and collect victims' belongings.

It remains unclear exactly how many bodies remain and what condition they are in after being exposed for so long to the elements.

Earlier this afternoon, the investigators were allowed through a checkpoint leading to the crash site at the village of Rozsypne.

The convoy of investigators and Organization for Security and Cooperation officials were taken through the rebel-held city of Donetsk through the town of Debaltseve, which was earlier this week re-taken by government foces, and later back in rebel territory.

Armoured personnel carriers, waving the blue and yellow Ukrainian national flag could be seen in and around Debaltseve.

Medical teams from the Netherlands and Australia have also carried out a joint training exercise in case they need to evacuate personnel involved in the humaitarian mission in the Ukraine.

A delegation from Russia's state aviation body also said it hoped to visit the site, an agency spokesman said today.

The announcement of a ceasefire follows a plea from the UN for a truce to allow a stalled probe into the downing of the passenger jet to go ahead

Military spokesman Olekisy Dmytrashkivsky said that the ceasefire  was in response to an appeal by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon

Sergei Izvolsky told the AP that a delegation of Russian specialists from Rosaviatsiya was due in Kiev today to participate in the investigation.

Representatives of the Dutch and Ukrainian commissions would not comment on the arrival of Russian officials.

Continuing fighting has hindered access to the crash site, located in rebel-controlled territory in east Ukraine.

But earlier today the Ukrainian military announced that there would be a day-long pause to its  offensive to oust pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country.

The announcement follows a plea from the UN for a truce to allow a stalled probe into the downing of the passenger jet to go ahead.

In Eindhoven, Dutch and Australian medical personnel conducted a joint exercise at a military base

The aim of the exercise was to prepare in case they needed to evacuate personnel involved in the mission in the Ukraine

Military spokesman Olekisy Dmytrashkivsky said that the move was in response to an appeal by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, adding: 'We have taken a decision not to conduct military operations on this so-called "day of quiet."'

Meanwhile Malaysia's prime minister has also called on Ukrainian and pro-Russian separatists to agree to a ceasefire as he met his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte.

Najib Razak was in The Hague to discuss repatriating Malaysian victims of the crash and the security situation in Ukraine.

'We ask there be an immediate cessation of hostilities in and around the crash site by both Ukrainian and separatist forces,' Mr Razak said.

We ask that all sides respect the lives lost and the integrity of the crash site so that the investigation may proceed.'

The Malaysian Prime Minister met with his Dutch counterpart in The Hague today and called for a ceasefire so victims of the crash can be repatriated

Mr Razak also signed a book of condolence and later will visit Hilversum Centre where the remains of more than 200 victims are being held

All 298 passengers and crew aboard Flight 17 were killed, including 43 Malaysians and 195 Dutch nationals.

Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said around 80 bodies have yet to be recovered from the wreckage.

The remains of more than 200 victims that have been recovered and brought to the Netherlands are being painstakingly identified at a military base in Hilversum, a process expected to take weeks or months.

Mr Razak also signed a condolence register for victims and will visit the Hilversum Centre later today.
