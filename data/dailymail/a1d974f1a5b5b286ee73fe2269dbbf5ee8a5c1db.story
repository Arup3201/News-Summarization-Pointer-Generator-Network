EU judges have ruled Swiss chocolate-makers Lindt & Spruengli cannot trademark its world famous golden rabbit. 

The firm, which has been producing the treats since 1952 and claims to sell around 60 million a year, had hoped to stop Austrian rival Hauswirth from producing an almost identical-looking product.

But the Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the decision of the EU trademarks agency OHIM, which rejected Lindt's application for a trademark of its sitting bunny shapes wrapped in gold foil with a red ribbon bow tie.

The General Court, the EU's second-highest court had already said in 2010 that the decision of OHIM was correct, leading to Lindt's appeal before the ECJ.

'The Court confirms the reasoning of the General Court which found that Lindt had not proved that distinctive character had been acquired through use across the EU,'  the ECJ said in a statement.               

Lindt declined to comment on the ruling beyond saying it had not yet reviewed the judgment in full.

A spokeswoman said that its bunnies had been protected since 2000 because they carried a Lindt logo.           

Ruling: The Luxembourg-based European Union Court of Justice said Lindt had 'failed to establish the mark as a marque as an inherent distinctive character'

'We have built the trademark over about 20 years to make it a very strong brand, and this is the reason we want to protect it,' a spokeswoman for Lindt said.    

The row began in 2004 when Lindt told Hauswirth, which has been producing bunnies for 50 years, that they must switch to using bronze foil wrapping and a green bow.

Hauswirth refused but initially lost in court and were ordered to halt selling the bunnies until the matter had been fully resolved. 

In March, an Austrian court ruled that family-owned rival Hauswirth could no longer produce Easter bunnies that look like those made by Lindt.     

Hauswirth declined to comment on Thursday's European court ruling.
