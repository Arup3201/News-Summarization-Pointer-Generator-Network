By showing a different side to her character, Samia has even become unpopular with her fans

Fourteen years ago this week, fresh-faced 17-year-old Samia Ghadie made her Coronation Street debut as pretty kennelmaid Maria Sutherland.

Since then she's taken centre stage in some of the show's most harrowing storylines: who can forget her heartbreaking stillbirth, or when she was widowed after just eight months of marriage?

But for Samia things could have turned out very differently. Years earlier she was turned down for another part - the daughter of Des Barnes's girlfriend - when she was 11. 'Emily Aston, the sister of Sam, who plays Chesney, got it because she had ginger hair,' says Samia, 31.

'I remember crying on the sofa, saying, "What's wrong with me?" But now I'm glad I didn't get it because Corrie is huge and it could have been a shock to the system at that age.'

Instead, child actor Samia - she started drama classes aged six - won roles in Children's Ward, Heartbeat and Doctors, before heading back to Weatherfield. 'At 17, having done other shows, I felt ready for it,' she says.

One of Samia's disappointed rivals for the role was Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh. 'We've laughed about it since,' says Samia. 'And Kimberley's done amazingly with Girls Aloud, so I'm sure she doesn't mind she's not playing Maria. I definitely wouldn't want to swap with her - I love my life. And anyway, I can't sing!'

Samia's enjoyed showing a different side to Maria recently - even if it's got her into trouble with fans. This week sees Maria's transformation from goody two-shoes to bad-girl complete as her bid to split up her ex Tyrone and Fiz ends in disaster.

'For once, I don't mind people slagging me off,' she laughs. 'On Twitter they all say how much Maria's annoying them! It's been nice getting a bad reaction.

'It's been challenging though, showing another side to her. After all the years of hurt it has to explode some time. She's been pretty sane, even with her husband Liam being murdered. But her boyfriend Marcus being gay and cheating on her with Todd really drove her over the edge. Thankfully my life's more settled than Maria's.'

Samia describes her outfit a her first Bafta's appearance as her most embarrassing moment

Samia lives in Cheshire with hunky French ice skater Sylvain Longchambon, 33 - who she partnered on last year's Dancing On Ice - and her four-year-old daughter Freya by her property developer ex-husband Matthew Smith, who she divorced in 2011.

Samia says, 'I have a really good family behind me. Mum's great and picks Freya up from school if needed, and Matthew is just around the corner, so he helps a lot, as does Sylvain.'

Samia remains coy about their future plans, and when asked if she fancies getting married again she'll say only, 'I'm really happy as I am now.' Perhaps, given Maria's dreadful record with men, Samia's right to keep things the way they are.Â 

Cats or dogs? I love walking my dog, Sonny. He's a Maltese and is becoming a celebrity because I keep getting photographed with him!

Holiday- sun or snow? The sun, as we don't get a lot of it in Manchester!

Food- Middle Eastern or Asian? Lebanese. I grew up with it because my dad was Lebanese.

British or American TV shows? I'm working my way through the box set of US series Californication, starring David Duchovny. It's rude but funny.

Grease or Dirty Dancing? Dirty Dancing. Me and Sylvain always do 'the lift' when we've had a few drinks.

Pop or rock? Pop. I like all sorts - from enya to Lady Gaga. My current favourite song is Hideaway by Kiesza. It's a great summer tune.
