An Oklahoma school district has canceled all classes after a kindergartner died of a mysterious illness after she was sent home with a fever. 

The sudden death Monday night of six-year-old Jenny Yang from Oologah-Talala Lower Elementary School in Oklahoma caused panic among parents and students.

More than half of pupils didn't show up for class on Wednesday after parents were informed about Jenny's death. By Wednesday night, the superintendent had canceled school on Thursday.

It is not yet know what caused Jenny's death. The medical examiner says results of an autopsy are pending a toxicology report. 

Jenny Yang, 6, died shortly after she was sent home from school in Oklahoma with a fever

According to a GoFundMe page set up by her brother, Jenny was found unresponsive Monday night after she went to sleep on a couch after being sent home from school.

An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 

Her parents, who are immigrants who came to the US in 2005, were traveling at the time of her death and were not home. She was one of seven children.

Her uncle Xiong Yang told KOKI-TV: 'She’s never been sick. She’s such an outgoing child. One day she’s here and the next day she’s not here anymore.'

Her cause of death is not yet known and medical examiners are waiting on test results before they can figure out how she died so suddenly

It's unknown whether Janny had a communicable disease that caused her death.

In September and October more than 1,100 people - many of them young school children - fell ill with contagious enterovirus and several died suddenly from the respiratory infection and polio-like symptoms. 

School superintendent Max Tanner says the district has been following the advice of the county and state health departments. 

A GoFundMe page established to pay for Jenny's funeral has raised more than $7,100 for the family in just a few days.
