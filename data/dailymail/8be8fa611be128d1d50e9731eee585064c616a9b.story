A 22-year-old woman was last night charged with encouraging terrorism on Twitter.

Alaa Abdullah Esayed, from Kennington, south London, used the social network to post messages that would 'induce' others to 'commit acts of terrorism', the Metropolitan Police said.

She is also accused of using the site to share photographs, videos and links to terrorist speeches and propaganda.

Esayed was released on bail and will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on December 10.

]She has been charged with two offences under the Terrorism Act: encouraging terrorism, and the dissemination of terrorist publications. She was originally arrested in June.

It is alleged that between June 2013 and May 2014, 'she intended, or was reckless as to whether, members of the public would be directly or indirectly encouraged or otherwise induced by the statement to commit, prepare or instigate acts of terrorism or convention offences'.

She is also charged with providing a service that enabled others 'to obtain, read, listen to or look at a terrorist publication, by providing links to speeches and other propaganda, and at the time of doing so intended an effect of her conduct to be a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism'.

The charges come just days after sweeping new anti-terror laws were published by the Government.

A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including orders to block suspected British jihadists from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament.

It came just 24 hours after an official report into the May 2013 murder of Fusilier Rigby revealed a series of missed opportunities by the security services to prevent the attack.

The new counter-terror legislation will hand police powers to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists.

The long-awaited report into Fusilier Rigby's killing slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks.
