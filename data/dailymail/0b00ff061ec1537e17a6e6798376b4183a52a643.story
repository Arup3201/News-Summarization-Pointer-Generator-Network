A woman who has suffered two ectopic pregnancies and six miscarriages is asking strangers to help her become a mother - through a crowdfunding  website.

Jo Hilton, 34, has suffered fertility problems for more than 15 years after she was forced to terminate her first ectopic pregnancy when she was just 19.

After more than a decade of crippling period pains and countless operations she had a hysterectomy at just 31, ending her dreams of being a mother naturally.

Jo has now set up a crowd funding webpage, asking strangers to help her become a mother by raising £15,000 to fund insemination of a surrogate

So Jo and husband James, 36, have pinned their last hopes on an online fundraising website to raise £15,000 to fund the insemination of a surrogate.

Jo, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warks., said: 'We are doing everything we can to try and raise funds and we wish we didn’t have to ask for help.

'But it would mean so much for us to become parents - more than anything in the world - and we didn’t know what else to do.

'My life dream is us walking into a nursery in our home and watching our little baby peacefully sleep in their crib.

'It would mean everything - more than winning the lottery many times over and everything else in the world rolled into one.'

Jo suffered her first ectopic pregnancy after getting pregnant with her now ex-husband despite being on the pill.

Over the next six years she she fell pregnant a further six times - each ending in either miscarriages or terminations because they were growing outside of the womb.

She said: 'We just couldn’t hope - there was no hope left.

'We pretty much knew that everytime I got pregnant we knew how it was going to end.

'I would hope, but I would always know the outcome.'

The constant trauma created huge adhesions on her bladder, womb and ovaries, causing near-constant crippling pain and permanent damage.

The heartache put enormous strain on her relationship with her husband, and the pair split in February 2005. But just five months later Jo met the love of her life, James, on a dating website.

The couple fell madly in love and were married two years later in July 2007.

Jo told James about her fertility problems when they met, but the besotted couple tried for a baby with supportive James promising they would face it together.

Jo and James married in 2007 and decided to try for a baby together. Tragically in September 2008 Jo suffered her sixth and final miscarriage

But in September 2008 Jo suffered her sixth and final miscarriage.

Constant pain, coupled with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, saw Jo make the heartbreaking decision to have a hysterectomy, aged 31.

She said: 'It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make and I still question whether I made the right one.

'But I really had to make a decision about my health that was best for me, so I had to go ahead with it.

'A few days before I had it I was in a store doing some shopping and I found myself in the baby section.

'I was looking at the cribs and cradles and there I was surrounded by pregnant women all around me.

'I just froze and cried. James had to take me back to the car. I just couldn’t deal with that reminder of something I would never have for myself.'

Knowing they could never have their own child, the couple began to look at surrogacy.

Two friends offered to be surrogates, but one became pregnant herself and the other changed her mind.

They
looked into fostering and adoption, but Jo was rejected because she was
on morphine-based medication for pain condition fibromyalgia.

Jo, who is withdrawing her medication with the help of her doctor, launched their crowdfunding plea in October.

They need £15,000 to pay for a surrogate mum to be artificially inseminated with a donor egg fertilised by James’ sperm.

Friends and strangers have so far helped the couple raise £529.

Jo
is selling handmade jewellery to help raise cash, and talented painter 
James, who is a full-time carer for his wife, is selling artwork.

Constant pain, coupled with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, saw Jo make the heartbreaking decision to have a hysterectomy, aged 31. The couple now hope to raise money for a surrogate

Jo added: 'If people can empathise with our plight and can understand what it is like to go through infertility of any kind then please consider donating to our cause.

'You can donate as much or as little as you want to.

'If you can not understand infertility or what we are going through, then look at the faces of your children and wonder what your lives would be like without them smiling back at them - then you will have some idea.'
