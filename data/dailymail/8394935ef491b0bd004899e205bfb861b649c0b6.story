Casey Batchelor, who shot to fame on Celebrity Big Brother, has revealed how she lost more than a stone in just four weeks after being the target of online bullies.

The model banished her 'wobbly bits' for good and slimmed down from 9st 2lb to her ideal weight of 8st after Twitter users said she was 'chubby' following her stint on the Channel 4 reality TV show.

And it wasn't just her weight that plummeted - her breasts got smaller, too, going down from 32GG to a 32FF.

New body: Casey Batchelor, who shot to fame on Celebrity Big Brother, has slimmed down from 9st 2lb to her ideal weight of 8st after Twitter users said she was 'chubby'

Results: Casey lost more than 3lb a week during a punishing month of training using Guildford's fitness programme

Now Casey has the super-sculpted stomach of her dreams as she prepares for her 30th birthday.

Speaking about her weightloss, Casey said: 'I'm so proud of my tummy - Jessica Ennis, eat your heart out!

'I did so much work and have got in the best shape of my life. I felt I needed to go the extra mile with my 30th coming up in October.

'I'm going to be in my bikini for most of the summer and I was fed up with cruel comments on Twitter about how I looked chubby and overweight. No one can say that now.

'I’m so much more toned - I’ve got rid of all my puppy fat.'

Ready to party: Casey worked out and followed a rigorous exercise regime to shift the pounds in time for her 30th birthday

Casey's weight problems started earlier this year when she starred in Celebrity Big Brother and put on almost a stone lounging around the house.

She confessed: 'I hated the way I looked when I came out. If I put on weight, it shows - I had a puffiness around my face.

'I didn't feel good about myself and couldn't wear the kind of clothes that really show off my figure to its best effect. You could see my wobbly bits in the pictures - who wants big love handles hanging over their trousers?'

Casey finally knuckled down with the help of fitness trainer Ian Guildford - the man behind Luisa Zissman's bikini body.

The star said a key factor in her success was Forza Supplements' Raspberry K2 diet capsules.

She explained: 'I would take one just before I exercised every day. They gave me a little energy lift. They are also great for suppressing your appetite at weak moments.

'I'm a big fan of Oreos and I would always take one Raspberry K2 just when I was reaching for the cookie jar, and the urge to snack would go away.'

Determined Casey lost more than 3lb a week during a punishing month of training using Guildford's fitness programme.

Looking for love: Casey is now on the hunt for a man and says she's been single for five years now

She said: 'It was incredibly tough - I had 15 different exercises which I'd do for a minute each. I paid particularly attention to my stomach.

'I did a lot of leg raising exercises while in the C-position - that is sitting on your bottom with your body in the shape of a C.'

Casey completely changed her diet, too. She said: 'I was a sucker for carbs before, but they all went - bread and my favourite pasta. Instead, I ate lots of fresh fish and salads.'

Now, as her 30th approaches, Casey has the body of her dreams - except for her breasts.

'I would like to have a lift,' she explained. 'I don't want my boobs to be dangling around my ankles when I get in my 40s!'

Casey has real body confidence as she prepares to shoot her new calendar. Just one thing would complete her happiness - a man.

Casey, who has been previously linked to Will.i.a.m, insists that she has been single for the last five years.

She
 said: 'Don't get me wrong, I've dated in that time, but I've not been 
in a serious relationship for five years. It's about time that changed.'

She's already flaunting it! Casey is so proud of her new figure, she was keen to showcase it as she posed for photographers at the Malibu Airways: Pina Colada National Day pre-party at the Disco club in Soho
