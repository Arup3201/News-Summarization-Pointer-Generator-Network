Two nurses have filed a $200,000 civil lawsuit against the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy after he allegedly assaulted them while trying to take his newborn son out of the maternity ward.

The lawsuit comes just one week after the criminal charges against Kennedy were dropped, yet the nurses are still accusing him of negligence, assault and battery, as well as causing them emotional and physical distress.

The incident at the heart of the legal dramas is when Kennedy tried in January to take his newborn son from Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, saying he just wanted the two-day-old boy, Anthony Boru Kennedy, to get some fresh air.

Several nurses objected, saying his request would violate hospital policy which prevents people from taking newborns out of the maternity ward for fear of kidnapping or infection. Kennedy tried to leave anyway, and two nurses claimed he hurt them as they blocked his way.

The Journal News says the lawsuit was filed by nurses Anna Lane and Cari Luciano on Tuesday, a week after Kennedy was acquitted of child endangerment and harassment charges. Both testified during the criminal proceedings.

The newspaper said Kennedy vowed to fight the lawsuit and called it an attempt to extort money from his family.

The lawsuit comes as little shock, as Kennedy's lawyer Robert Gottlieb said that the nurses had been told that any potential lawsuit for damages would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first.

Violence: One of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by Kennedy at the hospital elevator

Clearly that did not happen, as the Mount Kisco Town Judge John Donohue, who heard the case without a jury, ruled that Kennedy broke no laws.

Judge Donohue said testimony showed the baby was not in danger except from the nurses' actions.

Gottlieb said after the decision, 'Given the barrage of public attention, it took a great deal of courage from this judge and we really do appreciate it.'

The hospital confrontation resulted in a series of alarms, including a 'code pink,' which is used to signal a baby's abduction. In his closing argument, Gottlieb called the alarm 'preposterous.'

He said the nurses overreacted to 
Kennedy's request and when they realized the hospital would investigate,
they 'join together, get their stories straight and pressure the 
district attorney's office to bring charges.'

Lane testified that Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to block him from going through a door to a stairwell. Luciano said Kennedy kicked her as she reached for the baby in Kennedy's arms.

Gottlieb said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby.

Kennedy also fell when that happened but kept hold of the baby. Prosecutors said his actions endangered the infant.

'The fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle,' Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto said.

She said Kennedy 'resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request.'

Kennedy's wife, Molly, accompanied him to the trial.

A state investigation, including a visit to the Kennedy home in Chappaqua, found no evidence of child abuse.

Kennedy, 45, is the 10th of 11 children of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. His father was assassinated in 1968. President John F. Kennedy, his uncle, was assassinated in 1963.

It has been a difficult year for the family as Douglas Kennedy's sister-in-law, Mary Kennedy, hanged herself in May in Bedford. His sister, Kerry Kennedy, has pleaded not guilty to drug-impaired driving after an accident on Interstate 684.
