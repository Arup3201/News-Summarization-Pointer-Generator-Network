A new first-time buyers’ Isa will mean those saving for a deposit will get £50 from the Government for every £200 they put away.

The Help to Buy Isa was unveiled by the Chancellor yesterday as a way to help thousands of young people on to the property ladder.

Set to be launched by banks and building societies this Autumn, it will give a maximum bonus per saver of up to £3,000. This means that a young couple who jointly save £24,000 could get £6,000 from the Government.

George Osborne announced a new first-time buyers Isa for those saving for a deposit and looking to get onto the property ladder. It will give them £50 from the Government for every £200 they put away

Groups of friends who buy together would also be able to take out one Isa each and get additional bonuses.

The scheme was hailed as a massive boost for first-time buyers, amid claims it could cut the average time taken to save for a deposit by up to a year.

David Hollingworth, director at brokers London & Country, said: ‘This is basically free money.

‘It will help combat the issue which really affects first-time buyers who complain that they cannot save as quick as house prices are rising.

‘It is quite a large perk the Government is paying.’

The average UK first-time buyer currently pays around £150,000 for a home, putting down an average deposit of £25,000, according to figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

In London, the typical price paid for a first home is £260,000. Last year around 25,000 first-time buyers a month made it on to the property ladder, with an average income of £38,000.

However, steep rises in house prices around the country – particularly in London and the South East – mean that it is becoming increasingly difficult for many to save the deposit needed.

The Government already has a number of initiatives aimed at those trying to buy their first property.

The original Help to Buy scheme, which has proved extremely popular, allows people to buy a home worth up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit.

The Government provides them with a loan – which is initially interest-free – to make up the rest of the down payment.

Around 45,000 buyers have benefited from the scheme so far.

The new Isa is the latest attempt by the Government to help first-time buyers.

The accounts will work like a traditional Isa, with interest paid out by banks and building societies tax-free.

They will be available to new account-holders for four years – but once opened there is no limit on how long someone can save for.

Savers can make an initial deposit of £1,000 when they open the Isa, but after this can only pay in a maximum of £200 a month.

A £50 bonus is then added by the Treasury. The minimum bonus size is £400, and the maximum is £3,000 – which would be payable on a balance of £12,000.

The bonus is only paid out when someone buys their first home, and only applies to properties worth up to £450,000 in London and £250,000 elsewhere in the UK.

Savers must be 16 or over to open a Help to Buy Isa.

They are individual accounts, meaning a group of four friends buying a home together could benefit from a total of £12,000 in Government bonuses.

Official figures suggest around £2billion could be paid out in bonuses between now and 2020.

Britain’s biggest bank, Lloyds Banking Group, estimated the bonus payouts could slash the average time it takes a first-time buyer to save a 5 per cent deposit from 37 months to 27. Stephen Noakes, the bank’s managing director of retail products, said: ‘We believe this provides a genuine solution to the challenge of raising a deposit. We know that this is the key barrier when trying to buy a first home.

‘This rewards positive savings behaviour and makes a real difference in helping young people get on to the property ladder faster.’ 

'Thrilled': David and Laura Picken want to buy their first home and start a family so the Government's new Help To Buy Isa will help them get on the property ladder

Young couple Laura and David Picken are renting a home while they save for a deposit, and were ‘thrilled’ to hear of the Government’s Help To Buy Isa.

The new measure, designed to help first-time buyers, will see the Government contribute £50 for every £200 saved.

The pair are currently paying £570 a month in rent on a three-bedroom terraced house in Liverpool, but would like to buy a home of their own with a garden so they can start a family.

Mrs Picken, 27, takes home £28,000 a year as a violinist while her husband, 26, works in hospitality earning £11,000.

They have so far managed to save £2,000 towards a house deposit in Isas with the Royal Bank of Scotland at an interest rate of 0.5 per cent.

As Mrs Picken is self-employed, her income varies from month to month and she finds it difficult to put money aside regularly. She hopes the Help to Buy Isa will speed up the couple’s saving.

The maximum Government bonus is £3,000 per person, so they could get £6,000 between them from the State.

Mrs Picken said: ‘This Help To Buy Isa is going to make a huge difference to us because we’ll be able to save up and get on the property ladder faster.

‘The significance of something like this is monumental for us because it could halve the time it takes us to put enough aside for a deposit. This will speed up our lives, it’s absolutely brilliant and I’m thrilled.’
