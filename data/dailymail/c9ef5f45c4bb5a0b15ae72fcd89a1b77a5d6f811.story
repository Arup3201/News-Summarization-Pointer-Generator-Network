Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made another statement against her son Jeb's possible 2016 presidential run saying that there have to be more politically-involved families in America hoping for time in the White House.

'I think this is a great American country, a great country, and if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,' she said in a new interview.

'I think the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes- there are just more families than that.'

Twice is enough: Barbara Bush said that should her younger son Jeb decide to run for president in 2016, that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the White House

The 88-year-old matriarch has made the same statement previously, and she stuck to her beliefs in the latest interview with C-SPAN but added a big compliment to her younger son.

'I would hope that someone else would run although there's no question in my mind that Jeb is the best qualified person to run for president,' she said.

'But I hope he won't because I think he'll get all of my enemies, all his brother's, all... and there are other families. I refuse to accept that this great country isn't raising other wonderful people.'

She said that she wasn't 'arrogant enough' to think that she was part of the only family in America to raise children ready for the White House.

Waiting in the wings: Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, is seen as a leading Republican candidate for 2016 and could make him the next Republican leader after his brother left office (seen at a 2004 rally for former President George W Bush's re-election)

Political families: Though they are both potential front runners for their respective parties, Hillary Clinton and Bush appeared at the same event at the National Constitution Center in September

The interview appeared to be filmed in her home as there were framed family pictures on the table beside her, including one of her granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager at her wedding and two other pictures of subsets of the Bush family posed in front of Christmas trees.

She also gave several of her grandchildren shout outs in the interview, praising their different ways of helping the world without going into politics.

'We're raising public servants, whether they're feeding the poor like Lauren is- who's fed 68 million children around the world- or Barbara who's bringing global health to the world or Pierce who's working for Big Brothers Big Sisters,' she said.

'There are a lot of ways to serve and being president is not the only one.'

Skilled: Mrs Bush, seen here with her husband and Jeb in 2002 when he was running for re-election as the Governor of Florida, said that she has no doubt that he is the best qualified person for the job

In spite of his motherâ€™s vocal disapproval, Jeb Bush is still considered one of the leading candidates in the Republican field for the 2016 race.

A Public Policy poll released today that examined potential candidateâ€™s standings in the primary battleground state of New Hampshire had the former Florida governor tied with Rand Paul for 12 per cent each and trailing Chris Christie who held on to 24 per cent of the votes in spite of the George Washington Bridge scandal.

Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker all followed. 

The field is quite a bit more narrow for the Democrats, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the first pick for 57 per cent, followed by Vice President Biden with 10 per cent and Elizabeth Warren with 8 per cent.
