A Portugal side missing Cristiano Ronaldo were shocked 2-0 by African islanders Cape Verde in Estoril.

The Ballon d'Or winner was released from international duty ahead of this friendly meeting at the Estadio Antonio Coimbra da Mota and Portugal dearly missed his guile and killer instinct.

Odair Fortes and Gege scored the Blue Sharks' goals before half-time and the dismissal of Portugal defender Andre Pinto on the hour mark made a comeback even more unlikely. It would not materialise.

It was the first time since 1986 that Portugal had lost to an African nation, though it shouldn't come as too much a surprise with Cape Verde up at 37 in the FIFA world rankings, above the likes of Scotland and Sweden.

Cape Verde made a lively start but the European side began to stamp their mark on proceedings soon after Vozinha was called into action on a number of occasions in goal, keeping out Vierinha and then Bernardo Silva.

But the visitors were in front in the 38th minute, as  Fortes' cross-cum-shot looped over Lopes at the far post.

Five minutes later they doubled their advantage after Heldon's free-kick fell kindly for Gege, who made his way up from defence and could hardly miss.

Hugo Almeida spurned a golden chance in the second half as Fernando Santos' side tried to rally, but Portugal's hopes of mounting a comeback were dealt a major blow on the hour mark when Pinto was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Heldon.

Pinto's sending off did not affect Portugal's attacking ambition, but their efforts ultimately proved fruitless on a famous night for Cape Verde.
