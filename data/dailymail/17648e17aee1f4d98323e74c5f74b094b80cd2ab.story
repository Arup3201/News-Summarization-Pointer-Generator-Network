Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell has been accused of 'cashing in' by accepting the job of chairman of Frontier Economics, which has been working on Heathrow Airport's third runway bid

Former Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell has been accused of ‘cashing in’ on his Government connections by accepting a top role with a private consultancy.

Critics say there is a conflict of interest in his new job as chairman of Frontier Economics, which has been working on Heathrow Airport’s third runway bid.

The leading financial consultancy lobbies ministers on behalf of its high-profile clients, mainly blue chip companies.

Lord O’Donnell, who received a peerage when his reign as Britain’s top civil servant ended, takes over from former Downing Street policy advisor Sarah Hogg, who is stepping down after 14 years at the company.

It comes at a crucial time for the controversial third runway bid, for which the firm has highlighted the potential economic benefits.

A report published by Frontier this month says the UK could miss out on £14billion of trade in the next decade without it.

Steve Reed, a Labour member of the House of Commons public administrations select committee, said: ‘There are far too many cases of civil servants taking well-paid jobs in the private sector so they can cash in on their contacts in government.’

During his time as Cabinet Secretary, between 2005 and 2011, Lord O’Donnell presided over a large increase in the number of consultants employed by Whitehall departments.

He joined Frontier in 2012 as a senior advisor and was promoted yesterday to chairman.

A spokesman for Frontier said he had not been involved in its work with Heathrow, and said: ‘Gus acts in full accordance with the Civil Service rules and his primary focus is to work with the team at Frontier to build the company into an even stronger European economics advisory business.’

Lord O’Donnell, an economist, said he was looking forward to his new role, saying: ‘Not only is Frontier at the forefront of applying economics to tough public and private sector issues, it has an internal culture that is second to none.’

Non-executive board members include Lord Turnbull, Lord O’Donnell’s predecessor as Cabinet Secretary.
