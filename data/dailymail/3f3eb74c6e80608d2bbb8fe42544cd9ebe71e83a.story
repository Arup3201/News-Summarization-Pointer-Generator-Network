Police have known for almost ten years that News of the World reporters hacked into Milly Dowler's phone, it emerged yesterday.

The paper admitted to the Surrey force within a month of her disappearance that they had illegally intercepted the 13-year-old's voicemail messages.

They claimed to have obtained her mobile number and PIN details from her schoolfriends.

But despite the journalists' admission of criminal activity in April 2002, no action was taken against them.

An individual from the newspaper 
admitted to police in April 2002 that they had accessed the 
voicemail of Milly Dowler, according to the Surrey force

Instead, the force invited two 
journalists from the now-defunct Sunday paper to a private meeting at 
the force's headquarters to discuss the case.

Officers had been told that the 
newspaper was planning to run a story claiming Milly had run away from 
home and had allegedly contacted a Midlands recruitment agency. In fact,
the agency had simply dialled a wrong number and left a message on 
Milly's mobile phone by mistake.

News that Surrey police had sat on 
evidence of hacking by the NoW since 2002 was revealed in a letter sent 
by the force to the Culture, Media and Sport committee.

MPs described the revelations as 
'sickening' and said the force faced 'serious questions' over what it 
knew. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee said: 
'Had they acted in 2002 ... it may have prevented the culture of hacking
becoming endemic at News of the World.'

The letter from the police describes 
discussions between the force and the newspaper over the story claiming 
Milly had run away from home and was seeking work.

The 16-page document – with key police
and journalists' identities redacted – does not address the crucial 
question of who deleted Milly's voicemails and gave her parents false 
hope that she might still be alive. Last month it emerged the messages 
may have been erased automatically by her mobile phone provider.

The police letter reveals that on 
April 13 2002, the Surrey force was told that a recruitment agency had 
received two phone calls from a woman claiming to be Milly's mother, 
Sally, asking if her daughter was working for them.

Culture Committee chairman John Whittingdale (left) said the letter appeared to show that several NotW journalists were involved in hacking the teenager's voicemails. Keith Vaz (right), chairman of the Home Affairs Committee said: 'The information provided by Surrey Police raises serious questions over what they knew about phone hacking and when'

Staff at the agency had turned up to 
find 'hordes of reporters from the News of the World waiting for their 
arrival as they had been given the same info'.

The agency said a NoW 
reporter claimed he was 'working in full co-operation with the police.' 
The force document explains that a voicemail message had been mistakenly
left on Milly's phone by the agency.

But by 'a pure coincidence' it was
not a message for Amanda – Milly's real name – but for a Ghanaian 
called Nana.

That message was accessed by the News 
of the World, which became '110 per cent' sure that Milly had run away 
from home and was looking for work.

Throughout April 13 2002, the 
newspaper spoke to detectives and press officers from Surrey police 
making it clear they had a recording of the voicemail message.

The newspaper said there were other 
voicemail messages from 'a tearful relative, a young boy, and someone 
saying “It's America, take it or leave it”.'

Desperate search: Emergency services all joined the hunt for Milly Dowler after her disappearance

On April 20, the News of the World 
played Surrey police the message left by the recruitment agency on 
Milly's phone and three months later, two of the newspaper's journalists
met senior officers at Surrey police HQ.

John Whittingdale, chairman of
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the police letter 
suggested that several NoW journalists were involved in hacking Milly's 
voicemails.

Tory MP Damian Collins added: 'Of all 
of the documents and evidence that have been produced by our 
phone-hacking inquiry, this is the most sickening and exposes the black 
hearts of those involved in perpetrating and covering up this scandal.'

Last night a statement from the Dowler
family said: 'The release of the Surrey police statement is a further 
reminder of the relationship between that force and the News of the 
World.

'The report indicates that the police force were aware of a caller
purporting to be Sally Dowler seeking information in 2002.

'No doubt 
there will be current investigations as to who that was as it was not 
Sally Dowler. Surrey Police have not explained why they did not 
investigate that deception in 2002.'
