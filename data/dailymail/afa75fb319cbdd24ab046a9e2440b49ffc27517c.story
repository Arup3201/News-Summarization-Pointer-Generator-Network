Puffins are well-known for their clown-like facial markings and pleasant demeanor.

But for one unlucky bird being caught by this huge falcon was no laughing matter as it quickly became lunch.

The series of pictures documenting the puffin's final moments was taken by Audun Dahl at Hornxya, Varanger, in Northern Norway.

Putting up a fight: Despite being less than half the falcon's size, the tiny puffin put up a brave fight

Predatory: The gyrfalcon feeds mostly on other birds, including puffins and gulls, but also small mammals

The 27-year-old photography guide from the island of Smola, Norway, runs a guiding company specialising in white-tailed eagles and hide photography.

Audun said: 'The falcon broke the Puffins neck in just a few seconds, it seemed for me, that the falcon had full control of the situation all the time.

'I was so excited when shooting this incredible sequence - I just thought to myself I must keep calm and keep the gyrfalcon in focus.

'When shooting nature, anything can happen, the fight is natural behavior, so I did not feel sorry for the puffin.

Final moments: Despite the struggles of its prey the falcon clings on with its powerful talons so there is no escape

No contest: Photographer Audun Dahl, from Norway, said the falcon was always in control

'This happens every day in these remote cliffs - but this is the first time I have seen it happen so close, and I was very lucky I was at the right place, at the right moment.'

The gyrfalcon is the largest of all falcon species, and it is also the only falcon to be a sea bird, spending as much as 40 days living on pack-ice and hunting gulls during the winter season.

It can be found throughout most of the northern hemisphere, from America to Asia and Europe, and varies in appearance from all-white to dark brown depending on location.

Lunch: The falcon flies off with its kill. The majestic bird was prized by the Vikings and is the symbol of Iceland

The birds were highly prized by the Vikings, and are thought to have been hunted and eaten for food, but also captured and kept as intimidating pets. The bird is also the national symbol of Iceland.

Its prey includes other birds, from puffins to geese and gulls, and also small mammals such as lemmings, hares and voles. The species has also been spotted eating carrion meat, though this is rare.

Meanwhile puffins are much smaller birds which usually nest in large colonies on cliff faces or in burrows, making them an ideal target for gyrfalcons which often perch in similar areas.

The birds are known for their clown-like facial markings and bright beaks, and feed on small fish which they catch by diving into the sea.
