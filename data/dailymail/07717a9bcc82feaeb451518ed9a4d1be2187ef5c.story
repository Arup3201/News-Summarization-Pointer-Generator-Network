In the dark: The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that photos of Mohammed al-Qahtani should remain classified in the interest of national security. Al-Qahtani is pictured here in this undated photo.

A federal appeals court on
Tuesday said that photos of a Saudi man accused of being the '20th hijacker' in the Sept. 11 attacks should remain classified to protect national security.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the
government plausibly showed that releasing images of Mohammed
al-Qahtani, who was subject to interrogation techniques that a
government official likened to torture, could endanger military
personnel, diplomats and workers in Afghanistan and elsewhere.

The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents
al-Qahtani in a federal lawsuit in Washington, D.C. over his
treatment, had sought the disclosure of photographs, videos and
other audiovisual evidence of his confinement conditions under
the federal Freedom of Information Act.

Writing for a three-judge panel, however, Circuit Judge Jos√©
Cabranes said the release 'could logically and plausibly harm
national security because these images are uniquely susceptible
to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite
violence against United States interests domestically and
abroad.'

Al-Qahtani has been held since February 2002 at the U.S.
prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

He had been the target of a 'special interrogation plan'
that included 20-hour interrogations, sleep deprivation,
prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, forced nudity,
performance of dog tricks while wearing a dog collar, and sexual
humiliation, according to publicly leaked interrogation logs.

Lawrence Lustberg, a lawyer representing the CCR, had no
immediate comment. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
in Manhattan declined to comment.

A top Bush administration official overseeing practices at
Guantanamo declined to recommend that al-Qahtani be prosecuted,
telling the Washington Post in 2009 that his treatment 'met the
legal definition of torture.' The case was dismissed without
prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again.

Classified: Photos from Mohammed al-Qahtani's confinement in Guantanamo Bay, the detention center pictured here in 2004, will remain classified

Nearly 3,000 people died in the Sept. 11 attacks.

Four planes were hijacked, with two crashing into the World
Trade Center in New York, a third into the Pentagon near
Washington, and a fourth in a western Pennsylvania field.

In 2005, the government said al-Qahtani intended to help
hijack the fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, but that
immigration officials denied him entry to the United States.
Flight 93 was the only plane with four hijackers, not five.

Tuesday's decision upheld a Sept. 2013 ruling by U.S.
District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan.
