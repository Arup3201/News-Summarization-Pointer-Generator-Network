Villagers in Cameroon are living in fear of Boko Haram militants who have been launching raids across the border from Nigera to snatch children, a report claims.

Hundreds of troops have been dispatched to the country's north, which shares a long border with Borno, the Nigerian state at the heart of the group's Islamist insurgency.

But despite the deployment of some of Cameroon's most-elite units, whole villages have been cleared out and schools torched by Boko Haram raids.

Villagers told Sky News correspondent Alex Crawford that Boko Haram fighters made daylight raids to snatch young boys to force them to take up arms as child soldiers.

One boy described how he was confronted by militants while out working in the fields. After he refused their invitation to join them the situation became tense but he was able to run away.

Cameroon shares a 1,243-mile border with Nigeria that is mostly unmanned. Nigeria has accused Cameroon of failing to stop Boko Haram using its territory as a safe haven.

But Cameroon's Defence Ministry spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Badjeck, rejected the claim.

'They are not in Cameroon. Why would we allow that? This is bad for Cameroon,' he told Sky New. 'We are suffering too at the hands of Boko Haram.'

Founded in 2002, Boko Haram was a more or less a peaceful political group that sought the establishement of an Islamic government in Borno state, an area ruled by the Islamic Bornu Empire before colonisation.

It turned to violence in the face of a Nigerian government crackdown in 2009 and, in April, soared to worldwide notoriety after kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, a town in Borno.

Hundreds have been killed in attacks by the group this year alone. On Tuesday, at least 14 people were killed in the bomb attack in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, which struck football fans watching the World Cup.

Witnesses said a tricycle taxi was driven into the outdoor area before the bomb went off.

Police said the death toll was 14, with 26 people wounded. One hospital worker told the BBC however that he had counted 21 bodies.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility but Boko Haram was suspected.

Police assistant superintendent Nathan Cheghan said rescue workers were being careful for fear of secondary explosions, often timed to kill people who rush to the scene of a bomb blast.

Last month an attack on a market place in the city of Jos, Plateau State, which used precisely that tactic to kill 118 in car-bomb blasts timed 30 minutes apart.

Other recent attacks include the slaughter of at least 200 civilians in three remote communities in Borno on June 2, a bombing at a football field in Mubi, Adamawa state, which killed at least 40, and attacks on the Borno towns of Gamboru and Ngala, in which as many as 336 are thought to have been killed.
