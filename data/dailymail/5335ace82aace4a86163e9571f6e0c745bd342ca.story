Just 50 pupils on free school  meals make it to Oxford or Cambridge each year – fewer than the number admitted from Eton.

Figures published for the first time reveal a stark divide in access to leading universities according to family and school background.

Fifty out of the nearly 30,000 pupils on free school meals due to low family income went to Oxford or Cambridge Universities in 2011 – the latest available figures – despite years of initiatives aimed at widening the mix of students.

Eton College in Berkshire, which was 
attended by the likes of David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson, 
produced 60 successful applicants in the same year. Westminster, where 
Nick Clegg was an old boy, produced 65.

The Department for Education breakdown showed how private school pupils were five times as likely to win places at Oxbridge as youngsters educated at state schools and colleges.

Despite billions of pounds being spent over the past 15 years on outreach schemes, bursaries and funding aimed at opening up access to university, just one in 100 state school pupils made it to one of Britain’s top two universities – against one in 20 from private schools.

And just one in ten state-educated teenagers went to a university in the elite 24-strong Russell Group – compared with nearly four in ten fee-paying pupils.

The figures show that 1,373 state schools and colleges out of 2,177 sent no pupils to Oxford or Cambridge, while 287 got none into a Russell Group university.

Five state secondaries failed to send a single sixth-former to  any university.

The breakdown, which relates to those who left school or college in 2011, shows that 38 per cent of pupils from private schools went straight to Russell Group universities at age 18 – compared with 11 per cent of their counterparts from the state school system.

The figures also show that areas which have retained grammar schools tended to send the most teenagers to the country’s top universities.

Pupils from Reading were 30 times more likely to attend a Russell Group university than those from Portsmouth.

Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘We are publishing this  data so people can see for themselves how different schools, colleges and local authorities perform. It is right that parents have as much information as possible on which to base decisions for their children’s education.

‘Some students will be aiming to get a job after college, others will be hoping to win a place at a great university. But all schools and colleges must ensure they deliver for all their students – whatever that student’s target.

‘Our reforms are working. More young people from disadvantaged areas in England are applying to university than ever before; more than 20 per cent in 2014, compared to less than 15 per cent in 2009.’
