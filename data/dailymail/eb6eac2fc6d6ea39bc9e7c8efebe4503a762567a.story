Robbed: Thomas Van Straubenzee was attacked while he spoke to Prince Harry on his mobile phone in Battersea, south London

A violent robber who mugged Prince Harry’s friend as he chatted with the prince on a mobile phone has been jailed.

Winful Taylor, 27, was on bail for an identical attack and wearing an electronic tag when he targeted Thomas van Straubenzee, 29, grabbing him by the throat, pushing him to the ground and threatening him with a knife.

He was jailed for two years but could be released in just nine months.

Harry listened in horror on the phone  as his old school friend was pinned down by Taylor and an unnamed accomplice.

They knelt on his neck and covered  his mouth before stealing two phones  and a wallet. The prince raced to the scene in Battersea, South London, with his protection officer and scoured the streets for his friend.

When he could not find him Harry  caused great surprise by turning up at the local police station.

There he found a shaken Mr van Straubenzee who had been taken  there by officers after a passerby contacted police.

Both the prince and Mr van Straubenzee gave statements.

It is thought to be the first time a senior member of the royal family has walked into a station to report an offence.

The attack, which happened on November 30 last year, sparked a security scare after it emerged that one of the phones contained telephone numbers of several members of the royal family.

Mr van Straubenzee is close friends with Prince William as well.

Mugging: Thomas van Straubenzee was walking past Battersea Park on his way home from work when he was set upon by Winful Taylor and an accomplice

Taylor was arrested at a bail hostel 
in Streatham two days later where he was found with the phone, which he 
had used just 80 minutes after the attack.

He denied a charge of robbery.

On the day he robbed Mr van Straubenzee, Taylor was on bail for an identical attack five weeks earlier.

He targeted social worker Andre Morris
in Hyde Park in London on October 25, choking and pinning him down as 
he tried to rob him. Mr Morris managed to escape and alert police.

Taylor was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to 18 months in prison in May.

The thug has an appalling record, with
convictions spanning almost a decade for assaulting a police officer, 
theft, burglary, robbery, damaging property, possession of heroin and 
crack cocaine and failing to surrender to custody.

He also has two previous convictions for robberies in July 2006.

Yesterday, at Kingston Crown Court, 
Judge Richard Southwell sentenced Taylor to two years in jail but he 
said this would run concurrently with the previous 18-month sentence.

This means he could walk free in just 
nine months as he will automatically be released at the halfway point 
and will receive credit for serving three months.

Mr van Straubenzee, a City 
stockbroker, has been friends with Prince Harry since their days at 
Ludgrove Prep School.

Mr van Straubenzee
was not in court to see the defendant sentenced.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
