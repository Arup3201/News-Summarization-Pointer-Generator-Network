A married couple in their 60s were found shot dead in their Orlando, Florida home and now local authorities are searching for their 30-year-old quadruple amputee son as a person of interest in their 'suspicious' deaths.

The bodies of Michael and Nancy Petrozzino, 63 and 64, were discovered Tuesday morning, after the principal at the elementary school where Mrs Petrozzino taught second grade called 911 when she didn't show up for work. 

Soon after making the gruesome discovery, the Orange County Sheriff's Office held a press conference, asking about the whereabouts of the couple's son Sean Petrozzino, 30.

Drove off? Police say Sean may be driving this red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY. Neighbors say it was Sean's father's car

Michael (left) and Nancy Petrozzino (right) were found dead in their Orange County, Florida home Tuesday morning 

They say he may be driving a red Toyota with a license plate number of 112VZY, which neighbors say is his father's car. 

Sean Petrozzino has not yet been named as a suspect in the case, but police have named him a person of interest and believe he is armed and dangerous and possibly headed to south Florida. 

Sean (right) reportedly moved back home with his parents last week after breaking up with his wife Cynthia (left) 

Sean and his great Dane moved back in with his parents last week after separating from his wife. The former couple's home in Georgia is allegedly in foreclosure.

Sean is also a quadruple amputee after a teenage bout with bacterial meningitis. In 2000, he underwent 13 surgeries to remove the infection which resulted in the loss of both his legs and he only has part of one hand left.  He is able to walk with the use of prosthetic limbs.

'I've known Sean since he was 16 years old,' mother in law Cathleen Horne told the Sentinel. 'This just seems bizarre. It seems like a bad dream.'

'We met Sean about a week-and-a-half ago,' neighbor Richard Ellwood told My Fox Orlando. 'He was introduced to me by Nancy as their son.'

Mr Ellwood went on to describe the couple as nice people who had lived in the neighborhood for several years. 

'It's difficult to imagine someone who would have that much rage, whoever did this,' he told WKMG. 

Before their deaths, Mr Petrozzino worked at Walt Disney World and his wife worked as a teacher at Andover Elementary School.  

Anyone with information about the son's whereabouts are being asked to call a Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS.

The Orlando Sentinel spoke to Jerry L. Saunders of ABC Prosthetics and Orthotics, who verified that handless people indeed have the ability to fire a weapon.

It's also known that Sean Petrozzino is able to manage other finer tasks such as using an ATM. 

Police verified this late Wednesday when they released surveillance footage of Petrozzino as he used an Orlando cash machine on Tuesday, most likely after his parents were slain.

What's more, police are searching for Petrozzino as he's thought to potentially be on his way to South Florida and behind the wheel of his father's red Toyota.
