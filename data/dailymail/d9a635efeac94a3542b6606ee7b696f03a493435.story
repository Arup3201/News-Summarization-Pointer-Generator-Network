Mario Gotze says he would be 'really happy' if Germany team-mate Marco Reus decided to join Bayern Munich from Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund.

Gotze moved to Bayern from Dortmund for £31.5million last summer, and the 2014 World Cup winner is keen for the man three years his senior to follow his lead.

Reus is being monitored by Europe's elite clubs and Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp may have a task on his hands to keep the 25-year-old attacking midfielder at the Westfalenstadion.

'I get along really great with Marco,' Gotze told German newspaper Bild. 'That's his decision, he must know himself. But I would be really happy if he would come here.'

Gotze's move from Dortmund to Bayern was controversial as it was announced on the eve of BVB's Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid.

The 22-year-old says he was not influenced in making the switch, and that is was his choice alone. 

'It's my life, it's my decision,' continued Gotze. 'I get advice, but the final decision about my life is one I always take alone. I have long agonised about it. It was a very, very important decision for me.

'I'm 22-years-old. I cannot do everything right, I need to have the scope to make errors. This is normal, as in real life.'
