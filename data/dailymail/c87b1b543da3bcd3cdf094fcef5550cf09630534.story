Angry residents in Charleston, West Virginia, have post disturbing photos online of the contaminated water flowing from their taps as they attempt to flush their pipes clean in the wake of last Thursday's chemical spill.

It is almost a week since more than 300,000 West Virginians were left without water after a storage facility leaked several thousand gallons of a coal-processing chemical located upstream from the town's water treatment plant.

While the water ban has now been partially lifted and some residents have been allowed to run their water in order to 'flush' the system, many are still waiting for officials to tell them their tap water is safe.

A number of local people have documented the effects of the chemical spill on the water coming out of their taps in a series of photographs which show discolored and oily water which some have described as smelling like antifreeze.

So far, about 40 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers have been allowed to use their water again after a chemical spilled into the Elk River on Thursday, state officials said on Tuesday night.

Customers are asked to flush out 
their systems before using the water again. Officials cautioned the 
water could still have an odor, but they claim it is safe.

More than 200 restaurants have reopened where the ban has been lifted, said Amy Shuler Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, and all hospitals but one had running water by Tuesday, Tomblin said. The exception was Boone Memorial Hospital in Madison, the governor said.

'Here's what the oily tap water looks like in West Virginia & smells like antifreeze strongly,' tweeted Maria Armada

There were still some areas on the edges 
of the water system with chemical levels exceeding the acceptable 
amount, said West Virginia National Guard Adjutant Gen. James A. Hoyer.

Schools in all four counties in the 
affected areas remain closed on Wednesday. Tomblin did not provide a 
timeline for when school will resume.

The emergency closed schools, restaurants and businesses because they, along with about 300,000 residents, were told not to drink, shower or even wash clothes with the contaminated water.

Matthew Davis said his neighborhood was still waiting for the ban to be lifted. After rinsing off at a nearby creek last week, he finally enjoyed a hot shower on Tuesday at his fiancee's house 30 minutes away.

Davis, 21, had his wisdom teeth removed just before the water ban. ‘Pretty much all I had was Coke, and that hurt,’ Davis said.

Officials cautioned that even water that was deemed safe may still have a slight licorice-type odor, raising the anxieties of some.

Beverly Farrow also took a shower for the first time on Tuesday morning after nearly five days without water. She got the call on Monday night from the water company saying it was OK to flush the water systems.

‘I thought, “Oh my gosh, here we go,” and all of the faucets went on. Of course, I have not brushed my teeth or rinsed my mouth with the water yet, I'm still kind of waiting on that.’

Bobbi Holland, another Edgewood resident, went to wash her face Monday night after flushing out her system.

‘It smelled stronger than ever and I was like, “Oh no,” but I thought, “I'm tired, I'm just going to bed.” But when I woke up this morning, there wasn't any odor,’ she said on Tuesday.

However one homeowner showed just how toxic and flammable the water still was on Sunday by setting on fire a glass poured from his kitchen tap.

West Virginia's top law enforcement officer on Wednesday vowed a full investigation of a chemical spill that contaminated tap water for hundreds of thousands of people.

Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said there was a lot of speculation surrounding the spill into the Elk River at Charleston, the state capital, on Thursday that shut off water to more than 300,000 people.

'We had an absolute unmitigated disaster here for six days now where people are without water. This is not only utterly unacceptable. It's outrageous on every level,' Morrisey told CNN.

He said that his investigation would be designed to ensure that another such spill never happened again, and local, state and federal officials all shared responsibility.

'We're going to look under the hood, we're going to uncover all the rocks and we're going to let the sunlight in,' Morrisey said.

Water distribution stations continued to hand out water and the water company said it could be days before the entire system is back. Officials lifted the ban in a strict, methodical manner to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed.

The water crisis started on Thursday when a chemical used in coal processing leaked from a Freedom Industries plant into the nearby Elk River.

Complaints came in to West Virginia American Water about an odor and officials discovered the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol was leaking out of a 40,000-gallon tank.

Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation.Only 14 people exposed to the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in serious condition.

The chemicals removed from Freedom Industries' Elk River site have been shipped to another facility that the company owns, said Jimmy Gianato, state Department of Homeland Security director.

The facility is in nearby Nitro, not near a water source, Gianato state officials said late on Tuesday.

Environmental activist Erin Brockovich came to Charleston after she said she received thousands of online requests to visit and look into the spill. Brockovich said she believes officers from the company responsible for the spill should face criminal charges.

‘It would've cost so much less to identify the leak, report the leak, fix the leak instead of ignore the leak. This is going to be hundreds of millions of dollars,’ she said.

During the water ban, some people had put plastic bags 
around faucets so that they will be reminded not to use the water while 
others left town to take a shower and find an open restaurant.

Water
 distribution centers handed out bottled water and trucks with large 
tanks of water filled up containers for people to take home.

So far, only ten people exposed to 
the contaminated water were admitted to the hospital, and none were in 
serious condition, Health and Human Resources Secretary Karen Bowling 
said.

The chemical, even in 
its most concentrated form, isn't deadly. However, people were told they
 shouldn't even wash their clothes in affected water, as the compound 
can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation and rashes to vomiting 
and diarrhea.
