Golf ace Rory McIIroy has put a very public dig from his former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki behind him to win one of sport's biggest prizes.

The Northern Irishman today won his first Open Championship at Hoylake in the Wirral.

Going into the final round he was in pole position with a six-shot lead over nearest rival Rickie Fowler - a margin no-one has ever blown  in the competition.

But while the runaway leader reaches new heights his  tennis star ex has been belittling the 5ft 8in star on Twitter by wearing a pair of high heels.

Champion: Rory McIlroy has won The Open Championship

Cheeky: Caroline Wozniacki posted this picture, saying she was wearing heels for the first time in three years

Last week the former world No 1 posted a picture of herself shopping with a friend in Istanbul where she is competing in the Istanbul Cup.

She is playing in the final there today meaning two months after the end of their engagement, she could also become a champion.

Wozniacki said: 'Out and about in Istanbul. It's been three years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood #looksgood #shopping #highheels #sun.

She later deleted the post on Instagram.

It didn't seem to bother McIlroy in his first round on Friday, as he hit a second consecutive 66 at The Open to go four clear before extending that lead yesterday.

Wozniacki, who dated McIlroy for three years, is  5ft 10in while the Northern Irishman is 5ft 8in.

Difference: Wozniacki was slightly taller than McIlroy in heels (left) and so often wore flat shoes (right)

Not used to heels? Shortly after the stiletto photo she posted this photo of herself and Marta pampering their feet and getting a pedicure - which she has not deleted

The couple off their engagement in May, just days after sending out their wedding invitations.

During Wimbledon, Wozniacki laughed off the idea that she might try internet dating as the Dane said she was not 'desperate' enough to try virtual apps such as Tinder.

McIlroy, meanwhile, was spotted in Dublin with model Nadia Forde earlier this month.

She isn't at Hoylake to cheer him on today, despite speculation that she might turn up. She is in Florida, where she is relaxing after her recent car crash.

Leading: McIlroy made a fine start to The Open and was seen with model Nadia Forde earlier this month
