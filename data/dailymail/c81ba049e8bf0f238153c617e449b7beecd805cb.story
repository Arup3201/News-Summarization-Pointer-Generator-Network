The grandparents of an 8-year-old Virginia girl took her out of the Christian school she'd been attending all year after they received a letter telling them that if she didn't stop dressing like a boy she would be refused enrollment for the next school year.

Rather than give the school the chance to humiliate their granddaughter, Sunnie Kahle's grandparents - and legal guardians - Doris and Carrol Thompson took her out of the Timberlake Christian School in Timberlake, Virginia, and are now sending her to public school.

Sunnie has short hair, likes sports and wears muddy sneakers when other girls her age might be wearing something more feminine.

Timberlake Christian School feels that Sunnie's appearance doesn't meet its 'biblical standards' for a young girl's appearance.

'You're probably aware that Timberlake Christian School is a 
religious, Bible believing institution providing education in a 
distinctly Christian environment,' the letter sent to the Thompsons - and shared with WSET - said. 

It goes on to say that other students are confused about whether Sunnie is a boy or a girl.

'Christian': The school sent the Thompsons a letter explaining that Sunnie's appearance didn't meet the school's 'biblical standards

Sad: Sunnie wants to go back to Timberlake because her friends are all there

In the letter, administrators remind the Thompsons that the school can refuse to admit a student if that student is 'condoning sexual immorality, practicing a homosexual 
lifestyle or alternative gender identity.'

It then goes on to cite specific Bible versus. 

'We believe that unless Sunnie as well as her family clearly understand 
that God has made her female and her dress and behavior need to follow 
suit with her God-ordained identity, that TCS is not the best place for 
her future education,' the letter from the school's principal, Becky Bowman stated.

'How do you label a child, eight years old, or discriminate against an 
eight year old child? It just don't happen,' Carroll Thompson told the station.

Dorris quotes Sunnie saying 'I'm a girl, I know I'm a girl' and says that if she wants to go out and 'play in the mud' that's fine with her.

Good student: The school even says that Sunnie is a good student, but her appearance is a 'distraction'

Identity: The school implied Sunnie is confused about her gender, but she says she knows she's a girl

However, Sunnie misses her friends at Timberlake Christian.

'She cries every morning to get on the bus, she cries when she comes
 home because she wants to go back to Timberlake Christian with her 
friends,' said Doris Thompson.

The school maintains that they have not accused Sunnie of 'being anything or anyone' and that the school is just asking that she follow guidelines set forth for every student.

The Thompsons, however, have no interest in re-enrolling their granddaughter at Timberlake Christian.
