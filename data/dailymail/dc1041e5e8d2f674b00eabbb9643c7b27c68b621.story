The Queen is living in ‘crumbling surroundings’ and faces a £50million repair bill to bring her palaces up to scratch, it emerged yesterday.

More than a third of the royal estate has been designated as below ‘target condition’.

National treasures such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle have walls riddled with asbestos, badly need rewiring and have leaking roofs.

Staff have to catch the rain in buckets to protect priceless works of art and antiques, particularly in the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace.

Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Alan Reid revealed that it will cost tens of millions to return royal residences to their former splendour.

Details of the Queen’s ‘penury’ emerged as her courtiers were accused by MPs of dragging their feet over a huge backlog of repairs.

Sir Alan, the Royal Family’s senior treasurer, was questioned by members of the Commons Public Accounts Committee after a National Audit Office report revealed the Queen will enjoy a 22 per cent increase in income over two years.

She is expected to be given £37.9million in 2014/15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31million in 2012/13.

But most of the state rooms used for 
entertaining foreign heads of state have not been decorated since the 
Queen came to the throne 60 years ago, while Princess Anne was almost 
hit by falling masonry as she got out of her car at Buckingham Palace 
just a few years ago.

Palace
officials blame the backlog on a ‘real terms’ squeeze of up to 60 per 
cent in funding by government over the past 20 years, forcing them to 
‘make do and mend’.

Windsor
Castle has had its lead roofs ‘patched up’ so many times that an area 
the size of both Centre and No1 courts at Wimbledon needs replacing.

MPs were ‘shocked at the complacency’ of the backlog, which means some buildings such as Victoria and Albert’s mausoleum at Windsor could be lost to the nation.

The ageing Royal Train is likely to be scrapped in the next five to ten years as the cost of replacing it would be ‘staggering’, aides admitted yesterday.

Despite now being used by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles barely a dozen times a year – at a cost of more than £25,000 per journey – palace officials have always insisted it was a necessary mode of travel.

Asked whether it was a ‘sensible’ option in the future or offered ‘effective value for money’, Sir Alan Reid admitted the train, built in the 1970s, ‘doesn’t have much life left in it’.

He even confessed it was ‘noisy, slow and uncomfortable’.

They also questioned why the Queen’s energy bills have soared by 50 per cent in a year to £3.1million, when money could have been saved if courtiers had had the ‘wit’ to fix their bills as millions of her subjects do.

Sir Alan yesterday blamed the high energy costs in part on ‘antiquated’ boilers which have not been replaced for 60 years.

Labour’s Austin Mitchell said: ‘I gather from the report that you’ve managed the finances by letting the buildings deteriorate, and freezing staff costs and by digging into the reserves. Work is being carried on while they are living in crumbling surroundings.’

Tory Richard Bacon said he had been told the Buckingham Palace wiring had not been done since 1949. ‘Everyone knows that the longer you leave something, the worse it gets and the greater the overall cost of maintenance and restoration in the longer term,’ he said.

Labour’s Fiona Mactaggart said: ‘I have to say I am rather shocked at the complacency, and what I want to know is what you have done to ensure that these buildings are secure for the nation.’

Sir Alan replied: ‘I would love to do the whole of the property backlog right away, but we have limited funds, there’s a head of state to support as well as buildings to maintain. We have to make priorities.’

He admitted that some 39 per cent of the royal estate was below ‘target condition’. The committee chairman, Labour’s Margaret Hodge, was dismayed when Sir Alan initially said he could not give the precise cost of repairs, a figure he later estimated to be around £50million.

After the hearing, Mrs Hodge said: ‘They’ve got to get a bit real. The rest of the world is coping, why can’t they? I was pretty shocked that they hadn’t got a clear view of what work needed to be done, what was the cost and where the priorities lay.

‘You don’t run national heritage assets that way, from hand to mouth. They can serve Her Majesty better.’

Sir
Alan told the committee they were hoping to make ‘major inroads’ over 
the next decade. As well as questioning the big increase in energy 
bills, MPs asked why the Royal Family’s gas use had soared by 14 per 
cent.

Sir Alan said that while the 
Household did not ‘fix’ its bill, it set up multi-year deals to obtain 
power from the wholesale markets.

Last
week’s NAO report highlighted previous ‘significant reductions’ in the 
monarchy’s funding. In order to cope the Queen’s money men have reduced 
net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms.

The
Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings – known as ‘drawing down on
reserves’ – over the years and is, apparently, down to her last 
£1million in the bank.
