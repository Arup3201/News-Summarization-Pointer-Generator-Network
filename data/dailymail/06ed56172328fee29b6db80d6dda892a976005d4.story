Fans have also posted illustrations on Twitter in reference to his other films.

An illustration of box holding the Jumanji board game - just as it appears in the 1995 children's film of the same name - was captioned with the words ''Robin Williams isn't dead, he's just stuck in the jungle waiting for someone to roll a 5 or 8' from @Dory.

In the movie, Williams' character was trapped in the Jumanji game for twenty-six years before he was released by a child who rolled one of the numbers.

Childhood memories: Comedian Bo Burnham shared this snap of him as a child dressed as Robin Williams' character from 'Aladdin'

Williams' 
likeness was depicted forming from smoke coming out of a genie 
bottle, in reference to his voice work as a genie in the Disney cartoon 'Aladdin.'

Comedian Bo Burnham proved himself a fan, by sharing online a photo of himself in a genie costume.

He captioned the photo, 'A picture of me wearing one of the many smiles Robin Williams has given me during my life.'

Twitter users have also shared stills of Williams from his film appearances, along with some of his more famous quotes.

Fans have also set up makeshift memorials across the country.

A bench in 
Boston's Public Garden - where Williams appeared in a scene for 'Good 
Will Hunting' with Matt Damon - has been covered with flowers, written 
tributes and at least one teddy bear.

Williams
 played a therapist who helps Damon's character deal with various 
personal and emotional issues. He won the Academy Award for Best 
Supporting Actor for his work in the 1997 film.

The concrete pathway next to the bench has also been covered in writings and quotes from Williams' movies.

Fans and onlookers were photographed leaving notes for Williams and taking pictures of the memorial.

On the West Coast, candles and flowers were left on the steps of the San Francisco home where Williams filmed 'Mrs. Doubtfire.'

'Robin, you'll be missed. You were loved xoxo,' a note written on a heart-shaped piece of paper said.

Williams played a father in an unstable marriage who disguises himself as a female nanny in order to spend more time with his children.

In Boulder, a similar memorial appeared at a home featured in 'Mork and Mindy,' a 1980s sitcom in which Williams played an alien.
