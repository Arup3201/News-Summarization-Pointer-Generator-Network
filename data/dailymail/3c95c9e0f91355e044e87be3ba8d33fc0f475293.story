'It's best for me to get back into reality': Former football star Paul Gascoigne spoke today about his battle with alcohol addiction

Fallen football hero Paul Gascoigne has told how he begged doctors not to let him die after flying to America to undergo intense treatment in his battle against alcohol.

The ex-England and Newcastle player said he was rushed to hospital where medics did not think he was going to survive. 

But in his first television interview since leaving the rehabilitation centre in Phoenix, Arizona earlier this month, the 45-year-old said he was on the road to recovery and feeling 'good.'

He said on ITV1's Daybreak programme:
‘I went to the treatment centre, and they tried to detox me, and they 
couldn't, so they rushed me to hospital, and that's where it got quite 
serious.

‘I just 
remember the guy saying to the doctor in the treatment centre, “I don't 
think this guy's going to make it”, and obviously I put my head up a 
little bit, and I had tubes all over my arms and body, and getting 
injected, and I said, please don't let me die, I need to water the 
plants. The plants were more important than me. The plants passed away 
and I survived.

‘People are saying it's too early for me to be talking, but it's best for me to get back to reality straight away.

‘I'm quite excited what the future holds - I had a bad time.’

Gascoigne, who also played for Lazio and Tottenham Hotspur,went into rehab in January after Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England 
cricketer Ronnie Irani organised it.

Gascoigne
thanked celebrities including Evans and 
footballer Gary Mabbutt for their help. Mabbutt is recovering in 
hospital himself after emergency bypass surgery on his leg, and 
Gascoigne said: ‘Get well Gaz.’

The former player added: ‘Seeing the support I had, people are out there caring.

‘Sometimes I feel it's easy for me to get treatment, but this time was horrific.’

When asked what he’d like to be doing in five years time, he said the main thing he hoped for would be that he was enjoying life.

He said: 'Maybe I’d like another kid or 
settled down but just enjoying myself you know I turned down loads of 
things I was invited to because I didn’t want to go because I didn’t 
have someone to take with us but the main thing is I just want to be 
available for everyone out there you know and if I’m good then I can 
make someone else good and help them as well I just feel I’ve got loads 
to offer and I’m enjoying life.

'Even though it was only six weeks 
ago I died in hospital a few times and I feel I’m back stronger than 
ever before. and I know I’ve said this before but you know but I’ve just
got to keep it in the day, and look to the future as well you know.'

Asked
about comparisons with the late former Manchester United star George 
Best, Gascoigne said: ‘God bless him, he's passed away, and I was 
friends with George, but I just felt like George didn't want to get 
well. I'm trying so hard to do it.’

The footballer, who said he loves being sober, quipped: ‘I didn't ask to be an alcoholic, but I must admit I worked on it.

‘I went to any lengths to get my drink, I'll go even further to stay sober.’

The move came following a charity appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

At the time he said that boredom was to blame for his latest setback in battling to overcome his addiction.
