An obesity pill that transforms 'bad' fat to 'good' could replace exercise, helping people shed pounds and with them their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.

That is the claim by scientists who believe they have made a breakthrough in the battle against the bulge.

They said the discovery could be 'the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill'.

Harvard Stem Cell Institute at Havard and Massachusetts General Hospital have identified two compounds that can turn white or 'bad' fat cells into brown 'good' fat cells in the body. 

When a person eats too many calories without burning them off, they are stored as white fat cells by adult stem cells.

That is what causes people to pile on the pounds. 

The new study found two small molecules that convert fat stem cells, which would normally produce white fat, into brown-like fat cells.

These brown fat cells burn excess energy and subsequently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells.

Associate professor Chad Cowan, at Harvard, said: 'What we were really impressed by is that there are some compounds that have this same kind of effect when they are administered to animals, but when you remove them, the effect goes away.

'But what we saw here was a stable conversion of the white fat cells to brown cells.

'You're constantly replenishing your fat tissue so if you were on a medication to convert the cells, each new fat cell would be more metabolically active and would convert to brown fat over time.' 

The researchers said this reduces the chances of a person developing type 2 diabetes, or any of the other conditions related to a build-up of fat.

One of the two molecules is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but scientists warned a pill is some way off.

They warned the compounds could damage the immune system.  

Associate professor Cowan warned these compounds 'target the same molecule, and that molecule plays a role in the inflammatory response'.

He added: 'So if you administered them for a long time, the person taking them could become immune compromised.'

The compounds were found by screening a library of about 1,000 compounds.

They said the discovery could be 'the first step towards a pill that can replace the treadmill'. Harvard Stem Cell Institute at Havard and Massachusetts General Hospital have identified two compounds that can turn white or 'bad' fat cells into brown 'good' fat cells in the body (picture posed by models)

The team said a typical pharmaceutical company library has between 1.5 and 2 million compounds, meaning there could be more similar compounds out there.  

A German team is currently carrying out tests on the two compounds on laboratory mice and associate professor Cowan added: 'We expect to have results fairly soon.

'The compounds appear to work the same way in mice, but we don't know what the long term metabolic or immune system effects are.

'The good news and bad news is that science is slow; just establishing proof of concept takes an enormous amount of time.

'We thought that working with stem cells would lead to the discovery of new drugs and therapies, and now it's really starting to happen - a decade of hard basic scientific work is paying off.'

White fat cells store energy as lipids and play a role in the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related conditions - including heart disease

Brown fat has been shown in mice to lower triglyceride levels, reduce the insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes, and burn white fat.

However the team pointed out that although any pill might help us stay slim, it would not replace the other benefits of exercise.

A team of scientists have identified a hormone causes a person to pile on weight, triggering obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The study found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood.

The hormone inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the 'good' fat that can be burned off - activity. 

Brown adipose tissue, known as brown fat, is located around the collarbone and acts as the body's furnace, burning calories to keep the body warm.

Obese people have lower levels of brown fat, and its activity decreases with age.

But until now, scientists have not known why.

The study by McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found there are two different types of serotonin.

Scientists at Canada's McMaster University found obese people have higher levels of the hormone serotonin in the blood (picture posed by model)

One type is found in the brain or central nervous system affects mood and appetite, but makes up only five per cent of the body's serotonin. 

The lesser-known peripheral serontonin circulates in the blood, and makes up 95 per cent of the hormone in the body.

McMaster scientists discovered that this kind of serotonin reduces brown fat activity, or 'dials down' the body's metabolic furnace. 

The study, published in Nature Medicine, is the first to show blocking the production of peripheral serotonin makes brown fat more active.

Professor of medicine Gregory Steinberg, said: 'Our results are quite striking and indicate that inhibiting the production of this hormone may be very effective for reversing obesity and related metabolic diseases including diabetes

'Too much of this serotonin acts like the parking brake on your brown fat. You can step on the gas of the brown fat, but it doesn't go anywhere.'

And the scientists believe they may also have identified the culprit responsible for elevated levels of peripheral serotonin - high-fat Western diets. 

Associate professor of pathology and molecular medicine Waliul Khan, added: 'There is an environmental cue that could be causing higher serotonin levels in our body and that is the high-fat western diet.

'Too much serotonin is not good. We need a balance. If there is too much, it leads to diabetes, fatty liver and obesity.'

The hormone, a model of which is pictured, inhibits the beneficial effects of brown fat - the 'good' fat that can be burned off - activity

The majority of serotonin in the body is produced by tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph1).

The study found that when they genetically removed or inhibited this enzyme that makes serotonin, mice fed a high-fat diet were protected from obesity, fatty liver disease and pre-diabetes due to an enhanced ability of the brown fat to burn more calories.

Inhibiting the peripheral serotonin doesn't affect the serotonin in the brain or central nervous system functioning.

This is in contrast to earlier weight loss drugs which worked to suppress appetite by affecting levels of brain serotonin, but were associated with problems including cardiac complications and increased risk of depression and suicide.

Professor Steinberg said: 'Moving forward, we think it's a much safer method to work with increasing energy expenditure instead of decreasing the appetite, which involves more risks.'

The researchers conclude that reducing the production of serotonin by inhibition of Tph1 'may be an effective treatment for obesity and its comorbidities,' and so the team is now working on a pharmacological 'enzyme blocker'.
