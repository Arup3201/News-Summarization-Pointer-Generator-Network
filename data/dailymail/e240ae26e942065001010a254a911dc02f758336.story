The mother of murdered schoolboy Rhys Jones has slammed a decision to release the gangster who supplied his murder weapon - leaving just one of the seven-strong gang in prison.

Rhys was just 11 when he was gunned down by 16-year-old Sean Mercer, aided by six others, on his way home from football practice in Croxteth, Liverpool, in 2007.

But James Yates - who supplied the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill the child - has walked free from jail this month to the outrage of Rhys' family.

Murder weapon: Yates supplied the First World War Smith & Wesson revolver used to kill Rhys Jones

It means only Mercer, who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years, is left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime.

Nathan Quinn, Dean Kelly, Gary Kays, Melvin Coy and a 16-year-old who could not be named have all served their sentences.

Rhys' mother Melanie told the Daily Mirror: 'It's terrible. It takes us back to the night Rhys died. It seems like only yesterday that Yates was sent to jail.

'He may not have pulled the trigger, but he was minding the gun. For us, Yates is the most evil of them all. He makes my skin crawl.'

Yates was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill Rhys and helping Mercer cover his tracks.

He and two other members of the Croxteth Crew - Quinn, 18, and Kelly, 17 - winked, smiled, smirked and cheered in the bulletproof dock as they were handed sentences blasted as 'disgusting' by Rhys' family.

The trial judge, Mr Justice Irwin, told Yates: 'There is strong evidence you were an active gang member 'I have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could.'

Yates' term was later increased to 12 years by the Lord Chief Justice, who attacked the 'modern pestilence' of gun crime.

But because Yates spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial, that time counted towards his final sentence.

That means he has spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy's murderer.

He has been released on licence midway through his sentence, as is commonplace, and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years.

Rhys died on August 22, 2007, when Mercer, armed with a revolver, cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival Strand Gang.

Rhys was struck by his second bullet, suffering terrible injuries.

The 'wall of silence' faced by police meant that while Mercer's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting, months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder.

The gun itself, a .455 calibre Smith and Wesson revolver with a six-inch barrel, may have been handed down through generations of Liverpool criminals.

It was made during the First World War in about 1915, but remained in good working order.

The rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by Mercer were slightly undersized, causing them to tumble end-over-end.

That meant the round which hit Rhys was side-on when it struck him in the back of the neck, splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat.

The Croxeth Crew also had an imitation Walther PPK converted to fire live rounds, a British Army Webley revolver and a Russian 7.62 handgun.

A probation service spokesman told MailOnline he would not comment on individual cases.

He added: 'Public protection is our priority. Serious offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions and can be recalled to prison if they breach them.

'When released from prison, offenders managed through Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) will be risk assessed, monitored and supervised by probation, police and other agencies.'
