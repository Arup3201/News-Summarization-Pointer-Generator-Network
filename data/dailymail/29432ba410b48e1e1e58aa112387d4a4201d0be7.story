Two travellers who persuaded an elderly dementia sufferer to drop off £73,500 in cash at a bus stop or a lay-by have been jailed for a total of eight-and-a-half years.

Father-of-six Hughie Doherty, 31, his brother Francis, 36, and the pair's brother-in-law David Young, conned the 84-year-old widow out of nearly all her life-savings by pretending to be solicitors.

The men's scam was exposed when her bank manager became suspicious as they tried to extract £15,000 from the frail victim, who lived alone in the village of Blunham, Bedfordshire.

Father of six Hughie Doherty, 31, was jailed for five years at Northampton Crown Court while his brother Francis is set to be sentenced at a later date. Both conned the elderly woman out of most of her life savings

The Doherty brothers, from Northamptonshire, denied playing any part in the theft of the money and said they made their living breeding a horse known as the Gypsy Cob.

The woman, who was in the early stages of dementia, received a telephone call, in the summer of 2010, from a man calling himself Oliver, who spoke with a middle class, professional accent and said he was a solicitor.

'Oliver' claimed he could help her get back £25,000 she lost when she had fallen victim to a seperate scam.

He also said they could retrieve money she had handed over to 'lawyers' after shoddy work had been carried out on her driveway in 2004.

Again the victim was told she would have to pay for advanced legal services and, as a result, was persuaded to cash in her insurance policies.

David Young, the pair's brother-in-law was jailed for three-and-a-half years for his part in the scam

In the months that followed, she got cash out of her bank account on eight occasions which, following instructions from the man, she put in envelopes and left at either a bus stop in Blunham or at a nearby lay-by.

Between the summer of 2010 and February 2011 she handed over £73,500.

Prosecutor David Stanton said none of the money had ever been recovered.

He said: 'These despicable offences were a planned operation by three defendants who took advantage of an 84 year old woman who was suffering from dementia.

'She didn't confide in her family or say what was going on. No legal work was being carried out for her.

'She was being taken for the money. All the money was stolen from her.'

In March 2011, Bedfordshire Police were alerted after the manager at a NatWest bank branch in Bedford became concerned.

He checked her account and discovered the eight earlier withdrawals. The manager called her son, who contacted the police.

A few days later the victim received a call from 'Oliver' telling her she should go to the bank that day and withdraw £15,000.

A trap was set and police were watching when a green Landrover Discovery with three men inside was seen twice driving slowly past the woman's home.

Not long afterwards it was involved in a short police chase before stopping.

The three men were Inside the car, along with Young's mobile phone which had been dismantled.

Mr McLouglin said a police sniffer dog and its handler later followed the route the Landrover had taken during the short chase and, as a result, three pieces of paper were found by the roadside.

One had the name of the pensioner written on it together with her phone number.

Drop-off: The men would make the frail woman leave money at a bus stop in Blunham or at a nearby lay-by

Fingerprints from Young and Francis Doherty were found on the documents and, when Young's mobile phone was analysed, officers discovered it had been used to make 13 calls to the woman's home that day.

Francis Doherty, 36, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire and his 31-year-old brother Hughie from Rushden pleaded not guilty to theft.

They denied a second charge of attempting to steal £15,000 from her in March 2011 on the day of their arrest.

But both were 
convicted by a jury at Luton Crown Court at an earlier hearing. Young 
pleaded guilty to the charges of theft and attempted theft.

Home: The dementia sufferer lived on her own in the quiet village of Blunham in Bedfordshire

Concern: The alarm was raised when the bank managed at NatWest branch in Bedford noticed £15,000 had been withdrawn from the victim's account

At the time, Hughie Doherty was in breach of a 12 month sentence, suspended for two years, passed at Northampton Crown Court in  2010 for fraud by false representation.

He had posed as a Trading Standard Officer and tried to extract £7,000 from a 72-year-old man.

Judge Stuart Bridge sentenced Hughie Doherty to a total of five years in prison. He jailed father-of-one Young, a ground worker who had spent 11 months on remand in custody, to three-and-a-half years.

He said: 'The fragile mental state of the victim was perfectly apparent. It was an audacious fraud, carefully planned and callously executed. You realised she was easy prey. You were insatiable and carried on taking, taking and taking.'

The judge said the effect on the victim was 'appalling' and she will never recover.

The judge adjourned sentencing on Francis Doherty, as his barrister was not present.
