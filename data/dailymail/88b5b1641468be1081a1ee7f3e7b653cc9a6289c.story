Stuffed hamster fascinator, anyone?

London based taxidermist Margot Magpie, 31, has designed and created a range of hats and hair accessories using dead animals such as mice and birds.

Margot who lives in Battersea, took up the macabre hobby three years ago.

Eccentric: Margot started taxidermy three years ago. Her one-of-a-kind range of headwear pieces are made by hand and sell for around £60

Unique: Margot uses dead animals such as birds to decorate hats or make hair accessories

Her eccentric, one-of-a-kind range of headwear pieces are made by hand and sell for around £60 each.

Most are commissioned by clients and are all completely unique, so you can be sure not to be wearing the same outfit as anyone else.

'I originally started out making hats for myself and my friends to wear,' says Margot.

'They would ask me to make something for a wedding or events, or just for fun as I am very creative and I tend to use different techniques and materials.

Birds of a feather: 'I love birds and wanted to incorporate unused bits of the ones I found dead on the ground as roadkill,' says Margot of her quirky designs

Hobby: 'I think birds are just stunning,' says Margot, pictured here. 'Especially when you are close enough to see the fine detail and colour'

'Taxidermy just made sense to me as something you might wear on your head or just on your person.

'I love birds and wanted to incorporate unused bits of the ones I found dead on the ground as roadkill.

'I thought that as a fashion statement it was unique as each bird wing is shaped differently depending on the bird type, and I love the asymmetry and pointy yet smooth edges the feathers create.

'I think birds are just stunning, especially when you are close enough to see the fine detail and colour.

'Many people think a crow wing is just black, but there is so much more spectrum to the colour and all birds have this.'

Controversy: 'Sometimes I do get negative reactions,' says Margot. 'People think it is absolutely appalling, cruel or disrespectful, but I don't kill any animals'

Quirky: Margot teaches a range of taxidermy classes across London showing clients how to gut, clean, stuff and pose a mice, birds and small mammals

Quirky
 Margot teaches a range of taxidermy classes across London showing 
clients how to gut, clean, stuff and pose a mice, birds and small 
mammals into a variety of 'cute' positions.

The
 classes have proved extremely popular and Margot is also available for 
private classes, specialising in guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, birds 
and other animals.

She
 added: 'Sometimes I do get negative reactions, I get people telling me 
they think it is absolutely appalling, cruel or disrespectful.

'But I don't kill anything purposefully for taxidermy, so I don't have any issues with it.

'There will always be people who think it is distasteful or who are against it - but each to their own.

'Usually
 if I make a batch and put them online, they sell very very fast. 
However I have recently starting just taking commissions.

'It
 is more personalised and I think people enjoy experiencing the creative
 process with me ie chosing colours, fabric, and sourcing particular 
birds.'
