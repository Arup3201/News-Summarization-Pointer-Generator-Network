They have put aside Max Bygraves, forgotten Dame Vera Lynn and eschewed Sir Cliff Richard – these trendy pensioners are getting down to the Pharrell Williams’s hit Happy.

The staff and residents of Gosberton House Care Home in Lincolnshire have videoed themselves dancing along to the Number 1 smash hit.

They spent weeks learning their routines and then spent two days in front of the camera filming the video.

The video also sees carers dancing with a bed, an iron and a vacuum cleaner but has already attracted nearly 2,000 views online.

The Happy song featured in the Despicable Me 2 soundtrack and was the lead single on Williams' second studio album GIRL.

It's sold more than 1.3million copies in the UK and has reached the number one spot in the UK chart on three separate occasions.

General manager Janet Eastgate said: ‘Myself and the staff were quite reluctant to do it at first, and thought 'are you joking?', but we soon changed our mind.

‘All of the residents who consented to being in the video were really happy to do it and they really enjoyed being part of the video, as did the staff.

These staff and residents at a care home hope to prove they really are happy - by releasing a video of themselves dancing around to the Pharell Williams hit

'Care homes
 often get quite a bad rap in the media, with some being shown to be 
quite horrible, and we wanted to show that we're not all like that and 
that we are a really nice team in a nice place. 

‘Everyone
 who has seen it enjoyed it and we have had a very positive response 
from everyone - people are now recognising me in the street.

‘The video was a one off, and we certainly aren't planning on changing our careers any time soon.’

Sandra
 Brigham, the administrator at the care home, said: ‘I think the 
philosophy of Janet and the owners really makes this place and it really
 does have a great atmosphere here, which you can definitely see in the 
video.’ 

Staff and residents threw themselves into the practicing and filming their version of Happy, the Number 1 song
