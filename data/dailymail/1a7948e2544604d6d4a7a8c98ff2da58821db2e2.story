'Is he dead'?

Not quite, but that's the reaction many shared when they watched Parkour runner Matt Quinlan plunge through the air before ploughing face-first into the side of a shipping container.

Mr Quinlan, from New Zealand, was attempting the last leap of a routine Parkour run up and down several shipping containers before completely misjudging the final hurdle.

After pacing through the circuit at speed, Quinlan had just one last leap to make but slipped in the process - smashing his face on the side of the steel container.

Matt Gilmour lost his front tooth in the Parkour incident he was taking part in with a friend

The slip-up cost the Parkour runner dearly when he lifted his head to reveal a missing tooth and what would appear to be an expensive dental bill.

A friend, who filmed the whole incident from behind, found the lost tooth on the ground when he went to help Mr Quinlan but let him know that it was likely he was in for more than just a headache.

'That's going to cost quite a few f****ing dollars to replace mate,' he said, staring down into his wide smile.

'Let's go, I'll drive you to the hospital.' 

Mr Quinlan required three stitches in the incident but was lucky not to do more serious damage when he fell limp to the ground after the failed jump.

Mr Quinland hit his face and then fell limp to the ground below 

He’d apparently done the jump twice before, but this time his shoes were wet and he lost grip when he when to push off from a standing start.

The video was posted on a page dedicated to the 'World's Best Parkour and Freerunning Videos' but it's not because of Mr Quinlan's style or grace that his clip appeared on there.

Those dedicated to the sport of Parkour took to YouTube to school the amateur in how to perform the stunt correctly, criticising his technique on the last jump.

YouTuber Clay Eickemeyer said it was Parkour suicide to jump from a standing start. 

'Looks like when he went up to do the jump, his feet were right behind the shallow trim on the sides, so when he jumped, his feet caught on it and his body flew in front, ' YouTuber Clay Eickemeyer said.

'Moral of the story: standing jumps kill people, do running jumps always.' 

Responding to his online pasting,  Mr Gilmour said injuries are part of the sport and that he wasn't a 'Parkour wannabe'. 

'We've been training for years but this was an accidental slip,' he said.
