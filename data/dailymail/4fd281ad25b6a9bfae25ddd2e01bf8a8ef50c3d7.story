Her side of the story: Maria Di Toro, now 31, has opened up for the first time about how she claims she was raped by Greg Kelly in 2011, though no charges were ever filed

The woman who accused a prominent New York news anchor of rape has spoken out for the first time after the alleged 2011 attack.

Maria Di Toro accused Greg Kelly, who was known for his role as a local Fox News anchor and the son of the then-police commissioner Ray Kelly, of rape but the district attorney’s office refused to prosecute citing a lack of evidence.

As soon as it became clear that charges were not going to be filed, her name was released publicly but an exclusive new interview with Buzzfeed that was published Monday marked the first time that she or her longtime boyfriend had ever spoken about the ordeal.

‘I was really scared into submission,' Ms Di Toro told Buzzfeed.

‘I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I realize that I didn’t do all that I could have done to stand up for myself… I was always like a puny little thing, but I always stood up for myself… And I didn’t this time. And it’s eaten away at my core every day.’

The alleged assault took place in early October 2011. According to Ms Di Toro, she met Kelly on the street and approached him to say that he looked better in person than he did on television.

At this point in time, she was a 29-year-old paralegal and had been dating her then-48-year-old boyfriend for three years.

When she happened to meet Kelly, who was also in a relationship, he asked for her number and they began a texting exchange that went from ‘casual, G-rated stuff’ to ‘casual, trusting, and consensually explicit’.

At one point, they spoke by phone while she was at her law office about what their favorite sexual positions.

They agreed to get drinks on Saturday October 8 at a bar in the South Street Seaport called Jeremy’s Ale House, and Kelly paid for the first round of drinks before she returned the favor with both the second and third rounds. She told the police, and more recently Buzzfeed, that after only two sips of the third drink, she became strongly impaired and she can only remember the rest of the afternoon in snippets.

They walked back to her law office, and she remembered a flashback of being pushed up against a building and kissed by Kelly. Then she remembers being on the floor in her office and seeing him bare-chested on top of her. He allegedly told her to ‘get up, get up, get up’ at one point and she could not move.

Accused: Greg Kelly is a co-anchor for Good Day New York on the local Fox affiliate and the district attorney chose to never charge him in the case. He maintained his innocence throughout

Backlash: The day after the district attorney announced that they would not be pressing charges, The New York Post- which is owned by the same company that owns the network where Kelly is a co-anchor- revealed her identity and put her on the front page

She also says that he was later sitting and looking at his phone as he asked her if she was on the pill- which she was not because her boyfriend, Francis Laros, had had a vasectomy.

She spent the rest of the weekend refusing to talk to her relatives about what happened and feeling nauseous. She eventually told her boyfriend and her twin sister, and they both came to the conclusion that Kelly had raped her.

On Monday, Kelly called her and talked to her about how drunk they had been on Saturday- after only two full drinks- and when he asked if she had a good time, she said she could not remember.

He then filled in the details, allegedly reliving graphic details and telling specifics about their alleged sexual encounter. He concluded the call by asking if she wanted to ‘f*** again’ and she said that she ‘croaked out “Yeah, sure.”’

They never met in person again. She spoke to him again two days later and told her that her boyfriend had found out and that her life ‘had been turned upside down’. She aked him if there was any possibility she could be pregnant from their encounter and he reportedly said no, and when she asked if he had put something in her drink, he allegedly said that he did not like what she was implying.

‘I wasn’t accusing him of anything, but I couldn’t believe I got that drunk off only two drinks and couldn’t remember the whole evening, not even remember the hours later and how I got home,’ she wrote in an official statement to the district attorney.

Their conversation ended with Kelly reportedly saying that he would call her in a month ‘when things cooled down’ but that never happened- and tensions only continued to mount when she realized two weeks later that she was pregnant.

Both she and her boyfriend had tried getting in touch with Kelly- with her boyfriend even saying something to his father, Ray Kelly, when he happened to pass him on the street just days after the alleged rape. Greg Kelly never responded to any of their texts or voicemails.

Ms Di Toro sought council from nuns at a mission on the Upper East Side who agreed that she had been raped, and she determined that she would get an abortion, which a letter from a Manhattan doctor confirmed on November 12.

It was not until January 24, 2012 that Ms Di Toro reported the incident to police, and considering three months had passed after the alleged rape, there was no tangible evidence that they could use against Kelly in any court of law, but she had known that from the beginning, citing knowledge gleaned from reports of other rapes and Law and Order: SVU.

She explained to Buzzfeed that it took time for her to conceptualize the fact that she had been raped, not to mention the time that she needed to decide to come forward with the support of her boyfriend, who has stayed by her side throughout.

‘All I kept thinking for those three months is that if my niece came up to me and told me what happened to me happened to her, I would want to kill the man and make sure she got justice,’ she said.

That was not the case for Ms Di Toro, however, as the chief of the district attorney’s sex crimes unit released a letter saying that no charges would be filed against Kelly because ‘the facts established during our investigation do not fit the definitions of sexual assault crimes under New York criminal law. Therefore, no criminal charges are appropriate’.

‘Because of that letter, the press was able to say, “Here’s physical proof that what she’s saying is a lie.” Because of that letter, the press got a free pass to tell me, along with the rest of the world, that what happened to me didn’t happen to me. Because of that stupid letter, they’re saying I was not raped,’ Ms Di Toro told Buzzfeed.

Kelly’s station, Fox5, is owned by the same parent company as the New York Post which led the local coverage of the accusations, using quotes from unidentified colleagues who said that he was a nice guy who they could never imagine involved in such a situation.

Two days after the letter from the district attorney’s office was released, the Post ran a picture of Di Toro wearing a large sunhat that they took from her Facebook account as the front page with the headline ‘Shady Lady’.

‘I thought that was one of the most personal things they could have ever done. They didn’t kill my mother or anything, but they came pretty damn close to it. It felt like being violated a second time, third time, fourth time,’ she said of the coverage.

After taking a leave of absence following the initial onset of the investigation, Kelly returned to the morning news the day after the ‘Shady Lady’ cover and thanked his fans for staying by him after a ‘tough couple of weeks’. Kelly, now 45, remains one of the Good Day New York co-anchors.

In a statement released after the district attorney’s letter, he said he was ‘thankful that the investigation established what I’ve known all along, that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered.’
