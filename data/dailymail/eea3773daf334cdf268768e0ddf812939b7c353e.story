Dominique Ansel's now world-famous pastry - the cronut - celebrated its first birthday last month.

Since introducing the croissant-donut hybrid, the New York bakery has seen lines
 around the block from dawn every morning and there have been countless 
copies rolled out across the world.

But there's a new sweet treat on the block hoping to knock the cronut from the top spot as the world's most fashionable sweet treat.

Say hello to the 'biskie', a fresh, handmade creation that prides itself as the combination of the best bits of a cookie, cake and a biscuit.

Watch out, cronut! There's a new sweet treat hoping to take the bakery world by storm called the Biskie - a cookie, cake and biscuit hybrid

The new pastry, which starts at £2.20 per piece, describes itself as 'not a macaroon or a whoopie pie 
and not quite a biscuit or a cookie but a crisp and melt-in-the-mouth treat with an incredibly light whipped buttercream filling'.

With two cookies as the outer biscuits, the Biskie is layered with handmade jams and caramels and is made with all-natural colourings and flavourings.

Developed by the Cutter & Squidge bakery in London, Biskies are available in 12 flavours, with more being created every day.

Signature flavours include green tea, white chocolate and raspberry, milk chocolate with peanut and salted caramel, and almond, raspberry and cherry.

The creators of the Biskie are Annabel and Emily Lui, two food-obsessed sisters who run the Cutter & Squidge bakery.

With a family background in food, the women started in a tiny kitchen in North West London and now they're getting set to launch their own biskies pop-up in Selfridges food hall on June 30.

They say their passion inventing new products, recreating time-honored classics and above all, creating cutting-edge taste sensations.

Being health-conscious, Annabel and Emily use only the best natural ingredients for all their products and reduce fat where possible. Their specially created buttercream is made with half the amount of butter and sugar normally used in baking and their homemade jams are made with real fruit - each biskie has around 175 calories.

They also do not use any margarine or hydro-fats and, where possible, use ingredients sourced from British producers, they say.

Speaking about their creation, they said: 'We are both self-taught bakers with no formal training but set up Cutter & Squidge, a new innovative-baked goods company based in Fulham in 2013.

'Our cooking ethos is to use all natural ingredients - no artificial colourings or flavourings. When we are creating something with passion fruit then it is made out of fresh passion fruits which we cut and scoop our ourselves, it's more expensive and time-consuming than buying ready-made puree but the flavour from a fresh passion fruit is unparalleled.

'If the biskie is green it's because we've used premium Japanese green tea which is naturally vibrant green, no need for artificial colourings and it tastes amazing.

'We have even created our own colour tints from fruits, veggies and spices to colour our own flowers and sprinkles. It is amazing how many colours you can derive from a red cabbage (including green!) using a bit of natural kitchen chemistry.'

So what do they taste like? FEMAIL's resident food expert, Martha Cliff, said: ‘When we thought there were enough hybrids in the world (cronuts, labradoodles and Kimye), they found another.

'A funny cross between a whoopee pie and an ice cream sandwich, it’s fair to say that the three quarters I managed to wrestle to myself were not enough.

'The spiced vanilla and passionfruit was particularly moreish with its chewy exterior and creamy centre, this ain’t no rich tea!’.
