Ever wondered what celebrities eat when they're not nibbling on canapes at events or dining at lavish restaurants? 

Thanks to a new charity cookbook we know exactly what David Cameron cooks for Samantha after a long day in Parliament and just how Russell Brand gets an energy kick in the morning.

Estate agent Strutt & Parker has launched a charity cookery book featuring 52 celebrity recipes by high profile actors, singers, chefs, politicians and sports people in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.

Chef Cameron: Thanks to a new charity cookbook, Food With Heart, we know exactly what David Cameron cooks for Samantha behind the doors of Number 10 Downing Street 

Highlights of the book, entitled Food with Heart, include David Cameron’s very own Italian pasta dish, which he likes to cook for Samantha and the children at No.10, Simon Cowell’s cottage pie, Gary Lineker’s lasagne and even Russell Brand’s detox ‘green breakfast’ smoothie. 

Those with a sweeter tooth can choose between an array of superstar desserts including Elizabeth Hurley’s decadent chocolate mousse, Amanda Holden’s shortbread and Jack Whitehall’s bread and butter pudding.

Inside, the recipes have been brought to life with drawings by distinctive illustrator Louise Morgan, well known for her instantly-recognisable work for Waitrose.

Skills: David, who can be seen cooking up a storm with President Obama, loves to cook Italian pasta with red wine and lots of double cream 

It seems that the Prime Minister has taken inspiration from the River Cafe - his pasta dish, which is crammed with spicy Italian sausage, red wine and double cream, is a shortened adapted version of the London restaurant.

Tony Blair's baba ghanouj recipe was inspired by his travels to the Middle East and he says that he 'loves' the dish and has it 'all the time' when he's visiting.

Funny man Jack Whitehall has shared his hot cross bun/pannettone bread and butter pudding recipe and said: 'This won me Comic Relief Masterchef. I was up against Micky Flanagan, who cooked a fish and orange dish, so it wasn't the best competition.'

Russell Brand's super clean green smoothie recipe is full of apples, pineapple, ginger, cucumber, spinach, celery and chard, while Emma Bunton's 'delicious squidgy chocolate cake' is a little less virtuous.

Every single penny raised from Food with Heart’s sales will go directly to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity. The money will to help fund an ambitious redevelopment programme, which will improve two-thirds of the hospital, providing state-of-the-art facilities to match the hospital’s world-class standards of care.

A spokesperson for Strutt & Parker, said: 'Having already raised £160,000 for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity last year, this book marks the final part of our challenge for the charity. 

'It started as a simple idea but gained a life of its own, as a host of very generous celebrities - from prime ministers, actors and sports stars, to professional chefs and food enthusiasts - contributed their own special recipes. We’re extremely proud to present this special and lasting cookbook which we couldn’t have done without the help of our creative partners at Sunday, who have donated their time and energy to design the book.'

Where the magic happens: Samantha Cameron chats with First Lady Michelle Obama in the new kitchen the Camerons had installed in their apartment at No 11 Downing St

Budding chefs? The recipes featured include Tony Blair's middle eastern dish and Gary Lineker's lasagne

A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity added: 'We would not be able to turn this vision into a reality without the wonderful support we received.

'Money raised through the sale of this book will contribute towards the appeal and will make a real difference to the lives of seriously ill children and their families.'

SERVES 4

INGREDIENTS

500g (1lb) organic, best quality, very lean mince beef

2 medium onions, chopped

1 carrot, chopped very small

Salt and pepper

1⁄2 tsp mixed herbs

1 tbsp fresh parsley

300ml (10 fl oz) beef stock

1kg (2lb) potatoes, peeled and chopped

Butter

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 190°C/350°F/Gas mark 5.

Fry the beef in a frying pan – no need to add oil as the mince has natural fat.

Once the meat has started to brown slightly, add the onions and carrot. Stir the meat so the onions and carrots can go to the bottom of the pan, frying in the meat juices for about 10 minutes.

When the onions and carrots are slightly browned, add the salt and pepper to season, mixed herbs and fresh parsley.

Give the mixture another stir in the pan, adding the beef stock. Simmer on a low heat until the meat is fully cooked.

In a large pan, boil the potatoes in salted water until cooked.

Drain the potatoes and mash them with butter, salt and pepper to season.

Put the meat into a casserole dish and top with mashed potatoes. Pop in the preheated oven until golden brown.
