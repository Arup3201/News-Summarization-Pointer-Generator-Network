The number of concerned holidaymakers paying to fast-track their passport application has surged because of the backlog crisis.

Thousands upgraded to the £128 premium four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time for their holiday.

There were just six upgrades in January, before the Mail exposed the chaos at UK passport offices, which saw staff struggling to cope with a surge in passport applications.  

Delays: As a result of the backlog, revealed by the Mail, thousands upgraded to the £128 premium four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time for their holiday

But in the three months to May, 2,137 people paid for the upgrade, with 1,024 in May alone – a 170-fold increase. 

A standard passport costs £72.50, meaning the Passport Office has made an extra £55.50 for each person who upgraded. Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh has admitted the agency is set to make £50million in profit this year.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘The Government needs to sort out this mess.

‘It is just plain wrong the Government expects to pocket an extra £50million this year from the Passport Office ... and [it] needs to reimburse people for the upgrade charges they were forced to pay just to get a basic service.’

But passports minister James Brokenshire said: ‘There are no plans to reimburse customers who choose to use the four-hour premium service.’
