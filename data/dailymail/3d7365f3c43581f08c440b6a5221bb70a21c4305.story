He has ‘no regrets’ about water-boarding terror suspects, told George W. Bush to bomb Syria and prepared a secret signed resignation letter.

These are just three of the explosive revelations from former U.S. vice president Dick Cheney ahead of the release of his highly-anticipated book.

Mr Cheney still insists the U.S. invasion of Iraq was the right decision and explained how he was unconscious for weeks after heart surgery last year.

New book: Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has 'no regrets' about water-boarding terror suspects and told George W. Bush to bomb Syria

The controversial politician said he 
still supports harsh interrogation policies used by the Bush 
administration after the 9/11 attacks.

Book: 'In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir' by Dick Cheney is scheduled for release next week

‘I would strongly support using it 
again if circumstances arose where we had a high-value detainee and that
was the only way we could get him to talk,’ he told NBC.

He also claimed that President George W. Bush rejected his advice in 2007 to bomb a suspected nuclear reactor site in Syria.

Mr Cheney said he was a ‘lone voice’ 
for military action against Syria and other advisers were also 
reluctant, reported the New York Times.

He claimed this was because of ‘bad 
intelligence we had received about Iraq's stockpiles of weapons of mass 
destruction’ before the 2003 invasion.

The Israelis ended up bombing the Syrian site later in 2007.

Mr Cheney bemoaned 'concessions 
delivered' to North Korea 'in the naive hope that despots would respond 
in kind’, reported the Drudge Report.

He also said Mr Bush was given ‘utterly misleading’ advice - but that invading Iraq was the right decision, even considering poor intelligence.

Explosive: Mr Cheney's memoir is expected to make many in Washington uncomfortable as it reveals much insider information

Mr Cheney claimed Guantanamo Bay only damages the image of the U.S. abroad because President Barack Obama 'peddles falsehoods about it.'

He also prepared and signed a 
secret resignation letter in 2001 shortly after taking office and kept 
it in a safe, in case of a possible health crisis.

Mr Cheney, who has a long history of 
heart disease, said concern about health issues was one of the main 
reasons he kept the letter.

Only Mr Bush and a Cheney staff member knew about the letter.

Mr Cheney warned his memoir is going 
to be highly controversial, saying: 'There are going be heads exploding 
all over Washington.'

Mr Cheney said in addition that Mr Bush should not feel betrayed by insider information he reveals in his new memoir.

'If you look at the book there are 
many places in it where I say some very fine things about George Bush,’ 
he said. ‘And believe every word of it.'

Mr Cheney was a lightning-rod for 
criticism during Mr Bush's presidency and accused of often 
advocating a belligerent U.S. stance in world affairs.

He also said former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was naïve and Colin Powell was right to resign after the 2004 election.

Mr Cheney claimed Mr Powell tried to undermine Bush ‘by criticising administration policy to people outside the government.’

And he said former CIA Director 
George Tenet's decision to resign ‘when the going got tough’ in 2004 was
‘unfair to the president’.
