A group of daring mums are axing the age-old stereotype that logging is a man's world by showing off their cracking hacking.

Named the 'most male dominated occupation' on the planet by researchers, logging sees up to 99.1 percent of all positions go to men - but these sharp-minded lumber ladies are world champions with an edge.

Their skills are enough to have the burliest of tree butchering males quivering in their steel-toed boots as they compete in mixed and female-only events to be crowned Queen Cutters.

The group of eight, known as Axe 
Women, boast a range of top awards, including six world champion 
accolades, and compete in categories such as underhand chopping, 
standing block chopping, hot sawing, cross cut sawing, axe throwing and 
log rolling.

Axe
Women's founder Alissa Harper has been a professional chopper for 12 
years and is delighted to be challenging the macho label.

Alissa said: 'I'm very proud, and all
my family are too, to be able to say that I'm a two-time world champion
in axe throwing and log rolling.

'Most
people seem very welcome to the idea. We get tons of people, men and 
women, who come up after shows and tell us stories of their fathers, 
grandfathers, great grandfathers being loggers. And that we've brought 
back memories.Â

Trophy: The group have six world champion accolades under their belt and are keen on gaining more

'We're 
very serious about our competing - we're pros after all - and take pride
in battling to be crowed the best hatchet handlers on the planet.'

The
team formed after former logger Alissa wanted to recruit other 
like-minded females to share her passion - she had been the only woman 
at her timber yard.

From tree scientists to dairy farmers, the women's day jobs vary from their passion and they have been competing around the world since 2006.

But the group, based in Maine, USA, would readily take on the risk of working in logging - an occupation that kills an average of 85 workers each year in America.

Despite the butch title, three of the group are settled with husbands and two are mums.

Alissa said: 'After a day of competing, or performing, sometimes a bubble bath sounds great, or a pedicure.

'But usually we all go out for cold beers as without doubt that's a much better way to relax.'
