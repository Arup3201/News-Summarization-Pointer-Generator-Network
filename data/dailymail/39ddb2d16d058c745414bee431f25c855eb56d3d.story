A man and a woman have been killed after a single-engine plane crashed at a small airport near downtown Kansas City.

Fire spokesman James Garrett says the plane crashed shortly after taking off Sunday afternoon from the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport. 

The plane crashed about 3pm near the levy just south from the runway.

Garrett says the two people killed were the only people on the plane. No other injuries were reported.

The victims' identities have not been released.

According to the Kansas City Star, the plane looked like it was turning back shortly after taking off.

'It turned like it was going back for a landing,' Navarrio Smith, who had been watching planes and witnessed the crash, told the Kansas City Star.

Smith said he saw the plane’s wheels but heard its engines go quiet. It then crossed the Missouri River, headed for the runway.

'It just dropped. There was no smoke, no boom, no fire.'

Garrett says the cause of the crash is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.

Kansas City International Airport Marketing Manager Joe McBride told Fox 4 that the plane was a Mooney Aircraft but did not specify the year.

The Kansas City star reports that rescuers found the airplane on its belly between the levy and the river with its wings attached and no sign a fire.

The man and a woman were dead inside.

Police closed the road around the airport as they began investigating the crash.

Charles B. Wheeler Airport, located a few miles west of downtown Kansas City, is used largely by corporate and recreational flyers.
