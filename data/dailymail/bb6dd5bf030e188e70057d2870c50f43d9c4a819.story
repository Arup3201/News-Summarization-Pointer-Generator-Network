It's a gadget that sounds like it is straight out of a James Bond movie - an iPhone that fires lasers.

But Apple is developing a new laser-based system for future generations of its iPhone devices.

Rather than cutting through handcuffs and walls like devices designed for 007, however, Apple is planning to use the feature to enable its phones to map their surroundings.

Apple's patent suggests the lasers could be mounted behind existing openings like the camera (label 20) or have its own dedicated opening (12) in the side of the phone that would then be pointed at walls or objects

The laser would be mounted inside the iPhone and used together with the inbuilt motion sensors to generate a map of any surface it is pointed at.

An iPhone-mounted sensor  would detect any light bounced back to the device and provide information about the surfaces of objects around it.

This  would allow the iPhone to be used to measure distance and create 3D maps of rooms and even buildings - something that currently requires bulky equipment.

Apple's patent proposes using motion detection hardware in the iPhone to allow users to freely move the laser along a wall to measure distances from one point to another or to build up a detailed map of the surroundings

According to Apple's patent, the laser mapping may work in the following way:

1. User will start laser mapping application

2. They then choose a measurement mode - either surface mapping, volume mapping, planar surface mapping or curved surface mapping

3. GPS, Wifi, cellular data and motion detector establish coordinates of iPhone position. 

4. Laser is turned on and gathers data as it is moved across the surface.

5. User can input additional data using the laser as required until a map can be generated

6. App generates image of map created on display. This can be stored or transmitted to other devices.

Designs for the iPhone laser were revealed in a US patent application submitted by Apple.

It raises the prospect of being able to connect future generations of the iPhone to 3D printers so users can replicate their favourite objects or important components.

Apple claims the laser technology could be incorporated into other handheld devices such as iPads, laptops and even wearable technology like its new Apple Watch.

Writing in the patent, Apple said: 'Conventional laser measuring devices measure only the distance from the device to a given surface.

'These devices are unable to measure distances between multiple points that are separate from the device and therefore require the user to place the device is specific locations for which measurements are desired.

'This can be difficult in, for example, a furnished room with items that restrict access to all parts of the room.

'Additionally, these devices can be bulky pieces of equipment that require batteries or battery packs and must be purchased and transported separately from other equipment and electronic devices.

'It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved electronic devices with mapping circuitry.'

Apple proposes housing the laser and sensor inside an iPhone, giving it a dedicated opening in the case to allow the laser beam to be emitted and received.

However, it says the laser system could also be mounted behind the camera, the display or even inside the port for headphone jacks.

The laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the iPhone, allowing it to measure the distance from an object.

iPhone users may be able to build up maps of their surroundings simply by pointing their phone at them

The iPhone laser will be able to map surroundings by precisely measuring the distance to nearby walls

The laser mapping could be used in a handheld device thanks to the iPhone's existing positioning hardware

The laser system works by measuring the time it takes for the light to be reflected back to the sensor mounted in the iPhone, allowing it to measure the distance from an object.

It can also build up a picture of the texture of the surface it is pointed at by looking at the amount of light that is scattered. 

Similar systems have been used to produce 3D maps of buildings such as the Houses of Parliament in London while paleontologists have adapted the technology to produce maps of dinosaur tracks.

However, these devices need to be mounted in a single spot for hours on end to build up a detailed image.

Apple proposes allowing its users to do the same with handheld phones by using the laser in combination with its GPS and data from the iPhone's motion sensors. 

It said: 'For example, a user may stand in a room and aim a laser beam generated by the laser sensor at a wall. 

'The user may gather laser sample data while pointing the laser at first, second, and third points on the wall. The user can freely move the device between sample points.

Apple's proposed laser technology could see some popular public areas like musuems looking more like night clubs as iPhone owners attempt to scan everything in sight with the sophisticated mapping system

'As the user moves the device, the positioning circuitry monitors the position and orientation of the device. 

'When the user gathers laser sample data at the second and third sample points, the positioning circuitry can determine the relative position and orientation of the device with respect to the position and orientation of the device during the first sample point measurement or with respect to a global coordinate system established at the outset of mapping operations.'

While such technology will be useful for professionals like architects, builders and even estate agents, it could find wider uses among the general public.

It would be possible to provide instant dimensions of an object to online buyers, for example.

Householders could use it to map their room and work out where new items of furniture may fit.

The technology could also help Apple to build up more detailed street level views for its map application by uploading scans performed by users. 

Apple's patent says the laser mapping could appear in iPhones and wearable technology like the Apple watch

The system could also be used in combination with 3D printing to allow users to produce replicas of a favourite toy or an important piece of equipment.

However, such technology may result in museums and other public venues having to ban eager Apple fans from scanning everything in sight. 

According to website Patently Apple, the full potential of the laser technology will become clear as the company submits more patents for its devices.

It said: 'More than likely Apple will expand upon this invention in the future so as to provide us with more insight as to how consumers will be able to take advantage of this new laser beam system for iDevices that cover everything from an iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. 

'While Apple is careful to not mention the word 3D, the nature of the measurements would suggest that the data collected in three axis mode would create a 3D model.

'It's definitely one of Apple's most interesting inventions of the year.'
