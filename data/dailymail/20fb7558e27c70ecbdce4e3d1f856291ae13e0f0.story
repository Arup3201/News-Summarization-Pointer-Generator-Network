Firutia Vasile, 29, has been dubbed the 'benefits teacher' after claiming more than £28,000 and passing information on how she did it to her friends and family in Romania

Living as a Romanian immigrant in the UK, Big Issue seller Firuta Vasile sparked outrage when she won the legal right to claim more than £28,000 in benefits.

Now the 29-year-old mother of four has become such an expert at claiming state handouts that she is helping her friends in Romania apply.

Yesterday it emerged that Miss Vasile – dubbed ‘the benefits teacher’ by her friends – is encouraging some of her former neighbours to move to the UK.

Her best friend Nadia Porojan, 29, spoke of her desire to follow in her footsteps.

Mrs Porojan travelled to England in 2012 when she was pregnant so that she could give birth to her third child Shakira in an NHS hospital that August.

Proudly clutching her daughter’s birth certificate, she said: ‘Firuta told me it would be better to give birth in the UK rather than Romania as it would be easier to claim benefits in the future.

‘When I first went to England I went to ask for benefits. Firuta told me than that in about a year or so everyone can apply for them.

‘And she was the one who could help me and was the one who put in a kind word in the right place. She is helping so many people as she is richer than many others.

‘She knew everything there. She is my benefits teacher. She knew where to go and how to ask for benefits for the children and for the house or for other needs.

'If I had 500 lei (£100) for a bus ticket I would go to the UK right after New Year’s Eve. But I don’t have the money yet, so I’m saving up.

'Sometimes Firuta sends me money and if she does it again soon I can start living my new life in England with the benefits money.’

Mrs Porojan lives with her husband Marian, 30, and their three children in a rural Roma community in the outskirts of Fetesti, a city in the south-east of the country.

She receives £8 a month through child support benefit in Romania. Her husband earns a small amount of money by selling scrap metal. They also receive the regular payments from Miss Vasile, who sends part of her UK benefits payments to them.

Nadia Porojan, Firuta's best friend, is hoping to join her in the UK after receiving lessons in how to claim

After giving birth to her daughter in Manchester in August 2012, Mrs Porojan wandered the streets begging for money, using her newborn baby in a bid to garner sympathy.

Having left her husband, son Alexe, three, and daughter Denisa, six, behind in Fetesti, Mrs Porojan lived on state handouts with other Romanian migrants in Oldham.

However she returned to Romania when her mother-in-law Angela became ill.

This time she wants to take her entire family with her to live in Oldham.

Mrs Porojan said: ‘I want to go back to the UK to get the benefits for my children. The British system is helping poor people. I have nothing here.

On the advice of Firuta, Nadia travelled to the UK last August in order to make sure her daughter was born here as it would make it easier to get state handouts

Her daughter was born in August in Manchester, near Oldham where the family hopes to move

‘Look how I am living. I have some potatoes on the shelf as food for my children and only a couple of days of wood for heating. This is no place to bring up children. Most of my neighbours would love to go to Britain because you can be rich there.

‘At least my little Shakira is a British citizen. This will really help us. I’m really looking forward to bringing them all up in Oldham.’

Miss Vasile’s case caused a furore in 2012 when a judge overruled Bristol Council and awarded her housing benefit worth at least £2,600 a year.

She had already qualified for around £25,500 in benefits by then. At the time she said the benefits money would help her pay rent on her £130,000 three-bedroom home in Bristol, while she continued to earn around £100 a week selling copies of The Big Issue on the street.

Firuta was claiming around £25,500 a year in benefits until 2012 when a judge ruled that she could claim an extra £2,600 in housing benefit

Any Romanian or Bulgarian citizen can now come and work in the UK under EU law

As fears continue to grow over the number of new migrants who are expected in the UK, a Romanian official spoke of his concern over the ‘invasion of people’ who will travel to Western Europe.

Daniel Teau, the president of the Federation of Romanian associations in Europe, said: ‘According to our estimations, based on the number of Romanians who have left the country during 2007 to 2012, around 30,000 to 50,000 will leave the country every month to travel to Western Europe from January.

'The invasion of people who will take advantage of the benefits system in those counties is imminent.

‘I’m warning the Romanian authorities to take the necessary measures to prevent the imminent exodus of Roma people into Northern Europe.

‘We ask the Romanian government to send police officers to these countries to prevent the crimes of the Roma gangs who are already in these countries, or those who will travel there.’
