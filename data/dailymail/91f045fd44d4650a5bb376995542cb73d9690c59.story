An Indianapolis grandmother stood up to a bunch of teenage would-be car thieves by refusing to give them the keys to her minivan.

Kay Kise, 67, had just arrived home and was just getting out of her car when three black males approached her. 

One of the teens asked her for directions and then pulled a gun on her.

One tough lady: Kay Kise,  a 67-year-old grandmother is recovering from serious facial injures after she says she refused to give in to three young men who tried to steal her van on Sunday night

Blatent: She had been doing some Christmas shopping and was just getting out of her van when three males, about 16 years old, approached her asking for directions - after which he pulled a gun on her

While gathering her belongings, a teenager approached Mrs Kise outside her van.

'He come up to my car and he said, 'Do you know where Hendricks Place is?'' said Mrs Kise. 

'I told him it was just two blocks over and continued grabbing my shopping bags. The next thing you know, I turned back around and he had this gun right in my face,' she told WTHR. 

Mrs Kise now believes the question was simply a distraction as two other men were walking down the street at the same time as the assault. 

'You are not getting the keys to my car.' she recalled. 'I shook that gun out of my face and I said, 'You are not taking my car. I haven't had it that long and you're not getting it.'   

The attack happened around 7pm on Sunday night.

Badly hurt: The teen suspect bashed Kise in the side of her head, knocking her dizzy. She fell into her van with the sliding back door still open. The next thing she knew, she was sitting in the back seat

Survivor: She's not sure how many times she was hit, but she has several facial fractures, bleeding on her brain and her left eye is swollen shut

After being approached by the teens there was a brief struggle when Mrs Kise was hit several times over her head. 

The next moment, the teen suspect bashed her in the side of her head, knocking her back into her van.

One of the assailants brought out a silver gun, shoved it in her face, demanded the keys to her van and pistol whipped her.

The next thing she knew, she was sitting in the back seat. Her head was throbbing and starting to bleed and swell, but, she was still holding her keys.

The bruises appear to be quite severe but fortunately she does not remember getting hit. 

A next door neighbor heard Mrs Kay's screams and called 911 but by the time officers arrived the three would-be thieves were long gone. 

Paramedics were called and Mrs Kise was taken to hospital so that doctors could treat her eye and face injuries.

On the lookout: Mrs Kise hopes the thieves will be caught. She doesn't regret her decision to say 'no' to the would-be carjackers.

She's not sure how many times she was hit, but she has several facial fractures, bleeding on her brain and her left eye is swollen shut. 

Still, she doesn't regret her decision to say 'no' to the would-be carjackers.

'I know it's just a vehicle, but it's the only thing I've got,' Mrs Kise said. 'And I don't have no money to buy another one with. So they weren't going to take it from me.'

'I wasn't about to let no young punk take my car,' Mrs Kise said.

Looking back, she cannot understand what motivated the attack against her.

'I don't hurt nobody,' she said. 'I don't understand why the children would hurt me.' 

The 67-year-old hopes someone will help bring her attackers to justice.
