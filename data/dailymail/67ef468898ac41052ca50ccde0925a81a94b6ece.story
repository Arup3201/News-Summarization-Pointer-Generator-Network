Prince Harry joined a host of celebrities at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix today, looking relaxed as he shared a joke with long-term friend of the royals Geri Halliwell. 

The 30-year-old watched from the Infiniti Red Bull enclosure as Britain's Lewis Hamilton qualified for tomorrow's world title race following a whirlwind tour of the Middle East.

Harry, who was seen in Oman days earlier at one of the country's most holy mosques, was seen laughing and pointing with the former pop star during the event.

While Harry looked intent on focusing on the races, the former spice girl removed her headphones on several occasions to turn and share a joke. 

Days earlier, Miss Halliwell and her fiancé Christian Horner turned out to support the royal at Sentebale Polo Cup. 

German Nico Rosberg finished in pole position today after beginning the weekend 17-points behind Britain's Lewis Hamilton. 

Both drivers belong to the Mercedes Formula One team.

Today's qualifying race was littered with celebrities including singer Pharrell Williams and actress Michelle Rodriguez. 

Earlier in the day, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone was seen wrapping his arms around Hamilton in preparation for the race. 

On Thursday Prince Harry shunned photographers at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club where he arrived late to a charity match.

The royal quickly changed into a pair of white jeans and team shirt before taking time out to speak with Sheikh Falah bin Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, and his young son.

Miss Halliwell, who is engaged to Formula One Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, first met the 30-year-old when he was just 10 after being introduced by his father, the Prince of Wales. 

'I have met Prince Harry a few times,' said on Thursday. 

'I've seen him since he was about 10. I have seen him grow up. It is brilliant what he is doing with his life.

'It's all for a good cause. I think he is a great ambassador for showing people that we care and he's got great spirit and heart. 

'I think he's brilliant. We are looking forward to serving him in action.'

The singer also revealed that she has been on a polo pony before and described them as 'amazing'. 'I want to say like a Ferrari...' she said, before sheepishly trailing off.

Miss Halliwell also chatted to singer Pharrel Williams backstage at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi today 

The stars were among crowds at Yas Marina cheering on Lewis Hamilton as he qualified for tomorrow's world title championship
