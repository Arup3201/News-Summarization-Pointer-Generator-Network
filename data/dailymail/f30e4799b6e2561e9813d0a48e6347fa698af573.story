You don't normally expect to be in the middle of a scrum at an event in aid of a charity. A nightclub or student disco maybe, but not at a charity ball.

But that's exactly what happened to me this week – when I attended a ball in aid of the NSPCC at the Hurlingham Club in Chelsea. 

The very genteel Hurlingham Club is one of the most beautiful sports clubs in the country, built in 42 acres of the most prime real estate in the world, just south of Chelsea down near the river, but I didn't realise what the exact nature of the event was at first.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The trick for this would be to thoroughly read the invite, as it was clearly stated that this was a ball for under 16s.

But I rarely read the instructions on anything, so it came as a bit of a surprise when I walked through the door and I was surrounded by about 200 very excitable young women, all of whom wanted a selfie.

Everywhere I went there was a cluster of well-spoken girls in Little Black Dresses waving smartphones at me.

You can see from the video below the sort of numbers in the herd of young girls. What is the collective noun for a group of teenage girls? A 'giggle' of girls I believe.

Clearly I was more than happy to accommodate as they all asked very politely but it felt like I was lost at sea with the crowd choosing where I went.

For health and safety reasons the organisers ended up putting me in a specially designed London taxi which had been converted into a photo booth, and it seemed like an hour passed by having girls (and occasionally some boys) ushered in and out of the taxi.

But deep down I loved the attention – and they were all really charming and polite, I simply couldn't refuse and I think it's fair to say that anyone who asked for an picture got one, and in some cases five or six.

And of course the most important thing was the event raised over £20,000 for the very good cause of the NSPCC, protecting vulnerable children all over the UK, and preventing abuse.
