Lunch with Jack Nicklaus last Sunday and dinner with Arnold Palmer on Thursday night. Rory McIlroy is certainly mixing with the right company as he finalises his preparations for his tilt at the career Grand Slam at the Masters next month.

Not just the greats of this sport, either. While on a two-day trip to Augusta last week, the Northern Irishman hit the gym at 6am — and was joined shortly afterwards by Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.

‘When they came in it was my cue to walk out,’ said McIlroy, smiling. ‘When you think it’s their off-season, it was quite something to see their dedication. They’re both in their late 30s and it emphasised their determination to prolong their careers.’

Amazing what a pep trip to Augusta can do for a man — that, and a long weekend practice session with his long-time coach, Michael Bannon. When last seen at the Cadillac Championship at Doral 10 days ago McIlroy cut a dispirited figure as he completed the second of two disappointing tournaments in Florida. Here at Bay Hill, on the eve of his first appearance at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, there was a spring to his stride once more.

‘I certainly feel a lot better about my game than I did at Doral,’ he said. ‘And I think this course sets up well for me. Practising the last two days has left me ruing the fact I haven’t played here in the past.’

The accent was clearly on relaxation rather than reconnaissance when McIlroy took his dad Gerry, a former scratch handicap player himself, up to Augusta last Thursday.

‘I think it gave him an appreciation of what it takes to play the course off the back tees,’ said Rory. ‘He’s always asking me why I did this and that when I come off the course. Now I think he knows what we go through.’ 

McIlroy was coy when asked about his score, noting merely that he played well on the first day. Which probably means a 64 or 65.

This is his last scheduled tournament before the Masters in three weeks and, in the absence of eight-time winner Tiger Woods, the local community is certainly glad he’s here.

‘Welcome Rory,’ proclaims a huge sign hanging from a house near the 18th green. ‘It was very nice of them to do that and it summed up the reception I’ve had since I’ve arrived,’ said the 25-year-old.

McIlroy begins on Thursday in a belter of a threeball alongside good friend Rickie Fowler and another of Augusta’s highly-fancied players — gifted Australian Jason Day.

Also in the field are  world No 3 Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott, and among the British and Irish contingent are Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell, Paul Casey, Danny Willett and Padraig Harrington.

As for that talk with the Golden Bear, McIlroy was asking about pin placements on certain greens when Nicklaus said: ‘Never forget, Rory — if you’re in doubt, the middle of the green is never a bad place to be at Augusta.’

For a player who has certainly been guilty of playing too aggressively on occasion in the past that might prove the most sage piece of advice of all.
