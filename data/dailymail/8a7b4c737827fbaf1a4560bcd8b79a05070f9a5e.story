Allegations: Sir Cyril Smith is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse young boys with impunity at Knowl View School in Rochdale

Police are set to launch a criminal investigation into an alleged cover-up of child abuse at a school linked to Sir Cyril Smith.

The
 Lib Dem politician, who died aged 82 in 2010, is alleged to have used 
his status to sexually abuse scores of young boys with impunity at Knowl View 
School in Rochdale.

But despite repeated complaints by his victims and previous police inquiries, he and others have never been prosecuted.

A separate investigation is ongoing to identify suspects who actually took part in the alleged sexual abuse.

Now, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) are set to investigate whether their own 
officers and local politicians were part of a cover-up of what was going 
on at the time.

The latest inquiry was sparked by Labour’s
 Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who claimed in a recently published book that
 Smith raped a number of young 
boys at the residential school.

Police,
 spies and politicians helped to hide the historical child abuse carried
 out by Smith, according to Mr Danczuk’s book, Smile For The Camera: The
 Double Life Of Cyril Smith.

This left the
 29-stone former Rochdale MP free to abuse children as young as eight 
despite 144 complaints by victims, Mr Danczuk and co-author Matthew 
Baker said.

Today, Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett, of GMP, said: 'Following the publication of MP Simon Danzcuk’s book "Smile for the Camera", GMP conducted an assessment of the allegations contained within that book.

'As a result of the assessment, GMP decided that a criminal investigation was required.

'The GMP investigation will now seek to identify whether any offences have been committed in the way that previous reports of abuse were handled or allegedly covered up.

'The main concerns relate to the response to child abuse over several decades connected to Knowl View School in Rochdale.

'We have consulted with the Home Office in relation to the national inquiry that has been announced into how organisations responded to child abuse, but as these matters relate to criminal allegations in the GMP area, the responsibility to investigate them falls to the Chief Constable.'

Mr Wiggett said that the allegations relating to the past involvement of police officers have been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

He added: 'In addition, we have established an independent oversight panel to demonstrate the independence and rigour of the investigation that we will be conducting.

'If there are further allegations that relate to the conduct of police officers, these will similarly be referred to the IPCC, as we are required to do.'

Fourteen
 suspects have been questioned as part of the inquiry into alleged sexual offences committed at 
Knowl View School between 1969 
and 1990.

The claims relate to the alleged abuse of pupils by both adults at the residential school and among the boys themselves.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that prosecutors ruled there was a realistic chance of convicting Smith of child sex offences 12 years before he died.

But they advised against bringing a case because the politician had been assured decades earlier that he would not face charges.

Documents made public also revealed that police knew of three potential witnesses to Smith’s abuse but failed to interview them.

Lancashire Police first investigated Smith in 1969 over complaints that he abused eight teenage boys at a hostel in Rochdale.

But the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Norman Skelhorn, rejected the case, ruling the following year that the allegations were ‘somewhat stale’ and ‘completely without corroboration’.

In 1998 the Crown Prosecution Service was asked to review the original file of evidence.

Peter Watson, Crown prosecutor for Rochdale, noted in his ruling at the time that the alleged victims living in the hostel all complained of ‘virtually the same type of indecent misconduct’ and had given consistent accounts.

He concluded: ‘I have arrived at the firm view, having regard in particular to the number and nature of the complaints and how they came to be made, that there would be a realistic prospect of conviction.'

But shockingly, the prosecutor went on to recommend against charging Smith because police had told him back in March 1970 that he would not face further action.

Today, Mr Danczuk said: 'I welcome the fact that GMP are taking what’s in our book seriously. It is clear to me that crimes have been committed, though I hope the police will prioritise the arrests of abusers who are still alive over whether council officers covered this up.

'That is what the victims have told me is their priority. They want to see those who inflicted terrible abuse on innocent children brought to justice.'
