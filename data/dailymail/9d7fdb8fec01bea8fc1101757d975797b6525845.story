Canadian climber Will Gadd has become the first man to ever climb the frozen ice of Niagara Falls.

As the popular tourist area experiences such heavy ice in winter, it is closed to the public. 

Gadd, 47, already world-renowned for his feats, used the opportunity to take on the ice of the iconic 180-foot high wonder of nature, working his way up just feet away from the Horseshoe Falls.

Inch by inch: Gadd, 47, already world-renowned for his feats, used the opportunity to take on the ice of the 180-foot high gorge working his way up just feet away from the Horseshoe Falls

Once a year the falls on the Canadian and US border freezes. As the popular tourist area experiences such heavy ice in winter, it is closed to the public.

The climb was captured by media and events company owner Bob Koshinski, CBS reports. 

'I grew up in Niagara Falls and I've seen Wallenda and I've seen some of the great stunts and I have been down here for many functions,' Koshinski told reporters.

'I have never seen anybody, certainly in the wintertime, scaling the gorge so close to the cascades of the Horseshoe Falls that he could have reached out and touched it,' he said. 'It was pretty dramatic footage.'

Victory: There is estimated to be about 150,000 tons of water pouring out over the park's crest with speeds reaching as high as 70 miles per hour

Red Bull also filmed the climb.

'I've traveled the world in search of the most challenging climbs, but Niagara Falls, one of my home country's most iconic landmarks, has been a lifelong mission that I previously never thought possible,' Gadd said, The Daily News reports.

There is estimated to be about 150,000 tons of water pouring out over the park's crest with speeds reaching as high as 70 miles per hour.

There was some confusion around Gadd's climb, as the New York State Parks Office approved it but the Niagra Falls Review reported it as 'U .S. law enforcement conducted training exercises'

A State Parks spokeswoman said 'no park staff was told to lie' but that the information about the stunt was not widely spread to keep filming quiet'

'It was very real on that wall. There's a lot going on,' Gadd said. 'The ice thickness varies from one inch to 10 feet, so every swing and grab is different. There's a lot to account for, all this with the world's most powerful waterfall flowing over my shoulder.'
