The horrifying moment an American football fan kicked another supporter full in the face has been caught on camera.

Footage of the sickening act was posted to YouTube on Wednesday, with the description for the clip explaining that the incident happened during an Arizona State versus Arizona game at the Sun Devil Stadium.

The beginning of the clip shows a man dressed in a blue top arguing animatedly with a student beneath him.

Shocking: A student is kicked in the face by another fan at an Arizona State versus Arizona game

He then lashes out and kicks the student in the face, but doesn't appear to hurt him seriously.

However, the student wears an understandable look of horror and in the remaining few seconds of the clip there are a flurry of punches.

The ensuing chaos is such that the person filming quickly decides to stop and the footage fades to black.

Heated debate: The footage begins with a grey-haired man in a blue top arguing with a student (right)

Mayhem: After the kick several punches are thrown and one person attempts to restrain the man in the blue top

Question marks: It's not known whether anyone was arrested following the flare-up

The
 game at the Tempe stadium finished with Arizona State the clear victors
 - but what isn't clear is precisely what caused the violence caught on camera.

It has been alleged, though, that the blue-topped man instigated the furore.

One source told TMZ Sports: 'The old man was yelling at some undergrads and some girls. He was told to "shut his mouth".'

'The old man took offense. He kicked. He then got what he deserved. He was destroyed.'

Comments on one website indicate that the man in the blue top was subsequently arrested and TMZ's source claimed he was ejected from the stadium, but this isn't something that MailOnline has verified.
