When the newly-appointed chief of the CIA offers to marry you in exchange to help him cash a few pay cheques he earned from the recent campaign that toppled the Gaddafi regime, who wouldn't jump at the chance?

One Taiwanese engineer grasped the opportunity with both hands and as well as wiring her 'fiancé' $30,000, she also managed to get herself arrested.

Liu Hsu-jen claims she was contacted by a man claiming to be the newly sworn-in Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David Petraeus on the Internet four months ago.

Marriage?: General David Patraeus, who was sworn in as CIA chief on September 6, is said to have been impersonated in a Skype scam

The married general asked for the engineer's hand, vowing to marry her, 'even if it will start World War III'.

He then promised that he would fly to Taipei to fetch his new bride on a U.S. military plane and bring her back to the U.S. All she had to do was wire him the $30,000 to help for fuel expenses.

He then sent her a wedding ring and 37 Citibank travellers' cheques worth 500 euros each, which he said he received from 'the recent campaign that toppled the Col Gaddafi of Libya' - even though the U.S. was not largely involved in the military campaigns in Libya.

And also the small matter that General Petraeus is married.

Scam: Thumbs up for marriage

When Miss Hsu-jen went to cash the cheques it emerged they were forgeries and she was promptly arrested.

She explained to authorities that they had come from her fiancé David Howell Petraeus and that though she had her doubts at the beginning of their 'relationship' she was assured of his validity after an online video conference with him.

According to The China Post, footage of the web conferences showed a
man with a striking resemblance to Petraeus.

Miss Hsu-jen - who at this time already resigned from her post as a managing engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - said she then googled her fiancé and was confident that he was who he said he was and so wired the money. 

Gawker reported that there was a Skype scam doing the rounds where people had been contacted by a man pretending to be General Petraeus and asking them to send money or help him collect a parcel.

But despite the authorities and media telling the engineer that she was part of a scam, she refused to believe it and still insists that the love between her and the CIA boss is real.

'How could a scamming group have so much resources at its disposal?” she asked, adding that the man who claimed to be Petraeus was deliberately misleading the media into believing he was a scammer to keep cross-strait issues calm and 'protect their love', according to the Taipei Times.

She also said that if CNN interviewed her, it would force her fiancé to 'come to Taiwan sooner'.

Police in Hsinchu sent several officers to visit Miss Hsu-jen to try to persuade her that she was the victim of an international scam and that the man’s professed 'love' was in fact a way of conning her out of her savings.

However she refused to believe it and is currently trying to raise money on Facebook so that her 'true love' can come to Tapei to get her as promised.

She is currently out on bail.
