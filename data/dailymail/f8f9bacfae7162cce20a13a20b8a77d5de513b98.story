Homeland has continued to ruffle feathers across the globe, after a scene in the season finale sparked outrage in Israel by comparing former prime minister Menachem Begin to a fictional Taliban leader.

Just days after the Pakistani government hit out at the U.S. series over its portrayal of the country, Israelis have sharply criticized the television show and demanded an explanation for the comparison.

The offending scene involved a conversation between CIA agent Dar Adal and former CIA director Saul Berenson, a Jewish character played by Mandy Patinkin.

The pair are discussing the possibility of protecting fictional Afghan Taliban leader, Haissam Haqqani,  in order to ensure that he will not give political asylum to terrorists.

Berenson describes Haqqani as a terrorist who 'recently killed 36 Americans'. 

Adal responds: 'Menachem Begin killed 91 British soldiers at the King David hotel before he became prime minister.'

The Homeland CIA agent was referring to a bombing at the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 that was carried out by the Irgun, a right-wing militant Jewish  organization which was headed by Menachem Begin. 

Herzl Makov, head of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem told Israeli news site Ynet, that the statement was: 'Slander against Menachem Begin and Israel'.

Menachem Begin (right), the commander of the Irgun - a right-wing Jewish extremist group - speaks to activists in 1948. The group was responsible for the attack on the King David Hotel two years earlier.

He said: 'To say that Menachem Begin killed? He wasn't there. The underground organization was under his command and he took responsibility. 

'Additionally, during the incident, three warnings were given to the British to evacuate the place. The British commander refused.' 

On July 22, 1946, the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was attacked by right-wing Jewish organization the Irgun.

A total of 91 people of various nationalities - including 28 Britons - were killed and 46 injured.

The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine.

Bombing is regarded historically as a contributing factor to the British mandate’s decline.

The attack remains highly controversial, and there has been heated debate over when warnings were sent and how British authorities responded. 

Menachem Begin began his political career as head of Irgun, where he was commander from 1943 to 1948.

He added: 'Therefore, there is a dramatic difference between the two incidents that were compared. As far as I'm concerned, it is just like saying that they are both terrorists because they wore brown shirts.' 

The attack on the King David Hotel remains a highly controversial topic, as there has been heated debate over when warnings were sent and how British authorities responded.

Menachem Begin began his political career as head of Irgun, where he was commander from 1943 until the group disbanded in 1948.

He went on to  become Israel’s sixth prime minister in 1977 and received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat after an unprecedented peace treaty between the two countries in 1979.

The fresh Homeland controversy comes after the Pakistani government hit out at the television series over its portrayal of the country as a safe haven for Islamic terrorists.

Diplomats condemned producers for depicting Islamabad, the setting of the show's fourth series, as a 'hellhole' refuge for the Taliban.

Complaining to Showtime which airs the Emmy-winning show in the United States, one official described it as a 'disservice to the people of the US'.

The fourth series follows Carrie Matheson as she fights terrorism on behalf of the CIA in Islamabad

The fourth series of the popular show sees star Claire Danes acting as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency in Islamabad. 

Filmed in fact in Cape Town, the first episode sees a violent mob of local people beating another agent to death over a drone strike which killed a sought-after terrorist hiding in a rural farmhouse.

'Maligning a country that has been a close partner and ally of the US... is a disservice not only to the security interests of the US but also to the people of the US,' Pakistan Embassy spokesman Nadeem Hotiana told the New York Post. 

The Pakistani directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence has been widely accused of hosting and assisting terrorist activity in the past. 

Based in Islamabad, doubt was cast over the ISI in 2011 upon the news of Osama Bin Laden's execution by U.S. forces. 

How, it was asked, could the government not have known the world's most wanted terrorist was taking refuge in a rural compound some 30 miles from its headquarters? 

Following his assassination, Adm Mike Mullen, then the most senior U.S. military officer, said Pakistan had a 'long-standing relationship' with Afghan insurgents. 

It has been claimed the directorate differentiates between terrorists committed to corrupting Pakistan and those whose interest lie abroad, with Afghan officials describing the country's handling of terrorism as 'double gamed'. 

In September a new chief was appointed to lead the ISI, Rizwan Akhtar.  

'Islamabad is a quiet, picturesque city with beautiful mountains and lush greenery. 

'In Homeland it's portrayed as a grimy hellhole and war zone where shootouts and bombs go off with dead bodies scattered around. Nothing is further from the truth,' another added.

'Repeated insinuations that an intelligence agency of Pakistan is complicit in protecting the terrorists... is not only absurd but also an insult to the ultimate sacrifices of the thousands of Pakistani security personnel in the war against terrorism.' 

This week the Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif spoke of the country's need to persecute terrorists following an attack on a school in Peshawar which saw Taliban fundamentalists massacre 132 children. 

Describing the incident as a 'national tragedy', he lifted a moratorium on the death penalty as a result of the attack. 

In previous years however the government has been widely accused of colluding with terrorists in recent years, with repeated claims officials helped 9/11 orchestrator Osama Bin Laden evade capture.

Among those convinced the country had a hand in protecting the terrorist is Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Carlotta Gall who spent more than a decade reporting in Pakistan. 

'Pakistan did know. They were hiding him, they were handling him. Someone on the inside told me this,' she told ABC news this year. 

Upon news of the terrorist's death in 2011, a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman confirmed the killing but, unlike foreign counterparts, offered no congratulation to U.S forces. 

'In an intelligence driven operation, Osama bin Laden was killed in the surroundings of Abbotabad in the early hours of this morning. 

'This operation was conducted by the U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world,' a statement said.  

Menachem Begin  went on to become Israel’s sixth prime minister in 1977 and received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Egyptian president Anwar Sadat after an unprecedented peace treaty between the two countries

In 2012, a leaked NATO report revealed concerns officials had been assisting the Taliban from the heart of Islamabad. 

Among testimonies given by al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees in thousands of interviews, one senior fanatic condemned: 'Pakistan knows everything. They control everything.

'The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad.'

Speaking of the report at the time, then Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said: 'We have long been concerned about ties between elements of the ISI [Pakistan's intelligence service] and some extremist networks.' 

Pakistani government officials dismissed detainees' claims as 'ridiculous' at the time.
