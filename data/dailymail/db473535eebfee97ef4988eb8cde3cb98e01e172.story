Supermarkets are on alert for pranksters attempting to copy an American craze known as 'gallon smashing', after one teenager was arrested for the stunt last week.

The prank involves a youngster walking into a crowded shop, before slamming a large carton of milk into the ground and lying down. Store workers are tricked into thinking there has been an accident. An accomplice meanwhile films the incident and posts the video online.

One such incident, titled 'Gallon Smashing Prank, UK Edition' has already attracted 1.12million viewers after it was posted online.

An American version showing three teenagers performing the prank, went viral earlier this year.

There are now fears the fad has gained popularity on this side of the Atlantic, with police in Kent confirming they have attended calls on 'gallon smashing' incidents.

Last week, a teenager pulled the messy stunt in a Poundland store in Canterbury.

But the practical joke turned sour when staff called the police and the culprit was reprimanded.

One shopper, who hinted on Twitter that they witnessed the incident, said: 'Children in this city are out of control. I hate them all. What is wrong with them?

'When I finished a term at school, I went straight home to change into my own clothes. These days, kids want to terrorise retail staff.

'They're all stealing things and throwing bottles of milk around.'

A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed they had dealt with the incident which 'involved a container of milk'.

He said: 'Police were called to a shop in St George's Street, Canterbury, at around 5.20pm on March 28 after staff reported a disturbance involving a container of milk.

'A boy in his teens was spoken to and investigations are ongoing.'Â

One youngster thought to be involved in the prank, tweeted: 'Gonna gallon smash in Poundland,' before later posting the message, 'Biggest mistake ever'.

A spokeswoman for Poundland declined to comment.

While the latest gallon smashing prank has already garnered 1.12million views, the original American video has gained 1.14million views since it was uploaded in February.

In the US version, three brothers walk around grocery stores holding two gallon-sized containers of milk or 
juice and theatrically slip, while at the same time 
throwing the cartons in the air.

Once
the inevitable mess is made, the teenagers then have to navigate the 
awkward attentions of fellow customers as they offer help and express concern at what looks like a nasty accident.

While some have enjoyed the slapstick humour, brothers Omar, Faysal, and Zayd Khatib, have also come under fire for the three-minute film, as fears of copycat behaviour surfaced.

After the video was posted in February, the
popular Animal NY blog posted a plea to repeat pranksters: 'Enjoy this 
for what it is, and don't make more of these.

'We
don't need a CNN report two weeks from now about how this new fad 
called gallon smashing is very dangerous ('This Florida teenager slipped
and suffered a leg contusion, missing two days of school!'), complete 
with man-on-the-street interviews of senior citizens dressing down the 
current generation of dumb kids.

'Sometimes
a video of dumb kids spiking milk jugs can just be a video of dumb kids
spiking milk jugs, and we can appreciate it then move on.'

The prank is now complete as the juice burst everywhere onto the floor - potentially causing danger for the innocent bystander out for their groceries
