Posing with her hand on her swollen stomach, Lyn Perrett joked about being nine months pregnant.

But the 53-year-old's smile masked her concern.

She had been through the menopause, and was suffering pains in her stomach. 

Concerned, Mrs Perrett, from Solihull in the West Midlands, visited her doctor, and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

But when medication, cutting out wheat and dairy from her diet, and colonic irrigation failed to ease her symptoms, she returned to see another doctor.

Lyn Perrett, 53, became concerned last year when her stomach began to bloat and she suffered pains. After visiting her doctor she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). But after months of trying various treatments her stomach started to get bigger and bigger 

Mrs Perrett was referred to see a specialist, who performed an ultrasound. It revealed a giant cyst in her womb. 

While performing a full hysterectomy, surgeons removed a growth the size of a rugby ball.

It was at a follow-up appointment that specialists told Mrs Perrett the mass had been cancerous, diagnosing her with a rare but life-threatening Fallopian tube cancer.

Mrs Perrett, told MailOnline: 'I'd gone through the menopause a few years before and thought I was done with all the bloating and discomfort. Then I started getting pains in my tummy.'  

Visiting her doctor in January 2013, company director Mrs Perrett was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, a common digestive complaint. 

Looking up solutions online, she did all she could to help curb the distressing symptoms; cutting out wheat and dairy and taking medication to settle her belly.

She even tried colonic irrigation, which seemed to soothe her symptoms.

However, after about a month of respite, they returned with vengeance.

'My stomach was just getting bigger and bigger,' the mother-of-one said. 'I tried to laugh it off. 

'I even posed for a picture with my hand on my belly as if I was pregnant.

'Though I was worried and returned for another colonic as that had helped before.'

During the session, the nurse suggested Mrs Perrett's swollen stomach could be down to a cyst. 

It prompted her to get a crucial second opinion.

The second doctor was much more concerned at the sight of  her terribly swollen belly, immediately referring her to a specialist at the Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. 

An ultrasound revealed an ovarian cyst and Mrs Perrett was advised to have a full hysterectomy.

While waiting for surgery, her tummy continued to balloon.

'By then, I looked nine months pregnant,' she said. 

'I felt like I was pregnant, I walked like I was pregnant. I couldn't touch my toes and had to sit down to put my shoes on. The pain was excruciating too. Painkillers didn't touch the sides.

'One morning, I woke up and the agony was worse than giving birth. It took me 10 minutes to get down one stair.' 

Following her operation, doctors told the 53-year-old the cyst had been the size of a rugby ball.  

'There was no indication at all that the cyst was anything to worry about and, though a hysterectomy is a big operation, it wasn't like I could've had anymore kids anyway,' she told MailOnline. 

'I was left with an 11-inch scar and 40 metal staples holding it together.

Mrs Perrett, pictured before treatment left, and afterwards, right, sought a second opinion and was referred to a specialist. An ultrasound revealed a huge mass in her womb. Surgeons removed the cyst but tests revealed the lump was cancerous, diagnosing the 53-year-old with a rare fallopian tube cancer

Fallopian tube cancer is a rare form of the disease.

The fallopian tubes link the ovaries to the womb, carrying eggs from the to the womb. 

Only around one in 100 cancers of the female reproductive system are fallopian tube cancer. 

However many experts believe most high grade serious type ovarian cancers actually start in the far end of the fallopian tube, rather than on the surface of the ovary. 

It is most common in post-menopausal women.

Symptoms include: 

Scientists do not know what causes fallopian tube cancer, but if two or more of your very close relatives - your mother, sister or daughter - have had ovarian cancer, your risk may be increased.

Two genes have been linked to causing ovarian and fallopian tube cancer. They are the BRCA genes. Researchers believe the faulty BRCA gene may cause around 16 in 100 cancers or the fallopian tube.

The disease can be hard to diagnose, but doctors will routinely perform pelvic examinations, scans and blood tests.

As with ovarian cancer, surgeons will try to remove as much of the tumour as possible.

Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to try and stop the cancer from returning.

'But I just went home and tried to get on with my life, glad to be back in my normal clothes again without that swelling.'

But weeks on, during a check-up, doctors revealed that they had tested tissue taken from Mrs Perrett and discovered she had an incredibly rare Fallopian tube cancer.

She was then put through six sessions of chemotherapy last June to make sure the cancer did not return.

'I just got on with it and insisted on working all the way through my treatment,' she said. 

'The worst bit for me was losing my long blonde hair. I'd read about the symptoms I could expect but nothing prepares you for seeing your hair coming out in clumps. 

'It's one of the most devastating things a woman can go through. I lost my lashes and brows, too. I found myself a wig but thought there was nothing I could do about my facial hair.'

To her relief, Mrs Perrett discovered that she could have her eyebrows tattooed on, as well as semi-permanent eyeliner.

'It helped to shape my face and made me feel so much more confident,' she said.

'I wish more women knew about it. Just make sure you have it done before you start chemo in case of infection.'

Mrs Perrett is now in remission and attends the hospital for regular check-ups.

'People need to know that IBS symptoms can be the same as cancer and to make sure they don't get fobbed off by doctors,' she told MailOnline.

'I used to giggle about my baby bump but my little joke could have killed me. Looking back now, it's awful to think there was such a huge ticking time bomb inside me.

'If the cyst hadn't grown, I would've continued to think I had IBS and I wouldn't be here today.'
