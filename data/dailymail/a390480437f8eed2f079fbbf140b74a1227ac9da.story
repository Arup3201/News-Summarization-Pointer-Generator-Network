The 34-year-old, who will turn 35 the day after Toulon's Heineken Cup final against Saracens on Saturday, had been widely expected to retire afters reports to that effect emerged two months ago.

End of an era: Wilkinson announced on Monday that he will hang up his boots at the end of the season

'I would like to take this opportunity to formally announce my retirement from playing rugby,' he said. 

'It
 goes without saying that I have an enormous number of people to thank 
for their support from all around the world but especially here in 
France and in England.

 however is not at all the time to be concentrating on this as I would 
like to focus all my attention and energy on the team and these final 
two games of the season.

BRIAN MOORE @brianmoore666Jonny Wilkinson has announced his retirement - what a player; what a man.RIKI FLUTEY @rikifluteyAbsolute pleasure & honour to have played alongside @JonnyWilkinson. thanks for the memories & thanks for everything you have done for rugbyTOM MAY @TomMay1Rugby won’t be the same without @JonnyWilkinson Changed the game. Changed way kids tackle! You will be missed. Pleasure to play with you.

Wilkinson
 retires as one of just five men to score 1000 points in international 
rugby, with his 1246 second only to New Zealand great Dan Carter.

He
 made his debut for Newcastle in 1997 and stayed with them until 2009, 
winning the Tetleys Bitter Cup twice in that time. It was during his 
days with the Falcons that he came to the attention of then-England 
coach Sir Clive Woodward.

The duo would become central to the achievements of the Red Rose and the would enjoy unparallelled success together.

Wilkinson
 made his debut as an 18-year-old and, after a chastening experience on 
the 'Tour of Hell' to Australia, he won the 2000, 2001 and 2003 Six 
Nations, with those successes leading to Wilkinson's signature moment at
 the 2003 World Cup.

Back in the day: Wilkinson played for the Newcastle Falcons for 12 years before joining Toulon

Roar: Wilkinson played for the British and Irish Lions on two tours 

His
 metronomic boot kicked England to the final and then, against hosts 
Australia, he landed the most valuable three points of his life with a 
minute of extra-time left, earning his country a 20-17 victory. He ended
 the tournament with 113 points.

Injuries
 - often caused by his no-holds-barred approach to tackling - would set 
in after that and he was never able to be as dominant a force as he once
 was in the national shirt, but he still played a key role in taking 
England to the 2007 World Cup final, while he won the Six Nations in 
2011.

He
 retired from international rugby with 91 caps in December 2011, by 
which point he was already making a new career for himself in France.

Well-known
 as a perfectionist, Wilkinson took his distinctive kicking style to 
Toulon in 2009 and immediately became the fulcrum of their side. He won 
the Heineken Cup with them last season and this weekend can bow out with
 back-to-back victories in the competition.
