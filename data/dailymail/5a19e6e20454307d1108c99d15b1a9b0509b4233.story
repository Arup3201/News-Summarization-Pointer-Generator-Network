Judd Trump continued his good form by easing to a 4-0 victory over up-and-coming Belgium cueman Luca Brecel in the first round of the Players Championship in Thailand.

Trump, who defeated Ronnie O'Sullivan to win the World Grand Prix last Sunday before travelling to Bangkok, reached the last 16 with a top break of 71.

'I played well and Luca didn't, so in the end it was convincing,' Trump told worldsnooker.com. 'I need to play better next time.'

Shaun Murphy reeled off three frames in a row after going 1-0 down on his way to a 4-2 victory over Rod Lawler which included top breaks of 93 and 69.

Murphy said: 'Rod was unlucky today, on another day he might have won. I'm trying my best, I have won this title before and I'm trying to win it again.

'I always enjoy coming to Thailand, the people are very friendly and they love snooker.'
