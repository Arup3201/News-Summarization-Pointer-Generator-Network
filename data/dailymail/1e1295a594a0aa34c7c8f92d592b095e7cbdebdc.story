The widow of PC David Rathband who hanged himself after their marriage broke down has found love with a prison guard.

Kath, 44, whose former husband was blinded by gunman Raoul Moat, met the warder last year and is now living with him, it was reported today.

The mother-of-two's relationship with the unidentified man follows the collapse of her marriage to the traffic officer who committed suicide 20 months after he was blasted while on duty.

A friend told the Sunday Mirror: 'Everyone is just so pleased that Kath has managed to find someone and can try to get on with her life after the nightmare she has been through.'

Last month a coroner ruled that being shot and blinded by maniac Raoul Moat was the 'first step' in the series of events which led to Pc David Rathband killing himself.

The traffic officer who became a national hero grew desperate after the collapse of his marriage and struggled to cope with his sudden and irreversible disability.

He was found hanging at his home 20 months after he was blasted while on duty.

Moat hunted down his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend Chris Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham in 2010.

Ms Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC David Rathband.

Moat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself after a week on the run.

Coroner Eric Armstrong urged none of those involved in the hearing to blame themselves.

The inquest heard Mr Rathband, 44, had made threats to kill himself and told his lover he attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it.

But his widow Kath and police colleagues she alerted, while concerned for his well-being, did not consider him to be at immediate risk of suicide.

Mr Rathband was found hanging at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29 2012.

He lived there alone, having left the family home following a domestic dispute the previous August.

The three-day inquest, at Newcastleâ€™s Moot Hall, heard his wife put up with previous affairs, but his last - with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French - effectively ended the marriage.

Mrs Rathband broke the news to her husband prior to him flying out for a holiday in Australia with his identical twin Darren.

While on holiday, Mr Rathband made desperate attempts to contact his wife, ringing her up to 50 times on some days.

The messages were unpleasant, abusive and threatening, she told the hearing.

In one he pretended to be a police officer ringing to say her husband was dead.

But he would be rational and pleasant if she spoke to him directly, she told the hearing.

On another occasion he threatened to video-call his wife and kill himself while she watched.

Mrs Rathband visited him for the last time on the night he died.

She said she thought he looked 'awful' and decided he needed support.

But she felt she was not the right person to be with him and contacted his sister Debbie Essery in Staffordshire and his welfare officer Inspector John Heckles.

Mrs Essery contacted Det Con Brown with a Facebook message to pass on her concerns.

That evening, officers including Mr Heckles eventually broke into his home and found him hanging in the darkness, with music playing from his phone.
