A top BBC presenter has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Officers from Operation Yewtree have refused to name the suspect, 64, who still works at the BBC and is a household name.

The BBC, the suspect and his agent have all refused to confirm his identity.

The situation provoked a new row about
 so-called ‘secret arrests’. Critics say that refusing to name arrested 
suspects means innocent people are falsely linked to high-profile 
arrests by Yewtree officers.

And yesterday an innocent entertainer of the same age was widely named on the internet as the person who had been arrested.

But despite the potential damage to 
the man’s reputation, the Metropolitan Police and BBC both refused to 
confirm the identity of the man who had really been arrested.

Shami Chakrabarti, director of human 
rights group Liberty, criticised the decision not to publicise the 
star’s identity, saying it was ‘chilling for officers to refuse to 
confirm names of those detained or charged’.

Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the
 Commons culture committee, said: ‘My view is people should be named, 
particularly for sex offences, and one of the reasons is that it could 
encourage other potential victims to come forward.’

He added: ‘I don’t 
want to live in a country where the police go around arresting people 
secretly and quietly. The fact that they name people is an important 
safeguard.’

Arrests: Two more people have been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, which was set up in response to the crimes of Jimmy Savile, pictured

The BBC star who was arrested was one 
of two people detained on Tuesday morning after police swooped on two 
separate addresses in South London.

The pair are the 15th and 16th people 
to have been arrested under Operation Yewtree, which was set up to 
investigate claims of sex abuse carried out by DJ Savile and others. The
 identity of the other suspect, who is 74, has also been kept secret.

According to reports, a witness said 
that police arrested the 64-year-old star at 5am on Tuesday, and were 
seen removing material from his home. The witness added that the 
celebrity was easily recognisable, saying: ‘There’s no doubt who it 
was.’

When the star’s name was put to the 
Met on Wednesday, it refused to confirm his identity. A Scotland Yard 
spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to give a running commentary on the
 investigation. We don’t discuss names. We never have done.’

But the Yard indicated in a statement 
that the man is not suspected of committing offences with paedophile 
Savile, saying he came under the strand of the investigation dubbed 
‘others’.

The BBC said it was unable to comment 
on the arrest. But it later confirmed that there were no plans, at 
present, to take the star off air. A radio programme featuring him is 
scheduled to be broadcast in the next week.

Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1
 DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high 
profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following
 Operation Yewtree. They all deny wrongdoing.

Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged.

Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr 
remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him. 
Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his
 arrest.
