Norwich defender Sebastien Bassong has finally secured a loan move to Watford. 

The 28-year-old's switch to Vicarage Road was held up after the managerial turmoil to engulf the Hornets as Billy McKinlay left the club earlier this week. 

But they have come to an agreement and he is in line to debut next week after the international break.

Sebastien Bassong has made 141 Premier League appearances, but has fallen out of favour at Norwich

Bassong was captain under Chris Hughton but has fallen out of favour with manager Neil Adams.

Adams did praise Bassong after he played a development match against Southampton last Monday, but wanted shot of the former Newcastle centre-back.

The Cameroon international has made 141 Premier League appearances but dropped down to the Championship for the first time this season.

He has amassed 15 caps for his country, while Watford have beaten Championship rivals Blackpool to his temporary signature.
