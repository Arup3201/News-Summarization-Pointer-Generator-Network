Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, claimed that she was wrongly passed over for a top RAF job in favour of a male colleague with less experience than her

The Royal Air Force's most senior nurse who lost out on a top job to a man has won a sexual discrimination case against the Ministry of Defence.

Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, took the RAF to tribunal after she was passed over for promotion in favour of a male doctor who had three-and-a-half years' fewer service than her.

Today, in what is being hailed a landmark ruling, Group Capt Williams' claim that the MoD had discriminated against her when recruiting for a senior role because of her gender was upheld.

The tribunal, which found that just six of the 470 top jobs in the RAF were held by women last year, agreed with Group Capt Williams' claim and awarded her damages.

She brought the case in July 2011 after being passed over for the position as RAF candidate for the tri-service role of commodore of the Defence Medical Group.

As a registered nurse and midwife who had served in the RAF since 1984, and who had been a group captain since 2003, Group Capt Williams expected to win the role.

But despite her experience, and her being recommended for promotion to a senior non-nursing role based on her experience, the post went to Group Capt John Gaffney.

The 1* level role went to Group Capt Gaffney despite him having three-and-a-half years fewer service as a Group Captain.

Group Captain Williams claimed the MoD had breached the 2010 Equalities Act by discriminating against her because of her gender when recruiting for a role for which she recommended and well-qualified.

The tribunal was told that it was the
 RAF’s procedure to fill medical 1* roles that were theoretically open 
to doctors and nurses only with doctors.

The Royal Air Force only had six women in its 470 top jobs last year, the tribunal heard

In its ruling, the tribunal panel, 
led by employment judge Veronica Dean, criticised the RAF for this 
practice and also the low number of women in top ranks overall - 
amounting to between 1% and 1.3% of the total.

Group Capt Williams said she was pleased with the decision, saying: 'Following this decision, I hope that nurses in the Royal Air Force and the wider Armed Forces will have the opportunity to aspire to, and attain, more senior posts.

'I hope that nurses will also gain due recognition for their leadership, commitment and professionalism.

'This judgment represents an opportunity for the Armed Forces to scrutinise internal processes and practices and shatter glass ceilings.

The tribunal panel criticised Air Vice Marshal Mike Lloyd, now retired, for his ignorance of legislation

'It should be used as a platform to ensure that appointments are made with regard to merit and competencies, and not with regard to a person’s gender or their membership of a professional body.'

The panel also included scathing criticism of several senior officers, including Air Vice-Marshal Chris Morris who gave the promotion board a 'partisan and not unbiased' assessment of Group Capt Gaffney, who was under his command at the time.

Air Vice Marshal Mike Lloyd, who is now retired but was in charge of RAF personnel at the time, was also criticised for his lack of knowledge of discrimination legislation, an ignorance that left the tribunal panel 'incredulous'.

'Viewed with an objective eye against the job specification, we have considered all the evidence and find that for a number of reasons the claimant was not only equal to Group Captain Gaffney but that an objective review of her appraisals and those of Group Captain Gaffney would have led to the claimant being considered as the properly preferred candidate of the RAF,' it wrote in its ruling.

'While the respondents acknowledge that both the claimant and Group Captain Gaffney were competent candidates for the selection... the respondents assert that Group Captain Gaffney was the most likely to succeed in competition with the other candidates put forward by the other services and therefore he was selected on that basis.

'We consider such a rationale to be entirely subjective and unsustainable in the evidence before us and we conclude that the claimant was not selected because of her sex.'

Group Capt Williams was supported by the Royal College of Nursing in her claim.

Janet Davies, its executive director of nursing and service delivery, said: 'This is a landmark case, and bodes well for the future of nursing careers within the Armed Forces.

'It isn’t right for female staff to be placed at a disadvantage when they get to a senior level.

'The tribunal was clear - not only was Wendy Williams suitable to be put forward for this role, but an objective review would have led to her being considered as the preferred candidate.

'We hope that the Ministry of Defence will take on board the recommendations which come out of this tribunal so that the talents of female officers and nurses in particular are valued and harnessed in the future.'
