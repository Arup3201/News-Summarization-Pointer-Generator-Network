A bereaved wife once voted Mum Of The Year has been convicted of fraud after claiming widow’s allowance long after her new partner had moved in.

Benefits cheat Kelly Harvey, 30, won the award in February 2008 just five months before her husband Leyton, 25, lost his battle with cancer.

The mother-of-two, from Stapenhill, Staffordshire, began claiming the allowance soon after her husband’s death to help look after daughters Leigh and Mollie.

Kelly Harvey, from Stapenhill, Staffs, has been convicted of fraud after claiming widow's allowance since her new partner, Ryan Archbold (pictured with Harvey), moved into the family house in 2010

But Harvey carried on claiming the money - given only to single parents who have suffered bereavement - after new boyfriend Ryan Archbold moved into the family home in late 2010.

Harvey dishonestly received £8,302 in widowed parent’s allowance and council and housing tax benefits between 2010 and last year, Burton Magistrates’ Court heard.

Debbie Leadbeater, prosecuting for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: 'She began claiming the bereavement benefit in July 2008 following the death of her husband. She claimed this for her children and herself.

Leyton Harvey (above), 25, died of cancer in 2008. His wife had won Mum of the Year after caring for the couple's two daughters while also visiting him at hospital in Nottingham

'But she had a partner who was employed and living with her from 2010.

'His vehicle, credit cards and bank accounts were registered to her address.

'The widowed parent’s allowance should not have been paid after November 2010.'

Harvey was named Mum Of The Year by local newspaper the Burton Mail in 2008 at a New Year’s Honours ceremony held at Branston Golf and Country Club.

She was pictured in the paper receiving her award from then editor Paul Hazeldine.

Mrs Harvey was praised for her dedication in caring for the couple’s two daughters while fitting in daily visits to her husband’s bedside at hospital in Nottingham.

The death of her husband later that year made the paper’s front page as tributes poured in to her husband, an employee at engineering firm Roger Bullivant.

Leyton Harvey had previously defied a bleak prognosis in his fight against testicular cancer which spread to his spine, chest and lungs.

Following the death of her husband, Harvey posted a tribute to 'my life, my soul life and best friend' on memorial site GoneTooSoon.org.

She wrote: 'Leyton, my life, my soul mate and best friend, what do i do now? Things were once so great so happy, everyday life was fun just you me and our two little girls, now everything is so empty without you.

'Things where perfect until you was diagnosed with cancer, but even you didn't let that get to you, some days you didn't even look ill, you always looked great to me.

'The best news for all of us came 8 months later when you got the all clear and you could eventually come home to us for good, it had been so long since you’d been home it was going to be great, a family once again all under one roof.

'You came home at the end of May and how great was that? Our perfect little family back together once again, but then you started being sick and feeling week, but the doctors didn't seem too worried, just a bug they said, but you didn't get better and within just 3 weeks of you coming home you was back in hospital, but this time you didn't come home, you died within 4 days, organ failure.

'Now we're lost and trying to find ourselves again but it ain't easy, everything we do, songs we hear all remind us of you and the love we all shared, one day I’ll be with you but for now you have my heart, love you always babe xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx kelly, leigh & mollie.'

Neil O’Driscoll, defending, said Harvey began claiming the benefits legitimately after Leyton’s death.

He said: 'The dishonesty didn’t occur from inception. It began some two years after she first claimed the money when she found a new boyfriend.

'He used to stay at the property a few days each and every week. He eventually moved in and she should have disclosed that she was no longer eligible for the money.

'This was not dishonest from the outset. It became dishonest two years later.'

According to Harvey’s profile on social networking site Facebook, Harvey attended Burton and South Derbyshire College and now works at River View Primary and Nursery School in Suffolk Road, Stapenhill.

Magistrates bailed Harvey until May 31, when she is due to return for sentencing after a probation report has been prepared.
