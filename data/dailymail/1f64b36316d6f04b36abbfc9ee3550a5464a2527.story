A heartbreaking image shows an eight-year-old boy hugging a purple teddy bear for comfort as he arrives at hospital after losing his parents and baby sister in a horrific car crash.

The boy, suffering from head and abdominal injuries, and his other sister - whose third birthday was on the day of Sunday's crash - were orphaned when the family car slammed into a tree near Lake Mundi by Victoria's western border.

The 39-year-old father, who was driving at the time, died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after being trapped in the car for a number of hours.

The two remaining children were airlifted to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and survived with injuries.

Three people, including a woman and her baby girl, are dead after their car slammed into a tree in Victoria 

The father and driver of the car, 39, was trapped in the car for a number of hours but later died in hospital

The 29-year-old mother and her baby girl died at the scene of the crash, which happened about 7.30am on Casterton-Penola Road, near Lake Mundi.

The boy arrived in hospital with critical injuries but it has since been revealed he is now in a stable condition, Nine News reported.

He is suffering from head and abdominal injuries according to Fairfax Media. 

His surviving sister escaped the accident with only minor injuries on what was believed to be her birthday.

The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia.

Two children, a boy, 8, and a girl, 3,  have been left orphaned by the tragic accident

They arrived in Mount Gambier just 18 months ago, and had returned from a reunion with family in the Congo just hours before the accident, according to The Advertiser.

The family reportedly flew to Melbourne early on Sunday morning, immediately attempting the six hour drive home just after they stepped off the plane.

The Conglonese community in Mount Gambier held a vigil in memory of the young family on Sunday night, and a woman who works at the son's school spoke on behalf of the family.

'They are absolutely destroyed ... they are just grieving because it was such a sudden accident,' Inna Tucker told The Advertiser.

The accident takes Victoria's road toll to 39, compared to 36 at the same time last year

'They’d already been through so much as refugees, endured so much trauma ... they came here for a better and brighter future and it has ended up like this,' she said.

Superintendent Don Downs told the ABC it was a 'tragic collision' and part of a 'horror start' to the year in the area.

'People think they can drive in these back roads and there's not a big risk, but there is a big risk,' he said.

'When you come out to jobs like this it's heart-wrenching. Heart-wrenching on the community and heart-wrenching on the members who attended.' 

Victoria police say they think the driver may have missed a turn off, and fatigue may have been a factor in the crash.
