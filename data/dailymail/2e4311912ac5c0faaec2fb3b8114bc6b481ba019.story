An Amish boy in central Pennsylvania was seriously hurt after he was hit by a car and thrown 30 feet when he ran a stop sign on his pony. 

The boy's steed was killed shortly after impact on State Route 208 in rural Clarion County - about 90 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. 

Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Tate Allison told Daily Mail Online the boy 'failed to yield the right-of-way' while crossing the highway from a side road on Friday afternoon.
