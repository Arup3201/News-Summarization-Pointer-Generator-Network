The number of properties that went under the hammer in Sydney at the weekend have more than doubled from the same week last year.

Nearly 83 percent of properties up for auction in Sydney sold on Saturday, marking a big result for the first weekend of spring.

Of the 711 houses, there were more than 20 properties up for sale with a $2 million plus price tag over the last two weekends, which also doubled from the same period in 2013, according to RP Data.

A four-bedroom home at Burwood in Sydney's inner west was the top seller on Saturday when it went under the hammer for $4.5 million.

Sydney's property results follow a record selling August where 1,900 of the 2,660 properties listed for sale were sold.

A senior economist for Australian Property Monitors, Andrew Wilson, said buyers weren't deterred from the auctions despite the stormy weather.

This property was one of more than 20 up for sale with a $2 million plus price tag over the last two weekends

The four-bedroom has high ornate ceilings, an extra-wide hallway and polished marble flooring throughout

The layout of the house has separate formal lounge and dining rooms that could be used as extra bedrooms if required

The gourmet kitchen is overlooked by family living and dining spaces

'Thereâ€™s not much that could get in the way of a Sydney property buyer and an auction at the moment,' Mr Wilson told Fairfax Media.

Property sales in Melbourne also had a high clearance rate, with 75 percent of homes listed for sale actually selling.

Investors are estimated to have made up approximately 60 percent of sales in Sydney and 40 percent in Melbourne over the weekend.

In capital cities across the country 1,692 properties were listed for auction compared to 1,054 for the same period last year.

Other capitals to have increased clearance rates from this time last year were Brisbane with about 50 percent, Adelaide at 70 percent, Canberra with 56 percent and Perth at 27 percent.
