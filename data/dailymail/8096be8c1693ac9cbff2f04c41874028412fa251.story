Sir Alex Ferguson said in his autobiography that letting Dutch centre half Jaap Stam leave was his biggest mistake - but it must have been run close by the signing of Bebe.

The Portuguese forward's nightmare spell at Old Trafford is finally over as he joins Benfica in a deal worth up to £2.4million - four years after United's legendary boss spent £7.4million on him without even watching a video.

The deal represents a £5million loss on the initial investment - but Reds fans will just be happy to see their most ridiculed purchase through the exit door.

Oh Bebe please don't go: The Portuguese forward was a joke figure at Old Trafford

And if he finally reaches the potential that one of Ferguson's most trusted scouts had in him, United will be in line for a 50% sell-on fee of any future transfer deal for the 24-year-old.

United paid Vitoria de Guimaraes £7.4million for the striker in 2010, but he only started three games - all in the cup competitions.

He made seven appearances in total but never looked like making it into the United first team and he was shipped out on loan to Besiktas, Rio Ave and Pacos de Ferreira.

His spell with the latter last year brought 13 goals in 32 games, almost winning him a place in Portugal's World Cup squad, as well as sparking the interest of the Primeira Liga champions.

On Friday, Benfica confirmed they had bought the player, releasing a statement on their website which read: 'Bebe has signed an agreement with SL Benfica for four years.'
