Arrest: Christopher Sims, 30, allegedly met a girl, 11, on Facebook and encouraged her to meet

A father searching for his missing 11-year-old daughter found her with a 30-year-old man who had met her on Facebook and then raped her, police have said.

Christopher Sims, 30, from Lorain, Ohio, met the young girl on Facebook last year and urged her to meet him in person, Lorain Police Detective Tabitha Angello said.

She left her home, which is also in Lorain, and was reported missing by her father on February 19. She returned home on February 26 but when her father woke up the next day, she had vanished.

Two days later, he was driving through
 the neighborhood looking for his daughter when he saw her by Sims' 
apartment block, Angello said.

He
 went to the apartment but the young girl had already fled out of the 
back door, so he stayed in the area.

At 1am on March 1, he saw his 
daughter leave Sims' house with him, Angello said.

They
 climbed in his car and the father followed as he called police. 
Officers pulled over Sims' car 30 minutes later and found the young girl
 in the backseat, Angello said.

The little girl told police that she had been staying with Sims at his house and that she and Sims had sex on February 26, police said, the Chronicle Telegram reported.

On Tuesday, police executed search and 
arrest warrants at Sims' house in the 400 block of Iowa Avenue and they allegedly found items relating 
to the rape case.

He was arrested at noon on Tuesday following the search.

Scene: The concerned father had seen her run into this apartment - where Sims lives - earlier in the day

Angello did not provide information about the girl's condition, but that she had been issued with a summons for being unruly when she returned home.

'We advise parents to not to get 
involved' in cases, Angello told MailOnline. 'But if a father is looking for his 
missing daughter, I can't stop him.'

Records show Sims was previously indicted for rape, gross sexual imposition and unlawful conduct with a minor in 2010 for an incident in 2004.

He had pleaded guiltyto gross sexual imposition on February 19 and is awaiting sentencing.

Sims is being held at Lorain City Jail on a $1 million bond and will appear in court on March 13.
