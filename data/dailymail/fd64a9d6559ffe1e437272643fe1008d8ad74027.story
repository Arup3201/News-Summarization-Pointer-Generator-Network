Reward: £10,000 has been offered for help catching the killer of Nahid Almanea (pictured)

A £10,000 reward has been offered for help catching the person who stabbed a student 16 times on a footpath and left her for dead.

Police are still on high alert eight days after the frenzied attack on Saudi national Nahid Almanea, 31, near the University of Essex in Colchester where she studied.

Today the charity Crimestoppers announced a reward over her murder - and doubled its reward over another murder in the town which bears chilling similarities.

Essex Police do not yet know if the murder of James Attfield in March is linked to that of Nahid Almanea, but they are keeping an 'open mind'.

Mr Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 
times in what officers described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack in a park in another part of Colchester.

Each reward is now worth £10,000 for information leading to the conviction of either murderer.

Ann Scott, regional manager for Crimestoppers, said: 'The murder of Nahid has left Colchester residents feeling shocked, saddened and distressed.

'However, during this time of immense tragedy the whole community can unite in helping Essex Police find the person or persons responsible for this horrific murder.

'I would urge anyone with information no matter how insignificant they feel it might be or anyone with niggling suspicions they are unsure of to contact us anonymously safe in the knowledge that their identity will not be revealed.

'And please tell others that there is this safe alternative to pass on information about crime if they do not want to speak directly to police.'

The announcement came as officers revealed they have found 38 knives in a huge search near the scene.

Painstaking: Officers urged residents to check gardens for anything which could have been used as a weapon

The vast operation has included draining three fishing lakes and urging residents to comb through their gardens.

DCI Steve 
Worron said: 'Eight days on from the tragic murder of 
Nahid Almanea, a guest in our country and a devoted student at the 
University of Essex, we continue to make good progress with the 
investigation.

James Attfield was found dying in March after he was stabbed 102 times as he walked through Colchester's Lower Castle Park.

The killing was described as 'one of the most brutal murders' ever seen by police.

A post mortem on the father-of-five's body took eight-and-a-half hours to complete due to the shocking extent of the injuries.

He was stabbed in his arms, hands, back, neck and head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack.

Mr Attfield was described as ‘vulnerable’ by his family after he suffered brain damage following a car accident four years ago.

He was last seen in CCTV footage drinking at the bar of the River Lodge pub in his home town the evening before he was found dying.

He left the pub at 10.09pm and, strangely, left behind almost three quarters of a pint of his beer.

Police are still trying to establish what happened between leaving the River Lodge and when Mr Attfield was found injured in Castle Park, Colchester, at 5.45am the next day - March 29.

No-one has yet been charged in connection with his murder. The reward to catch his killer has been doubled from £5,000 to £10,000.

'So far we have had a fantastic response from the public, and I'm really grateful for the support they have given us. But I do believe that there are still members of the public who could come forward and help us as witnesses.'

Tutors said Ms Almanea was an exceptional English language programme student at the University of Essex who was aiming to study at PhD level.

On the day of her murder she was wearing a dark navy blue full length robe, called an Abaya, and a patterned multi-coloured hijab headscarf. She also had with her a black bag with orange panels which she was carrying on a shoulder strap.

Since her killing, 600 calls have been made to the incident room, 325 house-to-house inquiries made and 244 people spoken to during stop checks.

Richard Barnard, head of the 
International Academy at the University of Essex, said Ms 
Almanea had recently achieved the highest score in her class for a 
recent test - but 
was murdered before tutors could tell her the good news.

Mr
 Barnard paid tribute to her, saying she had a quiet determination to 
succeed.

'Nahid had
 shown herself to be an exceptional student on our English language 
programme since joining the University of Essex in January this year,' he said.

'She
 was very focused, always positive and had an inner self-belief. Her 
quiet determination to succeed, her hard work and her enthusiasm for her
 studies had really impressed her teachers

'Outside of the class, Nahid was always friendly, considerate and thoughtful with a very polite and courteous manner.

'She
 was making very good progress and her confidence was visibly growing. 
She clearly had so much to offer and was looking forward to going on to 
study life sciences at PhD level.'

Police are currently keen to speak to three people over the death - including a man who may have been following the student.

The man was spotted walking behind two women, one of them possibly Ms Almanea, at around 8.45am on June 13, four days before she was murdered.

He was seen to follow the pair as they came out of a house in Stanley Wooster Way, Colchester, and spoke with a local accent.

A second man police are interested in tracing was seen on the Salary Brook Trail - where she was murdered - shortly before Ms Almanea was found.

He was wearing a distinctive light brown Italian-style designer jacket. Detectives said he has not yet come forward and they need to speak to him urgently.

Officers are also keen to speak to a third man, who was caught on camera shortly after a woman was assaulted in an alleyway between Port Lane and Peache Road, Colchester, on June 19.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 01245 282103.
