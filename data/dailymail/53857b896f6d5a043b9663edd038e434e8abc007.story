Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev began his 150 hours punishment for  throwing punches at a property mogul during a TV show.  

The multi-millionaire was ordered to work repairing a playground at a nursery school in a remote Russian village named Maxim Gorky, close to a potato farm he  owns in Tula region. 

The 53 year old owner of the London Evening Standard and The Independent titles avoided jail and was sentenced to undertake public works, or community service.

Punishment: Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev has started his public works in Tula, Russia

Heavy lifting:The multi-millionaire was ordered to work repairing a playground at a nursery  school in a remote village named Maxim Gorky

Convenience: Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of  Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment close to his potato farm

This morning he was set to work in designer torn jeans and a warm jacket - both  bought in Los Angeles - carrying timber and digging the ground for a merry-go-round and preparing to install a slide alongside a team of regular  workers.  

The other workers mixed concrete and put a new seesaw in place, while a police  patrol kept a discreet distance but checked the media magnate was working.  

'I am fine, ready to start,' he said, picking up a spade.  

'It is a pity that such public works don't use the most of what a person can  do.  

Deal: The 53 year old owner of the London Evening Standard and The Independent avoided jail and was ordered to undertake community service

Routine: He spent his first day carrying timber and digging the ground for a  merry-go-round

'I would be glad to read some lectures, but no way, instead I must improve the  environment and do something very simple that does not require even minimum  qualifications.' 

Lebedev, who once spied for the KGB in London before starting a  banking-to-airline-to-potatoes business empire after the fall of the Red flag,  was convicted in July of throwing punches at billionaire Sergei Polonsky during  a TV talk show in 2011 during a heated debate. 

The images of the attack by the banker were flashed around the world and led to  President Vladimir Putin dubbing the act hooliganism.

Initially, Lebedev was changed with politically-motivated hooliganism, which  could lead to a seven year jail sentence, but this was withdrawn.  

Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of  Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment  close to his potato farm.  

He had already invested in the nursery school before serving his punishment  here.  

A local mother of five told him: 'We are very grateful for all your are doing  here. Another thing we really need here is good roads.' 

Lebedev is limited to working four hours a day, three days a week, so he will  take 12 weeks to complete his punishment, by which time there should be thick  snow on the ground. 

Ironically, Polonsky, the property magnate he struck, is now in detention in  Cambodia facing possible extradition to Russia on fraud charges.
