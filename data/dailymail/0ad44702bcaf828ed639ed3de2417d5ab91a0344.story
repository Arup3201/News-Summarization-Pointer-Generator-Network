James Bond's nemesis Goldfinger may be fictional, but his love of gold is a real phenomenon.

In fact, if the villain was alive and had £5m to spare, this might have been his next purchase - a Rolls Royce decked out inside and out with 120kg of gold.

This Rolls Royce Phantom - worth around £330,000 by itself - has been turned into a golden tribute for a mega-rich Middle Eastern business man by designer Liverpool-based Stuart Hughes.

With gold worth more than £3m lavished on the vehicle - plus other customised work to make the car both bullet and grenade-proof - the value of the car is now close to £5.2m.

Liverpool gold designer Stuart Hughes created the masterpiece of a vehicle

In total, 120kg
of solid 18-carat gold has been applied to the car both inside 
and out.

The outside trims have all been decked with gold, and for the inside, molds were made of all the fixtures, and then used to plate the interior.

The British designer has made a name for himself by apparently turning the most improbable of items into gold-decked luxury goods.

Previously, he is said to have 'blinged' iPads, Blackberries, and even a miniature version of a Bugatti Veyron, which, at a value of £2m, costs almost twice as much as the real thing.

The value of the Phantom may make it tempting to thieves - but think twice if you are tempted, as the Phantom is about as bullet-proof proof as they come.

Swiss company Eurocash AG, based in Zug, approached Mr Hughes for the project, and while he carried out the gold work, Eurocash set about making the car practically indestructible.

The vehicle can withstand more than 570 rounds fired into it from an AK47 assault rifle, as well as attacks from two hand grenades, meaning that unless the anonymous owner leaves the keys in the ignition, this car is likely to withstand any situations.

However, the Phantom is by no means the most expensive car ever sold - just last month a classic Ferrari changed hands for £20.2million.

The legendary Ferrari 250 GTO is the world’s most sought-after car, especially as there were only 39 models built between 1962 and 1964.

This 1963 model - number 5095 - is believed to have been sold by British businessman Jon Hunt, who bought it in 2008 for what was then world-record at £15.7million.
