A roller skating star who performed in front of millions at the London Olympics opening ceremony has been jailed after having sex with a 14-year-old fan in a car park.

Nathan Wright, described by a judge as a 'role model for young people', was first contacted by the schoolgirl through  YouTube after she had seen one of his skating clips.

The pair then began to message each other regularly, with the teenage victim 'flattered' by Wright's interest in her.

Edna Leonard, prosecuting, said it was clear from the start of their contact that the girl was only 14.

Derby Crown Court was told Wright, 26, of Tooting, London, went on to persuade the teenager to carry out a sex act on a webcam before he filmed himself performing a sex act and sent a recording to her.

Miss Leonard told the hearing they went on to meet at a rolling skating event, where Wright was approached by a number of fans wanting to be photographed with him.Â 

She said the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was among them and the pair slipped away to perform sex acts on each other.

The court heard they met again at an event at Rollerworld in Derby on October 21 last year. Wright had told the teenager to wear clothes that could easily be removed.

Wright persuaded the schoolgirl to slip away from a group of adults and they had sex in a car park.

Recorder Paul Mann QC, sentencing, told Wright, who also took part in the Paralympic Games opening ceremony: 'You are known as an accomplished roller-skater and have your profile on the internet.

'You have, through your skating, the opportunity to become a role model for young people.

'There must be young people who have followed you who feel let down by the offences you have committed.'

Wright, who admitted sexual grooming and two counts of sexual activity with a child, was jailed for five years.

He was also told he could not use the internet to contact anyone under 16 and was put on the sex offenders' register.

The court heard that he had previously been jailed for four-and-a-half years for a rape he committed when he was 18.

Jonathan Straw, defending, said the girl was a willing partner in their meetings and had sexual experience before meeting him.

He added: 'Before the text friendship developed, however inappropriately, there was genuine feeling on both sides. This is not a case where she was pressured.

'Unfortunately, the very rapid, almost explosive use of social networking among young people can give rise to this sort of difficulties.'
