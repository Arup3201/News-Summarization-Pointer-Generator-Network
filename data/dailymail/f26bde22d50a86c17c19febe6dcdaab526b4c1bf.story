Jutkiewicz spent the back end of last season on loan at Bolton Wanderers, where he scored seven goals for Dougie Freedman's side.

And his impressive end to last season has been enough for Burnley boss Sean Dyche to take a punt on the striker.

He started his professional career at Swindon Town, where he bagged himself a move to Everton.

But he made just one appearance at Goodison Park, where he was sent out loan to Plymouth, Huddersfield and Motherwell before making a name for himself following a permanent switch to Coventry in 2010.
