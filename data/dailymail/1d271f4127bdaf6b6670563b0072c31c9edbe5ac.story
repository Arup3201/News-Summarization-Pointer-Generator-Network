England continued their impressive start to Euro 2016 qualification with a 5-0 thumping win against San Marino on Thursday night.

Only 55,990 fans attended England's emphatic victory against their opponents though, making it the lowest-ever crowd for a Three Lions' match since the opening of the new Wembley in 2007.

England players have now started to embrace each other, arms around each other’ s shoulders, when singing the national anthem. It’s taking a bit of time to catch on, however. Captain Wayne Rooney led the way and players followed suit down the line. But for a while Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson were left, cut adrift at the end of the line – not quite the intended message of unity and togetherness – until they finally noticed and join in the team bonding.

Goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini wasn’t doing San Marino’s credibility at this level an awful lot of good when almost his first intervention was to give away a free kick inside his own penalty area for handling the ball twice – an error more akin to Sunday League. His desperate fling at Phil Jagielka, which ended with him head butting the Everton defender’s back-side as England opened the scoring, didn’t help matters. The accountant at last partially redeemed himself with a fine save from Danny Welbeck on 42 minutes.

‘Four Arsenal players in the England’s starting line-up,’ tweeted Gary LIneker. ‘Never thought I’d utter those words.’ (Strictly speaking he didn’t utter them: he wrote them). Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs and Calum Chambers were the men on Thursday night and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made a fifth when he came on at half time. Back in February, 1999, David Seaman, Martin Keown, Tony Adams and Lee Dixon started against world champions France at Wembley. It didn’t do any good mind you. England were played off the park and lost 2-0.

Scrap the commission, end all those Bundesliga love-ins: possibly the most significant results on Thursday night came in the Netherlands  where England’s Under 20 side beat Germany 1-0, thanks to a Nicolas Sule own goal. Ironically FA chairman Greg Dyke is expected to attempt to mirror some of the grass roots reforms in country’s such as Germany later on Friday when his commission unveils its second tranche of reforms that it wishes to see in the game. But maybe we have some good youngsters already.

The most-eagerly anticipated figure of the night was not the number of goals but the attendance – 55,990. That made it officially the worst-attended competitive England match since the new Wembley was opened, beating the previous lowest, of 57,897 against Andorra in June 2009 on the night of a tube strike. That said, after a dismal World Cup and in the least-interesting qualification process ever devised, it still represents something of a triumph that so many will still turn out for England.

There was a pregnant pause when the Wembley PA came to announce the man of the match. Joe Hart was leading the online vote with 53 per cent but the PA suddenly went quiet mid sentence, presumably suddenly realising the irony of the vote. A few minutes later he re-emerged to announce that Jack Wilshere was in fact man of the match, a scandalous suppression of the popular vote. Perhaps FIFA could investigate?
