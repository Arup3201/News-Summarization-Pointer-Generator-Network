A state university in Alabama has enforced a strict rule forbidding its new president from hosting romantic relationships in her campus home.

Alabama State University President Gwendolyn Boyd is a single woman, and as long as she is not married, she may not bring dates or even boyfriends back to her home--she even signed a contract on January 2.

The contract states that the university will pay her $300,000 per year, she will get a car, and the residence she is required to live in 'to preserve the campus spirit.'

Boyd, an alumni of Alabama state University and Yale graduate school, will begin working on February 1 and she says she doesn't mind the campus rule, reported the Birmingham News.

'For so long as Dr. Boyd is President and a single person, she shall not be allowed to co-habitate in the President’s residence with any person with whom she has a romantic relation,' the contract states.

'I do live alone, so it was not problematic for me,' Boyd told Inside Higher Ed.

However, there is dispute between lawyers over whether or not the State of Alabama or any state is allowed to infringe on liberties related to someone's residence.

'I don’t know of any state that has the right to invade someone’s residence even if the state owns that residence,' Washington D.C. lawyer Raymond D. Cotton told the publication.

'To convey that residence and dictate what kind of romantic relationship you can have in that facility – I mean, she’s not in prison.'

The university spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax responded to criticism by saying, 'The contract was negotiated between Dr. Gwendolyn Boyd and the Alabama State University Board of Trustees and both parties agreed to it and have no problem with it.'

Inside Higher Ed reports that while the restrictions in Boyd's contract are unusual, they are not 'unheard of.'

Inside Higher Ed spoke to Scott Miller, the president of Bethany College in West Virginia who said of the rules, 'Mostly they reflect the increasing scrutiny that campus CEO’s face as the chief image-makers -- indeed, the living ‘brand’ -- of the institutions that employ the, ' Miller said

Boyd is coming from John's Hopkins University where she spent at Johns Hopkins University. She worked as an engineer and an executive assistant it the applied science laboratory.

Inside Higher Ed reports that Alabama State University is not new to controversy and was audited by the governor's office for 'services that were not delivered' and 'payments to family and friends of board members.'

The University is suing the auditing firm.

The University started getting attention was a new president took office in fall 2012 and was paid $685,000 to resign after less than three months of working.

Boyd will replace William H. Harris, the interim president.

As for enforcing the rule, lawyer Scott Cotton joked, ' No board that I know of, certainly that I would advise, would have anything to do with a clause like this. How would you enforce it? Would you go marching into a president’s home and say, ‘Stop that, get your hands off him or her!’
