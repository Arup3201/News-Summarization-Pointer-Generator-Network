It's one of the fastest-growing sectors in fashion and the likes of Hermes and Estee Lauder have launched exclusive collections based on it.

Now clothing brand Aab is hoping to cash in on the trend for modest styles and Islamic fashion with its first boutique store featuring everything from Arabic cloaks (abayas) to hijabs.

More than 2,000 shoppers flocked to the shop, in East Shopping Centre, Green Street, East London last Saturday to see 'hijabi blogger' Dina Torkia, 25, open the store.

With clients queuing around the block, excited shoppers took selfies as they clamored to try on the designs.  

The company, founded in 2007 and based in London, creates original designs using in-house designers taking inspiration from global fashion trends and also offers bespoke and limited edition collections.

The brand is one of the world's leading online retailers in the modest clothing sector. 

More than 2,000 people turned up to the opening of the online retailer's London store, which will stock modest clothing - including abayas, hijabs and accessories

Aab said the opening of the London store - which stocks modest clothing pictured above - was the first phase of a long-term growth plan

Nazmin Alim, creative director of Aab, said: 'We are very excited and delighted to be able to launch our first physical store for our clients in London.

'The city is a key market for us. It's one of the most important international centres of fashion.

'This boutique store represents a physical manifestation of the Aab brand and heritage. It will enable us to present the premium quality of the brand authentically in an appropriate setting so our customers will be able to see, touch and feel our products in an environment we have carefully curated.' 

Experts predict the UK modest clothing market could be worth £100m a year and with customers from America, Canada, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East Aab says it is one of the world's leading online modest clothing brands.

Aab said the opening of the London store was the first phase of a long-term growth plan which includes boutiques in key 'international financial and fashion hubs' over the next three years including the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. 

On its website, Aab said of its style: 'Aab set out to create garments that take into account simplicity, style and comfort desired by Muslim women who find themselves playing multiple roles in today‘s society.

'Aab‘s concept is based on easy pieces, where a handful of interchangeable items work together to create an entire wardrobe that goes from day to evening, weekday to weekend, season to season.'
