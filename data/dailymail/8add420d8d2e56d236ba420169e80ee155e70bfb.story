A 45-year-old 'hockey mom' plied her son's teammates with alcohol before indulging in sex acts with two of them, a court has heard.

Kathia Marie Davis is alleged to have engaged the teenagers in sexual activity in her own house while her children were elsewhere in the property, it is alleged.

The divorced mother-of-three appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to charges relating to having unlawful sex with a minor under 16-year-old and committing a lewd act with a minor under the age of 14.

The two victims, who have not been named, are members of the same hockey association as Davis's 18-year-old son.

However, through her attorney, Davis - from Laguna Niguel in California - claimed she had to rebuff the advances of a 13-year-old that came on to her and that she believed the other boy, who she had consensual sex with, was the same age as her son.

Davis was placed under investigation after the 16-year-old told his mother what had happened and she contacted authorities, it has been reported.

According to KTLA, Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said: 'We received complaints that she was throwing parties for members of the hockey team and other friends of her son and providing them with alcohol.'

She is accused of having intercourse with the 16-year-old on four occasions in her bedroom between July 2010 and July 2011 and prosecutors say two of her children were in the house during some of those incidents.

It was during the course of the investigation with the 16-year-old that the younger boy came forward and made accusations against Davis, KTLA reported.

She allegedly fondled the 13-year-old during a sleepover at her house after giving him alcohol.

The full list of charges Davis is facing are as follows: Four felony counts of lewd acts on a child younger than 14; four of unlawful sexual intercourse with the second boy; three misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor; one allegation of substantial sexual conduct with a child.

If convicted, she faces a maximum of 17 years and eight months behind bars in a state prison.

She would also become a registered sex offender and would be subject to an order banning her from entering city parks and recreational areas.
