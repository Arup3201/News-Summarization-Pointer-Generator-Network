Onuoha is now once again fighting for top-flight survival, but the defender is confident that added experience will help them avoid relegation this time round.

He told the Daily Star: 'I'm ­surprised my hair is not grey yet. In some ways it's a good thing because everyone wants to play in pressure situations.

'Obviously this is a different pressure than when you are pushing for the Championship title but you want it ­going into a game. I am confident we can stay up.'
