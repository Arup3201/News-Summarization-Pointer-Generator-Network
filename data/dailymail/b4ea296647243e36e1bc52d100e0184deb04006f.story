When Brisbane man Ryan Heffernan split with his girlfriend their child was just one year old. 

It was then, the 41 year-old journalist's life came crashing down.

Hhis new role as a single father saw him strcuk down with depression and lose his  job at Channel 7 in Sydney.

'I was totally cocky and I thought I could do this - it was never in my head that I would do anything other than 50/50 and then I realised my talents were not near the standards of my ego,' Mr Heffernan told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I wasn't ready for it.'

When Brisbane man Ryan Heffernan, (left) split with his girlfriend their child was just one year's old

Ryan and his ex-girlfriend moved to Sydney about seven months before they split up, leaving him completely isolated and without help from his support system back home in Brisbane. 

The weeks Ryan was without his son, Louis, he noticed a destructive change in his lifestyle. 

'On the week I didn't have him I was drinking and partying far too much, blocking out that I didn't have the kid - that's how I managed it, which was really stupid because I ended up with depression.' 

It was when Ryan and his former partner sold their property that he decided to leave his high-intensity job, and threw himself into freelance writing and short-term contract work - which allowed him to live a flexible life, once   enough money was saved. 

Like many single dads, Ryan had difficulty fitting into mothers' groups, describing his area - Manly in Sydney's northern beaches - as affluent and influential, where mums do mum things and men go to work. 

'There are mother groups everywhere but dad groups are a few and far between,' he said. 

But it was the inspiration that came from being a single dad to Louis, now six years-old, that led him to write 'SuperDad SpeedBible', a 'high-performance toolbox for men with young kids.' 

Ryan has shared five tips he learned as a dad, in the hopes it will help other newly single dads cope with the transition.

THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND ME  

The first and fastest thing I learned as a dad was that I am, despite my long held belief, not the centre of the universe. The birth of my son coincided with the confronting realisation that I would now be the perpetual bridesmaid in our lives forever more. Strangely, this was actually quite liberating.

A LATE NIGHT FILLED WITH PIZZA AND WINE COULD NO LONGER OCCUR

The second realisation I made was that cheesy pizzas, wine and late nights to bed would ensure my parental downfall. Not like any other human being I had ever met, my child had boundless energy and a limitless need for high-grade entertainment. A fat, unfit bachelor was simply never going to cut it. So I got fit.

FAILURE IS ALWAYS AN OPTION 

As a single parent I also learned that failure is always an option. In fact failure is the norm. Stretched to the outer reaches of functional life I realised I would never be fully happy with my performance at work or as a parent. And so for the first time in my life I began trying NOT to bite off more than I could chew. 

GUILT IS A WASTE EMOTION 

Following on from point 3, I will forever be indebted to my son for teaching me that guilt is an utterly, absolutely, entirely and completely a wasted emotion. If you let it, guilt will infiltrate your work and your family. It’ll eat you up when the reality is guilt, by definition, is about what you did in the past, not what you are doing right now. And now is what counts.

BUDDHA KNOWS BEST 

Following on from point 4, I will be forever indebted to my son for taking the form of the pristine Buddha in our household. When you are a single parent with an only child they only have you to entertain and nurture them. That means you simply must learn how to get “in the moment” and give them your undivided attention. It took years, but my little Buddha taught me how.

Ryan said Louis, (right) was very excited when he realized the book was inspired by him. He said "Does that mean I’m going to be famous?"

 

Ryan said if he could be a stay at home dad and write full time it would be great

It was the inspiration that came from being a single dad to Louis, now six years-old, that led him to write 'SuperDad SpeedBible', a 'high-performance toolbox for men with young kids'
