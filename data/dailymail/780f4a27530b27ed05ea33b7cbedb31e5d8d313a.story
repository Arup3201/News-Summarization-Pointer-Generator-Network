They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and it appears Fatma Idem has taken the age-old maxim to heart.

The 34-year-old decided to get even with her spouse - by taking everything from their house when she left, including the roof and windows.

Fatma took crockery, cutlery, carpets and curtains when she left husband Sahin, 40, before returning to remove parts of the actual building.

Left without a roof over his head: Sahin Idem, 40, returned from work to find his wife Fatma had removed all their possessions from their marital home in Adana, Turkey, including the roof and the windows

Fatma waited until her husband was at work and then, aided by her brothers, she removed the roof and windows from the former marital home.

Neighbours in Adana, Turkey, called Sahin at work last week, to say his wife was dismantling their home.

Park warden Sahin raced home but was powerless to prevent the house being destroyed as Fatma proved she'd paid for the new roof and windows.

Sahin has now been forced to put his two young sons into temporary care until he can find and furnish a new home where they can be re-united.

Home sweet home: Fatma Idem, 34, also removed crockery, cutlery, carpets and curtains - but appeared to leave a large dark brown cabinet and two-seat sofa behind among the rubble
