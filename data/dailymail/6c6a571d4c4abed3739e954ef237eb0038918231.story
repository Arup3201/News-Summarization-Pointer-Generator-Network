Attending the opening of the Football Association's new £100m facility yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge made sure to dress to impress.

With the horror of those topless photos still no doubt looming large in her mind, Kate must have been keen to put on a brave face - and show as little flesh as possible. And so it was: That high-necked wool coat, buttoned up all day without so much as a hemline or collar of a dress beneath revealed.

Those black opaque tights and knee-high boots - it was a wonder she didn't wear gloves and a crucifix.

Smart: Kate wore the grey Angel coat in military grey by Reiss, which retailed at £325 last season when it was in store

In that neat wool coat, from high 
street store Reiss, Kate didn't put a fashionable foot wrong - and 
reminded observers that she does official engagement style so well.

Her homegrown Home Counties girl style, which has hardly changed since her St Andrews days (it's just a sight more polished now, and the shops she uses have changed) is traditional and demure. Good quality coat, boots, sensible heel.

The funnel neckline on Kate's coat (it can also be folded down to be worn for a more traditional single-breasted look) - meant she didn't need to worry about what she wore underneath - easy.

Her hair was blowdried into the bouncy waves she has made her signature look since she was propelled into the public eye. Accessories were kept simple: her sapphire engagement ring, and at her ears,  discreet drop earrings.

Kate's coat - the £325 Angel from a 
previous season, was styled with the £65 mock croc Betony belt, also 
from Reiss - giving the duchess a smart, cinched-in silhouette - and 
putting paid to the pregnancy rumours that constantly crop up.

Nipped in: Kate wore the coat with the £65 Betony belt by Reiss (from the 2009 collection), giving her a neat silhouette

Natural beauty: Kate, who famously does her own make-up, kept things simple with a nude lipgloss, gently shaded eyebrows and a dark brown eyeshadow and liner. Her earrings were simple amethyst and diamond drops by Kiki McDonough. On her hand was her stunning sapphire engagement ring

Kate wore a pair of earrings thought to have been personally customised for her by jeweller Kiki McDonough. The Duchess fist wore a similar pair in citrine and diamond (£1,990) last Christmas - thought to have been a gift from William - and later had a pair commissioned using amethyst instead. A similar pair with more diamond detailing at the clip is on Kiki's website (www.kiki,co.uk) for £2,200

AND IT'S LAST APPEARANCE... AT SANDRINGHAM IN 2011 FOR A PRE-CHURCH WALK ON THE ESTATE

Deja vu: Christmas day, Sandringham 2011: Kate had recently purchased the Angel coat from Reiss, which comes from the store's 2010 autumn/winter collection

 

Versatile: The Angel coat can be worn with the funnel neck up, as Kate chose to do today, or down for a traditional single-breasted appearance - but wearing it up means Kate didn't have to worry about what went underneath

Classic: Kate cinched in her coat with the Betony belt, £65, Reiss, bought from the 2009 collection
