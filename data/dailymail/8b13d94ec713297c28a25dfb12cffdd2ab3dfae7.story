The owners of a bar that was discovered more than a mile away from home after Hurricane Sandy moved it from a Brooklyn marina to a nearby neighborhood went through a rollercoaster of emotions over the past few days.

At first, they were confused as to how their floating bar managed to detach itself from their moorings and beyond that, they had no idea where it ended up.

Debbie and Louis Kallif were met with a glimmer of hope days after the storm, when they finally received an email from a friend who saw pictures of their bar on MailOnline, intact and in its new location in Gerritsen Beach.

Incredible: A floating bar from the Gateway Marina in Brooklyn ended up being swept away by Hurricane Sandy and moved more than a mile to this spot in the Gerritsen Beach neighborhood

Astonishing: Because locals had no idea where the bar came from, they just called it Sandy's Bar in honor of the hurricane, and speculated that it was a different bar from Breezy Point

As they scrolled through the story, however, their hearts sank again as they learned that city officials ordered the largely-undamaged bar to be smashed to pieces to make room for the ongoing clean-up effort.

Initially, local residents believed that the bar that mysteriously ended up in the middle of Madoc Street was a part of the Sugar Bowl, a famed watering hole from Breezy Point, Brooklyn.

Though the journey would have been incredible- as the bar would have floated seven miles- the patrons believed it was a tiny gift amid a day full of destruction.

In keeping with that belief, a group of men looking for a moment of distraction took over the bar and turned it into their own, dubbing it Sandy's Bar in the hurricane's honor.

Former home: The bar normally floats off a dock in the Gateway Marina in Brooklyn

Rising sea level: Owner Louis Kallif believes that because their marina was only met by a sea surge- rather than a high wave- the bar was able to stay intact and just float on top of the water

'We were so excited to see that the bar made it, and We were happy people that had nothing they were able to have some moments of comfort and joy in the devastation,' Debbie Kallif told MailOnline a week after the hurricane hit.

Her husband and co-owner agreed, saying that they were not upset to see the strangers taking over their bar but just happy to see it was being used as they intended.

'I thought "Oh look, there's people partying on board, that’s great!"' he said.

'I don’t mind people partying on it- we’ve had plenty of parties there through the years.'

Intact: The building's interior remained in remarkably good condition despite the extraordinary journey

Venue: Gerritsen Beach resident Lawrence Lowey enjoys a beer in the abandoned bar which turned up in the middle of his street

Normal service: Louis Kallif said that the bar was only open at the marina from April to October, so they had emptied it of all food and booze before it was swept away by Sandy

What they did mind, however, was the 
fact that as they read on, they learned that the police had brought a 
crane to break the floating bar apart in order to streamline the 
recovery process for the damaged properties nearby.

Though
she said that the bar normally has the couple's liquor license tacked 
to the wall, which lists the owners names and contact information, 
Debbie confirmed that they were never contacted by police about the 
decision to break it to pieces.

'If it was someone's boat, they weren't going to just trash it,' she said.

The floating bar had lasted a number of years- and storms- before it met its match in the police bulldozer.

Party time: Residents of Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, hooked up a generator and brought their own drinks to the bar, using it as a way to escape the destruction around them

Having a drink: The bar owner said that the bar was not stocked because it was only opened seasonally and he cleared out all liquor when he closed it to the public in October

Louis Kallif said that the floating 
structure has been around the Gateway Marina for around 30 years, 
serving as an office and a bait and tackle shop at different points of 
time.

It's most drastic 
change came in the months following the September 11th attacks when the 
FDNY used it as the headquarters for their Marine 3 fire boat unit that 
serviced nearby Jamaica Bay.

The fire department returned the structure to the Kallifs, who run the Gateway Marina as part of a contract with the government who owns the national park land where the marina is located, about four years ago.

Renamed: The revellers called the bar 'Sandy's Bar' after the superstorm and marked 'BYOB' on the side of it to instruct guests to bring their own bottles when the drink ran out...

...but the fun couldn't last forever, and the police ordered for the bar to be demolished and cleared away

Condemned: The digger reduces the venue to a pile of debris under police direction

At that time, they decided to return 
the building to the water and use it as a seasonal bar for patrons who 
rent out some of the marina's 500 boat slips.

Mr
Kallif said that the residents of Gerritsen Beach were clearly looking 
for a place to party when they found the bar, because he said it was 
empty of any liquor when it left the Marina moorings.

‘There wasn’t any alcohol on that 
because it’s a seasonal bar that closes in October- everyone brought 
their own alcohol, so no one stole anything or anything like that,’ he 
said.

And party they did, 
as pictures show a number of men taking swigs directly from rum, gin, 
vodka and tequila bottles inside the bar.

¿Our damage was basically from storm surge the docks floated up and floated above the pilings that they rest on, so they floated back down slightly differently,' Mr Kallif said

By the numbers: The Kallifs said that of Gateway Marina's 500 slips, only a couple dozen were damaged

In spite of everything, the Kallifs 
consider themselves lucky even though their marina is still without 
power or phone service, and their Long Island home just got electricity 
back Thursday.

Because their marina was hit mostly 
by a storm swell rather than a large wave, only a couple dozen of 
their 500 slips were really damaged.

‘It’s not bad,’ Mr Kallif said. ‘Our damage was basically from storm surge the docks floated up and floated above the pilings that they rest on, so they floated back down slightly differently but they didn’t break. We were really, really lucky.’

On top of the damage that they are dealing with at the marina, they don’t know where to start in terms of picking up whatever pieces remain from their bar in Gerritsen Beach.

Fun over: Partygoer Michael Farrell stands in front of the debris after police ordered for the bar to be demolished

‘I haven’t called the police or anyone, first because I don’t have service down by the marina still but also because I have no idea who to call,’ Mrs Kallif said.

The shock of having been a part of a Wizard of Oz-like storyline amidst the destruction of the hurricane seems to still be sinking in, but for now their priorities lie elsewhere.

‘I have no idea what we’re going to do about the bar,’ Mr Kallif told MailOnline. ‘I liked it. Maybe one day I’ll build another one but I’m not even thinking about it right now.’
