Determined: Caballero wants to oust Joe Hart as Manchester City's No 1 goalkeeper

'I am very happy, and really looking forward to the start of pre-season and performing well to help the team,' Caballero told City's club website. 

'This is a new challenge and a new league for me. I have been doing well in the previous years and my goal is to go on and hopefully perform at the same level for City.

'I know I am coming to a big club with a very good goalkeeper. City already have a great goalkeeper in Joe Hart, but I will try and compete for the no.1 spot. I will do my best in the training sessions.'

Caballero, who worked with City boss
 Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga, will come in as No 2 to England goalkeeper
 Joe Hart following Costel Pantilimon’s move to Sunderland on a free 
transfer.

He becomes City’s third signing of the 
summer following the arrivals of midfielder Fernando from FC Porto and 
Arsenal right-back Bacary Sagna.

Time to strengthen: City boss Manuel Pellegrini is busy adding to his squad ahead of the new season

Caballero added: 'The most beautiful moments of my career were under Manuel Pellegrini in Malaga, where we achieved big things and we made Malaga’s name known around Europe.

'As for my new team-mates, I have a very good relationship with Martin Demichelis, but I’ve never met Pablo Zabaleta and Sergio Aguero. It’s something I’m looking forward to. For me it is very good to have people from Argentina in the squad because I think it will be very helpful.

'I spoke to Roque Santa Cruz and Demichelis, and they told me that Manchester is a very beautiful city and very welcoming, so that will be great for my family and I can’t wait to enjoy it.'

'I’ve always loved the Premier League, I watched it as a child and I always liked the style of play here. When I was 19 I came to play a friendly against England and I really liked how they played and how passionate the fans are. It’s a big step in my career and a dream realised to play in the Premier League.'
