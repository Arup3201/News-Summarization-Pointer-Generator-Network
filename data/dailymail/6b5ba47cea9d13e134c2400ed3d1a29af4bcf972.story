The home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been struck by a missile fired by an Israeli aircraft, Gaza's interior ministry said.

It is believed the former Hamas Gaza prime minister’s home was empty at the time of the attack and no casualties have been reported. 

Haniyeh's son Abdel Salam said  missiles had hit the house, which is believed to be situated on the outskirts of Gaza City, twice. In a statement, he said: 'The Israeli enemy struck our house twice.'

The attack came as Hamas revealed its media stations Al-Aqsa TV and Al-Aqsa Radio had also been targeted. The television station continued to broadcast, but the radio station went silent as the building became engulfed in flames.

The attack comes after a day of fighting in Gaza which saw ten people - including eight Palestinian children - killed when a playground was subjected to a huge explosion.

Children were playing on swings in the Shati refugee camp on the edge of Gaza City when the blast obliterated the site. 

An Israeli military spokesman had no information on the  reports of missile strikes tonight but substantial damage is believed to have been caused to Haniyeh’s home.

Israel launched its Gaza offensive on July 8, saying its aim was to halt rocket attacks by Hamas and its allies.

It later ordered a land invasion to find and destroy the warren of Hamas tunnels that criss-cross the border area.

Earlier today, Israel denied responsibility for the playground attack, claiming it was a misfire of a rocket launched by Hamas militants. 

As night fell over Gaza, army flares illuminated the sky and the sound of intense shelling could be heard.

The military warned thousands of Palestinians to flee their homes in areas around Gaza City - usually the prelude to major army strikes.

A number of rockets fired from Gaza were launched towards various regions in southern and central Israel, including the Tel Aviv area.

At least one of the rockets was intercepted by the Iron Dome system. No casualties or damage were reported.

The latest atrocity comes after at least four Israeli civilians were killed by mortar fire on a kibbutz close to the border with Gaza last night, according to local radio and TV.

Some 1,085 Gazans, most of them civilians, have died in the 22-day-old conflagration. Israel has lost 48 soldiers and another three civilians have been killed by Palestinian shelling.

United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today demanded for an end to the violence in Gaza 'in the name of humanity'.

Mr Ban has accused the leaders of Israel and Hamas of being irresponsible and 'morally wrong' for letting their people get killed.
