It was as all going so swimmingly in defence for Arsenal. Laurent Koscielny was fit after Achilles tendinitis, Per Mertesacker’s recent displays were markedly better, Nacho Monreal was looking like a player who could displace Kieran Gibbs at left back and Hector Bellerin was finding his feet since graduating from the club academy.

For 56 minutes it looked like Arsenal would earn a fourth consecutive Premier League clean sheet. Then they allowed Harry Kane too much space to drill home the equaliser, before Koscielny lost the striker in the lead up to the late winner.

Back to square one, it seems, in the space of 30 minutes. Two mistakes, two goals and back to the drawing board for Arsene Wenger.

The Frenchman is also likely to be worried about the way his side were dominated by Tottenham, but instead he tried to deflect attention from such deficiencies by criticising referee Martin Atkinson. 

His comments could well land him in trouble with the FA, but no amount of referee-bashing could hide the fact that his side were second best.

‘I wasn’t happy with the referee. I felt, like us, he was not at this best,’ said Wenger. ‘I believe we made too many technical mistakes compared to our usual level — we lost balls we aren’t used to losing.’
