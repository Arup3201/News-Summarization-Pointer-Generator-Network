America’s wealthiest business owners are self-made and the younger they are, the more generous to charity they tend to be.

According to two separate recent surveys, a clear majority of America’s most successful business owners are self-made, and younger ones tend to be more socially conscious. Across all age groups, a majority also say they started those businesses to have more control over their futures.

The younger high-net worth entrepreneurs are, the more quickly they pile up wealth, according to a separate survey – likely a cause for Millennials more freely donating to various charities and causes than their older counterparts.

Living the American Dream: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the wealthiest of all millennials, and he is the most charitable

A US Trust survey of 711 people with at least $3million in investible assets that found that 78 per cent founded or co-founded the businesses the made them wealthy also found that 70 per cent acquired the bulk of their wealth through that business.

The American Dream isn’t dead yet.

‘Business ownership is alive and well in the U.S. economy, and new innovation is fueling entrepreneurship that knows no age limits,’ Keith Banks, president of U.S. Trust, told Fox Business.

With 60 per cent telling US Trust they 
feel more able to create significant wealth by going into business 
themselves, it’s no surprise that 60 per cent say they did so  to have 
more control over their futures.

Additionally, US Trust found that 79 per cent of Generation Y (Millenial) entrepreneurs claimed their prosperity better enabled them to positively contribute to society. Little more than half of Generation X business owners answered similarly.

Given the sizeable generosity the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, this should come as little surprise to many.

A separate survey, conducted by Fidelity, found that both Generation X and Y millionaires give significantly more, and are more outwardly socially conscious than their baby boomer parents.

While Gen X and Y millionaires give $54,000 a year to charity, baby boomers donate a measly $12,000, according to Fidelity.

Also, 82 per cent of younger high-net-worth individuals volunteer or serve on the board of a charity, only 49 per cent of baby boomer millionaires can make that claim, Fidelity said.

‘Gen X/Y millionaires are taking a dramatically different approach to their wealth than the older generations, signaling a new era of wealthy investors," said Bob Oros, executive vice president of Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services.’

Topping the list of new money generosity is Mr Zuckerberg, who gave almost $500million to charity last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Facebook founder famously donated $100million to the Newark, NJ city school district in 2010.

Mr Zuckerberg, along with other tech entrepreneurs are also reportedly planning to launch an as-yet-unnamed education and immigration advocacy think-tank, according to multiple reports.
