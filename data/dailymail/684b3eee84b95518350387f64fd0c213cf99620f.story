The family of Jahi McMath continued to try to stabilize her body today as the full enormity of the task was outlined in court papers.

Chris Dolan, the family’s lawyer, said they continued to 'fight to save' the 13-year-old who was declared brain dead after an operation to remove her tonsils.

He and the family successfully campaigned to stop Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, from turning off a ventilator keeping her heart beating and had her transferred to another medical facility.

But the lack of brain function and three weeks without proper nutrition have taken their toll, and doctors were struggling to reverse the deterioration of her body, he said.

Papers filed by the hospital for a now cancelled court case today, also showed that the body was showing serious signs of decay and only the 'illusion of life'.

'We believe that as long as her heart is still pumping she is still alive,' her uncle, Omari Sealey, insisted to Piers Morgan.

'Right now we are just taking it one day at a time. We are happy where she is right now, that we were able to remove her safely from Children’s Hospital.

'She is moving a lot more. She responds to audio and touch and more compelling evidence is that she can move her head and neck.'

His voice cracked as he told how all the family wanted was to see Jahi smile again.

'Jahi is a very sweet girl,' he said.

'She
 is very shy and she smiled all the time and I can still see her smile 
and I am still praying that one day I will be able to see her smile once
 again.

'She is everybody’s favourite. She had that kind of personality that you just gravitated towards.

'It
 is very tough that we are unable to communicate with her. We can 
communicate with her in spirit but we would love to be able to hear her 
voice.'

His comments came as papers issued for a district court case to discuss the original injunction, due to expire today, revealed the mountain the family have to climb.

Dr Heidi Flori, a Children's Hospital Oakland paediatrician, wrote that there were clear indications that Jahi's body was deteriorating. 

She said that because of brain stem damage, Jahi could not regulate life sustaining functions such as heart rate, temperature and breathing.

The tissues under her skin were losing their elasticity, and her muscles were contracting, she said.

Her blood pressure spiked but was gradually declining and was now half what it was, she added, and blankets were needed to maintain a constant temperature.

'This deterioration became inevitable the moment she died,' Dr Flori said.

'Additional and more dramatic signs of the body's deterioration will continue to manifest over time, regardless of any procedures and regardless of any heroic measures that any facility might attempt.

'Mechanical support and other measures taken to maintain the illusion of life where none exists cannot maintain that illusion indefinitely.'

She concluded that further interventions would not bring her back to life, saying they could be counter productive resulting in her heart stopping.
