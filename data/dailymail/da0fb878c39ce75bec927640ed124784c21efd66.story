A Maryland couple in their 50s have been arrested and charged with sickening abuse of their 22-year-old autistic twin sons.

Montgomery County Police said that 57-year-old John Land and his 59-year-old wife Janice Land kept their two boys prisoner in a fetid, urine soaked basement that was 'not fit for animals'.

According to court documents the two parents would lock their sons - who are unable to speak - downstairs from 10pm to 5am each day and had been doing so for the past six years.

Police discovered the suburban house of horrors on Friday when they arrived at the house to serve a search warrant on an unrelated matter.

According to their report, officers came across a padlocked basement room with no light and when they broke inside found the two men who had one comforter covering the tile floor between them.

Officers said the room stank of urine and the floor and ceilings were crawling with cockroaches.

When officers asked the Land's how they would know if their sons needed anything, they allegedly replied that their screams and yells would eventually wake them.

The couple were booked into the local county jail on Friday and were later released on bond and have denied all the charges - claiming their boys were locked away to stop them from leaving the house.

John Land told police that one of his sons had been violent in the past, causing him to keep him in the basement room, locked from the outside.

The Lands were each charged with two counts of abuse of a vulnerable adult and two counts of false imprisonment.

A police spokeswoman declined to say what had originally led detectives to the house.

Officers called paramedics to the home and the twins were both taken away for evaluation.

Natalie Larson is a neighbor of the Lands who works with children with disabilities. She claimed she was sickened by the reports.

'I don't know how anyone would think that's an acceptable way to keep anybody,' she said to Fox 5.

Another neighbor, Sharon Drennan said that her son was friends with the Lands other children and knew about the alleged abuse.

She said that she had tried to contact the authorities as long as three-years ago.

'There were cops in that house several times and never removed the children. And it came to this? This long?' said Drennan to Fox 5.
