The team coach trundled into the Main Stand car park shortly after 6pm. There was no fuss, no fanfare, only a small welcoming committee.

As Brendan Rodgers made his way off the bus, followed by his coaching staff then his squad, there was no ringing adulation or none of those famous songs to get them in the mood for the crucial assignment that was looming.

How stark the difference. Last season, as Liverpool were trying to win the title, you couldn’t move on Anfield Road when the team arrived at the stadium: flags decorated the streets, flares would be set off, songs were sung. The fans did all they possibly could to lift Rodgers and his men over the line.

'You'll Never Walk Alone' was sung but it lacked the oomph normally associated with the Liverpool anthem

It was supposed to be the same last night, wasn’t it? Magical things are meant to happen at Anfield when the floodlights are on. A raft of Europe’s greatest names have buckled under the frenzy that has tumbled down from the terraces. Basle, so the theory went, would be next.

So sure that the atmosphere would play a part in helping Liverpool produce the performance they needed, Brendan Rodgers even devoted 183 words of his programme notes to talk about the mystique of such occasions.

‘Your role is critical,’ Rodgers wrote. ‘I have had my own experiences of seeing the power of Anfield under the lights. I would ask that you play the same crucial role as you always do. Hopefully we can produce a result and a performance to make you proud.’

Now there is no doubting Anfield has witnessed some improbable victories, with St Etienne (1977), Roma (2002) and Chelsea (2005) being prime examples of evenings when the stadium shook to its old foundations.

For the warm-up, there was muted apprehension from the stands, rather than support for their team

Raheem Sterling's performance lacked any kind of conviction, much like the majority of the team

But one thing tends to get overlooked when atmosphere comes on to the agenda: players and teams create it. Fans get up for these encounters when they have faith that the men they are going to support will produce for them. It is a two-way street.

At this moment, Liverpool’s fan s are struggling for belief and that was apparent from an early stage. During the warm up, many on The Kop stood in muted apprehension as the squad went through their paces. In the far corner of the stadium, by contrast, Basle’s followers were finding their voice.

Even the singing of You’ll Never Walk Alone lacked oomph and the anxiety levels had increased just 42 seconds into the encounter, as Simon Mignolet and Dejan Lovren exchanged unnecessary passes, leading Martin Skrtel to slice the ball out of play.

You can tell early on in this arena how things are going to unfold and, suddenly, every errant pass was greeted with groans, each decision that went against Liverpool sparking a protests. If a man in Red dithered in possession, they were barracked to quickly find an option.

Such was the frustration at the lethargy in Liverpool’s play, there was a chant of ‘Attack! Attack! Attack!’ to try and galvanise some response but, frankly, it was half-hearted and lacked any kind of conviction. Words, quite frankly, that sum up the team.

Belatedly, the mood changed but that, more than anything, was down to the local hero. Steven Gerrard’s thundering challenge in the 62nd minute sparked some defiance then his superb free-kick cranked the decibels up to a level they have not been at since Manchester City came here in April.

In stark contrast to last season, the Liverpool fans were disappointing on their big Champions League night

The Basle fans found their voice in the warm-up, and continued to support their team throughout the match

‘This crowd push and they create for the team and they make it difficult,’ Paolo Sousa, Basle’s manager, noted. ‘The last 10 minutes were hard. Liverpool have quality and when they had their first shot on target and they scored.’

Much to their frustration, however, the second goal that would have carried them into the last 16 proved elusive, despite the frenzied exhortations. It was too little, too late. And that, to Rodgers and company, will be a source of immense regret.

‘We want to be playing in Europe,’ said Rodgers. ‘The history for the club is strong. Alongside that we want to finish in the top four and that is something we will try and do.’

At this point in a bitterly disappointing campaign, such goals seem a long way off. Anfield has lost its spark.
