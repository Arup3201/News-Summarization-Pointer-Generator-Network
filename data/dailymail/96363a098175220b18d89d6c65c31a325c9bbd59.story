Myleene Klass has boasted about a huge increase in sales of her lingerie collection

Myleene Klass has boasted about  a huge increase in sales of her lingerie collection following a row over a birthday gift donation at her daughter’s private school.

The radio presenter revealed that sales of her new Littlewoods underwear range were up 200 per cent after she tweeted extracts of a group email she received from parents at the school.

The email, which she branded ‘bonkers’, asked for donations of a ‘suggested £10’ to buy their children presents, including a Kindle, and leave the cash in the child’s school bag.

Miss Klass, whose seven-year-old daughter Ava goes to the £5,000-a-term school, posted the extracts last week and was confronted by angry parents who accused the model of ‘betraying’ them.

But despite the row, the mother-of-two uploaded a picture of herself posing in a red lingerie set on Instagram on Wednesday and said: ‘O.M.G.!!!!! Girls!!! Sales of my lingerie are up by 200%!!! Please get in quick to ensure you get your order. Xx #littlewoodslovesmyleene @littlewoodsonline.’

Parents at the north London school suggested the 36-year-old may have posted the initial emails, which were later revealed to be a year old, in order to get some publicity.

A source told the Daily Mirror last week: ‘It is bang out of order. These are old class emails from a year ago. We have all noticed that the paparazzi are no longer outside the school taking her picture like they used to be every morning.

‘Perhaps she needed to get some attention. The press have certainly all been back here today.’

The headmistress stepped in following the furore and wrote a strongly-worded letter to all parents, which said: ‘If you can’t tweet anything nice, don’t tweet anything at all.’

The row erupted last week after Miss Klass posted a picture of the message which stated: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year.

‘Sarah would like a kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on Feb 9th.’

The request added: ‘Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’

The radio presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents' preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year'

Myleene posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response

Myleene, pictured, right, with her two young daughters, maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents, who are under pressure to do the best for their children, of what birthdays should be about

A second email from another parent who offered to collect the cash reiterated that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute, but added: ‘feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift’.

Miss Klass, who also has a three-year-old son named Hero, sent a mocking response in which she requested a unicorn for her daughter.

The email said: ‘Dear all, for Ava’s birthday, she has requested real, live unicorn.

‘I will be collecting unicorn money via her book bag, in the playground or at www.getwhatyouregivenandendthismadness.com.

‘(Additionally I’d like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too).’

She added: ‘If you don’t wish to, please don’t feel any pressure from the countless emails I intend to follow this up with and clog your inbox. Love and thanks!!’
