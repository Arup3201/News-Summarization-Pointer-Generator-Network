Errors in hospital waiting list times have undermined public confidence in the data, claims a public spending watchdog.

The Public Accounts Committee called for independent audits in future after spot checks found one in four hospitals recording false waiting list times.

It said hospital Trusts were 'struggling with a hotchpotch' of IT and paper-based systems that made it difficult to compare their performance.

One in four hospitals checked were found to be misrecording data on waiting times

Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said patients are being deprived of choice

For example, there were variations on how many cancellations patients were allowed to make of planned surgery before having to go back to their GP which affected when the waiting time 'clock' was re-started.

PAC chairman Margaret Hodge MP, said 'If patients cannot be confident of accurate comparable data on the performance of hospitals they cannot exercise choice.

'Both GPs and their patients need reliable and comparable information about the waiting time performance of individual trusts so that they can make an informed choice about where to be treated.' The committee's report published today says the National Audit Office found records of waiting times riddled with errors.

Spot checks carried out by the NAO showed in more than half of cases, hospital trusts were either wrongly recording data about waiting lists or keeping incomplete records.

Dr Mark Porter: 'It's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable'

The NAO found details were falsely recorded in 26 per cent of the cases examined - most often because NHS administrators were 'starting the clock' at the wrong times, or routinely pausing official waiting times.

NHS targets, introduced by Labour in 2008, state that 90 per cent of patients who need inpatient care and 95 per cent who require outpatient treatment should wait no longer than 18 weeks.

Mrs Hodge said 'Public confidence in the success hospital trusts have had in meeting the 18 week waiting time target is inevitably undermined by errors in trusts' recording of waiting time information.

'Waiting list data needs to be independently audited.'

She said the committee was 'sceptical' about the chances of the new e-Referrals appointment system - due to replace online Choose and Book - being any better used.

Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, said 'Waiting for an operation or treatment can be a worrying and stressful time for patients, so it's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable.

'It is also essential so that GPs can provide patients with the right information on waiting times, as this can affect where they decide to seek treatment.

'Ministers need to ensure data collection is consistent and reliable. However a rise in the number of private providers and the fragmentation of services, resulting from the government's top down reorganisation, has made this harder, not easier to achieve.'
