It was a fine advertisement for the Premier League - served up by two teams desperate to stay in it.

Saturday's match between Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City featured a remarkable 52 shots at goal, a record total since Opta began recording that particular statistic in 2006.

The punters at Loftus Road certainly got their money's worth in a thrilling, end-to-end encounter of porous defences and rampaging attackers.

Five of those 52 chances were converted, as QPR won 3-2 to lift themselves off the foot of the table at Leicester's expense.

The previous Premier League high was 50, during a match between Manchester United and Sunderland on April 14, 2006.

Incredibly, that match at Old Trafford ended goalless as United's slim hopes of catching Chelsea in the title race were ended.

There have been three top-flight matches since 2006 that have seen 49 shots on goal - Man United's 3-0 win over Tottenham in August 2011, Bolton's 2-2 draw with Blackpool in November 2010 and Everton's 3-0 win at Swansea City in September 2012.
