Sunseekers in Britain can swim in sea temperatures warmer than those off the coast of California, marine biologists have revealed.

Scientists say the water has reached a seven-year high of 20.4C at Start Bay, Devon - warmer than Santa Monica beach in Los Angeles, where the water temperature is 19.4C.

Researchers at Plymouth Marine Laboratories say strong sunlight and light winds are responsible for the balmy seas.

Dr Tim Smyth said: 'We were looking at an average year until June but over the last six weeks temperatures have risen quickly. It is not surprising because there has been a lot of sunlight and calm weather but, crucially, mild nights too, so less heat is lost.'

Britons have descended on beaches in their thousands as the nation enjoyed another day of sweltering summer heat.

Asda reported a 50 per cent boost in 
suncream sales as seaside resorts from Brighton to Sunderland became a 
sea of windbreakers, with families spreading themselves on the sand as temperatures once again nudged 30C.

Even the animal kingdom cooled off - with keepers
 at the New Forest Wildlife Park in Hampshire, which saw some of the 
hottest temperatures in Britain today, giving otters an ice lolly 
containing a dead fish.

But forecasters have warned there 
could be sporadic thundery showers as the country prepares to cool off 
tomorrow, which Sunday maximum temperatures dropping below 20C in the 
north of England and Scotland.

It will be a welcome change for Manchester's firefighters, who last night had to douse 
the city's Grade II* listed Barton swing bridge in water after the structure got stuck in the heat.

Dozens of residents waited patiently to cross the metal structure across the Manchester Ship 
Canal after it was unable to close.

And yesterday a 61-year-old man became the fifth person to die in Britain's lakes and rivers this week. Police
 suspect the unnamed man had a 'medical episode' while trying to fetch a
 ball from the Blue Lagoon lake near Bletchley, Buckinghamshire.

A
 member of the public pulled him from the water at around 6.40pm 
yesterday, but paramedics were unable to save him and he was declared 
dead at the scene.

Cooling off: Keepers at the New Forest Wildlife Park offered ice lollies containing fishy treats to the park's otter population as the mercury remained high

His death
 has led to renewed warnings about the hazards of venturing into open 
water as the school summer holidays start amid high temperatures.

For
 most, however, a blazing hot Saturday on the first weekend of England 
and Wales' school holidays offered the perfect chance to bask in 
glorious weather before it cools off tomorrow.

Temperatures we expected to push just higher than Malaga on Spain's Costa Del Sol, which was due to record around 28C according to the BBC.

Thousands
 of people were expected to attend the second day of the Sunderland 
International Air Show, despite all flights being grounded last night because of low cloud.

Met
 Office forecaster Helen Waite said: 'It's going to feel a lot cooler 
tomorrow than it has been - we're looking at high teens in north west 
England where there'll be more cloud, though it could still be 25C in 
London. There's the potential for thundery downpours in the north'.

Glorious! There were blues skies, glorious sunshine and deck chairs aplenty at Seaburn lighthouse this morning ahead of the Sunderland International Airshow today

She said the top expected temperature near the Solent this afternoon was expected to be 29C 'or even possibly another 30C'.

She
 added: 'Generally it will be sunny for southern and eastern areas 
today.

'The majority of the country should see some dry, fine conditions 
for most of the day but in the north west, Northern Ireland and western 
Scotland we have a band of rain which is moving eastwards as we go 
through the evening and overnight.

'There
 is a risk in the late afternoon of some isolated showers popping up. 
The majority of places should stay dry but there will be a few sharp 
showers.

'As we go overnight
 this band will move eastwards across northern England and Scotland and 
perhaps moving as far down as the East Midlands and East Anglia, 
dissipating on Sunday morning.

'Another band of rain will hit the western coast of Scotland and move into northern England overnight.
