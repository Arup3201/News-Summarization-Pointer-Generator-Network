David Moyes has now marked 50 games in charge of Manchester United.

Sunday's trip to former club Everton will be his 51st at the helm. It is, however, unlikely to be a milestone he will be celebrating. Rather, it may well come as a point of relief that he has survived this far.

For it is fair to say his steering job of the champions has proved a rocky ride. Along the way there have been calls for him to go, each of United's 10 defeats triggering forensic analysis of his failings.

All smiles: David Moyes will mark his 51st match in charge of Manchester United against his old club Everton

There are sure to be similar inquests between now and the season's end and, once the campaign does reach its conclusion, the question will be asked: Does David Moyes deserve more time?

The theory, of course, is that time equates to success. Many would argue that is a somewhat short-sighted stance, for a bad manager would merely worsen the plight of a club given too long to inflicts his ills.

But history, in fact, shows that the best managers - those we house in the bracket of 'greatness' - have been afforded time despite unspectacular starts.

Indeed, Sportsmail can reveal that, over the first 50 games of their respective tenures, the likes of Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Bill Shankly and Brian Clough did not fare as well as Moyes.

They did, of course, go on to enjoy silverware-laden stewardships having negotiated what were indifferent beginnings.

Ferguson and Wenger share an identical record of 22 victories, 18 draws and 10 defeats. Moyes' return of 27-9-14 is the equivalent of being six points better off (*see below for our method of calculation).

This, then, suggests Moyes should be granted the time to reverse fortunes at Old Trafford.

In the current era, no manager has enjoyed a more lucrative return from their first 50 games than Jose Mourinho during his initial spell at Chelsea. In 2004, the Portuguese, having arrived from Champions League winners Porto, guided the Blues to Premier League victory.

His first half century produced just four defeats and our table has him collecting 118 points from a possible 150.

Incidentally, our findings show current Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to be second best to Mourinho's effort a decade ago.

Indeed, his predecessor Roberto Mancini earned the equivalent of 20 points less than the current incumbent.

Of the managers who have survived testing times before subsequently flourishing, Don Revie is perhaps the best example.

He was promoted to the role of player-manager at Leeds United in 1961 with the Elland Road club in the second tier.

Of his first 50 matches, 24 were to end in defeat. The board kept faith and, by 1974 and before Revie's exit for England, they had won two league championships, two Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, one FA Cup and one League Cup.

Brendan Rodgers is another who endured criticism during the early days of his reign. Today, the Liverpool boss is on the brink of sealing his club's first title in 24 years, and he's still only 93 games in to his Anfield stay.

So does Moyes deserve a second season to turn things around? Look at our table below and the evidence suggests he probably does.
