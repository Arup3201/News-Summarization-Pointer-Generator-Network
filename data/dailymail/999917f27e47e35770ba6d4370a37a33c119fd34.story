European airports are bracing for another volcanic eruption that could cripple summer travel plans.

Scientists are closely monitoring unusual underground activity that could signal a massive explosion at a volcano dubbed the 'Gateway to Hell.'

The Heckla volcano in southern Iceland is capable of producing four times the debris of the country's last ash-producing blast that caused flights to be cancelled across northern Britain in May.

Danger: Scientists have recorded 'unusual' magma movement beneath the Hekla volcano in Iceland, prompting fears it could soon erupt

In April last year, ash from an eruption at Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano grounded flights across Europe for days, disrupting travel for 10 million people in the biggest airspace shut down since World War Two.

University of Iceland geophysicist Pall Einarson said yesterday that magma appeared to be moving deep beneath the giant volcano.

'The movements around Heckla have been unusual in the last two to three days. The mountain has been slowly expanding in the last few years because of magma buildup .The volcano is ready to erupt,' he added.

In the past few decades, Hekla has 
erupted about every 10 years, most recently in February 2000, and 
experts believe another one is overdue.

Hekla is so active that scientists 
estimate about 10% of the tephra - the solid matter ejected when a 
volcano erupts - produced in Iceland over the past millenium, about 
five cubic kilometres, comes from this one volcano.

It is feared that four times as much debris will be spewed into the air as when Eyjafjallajokull, pictured, erupted last year

'No eruption has started in Hekla volcano. But it might start without any warning.' said Icelandic volcano expert Jon Frimann.

Hekla,
which means hooded cloak in Iceland, has erupted more than 20 times – 
and once a decade in recent times in 1970, 1980, 1991 and 2000.

Its
first eruption, in 874, produced 2.5 cubic km of tephra, the scientific
term for various kinds of debris emitted by volcanoes.

The
Eyjafjallajokul eruption in April 2010 produced roughly 1.8 cubic km 
over three days. The main reason it grounded so many flights for over a 
week was that the ash cloud hung so low.

If Heckla blows, the amount of disruption it causes will depend on it size and the speed and direction of the wind.

Both of Iceland's latest eruptions provided warning signs several hours before, but Hekla is known for having a very short fuse.

'Hekla never gives you much of a 
warning,' said Mr Einarsson, In 2000, it began rumbling an hour and a 
half before the outbreak of magma, which was actually an unusually long 
warning. In 1970 we only got 25 minutes notice,' he added.

Rongvaldur Olafsson, a project manager at the Icelandic Civil Protection Authority, said no immediate safety precautions were being taken but: 'We will watch the mountain and developments very closely.'

After Iceland's last two eruptions, geologists have warned that the country's volcanoes appeared to have entered a more active phase and that more eruptions could be expected, with Hekla believed to be first in line.

The volacano, situated about 70 miles east of the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, is a neighbour of Eyjafjallajokull.
