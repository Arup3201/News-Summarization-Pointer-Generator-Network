A dangerous high-speed car chase across the western suburbs of Adelaide has ended after a stolen car hit an oncoming truck and crashed into a pub.

A 27-year-old man has been arrested and branded an 'idiot' by police after he endangered dozens of other vehicles while driving the stolen car on Wednesday morning.

The car chase followed an earlier incident when the man allegedly attempted to rob a West Lakes hotel while armed with a screwdriver.

A stolen black ute crashed into The Lady Daly Hotel in the Adelaide suburb of Hindmarsh on Wednesday morning following a dangerous car chase

A 27-year-old man from New South Wales has been arrested following the car chase, after he allegedly attempted armed robbery at a different hotel in West Lakes

Lakes Resort Hotel general manager Trent Fahey told The Advertiser he confronted the man but withdrew when the man allegedly threatened to stab him.

'Our gaming manager was first to see him and grabbed him and yelled "stop". He's pushed her over and then that's when I chased him,' Mr Fahey said.

'He legged it pretty fast and then turned around and confronted me and said "I'll stab ya".'

The man then fled the scene in a black Holden ute, which had been reported stolen earlier in the day.

Police spotted the car and alerted the Polair police helicopter, which tracked the vehicle as it sped across Adelaide's western suburbs.

The car crossed onto the wrong side of the road and overtook other vehicles before speeding into a busy intersection, where it tried to turn right and narrowly missed hitting cars that were waiting at the traffic lights opposite.

It was forced to swerve to a stop before pulling out and continuing its drive.

The driver took a major risk at a second intersection by cutting off a white van, which avoided hitting the car by slamming on its breaks.

At one point the car veered off the road and into a park before steering back onto the road.

In the final moments of the chase the car overtook a white vehicle and sped into cross traffic, where it was hit by a heavy truck.

The car spun out of control before smashing into The Lady Daly pub in the Adelaide suburb of Hindmarsh.

Police arrested the driver, from New South Wales, after he entered the pub and then tried to escape on foot.

Lady Daly owner David Limareff, 39, witnessed the car smash into the poles holding up his pub's veranda as he was opening the front doors at approximately 11am.

'I was opening the front doors on the corner and I saw the police car cross the road and thought I'd have a look to see what's going on,' Mr Limareff told MailOnline.

'I opened up our doors for the day's trade and I saw the truck clip the ute and basically saw it flying straight at me and I sort of leapt out of the way.

At one point the ute veered off the road and into a park

The car made its way through the park for a short time before steering back onto the road

'I raced out to see if the occupant of the car was OK and that's when I realised it wasn't a normal accident, when all the cop cars chasing it were piling in.'

The 27-year-old man tried to enter the pub through a side door but it was locked, so he went through a delivery door into the kitchen where two chefs were working.

'The chefs chased him into the beer garden and he just picked up one of the chairs to use at the two chefs, so they retreated quickly and allowed him to pass,' Mr Limareff said.

'I was just about to head back into the hotel when I saw him just casually walking past the bar.'

The man then exited the hotel and tried to escape on foot.

'He just went for a leisurely walk down Port Road so I grabbed one of the police officers,' Mr Limareff said.

'He probably thought he could just blend in nicely and walk away, he was just walking like he was going out for a stroll.'

Police started chasing the man down the street and he broke into a run, but was eventually apprehended.

Mr Limareff said between six and 12 police cars, marked and unmarked, arrived at the scene following the crash.

He added he is thankful the car didn't do any lasting damage to his business.

Western Adelaide Police chief inspector Kym Zander branded the arrested man an 'idiot' and said the situation could have had serious consequences

'The car physically didn't hit the building,' Mr Limareff said.

'The two posts holding up the veranda, they caught 800kg of vehicle and prevented the car from slamming in the front.'

Western Adelaide Police chief inspector Kym Zander said: 'This is a fairly serious situation that could have had far reaching consequences.

'If you or I or any member of our family had been in this vicinity this out of control car could have taken or severely injured anybody that was in the vicinity.

'Unfortunately it's because of these idiots that take these risks that we find ourselves with the consequences that we now face today.'
