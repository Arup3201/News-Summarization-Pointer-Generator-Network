At least five people were killed today when a powerful earthquake followed by a damaging tsunami struck the small Pacific nation of the Solomon Islands – where Prince William and his bride spent a holiday last September.

The major 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck the Santa Cruz islands, which are part of the Solomons, just 250 miles from the private island of Tavanipupu, where Prince William and Kate enjoyed a brief visit five months ago.

Waves of 1.5m struck the western side of the Santa Cruz Islands, smashing down at least three villages and destroying up to 50 homes.

Hospital officials in the local town 
of Lata said that five bodies – those of a boy aged about 10 and four 
elderly people – had been brought in and many other people were being 
treated for broken bones and cuts.

'We're expecting quite a few more casualties' said Mr Augustine Pilve, the hospital's director of nursing.

Reports from the region, lying to the
east of the Solomons capital, Honiara, were still coming in last night,
but Mr Pilve said he believed hundreds of people around Lata may have 
been affected by the tsunami which was stirred by the earthquake.

The Solomons police commissioner, Mr 
John Lansley, said police patrols were sifting through damaged villages 
looking for dead and injured residents.

'Sadly, we believe some people have 
lost their lives,' he said as the local hospital began counting the dead
who were being brought in.

This was some of the damage a tsunami and an earthquake inflicted on the Solomon Islands in 2007

When the quake hit, the Pacific 
Tsunami Warning Centre in Hawaii, noticing that waves had been 
generated, put out a widespread alert throughout the South Pacific, 
warning that a tsunami might strike the Solomons, Vanuatu, Nauru, Papua 
New Guinea, Tuvalu, New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and 
Samoa.

The warning resulted in thousands, 
including tourists, leaving their homes, hotels and places of work to 
flee to higher ground – in case a large wave came sweeping in.

In the Solomons capital, Honiara, 
people stood on hilltops looking out to sea, 'trying to observe if there
is a wave coming in,' said Mr George Herming, a spokesman for the Prime
Minister.

The earthquake was yet another 
reminder of the undersea danger that exists for nations on the so-called
Pacific 'Ring of Fire', an enormous zone of volcanic instability that 
encircles the Pacific Ocean.

The 'ring' embraces Indonesia in the 
west to the coast of Chile in the east in a 40,000 kilometre arc of 
seismic violence that unleashes earthquakes and volcanoes around the 
Pacific ring virtually daily.

The ring is actually an 
interconnected circle of cracks in the Earth's hardened upper crust 
which are under constant pressure from molten rock below.

Just how volatile – and dangerous – 
the region is was demonstrated on December 26, 2004, when a 9.4 
magnitude quake struck off Indonesia, unleashing tsunamis that smashed 
into Indian Ocean shorelines killing more than 220,000 people, including
149 Britons, and left millions homeless.

Atenia Tahu, who works for the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corp in Honiara, said most people were remaining calm.

'People around the coast and in the capital are ringing in and trying to get information from us and the National Disaster Office and are slowly moving up to higher ground,' Tahu said. 'But panic? No, no, no, people are not panicking.'

Dr. Rooney Jagilly, the medical superintendent at the National Referral Hospital in Honiara, said the hospital asked about half its 200 patients to leave and stay with families or friends as a precautionary measure because the hospital is located near the shoreline.

Those patients who weren't mobile enough to move stayed, but the hospital remained ready to evacuate them.

Jagilly said there had been no flooding and he hoped the hospital would return to normal on Thursday. He said his staff was ready to mobilize to Santa Cruz because the small hospital there has no doctor after the previous one recently died.

An official at the disaster management office in Vanuatu said there were no reports of damage or injuries there.

More than 50 people were killed and thousands lost their homes in April 2007 when a magnitude-8.1 quake hit the western Solomon Islands, sending waves crashing into coastal villages.

The Solomons comprise more than 200 islands with a population of about 552,000 people. They lie on the 'Ring of Fire' - an arc of earthquake and volcanic zones that stretches around the Pacific Rim and where about 90 percent of the world's quakes occur.

The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday's quake struck 81 kilometers (50 miles) west of Lata at a depth of 28.7 kilometers (17.8 miles).
