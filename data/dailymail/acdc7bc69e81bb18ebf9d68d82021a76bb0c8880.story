A drug addict burglar who scared to death a retired lecturer after he looted his home was jailed for 12 years today in a case which the judge said could 'make him weep'.

Career criminal Anthony Curry, 39, admitted manslaughter after he caused 88-year old great grandfather Christopher Proctor to have a fatal heart attack when he burgled his house in Lancashire.

As he saw the pensioner's body lying in the hallway, callous Curry then set fire to the Â£200,000 bungalow in Blackburn to cover up his crimes.

Police and firefighters were called to the raging inferno to find the charred remains of Cambridge educated Mr Proctor inside.

Accomplice: Curry's girlfriend Clare Randall was jailed for 2 years 7 months for her part in the burglary and attempted theft

A post mortem examination found he suffered from advanced heart disease and that his heart would not have been able to withstand the shock of the 3am break-in.

He also had no soot in his lungs, proving he had died before the fire started.

Curry was initially charged with murder but was cleared after he later admitted manslaughter, arson, burglary and attempted theft.

His girlfriend Claire Randall, 30, admitted burglary and two charges of attempted theft and was locked away for two years and seven months.

Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice Alistair MacDuff remarked: 'What a tragic case, this was lovely old man 88 years old, vulnerable and living alone - a retired lecturer with a degree from Cambridge, relatively well off, and who was targeted by people like you.

'It wasn't the first time you targeted this man. Well you say you are sorry, so you should be and I have read the impact statement from his daughter. I have read it three times now, it makes me want to weep.

'Here is grandfather, a great grandfather a beloved father lost to this family in the anguish that that it has heaped upon them because of you selfishness and your addiction to drugs.'

Preston Crown Court was told Mr Proctor described as am 'eccentric and well off' old man was a talented linguist and had lived at his home for 40 years.

He had graduated from Pembroke College at Cambridge University before taking up a teaching post at an Accrington School. Between 1958 until his retirement in 1985 he taught at the former Blackburn Technical College.

But it was feared news of his wealth was well known in the locality and Curry and his partner Clare Randall decided to rob him. Initially Curry sneaked into the house unbeknown to pensioner who was asleep in his downstairs bedroom.

Curry searched the bungalow for two and a half hours and stole Mr Proctor's bank card whist Randall waited outside on the old man's driveway as a lookout.

The pair then tried to withdraw cash from an ATM using the stolen cards but failed to get any money because Mr Proctor had changed his PIN number earlier that day.

Curry then returned to Mr Proctor's home alone to search for a more accurate PIN number. It is thought Mr Proctor woke up on the second occasion to find Curry who turned on his heels and fled.

In an attempt to get away, he slammed a door into Mr Proctor's face - fracturing the pensioner's nose and knocked him to the floor. He then suffered his fatal seizure.

Despite being unable to find a conclusive cause of death, a pathologist said the fear Mr Proctor had felt when he discovered Curry in his home, combined with the shock of having a door slammed in to his face, could have proved fatal.

Following the fire, officers recovered Mr Proctor's bank book and wallet which had been discarded in nearby drains. CCTV was recovered of Mr Proctor visiting a cash machine just hours before his death and he was changing his PIN number.

Spotted: In the afternoon before he died, Mr Proctor was last seen using a cash machine at Tesco cash machine at around 3pm in November last year

Police soon discovered Mr Proctor had been befriended by Curry, who then preyed on his vulnerability to steal money from him.

Officers later bugged the home Curry shared with Randall and secretly recorded them discussing different possible explanations for their actions.

Passing sentence the judge added: 'You broke into his house the two of you and were in there for two and a half house on the night.

'It is not known precisely what you did on the occasions and it will never fully be known because only you knew what happened but drawers had been opened and searched.

'The telephone jack had been removed from the wall probably on the first visit and you emerged two and a half hours later with a bag of spoils and most particularly his wallet and bank cards but he had changed his PIN number over recent days presumably because of people like you, he was worried that he would be taken for another ride.

'It has to be accepted that this gentleman's death was probably almost certainly caused by cardiac arrest out of fear and shock. He was relatively healthy otherwise from having heart disease. The Crown have accepted that he died during that second occasion but only you Curry knew the real truth.

'You proceeded to destroy his house by fire and in doing so succeeded in destroying evidence which would have been subject to forensic investigation - how wicked.

'In the impact statement it makes it clear the fire is a great part of this tragedy for the family having been unable to say goodbye to Mr Proctor. The whole house was destroyed having to be knocked down and rebuilt at massive cost.

'You spent some time together trying to create a story that would stand up. A story that regularly changed. You were doing your very best to cover your tracks.'

'Whatever happened this was far from being a murder case but difficult to imagine a worse case of manslaughter with more aggravating features, the vulnerability, the arson the burglary, the fire, you set fire to his house, you still attempted to use his bank card.

'This has been a dreadful case in many many ways but I'm moved by the way the family has composed themselves. I hope they think that justice has been properly done.'
