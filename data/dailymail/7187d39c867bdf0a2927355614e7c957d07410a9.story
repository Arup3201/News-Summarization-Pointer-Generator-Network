Arsenal have been handed a major injury boost by Olivier Giroud's return to full training.

The France international has been on the sidelines since sustaining an ankle injury against Everton on August 23.

But the centre-forward made his long-awaited return to full training at the club's London Colney HQ on Thursday  morning.

Giroud wasn't expected to be back in full training at least until the new year

He will now compete with Danny Welbeck for the lone centre-forward role in Arsene Wenger's starting XI.

The news comes as a huge boost to the Gunners manager, whose side has been ravaged by injuries this season.

Giroud joins Theo Walcott in regaining his fitness following a long-term spell on the sidelines.

However, Arsenal are still without key-men Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny through injury.
