Tory defector Douglas Carswell is on course to romp home as Ukip’s first Member of Parliament, a new poll suggested last night.

A survey of more than 1,000 voters in the Essex constituency of Clacton put support for Mr Carswell – who quit as its Conservative MP last week to stand for Ukip – on 56 percentage points, well ahead of the Tories on 24 points.

Labour is on 16 points while the Liberal Democrats are on a miserable two percentage points, according to the poll commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft.

‘Even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds, the likely outcome is clear,’ said Lord Ashcroft.

‘What happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled. As things stand, the indication is that Carswell could hold the seat, but perhaps with a reduced majority.’

Mr Carswell has claimed it does not matter if his defection to Ukip helps Ed Miliband into Downing Street – because there is no difference between Labour and the Tories.

Mr Carswell, who shocked Westminster by calling a snap by-election after leaving the Tories last week, said Mr Miliband would not be ‘that different’ from David Cameron as Prime Minister.

His remarks, amid Tory anger over his defection to Ukip, came after it was announced the by-election in Clacton would take place on October 9 – Mr Cameron’s 48th birthday.

A poll released today suggested Mr Carswell will easily hold the Essex seat. The Ukip candidate is backed by 56 per cent of voters in the constituency - 32 points ahead of the Tories.

The crunch electoral test comes just a week after the Tories' annual conference in Birmingham.

Mr Carswell will be the first person elected to Parliament for Ukip. The party's only previous MP, Bob Spink, did not seek a fresh mandate when he defected from the Tories in 2008. He lost his seat at Castle Point, Essex in 2010.

Mr Carswell had been Conservative MP for Clacton since 2010, having previously served as MP for Harwich from 2005 to 2010 before boundary changes.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has said a by-election win for his party in Clacton would signal a ‘landslide in British politics’. A Survation poll for The Mail On Sunday gave Ukip a massive 44-point lead over David Cameron's party.

But Mr Carswell said he was not concerned that his defection would damage the Tories.

He said: ‘I don’t fundamentally believe that on most of the macro issues, an Ed Miliband government would be that different from a Cameron government. Different cliques, same sofa.’

He said the former Labour minister James Purnell ‘started welfare’ and the Government’s education reforms were actually initiated by Labour peer Lord Adonis.

Mr Carswell added: ‘There are some very nice socialists. If it wasn’t for socialism we wouldn’t have the NHS. They have done some good things, the Left in this country.’

Mr Carswell also pledged to vote for a referendum if Mr Cameron was Prime Minister.

He said: ‘I can promise you if I’m a Member of Parliament in the run-up to 2017, Mr Cameron and his Whips if he’s still Prime Minister can count on me to help ensure the legislation goes through.

‘I give him that guarantee now. The Carswell guarantee. As for letting Labour in: in Clacton if you vote Ukip you’re going to get Ukip. So that argument doesn’t stack up here.’

A Government under Ed Miliband would not be 'that different' to one ran by David Cameron, Mr Carswell has claimed

Mr Carswell said he would not have left the Tories if he thought the party leadership was serious about change. He said the Tory Party had become the ‘property of a small clique’.

He said he visited a conference in March, attended by senior Government officials, who were dismissive of serious reform of the EU.

Mr Carswell said: ‘I thought the Government was serious about change. And I sat in rooms listening to some very senior people, who unlike me are not democratically accountable, who clearly decide things, and who were just contemptuously dismissive.

‘And when I raised very mild suggestions and put some questions, or even when I was just listening, they were smirkingly, eyeball-rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms.

‘There was almost a sense of ‘we know best’. And yes we’ve got to say these things to the voters because of course you know the Prime Minister has got to win the next election, because you know, rest assured, we don’t mean it and it’s not going to happen.

‘That was a key moment, and it’s a key moment I can talk about in fairly specific terms without breaching confidences. If I give you other key moments you’ll know who I’m talking about and that wouldn’t be fair.’ 

Mr Carswell holds a 44 point lead over the Conservatives in the former Tory safe seat of Clacton

The Tories have yet to announce their candidate for next month’s by-election.

London Mayor Boris Johnson brushed off suggestions he should put his name forward, telling LBC radio: ‘The first objection really, is that I've already whacked in the CV for Uxbridge. It would seem a bit eccentric.’
