Christmas Day is always a stressful time for parents. So spare a thought for Tania Sullivan, who has just celebrated the birth of her 12th child.

This year, between the frenzied opening of stockings and presents and preparing a full English breakfast for 14 as well as lunch with all the trimmings, Mrs Sullivan, 38, will have to make time to feed five-week-old Isobelle.

Fortunately, she is an expert at using her time efficiently as she and her husband, Mike, 39, both work full time, rather than relying on the state to bankroll their huge family, and the children are home educated.

And mum and dad make 14: Left to right are Joseph, two, Sid, six, Steph, 18, Michael with Libby, 14 months, Ben, 19, Caitlin, 13, with Anna, 14 months, Tania with baby Isobelle, Harry, nine, Eddie, seven, Paddy, five and Oliver, three

Growing brood: Tania and Michael now have seven sons and five daughters, ranging in age from five weeks to 19-years-old

‘Christmas Day is non-stop for us,’ said Mrs Sullivan. ‘It is a long day but we have a lovely time and the children are happy, which is so rewarding.

By the time all the younger children are in bed, Mike will have a Guinness, which is his little treat, and I might go for a glass of Baileys. But if I am really shattered it might end up being a cup of tea.’

The couple’s oldest child, Ben, is 19, followed by Steph, 18, and Caitlin, 13. Then there is Harry, nine, Eddie, seven, Sid, seven tomorrow, Paddy, five, Oliver, three, Joseph, two, and 14-month-old twins Libby and Anna. Isobelle arrived on November 21.

The day will begin in the small hours for Mrs Sullivan, when she gives Isobelle a couple of bottle feeds. At 5am she and her husband will get up to start preparing breakfast, which is kept warm in the oven until the children have opened their stockings.

Cooking the turkey begins at 8am, after which the family’s first present opening session takes place. With 150-or-so gifts to open, time has to be set aside after lunch to finish the process.

The smaller children have a nap mid-morning while mum puts the finishing touches to lunch, which is served around 1pm.

What's for lunch? Tania and Mike will prepare a full English for the family of 14 on Christmas Day, before serving up lunch with all the trimmings later on

With the last of the gifts opened and the wrapping paper tidied up by 5pm, a buffet is laid on for the family before they settle down to play games. By 6pm, the gruelling round of putting children to bed begins, lasting around 90 minutes. Mrs Sullivan then has a quick shower to freshen up and collapses on the sofa with a drink at 8pm.

The family budget for Christmas is around £2,000 – which includes around £200 on food and drink. Gifts this year include an iPad, books, cameras, toys and clothes vouchers.

Mr and Mrs Sullivan met when they were teenagers and married ten years ago. She used to work as a recruitment consultant but runs a website, www.largerfamilylife.com, which gives advice on how to run a large family.

Working from the couple’s £200,000 detached house, near Rochester in Kent, also allows her to home school the children.

Mr Sullivan is self-employed as a part-time joiner and helps out with the website and at home when he is not working.

When the festive season is over, the family will get back to its usual routine, which involves a £200 weekly food shop.

They are planning a two-month family road trip through France and Italy from April but hope to offset the cost with a book about the adventure. So, with each day already packed from end to end, do they plan to settle for a round dozen children? Not necessarily…

‘Having one more will not change our lives massively now,’ said Mrs Sullivan.
