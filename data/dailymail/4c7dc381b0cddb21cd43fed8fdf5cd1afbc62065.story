A feud has broken out between neighbours because seagulls are 'carpet-bombing' their houses with bird poo due to a retired nurse leaving out scones, pies and bread for the birds every day. 

Eileen Weston, 68, puts the food in a bird house in her back garden and throws whole slices on her garage roof.

She splashes out £20-a-week on bread and margarine for the animals and even gives them scones and sausage rolls.

Feed the birds: Eilleen Weston leaves two loaves of bread out for the seagulls every day

The twice-daily feed sees hundreds of seagulls, starlings, blue tits and sparrows flocking to her garden in a small residential street.

But her neighbours say the food brings in flocks of birds which splatter homes, cars and people with droppings.

Residents in Gloucester say they can’t even put their washing out for fear of birdstrikes,

They have repeatedly asked Eileen to stop feeding the birds and the local council say they could issue her with an Asbo.

Under fire: Despite feeding the birds Eileen has annoyed her neighbours by leaving food out

Hungry: Seagulls perch on top of houses along the street where Eileen and her angry neighbours live

But defiant Eileen said: 'Nothing will stop me feeding the birds. I love them. It makes me happy to see them.

'They are always saying on the telly how we need to feed the birds so I feed them twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

Furious: Pam Cooke has asked her neighbour to stop leaving out food for seagulls

'It is not my fault that the birds make a mess sometimes. I’m not in control of bird poo.

'All my neighbours needed to do was knock on my door and ask me to stop feeding the seagulls.

'I wouldn’t stop, but it’s not nice to have people talking about you behind your back.'

Neighbour Pam Cooke, 65, said: 'She throws whole slices of bread on the roof of her garage, and that’s when all the gulls come.

'It’s an absolute nightmare - every other day we’re getting carpet-bombed with bird poo.

'Despite polite requests she still feeds the gulls. Our washing, vehicles and houses are bombarded with disgusting mess from these birds.

'She is acting in a very antisocial manner, seagulls are unhygienic filthy animals. I don’t mind that she feeds the little birds - we quite often put worms or corn out for them.

'It looks like something out of Hitchcock’s The Birds. Even the window cleaner complains about the poo.

'Perhaps she could be given an Asbo to encourage her to stop feeding them, I know it has been done in the past.'

Mrs Cooke's husband Edward said: 'I no sooner wash my car and it is filthy again. I went around there to ask her to stop but she doesn’t seem to take any notice.'

Project Solace, the squad that tackles antisocial behaviour in Gloucester, said they could take action.

A spokeswoman said: 'If a person has been asked to stop feeding the birds and they keep on going then we could carry out a joint operation with Environmental Health.'

A Gloucester City Council spokeswoman added: 'People are entitled to feed the birds in their own garden but if there is an accumulation of waste or vermin is being attracted the council may investigate.'

Last year, three elderly women in Wiltshire were given an Asbos to halt twenty years of their pigeon-feeding antics.
