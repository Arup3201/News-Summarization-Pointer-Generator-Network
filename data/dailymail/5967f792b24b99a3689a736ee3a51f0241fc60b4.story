A student has set himself the goal of meeting every one of his 1088 Facebook friends for a cup of coffee.

Matt Kuleza, from Melbourne, has not seen many of his social media 'friends' for years but thought rather than delete them, he would try and catch up with one a day until he's met them all - a task that will take him about three years. 

The 28-year-old spoke with Daily Mail Australia about his motivation for the project, which he has dubbed 1000+ Coffees, and his related blog.

Coffee #4: Joshua Poly-Goldschläger (friends on Facebook since December 2013, 71 mutual friends). Matt (left) explains on his project's blog, 'Josh and I met last year at Meredith Music Festival. We were camping together thanks to mutual friends and I remember instantly hitting it off with him the moment we met.'

Coffee #5: Jason Waterfalls AKA Nick Bourke AKA Bourkey (friends on Facebook since June 2008, 145 mutual friends). Matt said on his blog, 'Bourkey is one of my best friends and we hang out every week, but neither of us have any idea exactly how and when we met, but it was around the time I was living in a warehouse in Abbotsford and having lots of parties.'

Coffee #7: Clementine Bastow (friends on Facebook 2.0 since November 2013, 46 mutual friends). 'Today Clem and I caught up on our families, chatted about pop-culture and the time she rapped Die Antwoord’s remix of ‘Orinoco Flow' to a room of gobsmacked LA-types,' said Matt.

'It’s a very simple idea, really. I literally just asked myself, "Who are these one thousand apparent friends I have?", who'd I accumulated over about seven years,' said Matt.

'I was just going to do a cull to get rid of people, but then I thought that I should see if I could get to know them instead. It seemed like a cool social experiment, and amazingly has changed my life for the better.'

Starting the project in early September, Matt has had at least one coffee date per day for the past three weeks, and has already met up with 23 of his Facebook- and now soon to be real- friends, with some interesting results.

'I've been keeping a very open mind. I caught up with an ex-girlfriend from five years ago, which went really well. We both have partners now, but we just slipped into old habits of chatting. I'm assuming other people psych themselves out over their relationships with other people, but I'm so glad that I have this catalyst to meet people,' said Matt.

'Everyone I've met up with has been interested in it. It's a basic idea but has already had such a positive effect on my life.'

Coffee #10: Juliana Park (friends on Facebook since May 2014, no mutual friends). Matt said on his blog, 'Today I caught up with the lovely Jules, a new friend that I met at university towards the end of last semester. Jules and I both took a class on World Religions and got chatting one day after she found out I was studying Korean.'

Matt said, 'Coffee #11: Rfc Tru aka Robert Coleman (friends on Facebook since September 2007, 84 mutual friends)Last night I strapped myself in for the experience of catching up with the hurricane of a human and old friend that I really need to make more time for, Robbie Coleman.'

Coffee #14: Sally Humble (friends on Facebook since September 2011, 53 mutual friends). 'Sally was in the year level above me in high school and also happens to be my sister’s best friend’s sister, so we had been friendly with each other for years.' said Matt on his project website.

Matt sees the meet-ups as less of an opportunity to talk about himself, and much more a way to hear about other people's lives.

'I guess I see myself as more in an interviewing role,' he said.

'The experiment is a type of document about other people as well as the experience of stepping out of comfort zones. Every person has something interesting and amazing to say.'

'I caught up with a friend from primary school who I haven't seen since 1998. He's an amazing professional photographer and is going to take me diving.'

'I've also had my taro read, which I've never done before. Really, this experience has just opened up a whole new universe of people that I wouldn't have been exposed to.'  

Matt has had a few snarky comments left on his blog, but he says that despite a little bit of tension, overwhelmingly the response has been supportive.

'The theme of the project is for me, and others, to step out of the prescribed role of social media, and to spark something different. It seems that social media has evolved into everyone staring at their screens instead of interacting with those who are right in front of them,' he said.

'I used to work in hospitality and I was always so intrigued by the groups of people who would sit at the table staring at their phones without being in the moment. Worse, they would put their phones on the table, waiting and ready for some fascinating development.' 

Despite being a full-time student, Matt has been offered two jobs by people he has met up with during the project. He is now working several days a week as a digital strategist working on social media campaigns, and is also about to start working for the School of Life, running workshops on having meaningful conversations.

'Both the jobs are pretty fitting to the whole theme of the experiment,' Matt said.

'I've had to start getting up two to three hours early each day to fit the coffee dates in, but even though I've got more on my plate now, I'm determined to keep going.'

'The whole process has just changed my life so completely, and has had such a positive impact.' 

Matt said on the 1000+ Coffees project:'Coffee #17: Cal Mero (friends on Facebook since October 2007, 14 mutual friends)This afternoon I had the absolute pleasure of catching up with my old friend from primary school, Cal Mero, someone I haven’t seen in thirteen years.'

Coffee #20: Kate Cake (friends on Facebook since March 2011, 36 mutual friends). 'Kate and I met through her excellent, self-proclaimed ‘whorecore’ band Toxic Lipstick in 2010.' said Matt on his blog

Coffee #18: Ella Waimarie (friends on Facebook since November 2010, 29 mutual friends) 'Ella and I met back in 2010 at a bar she was working at in Fitzroy that I used to occasionally DJ at. She would often give me extra beers in exchange for music requests' said Matt on his blog
