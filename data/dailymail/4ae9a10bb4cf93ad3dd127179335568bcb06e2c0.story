A schoolgirl was found hanged in woodland by her friends after they formed a late-night search party using the torch function on their mobile phones to find her, a inquest heard today.

Josie Herniman's three best friends discovered the 15-year-old's body after her distraught mother raised the alarm when she failed to return home.

The trio searched streets around her home looking for Josie, before Adele Walker flagged down her father Craig's car and they headed to local woodland.

The girls used the lights on their mobile phone to pick through the undergrowth before eventually discovering Miss Herniman's body. 

Paramedics attempted to resuscitate Miss Herniman but she was declared dead at the scene. 

In a written statement to the inquest, Mr Walker told the court: 'I asked Adele where they were going and she replied heard towards the woods.

'Adele asked for the group to be dropped off in the entrance way. I turned around and parked.

'I walked quickly towards the woods, as I looked I could see and hear the children's voices in the woods.

'I could see them because they were all using their mobile phones as a source of light.'

Mr Walker added: 'As I went into the woods I started to shout 'Adele where are you?' I heard a child shout "she's dead".

'At this point I was walking through the woods towards the children screaming. I was there for approximately one minute before I saw the mobile phone lights.

'I walked past Adele and asked where Josie was, and she replied "she is dead".

'I ascended a steep bank, maybe about five or six foot high. I could see her bag at the bottom of a tree.' 

The inquest at Flax Bourton Court, near Bristol, heard Josie was found in Oldmixon Woods, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, at 9.29pm, in September 29 last year.

The inquest heard that Miss Herniman had an argument with her boyfriend on the day of her death, but, this was nothing out of the ordinary and she was 'no more upset than a young girl would be'.

Detective Sergeant Martin Longden, who investigated Miss Herniman's death, said: 'One of the things that was evident through really strong grounds on social media was the suggestion Josie was being bullied.

'Myself and my team, throughout the whole investigation, found no evidence whatsoever.'

He added: 'It became very clear very quickly from interviewing her friends that she was a well-loved individual by both her parents.

'She had a large circle of friends and was well thought of.'

DS Longden continued: 'Josie had revealed to some close friends that she may have suffered some form of unwarranted sexual advances by an individual who she never disclosed.

'It reportedly happened about the same time of Halloween when this occurred. My conclusions were that you have a 15-year-old girl who is intelligent, well loved and popular. 

'Myself, and my team, have really struggled to identify a specific cause as to why Josie would actually go forward and go through with an incident like this.'

Reaching a narrative conclusion, Coroner Maria Voisin, said there was no evidence that Miss Herniman had intended to take her own life.
