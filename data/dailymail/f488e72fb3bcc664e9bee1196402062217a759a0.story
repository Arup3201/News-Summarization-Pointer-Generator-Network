A couple have been left devastated after they spent 'every penny' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in.

Marie Louise Campbell, 45, was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on November 17 last year and putting in a £145,000 offer which was accepted the following day.

But when she and her fiance David Alonzi, 46, received the keys and tried to move in last month, they were shocked at what they found.

When they entered the property Ms Campbell said she was hit with a smell so strong it could 'knock you out'

She claims she was hit with a foul pong that could 'knock you out' when she picked up the keys and unlocked the front door.

Faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed.

Horrified Ms Campbell and her fiance, David Alonzi, 46, believe the property in Crossgates, Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer.

Ms Campbell said: 'When we got the brochure and viewed (the house), it looked fantastic, beautifully presented. It ticked all the boxes of what David and I were looking for.'

After there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in Scotland as the missives - she received the keys on January 22, just over 10 weeks after viewing the property.

'When we got the keys we could not believe what was in front of us. We opened the front door and it was cat p*** I could smell.

'I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were yellow marks at the door entrance. I went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out.

'There are poo and pee stains on the terracotta carpet. It was absolutely saturated wet with pee. We still have all the evidence locked in the garage.

'The carpet was wet. It was soaking. It went through to the underlay which was like a baby's nappy.

Ms Campbell and her fiance David Alonzi believe the property in Dunfermline, Fife, was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in

Floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell

'We lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet. We then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists.

'We couldn't understand how bad the hallway smelled until we cut two feet of plaster from the floor up in the hall.'

She believes the former owner of the house, a prison officer, was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12-hours shifts.

She spoke to neighbours who said the two dogs - believed to be boxers - and three cats did not get out very often.

The former owner allegedly told her that the property was 'a wee bit dodgy' but that she would make it 'immaculate' for them to move in.

Richard Peters, a house surveyor working for Allied Surveyors Scotland, said he checked the property on October 21 last year.

He said: 'It wasn't like that when I saw it. I would say at the time that there was no evidence of squelching underfoot or evidence of these horrible substances in accessible areas when I saw the house.'

The couple have spent their life savings and say they cannot afford to live or fix the property properly - which they estimate would cost at least £10,000. 

The couple have now been forced to rent a flat for £500 each month, as they cannot move into the 'health hazard'.

Scottish property law differs to that in the rest of the UK. Once a formal written offer has been accepted in writing, both parties are bound to the transaction by contract.

Failure by one party to adhere to this written agreement, known as the 'missives' procedure, can mean they must pay the other party a hefty compensation fee.

A sale contract is commonly known as 'concluded missives' - with the missives being the correspondence which completes the transaction.

Across the rest of the UK, either party can withdraw from the transaction up until the point when a contract is officially signed.

Ms Campbell said: 'I feel helpless because I can't do a thing.

'I just can't see myself ever settling in there after everything we've gone through with all the deception and lies we've been told.

'We are really struggling to do anything about this. We are currently renting a flat costing us £500 a month.

'We cannot move into this house in that condition, it's an absolute health hazard.

'Even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach, we couldn't get rid of the terrible smell.'

Adrian King, of selling agent Remax, Dunfermline branch, added: 'The house was marketed by office and viewed and inspected by the purchaser who then preceded to purchase the property.

'Any deterioration in the property which may have occurred in the intervening period between the inspection and purchase, is a matter to be resolved between the respective purchasers, vendors and solicitors.'

Kate McQuillan, understood to be the former owner, was not available for comment. 

Her solicitors sent a letter to the solicitors of Marie Louise Campbell and David Alonzi, which states:

‘With regards to the carpets and floorboard, [Ms Quillian] is very upset at the allegation the dogs had been urinating through the whole house.

‘She offered to touch bits up in the kitchen where the dogs slept and your client told her not to bother. 

‘Our client will not be meeting the cost of replacement floorboards. The caveat emptor applies.’
