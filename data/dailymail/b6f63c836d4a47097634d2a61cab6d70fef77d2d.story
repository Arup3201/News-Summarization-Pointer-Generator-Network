Eight people have died and 10 people were injured in a plane crash in Bolivia.

The plane, flying from Trinidad to Riberalta, near the Brazilian border, exploded after hitting the runway at an angle in the pouring rain on Sunday, witnesses claim.

A nine-year-old boy, three women and four men were declared dead after being rushed to hospital.

One of the dead, Shirley Ojopi, a primary
school teacher, had rushed to catch that flight in order to attend her 
mother's funeral, reports claim.

Devastating: Dozens of witnesses and a soldier rush to put out the flames and rescue the victims on Sunday

The pilot and co-pilot survived but remain in a critical condition.

The cause of the crash is not yet known but police claim the heavy rain and poor visibility may have been a factor.

Local reports describe a huge plume of smoke erupting from the aircraft when it crashed at 16.15pm local time (8pm GMT) as the 18 people on board screamed for help inside.

But seconds later the vessel exploded.

Dozens of people rushed from the airport to break the victims free from the plane - and put out the fire - in the pouring rain.

Police and three ambulances arrived to take all 18 passengers to hospital where eight were declared dead.

The remaining 10 - including pilot Kevin Roca Alpire and co-pilot Cecilia Tapia Salina - are still in a serious condition suffering from severe burns and post-traumatic stress.

Mr Alpire and Ms Salina were later transferred to a specialist hospital in the city of Guayaramer√≠n, 55 miles from Riberalta.

Senior doctor Miguel Batista told local media two of the survivors have suffered second-degree burns, adding: 'Considering the nature of the crash, it is a miracle there are survivors.'

The regional minister, Miguel Ruiz, lamented the lack of facilities to rescue the victims.

He said: 'We don't have the necessary tools. We have the overwhelming support of the people of Riberalta but they could not do much for the people on the plane. We need a fire engine with equipment to cut open a plane to be able to act quicker.'

'Investigation': President Evo Morales called for a thorough investigation into the flight from Trinidad to Riberalta, near the border of Brazil, that killed a child, three women and four men on Sunday

A spokesman for the Bolivian airline Aerocon said: 'The important thing at this moment in time is not the cause of the accident. Our priority is human lives. The reasons behind the crash will not be known for a good few days. Any reports about the causes are just rumours, not official statements.'

Speaking to Agence France-Presse, he added: 'As they were landing, on touchdown, the plane had some kind of problem that led to fire.

'The people who died sustained multiple injuries and burns.'

Families arrived at the airport to identify their relatives at 5.30pm local time.

President Evo Morales expressed his condolences to the relatives of the victims and ordered 'a thorough investigation'.
