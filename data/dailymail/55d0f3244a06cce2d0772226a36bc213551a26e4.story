A dangerously ill teenage boy was told he had an anxiety disorder and depression for more than a year before doctors finally realised he was actually suffering from liver failure.

Shockingly, David Acott, 16, only received an accurate diagnosis after he was rushed to hospital suffering from acute liver failure with yellow eyes and bloody urine.

By the time he was finally found to have liver failure, he was dangerously ill and had to have a life-saving transplant within a week of his diagnosis.

David Acott, 16, was told for more than a year that he had depression and anxiety before doctors eventually realised that he actually had liver failure. He is pictured with his sister just days before his diagnosis

His mother, Janet Acott, 47, from North Norfolk, told MailOnline: ‘The speed of it was mind-blowing – to go in seven days from him being okay and having “depression” to getting a new liver.

‘But, it was good to know there was a reason he was feeling so awful.’

When David was 13 he started to show signs of depression.

He started to vomit in the mornings and not to want to go to school.

He had recently lost his grandmother and moved house and school so his mother and doctors thought he was suffering from depression.

His condition gradually got worse until he was missing a lot of school and was often too ill to get out of bed.

Ms Acott, a
 primary school teacher, said: ‘He would get so upset before school he would be sick. He was in an awful state and he was just 
not engaging with life.’

David saw a counsellor and was then prescribed antidepressants which finally caused his condition to improve slightly.

David was only diagnosed when he turned yellow and had to be placed in an induced coma in hospital while waiting for an emergency liver transplant

David (pictured with his mother, Janet) now knows that his depression and anxiety were caused by his underlying liver condition which meant copper was building up in his body

His mother said: ‘He was so desperate to be better and it seemed to improve. We thought we had finally cracked it.’

Ms Acott says that, at this point, she believed her son was suffering from depression and anxiety as it never crossed her mind that there could be another underlying cause for his illness.

However, everything changed just after David finished school for the year in July 2012.

During the first week of the holidays the family went on a caravan holiday.

Ms
 Acott says that before they left she noticed that David’s stomach was 
slightly swollen but that she did not think a lot of it.

Wilson's disease is a disorder which causes the body to have higher than normal levels of copper.

An overload of copper is poisonous and can cause damage to the liver, brain and other organs.

The copper overload is caused by a genetic defect that prevents the liver from being able to metabolise copper.

If Wilson's disease is diagnosed early enough it can be treated effectively.

But, if it is not treated, it is always fatal.

The build up of copper in the liver causes cirrhosis and eventually liver failure.

In the brain, it can lead to confusion, tremors and clumsiness.

It can also cause personality changes, anxiety, depression, psychosis and suicidal thoughts.

In extreme cases, patients may require a life-saving liver transplant.

She told MailOnline: ‘It was the sort of thing only a mother would notice. I didn’t think much of it but as his mum I noticed it.’

She explained that a few days later, he was very sick and vomited repeatedly but that she was not overly concerned because he had a history of being sick in the mornings so it was not particularly unusual.

However, when he returned from the holiday his eyes started to turn yellow.

Ms Acott took him straight to the doctors where a urine sample was taken and she was horrified to see that it was red with blood.

The next day he had blood tests and was sent straight to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.

Doctors at the local hospital were so worried that they had him transferred to King’s College Hospital, in London, within hours of arriving.

Ms Acott says that once they arrived at King's, doctors spent 24 hours attempting to establish what was wrong with David before eventually diagnosing him with Wilson’s disease.

Ms Acott said: ‘When we were given the diagnosis and looked up the condition it suddenly all clicked and everything made sense.’

Since his transplant, David (pictured with his mother, Janet) has made a full recovery and is running triathlons

She was told David would need an emergency liver transplant and as he was becoming delirious he was put in an induced coma.

Incredibly, because he was put on a super-urgent transplant list, he was given a transplant just 48 hours later.

His mother said: ‘We feel blessed that he got a liver. It’s the ultimate gift and he wouldn’t have survived otherwise.

‘His condition was critical – he was being kept alive by machines.’

She added: ‘We were lucky in a way as we never lived with Wilson’s disease and he now no longer has it because the transplant was effectively a cure.

‘It has all worked out of the best really – although losing your own liver is traumatic he was lucky not to have to live with the disease.

‘Now I just feel sad that he has missed out on a normal teenage-hood.’

David spent a month at King’s College Hospital before he was well enough to be transferred back to his local hospital.

While he was in London his parents were offered accommodation close to the hospital by Ronald McDonald House Camberwell.

The house has 24 en-suite bedrooms as well as a kitchen and garden and it offers free accommodation to the families of children being treated at King’s College Hospital.

It can provide accommodation for any length of time – some parents say just for a few days while others stay for a year.

Ms Acott said: ‘They were fantastic – they provided a room in the hospital and then they provided a little flat.

Ms Acott says she is not angry at David's misdiagnosis but that she is just sad that he missed out on having a normal teenage-hood. David is pictured (right) before his illness with his brother, Howard

‘It was so important – it gave us a home in London.’

David is now much better – he has to take anti-rejection medication but he has taken part in a triathlon and is at college.

Ms Acott told MailOnline: ‘He is trying to build-up his fitness now.

‘The illness has made him a different person – since the operation he is much happier and a nicer person to do things with.

‘Hopefully that is because his body is no longer poisoning itself so he feels better.'
