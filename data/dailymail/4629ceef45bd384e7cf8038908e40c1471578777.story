The principal of a high school in Dickinson, North Dakota, has been arrested and charged with deliberately setting it ablaze.

Trinity High School caught fire in the early hours of Monday morning and so much damage was caused that classes have had to be moved elsewhere for the rest of the school year.

Thomas Sander, 30, was charged on Tuesday with arson and endangerment by fire, both Class B felonies. Both felonies carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison.

Hired as principal last July, Sander is being kept in custody at the South West Multi-County Correctional Facility, according to the Dickinson Police Department.

Students have been given the week off while officials decide how to proceed for the rest of the school year, reports the Bismarck Tribute.

Trinity’s 253 students in grades 7-12 are expected to resume classes on Monday in a combination of facilities belonging to Dickinson Public Schools and Dickinson State University.

TMI, a laminate manufacturer in Dickinson, has also offered space for administration offices.

‘The outpouring of support from the community and the state has been phenomenal,’ said Dickinson Catholic Schools President Steve Glasser.

‘Our No. 1 priority right now is to teach our kids.’

Four fire trucks, three utility vehicles and 29 firefighters battled the fire from 1:15 am on Monday for two hours until they had it under control.

The front office of the school, which opened in 1961, had the most fire damage, with structural damage in the library above the office.

The rest of the school suffered significant smoke damage.

Glasser said that officials don’t even know if they will be able to be in the building for next year.

‘We want as best we can that in a few weeks there’s some sense of normalcy for our faculty and students,’ Glasser said.
