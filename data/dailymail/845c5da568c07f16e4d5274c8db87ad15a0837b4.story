Two teenagers were arrested on Christmas Eve for stabbing a nativity donkey 12 times and forcing it to miss its annual show.

Cheeky the donkey, who is 22 years old, was due to star in the Christmas show at Greenmeadow Farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, until she was knifed in the night.

Police have been hunting the cruel attackers since the knife assault in November and  two 17-year-old boys were arrested last night.

The mare was left with 16 deep stab wounds to her abdomen, hind legs and neck just days before the nativity show where she would be cheered by children.

Two teenagers have been arrested for stabbing Cheeky the nativity donkey at a farm in South Wales 

She was stitched up and forced to view the nativity from the wings as she received treatment. 

Workers at the community farm are in shock and said they were 'really disturbed' by the senseless violence. 

Manager Elizabeth Burns said: 'It was abhorrent that someone could do this to an innocent animal - especially before the nativity.

'As well as being upset that Cheeky has suffered we are really disturbed. Our focus is on monitoring Cheeky and nursing her back to health.

'It is a shame that we are having to hide Cheeky away while she gets better because her appearance could upset the children who visit the farm at this time of year.

'But the show had to go on and all the other animals performed well without their friend Cheeky.'

Cheeky was the only animal injured at the farm, despite sharing a paddock with two other donkeys.

Gwent Police have now incorporated regular night patrols and the farm has increased their security.

A Police spokesman said: 'We have arrested two male suspects aged 17 who have been bailed pending phone and forensic examinations.

'We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information about the attack to contact us.'

Cheeky has always been the star at the annual nativity show at Greenmeadow Farm in Cwmbran, South Wales - but this year has been forced to give it a miss
