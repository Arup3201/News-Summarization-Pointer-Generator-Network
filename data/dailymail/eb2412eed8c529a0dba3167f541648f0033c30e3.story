A pregnant mother who had an unexpected delivery on her bathroom floor ended up giving birth to a daughter who tipped the scales at 4.01 kilograms.

It was a day full of surprises for Peta Muller and her husband Craig who welcomed their second child April Joy Muller after keeping her gender a secret during pregnancy until she arrived.

The 35-year-old went into labour on Thursday morning and gave birth to her healthy daughter just 13 minutes after her water broke inside their Wollongong home, 82 kilometres south of Sydney.

‘As soon as my water broke, I knew I had the urge to push,’ Mrs Muller told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I told my husband I couldn’t make it to the car so he quickly called triple-0. My sister Chloe was with us and by the time she could help, the baby’s head was already out.

‘It was overwhelming – everything happened so quickly. Craig was getting our daughter Mia ready for day-care while making coffee for my sister when my water broke in the bathroom.

‘I didn’t feel scared or frightened but I remember looking around the room to find Craig. But it happened in the comfort of our home and I never once felt uneasy or could ask for anything more.’

With their bags packed and a checklist ready to go, the couple had plans to deliver their second daughter in hospital but things took a different turn - and fast.

‘A few weeks ago, I told our midwife that I had this strange feeling that I might not make it to the hospital but I’m glad I had that conversation with her,' she said.

Baby April tipped the scales at 4.01 kilograms - she was delivered inside her family home unexpectedly

‘She gave me advice and warned that it was much safer to deliver the baby at home than the side of the road – so we were quite aware of what to do this morning.

‘Craig cut the umbilical cord after the ambulance arrived less than 15 minutes later. They were really good and they took me to the hospital at around 7am so I could deliver the placenta.'

Welcoming their second daughter into the world, the mother of two said April’s weight also came as a surprise to the family.

'We didn't anticipate a four kilo baby so I had no idea how heavy she was until Craig placed her into my arms,' Mrs Muller told Daily Mail Australia. 

‘We hadn't decided on a name either because we didn’t know what sex she was until she arrived but as soon as Craig said "April" - we knew that was her name.

‘It was on our list of names that we had shared a few days earlier. April's middle name Joy is named after my mother-in-law and our midwife’s middle name happened to be Joy as well.'

Despite it was her first home birth, Mrs Muller said it was a worthwhile experience to consider for other mums

Despite it being her first home birth, Mrs Muller said it was a worthwhile experience to consider for other mothers.

‘It was a really nice delivery and we were lucky to enough to arrive at the hospital around 7am and check out by midday,’ she said. 

‘It was a completely different birthing experience compared to my first daughter who didn’t arrive until four and a half hours later.

'There's the comfort and safety of giving birth at the hospital but it's definitely an option to look into. Although it was messy and unexpected - it was definitely a pleasant experience.'
