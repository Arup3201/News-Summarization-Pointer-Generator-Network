Tragic: Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, was killed in Sangin, Afghanistan by a single gunshot to the ribcage fired by the sniper from a British patrol base, an inquest heard

Soldiers directing an Army sniper who shot dead a British military policeman did not know other troops were stationed in the area, it was claimed yesterday.

Lance Corporal Craig Knight said he 'felt sick' after realising that the marksman had accidentally gunned down a comrade, an inquest heard.

The troops mistakenly thought Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, was a Taliban fighter burying improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Sangin, Afghanistan.

Unknown to them, he was on the roof of a new observation post, codenamed N30.

L/Cpl Pritchard, from Eastbourne,  Sussex, was killed by a single gunshot to the ribcage fired by the sniper from a patrol base 750 yards away.

Coroner Alan Craze said there was something 'systematically wrong' if three troops with the marksman, Lance Corporal Malcolm Graham, of The Royal Scots Borderers, the 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, were unaware of the existence of the lookout.

He also raised concerns that none of the men – L/Cpl Knight, Rifleman Ainsley Nash and Rifleman Nathan Bennett, all of 4th Battalion The Rifles – knew N30 was on the other side of a Restricted Fire Line, meaning they needed to permission to shoot at targets there.

Rfl Nash told the inquest that at 7.45pm on the evening of  the shooting, he spotted two figures while using thermal imaging equipment.

He said he 'assumed' they were on the road and added: 'I didn’t know about N30. I hadn’t been told it was there.'

Radio communications between different parts of the base were 'very difficult' but the men were ordered not to fire warning shots, the inquest heard.

Instead, they were told to fire illuminating flares.

But the inquest heard that the soldiers fired up to five warning shots because they believed the unidentified men were an imminent threat to life.

They did not realise they needed permission to do this, Rfl Bennett told the court.

Then L/Cpl Graham arrived at the sangar,  a protected position attached to the patrol base, with section commander Corporal Jonathan Dolton.

He set up his .338 calibre sniper rifle before firing several shots 30 seconds apart.

Shortly afterwards, they heard the words ‘Man down’ transmitted over the radio.

Rfl Bennett told the inquest at Eastbourne Town Hall:  'L/Cpl Knight sat down and said he felt sick.

'The sniper then said, "Don’t tell me we have been shooting at our own blokes".

'I said we could not have been as there was no one near the road.'

Cpl Dolton said the 'previous guys' manning the sangar should have told L/Cpl Knight and his men that a new observation post had been set up during the handover.

The hearing continues.
