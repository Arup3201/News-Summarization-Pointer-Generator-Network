An engineer employed at the home of Bill and Melinda Gates has been charged with possession of child porn after he was discovered to have more than 6,000 images depicting rape and sexual abuse.

Rick Allen Jones, 51, of Seattle, allegedly had thousands of images stashed on his home computer, according to court documents this week. 

According to prosecutors, the engineer had shared the images using his Gmail account.

Investigators were able to identify some of the children in the images, according to Kiro TV. 

Police began to investigate Jones in 2013 after tracking him down from a sordid image which was posted online.

According to Seattle PI, the image showed the sexual exploitation of two young boys.

Cops went to look for him at his home in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle in March.

Jones was finally tracked down to his workplace at the tech billionaire's $147-million-dollar, waterfront estate in Medina, Washington. 

He was interviewed in a security office at the estate by detectives, according to Seattle PI. 

While he was being interviewed, police went into his home with a search warrant and found more than 6,000 child porn images.

Among the horrific images, were photographs showing the  rape of a boy around the age of ten and the rape of a girl of the same age.

None of the alleged crimes took place at the Gates' home. The Microsoft founder has not released a statement on the allegations against Jones. 

It is not clear if he is still employed at the mansion.

Jones has not been jailed but was ordered to stay away from children, according to reports. He is due to appear in court in the coming days.
