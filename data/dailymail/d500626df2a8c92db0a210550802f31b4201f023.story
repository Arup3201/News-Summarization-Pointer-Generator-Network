A VIP service is to be held at Westminster Abbey to recognise the taxman's work collecting revenue.

HM Revenue and Customs chief executive Lin Homer has invited guests to a VIP event at the Abbey on September 23 where guests including staff, civil servants and partners will join to pay tribute to the taxman's work.

Ms Homer, who is the former boss of UK Borders Agency (UKBA), has recently been criticised regarding the huge payout the Government has been required to make to a U.S. defence firm following a failed UKBA IT project.

An HMRC spokesman told The Sun it was not paying for the Abbey and said the VIP event would help boost staff morale.

But the plan has been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, which told the paper: 'HMRC got 5.5million tax bills wrong last year.

'The last thing they need is a day out at the Abbey.'

Last year HMRC brought in more than £500 billion in tax revenue for the first time.

Ms Homer took up her position with HMRC following her departure from UKBA in 2011.

However, her performance during her time with UKBA has been called into question recently with news taxpayers have been landed with a £500million bill for a ‘catastrophic’ IT project intended to protect our borders.

An arbitration tribunal ruled the way the Home Office had terminated the contract for the shambolic eBorders scheme was unlawful.

Defence firm Raytheon will now pocket £223million of public money, including £50million in damages.

The settlement is in addition to the £260million the Government had spent by the time Raytheon was fired in July 2010 with the journey-logging system in disarray. Legal fees are expected to push the final bill to half a billion pounds.

It is to be the subject of a hearing by the home affairs select committee of the Commons, chaired by Labour's Keith Vaz.

He recently said the huge bill was a 'catastrophic result'.

'It is now clear that the UKBA didn’t know what they wanted from the eBorders programme.

‘We will want to hear further from Lin Homer, the then head of the UKBA, as to why she sanctioned such a defective agreement.’
