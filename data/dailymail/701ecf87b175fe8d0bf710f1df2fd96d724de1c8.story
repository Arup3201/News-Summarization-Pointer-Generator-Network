A couple who sent a barrage of emails and letters to their children’s school have been strongly criticised by a High Court judge.

The unnamed French couple were described as ‘foolish, overbearing and demanding’ after swamping independent Hall School, Wimbledon, south west London, with complaints that verged on the ridiculous.

In one complaint the mother – who sent most of the communication – said she was unhappy that their six-year-old daughter had been scored an A and not an A+ in a spelling test.

Claim: A judge at the High Court in London, pictured, has rejected a damages claim brought by an 'overbearing' couple against a school, after it asked their children to be taken out

In another, she wrote about her concerns over the 'unhygienic' position of her son’s water bottle in the classroom.

The school was left no choice but to ask the parents to take the children out of the school, sparking the legal battle in which the parents claimed a breach of contract.

However, taking the side of the school, judge Jeremy Richardson said their behaviour ‘went well beyond the realms of even the most zealous, some might say pushy, parents’.

Describing the ‘enduring nightmare’ that the school suffered at their hands, Judge Richardson said: 'The focus of any school should be on the education and welfare of the children who attend it. Of course, parents need to play a full role and take a keen interest in their children. That is right and proper.

'But equally , parents must - and most do - appreciate that school is a community which needs to be permitted to get on with its principal task of educating children collectively. No school should be bombarded with unwarrantable demands by parents.

'Teaching and other staff bear a high responsibility in what they do. Looking over their shoulders for fear of litigious parents is one aspect of their professional lives they could well do without.

'It is also of critical importance that teachers and others of whatever rank feel able to express their views with candour.'

The couple were seeking £50,000 in damages from the school, claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution.

But the businessman and his wife, who cannot be identified to protect their two sons and daughter whom the judge described as 'delightful', were the 'authors of their own misfortune', the judge said.

He said the meddling parents' case was unseemly and without one shred of believable evidence to support it.

Tensions between the parents and staff worsened when headteacher Tim Hobbs insisted on being present during meetings between them and teachers.

But it was at a subsequent parents' evening last summer when the couples' behaviour left staff 'visibly shaken'.

The couple confronted teachers, kept 
one member of staff in discussion for 45 minutes and left two senior 
members of staff extremely upset.

The judge brushed aside the father’s insistence that the meeting had been simply 'lively', and described both the mother and father's conduct as 'appalling'.

Headteacher Tim Hobbs had then asked for the children to be withdrawn - or 
they would be expelled - as the relationship between the family and the 
school had broken down.

He said the children must leave 
through no fault of their own, with the next term’s fees waived and 
deposits returned, due to the irretrievable breakdown in trust.

Mr Hobbs agreed to write supportive 
references for the boys to the head of nearby Donhead School, Chris 
McGrath, but did not, as was claimed, say he would not disclose 
information about the parents if asked, as it would have been 
professionally negligent to have done so.

The judge rejected the couple’s 
allegation that Mr Hobbs had conspired with Mr McGrath, resulting in the
 boys being refused a place.

The school, not pictured, was accused of back-tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn (file photo), but this was rejected by the High Court

'There was no cover-up nor conspiracy 
nor anything else untoward. To suggest Mr Hobbs and Mr McGrath were 
bare-faced liars was frankly outrageous. They leave this court as honest
 and honourable men, as they arrived.'

The judge said that most parents would have been 'absolutely delighted' with the school’s observation that the couple’s children were a 'credit to you both' and there were no concerns for their future development either academically or socially.

Instead, the parents 'viewed everything in a self-centred self-contained artifice as though no-one else but them and their children mattered'.

'They interfered and meddled with the school and made unwarranted demands. Of course, all parents want the best for their children. Parents at fee-paying schools rightly demand the best but the school must be allowed to be a school.

'The conduct of the parents far exceeded the worst excesses of normal concerned parents by a considerable margin. I can well believe their domineering and demanding conduct became an enduring nightmare for the school.

'This parental misconduct - and it was misconduct - was such a shame as, whatever their failings, their children are a delight and were much liked by the staff at the school.

'If only the parents had been sensible, restrained and interested in their children’s progress, and there was progress, instead of being foolish, overbearing and demanding, events would have been, I am sure, to the advantage of all their children.'

He added: 'Whichever way one looks at this case from a legal viewpoint, there is simply not a viable case against the defendant. There was no breach of contract whatever. There was a variation of an extant contract to bring it to an end.'

After the ruling in London, Mr Hobbs said: 'We are very glad at the outcome. We don’t think it should ever have come to this stage and we are very glad that the children are settled in another school and are doing well.'

The parents declined to comment.
