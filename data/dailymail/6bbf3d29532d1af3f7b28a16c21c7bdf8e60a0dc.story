Joe Marler used to put the All Blacks on a pedestal. He doesn’t now.

The Harlequins prop believes England have shattered the world champions’ aura and can beat them here — as long as they rediscover the ability to catch.

Going into this three-Test series, the tourists wanted to deconstruct the myth of Kiwi invincibility. Steve Hansen’s team won all 14 matches they played in 2013 and have lost only once since their 2011 World Cup triumph, at Twickenham in December 2012.

Belief: Joe Marler is confident that England are close to shattering New Zealand's aura of invincibility

Last week, England’s under-strength side went to Eden Park and were not behind on the scoreboard until the 70th minute — or at any time when they had 15 men on the field. The outcome was a 20-15 win for the All Blacks, but the moral victory belonged to Stuart Lancaster’s men, who dominated in many aspects.

Marler produced a superb performance at loosehead as England’s pack gained supremacy in the scrum and had the upper hand in many of the collision areas. He was left with the conviction that the Kiwi players are mere mortals who crack under extreme pressure.

‘We went into the game having spent the build-up trying to get rid of this All Black myth or aura of how they are invincible,’ said England’s No 1. ‘We respect them as a team and know they have several world-class players — and they are world champions so we respect them for that. But Saturday helped us even further to realise, “Actually, we can go toe to toe with these guys”. Now we just need to go that extra step.’

Moral victory: Although they lost the first Test, Stuart Lancaster's England side were dominant and impressive

Marler was not among the players with close-quarters experience of seeing New Zealand beaten, having not featured in the record 38-21 triumph at home 18 months ago. Instead, he had continued to nurture the belief that Kiwi supremacy was just a fact of his sport.

He said: ‘I’ve always looked to the All Blacks as year in, year out the best team in the world and you just automatically think they have the best players in the world from one to 15. But when you break it down and look at them as individuals and collectively, there are 15 blokes on a field trying to do the same as you. A lot of boys in their team are world class, and we respect that, but we have to go out there and give it our best shot.’

Despite being without so many leading players, that is what England did at Eden Park and cracks in the black edifice were exposed. The aftermath of the tense series opener has been marked by Kiwi accusations that the tourists set out to slow down the match in order to negate the home side’s high-tempo approach.  

Marler dismissed the barbs, saying: ‘We want to play at a high tempo and we showed that in the Six Nations when we took France, Ireland and Wales on at that sort of game.

‘I didn’t see them running to any of the scrums or lineouts quicker than us. It’s not a tactic of ours to slow the game down.

‘As a spectator or a neutral you’d probably look at it and (say) it wasn’t a great game to watch because there were a lot of dropped balls and set-pieces. That’s why the game was slow.’

Room for improvement: England can beat New Zealand if they improve their catching, says Joe Marler

Asked if England would have faith in their fitness in a free-flowing contest — as there is likely to be under the roof in Dunedin — he added: ‘Yes, we’ll back our fitness, as long as we’re catching the ball!’

Any attempt by England to add pace to their game would be enhanced by the return at scrum-half of Danny Care, who has recovered from a shoulder injury. As a Quins team-mate Marler is well aware of the 27-year-old’s threat, and he said: ‘He’s that little ball of energy that lifts a game when it has slowed down. He does a quick tap, sparks boys and gets forwards round the corner quick. He brings good tempo.’

Following the first Test, Marler revealed on Twitter that Care — his room-mate — had written him a motivational letter. He admitted yesterday that he didn’t see it until the match was over, but appreciated the gesture nonetheless.

‘I received it after the game,’ he said. ‘I got back to the room and saw this letter on the bed. I said, “DC, what’s this?”. He started laughing and said, “Sorry mate, I didn’t realise you’d left for the game”.

It was very touching. We’re very close and he’s an emotional guy.’

Whether it is by writing letters or dismantling auras, England are finding ways to make a proper contest of this daunting series.
