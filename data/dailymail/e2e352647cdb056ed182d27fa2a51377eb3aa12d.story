Posing proudly in their bridesmaids dresses on one of  the happiest days of their lives, this is the first picture of two sisters who were killed in an horrific crash over Christmas.

Seven-year-old Jessica Portor and her sister Tamzin, ten, were passengers in a Ford Focus driven by their father’s new partner when it crashed into a ditch and rolled into a wooden gate on Thursday evening.

Both youngsters suffered severe head injuries in the  smash on the A47 near King’s Lynn, Norfolk, and were pronounced dead at hospital.

Tragic: Tamzin, 10, and Jessica, seven, with their mother, Lorraine, 31, at her wedding

Their father, Allan Portor, 38, was a 
front-seat passenger and his 43-year-old partner, who was driving the 
black Ford Focus, both suffered minor injuries.

The
girls, who live with their mother Lorraine Mason, 31, in Sutton Bridge,
Lincolnshire, were back-seat passengers with their brother Liam Portor,
12. Liam escaped with minor injuries.

Jessica and Tamzin acted as bridesmaids at their mother’s wedding to her new husband Daniel earlier this year.

Mrs
Mason, who split from Mr Portor around seven years ago, was too upset 
to talk about her loss yesterday, but a friend said: ‘This is just an 
awful tragedy. She was devoted to her girls and she is absolutely 
devastated.’

Police are 
investigating how the car lost control in light rain on  the road at 
Walsoken. There is  no evidence that the driver was speeding or that 
another car  was involved in the incident.

Meanwhile,
the funeral for  two brothers who died when  their car crashed on 
Christmas Day was held yesterday near their home in High Wycombe, 
Buckinghamshire.

Boxing 
champion Amir Khan was among 2,000 mourners who attended the funerals of
Adnan Habib, ten, and Mohammed Arsalaan Habib, four, who were killed 
along with their aunt Bushra Tazarib, 32, on the M6 near Stoke-on-Trent.

The
boys’ mother, Parveen, 38, who was driving, and their sister Misbah, 
17, were also injured in the crash, but have since been discharged from 
hospital.

They had been travelling to a family wedding in Manchester, attended by Mr Khan, who later described his ‘despair’ at the loss.

Relatives
and friends paid their respects at the Castlefield Centre in High 
Wycombe yesterday morning before the bodies were taken to a mosque for 
prayers.

The boys’ family described them as ‘precious jewels’ who spread joy wherever they went.
