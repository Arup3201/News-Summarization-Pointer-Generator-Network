A chief fire officer splashed more than £26,000 of taxpayers' money on business class plane tickets to all corners of the globe.

Lincolnshire County Council's former chief fire officer Mike Thomas took trips to the USA, Canada, Japan and New Zealand to attend international search and rescue training programmes on business class tickets.

He then charged the tickets back to the council at a total cost of £26,768.

The figures, which were obtained by the Taxpayers' Alliance, revealed the council spent more than £42,000 in total on overseas flights for its officers between April 2009 and March this year.

Tony McArdle, council chief executive, admitted mistakes had been made and steps had been taken to address them.

He said: 'Around 75 per cent of these flights were booked by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue.

'The majority were for one individual in his work with groups aiming to improve firefighter safety at an international level.

'Regrettably, one senior fire and rescue officer often travelled at business class, contrary to the council's rules. 

'The individual concerned is no longer employed by the council and we have tightened our procedures to make sure that the rules cannot be disregarded again.

'We will investigate the fire and rescue travelling arrangements and are reminding all of our staff of the need to minimise expenditure as a priority.'

On his travels, Mr Thomas flew to Rhode Island, Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte and South Carolina in the USA, Ottawa in Canada, Berlin in Germany, Panama City in Panama, Tokyo in Japan and Wellington in New Zealand on a mixture of business and economy tickets.

His biggest bill was the flight to Rhode Island, which cost £4,103 for a Club World ticket flying with British Airways.

The biggest bill the council paid however was a £6,004 business class ticket for another employee to fly to the USA.

Mr McArdle said the spending was justified as the worker had to go on a series of flights in a short space of time.

He said: 'This involved internal flights between each site, as well as the flights between the UK and US. 

'As this individual was making five flights within a three-day period, he decided to fly business class on the two between the UK and US. 

'So basically it was because he was spending the best part of three days on planes.' 

Deeping St James Parish Council chairman Phil Dilks said: 'To see this kind of spending on business class tickets at a time when services are being cut is appalling. 'They should hang their heads in shame.'
