Boost: Millions of us reach for a coffee to increase energy levels - but how effective is it?

Millions of us reach for a coffee at least once a day to boost our alertness and counter flagging energy levels.

But what if there was a free alternative that worked even better?

Writer Gregory Ferenstein believes he has the answer - 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise such as push-ups whenever he feels drowsy.

He discovered that the exercises gave him double the energy boost of his daily Starbucks - and saved him a considerable amount of cash in the process.

Writing for The Daily Beast, he explained: 'Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I find a 
quiet corner and perform some form of body-weight exercise that jolts my
 heart up to at last 70 percent of the maximal beats per minute (for me,
 that's about 170).

He said his favourite exercises are 20 burpees (a push-up to 
jumping jack) or 40 mountain climbers (push-up position, bringing knees 
to elbows).

He added: 'I've found that 30 seconds of high-intensity body-weight exercise gives me the same mental boost as a shot of caffeine.'

To try and scientifically prove if that was the case, he applied his findings to a tool that assesses cognitive performance - the website quantified-mind.com.

In his piece, Mr Ferenstein explains how he performed the tests after both 250mg caffeine and exercise, to see how it affected his memory and reaction times.

For reference, a Starbucks Grande Cafe Americano has 225mg of caffeine.

He said: 'Essentially, these types of games test if users are paying attention and if they can think on their feet (i.e. if I've got brain fog).'

He found that his overall cognitive performance increased by six per cent after caffeine - but 12 per cent after exercise.

The only benefit caffeine gave him was when it came to short-term memory, which improved by 26 per cent compared to 16 per cent with exercise. 

A wealth of research backs up his findings. Last year researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute found that high-intensity exercise boosts mental and physical health.

Previously sedentary adults were put through four months of high-intensity interval training.

At the end, their cognitive functions - the ability to think, recall and make quick decisions - had improved significantly, the researchers found.

Last year researchers from the University of South Carolina  found that regular treadmill sessions also give a boost to the cell's powerhouses in the brain.

Research leader Dr Mark Davis said this energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently.
