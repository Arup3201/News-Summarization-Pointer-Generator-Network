In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy transports herself back to Kansas by clicking the heels of her ruby slippers three times.

And while this is clearly fiction, designers have created the next best thing - a device that calls you a taxi simply by hitting your feet together.

Called Dorothy, the system features an accelerometer that can be attached to any shoe and connects to a smartphone app to call a cab automatically.

Dorothy was created by Washington-based iStrategyLabs and is powered by an Arduino micro-controller with a built-in Bluetooth chip, accelerometer, and a cell battery, all inside a clip called Ruby. The Ruby attaches to any shoe (pictured) and connects wirelessly to the Dorothy iPhone app

Dorothy is the brainchild of DJ Saul, managing director at Washington-based iStrategyLabs.

It powered by the LightBlue Bean - an Arduino micro-controller with a built-in Bluetooth chip, inside a clip called Ruby.

This system also features an accelerometer, and a coin cell battery.

The Ruby clips onto any shoe and connects wirelessly to the Dorothy iPhone app.

A ‘trigger’ is activated using three distinct clicks of the heel, but these triggers can be customised.

When the onboard accelerometer detects clicks, it sends a signal to the connected phone via Bluetooth.

When the onboard accelerometer detects clicks, it sends a signal to the connected phone via Bluetooth and the action is automatically taken.

Uber uses the GPS on the user’s phone to know where to send the car.

DJ Saul said Dorothy can also be used to get out of an awkward situation, by faking a phone call discreetly, and it can even be used a security measure to alert people when the wearer is in trouble.

‘While this is our initial prototype, we’re currently exploring models as small as third of its current size, potentially built into an insole,’ explained  DJ Saul.

DJ Saul told MailOnline that the priority is to make the device smaller before discussing a release date or price.

He did add that in the ‘near future’, he’s planning to add extra trigger actions such as ordering a pizza. He is also asking people to suggest triggers via the Dorothy homepage.

The Dorothy gadget was inspired by the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film Wizard of Oz (pictured). In the film, she clicks her heels together three times to magically transport back to Kansas
