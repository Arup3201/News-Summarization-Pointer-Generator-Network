A record-breaking autogyro pilot famous for his work in a James Bond film has died at the age of 97.

Retired Wing Commander Ken Wallis was best known for his action sequence flying in the Little Nellie aircraft as actor Sean Connery’s stunt double in the 1967 film You Only Live Twice.

Mr Wallis, who was honoured with an MBE in 1996, piloted 24 wartime missions over Europe in Wellington bombers, before spending 20 years in weapons research for the Royal Air Force.

The great-grandfather, who lived near Dereham, Norfolk, was honoured in October by the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators for his lifetime contribution to aerospace.

He was also a keen photographer and over the years helped police in aerial reconnaissance, the search for London murderer Lord Lucan and even the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland.

Mr Wallis was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in 1916 in the middle of the First World War - and trips to air shows sparked his interest in flying.

Although he had poor sight in one eye he managed to gain his private pilot’s licence in 1937 without an eye test and he made his first solo flight in a de Havilland Gipsy Moth.

He was based at RAF Uxbridge in West London during the Second World War and flew Westland Lysanders after cheating in an eye test.

'It was hard work but fun when it was finished. The funny thing is I don’t even get a mention in the credits'

Mr Wallis spent the next 20 years working in armament and weapon research, but after leaving the RAF in 1964 it was autogyros which became his passion.

He started flying them in 1959 and was the first instructor and examiner for the flying machine.

Between 1968 and 2002 he set 34 world records, including the 3km (1.9-mile) speed record for autogyros, which he set at 207.7kph (129.1mph).

In 1975 he broke the record for the longest flight in an autogyro when he flew the length of Britain.

He was asked to pilot the autogyro in 
Bond film You Only Live Twice, which was filmed in Japan in 1967. He had
never seen a Bond movie and he only met Connery once during the 
filming.

Last year he said: ‘Sean Connery had 
to sit in the autogyro and put on the helmet, but then he had to get out
and it was me who did the first take-off.

‘I had to do 81 flights and was in 
the air for more than 44 hours. It was hard work but fun when it was 
finished. The funny thing is I don’t even get a mention in the credits.’

Mr Wallis later used the autogyro, which can hover without the pilot touching the controls, to help scan the Sussex Downs for Lord Lucan and in a 1970 search for the Loch Ness monster.

Lord Lucan vanished after his family's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was found dead at the home of his estranged wife in London's Belgravia in 1974 after being bludgeoned with a lead pipe.

Farewell: Mr Wallis died early on Sunday and a private funeral will take place at a date to be arranged

Mr Wallis kept a fleet of 20 autogyros, including a replica of Little Nellie, in a mini hangar at his home in Norfolk and last year he was still flying every other day.

He said in 2012: ‘They are one of the safest machines to fly because if the engine stops the rotors keep turning, so it can be landed.

‘Unlike other aircraft it can fly in all sorts of conditions, even stormy weather. I used to fly to work every day on the south coast, now I tend to fly more locally.’

Mr Wallis was also an inventor and designed the world’s first electric slot-car race track, pre-dating the earliest Scalextric by 15 years.

He was made an MBE in 1996, and this summer finally received his Bomber Command medal for his time in the 103 Squadron based at RAF Elsham Wolds in Lincolnshire 71 years ago.

He died in the early hours of Sunday and a private funeral will take place at a date to be arranged.
