A fisherman who was bitten by an alligator and found his right arm trapped in its jaws made an impressive escape by shoving his hand even further into the beast's mouth.

Vincent Dewan, 21, was fishing in the Indian River by Port St John, Florida, when the 10ft animal launched itself out of the waist-height water and clamped down on his arm.

The gator started to wrench his arm back and forth, but Dewan avoided major damage by not resisting and moving his arm with the thrashing beast after it struck Saturday.

Instead, he thrust his arm deeper into it's mouth in the hope of loosening his grip, according to WFTV.

Dewan was catching mullet in the water and putting them in his pocket to use as bait to get bigger fish when he was attacked - and believed that's why the gator attacked him.

He told the station: 'I don't think he was actually trying to bite me, I was putting a mullet into my pocket that I'd just caught, and just as I did that he bit the hand I was putting the mullet in with.'

'When he grabbed my hand I just moved my hand with how he was thrashing.' Dewan then described how he made the split-second decision to thrust his arm further in, after which 'he let go and swam away'.

The alligator was later captured by trappers on Sunday. The beast is 10ft 6in long, and has lost half of its tail.

The attack broke some bones in Dewan's hand, and tore a gash in his palm. He also suffered puncutre wounds on top of his hand

He is currently being treated at Wuesthoff Medical Center in Rockledge, and is expected to make a full recovery.
