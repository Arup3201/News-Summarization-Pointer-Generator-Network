Their cheerful chirrups have been waking Radio 4 listeners up every morning on the broadcaster's Tweet of the Day programme.

The early morning segment was designed to educate listeners about British bird species, with the and compiled from an official list of 600 birds compiled by the British Ornithologists Union (BOU).

But Radio 4 has incurred the wrath of animal lovers, who have pointed out that some of the melodious birds who appear on the programme do not belong to British species.

It bills itself as a 'series feature songs or calls which you are likely to hear each month, but also offers a fascinating insight into the behaviour or habits of the bird, their literary or folklore associations, stories of science or conservation success'.

But one listener penned a letter to the Radio Times, complaining about the amount of 'passing migrant' species that are featured, and said that most listeners would not be familiar with it, the Daily Telegraph reported.

However, Paul Stancliffe, from the 
British Trust Ornithology, said that the selection has represented a 
good mix of species that appear in Britain, however briefly.

Veteran
 wildlife expert David Attenborough is among a number of presenters who 
have hosted the series which will feature a 90-second recording of a 
different bird each day.

Since
 May 6th, it will run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied 
by a short narration related to the different species, including the 
Cuckoo, Nightingale, Tawny Owl and Storm Petrel.

The
 series, which is being made by the BBC's Natural History Unit, 
broadcasts every weekday morning at 05.58am, just before the flagship 
current affairs show, the Today programme.

One of the episodes will be repeated on Sunday mornings at 08.58am.

Attenborough
 presented every episode of the series in May, while other wildlife 
presenters including Steve Backshall, Miranda Krestovnikov and Chris 
Packham will then take over the role.

A Tawny Owl, which emits a 'strange wheeze' is one of the British birds that have appeared on the show
