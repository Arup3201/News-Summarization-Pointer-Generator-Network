The United States has plummeted 13 places on a global index of 'personal freedom' since President Barack Obama's second year in office, according to a London-based think tank, landing behind 20 other countries.

The Legatum Prosperity Index surveys people worldwide on their perceptions of a wide range of factors including health and education. The U.S. placed first globally in the health category, but Americans' view of how their personal liberties are treated put the nation in 21st place.

Four years ago, America ranked ninth in that category, based on polling conducted during 2009 – President Barack Obama's first year in office.

Residents of France, Costa Rica and the UK now believe they enjoy greater freedom than what Americans perceive they have themselves.

CONFIDENCE KILLER? Edward Snowden's revelation of a massive electronic surveillance program in the U.S. may be one reason Americans are discouraged about their levels of personal freedom 

BIG BROTHER OBAMA? Washington, D.C. protesters insisted in January that the U.S. government's surveillance programs have gone too far

Gallup ran the polling for Legatum, asking Americans how satisfied they are with how the United States handles civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants, according to the Washington Examiner.

'This is not a good report for Obama,” Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the newspaper.

The organization found that since 2009 Americans' approval of how the U.S. helps secure their civil liberties and protects their freedom of choice has declined by 22 per cent. 

The 2014 Legatum Prosperity Index puts the United States below France and other Western European nations in terms of how its citizens believe their government supports individual freedoms. 

 

Since the person freedom category encompasses everything from people's opinions about their physical safety to their freedom of speech and information security, it's difficult to attribute the loss of confidence to any single event or trend.

But the Obama years have seen growing concerns about the growth of government surveillance by the National Security Agency and other government offices, first exposed by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

The advent of the Affordable Care Act, too, has eroded certain freedoms, mandating for the first time that Americans buy a product – medical insurance – or face a penalty.
