Victim: Kalyn Pennygraph, then 3, was riding the Techno Jump at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo last March when she slipped from under a restraint and fell off the ride

A Texas family has received an almost $80,000 pay out after their young daughter was thrown up to 8 feet off a carnival ride and suffered concussion.

Kalyn Pennygraph, then 3, was riding the Techno Jump at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo last March when she slipped from under a restraint and fell off the ride. The dramatic accident was caught on tape.

Her mother, Shaniea Pennygraph, sued the carnival operator, Ray Cammack Shows, in November seeking compensation for medical care, physical pain and mental anguish as well as current and probable future physical impairment, and the case was settled on Monday.

According to the Chron.com, Kalyn 
will receive payments worth at least $50,000 to help during her college 
years and another $27,500 to cover medical expenses and attorneys' fees.

John Neese, the Pennygraph family's lawyer, told Chron.com that Kaylyn was 'doing fine' almost a year after the accident.

According to an injury report, the 
girl boarded the ride with her brother while her mother was supervising 
on the sidelines and suffered a concussion and head abrasions from the 
fall.

The incident has forced stricter fairground ride requirements for children.

Kalyn was reportedly tall enough to 
ride on the Techno Jump under earlier rules.

Fall: The child is seen coming coming loose from the car, about 25 seconds into the ride

Coming loose: Earlier in the ride, the child is seen sliding down in her seat before the contraption's 'bouncing' mechanism is activated

For the reminder of the 
March 2012 carnival children too short to ride alone had to be 
accompanied by an adult aged 16 or over.

The new rules will kick in for this year's show, according to Chron.com.

The shocking video of Kalyn's tumble 
emerged just days after the three-year-old girl was hurled from the 
fairground ride after she slipped under the restraining bar.

The child is shown in the video with her feet in the air seconds before flying off the Techno Jump carnival ride.

The child suffered concussion and 
bruising to her face and head after she was thrown from the moving 
contraption between six and eight feet above the ground.

The incident was caught on camera by 
chance as a reveler filmed other thrill-seekers on the ride, which is 
why the girl's fall is only partially visible from the edge of the 
frame.

Rodeo Chief Operating Officer Leroy Shafer said at the time: 'Itâ€™s a very scary-looking piece of 
video. We are just thankful that this young lady was not more injured.

'It boils down to a three-year-old not knowing what to do and 
was probably scared to death.'

In
an initial account of the incident, the rodeo organizers had claimed 
that Kalyn got on the ride with her mother and brother.

However, after deciding the ride was too small for an adult, the mother left the young girl with her brother, it was claimed.

Officials then said the girl tried to 
climb out of the car to get back to her mother about 15 seconds into the
ride but fell out and landed on a metal platform.

Shafer revised the rodeo's account 
after viewing the video,
adding: 'We now know more definitely at what point she came out.'

The three-seat cars in the Techno Jump ride all come with separate lap belts and a restraining bar, which is lowered over all riders.

It is unclear whether the three-year-old was able to comply with the ride instructions, which require all passengers to sit up, hold the lap bar and place their feet on the floor.

Investigators do not yet know whether she slipped under both restraints or if she managed to free herself from the belt before flying from the car.
