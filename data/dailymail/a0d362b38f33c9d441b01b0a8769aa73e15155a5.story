The last six years of Katie Piper's life have been a triumph of strength by anyone's standards - in 2008, the former model suffered terrible burns after her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Lynch arranged to have sulfuric acid thrown in her face.

Katie's injuries were so severe that she was expected to die and she was left with permanent scarring, but instead of letting the incident defeat her, she turned the experience into a positive by becoming a role model for women who have experienced domestic violence.

She is now a successful writer and TV presenter and a regular at premieres and awards ceremonies. 

Katie's personal life is equally fruitful - in March last year, she gave birth to her first child Belle Elizabeth and last month her boyfriend James, who she met in 2013, proposed.

What a beauty: Katie Piper cradles her daughter Belle in this Instagram picture, she has revealed how she hopes that the 10 month old will walk down the aisle when she weds her carpenter boyfriend James

In a touching new interview Katie Piper has revealed that she hopes her ten month old daughter Belle will walk down the aisle with her when she finally weds her carpenter fiancé. 

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Katie said: 'We’ve been watching her trying to stand up and walk and saying it would be great if she could walk down the aisle with us. 

'Plus I think it will be nice for Belle that we'll all have the same surname as a family. I can't wait for it all to be official.' 

The couple became engaged on December 5 and the 31-year-old has now spoken of her joy that they with soon be a proper family unit.

Despite getting engaged just four weeks ago, Katie and James have already begun planning their nuptials - they brought a stack of wedding magazines on holiday to Mauritius over the festive period and spent their days flicking through the brochures while lying on the beach.  

The couple had traveled to the island following a family Christmas with 29 members of her and James' family.

But while the star is keen to have her daughter feature heavily in her wedding, she has decided against ever featuring Belle in any of her television work.

Katie admits that she is still extremely affected by the 2008 attack and is wary of being approached by fans on the street. 

The experience has also made her reluctant about exposing her child to the spotlight. 

She said: 'I'm famous in the first instance for being attacked. 

'After she was born people did tweet me horrible things like 'she is as ugly as her mum' and I don't want her to have that when she goes to school.'

Although her television fame means she is now a regular at red carpet events, the 31-year-old revealed that she can feel 'intimidated' by the cameras

Katie, who runs her own charity The Katie Piper Foundation and found fame with her TV show Bodyshockers, also revealed that she can still feel worried and anxious about her looks. 

Although her television fame means she is now a regular at red carpet events, the 31-year-old revealed that she can feel 'intimidated' by the cameras and especially struggled with the extra weight that she carried after giving birth to Belle.

Katie said: 'After giving birth I did feel quite shallow because there were moments when we were going out and I would say to my boyfriend ‘I don’t look nice in anything’ and I haven’t got the excuse because I am not pregnant.'

The star went on to say that whilst she did not suffer from post natal depression she did have days where she felt down and questioned whether she would be a good mother because of her busy work schedule.

Katie first announced her engagement on Twitter on December 6. 

She said at the time: 'So excited to tell you all..... I became someone's fiancé last night! I'm engaged to be married :)'. 

The TV presenter has previously revealed how she and James met in 2013 after being set up by a friend, Juliet, who gave him her number.

She has previously described their first phone call as 'nervous and stilted' but said she soon started to relax and spent a lot of time telling each other about their jobs.

The pair then arranged to meet up for a drink and a trip to the cinema. 

She said of the event: 'I figured that if he did turn out to be a starer, at least going to the cinema would keep his eyes elsewhere. 

'James was chatty, witty and looked me squarely in the eye. He never once mentioned my burns, and because he didn’t, I didn’t either.

'He didn’t even stare at them, so I didn’t feel self-conscious. He had me relaxed and buzzing with confidence.'
