Megan Mennes posted a picture of her son Quinn on Instagram after he was recovering from an illness

A mother has been praised for her inspirational open letter to an internet troll who branded her son, who has down syndrome, 'ugly'.

Megan Mennes, from Houston, Texas, posted a picture of her son Quinn on Instagram after he was recovering from an illness. 

The photograph showed him playing happily in the garden with the caption: 'It's been a long week of illness for this one but it looks like he's finally on the mend.'

However, she did not expect a cruel response from an internet troll. 

The person left a one-word comment underneath the photo which read 'ugly'. 

However, the proud mother was quick to respond and posted an open letter to the person who made the offensive comment. 

She wrote on her blog site: 'I don't want to make assumptions about you, but I can guess from your immaturity and ignorance that you know little about the helplessness that parents feel when caring for a sick infant with respiratory issues.

'Quinn was sick last week, but was feeling much better by Friday.

'We decided to sit in the backyard and soak up the sun after school. 

'There aren't many things in this world more beautiful than seeing your recently-ill child light up in a smile, and I snapped a few photos to celebrate his recovery, then posted them on Instagram with the hashtag â€œ#downsyndrome.

'The fact that you find my child ugly is one thing.

'You are entitled to your opinion. But the fact that you intentionally search #downsyndrome to find pictures to insult (sadly, Quinn is not the only victim of your behavior; I came across many other inflammatory responses) is both childish and sad.

Backlash: People were quick to respond to the troll who posted the word 'ugly' under the photo

'What about purposefully seeking out pictures of our children? What about the fact that a beautiful photograph of my son was tarnished by your hatred?

'That's not a joke. That's cyber bullying. Needless to say, I reported your profile.

'This will not be the last time someone discounts my son because he is different.

'It will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense, but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel. It's inhuman.

'I simply hope my own children learn to look past ignorant comments and actions and treat others with respect and dignity. We all deserve it, even you.'

Ms Mennes searched the troll's site and what she found disgusted her.

She wrote: 'Your profile is also full of offensive posts and crude statements, all of which point to your own illiteracy.

'You claim it was a joke and that people should lighten up. But what about purposefully seeking out pictures of our children?'

Ms Mennes signed off her blog post with the words 'A Proud Mama'.

The letter has gone viral and there has been global support for the English teacher who has two children.

This
 week she wrote: 'I can't even begin to express my gratitude; I wish I 
had time to respond to all your messages personally, but due to the 
overwhelming influx of support, this is simply impossible.

'So
 instead, please accept this post as one giant group hug. You all make 
this world better with your positive outlooks and selfless willingness 
to reach out to our family. THANK YOU!'
