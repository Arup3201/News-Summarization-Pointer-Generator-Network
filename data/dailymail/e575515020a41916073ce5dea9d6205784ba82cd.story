Nat King Cole's family can never forget what it's like to be targeted by racists. Someone wrote the N-word in fire in the garden of their home, their dog was poisoned and there was a concerted campaign to get them out. And this wasn't in the racial cauldron of America's Deep South, but in the very liberal state of California.

Nat King Cole was born into a deeply segregated society in Alabama, yet thanks to his huge talent he rose to prominence, overcoming hatred and bigotry from white supremacists. It is nearly 50 years since Nat died of lung cancer aged just 45, but today his three daughters are here to retell their story and introduce a  new generation to their father's courage – and music.

Natalie, who followed her father into singing, says she hopes to bring home to people the truly shocking extent of the prejudice they – and all black people – had to face. 

Natalie wants to retell their story and introduce a  new generation to her father's courage and music.

'My parents tried to shield us from a lot of what was going on, but I remember one night when some people were letting off firecrackers in the rose bushes,' says Natalie, when I meet her and her younger sisters, twins Casey and Timolin in London. 'My mum went outside with a rolled-up newspaper to threaten them.

'And when my father was headlining in cabaret at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas we weren't allowed a room there because of our colour. We all had to stay at a little motel, including Dad. Back home, our Boxer dog Mr Cole died after eating poisoned meat that had been thrown over the fence. My father was devastated. He loved that dog.'

Nat Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1919 but his pastor father moved the family to Chicago when he was four to give them a better life than in the colour-segregated Southern states, which were dominated by the viciously racist Ku Klux Klan.

He showed a prodigious talent for music from a young age and was soon regarded as one of the nation's best jazz pianists – he was nicknamed 'King' Cole because of the old nursery rhyme and it stuck. He first had success with the King Cole Trio but it was when he started singing that the group really began to do well.

The hits kept coming: The Christmas Song, Unforgettable, Mona Lisa, Too Young are all still loved around the world. Nat would have been happy concentrating on his music but doing so as an equal to Frank Sinatra – his great friend and chart rival – was impossible.

Even when, like Frank, Nat was performing in the big hotels, not only was he not allowed to stay there but he couldn't use the pool or even cross the casino floor. For many years he kept his head down; didn't complain and played to segregated or whites-only audiences.

He even agreed to wear make-up to lighten up his skin for TV appearances so as not to offend white viewers. But still he was attacked.

In 1948 he married his second wife Maria Ellington, the mother of Natalie, Casey and Timolin as well as  two children they adopted. When they bought their first house together in smart Hancock Park, Los Angeles, they were the first black family in the neighbourhood and many tried to hound them out.

As well as the fire and the dog poisoning, the girls were rejected by the local school. All the neighbours had Nat's albums but no one wanted him living next door. A committee of property owners complained to him, 'We don't want any undesirables moving in.' He retorted, 'Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I'll be the first to complain.'

'Our father was a reluctant star, he loved what he did but didn't anticipate the success or the 
issues. He wasn't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into 
something bigger than he was'

I ask his daughters why he stayed. Says Timolin, 'It was our mother. She wanted to raise the bar. That was the house she wanted and no one was going to push her out. She was also very light-skinned, which was a great advantage. She'd never really experienced racism before that.'

Adds Natalie with a laugh, 'She never let anyone tell her what to do. She was a sophisticated lady who'd been to finishing school in Boston and as far as she was concerned she had more class and breeding than any of the people trying to push her out. She was a riot.'

Nat was to
 remain a reluctant figurehead of the civil rights movement when in 1956
 he became the first black host of a nationally syndicated TV show; the 
Nat King Cole Show. From the start the show struggled to attract 
sponsors so friends including Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Tony 
Bennett and Eartha Kitt agreed to appear for free.

But
 white viewers in the South, outraged at seeing a black man hosting a TV
 show, pressured the sponsors and advertisers to drop their funding of 
it. They did.

After
 just a year Nat was forced to pull the plug saying 'Madison Avenue (the
 New York headquarters of the big advertising agencies) is afraid of the
 dark.' A recent TV documentary about his life – which included telling 
anecdotes from Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett and Bruce Forsyth, who 
regarded Nat as his hero – had this story at its heart.

'Our father was a reluctant star,' says Natalie. 'He loved what he did but didn't anticipate the success or the issues. He wasn't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into something bigger than he was. A lot of white folks couldn't get their brain around a black guy having his own show. They resented the fact that he was gifted and talented – but black.

'He paved the way for Oprah and Bill Cosby and all the young stars of today. But there was a lot of psychological stress and hardship. When he lost the show I think it made him sick. He hardly ever said a mean word or got angry. I think that's why he got ulcers.'

He was also coming under pressure from the black community to stand up to segregation. 'They were outraged when he continued to perform in front of segregated audiences saying, 'I can't change the situation in a day.' Though he'd given money to groups campaigning in the South against segregation he was called an Uncle Tom, a traitor to his colour.

'Our father was a gentle giant,' says Casey. 'He spoke through his music and he was often criticised for that. You have to pick your battles. Today everyone would be sucking up to him but it was a different world. He had to suck up to them.'

'He paved the way for Oprah and Bill Cosby and all the young stars of today.'

Natalie, the only one of Nat's children to follow him into a singing career – Ivy League educated Casey and Timolin both went into PR and now run a charity in their father's name – can empathise from her own experiences. 'When I was just starting out in the 1970s I was in Alabama with a group of people,' she recalls.

'We went to a restaurant and they refused to serve us. We were shocked; this was the 1970s. A sheriff came but only to tell us to move on. We were devastated.'

Nat's life was cut short cruelly early. A heavy smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in December 1964 and died two months later. Natalie, now 64, looks at her feet as she thinks about how, as a vulnerable 15-year-old, she numbed the pain of her beloved father's death with drugs.

'Losing Dad set me into a whole whirling dervish of stuff,' she says sadly. 'Smoking was one of the things I did – my mother went mad, she said, "You couldn't have loved your father if you're smoking". But I only stopped seven or eight years ago.'

For Casey and Timolin, who are 11 years younger, it's hard to know what are memories of their father, and what are things they have been told. 'It's sad to think we didn't get to know him,' says Timolin. 'It's bittersweet because we've learned about who our father is through photographs and his music.'

All three think it's important to keep their father's legacy going. 'Dad was one of a kind,' says Natalie with a smile. 'There will never be another Nat King Cole. They weren't expecting it when he showed up. He was such a classy lovely man, coming out of the South fairly uneducated, with this gift. He captivated the world with his voice.'

Nat King Cole's The Extraordinary album is out now on Universal.
