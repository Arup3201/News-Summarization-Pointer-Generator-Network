Nottingham Forest picked up a pre-season win against Premier League outfit West Brom on Stuart Pearce's return to the club thanks to a goal by Matty Fryatt.

Pearce, who played for Nottingham Forest during his playing days and took temporary charge of the club during the 1996-97 season, took his place in the home dugout for the first time since taking up the reins at The City Ground.

And the 52-year-old received an extremely warm reception from supporters of his new side before the match.

Match winner: Matty Fryatt scored the opening goal for Forest after 25 minutes

The first notable incident of the first 
half came after just seven minutes when Premier League referee Andre 
Marriner was forced off after picking up an injury.

Fryatt grabbed the only goal of the game 18 minutes later when the striker, who was played in by team-mate Chris Burke, was allowed to slot home past England international Ben Foster.

Victor Anichebe came close to getting himself on the scoresheet however his headed effort was cleared off the line.

Alan Irvine's side were unable to find an equaliser in their penultimate friendly before they take on Sunderland during the opening weekend of the Premier League.

Forest, on the other hand, will go into their Championship fixture against Blackpool in high spirits after picking up a win against Premier League opposition.
