A man who claims his tent, car and dog were snatched by aliens on a camping trip in Cardiff has spoken out about his harrowing experience.

Keith Robins, 37, said that he looked on 'gobsmacked' as a fleet of 12 to 15 spacecrafts homed into view one evening in 1992 while on a camping trip with friends Christopher French and Sylvan Salway.

Keith and his friends had asked permission from their parents to go on the trip, but the group were left disappointed when before they even had a chance to pitch their tent, they claim the alien vessels made off with the Datsun Cherry and its contents.

Believer: Keith Robins says he is willing to take a lie detector test over his claims that aliens stole his car

Mr Robins from Rumney, Cardiff explained that they had parked up the car in Whitchurch and went looking for somewhere to pitch their tent.

It was then that the locked car disappeared without the engine starting - with Keith’s tent and Chris’ eight-week-old pit bull Staffordshire terrier still inside.

He said: 'It all happened so fast in about three to five minutes. I walked back to the car and it had just vanished off the face of the earth'

Determined: Keith has written to the Ministry of Defence about the abduction of his Datsun Cherry by aliens back in 1992

It was then that all three noticed a bright glow above the trees for just under a minute.

For 'defence purposes' the MoD offered a UFO hotline for more than 50 years, investigating sightings from all around the UK.

Its archives show one man 'made weapon to shoot down alien spaceships' and that UFOs were reported over as hovering over landmarks such as Stonehenge and the Houses of Parliament. One letter from a child in Cheshire demanded a reply to whether there was life 'outside our planet...I have the right to know'.

There was an alarming surge in sightings after the service closed down in 2009, with more than 600 alien experiences were reported to the hotline that year. However, the eerie orange lights that many people saw in the skies were most likely to be Chinese lanterns, which were fashionable for weddings and parties.

'These lights came from behind these massive trees. About 12 to 15 of them. I thought they were pink flamingos. My other mates thought they were fire flies,' he said.

'They then just speeded up and were gone in 30 seconds. I was baffled - so confused.'

The next day, Keith and his friends reported the incident to the police, leaving out the mysterious floating objects, but a search for the Datsun Cherry and its contents proved futile.

Keen to find out what he saw, Keith sent a handwritten letter and diagram showing the alien space crafts to the Ministry of Defence in October 1992.

To this day he still says: 'I don’t 
100 per cent know what happened but I’m going to believe it for the rest
of my life. I’m willing to have a lie detector test,' he said.

Mr
Robins’ story was just one of many extraterrestrial tales revealed to 
the public when the Ministry of Defence released its final cache of UFO 
documents.

The 25 files
contained 4,400 pages of reports received between 2007 and 2009 with 
details of alien abductions, air chases between police and UFOs and 
spaceship wreckages.

The MoD’s UFO desk, which handled these reports, saw the number of UFO sightings rocket, with 600 reported in 2009 alone.

Buckling under the weight of these submissions, the project was recently shut down, but Nick Pope, who worked for the UFO project from 1991 to 1994 said believers should not be laughed off too quickly.

'The believers only have to be proved right once,' he said.
