A year after losing her sister to cystic fibrosis, a 17-year-old girl has received a life-changing vest to combat the same condition thanks to the generosity of people in a Queensland town.

Cystic fibrosis makes breathing difficult for Bundaberg's Sabrina Zwarts as a sticky mucus develops in her lungs and the best way to improve her quality of life was to get a $20,000 vest that needed to be imported from the United States.

The percussion vest means Sabrina's lung capacity will go from 55 per cent up to 90 per cent, along with physiotherapy and other treatments.

To help pay for the vest, Sabrina and her family kick started a campaign to raise the money.

But four months into fundraising efforts, the Zwartses hit a snag and donations dried up, just $7,000 away from their goal.

Cystic fibrosis sufferer Sabrina Zwarts, 17, has received a $20,000 vest that will help improve her quality of life

This is when Bundaberg's Friendly Society Private Hospital stepped in and helped make up the rest of the funds.

Without the vest, Sabrina's father, Vincent, said his daughter could visit the hospital up to six times a year, staying about two to three weeks at a time.

'It depends on her environment. If she was exposed to the cold or something like that then she would go more when they couldn’t treat her with antibiotics,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Both Vincent and Sabrina said they were grateful for all the support they had received.

'It shows that no matter where you live you have a good community behind you and when you ask for support they’ll support you,' Sabrina said.

'Receiving the vest, at the end day, I’ll live a longer and healthier life and get the mucus off my chest.'

This glimmer of hope comes after the one-year anniversary of the death of Sabrina's sister, Jessica, who lost her battle with cystic fibrosis in May last year at just 18 years old.

Both siblings were diagnosed at birth - Jessica in 1994 and Sabrina in 1997.

Their father, Vincent, said they were heartbreaking blows to the family.

'When [the hospital] told us about Jess...they didn’t know what to say to us,' he said.

'We hadn’t heard of it before.

'To make a long story short, they told us to enjoy her while we still could because she was not going to have a long life.

'Most kids back then would not see their teenage years.'

And with Sabrina, it did not get any easier.

'We were devastated about Sabrina because we saw what Jessica had to go through. There were no words for it,' Mr Zwarts said.

'We decided we didn’t want to have any kids because of that reason.'

But due to technological advances, pregnant women were able to be tested to see if their babies would have cystic fibrosis.

So the Zwarts had two more kids, 10-year-old Isabela and 11-year-old Vincent Junior - who are carriers of the illness' gene but do not have the condition.

But even if they did have cystic fibrosis, Mr Zwarts said they would still have had Isabella and Vincent because he and his second wife did not believe in abortion.

The Zwarts family - Vincent Junior, 11, Sabrina, 17, Vincent Senior and Isabela, 10 - have turned their experiences with cystic fibrosis into something positive

While most families would find it hard to stay positive through such tough times, the Zwarts have used their experiences to raise awareness about the illness.

'Sabrina and myself feel very strongly about raising awareness of cystic fibrosis and educating people about this horrible illness as there is still no cure,' Mr Zwarts said.

'I lost my daughter Jessica to cystic fibrosis last year...and I'm not going to lose another daughter.

'I'm so lucky Sabrina has a very positive outlook on life and is very compliant with her treatment.'

Mr Zwarts said he wanted to raise more awareness because there needed to be more government support for families who were dealing with the devastating illness.

'It wasn’t easy in the first six months when Jessica passed away and we used that to further our determination,' he said.

'There’s a lot of treatment and medication overseas and those with it overseas have a longer life span than those with it in Australia.

'With treatments like the vest we have it’s non-existent [in Australia] unless people do what we did by fundraising or buying it from the US directly, but the government doesn’t help at all.'

The illness means Sabrina has trouble breathing because a sticky mucus develops in her lungs

Mr Zwarts said he was also lobbying Health Minister Peter Dutton to put a medication that would improve the lifestyle of cystic fibrosis sufferers on the Pharmaceutical Benefits System.

'Kalydeco is available overseas in the US and the UK, and it’s a tablet that improves lung function and improves weight gain,' he said.

'To buy it privately it costs $300,000 a year in Australia.

'Kids are dying because we don’t have this medication [readily available] in Australia.'

But the most important thing to Sabrina about raising awareness of the disease is making sure no one living with cystic fibrosis feels isolated.

'We want everyone that has cystic fibrosis to know you're not alone, and to keep up with your treatments and your medications because if you don’t you won’t have a longer or healthier life,' she said.
