Chelsea striker Fernando Torres is closing in on a return to Atletico Madrid, according to the Spanish club's assistant coach German Burgos.

Torres, 30, joined AC Milan on a two-year loan deal in August but the Spain forward yet to rediscover his best form, scoring just once in 10 Serie A appearances.

'It (the Torres deal) is on the verge of completion and we are waiting for things to firm up,' Burgos was quoted as saying in the Spanish media.

'He will be a very important reinforcement for the second half of the season.

'We will get the best out of him, the same as everyone, and he knows where he is coming to.'

Atletico’s Italy winger Alessio Cerci will move to Milan on loan as part of the deal, which will run until the end of the 2015-16 season.

Cerci said on his Facebook page on Saturday that he had not yet signed with another club.

ATLETICO MADRID (2000-2007)

244 appearances, 91 goals

LIVERPOOL (2007-2011)

142 appearances, 81 goals

CHELSEA (2010-2014)

172 appearances, 45 goals

AC MILAN (2014)

10 appearances, one goal

'I am an Atletico Madrid player and together with the club I am considering the best solution for both,' he added. 'I think that is right and normal.'

A World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain, Torres joined Atletico at the age of 11.

Known as 'El Nino' (The Kid), he made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2001 when Madrid’s second club were in the Spanish second division. 

When he left for Liverpool in July 2007 he pledged to return and is hoping a second stint at Atletico will help resurrect a career that has largely been a disappointment since he joined Chelsea for £50m in January 2011.

Atletico’s next match is a La Liga game at home to Levante on January 3 before they host Real Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie on January 7.

Torres was unable to reproduce his scoring form from Atletico or Liverpool after joining Chelsea for £50m
