New popularity: The Pill has overtaken the condom as the go-to contraceptive for under-age teenagers

Girls under the legal age of consent are more likely to choose The Pill over the condom as their preferred method of contraception, new figures show.

The research suggested 70,000 girls aged 15 and under attended NHS community contraceptive clinics between 2011 and 2012.

Forty one per cent of 15-year-olds who 
attended clinics opted for the Pill, while 36 per 
cent asked for the male condom.

This was a turnaround on the previous year when the figures were reversed.

The research by the Health and Social 
Care Information Centre (HSCIC) also revealed the clinics were used by eight per cent of teenage girls aged 13 to 15 and just under a quarter of 16-to-19-year-old women in England.

The HSCIC said that oral contraception has been the most common method of contraception for all the older age groups for many years but it is the first time that the pill has become the most popular form of contraception for 15-year-olds.

HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'The report captures the changing way in which women across the age range are managing their reproductive health.

'While the oral contraceptive pill is clearly the most popular form of contraception among older women, this report indicates that now, for the first time, it has become the preferred form of contraception among 15-year-old girls too - overtaking the male condom.

'Together with the continuing rise of the long-acting reversible contraceptive, this captures just two of the ways in which people’s choice of contraception is changing.'

Rebecca Findlay from the Family Planning Association, said: 'The pill is still a popular method of contraception, it’s easy to use, easy to get hold of and very reliable so it’s not surprising that younger women want to use it.

'It’s important that women whatever their age are offered a choice of the 15 methods so they find the right one for them and also that they remember to use condoms to protect against Sexually Transmitted Infections.'
