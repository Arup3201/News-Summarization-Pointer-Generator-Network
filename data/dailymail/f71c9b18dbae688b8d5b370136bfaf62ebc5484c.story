A frank admission today by New South Wales MP Dr Andrew Cornwell at the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) hearing into Liberal Party fundraising, admitting that developer Hilton Grugeon's $10,000 purchase of a painting from his wife was a 'sham' and that the money was used to pay his payroll tax.

Dr Cornwell, who was given the Rex Newell painting of a farmhouse by his parents, gave the art work to Mr Grugeon, who told him soon after that he wanted to pay for it.

Mr Grugeon was put in contact with Dr Cornwell's wife, Samantha Brooks, who later invoiced the developer for $10,120 for the painting.

Counsel assisting Geoffrey Watson asked him if he smelled a rat when the payment was made.

Dr Cornwell said: 'I did'.

When he showed the Charlestown MP the invoice, Mr Watson added that it was clearly a sham.

'I think so,' Dr Cornwell replied.

The focus at Independent Commission Against Corruption today in Sydney 
has been on two $10,000 transactions involving Charlestown MP Dr Andrew Cornwell and property developers

He went on to say that the developer, Mr Grugeon, was definitely trying to curry favour.

In response to this, Dr Cornwell replied: 'If the proposition is that I obtained financial benefit from that, the answer is clearly yes.'

In another incident, Dr Cornwell, said he 'just froze' when developer and Newcastle Mayor Jeff McCloy handed him a brown envelope with $10,000 in cash in late 2010.

He said Councillor McCloy made no demands when he handed him the money while the pair sat in the mayor's luxury Bentley in the lead-up to the 2011 state election.

'He said: 'I should be giving this to the Salvation Army',' Dr Cornwell said.

'That was the extent of the conversation.'

Dr Andrew Cornwell arrives at the Independent Commission Against Corruption in Sydney to give evidence. The Charlestown MP is the latest politician to be forced to quit the Liberal Party as a result of the ongoing inquiry into election fundraising

During his opening address, Counsel Assisting Geoffrey Watson, had remarked that Dr Cornwell's acceptance of the $10,000 in a brown paper bag was just 'the result of inexperience'.

He withdrew those remarks today, suggesting new evidence had come to light.

Counsel Assisting, Geoffrey Watson, told the ICAC hearing in Sydney today that new evidence has come to light regarding the actions of Dr Cornwell and Mr Owen

Dr Cornwell and fellow MP Tim Owen quit the Liberal Party yesterday after allegations against both were aired at the ICAC inquiry.

Mr Owen, the Member for Newcastle, was also forced to relinquish his Liberal Party status and move to the 
cross-benches after it was alleged members of his campaign team were 
funded by property developers.

Political donations by property developers have been banned in NSW since 2009.

Operation Spicer is ICAC's investigation into allegations that NSW Liberal Party figures tried to circumvent fund-raising bans in the lead-up to the 2011 NSW election.

Newcastle Mayor Jeff McCloy is due to give evidence next week amid calls from fellow councillors for him to step aside from mayoral duties during the ICAC proceedings.
