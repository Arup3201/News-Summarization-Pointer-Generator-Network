Joe Root has a knack for niggle when it comes to Sri Lanka but is focusing only on upsetting the odds when it comes to England’s one-day future.

A combination of five defeats in six limited-overs series, injuries to key men and the fact that not a single Englishman made the International Cricket Council’s one-day team of the year does not bode well.

However, Root - who got under the skin of both Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews in past skirmishes - is adamant they can launch a genuine bid for a first 50-over World Cup, starting on their seven-match tour of Sri Lanka later this month.

Joe Root believes England can win next year's World Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand

‘There’s not an expectation for us to do well, which could work out for us,’ Root said. ‘We know we have the squad of players to do really good things and a lot of young, exciting players. Not a lot of people have seen what they can do yet. Again, that could play into our hands.’

One man who believes Root’s optimism is misplaced is India legend Sachin Tendulkar. 

He was at Lord’s on Friday to launch his autobiography and, when asked if England had a chance to lift the World Cup - which begins on February 14 in Australia and New Zealand - said: ‘Anything is possible in this sport but going by current form I don’t think England will be that competitive.’
