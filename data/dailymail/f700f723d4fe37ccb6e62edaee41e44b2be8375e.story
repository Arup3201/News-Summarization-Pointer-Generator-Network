A carpenter was found inside his van laden with 132 empty lager cans... which he parked on a 70mph dual carriageway after mistaking it for a lay-by.

The van had no lights on and the engine was turned off after Jason Teesdale had mistaken the main road for a lay-by, a court heard.

Teesdale, 42, was more than four times over the drink drive limit when the incident happened.

The carpenter mistook the A38 for a lay-by, and was found asleep by police officers with lager and cider cans in his van

Prosecutor Mike Brown said the carpenter 'had essentially mistaken the 70mph road for a lay-by' and posed a 'significant danger' to himself and other road users on the A38 in Cornwall.

Police found 132 empty cans of lager in the van as well as half a bottle of wine, three cans of strong cider and a sealed bottle of wine.

Teesdale, from St Austell, Cornwall, told police he thought he was in a lay-by.

He admitted being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle after his arrest in the early hours of Saturday.

Mr Brown said a policeman found the VW Transporter parked in the west bound carriageway of the road near Liskeard.

He was unable to open the driver's door but there was a strong smell of alcohol when he opened the window.

After the officer had moved the vehicle to a safe place he gave Teesdale a breath test which led to an 'incredibly high reading' - 146 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath - the legal top limit is just 35.

Teesdale told police his last drink had been at 8pm the night before.

Bodmin magistrates court heard he has a previous drink drive offence from 2001.

Alexis Hager, defending, said the empty cans in the van didn't necessarily correspond to the amount he had drunk and said they were in the vehicle to be taken for recycling.

Teesdale had been 'genuinely surprised' by the high level of the reading and had only had a couple of glasses of strong red wine.

Ms Hager said he was going through a protracted divorce and was under 'substantial emotional pressure'.

The case has been adjourned for reports and Teesdale was bailed.
