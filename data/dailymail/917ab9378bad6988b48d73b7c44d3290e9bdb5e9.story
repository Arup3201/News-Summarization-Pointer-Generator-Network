Nick Clegg was embroiled in a fresh ‘cash-for-honours’ row last night after the extent of the party’s financial dependence on millionaire backers who have been made peers became apparent.

Of all cash donations to the party in 2012, more than £600,000 – or 40 per cent – came from just three wealthy supporters – and all three have recently been appointed to the House of Lords by Mr Clegg, a Daily Mail investigation found.

They are among 34 Lib Dems who have been given life peerages by Mr Clegg since the 2010 election – compared with an average of only four a year between 1997 and 2009.

This is despite Mr Clegg’s complaints that the House of Lords is undemocratic and should be fully elected to stop politicians stuffing it with cronies.

The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to be planning to give several more peerages to Lib Dem politicians who were kicked out by voters in the recent European and local elections.

Mr Clegg is facing awkward questions over alleged cash for honours after senior Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott quit the party last month complaining he had failed to ‘expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own’.

Scotland Yard has been urged by SNP MP Angus MacNeil, who sparked the cash-for-honours scandal that engulfed Tony Blair’s government, to investigate whether any honours were sold in return for donations.

Awkward questions: Nick Clegg has insisted the House of Lords should be more democratic

He said: ‘Lord Oakeshott’s comments are bigger than any admission that emerged through the last cash-for-honours investigation. We need full disclosure of which members of the Lords he is talking about, and what they gave in return for a peerage.’

It is Lib Dem policy to back a fully-elected House of Lords. Mr Clegg says it is a ‘flawed institution’ with no democratic mandate, held up by an ‘unsustainable status quo’. But this has not stopped him using his power of patronage as Deputy PM to appoint dozens of Lib Dem life peers.

Money problems have made the Lib Dems even more reliant on their richest benefactors. The party was £713,000 in debt at the start of this year. Membership is falling and since forming the Coalition they no longer qualify for nearly £2million a year in public funding for opposition parties.

They have become dependent on money from a small coterie of businessmen who have been given prestigious positions in the Lords, an analysis of party accounts and Electoral Commission figures shows.

Mr Clegg made clothing magnate Raj Loomba, 70, a peer in November 2010, and appointed nightclub impresario James Palumbo, 51, and Domino’s Pizza tycoon Rumi Verjee, 56, to the Lords last August.

The three men gave the Lib Dems £605,000 in 2012, representing 40 per cent of the total cash donations of £1,494,274 received that year.

Lord Loomba and Lord Verjee – the latter via his firm Brompton Capital – were jointly the largest single donors, each giving £250,000. Lord Palumbo’s Ministry of Sound provided £105,000. In 2011 they gave £408,642, making up just under 23 per cent of all cash donations.

They donated the even larger total of £632,097 in 2013, although this cannot be compared to the party’s total income because full accounts for the year have not yet been released.

These figures represent only part of the total amount given to the party’s central office, individual MPs and local constituency organisations by the recently-ennobled millionaires and their families over the years.

Lord Palumbo has donated £1,004,757 to the Lib Dems, Lord Verjee has provided £1,156,326 and Lord Loomba has handed over £361,597, with nearly all of his donations coming since he was appointed to the Lords.

'I’m not saying it’s as crude as saying, “You give us £100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage”, but I bet there’s a few nods and winks'

Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life

Lib Dem donor turned peer Paul Strasburger, 67, has along with his wife given the party £870,613 since 2005. Sudhir Choudhrie, 64, whose family has donated £1,572,492 to the Lib Dems since 2004, was put forward for a peerage last year but was reportedly passed over amid concerns at that time about hospitals and care homes run by his family firm.

The Lib Dems ran a deficit every year from 2008 to 2012, while membership slumped 35 per cent in two years to stand at just over 42,000 in 2012.

Donors are not banned from becoming peers, but they are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which rules on ‘whether or not the individual could have been a credible nominee if he or she had made no financial contribution’. However, it is a crime to sell peerages.

Sir Alistair Graham, ex-chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘All parties, but particularly the Liberal Democrats and to a lesser extent Labour, are so dependent on these big donors that they will go to considerable lengths to attract them. I’m not saying it’s as crude as saying, “You give us £100,000 and we will put your name forward for a life peerage”, but I bet there’s a few nods and winks.’

The Lib Dems and all the Lords in question deny suggestions that their peerages were given in return for donations.

An earlier version of this article reported previously published claims that Sudhir Choudhrie is an 'arms dealer'. Mr Choudhrie has contacted us to say that he has repeatedly denied dealing in arms. We are happy to make this clear.
