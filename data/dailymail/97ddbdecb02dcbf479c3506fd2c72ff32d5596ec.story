From snakes to lizards, geckos and even stick insects, the animal-loving British aren't afraid to take unlikely pets to heart.

But the slimy jellyfish has confounded all attempts to domesticate it - until now that is.

So delicate are the wobbly fish, 
attempts to keep them as pets have ended in death for the jellyfish 
thanks to the filters used in tanks for tropical fish.

Expensive: Jellyfish Art's specially designed jellyfish aquarium comes complete with wibbly residents

But now a US company has managed to design a filter-free tank, which comes complete with a family of moon jellyfish to enjoy.

The world’s first domestic aquarium designed specifically for the translucent medusas is available from Jellyfish Art and comes fitted with LED lights to brighten up the tank and its colourless occupants.

The seven-gallon tank is circular in shape and uses a unique pump system to circulate water in a controlled swirl, nudging the fish gently away from the sides of the tank and clear of the dangerous filter valves.

The specially designed jelly keeping kit costs $382 (£238) plus VAT and shipping charges, and includes the tank, a small family of moon jellyfish and a three ounce bag of specialist jellyfish food.

Although the website is based in America, it will FedEx the jelly kit to the UK, although it won't ship  live jellyfish abroad.

Peaceful: Watching moon jellyfish drifting about their business is said to have a soothing effect

Jellyfish Art sells the tanks and the moon jellyfish to go in them, as well as cleaner snails and hermit crabs

British would-be jellyfish owners can pick up theirs from Aquarium Architecture, which will happily source moon jellyfish (£65 each plus £95 overnight delivery charges) and other marine life for British clients.

The British company is also licensed to sell the tanks, although they cost a lot more than the US equivalent - £475 for a standard tank containing a single jellyfish.

So are the translucent fish good pets? According to Jellyfish Art, they are a soothing, low maintenance alternative to tropical fish.

A spokesman for the website said: 'I would have to have to say the fact that they are kind of 'exotic' is probably a draw for a lot of people.

'Being one of the first to own a new thing. Another thing I hear people mention is that they want them to be a form of relaxation and just sit around and watch the jellies float around.'

The website also sells special jellyfish feeding kits, as the marine beasts can't survive on regular fish food.

'Jellyfish Art provides a Frozen Jellyfish Food specifically formulated for jellyfish made from plankton high in HUFAs (Highly Unsaturated Fatty Acids), which are essential for proper nutrition,' adds the spokesman.

'We strongly suggest only feeding jellyfish with our recommended food. Other fish foods that claim to be suitable for jellyfish are often low quality.'

But whether or not you feed your jellies the HUFA mix recommended by Jellyfish Art, your time as the proud owner of your very own jellyfish could be brief, as moon jellyfish are notoriously short-lived.

The would-be pets survive less than two months in the wild, although they do replace themselves quickly - wild adult moon jellyfish produce larvae every day.

If yours prove less fertile, Jellyfish Art or Aquarium Architecture will send replacements but they don't come cheap: a small jellyfish costs $39 (£24) while a large one is $55 (£34) plus postage and packaging.

But be careful if you decide to replace your lost jelly with one of the site's $5 hermit crabs.

Unlike the short-lived jellyfish, hermit crabs can live up to 32 years in captivity so you could find yourself with a pet for life!

1. It doesn't sting: Unlike poisonous relatives such as the Portuguese Man O'War, the moon jellyfish doesn't sting. That ought to make cleaning the tank a bit easier!

2. It only lives for six months in the wild: Although wild moon jellyfish live for less than six months in the wild, they can live for several years in an aquarium if professionally cared for.

3. Although it's transparent and tiny, it has four names: Along with its Latin name, Aurelia aurita, moon Jellyfish are also known as 'common jellyfish' and 'saucer jellyfish'.

4. Moon Jellyfish are found EVERYWHERE: The jellyfish are found in seas all over the world, including those that lap the British shore. If you don't fancy splashing out $39 on an American jelly, you could always head to Cornwall, where moon jellyfish are regularly seen floating just off beaches and in harbours.

5. It doesn't have the ability to poo: The moon jellyfish is one of the world's most basic animals and has very few body parts. Although it has tentacles and four gonads, which it uses to digest its food and reproduce, it has no circulatory, respiratory or excretory systems.

Jellyfish can't be kept in regular aquariums because they get sucked into the filter and shredded by the fan

Unfortunately the non-stinging moon jellyfish that come with it only live for a maximum of six months
