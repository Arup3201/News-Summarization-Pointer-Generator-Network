Coronation Street actress Liz Dawn is set to undergo an operation to have a pace-maker fitted.

The 73-year-old, who is known to millions of soap fans as Vera Duckworth, was told the life-saving procedure was essential after she suffered a heart attack in May.

The ITV soap star, who already suffers from the incurable lung disease, emphysema, is set to go under the knife on Friday.

A source told The Sun the disease has reduced her lung capacity to 30 per cent which puts extra strain on her heart.

Liz, who smoked 24 cigarettes a day, was in the soap for 34 years before leaving due to health problems in 2008.

Despite giving up smoking 15 years ago, she has been left needing to use a wheelchair.

Coronation Street stars past and present
 have rallied round the popular actress, who left the soap in 2007 after
 being diagnosed with emphysema, sending messages of support to the 
soap's 'tough old bird'.

Millions watched as her character died
 in her sleep in 2007 but she briefly made a return in 2010 as Vera's 
'spirit' when her screen husband Jack Duckworth, played by Bill Tarmey, 
left the soap.

Liz was left grief-stricken after Bill died in November 2011 and said she 'missed him terribly.'

Liz, who was hospitalised briefly this year due to health problems, said her mission for 2013 was to 'stay alive'.

She said: 'I've only made one plan for 2013 - to make sure I am alive this time next year. If not for the doctors, I wouldn't be here today. But my health is very bad.'

Her real-life love: Liz with her husband Donald who she said does everything for her

She revealed in the interview that only a third of her lungs work, adding: 'Thank god I have ten years of it. I wished I never smoked.

'My husband Donald does everything with me. I am reliant on him for everything.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Liz Dawn for comment.
