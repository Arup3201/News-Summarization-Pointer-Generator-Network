President Barack Obama shared a table with director Steven Spielberg and singer Bruce Springsteen during a star-studded benefit dinner in Los Angeles.

The U.S. President was the guest of honour at a fundraiser celebrating the USC Shoah Foundation, a project Spielberg established 20 years ago to collect video testimonies from survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides.
