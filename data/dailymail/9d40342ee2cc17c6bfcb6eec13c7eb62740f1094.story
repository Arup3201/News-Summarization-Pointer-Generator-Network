Talk about causing a stink. A 'mystery pooper' has reportedly soiled a New Zealand swimming pool for five Friday nights in a row. 

The frustrated administrators of Invercargill's Splash Palace complex have lost thousands of dollars of business cleaning up after a patron's foul play, stuff.co.nz reported.

One evening was particularly disastrous, with managers having to close three different pools as those responsible leap-frogged from one pool to another. 

Splash Palace, pictured, describes itself as one of New Zealand's premier pools. Unfortunately, a so-called 'mystery pooper' has reportedly soiled the waters five times, requiring six hours of cleaning

Manager Pete Thompson told Fairfax: 'They did one in the leisure pool and we moved the kids to the learners' pool, and they did one in the learners' pool and we moved the kids to the main pool, and one appeared in the main pool, so we had to shut the whole thing down.

'In one of those pools was diarrhoea ... that was unfortunate.'

Mr Thompson said the incidents occurred after 5pm on Friday evenings.  

It is unclear whether one person or more is behind the incident, with a local councillor quoted saying: 'We have a mystery pooper'.

It won't help Invercargill's sometimes battered reputation. 

According to local folklore, a member of the Rolling Stones once dubbed the city the 'a***hole of the world'.
