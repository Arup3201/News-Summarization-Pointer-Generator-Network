A mother with terminal cancer was given an extra-special birthday treat by her family – a surprise flash mob featuring 50 of her closest friends and family from five different states.

They dance to The Emotions’ 1977 hit Best Of My Love and a clip of the performance – called A Flash Mob For Amy! - has become an internet sensation, with over half a million views registered on video sharing site Vimeo.

The reaction of the mother, artist Amy Wagner, is played simultaneously with the dance in an inset screen and she whoops with delight throughout, describing it as ‘amazing’.

Movers and shakers: Amy (inset) registers her delight as 50 of her friends and family form a flash mob, dancing to Best Of My Love

Three-sy does it: The clip, which has gone viral, starts with just a handful of Amy's closest relatives dancing in front of her

Numbers swell: Within seconds the group has grown, with people running on to the lawn from hiding spots at the side of the house

.

The video begins with a touching message from 56-year-old Amy’s family, who explain that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in October 2012.

The news ‘rocked the family’, but the situation looked brighter after several months of chemotherapy and surgery, the message says.

Sadly, in October 2013, doctors revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable.

But Amy’s family and friends remained determined to make the most of the time they had left.

The message on the video continues: ‘Being present in the moment is of the utmost importance; as Amy says, “dum vivimus vivamus… while we live, let us live.”’

The flash mob clearly invokes this positive spirit.

Happy day: At the end of the performance the troupe rushes forwards to hug Amy

The idea of a flash mob was dreamt up by Amy's daughter, social worker Lauren Keppel, who thought that it would emphasize to her mom just how significant she was, as the family have a great love of music.

Keppel choreographed the routine with her best friend, Christina Noellsch, who later uploaded the video to Vimeo.

The clip begins with Amy being led out to a chair in the backyard of her home in Wheaton, near Chicago, by Ms Keppel, her husband and Amy's husband, Scott Hindsley.

Then the track begins and the three present begin dancing on the lawn in time with the music.

But three very quickly becomes 50, with friends and family running from hiding spots at the side of the house.

Amy’s reaction is one of joyous amazement as the troupe perform their routine.

At the end they all rush forward to give Amy a hug.

Amy told Today: 'It is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. I just love them all so much. I am really, really blessed.'

Ms Keppel told MailOnline: 'The original intent of this flash mob was simply to remind my mom of how surrounded by love she is. We recorded it so that she could re-watch it in times of struggle, and so that the 50 of us who participated could watch her beautiful reactions once she's no longer with us.

'The fact that the video has traveled the globe has been incredible and overwhelming. We are so grateful to be able to share the essence of my mom's love with the world.' 

For Ms Noellsch the highlight was seeing just how happy it made Amy.

She said: 'Just being there to see Amy's reaction in the moment was amazing and beautiful. The fact that the world is getting to see it is even better!'

The video, filmed on May 10, a day before Amy's 56th birthday, has received dozens of comments from touched Vimeo users.

Tabitha Escobedo wrote: 'Oh happy day, oh happy day, what a great way and purpose for getting together friends!'

Janet 1, meanwhile, said: 'OK, I joined Vimeo just so that I can leave this comment because I am so moved by this video. What a beautiful smile on Amy. Her laughter and expressions are priceless. This video is of a beautiful lady and her beautiful family.’
