The Abbott government is considering a major shake-up of the Australian Federal Police that could lead a new homeland security division.

The Daily Telegraph reports the new top-level national security is expected to be appointed to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet boss Ian Watt and could be released before next year.

It comes just days after officials revealed as many as 250 Australians could be supporting the Islamic State, as they continue to radicalise young fighters such as the 'ginger jihadist'.

While the nation's top spy agency ASIO has been confiscating passports and setting up airport terror checks, prompting fears of homegrown terrorist attacks.

The AFP have confirmed jihadist Abdullah Elmir could face 25 years in jail if he ever sets foot on Australian soil again after he appeared in the ISIS video rant against western society. 

The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video.

The federal government has also fast-tracked new laws forcing telecommunication companies to retain metadata for police and intelligence agency investigations.

Police and spy agencies will have a better chance of catching terrorists and other criminals under the new mandatory data retention scheme, according to the federal government.

Last week, it was reported that Australia’s most senior Islamic State militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei was killed in the Middle East.

The news came as Labor joined the coalition to pass foreign fighter laws.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the laws would make it easier to arrest and jail terrorists returning from overseas, monitor potential terrorists in Australia and stop 'preachers of hate'. 

Following the biggest anti-terrorism raids in Australian history, the Abbott government warned Australians who join terrorist groups abroad or those who return from the Islamic State will be dealt with

Mr Abbott promised to spend an additional $630 million on counterterrorism measures to combat the threat of Australians returning home from battlefields in the Middle East

Following the biggest anti-terrorism raids in Australian history, the Abbott government warned Australians who join terrorist groups abroad or those who return from the Islamic State will be dealt with. 

The anti-terror raids saw at least 800 police officers were involved, with 25 search warrants and 15 arrested in Sydney, with four people charged, including one accused of plotting to kidnap and kill members of the public.
