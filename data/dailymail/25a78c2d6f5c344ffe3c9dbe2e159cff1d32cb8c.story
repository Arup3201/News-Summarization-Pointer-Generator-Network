Food mash-ups seem to be all the rage these days, with the rise of the cronut and more recently the Ramen Burger causing a buzz in the culinary world.

But one fusion creation has been satisfying the appetites of San Francisco's fast food fans for the last two years.

The sushi burrito - sushi wrapped in a huge burrito - has been gaining notoriety in the city since Peter Yen and chef Ty Mahler unveiled their creation long before the latest craze for culinary clashes.

The restaurant chain has opened three stores in San Francisco

Their business, Sushirrito, currently runs three shops in the city selling its unique brand of Asian and Latin fast food.

According to Business Insider, the company has been operating in the city for the last two years.

The company sells a variety of sushi burritos, such as the Sumo Crunch, featuring surimi crab and shaved cabbage, and the Geisha's Kiss, which is made from yellowfin tuna.

According to its website, the business was founded by Mr Yen, who was frustrated with the lack of choice in restaurants selling sushi in downtown San Francisco.

In 2010 he joined forces with Ty Mahler, the former executive chef of Roy's Hawaiian Fusion in the city, to create Sushirrito.

Earlier this month MailOnline reported how the latest food craze to hit the streets of New York City was the Ramen Burger.

The creation of chef Keizo Shamamoto is a juicy hunk of meat topped with scallions and arugula and stuffed between two mounds of fried noodles.

And in May the cronut - half croissant, half donut - was revealed to the world before quickly becoming a culinary craze.

The cronut is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian vanilla cream.
