The BBC sent 140 crew members to cover Nelson Mandela's memorial despite receiving more than 1,000 complaints over its 'excessive' coverage of his death.

The number of staff dedicated to the iconic leader's death was far greater than its rivals, including ITV which reportedly despatched just nine staff to South Africa.

News of the figures emerged as nearly 1,500 viewers complained that local news was being sidelined in favour of coverage of Mr Mandela's death, including some who grumbled about a repeat of Mrs Brown's Boys being interrupted.

The BBC has defended 
the extent to which it featured the death of the former South African 
president, a major news item which led bulletins around the world.

By
 yesterday, the corporation had received 1,350 complaints about too much
 coverage across its news services, with some saying the emphasis had 
reduced the coverage of severe weather across the UK that day.

The
 BBC has defended its coverage and said Mandela's death was of 
'considerable interest' to audiences in the UK and across the rest of 
the world.

A spokeswoman 
for the BBC told the Daily Telegraph: 'Over a ten-day period, we expect 
to have deployed around 120 journalists, technicians and support staff 
to work on this huge international story.

'They
 are providing coverage of events from a number of different locations 
across TV, radio and online. We will begin to scale back our deployment 
on Wednesday.'

Hundreds of world leaders including President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro were joined by thousands of ordinary South Africans and Mr Mandela's family to pay tribute to the anti-apartheid hero at the FNB football stadium today.

Mr Obama led the tributes by calling Mr Mandela a 'giant of history'.

Mr Obama opened his speech by thanking Mandela's family, then continued: 'To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us.

'His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.'

The U.S. President compared Mr Mandelaâ€™s actions to those of Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln and US civil rights leader Martin Luther King but also warned against viewing Mr Mandela as detached from normal life.

'He was not a bust made of marble, he was a man made of flesh and blood,' he told the crowds in the stadium including leaders from more than 90 countries gathered at the stadium.
