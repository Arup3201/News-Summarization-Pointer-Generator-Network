The only word I can use to describe my feeling over the last few days is distraught, really. The night we lost to Bangladesh I found myself staring at the floor in disbelief and I was trying to work out in my own mind what happened. Then over the next couple of days it started to sink in and the disappointment turned to anger. Anger at ourselves. It was in our hands and the players have to take every bit of heat we get because we were in a very winnable position in that game. We just didn’t take to the pressure well at all.

What went wrong?

It’s tricky as players to try to offer an explanation because it can sound like an excuse. But I will try. Did we lack a bit of experience? You look at the big teams here at this World Cup and most of the players have played a lot more one-day internationals than us. There’s always a temptation to call for change at times like this but my gut feeling would be to keep this group of players together to get them that experience over the next four years before the next World Cup. We don’t play as much one-day and Twenty20 cricket as others because of our schedules but we have to find a way to be honest so we can get that experience. You learn how to win games in tricky positions and the pressure of winning a game for England is completely different to doing it for your county.

Don’t blame the coach

It’s unfair to pin the blame on Peter Moores. We’ve worked a lot on our game and the coach can’t do anything about the players not being able to take the heat of the battle when it most matters. Coaches try to teach that but you only really get it by winning and losing at the highest level. I’m reading a book called The Unstoppable Golfer by Bob Rotella and a lot of what he says applies to cricket. It’s about players taking responsibility to get into a position to handle the pressure. There was no reason why we couldn’t have beaten Bangladesh on that flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval. No reason why we shouldn’t have been able to chase 275.

Below my best

It’s stating the obvious to say I haven’t taken the amount of wickets I would have liked in this tournament but it’s never the definitive way to judge how you have bowled. I like to judge myself on the processes, whether I’ve hit the right areas and whether I’ve created chances. I feel like I have created chances but I’ve not hit the right areas as consistently as I’d like to have done. At the start of the tournament I tried to bowl as quickly as I could but found I wasn’t moving the ball as much as I’d like. So against Bangladesh I changed that and tried to bowl a bit more as if it was a Test and looked for movement. That was better but it took me too long to figure it out in these conditions. I’ve not been happy with myself but it’s such a shame it’s been cut short because there’s a lot of cricket left in this tournament. This group had a lot more expectation than we’ve shown but hopefully a lot of them will be around to grow over the next couple of years.

The obsession with statistics

I really don’t know where that has come from. It’s completely wrong to say we are obsessed with statistics or over-analyse things. In my eight or nine years of England touring this trip has seen fewer meetings than ever before. There’s also been the least number of stats flying around. If you are winning then people say you are fantastically prepared if you have good analysis but if you’re losing it becomes something to take aim at. If you want information on your game or an opponent’s then it’s available to you but we haven’t had anything thrown at us.

Moving on

It’s still very raw going out of this World Cup at this stage and that frustration and anger is still there. I’m disappointed with how I played and I’m sure all the guys feel the same. It’s natural and if those feelings weren’t there you would have to ask questions. I feel embarrassed to be honest. Another book I read recently was Roy Keane’s and he’d say that if Manchester United lost on a Saturday when he played he’d be embarrassed to leave his home on a Sunday. That’s how I’m feeling right now but games and challenges come round so quickly that you have to pick yourself up as soon as you can. We can’t afford to sulk.

A one-day future

I’m only 28 and I want to continue playing one-day cricket for England. Look at the best teams here and they all have experience in their teams. I’ve not shown enough quality in this tournament but the next World Cup is in England and my record is good at home. You can’t say what’s going to happen in the next four years but I’d certainly like to play a key role leading up to the next one. They say a bowler’s peak is from 28 to 33 so why wouldn’t I want to play? I know we are the only team who plays all-year round and that means a lot of cricket but I try to give myself the best opportunity I can to play for England as often as I can. I rest where possible and I haven’t been to the Indian Premier League. That’s because I want to play for England and I want to keep on doing that in all forms.

A modern approach

We’ve got the players to produce the modern brand of cricket we are seeing in one-day cricket, of course we have. Look at people like Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and Joe Root. It’s just that we haven’t delivered it here. Those guys will have a significant number of one-day caps when they play in the next World Cup and that will give them more expertise and more confidence. We must make sure that we accept it if guys like those get out at times playing the modern way and someone like Mo can definitely bat as fluently at the top of the order as some of the players we have seen at this tournament. He just has to be backed to do so. I think the right 15 players were in this World Cup squad and we can only look at ourselves as to why we haven’t justified the faith placed in us. It will take a long time to get over what’s happened here it is what it is and if we don’t learn from it that will be criminal. There is a lot of exciting cricket ahead and that has got to be our focus now.
