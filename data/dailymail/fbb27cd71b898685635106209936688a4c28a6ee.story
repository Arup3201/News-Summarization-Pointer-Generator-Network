A heartbroken ten year-old girl has recorded her own heart-rending song in memory of her sister who lost her fight against an inoperable brain tumour.

Charley Holmes penned By Your Side as a touching tribute to her older sister Katy who died two years ago at the age of just 10.

Charley, who also has a younger sister Scarlet, was devastated when Katy was diagnosed.

She insisted on helping with all of Katy's needs and her parents Paula and Dave said her 'cheerfulness, love and attention made a massive difference before Katy's death.

Charley, of Penwortham, near Preston, Lancashire, started attending Step Into Music classes and wrote her song after her third week.

She recorded it just before Christmas and it proved an instant hit with her family.

Mrs Holmes said: 'We put it on. Then we played it again, then we put it on repeat.

'Dave and I just fell apart. Charley has written down her innermost, deepest thoughts and turned it into a story.

'The team at the class have worked with her and helped her to make it into a beautiful song that anyone can relate to.

'We never expect her to do anything and always let her lead us. This was all her doing. 

'She chose to write her feelings down. She chose to turn it into a song. She chose to record it.'

She added: 'We're so proud of Charley - Katy will be beaming.

If you were here with me nowI'd find a way to say somehowThe words that I should have saidNow I cannot hideNow I cannot hideI love youI miss youI wish I could see you again X2You never got to say goodbyeMy love for you will never dieOne day in the distant futureI'll be back by your sideI'll be back by your sideI love youI miss youI wish I could see you again X2Now that you have gone awayI wish that you'd come back one dayNow I'm all aloneI'm all tornI love youI miss youI wish I could see you again X4

'Charley said she feels like she is doing something very special to honour her sister and make her proud in a way she feels is the most loving.

'She also said it will help other children who have lost someone understand that they are not alone.'

'Proceeds from the song, which is available on iTunes and Google Play, will go to the Katy Holmes Trust.

The Trust was set up and is dedicated to raising awareness of paediatric brain tumours. Singer Russell Watson and footballer Clarke Carlisle are patrons.
