Hundreds of people traffickers and drug dealers have been rounded up by European police in an operation unprecedented in scale, officials announced.

Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) played a big role in Operation Archimedes, which over the past nine days has seen more than 1,000 arrests in a continent-wide sweep against organised crime.

The operation was carried out in more than 300 cities, ports, airports and border crossings and involved 20,000 policemen from all 28 countries of the European Union and six non-European countries.

Crime sweep: The scale of Operation Archimedes was unprecedented

Police identified 200 victims of human trafficking and saved 30 Romanian minors from trafficking. Some faced forced worked in prostitution or begging gangs, Europol, Europe's police organisation, said.

'It's the single largest coordinated assault on organised crime ever seen in Europe,' Britain's Rob Wainwright, the head of Europol, told a news conference at the organisation's headquarters.

He said the operation was made necessary by the increasing sophistication and interconnectedness of Europe's crime groups, many of whom were using the hard-to-monitor 'dark net' - or encrypted internet - to communicate with each other.

'Months in the planning, it was a carefully coordinated series of attacks on key nodal points and crime sectors that underpin the underground crime economy in Europe,' he said.

'What we have seen emerging is an integrated underground criminal economy,' he said.

Arrests were concentrated on criminal middlemen and go-betweens, as crime kingpins are not typically caught in sweeps but in operations designed to ensnare them.

Dubbed 'Operation Archimedes', 1,027 arrests were made between September 15 and 23. Authorities seized 599kg of cocaine, 200kg of heroin and 1.3 tonnes of cannabis.

The operation yielded leads that would result in further investigations and arrests, Europol said.

Authorities in United States and Colombia also helped in identifying new drug trafficking routes to Europe, including drugs increasingly being shipped in parcels sent by post.

An NCA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have been involved in Operation Archimedes, sharing intelligence and working to help disrupt criminal activity.

'Serious organised crime doesn't recognise boundaries - cybercrime for instance affects everyone - so we have to have a joint approach to tackle it. We all need to work together to protect ourselves. No UK nationals have been arrested so far as we're aware.'
