The Modern Family beauty, 41, dated Paciello - a handsome Miami nightclub owner who did time for his part in a mob-related murder - in the late 1990s.

And after announcing her split from Loeb just over a week ago, a source said: 'The split was in part due to Chris and the fact he and Sofia are still friends, on some level Sofia will always care about Chris and that drove Nick crazy.'

Ex-loves: Actress Sofia Vergara is said to still be friendly with former boyfriend Chris Paciello (seen together in September 2008), a Miami nightclub owner who went to jail for his part in a mob-related murder.

'Nick was jealous because Sofia and Chris are close and she is investing in some of his clubs in Miami.

'And to be honest, for Sofia, Chris has always been the one that got away.'

It was at Paciello's club on New Year's Eve 2012 that Sofia and Loeb got into a fight which ended with the star's dress being ripped and Loeb being thrown out by security.

Paciello, now 42, previously had connections with New Springville Boys in his youth, a gang with affiliations to the Bonanno crime family.

Moving from New York to Miami, Paciello - born Christian Ludwigsen - hung 
out with Madonna, Jennifer Lopez and everyone who was anyone in 1990's South Beach, where he ran the club Liquid with Madonna's pal Ingrid Casares 
and dated Sofia.

'She was insane about him then,' says the source,' She would have married him then if she could have.'

But in December 1999, Paciello was arrested for for
 his involvement in planning a gang robbery which saw Judith Shemtov 
fatally shot in the head in 1993. He was charged for the mob-related murder and robbery, in which he was driver.

In 2000, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He served just seven years of his 10-year
 sentence after ratting out dozens of top Mafia figures, including 
members of the Bonanno family which ultimately led to the takedown of 
family boss Joseph 'Big Joe' Massino.

He and Sofia ended their romance then although the source says they remained friends and she remained in contact with him after he went to jail.

Once he was out, he went back to Miami and opened Bianca restaurant, in the Delano Hotel in South Beach, saying: 'I regret the mistakes I made in the 
past. I am working hard to make a positive impact and to build a new 
life for myself in Miami. I am grateful to the many people here who have
 welcomed me back with open arms, and look forward to a positive 
future.'

And in December 2012, he opened Story nightclub in South Beach.

The source said: 'She was with Nick, but still had a connection to Chris,' said the source: 'It wasn't a romance any more, but she makes a point of supporting anything that Chris does.

The calm before the storm: Modern Family beauty Sofia Vergara pulls a funny face as she joins former lover, Miami nightclub owner Chris Paciello, at Story on December 31, 2012. The night ended with her ex-fiance Nick Loeb being thrown out of the hotspot following a scuffle

'On some level she 
will always care about him and that drove Nick crazy. Every time they 
went to Miami, they saw Chris and even though Sofia said there wasn't 
anything like that between them any more, I think Nick was jealous of 
Chris' hold over Sofia.'

That
 boiled over on New Year's Eve, shortly after Story opened. Sofia and 
Loeb were at the club with friends to help Chris get publicity for the 
club.

Paciello
 and Loeb argued and eventually Loeb got into a fight with someone else 
and was kicked out, while Sofia got caught in the middle of the brawl 
and her dress was torn.

The former couple appeared to kiss and 
make up as they were pictured lounging in the sunshine by the pool the 
next day - with Loeb showing off scratches on his chest from the night 
before.

Sofia and Loeb had a notoriously combustible romance with several public spats, including one about a year ago at the airport in Miami.

'She
 has this unexplainable bond with Chris and Nick knows that,' says the 
friend. 'I'm sure he was jealous. She was even talking about having 
Chris help plan the wedding to Nick, before they broke it off.  She is 
this huge star and Chris should just be part of her past now, but he 
isn't.'

Scuffle: Nick Loeb shows off the marks of a row following a dispute that saw him thrown out of Miami's Story nightclub on New Year's Eve 2012 - the day after the fight

In August last year, Page Six reported that Paciello had been bought out of his stake in Story, receiving a $600,000 payout as part of his severance, sources said. He has gone on to work on new projects.

Announcing the end of her two-year engagement to Loeb, Sofia blamed the relationship's 
collapse on their inability to balance their professional and personal 
lives together.

Choosing to announce the bad news herself rather than through a publicist, Sofia wrote on her WhoSay profile: 'Not that
anyone should care, but in order to not give the press the chance to invent
crazy and hurtful drama, I prefer to tell my fans personally that Nick and I
have desided [sic] to be apart.

'We have been having too many problems with figuring
out how to spend time together and becouse [sic] of my work and now his, it's been
getting worse and worse, not fun anymore.

'We are still very close but we belive [sic] is the best
thing for us right now.
