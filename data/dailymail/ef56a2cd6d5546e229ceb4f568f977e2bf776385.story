Chelsea players believe Andre Schurrle will agree his return to Germany over the weekend.

The 24-year-old is the subject of an offer from Wolfsburg, as reported by Sportsmail, and is keen to join them and kickstart his career.

Schurrle has contributed to Chelsea during his time under Jose Mourinho but wants regular starts and more game time. Mourinho rates the World Cup winner but believes he needs to be more physical to handle the Premier League.

Chelsea hope to agree a fee close to £27million for a player they signed for £18m from Leverkusen in 2013.

Schurrle has given the impression to senior players that he is ready to go.

Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella has said he expects Juan Cuadrado to stay but that is reflective of Fiorentina's stance in their demand for his release clause or nothing. 

Real Sociedad have stepped into the race to sign Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah.

Intermediaries spoke to Real Sociedad officials in San Sebastian and the Egyptian is keen on the move. The proposed loan also has the blessing of Mourinho who was keen to help out David Moyes as he strives to make an impression on La Liga. 

Mourinho is expected to speak to the player further on Thursday.

The 22-year-old Salah wants to play and likes the idea of testing himself in Spain. 

Roma have made their offer of a £1m loan fee and £11m permanent fee to follow. 

A meeting between Chelsea, Roma and Salah's representatives began on Thursday while Monaco are also showing an interest.

Salah is in dispute with his former agent Oliver Kronenberg, a Swiss lawyer, and has had Italian agents acting on his behalf also.

QPR and Spartak Moscow have also expressed an interest but Salah is not overly keen on moving to Russia and has concerns about QPR's form.

Moyes also remains hopeful about signing Joel Campbell on loan from Arsenal and Etienne Capoue from Tottenham. 

Campbell though does have a lot of interest including that of Villarreal who have Arsenal target Gabriel Paulista.

Georgios Samaras will leave West Bromwich Albion for Al Hilal and pave the way for Tony Pulis to bring in Callum McManaman.

Talks are ongoing with Wigan who value McManaman at £6m but the offer so far is understood to be £2.25m up front with another £2m to follow in add-ons based on appearances and bonus upon Albion's survival.

Greece international Samaras, who joined the Baggies in August last year, is expected to head to the Middle East on a six-month loan with a view to a permanent deal. 

He arrived in the summer as a free agent after leaving Celtic but is one of a host of summer signings who have failed to make an impact at The Hawthorns, playing just eight times for the first team without scoring.

Back-up goalkeeper Luke Daniels has joined Scunthorpe on a free transfer, Silvestre Varela has completed a loan move to Parma and Sebastian Blanco is returning to Argentina with San Lorenzo.

Wigan, meanwhile, have had a £350,000 offer from Chicago Fire for Shaun Maloney. The 31-year-old rejected a £1m move to Leicester in favour of the MLS but so far the teams have yet to reach a compromise on the fee.

Swansea plan further talks over a move for Jordan Rhodes after Saturday's FA Cup tie with Blackburn.

Swansea have made initial enquiries about the valuation of the 24-year-old and his wages and will resume talks after the sides face each other.

Blackburn rejected £11m from Hull for Rhodes last summer and manager Gary Bowyer stressed the value placed on his strikers by his board when discussing the merits of Crystal Palace's £3.5m offer for Rudy Gestede on Wednesday. Rovers are determined to hold out for £5m for Gestede and value Rhodes even more highly.

Swansea are looking to replace Wilfried Bony, who joined Manchester City for £25million

Swansea are flush with cash from the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City and are braced for the departure of Bafetimbi Gomis. They have considered Newcastle's Papiss Cisse but have now made an approach over Scotland international Rhodes.

Rhodes has scored nine goals in 26 appearances this season as Blackburn have toiled for form. That is a relatively average return for a player who has been prolific throughout his career. 

He scored 25 in all competitions last season and 33 the season before. All told he has scored 62 goals in 116 games for Blackburn since signing from Huddersfield for £8m.

Queens Park Rangers and Southampton have also considered Rhodes over recent months.

Wigan FA Cup hero Ben Watson is wanted by Watford. 

The 29-year-old, who scored Wigan's FA Cup-winning goal against Manchester City in 2013, has made 10 appearances this season and scored one goal but is out of contract in the summer. 

Brighton and Reading have also shown an interest and Watson is understood to be keen on returning south.

He began his career at Crystal Palace and impressed under the coaching of Roberto Martinez. He has also developed into a dead-ball specialist, notably being brought on to take a high-pressure penalty against Stoke in 2011.

Reading  have signed Slovenian left-back Juve Travner after missing out on Hamilton's Stephen Hendrie.

Manager Steve Clarke was poised with a move for 20-year-old Hendrie but thought he was joining West Ham.

That move now looks in jeopardy after Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald branded West Ham 'shambolic' after they delayed sending an official offer for the Scotland Under 21 international. MacDonald's argument is that delay has cost Hamilton potential deals elsewhere.

Crystal Palace, Everton and Swansea have all been to watch Hendrie but have yet to make offers. Bournemouth and Celtic are also interested but West Ham could yet sign the player if issues can be resolved.

Derby, meanwhile, are interested in Hamilton's Spanish defender Jesus Garcia Tena.

Fulham hope to convince Robert Huth of joining them on loan from Stoke City when he returns from the Premier League club's break in Dubai. 

The German remains keen on a Premier League move but Stoke like the idea of having a 24-hour recall on him if he goes to the Championship. 

Watford and Reading have also made enquiries for the Berlin-born centre-back, who has been linked with West Bromwich Albion, but former boss Pulis is reluctant to deal with his old club Stoke. 

Fulham also retain an interest in West Brom midfielder Graham Dorrans and defender Chris Baird.

Millwall have made a move to sign Jos Hooiveld on loan from Southampton. The 31-year-old has been on loan at Norwich.

Ipswich town forward Cameron Stewart is being considered by Championship rivals. The 23-year-old former Manchester United and Hull winger could be made avaialble on loan in the coming days as Mick McCarthy weighs up his options. 

Stewart missed he start of the season with a broken jaw but made his debut as a substitute in the 1-1 FA Cup draw against Southampton and came on again as a late sub in the replay at Portman Road.

Manchester United defender Marnik Vermijl is wanted by Belgian side Lokeren. 

The 23-year-old has been with United since 2010 after joining from Standard Liege but has failed to make an impression on the first team. 

The Belgium Under 21 international right back spent most of the 2013-14 season on loan in Holland with NEC Breda.

Luton held talks with Andrew Johnson on Thursday about proposed deal and are waiting for the free agent striker to decide whether he wants to join.
