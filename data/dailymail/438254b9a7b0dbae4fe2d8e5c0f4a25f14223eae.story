You'd forgive Danny Welbeck for feeling a sense of de ja vu on Saturday.

Not only was he playing against Manchester United for the first time since leaving on transfer deadline day but, once more, we caught a glimpse of Welbeck the winger.

The England international has spent his Arsenal career as the main man; the central striker - playing in the position he so craved during his time at Old Trafford.

So you can only wonder what was going through his mind when he started the clash on the left wing, with Alexis Sanchez starting through the centre.

Occupying the left-flank at United was often a frustration for Welbeck, but with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie ahead of him in the pecking order it was the only way he could get a game under Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes.

Welbeck had been warned a move wide was coming, Arsene Wenger all but confirmed he would on Friday now Olivier Giroud - who started the match on the bench - is fit again.

It wasn't long, though, before we saw Welbeck moved back into his preferred role in the centre.

Likewise, it wasn't long before he was shifted back out wide - and then back to a central striker position for the end of first half.

Maybe, it was Wenger's way of easing him into a longer stint on the left flank once Giroud is fully match fit.

And, almost inevitably, Wenger sent Welbeck back out wide - to the right this time - once Giroud was introduce in the 77th minute.

You wonder what Welbeck was thinking when Giroud scored?

Perhaps he should get used to be being a wide-boy.
