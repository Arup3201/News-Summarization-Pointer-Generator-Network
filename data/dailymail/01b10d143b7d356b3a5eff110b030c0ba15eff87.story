In the six days following his selection by Mitt Romney for his presidential ticket, internet searches on Paul Ryan have focused not on his lean economic policy - but of him shirtless.

Thankfully now that search is over for his new legion of fans, excited by rumours the fitness fanatic Wisconsin Congressman is 'totally ripped' and unusually for a career politician was in possession of 'six pack'.

In a shirtless picture released today it is clear to see that the GOP vice-presidential nominee is in rude health as he walks hand in hand with his wife of 11 years Janna Little while on vacation in Oklahoma.

In fact this picture was taken six years ago, just before the conservative politician become an obsessive of the P90X workout which apparently has left his midsection more impressive-looking than in the above photograph.

A friend who is close to the Ryan family who said that Ryan had 'always led a healthy lifestyle' and that 'He's the nicest guy and has always been fit.'

Indeed, the interest in Ryan's levels of fitness carry personal significance for the 42-year-old seven-time Wisconsin representative.

When he was 16, Ryan tragically discovered his father had died at home in bed from a heart attack before the age of 60, just like his grandfather and great-grandfather and Ryan vowed to stay as healthy as he possibly could for the rest of his life.

It has been reported that he maintains a body fat index of between six and eight percent and compared to the over-worked politicians of Capitol Hill, six-foot-two Ryan strikes as a go-getting picture of health.

While Ryan has been picked by Romney to concentrate the election battle against President Obama to the economy, the U.S. media has in some cases simply chosen to ignore Ryan's much heralded 'Path to Prosperity' fiscal plan.

TMZ have said he 'may be the hottest vice presidential candidate ever… but we’re not talking policy.']

They go onto reveal that Ryan's workout's at the congressional gym are 'fierce' in addition to discussing the impressive body shape he has managed to build up.

'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he told Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill.

He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.' 

Founded by Tony Horton, an exercise 
instructor from Rhode Island, P90X is a home exercise system that aims 
to transform a person's body in just 90 days.

Extreme: Mr Ryan is a big fan of the regime and is said to lead a workout every morning at Capitol Hill

Muscles confusion is said to prevent a person from adapting to exercise, which results in continuous fitness improvement.

As the workout changes from day to day, he added that it offers a unique take on regular fitness routines.

Mr Ryan wears a heart-rate monitor when he works out and aims to hit a target heart rate of 165 beats per minute.

The youngest child of four children, Ryan described the motivation for his obsessive fitness program after discovering his father dead in bed.

'It was just a big punch to the gut,' he told The New Yorker magazine. 'I concluded I've for to either sink or swim in life.'

Active: Mr Ryan enjoys staying active and being outdoors. He is also a keen hunter (pictured) and skier and catfish noodler

Even liberal commentators have made comments on Ryan's perceived vitality and good looks.

Rachel Maddow of MSNBC has declared Ryan to be 'so handsome and boyish' while the New York magazine said that 'Paul Ryan is your annoying Libertarian ex-boyfriend.'

A website called heygirlsitspaulryan.tumblr.com, features pictures of Ryan with humourous and somewhat sexy headlines.

The gags combine politics with a seductive 'how you doing' vibe, attempting to make deficit reduction sexy.

'Hey girl... you know I can't inflate out love. And that would just devalue it anyways,' one photo reads, while another states: 'Hey girl... unlike the debt, our love will never hit a ceiling.'

Getting a bit saucy, another doctored photo says: 'Hey girl... My fiscal policy is all about contributing to your private sector. No, really.'

While another favourite reads: 'Girl, dry your tears. You know I'm-a balance the budget in ten years.'

And as Romney and Ryan prepare to take on President Obama and vice-president Joe Biden, even the New York Times has got in on the act labeling the pair 'cute Republican dudes'.

Some though, have waded in with an air of caution surrounding the Wisconsin action man who is known to enjoy catfish noodling, hunting and making his own sausages.

Psychology Today worried whether 'just because Paul Ryan is hot, does that mean he is also objectified?'

Speaking to RawStory.com., political and social analyst Rich Hanley of Quinnipiac University said that the attention being heaped on Ryan is understandable.

'It's more a commentary on how hot-less the Republican Party has been for so many years - that you get a fresh face and you call him a beefcake,' said Hanley.

Chosen: Paul Ryan, pictured campaigning this week, was picked as Republican Vice Presidential candidate last Saturday

'He represents, certainly to the conservative Republican voter, a guy who stays in shape, who has a youthful figure, something that's usually associated with Democrats.'

Mr Romney described Mr Ryan at his unveiling as his running mate as a man of integrity and character rooted in his middle-class Midwest upbringing as well as an intellectual leader at a time when the United States was in fiscal crisis.

'Paul is a man of tremendous character, shaped in large part by his early life,' he said. 'Paul's father died when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should.

'But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest.

'Paul Ryan works in Washington - but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.'

He praised Ryan's prowess in politics, saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul Ryan, but I don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and judgement.'
