She doesn’t seem to like the ubiquitous children’s entertainment company’s notion of beauty, but an artist recently used her impressive drawing skills to illustrate everything that goes into creating a Disney princess.

Say hello to the Disney Girls Tutorial, a step-by-step guide to building the perfect Disney princess.

Posted to deviantART by user Oceanstarlet, the guide, as it were, opens with question.

Who's the fairest? deviantART user oceanstarlet, AKA Meridith Viguet, posted a tongue-in-cheek but highly educational tutorial on drawing Disney princesses

‘Ever wanted to draw a Disney-style chick, but she ended up looking like a deformed Paris Hilton bobblehead?’

If so, Oceanstarlet can solve your problems.

In what may or may not be a jab at Disney’s uncommonly perfect and anatomically unattainable take on a young woman’s bodily and facial proportions, the artist uses her tutorial to guide the viewer through each and every facet of the Disney princess’s person that she believes makes them too good to be true all while showing exactly how bring them to life

Figured it out: Tips include not giving your princess hips or muscles of any kind. And the result is highly believable

First on Oceanstarlet’s check list is the Disney princess body type.

In a comparison with what she calls a regular woman’s figure, the Disney example of Jasmine—the princess from Aladdin—looks toothpick thin and waistless with feet that are ‘absolute-positive-lutely TINY.’

Agelessness is also part of being in the Disney Princess Universe, and according to Oceanstarlet, Ariel has timeless beauty down to a science. ‘Want to see their idea of a matured woman,’ she writes beside a picture of a childlike empress. ‘Look at Ariel, thirteen years after having her first kid, and at LEAST thirty. Lookin’ good, Queen Ariel.’

After bodies, Oceanstarlet moves on to faces and starts with what she calls the ‘Sugar Cookie Style’ girls.

Eurocentric: Caucasian princesses are distinct from the 'exotic' ones, and Viguet says most notably that the white girls all basically look the same

‘“Sugar cookie" is definitely not an official Disney term,’ Oceanstarlet writes on her deviantART page. ‘It's my name for all the European Disney princesses. They ARE a lot like sugar cookies: sparkly, white, and too sweet for their own good.’

The Sugar Cookie girls, most notably, seem to have ‘bulbous’ eyes pupils and full, womanly lips regardless of age.

‘The reason for the ginormous eyes,’ she writes, ‘is that it makes them look more child-like…the concept here is a little girl head on a teenager’s body with adult height (FREAKY!)’

Picasso gals: Meanwhile, Viguet shows how face, eye, and nose shape are all the differences needed to make the perfect 'Exotic' princess

Oceanstarlet then moves one to the ‘Exotic Style’ girls, which she says began in 1992 ‘when Disney discovered that there were more stories to be told outside England, Denmark, France, and Germany.’

These ‘exotic beauties’ include ‘East Asia Disney,’ ‘Native American Disney,’ ‘Romani Disney,’ all with detailed drawing how-tos.

By the end of the tutorial, Oceanstarlet accomplishes the impressive task of simultaneously educating her reader about Disney’s unrealistic beauty standards and exactly how to achieve them. At least on paper.
