In the first Hot or Not? of 2015, Ian Ladyman delivers his verdict on the big issues in the world of sport, revealing what helped him beat the winter chill and what left him feeling cold inside.

 WHAT'S HOT 

Phil Neville

During the Neville brothers’ years at Manchester United people used to joke that they liked Phil simply because 'he’s not Gary' and even the older sibling has softened enough to laugh at that one these days.

This week, though, brother Phil has shot up further in my estimation in the wake of his embarrassing revelation to Sportsmail’s Matt Lawton that he had never made a cup of coffee in his life.

Phil Neville, who was a Manchester United coach under David Moyes last season (right), proved he was game for a laugh when he posted a picture on Twitter in response to his wife's revelations about household chores

Neville's wife Julie landed him in it when she went on the radio but the ex-Everton man saw the funny side

Lampooned widely and without mercy, Neville’s domestic shame was deepened when his own wife Julie appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to reveal that Phil had never used any of their household cleaning appliances either. 

Faced with such embarrassment, Phil had a simple choice: Hide in a broom cupboard - provided he knows where it is - and wait for the storm to pass or join in the laughter.

His decision to subsequently post a photo of himself on Twitter alongside mop, hoover and cleaning trolley spoke volumes for a self-awareness lacking in too many sportsmen these days. 

Phil Neville: More than just Gary-lite.

David Warner

Thirteen months ago I sat at the Adelaide Oval as Warner headed back to the pavilion in the first innings of the second Ashes Test having scored a modest 29. 

After a poor and controversial Ashes summer in England that year - where he averaged 23 and tried to punch Joe Root in a Birmingham bar - I was confident enough to Tweet that he: 'will never be a Test batsman.'

Since that day in South Australia, Warner has played 24 Test innings and scored 83 not out, 60, 112, 9, 25, 16, 16, 12, 115, 70, 66, 135, 145, 133, 29, 19, 58, 145, 102, 29, 6, 0, 40 and 101. 

David Warner celebrates scoring a ton in the fourth Test against India at Sydney Cricket Ground

Warner kissed the ground after scoring 63 runs at the ground where Phillip Hughes was fatally injured

To save you reaching for the calculator, that represents an average of 63.7. 

Those tests have been played against England, South Africa, Pakistan and India, the quartet who - along with the Aussies themselves - make up the top-five Test teams in the world.

What’s more, his latest century this week came at the same Sydney Cricket Ground where Warner watched his great friend Phillip Hughes lose his life just two months ago. 

Warner is 28 and makes his runs in the most testing environment the game can offer, from the top of the batting order. 

Looks like I was wrong.

Sam Vokes

Even the most optimistic among us have days when we don’t feel very, well, optimistic. Welcome to the career of Burnley centre forward Vokes. 

Prior to this campaign, the 25-year-old had spent three seasons at a Premier League club without scoring a single goal or indeed making a start.

Ostensibly a Wolverhampton Wanderers player during their three years in the top division between 2009 and 2012, Vokes spent most of that time being shunted around Championship clubs on loan. 

Leeds, Bristol City, Sheffield United, Norwich City, Burnley and Brighton & Hove Albion all found a peg in their dressing room for Vokes during those three years. 

Sam Vokes opened his account for the season with a goal in the FA Cup draw with Tottenham Hotspur

His own club? Nah, no thanks. 

Last season, Vokes - benefiting from the sale of Charlie Austin to Queens Park Rangers - eventually got his career moving at Burnley, forming a partnership with Danny Ings that drove the Lancashire club to promotion to the Premier League. Then, in March, he bust his knee. 

So, that Premier League start - that moment of validation - still awaits him. But he was back on the pitch on Monday night, fit again and scoring in the FA Cup against Tottenham Hotspur. 

On Saturday, Burnley are at home to QPR. Keep an eye on the team sheet…..

WHAT'S NOT

Stuart Pearce

When the owners start sending their spies to watch training and - even worse - begin asking your players about you then it’s time to put the house up for sale and make sure you haven’t left any money down the side of the seat in the company car. 

For Nottingham Forest manager Pearce, the writing may just be on the wall at the City Ground. 

Laurie Whitwell’s revelations in Sportsmail that the Forest hierarchy are showing attention to detail in terms of their manager’s day-to-day workings may not concern supporters as much as a run of results that goes LLLDDDLWWLLLDLDDDLD all the way back to mid-September but they do add to the feeling that Pearce’s second coming by the Trent may be short. 

Stuart Pearce's days as Nottingham Forest manager appear to be numbered after a miserable run of results

There won’t be many people in England - except maybe in Derby - who wouldn’t wish a former England captain well but Pearce’s appointment always looked optimistic from the start. 

The emotional appeal was obvious for Forest but did Pearce really have the credentials to take the job on in the first place? 

His managerial CV contained two seasons in the Premier League with Manchester City (14th and 15th) and a spell as coach of the England Under 21s. Prior to this season he had never worked in the Championship. 

That would be a ‘no’ then.

Football tourists

I write this item from a position of disadvantage. I am 5ft 6in tall. Therefore anyone - and it’s just about everybody these days - holding a camera phone above their head at a concert, sporting event or museum - yes, that does happen - will receive black marks and possibly a nudge at the back of the knee from me. 

Imagine, therefore, the horror at seeing football fans turning up at Barclays Premier League grounds with selfie sticks this season.

Bolton boxer Amir Khan (holding the stick) appears to be a fan of the new gadget

They're fine in Times Square - just don't bring them to Premier League matches

For the uninitiated, the selfie stick is a long piece of metal you can attach your camera phone to the end of.

When held out in front of you, it gives you an ability to take photos of yourself from a range and angle that previously only Mr Tickle had enjoyed. 

Fine, perhaps, for a day out in Hyde Park but not, one would guess, for an afternoon at the football when it’s quite possible there may just be someone sitting behind, alongside or in front of you. 

Happily, Arsenal and Tottenham have taken the lead in banning these monstrous things. 

If other clubs follow suit we may finally be able to return to our national sport to those who are actually interested in watching it.

Ben Stokes

A stunning score of 77 from 37 balls for Melbourne Renegades in Australia’s marvellous ‘Big Bash’ competition should stand out as one of the young English all-rounder’s top career moments. 

Sadly, Stokes’ efforts may only prompt him to ask himself just why he is not in the England squad for the forthcoming World Cup. 

Ben Stokes was on fire for Melbourne Renegades, hitting 77 from 37 balls against Hobart Hurricanes

He may have his allies on Twitter - though an endorsement from Kevin Pietersen is not necessarily worth the phone it’s written on these days - but, among the England selectors, notice has understandably been taken of the 23-year-old’s relatively poor international form and question marks over his discipline.

Certainly Stokes emerged from last winter’s Ashes debacle as a positive, displaying skills and attitude that appeared quite beyond some of his senior colleagues. 

Kevin Pietersen, on Twitter, questioned why Stokes was not going to the World Cup with England

Since then, however, the Durham all-rounder will maybe have learned that it takes more than the ability to throw, catch and hit a ball to become an established international cricketer. 

Hopefully, while basking in the deserved praise that has followed his terrific innings, he will listen not to those with axes of their own to grind on social media but to the voices inside that will no doubt be reminding him that he has not done himself justice since his rise to prominence in Australia last January.
