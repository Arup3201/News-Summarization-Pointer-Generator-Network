These eerie photographs show a house left untouched since its owners left it more than a decade ago.

Known as the Crooked Cottage, this mysterious, rural Hertfordshire home still has a made-up double bed, full jars of gooseberries and a calendar.

It is said to have been lived in by a spinster and her father until he died in 1971. The daughter remained there until being taken into care.

Known as the Crooked Cottage, this rural Hertfordshire home is believed 
to have been untouched since its owners 
departed

Photographer Toby Batchelor, who discovered the inside of the house, was fascinated to discover a calendar dating back to December 1956

This double bed is still made up with sheets despite appearing not to have been slept in for more than a decade 

Left-over household items - including a women's bicycle, an old-style oven and family portraits - suggest no one has been in the house for years.

The inside of the home was discovered by Toby Batchelor, an urban explorer photographer.

'In the field of urban exploration it doesn’t get better than something like this,' the Derby man said.

An old-fashioned women's bicycle was found among other items in the Hertfordshire home

These old jars were found in the Crooked Cottage alongside an empty bottle of ale

Mr Batchelor was surprised to discover old-fashioned clothes hanging out of drawers on the inside of the house

'What we see is someone's life story, left to rot in this old, run-down cottage.

'There were lots of trinkets, family photos, furniture and items left behind which tell a story.'

The house is undisturbed, with clothes 
hanging out of old drawers, pickled fruit jars on kitchen surfaces and 
records waiting to be played on the vinyl player.

Even family photographs, in good condition, were found in the long-abandoned home

The foundations of the house appear to have eroded, leading to it being called the Crooked Cottage

According to legend, when the man who lived in this house died, his spinster daughter
 remained until she was taken into care because of her poor health

There are also portraits that look even older, including of two young girls with work aprons on.

The foundations of the house have eroded, leading to the home being called the Crooked Cottage.

'The building itself was so tiny, like something out of a film,' Mr Batchelor said.

'It had only one upstairs room and the whole building had began to be reclaimed by the elements.

'Locations like these don’t come up regularly and this one was kept secret for a long time.'

Found inside the house was this book, The Uninvited, by Dorothea Fairbridge, which was written in 1926

This organ was also found in the Crooked Cottage, which was photographed by Mr Batchelor, from Derby

Enthusiast Mr Batchelor said: 'What we see is someone's life story, left to rot in this old, run-down cottage'
