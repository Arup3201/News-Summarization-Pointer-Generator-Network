After being threatened with a knife and subjected to daily physical and verbal abuse for six years, one girl has fought back against her bullies and now become a successful model. 

Frankii Wilde, 27, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne was so scared of the bullies that she spent her break times hiding in the school building and even contemplated suicide.

But after being scouted by a modeling agency at the age of 17 and becoming a top pin-up model, Frankii has now had the last laugh. 

She even receives messages from the bullies who tormented her at school and now want to befriend her.

Fighting back: But after being scouted by a modeling agency at the age of 17, Frankii has become a top pin-up model

She says: 'The bullies made me feel so awful about myself and I felt I couldn't achieve anything. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become a model.

'In a way, what I suffered through school has given me the motivation and strength to do what I do now. I hope I've proved people wrong.'

Brave Frankii, who was born Charlotte Million, had been targeted by bullies for as long as she could remember.

She added: 'I was raised by my mother and our family never had much money. I was teased by the other kids for wearing hand-me-downs.'

Early days: Frankii when she was six-years-old was subjected to daily physical and verbal abuse for years and even threatened with a knife

Then and now: Frankii pictured left, at school where the bullying escalated, and, right, now becoming a top pin-up model

The bullying escalated when Frankii began attending Sedgefield Community College in County Durham at the age of eleven.

She explains: 'When I started secondary school, things took a turn for the worse and the other kids would call me 'ugly' and 'fat'.

'I would get food thrown at me in the canteen on a daily basis. Break times were the worst. It got to the point where I would hide in the school building, instead of going outside, so I wouldn't have to face the bullies.

'They would play some horrible pranks on me such as sending me fake Valentine's Day cards from boys I had a crush on. I would be excited, but then discover it was from the kids who were tormenting me at school.'

'They would also create new email addresses and send abusive messages to me.'

Frankii explained: 'When I turned fifteen, the bullies threatened me with a knife on the school run. I was so traumatised and scared. 

'I can't even describe how much I hated school then. It didn't matter what I did, I couldn't escape the horrendous bullying.

'I became depressed and started seeing a councilor. I was also self-harming and regularly contemplated taking my own life.'

Turnaround: In college, Frankii started experimenting with the 1940s and 50s look and began receiving complements for her looks

'My mother was beside herself about what I was happening. She was always down at school or on the phone, trying to sort things out. But there was nothing she could do.

In spite of the abuse that was thrown at her every day, Frankii excelled in Art and Design. She was thrilled when she was awarded a bursary to study A-Level photography at Cleveland College of Art and Design in Linthorpe, Middleborough.

Finally leaving her high school oppressors in behind, Frankii thrived in college. It was around this time that she started experimenting with the 1940s and 50s look and began receiving complements for her looks.

'During our photography classes, we used to model for each other and my tutor was forever saying I had great bone structure.'

Naked truth: In spite of the abuse that was leveled at her in class every day, Frankii excelled in Art and Design

'I pretty much dismissed it because I had a very low opinion of myself, as people had always been so cruel about the way I had looked.

'Bullying conditions you to regard yourself in a certain way and to this day, I still struggle with negative thoughts.

'However, I began putting some self-portraits on my Myspace page. Photographers as well as a local modeling agency contacted me requesting that I pop along to a casting day.'

'The agency put me on their books and I was soon being paid for my first shoot. I was a little worried that the photographer would think I was ugly or not good enough. But I ended up getting repeat bookings.'

New fans: Frankii's modelling career has aken off and now she has 24,000 followers across social media

Frankii's modeling career quickly took off and her stunning, distinctive looks have kept her working for the last decade. She also runs her own photography business called 'Frankii & Gerry's Retro Photo & Film Studio' business with Glamour Bunny founder, Gerry Roxby.

She says: 'Not in a million years did I ever think this would happen to me. I've modeled for countless lingerie, fashion and make-up brands.

'I have almost 24,000 followers across all social media. I'm so grateful to my fans, they're so lovely and positive.

'I run a great business too and have a wonderful boyfriend, Tom. I try to remember that all of that past bullying doesn't matter anymore.'

Inspiration: Frankii hopes that her story inspires and helps other victims of bullying

Due to her success, Frankii often receives messages from the school bullies that made her life a misery and now even want to befriend her.

'I reckon they think I'm some sort of celebrity now. A few of the bullies have messaged me on Facebook saying things like 'Wow you look amazing, I can't believe how well you're doing now!' or 'Wow, haven't you changed since school!'

'It's very positive but I'm a bit shocked that they try to contact me after what they did. No-one has ever said sorry. I usually reply with a brief 'Thanks' and try to move on.'

Frankii hopes that her story inspires and helps other victims of bullying.

'I want to tell other kids who are being bullied that it gets better. Hang in there and use that hate for good. Use that hate as rocket fuel for your life.'
