Real Madrid forwards Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema have not suffered serious injuries and should be fit for next Saturday's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid, coach Carlo Ancelotti said.

Alarm bells rang after Ronaldo, Real's top scorer, apparently hurt himself in the warm-up before Saturday's La Liga game, a 3-1 win against Espanyol, but Ancelotti said it was nothing to be concerned about and the Portugal captain had merely been rested as a precaution.

Benzema limped out of the match with 
just over 20 minutes remaining with what Ancelotti described as a twinge
 in his adductor muscle.

Gareth Bale put Real ahead just after the hour mark before an Alvaro Morata double either side of a Pizzi strike for Esapanyol to hand Ancelotti's men.

'Cristiano wasn't comfortable in the warm-up and we decided not to take any risks,' the Italian told a news conference.

'We are not worried because we think he can play the (Champions League) final,' he added.

'Benzema had a twinge in the adductor and he shouldn't have any problem in playing the final.'

Ancelotti
 said centre back Pepe, who has been suffering with a calf problem, was 
recovering well and the club were confident he could play against 
Atletico.

Duo: Real Madrid will be hoping they can still start their two stars in next Saturday's Champions League Final

Hope: And the Portuguese captain will be hoping it's not so serious that he misses the World Cup
