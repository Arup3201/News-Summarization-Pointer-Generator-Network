Last July, Eugene Han and Kirstin Davis found themselves cowering in terror under their seats in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater as a crazed gunman was spraying bullets into the audience.

On Saturday, a year to the day after the deadly attack, the happy couple got married in a small church just 3 miles from the cinema where they had nearly perished. 

Han, 21, and Davis, 22, were among the 58 injured in the shooting that left a dozen dead. Friends who also survived the rampage took part in the ceremony at Village East Baptist Church in Aurora as senior pastor Robert McClendon prayed for the couple and for those still grieving.

United: Aurora shooting survivors, and now newlyweds, Eugene and Kirstin Han smile at each other after exchanging vows during their wedding ceremony at Village East Baptist Church, in Aurora, Colo.

Sealed with a kiss: Three months after Han popped the question to his girlfriend on a beach during a romantic getaway, the two exchanged vows and rings in Aurora, where the two had first met

Reclaim the date: The happy couple chose July 20 as their wedding day in a bid to transform a tragic anniversary into a day of celebration

‘This time is both happy and sacred,’ McClendon said.

The visibly emotional bride entered the church Saturday afternoon on the arm of her father, Darrell, who walked her down the aisle, decorated with tulle and turquoise ribbons, wearing a black cowboy hat.

At the altar, the blushing bride was met by her groom, who opted for a classic black suit paired with a white vest and tie. A boutonniere of white and blue flowers pinned to his lapel completed Han’s wedding day look.

Kirstin Davis appeared radiant in her A-line, dropped-waistline satin gown with a sweetheart bodice heavily embellished with crystals and a full skirt with cascading pickups and a large brooch sparkling in the back.

Photos taken during the ceremony show the emotional and elated couple exchanging vows and sealing their union with a kiss, flanked by their wedding party and family.

One of Davis' bridesmaids, attired in a turquoise halter dress, also survived the massacre, along with two of Han’s groomsmen.

Han and Davis’ journey that brought them to this joyous day started on South Padre Island on the last day of an April vacation.

As the sun rose over the beach Eugene asked Kirstin if she would be his wife - and she said yes.

He followed with another idea: They should be married on July 20, 2013. 

‘It took me a second. I didn't understand where he was coming from,’ Davis said.

Their wedding would take place a year to the day that they went to the Century 16 theater.

That night, the couple, who had been dating for two years, had settled into the second row near the aisle alongside three friends, among them Adan Avila and Luke Priest, to watch the premiere of the thriller The Dark Knight Rises.

Han, sleepy from a 12-hour shift at a medical supply business, spotted someone dressed all in black entering through an exit door near the screen. He saw that two guns were strapped to the intruder's body, and he dropped from his seat and pulled Davis to the floor:

‘All I was thinking was, if anything, I could put myself between her and the bullets,’ he recalled.

Both were injured. He was shot at close range in his hip and leg and had to undergo several surgeries. Davis had bullet fragments in her back. His friend Adan Avila also was shot in the leg, which had to be amputated, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Han spent five days at a hospital and the next three months bedridden, his parents and brother tending to him. A year later, his right leg is marked by purplish, coin-size scars.

About a month after the shootings, 
Davis started a job as a teaching assistant at an elementary school. 
Then came the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn., 
which ‘sent me over the edge.’ She eventually quit her job.

These
 days, she is sleeping better, but she fears big crowds. Someday, the 
22-year-old Davis sees herself once again working with children.

Healing: A year later, Han's right leg is marked by purplish, coin-size scars.

Believers: They credited their spiritual faith with allowing them to find forgiveness for the gunman

Haunted: Kirstin is sleeping better now, but she fears big crowds

Han, 21, wants to return to college, write a book - and let the shooter know he forgives him.

Han explained prior to the ceremony that the idea behind their decision to tie the knot on July 20 was to make it a happy day, at least for them.

‘Someone has to be the first person to take the first step to make it a better day,’ Han said.

In January, Han and Davis visited the newly remodel Century 16 multiplex along with other shooting victims.

Han and his parents walked inside what used to be theater 9 and sat in the second row, thinking about their lucky escape. Davis walked right out the room, and the couple have not returned to that cinema since.

The childhood friends met in church in the fourth grade and began dating three years ago.

On the night of the shooting, Han, Davis and three friends decided to attend the midnight showing of the new Batman movie.

Survivors: Eugene Han and Kirstin Davis have been together for three years

Han, 21, and Davis, 22, were among the 58 
people wounded when alleged shooter James Holmes opened fire 18 minutes 
into the screening of the new Batman film on July 20, 2012.

Han was shot in the knee and hip in the attack, and Davis suffered scratches after her boyfriend pushed her to safety.

Mr Han said he thought he was going to be killed as soon as the shooting began. He still has bullet fragments inside his body.

Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder and attempted murder, 
and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes's lawyers say he 
wants to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

If the judge accepts the new plea, 
Holmes would be sent to the state mental hospital, where doctors would 
determine whether he was insane at the time of the July 20 shootings.

Holmes was 24 when he carried out his
 attack in the packed movie theater. He had recently dropped out of his 
PhD in neuroscience at the University of Colorado in Denver and had been
 seeing a university psychologist.

Witnesses
 said that about 20 minutes into the film a man wearing a gas mask and 
bullet-proof vest walked into the theater and started firing into the 
crowd.

As the audience 
tried to run for cover, the gunman was said to have continued to fire 
calmly into the crowd with an assault rifle, handgun and shotgun.

His youngest victim was six-year-old Veronica Moser, whose 25-year-old mother was seriously injured in the shooting.

The former student had also allegedly left explosive devices at his home

The childhood friends have vowed to not let the attack, which killed 12 people, ruin their future lives together.

Mr Han told Denver Channel: 'Most days I remember it like it was yesterday. Why not make it a better day?'

'We were talking about that word "anniversary". Honestly, I don't think it should be used for the theater
 shooting. It's not a good day,' Mr Han told the station.

Investigation: Police search the suspected gunman's car outside the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado
