Dos Equis' 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' was once a 'surprise guest' at a birthday party for President Barack Obama, the actor featured in the popular commercials revealed on Thursday.

Asked during on a reddit forum who the most interesting man in the world is that he's met, actor Jonathan Goldsmith tossed out the president's name and recounted the time he spent a day and a half with the Commander in Chief at Camp David several years ago.

'He had brought out 10 of his dear friends going all the way back to Grade School, I felt very honored and privileged to be there,' Goldsmith said.

Actor Jonathan Goldsmith, best known as Dos Equis' 'Most Interesting Man in the World,' said Thursday that the most interesting man he's met is the President Barack Obama, whose birthday party he once attended as a 'surprise guest'

'I will report that the President is a very good marksman, contrary to frequently held opinions,' Goldsmith said, defending Obama, whose shooting ability became the butt of jokes last year after the White House released this picture of him last year

'We talked. And he was sharing a lot of stories with his dear friends, going back to some of the early years of school, to as far back as grad school. and I was very glad to be there, it was a lot of fun,'he noted.

Goldsmith did not say when his rendezvous with the president and his pals took place, but it may have occurred during the first year Obama was in office. 

That summer the first lady held a surprise party for her husband at the presidential retreat in Frederick County, Maryland, to celebrate his forty-eighth birthday.

The exclusive party was reportedly attended by longtime friends of the president from Chicago and Hawaii.

Obama has spent three other birthday weekends at Camp David, including one following his most recent birthday last month. The president used the government operated getaway spot as his birthday party venue in 2012 and 2013, as well.

Goldsmith told redditors on Thursday that the year he attended the president's birthday bash, guests competed in archery, went bowling and shot skeet.

'I will report that the President is a very good marksman, contrary to frequently held opinions,' Goldsmith said, defending Obama, whose shooting ability became the butt of jokes last year after he claimed he shot skeet 'all the time' at Camp David.

The White House then released a photo of Obama shooting a shot gun while wearing protective glasses and ear muffs to prove that the president, who has aggressively worked to place sharper restrictions on gun sales, does in fact know how to shoot a firearm.

Goldsmith said Obama and his friends also played basketball during the special visit, though the actor said he personally sat those festivities out.

'My basketball playing days are a little behind me and I didn't want to embarrass myself with these kids,' he admitted. 

Goldsmith was so taken with Obama that in the fall of 2012 he hosted a fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign.

The move angered some Dos Equis drinkers, Advertising Age noted at the time, who consider Goldsmith and the character he plays in the TV commercials to be one in the same.
