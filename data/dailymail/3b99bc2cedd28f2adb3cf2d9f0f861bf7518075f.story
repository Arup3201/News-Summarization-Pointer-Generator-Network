While England struggle to qualify from their group at the Brazil World Cup, forgotten man Michael Carrick is sunning himself on a beach in Barbados.

The Manchester United midfielder was overlooked from Roy Hodgson's squad, with former teammate Rio Ferdinand claiming he paid the price for David Moyes' disastrous season at Old Trafford.

'It’s a real shame for 
Carrick that one side-effect was losing his place on the greatest 
stage. He was downbeat about the news — and I know because I was with 
him when he got the call to say he wasn’t going. Nemanja Vidic and I 
took him to the pub for a consolation drink,' said Ferdinand.

Forgotten man: Michael Carrick was overlooked for Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup

Sportsmail columnist Adrian Durham claims that the cultured passer could have been England's answer to Andrea Pirlo at the World Cup.

The 35-year-old Italian was typically influential during their 2-1 opening defeat of England in Manaus, with Durham claiming the country needn't be so obsessed with the playmaker when we have a player in the same mould.

'The sad thing is English football did 
produce a Pirlo. His name is Michael Carrick and after being left out of
 Roy Hodgson’s squad this summer he will end his career having played in
 just one game at a World Cup finals. We won it 1-0,' Durham wrote in his column.

'I
 don’t know if Carrick would have had as good an international career as
 Pirlo, but I do know the job he did in a very successful Manchester 
United side under Sir Alex Ferguson for many seasons.

'All these England managers felt they knew better than Sir Alex. They all failed. 

'It’s
 all about opinions, and I’d probably conclude Pirlo is a better player 
than Carrick. But if England had used him in their midfield instead of 
messing around trying to use Lampard and Gerrard together, we may have 
been more successful. Anyone scoffing at this can’t prove me wrong. 

'If
 you love Pirlo, you’ll appreciate what Carrick has done for United all 
these years. If you can’t see the connection, then English football’s 
problems run worryingly deep.'
