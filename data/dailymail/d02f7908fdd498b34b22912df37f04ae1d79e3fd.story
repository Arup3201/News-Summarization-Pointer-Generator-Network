A state doctor has claimed that the mental condition of a 12-year-old girl accused of brutally stabbing a classmate to impress Slender Man has improved and she is fit to stand trial.

Morgan Geyser was ordered to undergo mental health treatment in August after a psychologist testified that she was not fit to stand trial, claiming she saw and heard unicorns, Slender Man and Harry Potter's Voldemort.

The girl, who had previously appeared disheveled and often rocked back and forth in court, looked more alert and had her hair back from her face during Wednesday's brief hearing.

She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old classmate 19 times with another friend, Anissa Weier, after they lured her into the woods in Waukesha following a sleepover on May 30.

Fit to stand: Morgan Geyser, pictured in court in June, has been deemed fit to stand trial by a doctor. She is accused of stabbing a 12-year-old friend 19 times in May and leaving her for dead

On Wednesday, Judge Michael Bohren summarized the doctor's report, but he didn't act on it after defense attorney Anthony Cotton said he hadn't had a chance to discuss it with his client.

Bohren told Cotton to talk to the girl and come back to court next Tuesday.  

Cotton, who declined comment after the hearing, had previously expressed concern about the girl's mental health and advocated for treatment. 

Court documents allege that the two girls had plotted to kill their classmate in an effort to curry favor with the fictional character Slender Man.

The victim, Payton Leutner, who identified herself to ABC's 20/20 in September, was lured into the woods and stabbed in the chest, abdomen, legs and arms, allegedly by her two friends.

Police revealed the girls had been plotting the attack for five months and initially intended to murder Payton in her sleep at Morgan's house but backed out at the last minute.

They changed their plans and decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down.

When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband.

They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees.

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times.

Geyser told investigators she stabbed the victim multiple times, according to a criminal complaint. 

Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911.

The victim spent six days in the hospital.

Doctors later told police the knife missed a major artery near her heart by a millimeter.

The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

Weier, who is now 13, has a competency hearing next month. She was initially found competent to stand trial but her attorneys objected to the findings.

They have both been charged as adults with first-degree attempted homicide. 

Wisconsin law requires attempted murder cases with suspects from 10 and older to start in adult court before attorneys can ask a judge to move it to juvenile court.

If they are convicted as adults, they could be sentenced up to 60 years in prison. If they are convicted as juveniles, they could be held until they are 25.
