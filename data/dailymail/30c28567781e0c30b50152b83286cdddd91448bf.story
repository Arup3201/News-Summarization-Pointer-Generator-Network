A North Korean comedian was sent to do hard labour in a coal mine midway through her performance after she made a ‘slip of the tongue’ about the country's draconian regime.

Lee Choon Hong, a popular comedian known for satirising and mimicking people in North Korean society, was performing for workers on a vast farm project ordered by leader Kim Jong Un when she commented on 'sensitive issues', it was reported.

The comedian was immediately taken off and sent to the Jikdong Youth Coal Mine, without even having a chance to say goodbye to her family, according to local reports in the notoriously secret country.

It is not known how long Lee will be held for, but a typical punishment is likely to involve a six-month evaluation period during which she would be observed at work in the mine before a decision to release her was made.

Lee, who had been ordered by authorities to entertain the workers on a 150,000-acre pastureland farm project in Sep'o in Kangwondo Province, was doing her act when she made what was described as a 'sensitive comment'.

A source told Radio Free Asia: 'She had a slip of the tongue while giving a performance for the workers at the Sepo reclamation project site'.

They added: 'She was sent straight to the city of Sunchon in South Pyongan province to carry out reform work at the Jikdong Youth Coal Mine', and said she had had to postpone her daughter's wedding as a result.

What the comedian said has not been reported, but it is said to be the second time she has upset authorities in North Korea - she was reportedly sent to do reform work in the mid-2000s after 'misspeaking'.

Lee, who is known for being talented at impersonating people's voices, frequently performed for the late dictator Kim Jong Il, and was chosen to join his Entourage Of Delight in the 1980s.

Life under the regime of the diminutive dictator with big ambitions is tough and regimented, and anyone stepping out of line can expect to be punished.
