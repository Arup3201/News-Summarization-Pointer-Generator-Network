A golf course and spa is trying to put off undesirable visitors with a sign saying ‘No Riff Raff’ allowed.

The owners of Cedar Falls Spa and Golf Course in Bishop’s Lydeard, near Taunton in Somerset, insist the sign is ‘tongue in cheek’ - but some visitors have claimed that it is inappropriate.

One critic took to Tripadvisor to critics the sign, saying: ‘Riff Raff? You cannot be serious?’

Stormfever, a woman travel writer, said: ‘The sign outside, which reads “No Riff Raff” - honestly it does - should make you think twice about Cedar Falls. Are you welcome? Are you sure?

‘How do you know if you're Riff Raff? If you’re 80 per cent posh and 20 per cent ordinary, might you be verging on riff-raffery without even knowing? Don’t worry. The prices will keep out the “riff raff”.’

And a local resident, who did not wish to be named, said people should not be placed in categories.

Richard Smith, manager of the venue, said: ‘The sign is in fun but the spa does have standards. Anyone who does visit the centre must behave in a reasonable manner.

‘Absolutely no harm is meant by the sign and people really need to lighten up a little bit.’ He added that no-one has ever been turned away from the centre for falling into the category of ‘riff raff’.

Cedar Falls Health Farm & Spa is based among 44 acres of grounds and has a 17th century 32-bedroom red stone mansion, with rooms costing up to £240 per night.
