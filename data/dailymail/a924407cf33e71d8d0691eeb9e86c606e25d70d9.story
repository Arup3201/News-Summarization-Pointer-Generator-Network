With just four days until Christmas, crowds gathered under the arches of Wells Cathedral for one of the longest-running carol services in the country.

According to the church's archives, the choir has been marking occassions such as Christmas since 909 AD.

The 36 choristers - 18 boys and 18 girls - go through meticulous trials, train habitually, and tour internationally.

Hundreds came together last night under the 'scissor arches' of Wells Cathedral lit just by candlelight to watch the 36 choristers mark Christmas

The boys and girls sang with older members of the cathedral's singing groups

For the carol service, they are joined by the Vicars Choral, nine professional singers and vicars in the cathedral.

The candlelight affair, conducted by Matthew Owens and accompanied by Jonathan Vaughn on the organ, took place under the scissor arches in the main hall.

Though many believe them to be modern additions, the ecclesiastical arches were built in 1348 as a quick fix for the spire which was beginning to show cracks.

The choir in Somerset dates back to 909 AD and has survived through the 1104 years

The members go through meticulous trials and train habitually, before performing in numerous concerts and touring the world

Architects tried many different 
techniques to strengthen the building internally, until the famous 
â€˜scissor archesâ€™ were constructed by William Joy in a last ditch 
attempt.

The cathedral is also home to The Jesse Window, a 1340 stained glass window that charts the ancestors of Christ in what is believed to be the first ever family tree.

Positioned across the entire eastern wall of the choir, the window narrowly escaped destruction in the English Civil War and World War II.

The choir will perform again tonight and on Monday 23.

The groups, which will perform again tonight and on Monday for churchgoers, were positioned at either end of the hall

The grand cathedral is also home to the Jesse Window, a portrayal of Christ's ancestors which is thought to be the first ever family tree.
