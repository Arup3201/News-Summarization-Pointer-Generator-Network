The sun has been shining on the muddy fields of Worthy Farm as festival revellers enjoyed a final day of music and debauchery at Glastonbury.

Country queen Dolly Parton wore the crown during the famous 'Sunday afternoon legend's slot' as she took to the Pyramid stage at 4pm.

But behind the scenes at Glastonbury, it is a slightly different story, where volunteers are wading through mountains of rubbish bags fit to burst, already up to their necks in the clean-up in a bid to protect the fields from yet more damage.

Mountains of waste: This is just a fraction of the rubbish at Glastonbury in the morning of the third and final day, which volunteers must now wade through

Hold your breath: Covering their noses with face masks, the litter pickers made an early dent in the piles of rubbish, which will take days to shift

Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset, has been marred by torrential rain - and the trampling of 175,000 revellers - this weekend.

Transformed into a mudbath by day one, the plains took a battering last night as crowds descended from their camp sites for Metallica's explosive set.

It followed performances from Lana Del Rey, MIA, Haim and Lily Allen.

After last night's heavy metal, the next act to grace the venue were dancers from the English National Ballet this morning, ahead of Dolly Parton's set on the Pyramid Stage at 4pm, commonly known as the 'Sunday afternoon legend's slot'.

Excitement had been building ahead of 
the Jolene singer's performance, with a flash mob or 'Dolly mob' as it 
has been called, planned for the morning along with a singalongaDoll.

The rubbish is deep but spirits are high: Excitement was brewing on Worthy Farm in Somerset this morning ahead of Dolly Parton's set on the Pyramid Stage

Mammoth task: The six-week clean-up will require the help of thousands as the Eavis family, who run the farm, aim to separate all recyclable goods from waste

Many fans were paying homage to the star today with specially-made T-shirts and fancy dress outfits.

Speaking ahead of her set, the Jolene singer said: ‘I'm just a country girl and now I feel like a rock star.'

Dolly was speaking as she was presented with an award backstage at the festival in recognition of her having sold 100 million records worldwide.

Parton said she planned to play some of her more upbeat tracks from her extensive back catalogue.

‘I can't do a bunch of sad songs because everyone is drunk and high,’ she added.

Parton said was ‘excited’ about playing the festival and could not believe she had never appeared before.

As promised, Parton appeared in white, dressed in a skintight jumpsuit and huge heels, saying previously that the colour went well with the brown mud.

Woops! Alva Hallerstrom, 21, who travelled over from Stockholm in Sweden for the event, took a tumble in the mud, falling flat on her face

Viking-style celebrations: That is going to be an effort to clean later as the sun is starting to dry the mud - but Alva seems more than content continuing like this

Unrecognisable: The once-green fields have been battered by torrential rain and the trampling of 175,000 revellers, transforming it into a mud bath

Swamped: Festival-goers are today hoping for sunnier skies and less rain after days of relentless wind and showers that have swamped the grounds

Binned: Thankfully the sun is out as these mud-caked umbrellas are completely destroyed. This poor reveller seems to be heading home just as the weather perks up

Murky: Three girls walk across what was once a luscious green field. Forecasters said the dry weeks before the rain made the mud situation even worse

As the crowd cheered, she told them: 
‘Thank you so much. It is such an honour and such a thrill to be here at
 Glastonbury Festival.

‘I've been waiting a lifetime for this and of course we want all of you to have the best time.

‘I know you're here to see a whole load of artists at the festival and we're just glad that you came to see me.’

The 68-year-old star has been the most talked about act of the festival, following other artists including Ray Davies, Shirley Bassey and James Brown.

Kasabian
 will headline the stage later while other acts sure to make sure 
Glastonbury goes out with a bang include the Black Keys, Massive Attack 
and Bombay Bicycle Club.

Legend: Country singer Dolly Parton took to the Pyramid Stage in a white sequined number for the so-called Sunday Afternoon Legend slot

Dolly mob: Bounding around the stage, she belted out hits including Jolene and 9-5 as people in the crowds wearing Dolly wigs performed a flash mob

Queen of glam: Dolly Parton entertained the crowd with her greatest hits, including Jolene and 9 to 5

Dollywood: The crowd packed themselves to watch the 68-year-old, one of the most talked about acts of the Glastonbury festival

Cheeky: The 68-year-old Jolene singer said she would not be singing her sad songs such as I Will Always Love You, 'because everyone is drunk and high'

Brave choice: Ahead of her performance Dolly said she had chosen the white outfit as it would go well with the brown mud

After two days of stop-start showers, many festival-goers will be hoping for a drier finale as previously promised.

Temperatures are set to reach 19C, with cloudy skies but only a very slim chance of rain.

Incredibly,
 the bookies are already looking ahead to next year's festival and make 
it long odds-on at 1/3 tickets sell out faster than they ever have 
before.

And looking ahead to
 potential headliners it's Fleetwood Mac (5/1) who lead the way to take 
to the Pyramid Stage, Kanye West is also fancied at 8/1 or it's a 10/1 
shot Kate Bush gets the bug for performing again following her temporary
 residency at Hammersmith Apollo this year.

Coldplay could headline for the third time at odds of 10/1 or Prince could finally take to the stage at 12/1. 

However, the good news is that Worthy 
Farm is unlikely to be filled with 1D fans next year with their beloved 
One Direction chalked up as 100/1 outsiders.

Unusual: Kicking off the final day, the English National Ballet made its Glastonbury debut with Dust by Akram Khan, warming the Pyramid Stage for Dolly

Jessica
 Bridge of Ladbrokes said: 'The rain might have tried to dampen spirits 
this year but it certainly won't stop festival goers from purchasing 
tickets in record time for 2015.'

She
 added: 'It's quickly becoming a case of when and not if Fleetwood Mac 
headline. Michael Eavis likes to push the boundaries and we reckon Kanye
 and Kardashians will be rocking up to Worthy Farm next year.'

The festivities were tinged with drama
 last night as it emerged woman has been airlifted to hospital from the 
site after suffering spinal injuries.

The reveller, who has not been named, was taken to Southmead Hospital, in Bristol, at around 5pm.

It
 is unknown how she came about her injuries but Dorset and Somerset Air 
Ambulance confirmed the woman needed off-site attention.

It
 is not thought a 999 call was made and instead the festival's medical 
services were the first to treat her before calling for help from the 
Air Ambulance, on Saturday.
