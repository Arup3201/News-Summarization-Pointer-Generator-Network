A brother has spoken of the moment a seaside adventure turned to tragedy and his regrets at  leaving his sister trapped in a water-filled cave while he tried to get help.

Charlotte Furness-Smith, 30, died after she and her brother Alex were swept into the cave as they spent a day climbing sea cliffs.

The terrified former Royal Navy Reserve screamed ‘Get me out of here’, as rescuers spent two hours trying to reach her.

Her brother tried to summon help on his mobile phone but couldn’t get a signal. The 31-year-old decided to leave his sister, who was known as Buffy, while he dived underwater and swam out to get help.

He told the inquest into his sister’s death yesterday: ‘Buffy was a bit scared but we talked and she calmed down. I told her it would be OK.

‘After a while it became apparent we could not keep being battered by the waves.

‘We had a mobile phone with us in a waterproof bag so we tried to dial 999 but there was no reception. We looked to swim out of the cave but every time we saw an opportunity another big wave came crashing in.

‘It appeared the only option was for one of us to swim outside to get help.

‘I decided to swim out of the cave. Buffy wanted to go with me. She said she could not bear not knowing if something had happened to me.

By the time he entered the cave at cliffs near Swanage, Charlotte had drowned, the inquest heard

He described the moment he found her body after being lowered down the 15ft hole just wide enough for him

‘I said that she should be able to see me going out and if I did get into danger she would have a second chance of getting out. I asked her to stay put. I thought that was the safest thing to do.’

Coastguards and lifeboat crews were unable to reach Miss  Furness-Smith because of the severe conditions and spoke to her through a blowhole in the top of the cave.

The inquest heard coastguard Ian Bugler risked his life by being lowered down the narrow hole.

But by the time he entered the cave at cliffs near Swanage,  Dorset, she had drowned. Her body has never been recovered.

Mr Furness-Smith was plucked out of the sea by a coastguard helicopter at 3pm on November 2 last year, while a lifeboat crew tried to reach the entrance to  the cave but was beaten back by the waves.

Andrew Bugler, station officer for St Albans Coastguard, was part of the team who attempted the rescue.

Rescue attempt: Her brother, Alex, left her trapped in the cave while he called for the Coastguard. They rushed to the scene, but could not save her in time

He said: ‘They were shouting down every three to four minutes. I could hear her screaming back, “Get me out of here”. She sounded terrified.’

Russell Thompson, an expert in coasteering who runs guided tours along the Dorset coast, told the inquest that conditions on November 2 were too dangerous to consider going in the water.

He said: ‘We would have never have even thought about getting into the water that day.’

Miss Furness-Smith, a maths teacher from Bristol, had travelled to the Dorset coast with her brother to go kite-surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering at Tilly Whim Caves near Swanage.

They put on wetsuits, buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped in at 1.30pm.

As they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by gale-force winds and were swept into it.

Charlotte Furness-Smith's mother, Patricia, arrived at Bournemouth Coroner's Court to hear the evidence

Part-way through, Miss Furness-Smith's mother and father, Charles, branded the proceedings 'a charade'

Part way through the inquest in Bournemouth yesterday, Miss Furness-Smith’s parents,  Patricia, 57, and Charles, 58, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, branded the proceedings  ‘a charade’.

They appeared to be unhappy that certain witnesses they wanted to ask questions of were not at the inquest, although it was not made clear who they were referring to.

The inquest continues.

Aftermath: In the hours after the horrifying incident, rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet. Today, Alex, 31, told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave

Tide: A lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves. One rescuer was lowered down into the cave, but Charlotte was already dead

Adrian Rogers, helicopter paramedic winchman, was also in attendance to hear the accounts of what happened
