The family of a 4-year-old Massachusetts boy killed in an escalator accident at a mall has reached a settlement in a negligence lawsuit.

Mark DiBona of Dudley fell from a second-floor escalator about 18 feet onto a display case below inside a department store at the Auburn Mall in March 2011 while shopping with family.

He suffered head injuries and died the next day.

His parents sued the mall's owner, the store, the escalator's manufacture and the contractor that installed it, alleging the escalator was in 'dangerous and defective' condition.

Tragedy: The family of 4-year-old Mark DiBona have reached an $11.5 million settlement in a lawsuit after their son died after falling from a Massachusetts department store escalator

Laura and Mark: The lawsuit was settled earlier this year and although the terms are confidential, a lawyer magazine has revealed the settlement was for $11.5 million

Public Safety Commissioner Thomas E. 
Gatzunis said the state officials 'failed to properly inspect the unit' 
 and left it in an unsafe condition.

A
 barricade that should have been between the side of the escalator and 
the wall was missing creating a gap 'larger than allowed by code.'

The tragic boy was shopping with his 
family and a friend when he rushed towards the escalators on the second 
floor of the Sears department store.

He grabbed the moving rail with both hands but was dragged through the small gap between the escalator and Plexiglas barrier.

Mr Gatzunis added: 'The code requires a barricade for openings over five inches. This opening was six and a quarter inches.’

A lawyer for the boy's parents, Laura and Eric DiBona, tells The Telegram & Gazette that the lawsuit was settled earlier this year but said terms were confidential.

'The family can never get over this, but it does end this chapter,' said the family's lawyer, W. Thomas Smith of the Boston law firm Sugarman and Sugarman. 'It resolves the legal matter, which was important to the family.'

Massachusetts Lawyer's Weekly reported in Monday's edition that Mr. Smith and his associate, Stacey L. Pietrowicz, who also worked on the suit, were the lawyers in an $11.5 million settlement involving a boy who suffered a fatal head injury in a fall from a mall escalator.

Mr. Smith said the out-of-court settlement was agreed on within the last two months. He declined to reveal the terms of the confidential agreement.

The death led to a crackdown on escalator safety across the state.

Scene: The horrific incident happened at Auburn Mall in Worcester, Massachusetts, where the child's family and a friend had been shopping

Lessons learned:After the accident, the state also re-inspected the state's 927 escalators and found that 69 lacked barricades and others were missing top or bottom barricades

A spokesman for Sears, Howard Riefs, said in an email: 'Sears is pleased that Schindler Elevator Company, one of the largest and most highly respected escalator companies in the United States, which was responsible for installing and maintaining the escalators at its Auburn store, has now reached a settlement with the DiBona family.'

'We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the DiBona family and are pleased that this matter has been resolved,' the statement added.

The boy's death sparked a crackdown by state public safety officials, including the firing of two escalator inspectors and the disciplining of nearly two-thirds of the state's escalator inspectors for failing to catch similar code violations.

After the accident, the state also re-inspected the state's 927 escalators and found that 69 lacked barricades and others were missing top or bottom barricades.
