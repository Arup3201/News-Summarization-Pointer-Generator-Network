Britain's bosses are crippling their workers with the worst-ever pay rises, official figures revealed yesterday.

The Office for National Statistics said the average worker is getting a pay rise of just one per cent, the lowest pay rise since its records began in 2001.

With the cost of living rising at 2.8 per cent, it means a worker’s pay is barely rising while their bills are rising at a rate which is nearly three times higher.

Record lows: The average worker has seen their wage increase a mere one per cent while living costs have increased by 2.8 per cent

Since the financial crisis began in 2008, the ONS said there have been just three months when wages have risen faster than the consumer prices index measure of inflation.

Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, warned: ‘Employees are seeing a substantial erosion of their spending power as salaries fail to keep pace with price growth.’

He said it was ‘baffling in an age of supposed pay restraint’ that public sector pay is rising by an average of 1.6 per cent, compared to one per cent for private sector workers.

Unsustainable: Bills are bulging at a rate nearly three times higher than wages are rising

Household bills from the cost of keeping their home warm to the bill for filling up their car with petrol are going up, but workers have little or no extra cash to cover the cost.

It comes after inflation has been above the Government’s target of two per cent for more three years amid warnings that the cost of living will continue to rise sharply.

Other bills from food to council tax, university tuition fees to childcare costs are rising, but workers are not being given a decent pay rise each year to allow their wages to keep up.

There is also pressure from the increase in VAT to 20 per cent, the loss or cut in child benefit for more than one million families and changes to tax credits.

Overall, the ONS said recently the average annual increase for the whole of the last decade was just 1.3 per cent, the lowest figure since records began in 1948.

A typical man in the private sector is earning less than he was being paid a decade ago after the figures have been adjusted for inflation.

In 2002, a typical man with a full-time job in the private sector earned £12.67 per hour. A decade later, he is earning 30p less per hour.
