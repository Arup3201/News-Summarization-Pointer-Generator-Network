Manchester City will be without Samir Nasri for at least a month when the France international has an operation on his groin next week.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini said on Friday that Nasri has been struggling to train and will now miss matches against Hull, Aston Villa, Tottenham and West Ham in the  Premier League, as well as Champions League fixtures against Roma and CSKA Moscow.

Pellegrini said: ‘It’s serious because he will have surgery in the next days. I’m not a doctor but he will be out for around one month.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini confirmed that Nasri was advised to have the operation by the club's doctors 

The Frenchman scored some crucial goals last season but has missed City's last two matches through injury

‘He was training but he wasn’t 100 per cent and he wasn’t comfortable with what he was doing so the doctor decided it was the best option.’

Pellegrini, whose side face Hull on Saturday, says the club could extend Frank Lampard’s loan from New York City FC beyond January.

‘The possibility is to do the best for Manchester City,’ Pellegrini said.

Pellegrini also said on Friday that Frank Lampard could stay at the Etihad Stadium beyond January
