England’s players look like they are dressed for a wet and windy night in Bolton but there’s method in the madness as Roy Hodgson’s charges prepare for the heat and humidity of Brazil.

The players wore several layers of warm clothing as they trained here in Portugal while Hodgson’s sports science team monitored their body temperatures.

Sports scientists from Loughborough University have flown out to take samples of the players’ sweat as they prepare for the humid conditions of Manaus, where England play Italy on June 14 in their first Group D game.

They are working with the Arsenal 
nutritionist James Collins who has previously prepared British Olympic 
teams and monitors their diet and food supplements as well as 
electrolyte recovery and matchday preparation.

Hodgson
 said: ‘Up to now the work has been very sports  science and fitness 
orientated. They are being analysed in terms of the extra heat we tried 
to generate and it is part of our process which [sports scientist] Dave 
Reddin and his team have started.’

England’s
 players were introduced to team psychiatrist Steve Peters on Tuesday 
for the first time since he was appointed by the FA. Hodgson said: ‘I 
asked him to present himself to us and he did that in a very 
entertaining and informative way. The players were very attentive. 
Sitting behind them watching them listen suggested they were interested.

‘He
 is an entertaining man. He just told us all the things he’s done in 
life. It’s quite amazing. I don’t know how old he is but to do all the 
things he’s done he must be about 150.’

Master mind: Manager Hodgson talks to the players during the training session

Putting it into practice: Hodgson gave his players a demonstration during the session in Portugal

Hodgson
 delivered a post-training pep talk to his young players on Wednesday, 
telling them they must take their chance at this World Cup.

Hodgson
 pointedly took Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley aside for 
individual conversations lasting  several minutes at the end of their 
hour-long session. Shaw (18), Sterling (19) and Barkley (20) are the 
youngest members of the squad and he was keen to stress that they are 
heading to the World Cup on merit.

Sterling
 was the outstanding player during on Wednesday's open training session,
 but Hodgson wants to make sure the young England players are fully 
prepared.The head coach said: ‘They should be pleased they are here, but
 they shouldn’t feel overawed by the occasion because they have done 
well and deserve their place.

‘It
 was just to tell them they are here on merit. I haven’t detected any 
nerves at all. There was a feeling of relief because they realised this 
year my choice wasn’t easy.

‘There
 has been a great feeling of enthusiasm and let’s get started on this 
adventure we have all been looking forward to. If you want to have a 
chat with a player, it leads nicely into it, rather than asking someone 
after dinner to come and speak to you, which is formal.’

Hodgson
 has thrown a protective cloak around his players after criticism of his
 selection of Manchester United pair Chris Smalling and Phil Jones. 
Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane was scathing about the pair 
after Hodgson called them into his 23-man World Cup squad. Keane claimed
 the pair ‘have gone  backwards’ at United and questioned the wisdom of 
taking them to football’s biggest tournament.

Hodgson
 added: ‘I work on the simple basis that everyone has an opinion. If you
 are a TV pundit you are required to give your opinion and I don’t 
expect everyone’s to fall in with mine. If you say to me, has it been a 
great year for United and have Phil Jones and Smalling been stars, then 
of course they haven’t. But as far as I am concerned they are England 
players because they have been England players through my two years and 
any games in particular that Smalling has played —he has played more 
than Jones — he has certainly never let me down.’

Safe hands: Goalkeeper Joe Hart and Ben Foster test each other during training in Portugal

Hodgson
 also approved of Jack Wilshere’s decision to speak with Paul Scholes 
over his criticism of the Arsenal midfielder’s development. Wilshere 
tracked Scholes down through England assistant coach Gary Neville after 
he claimed the Arsenal FA Cup winner had failed to develop.

Hodgson
 added: ‘I’m always pleased when players handle those moments in the 
right way. When he had a  (Twitter) row with Kevin Pietersen that was at
 the other end of the scale...but it’s not going to decide if we have a 
good World Cup or not. If Jack answers criticism well or badly, it’s 
what he does on the field that matters.’

England
 return home at the weekend before convening at St George’s Park on 
Monday to prepare for a farewell friendly against Peru at Wembley 
tomorrow week.

Everton 
defender John Stones, who is on standby for the squad, missed the 
session after tweaking his knee. Jones, who is recovering from a 
shoulder injury, should be able to take part in contact training later 
this week.

 have started.’
