Even when posting a cute image of himself as a baby for fans on Instagram, Lewis Hamilton has his mind on repeating 2014's Formula One world drivers' championship triumph in 2015.

Hamilton turned 30 on Wednesday and told fans 'I'm going for number 3!' at the end of a heartfelt Instagram post to his followers just over two months out from the first race of the season in Australia.

The Briton, who was born in Stevenage on January 7 in 1985, had one hell of a year in 2014 winning not only his second world title ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg but the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ahead of Rory McIlroy.

With plenty to be thankful for, Hamilton paid tribute to his parents in a touching post on social media.

'It is hard to believe that 30 years have passed. So many great memories,' Hamilton wrote. 'I have lived my life to fullest and am grateful for the years I've had.

'I want to thank my beautiful mum for bringing me into this world lovingly, and my dad for being such a great father.'

'I hope I get to see many more years and create more memories.'

Hamilton is in the process of negotiating a new deal with Mercedes on his own behalf after splitting with management company XIX last year. 

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has confirmed he is lining up Fernando Alonso in the event of Hamilton not choosing to stay with the team which dominated 2014, but it's believed an agreement is around the corner. 

But his mind isn't just on business and continuing to excel on the track, he has big dreams for the world as a whole.

'I want to see us all help heal this world,' says Hamilton, who has spoken of his plans to do humanitarian work when he's finished behind the wheel.

'And I hope and pray that in the not too distant future, every child gets to live a healthy and happy life just as I have. Thank you all, my fans, for supporting me. 

'We win and we lose together.'

The 2015 Formula One season begins in Melbourne, Australia, on March 14.
