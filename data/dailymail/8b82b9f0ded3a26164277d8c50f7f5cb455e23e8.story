Alistair Cook and his England side may not be covering themselves in glory at present, but at least one English cricketer is providing some heroics.

Somerset's Marcus Trescothick was surprised when he found a hedgehog stuck in the bars of his front gate.

The opening batsman, who retired from 
internationals in 2008, tried in vain to free the wedged creature before
 experts from a local wildlife charity used an axle grinder to slice 
through his gates.

The female hedgehog was given a clean bill of health before being released back into the cricketer’s garden in Taunton, Somerset.

The 38-year-old Trescothick praised the efforts of staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in nearby Highbridge, which is holding a hedgehog open weekend this Saturday and Sunday.

He said: 'It was a bit different holding a prickly ball rather than a cricket ball.

'My wife and family were delighted with the fast response from Secret World and hope their forthcoming weekend is a huge success.'

The drama began last week when Trescothick and his wife woke up to find the hedgehog wedged in the lower rungs of their front gates.

After failing to prise the animal free he called in Secret World and gave them permission to cut through the gates.

Secret World founder Pauline Kidner said: 'Hedgehogs are renowned for getting themselves into prickly situations like this.

'We are delighted that on this occasion the hedgehog was able to be returned back into Mr Trescothick’s garden.

'He was a part of the rescue mission too. He held her back whilst we were cutting through the bars.
