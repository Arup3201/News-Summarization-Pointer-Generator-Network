A couple who were spared jail after they broke a toddler’s leg, foot and arms will have their sentence reviewed by the Government after a petition to put them behind bars was started - by a disgusted friend.

Emma Cartwright and partner Neil Gleaves, both 27, left the injured youngster for two days before taking the child to hospital.

Cartwright was also convicted of slapping a baby in the face before Gleaves violently shook it.

A judge sparked national outrage after he handed the couple, from Wolstanton, Staffordshire, suspended sentences of two years because it was their first offence and Gleaves was 'hardworking'.

Spared
 jail: Emma Cartwright, 27, and her partner Neil Gleaves, also 27, were 
given a 36-week prison sentence suspended for two years after being 
convicted of child cruelty and neglect. But a petition, signed by 1,000, could see them put behind bars

Recorder Simon Ward also ordered Gleaves to complete 100 hours of unpaid work when they were convicted on May 24.

Now their sentence could be reviewed after 1,000 people signed a petition calling on the pair to be jailed.

The online petition was started by Cartwright’s former friend Nicola Linyard.

Ms Linyard, 29, also from Wolstanton, was so appalled at the lenient sentence she also wrote to the Government demanding the couple were jailed.

The Attorney General today asked the Crown Prosecution Service to pass on details about the case.

A decision will then be made on whether to send the case to the Court of Appeal for a sentence review.

A spokesman for the Attorney 
General’s Office said: 'We have asked the CPS for more information to 
decide whether the sentence should be referred to the Court of Appeal 
for review.

'The power to refer sentences is subject to a strict 28-day time limit from the day of sentencing.

'This case is within that time limit and either the attorney or the solicitor general will make their decision in due course.'

The couple could be jailed for a maximum of ten years.

At the lower end of the scale, the 
guidelines state a sentence of anything between 12 weeks in custody to a
 community order can be imposed for offences involving short-term 
neglect or ill-treatment, a single incident of short-term abandonment or
 a failure to protect a child.

Staff found the toddler's leg had been broken for at least two days before it was brought in to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire

Ms Linyard, who started the petition 
after she acted as a prosecution witness during the trial, said: 'People
 here are absolutely disgusted with the sentence and they both deserve 
to be jailed.

'The sentence is unbelievable. It’s like the judge is sending out a message to say that it’s OK to be cruel to children.

'Drink-drivers get sent straight down, but these two have been allowed to walk free.

'I’m glad the Attorney General has listened to the protests and I hope it leads to them being given a proper sentence - in prison.'

Alan Knipe-Smith, landlord of the Eagle and Child pub in nearby Chesterton, said: 'Gleaves used to come here but he’s certainly not welcome anymore.

'To say it’s their first offence can hardly be a reason to treat them leniently. What they did is disgusting and they should have been jailed.'

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard X-rays revealed the child had suffered a catalogue of fractures to both arms, both legs, the left foot and left shoulder.

At the trial, Recorder Ward told them: 'You’ve both been convicted of very serious offences and you’re going to have to live with the consequences.

'Offences of cruelty and ill-treatment of children are so serious that the courts have to send out a message to people that, if convicted, serious sentences will follow.'

The couple were spared jail after the judge heard how the defendants had no previous convictions.

Nick
 Tatlow, defending, also said Cartwright had experienced a 'troubled' 
past and had been cared for by 14 different foster families as a child.

He said: 'Her actions amounted to a temporary loss of temper.'

Anis
 Ali, defending Gleaves added: 'He is, and was, a hard-working 
individual. He understands the consequences of this conviction will last
 forever.'

The court heard the couple attacked 
the toddler, who was taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire
 with serious injuries.

On arriving at hospital, shocked doctors found the child’s right leg had been broken at least two days earlier.

David
 Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Neither defendant could account for how 
that injury was caused. The medical staff were concerned and a full 
radiological survey was carried out.

'The whole body was X-rayed and it was discovered the child had a number of significant injuries to its bones.

'The
 child had fractures to both arms, both legs, left foot and left 
shoulder, all of which, it was deemed by the medical staff, were 
non-accidental injuries and were caused deliberately to the child.'

Cartwright and Gleaves have now fled the area.
