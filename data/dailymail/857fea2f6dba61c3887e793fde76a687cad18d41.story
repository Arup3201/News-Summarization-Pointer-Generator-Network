ON SILBURY HILL by Adam Thorpe (Little Toller Books £15) 

When I went to University College London — before the M4 was constructed — my father would drive me (with all my bags and books) from our Wiltshire home, along the old Bath-London Road (now the A4).

Each time we passed Silbury Hill, I would gaze up in fascination at the extraordinary, large tump at the side of the road, while my father hazarded guesses as to who built it and for what purpose.

He liked to read about ancient history, and had a good line in ghostly speculation, too. Was it once an island, part of a sacred complex, or a resting place for the long-dead? What would it be like to climb it, at night, in a howling wind?

The dark secret of the purpose of pre-historic Silbury Hill, in Wiltshire, still remains unknown

We know that Silbury is the largest prehistoric man-made mound in Europe — covering an area the size of three football pitches and probably built over a period of 100 years. But deeper certainty has always eluded those who have dug, tunnelled, photographed and studied it, from generations of archaeologists to writers such as Adam Thorpe. The enigma of this hill has inspired artists and poets, simply because people like mysteries.

And what could be more mysterious than an upside-down pudding basin of earth and grass, a layer-cake of history plonked (by the devil, they used to say) at the side of an ancient route by the River Kennet?

In his prize-winning book Ulverton, poet, novelist, playwright, and teacher (and not to mention one-time actor and puppeteer) Adam Thorpe gave us a brilliant overview of rural history.

Now, he offers an equally creative, personal panorama of the hill he fell in love with as a boy. At nearby Marlborough College, he suffered the rules, torments and privations long-associated with English boarding schools, but escaped whenever possible into the surrounding downlands to climb strange Silbury and set his imagination free.

That sense of wonder remains: ‘She was constructed without earth-movers or diggers, without power tools, without iron tools, without rulers and surveying instruments and hard hats, with only antler picks and ox shoulder blades and wickerwork baskets, plus human muscle.

The hill is equivalent in size to a 13-storey building and yet was created without the aid of modern day tools

‘At around 130 feet high, she is equivalent to a 13-storey building. If the Titanic sailed just behind her in your dreams, you would only see the smoke from the funnels.’ Thorpe’s narrative is as meandering as a walk up a tor, looping around and along tracks created by fox and badger, retracing steps, stopping to gaze at the surrounding landscape, and always entertained by reminiscences, happy and sad alike.

In that sense, On Silbury Hill is another example of what might be called the new nature writing: unashamedly idiosyncratic and deeply personal, yet as well-researched as any historian would wish.

Thorpe’s memories take us from Marlborough bullies to episodes in India and Cameroon, as well as stories from his days as a travelling player and neo-hippy. But, always, Silbury Hill is the lodestone that draws him back, and he wanders afresh around the surrounding countryside, taking in the dark secrets of Avebury, and speculating on both those ancient stones and the ones at Stonehenge — feeling ill at ease (it seems) in this modern world.

Silbury Hill is located near to the ancient route of the River Kennet , which has long since dried up (left) and the mound has always intrigued author Adam Thorpe (right)

In a fascinating series of interwoven strands, this book blends history, myth, archaeology, topography and poetry, and always leads us back to the haunting beauty of the question: ‘Why?’

Silbury will keep its secrets — but, on the subject of beauty and history, I must add that, in this era of digital downloads, it’s a real delight (and relief) to hold in my hand a small volume as perfect as this one, a work to treasure, part of the series of Little Toller Monographs, published in Dorset, and worthy of its subject.
