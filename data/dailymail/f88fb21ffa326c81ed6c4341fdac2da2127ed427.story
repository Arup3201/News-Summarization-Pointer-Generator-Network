In October 2007, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy travelled to Seville to meet the man of the moment. On this occasion it was Juande Ramos.

Sevilla’s coach had won two UEFA Cups on the bounce and seemed like a good bet to replace Martin Jol as Tottenham’s new manager.

A few months after his appointment at White Hart Lane, central defender Jonathan Woodgate referred to him as ‘a proper manager’ when they progressed to the final of the Carling Cup.

Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has a tendency to appoint the 'man of the moment' at White Hart Lane

It looked like they were finally on to a good thing, but that has been said at Spurs a few times.

Under Levy’s stewardship, this man-of-the-moment mentality has become something of a trend at White Hart Lane. They simply have to have it.

Shortly after Ramos won the League Cup at Wembley with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in extra time - the club’s last major trophy - he was fired after a few dodgy results the following season.

Harry Redknapp was rewarded for his survival exploits at Portsmouth and the victory over Cardiff in the 2008 FA Cup final by landing the Spurs job. Again, he was another man of the moment.

Even Andre Villas-Boas, sacked by Chelsea in February 2012, was still operating in the after-glow of his treble with Porto when he replaced Redknapp.

Steffen Freund, a former Tottenham player, was brought in from a decent position with the DFB to work as the assistant manager. Freund has since been moved aside and is working as a club ambassador.

When things are going wrong, as they certainly appear to be at Tottenham, Levy will always make moves to appease the supporters.

Which takes us to Paul Mitchell.

The wheels were in motion to bring in Southampton’s head of recruitment several days before Tottenham were well beaten by Stoke at White Hart Lane on November 9.

Earlier that week Mitchell had reluctantly been paraded by Southampton at the opening of the club’s new sparkling training centre, where he spoke enthusiastically about the future of the club.

By then, he knew he was on his way to north London.

His reputation has soared in recent months and rightly so. Mitchell was part of former executive chairman Nicola Cortese’s vision for the club.

The signing of Dejan Lovren is, possibly, Mitchell’s biggest success.

During his spell at Lyon, the Croatia central defender was overlooked by scouts of Europe’s leading clubs because of a perceived problem with his discipline.

He was often suspended, missing key games in the French league because he accumulated too many bookings.

To Mitchell’s credit, he had watched Lovren live so many times that he realised the Croat was a victim of the high defensive line employed by the Lyon coach Remi Garde.

Southampton signed him for £8.5m in the summer of 2013 and he looked every inch a Champions League player in his debut season on the south coast.

A year later he was sold to Liverpool for £20m and what has happened to his form since then is Brendan Rodgers’ business, not Mitchell’s.

Southampton’s capture of Lovren, and his subsequent performances at the heart of their defence, earned Mitchell respect throughout the club. He was a steal.

His eye for a player is well known in the game and his enthusiasm for travel has distinguished him from many of his contemporaries at other clubs. This bodes well for Tottenham.

Levy has started a massive restructuring programme of his scouting and recruitment divisions after realising just how far behind they are in terms of modern methods.

For too long they have relied on the Scout7 and Wyscout systems to alert them to player performance around the world.

Levy, aware that north London rivals Arsenal have 12 full-time, paid scouts, has realised they need to get out there and start watching some games. Mitchell is that man.

He has joined a club that is widely-recognised as the most political in the Barclays Premier League and there are too many people wanting to hang around the first team on matchday.

Part of Levy’s masterplan is to bringing some structure to the club’s recruitment policy after squandering the Gareth Bale money in a calamitous supermarket sweep before the transfer deadline in 2013.

Mitchell, to his credit, is the answer. There are few more hard-working men operating behind the scenes and he will go to any game, anywhere.

Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton

Current Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino lobbied for Mitchell's appointment

Mauricio Pochettino has been lobbying Levy for his appointment, promising the Tottenham chairman that he can make the difference behind the scenes. The pressure is on.

It represents quite a change of heart by Tottenham’s head coach because he has left Oscar Perarnau, his sporting director at his previous club Espanyol, high and dry since moving to England.

There was a time when Pochettino wanted Perarnau at Southampton and had argued his case for his arrival with Cortese. He remained loyal to Mitchell.

There will be more upheaval at Spurs in the coming weeks as Levy recruits some full-time scouts to work with Mitchell.

If it doesn’t work out this time, then it will be time for the main man to come under pressure.
