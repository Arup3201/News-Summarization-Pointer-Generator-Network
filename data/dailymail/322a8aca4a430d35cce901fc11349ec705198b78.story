The little brother of a nine-year-old fatally stabbed at a playground near his western Michigan home had touching and shockingly mature words to share at a memorial service Wednesday.

Kameron Verkerke, at just 7-years-old, told a packed church in Kent County that his brother Connor--who he helped get home in the wake of the tragedy--would have wanted his family to stay strong despite their pain.

'It's hard to go through this,' Kameron said. 'But he's in a better place, and we know that he doesn't want us to be sad all our life. We know he wants us to be happy, even though it's really hard to.'

After Kameron's beautiful speech, his mother Dani gave him a much deserved high-five as the mournful event continued.

Michael Connor Verkerke's 'life had barely begun,' Pastor Brad Kalajainen told the hundreds of mourners at Cornerstone Church.

The
 boy, called Connor by family and friends, was playing with some other 
children on the playground in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids, on August 4, 
when witnesses say one boy pulled a knife and stabbed Connor in the 
back.

Connor died at a hospital, and the alleged assailant, a 12-year-old, is facing a murder charge.

The service was largely free of talk about the incident.

Horrific: The nine-year-old was remembered as a big-hearted and fun-loving boy who was taken much too soon

State of shock: Connor's grandmother, Toni Nunemaker, gave a speech during the memorial service at Cornerstone Church in Caledonia, Michigan

'It was all about Connor, whose father called him 'one of my heroes.'

'I have never known anybody' who loved as much as 'my nine-year-old son,' said Jared Verkerke.

He was one of several family members, teachers and others who spoke at the service.

Many attendees were dressed in their Boy Scouts uniforms. Connor was a Cub Scout and hoped to become an Eagle Scout one day.

The scouts gave Connor a special 'Scout salute' in front of a collection of his favorite things, reports the Detroit Free Press, including a skateboard, a soccer ball and favorite books.

As they later filed out, the scouts would salute Connor's family as the Beatle's song Blackbird played.

Dearly missed: Crowds gather at a vigil held earlier this month for Connor

Connor was the oldest of four boys.

A judge on Monday ordered a mental competency exam for the 12-year-old boy charged in Connor's death.

The Associated Press isn't naming the 12-year-old because of his age.

He's
 designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, meaning he'd be 
sentenced as a juvenile if convicted and then resentenced as an adult 
once he turns 21.

State 
mental health experts will examine the 12-year-old and report on whether
 they believe he is mentally competent to stand trial.

That is expected to bring a delay of several months.
