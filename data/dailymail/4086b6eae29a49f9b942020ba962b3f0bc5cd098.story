A video showing a pilot's eye view of death defying aeroplane stunts has emerged from the Cameron air show in Missouri, US this year.

In the clip we see the pilot performing white knuckle moves as he nosedives back to earth at speed and even flies through flames.

Loop-the-loops and spiralling back down to ground level were just two of the stomach-churning tricks the pilots pulled at the event. 

And the action culminated in a plane flying so low that a motorcyclist could grab a wing to propel him along a runway at breakneck speed.

Kyle Franklin, a pilot who performed at the show this month, knows better than anyone that the stunts can be life or death after losing his wife, father and father-in-law on the airfield.

He told freejohnnydare.com: 'It's rough. We've paid a high price to stay in this business. But I love to fly and one thing I love more than anything is entertaining. 

'The reason we keep doing this is mainly for all of the spectators who come out and see us. I get letters from people telling me I inspired them how to fly - that's the main reason I stay in the air show business. '

Give me a hand: A motorcyclist at the Cameron stunt show grabs on to the wing of an aeroplane

His wife Amanda Franklin, 25, was killed at an air show in 2011 after wing-walking on the plane which was being flown by her husband.

When the aircraft's engine stuttered and caught fire during the stunt in Brownsville, Texas, Kyle tried to save his wife who released her safety harness on the wing and got back inside the plane, but she suffered 70 per cent burns when it crash-landed. 

She spent the next two months fighting for life but later died of her injuries. They pair had been dating since May 2004 after meeting an an air show. 

They married in 2005, three months after their fathers died in a similarly horrific crash. Bobby Younkin and Jimmy Franklin were good friends and had flown together on numerous occasions.

Before the fateful flight, Amanda said: 'If you live your life in fear that something could go wrong, you're not living your life'. Kyle continues to fly three years after the loss of his wife, father and father-in-law

But on July 10, 2005 at an air show in Canada, the pair – who were flying separate planes – collided with each other and were both killed.

Kyle and Amanda’s website explains: ‘Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on the wings of airplanes.’
