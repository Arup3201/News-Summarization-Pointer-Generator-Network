Tom Huddlestone has urged Hull City to sign Arsenal's striker Yaya Sanogo on loan as boss Steve Bruce admitted the Tigers' defence struggled to cope with the powerful young Frenchman in the FA Cup final.

Bruce has been in contact with Arsene Wenger about a loan move - but there are rival clubs interested too.

Midfielder Huddlestone said: 'I was speaking to a couple of the lads yesterday when we heard the rumour and they were saying he's a handful.

Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone has praised Sanogo, calling him an 'intelligent footballer'

'He's an intelligent footballer for one so young. The times I've seen him at Arsenal, I think he's done very well.

'He's been a bit unlucky at Arsenal in front of goal and at the highest level, which Arsenal is, you probably need to be a bit more clinical but football-wise he's done well. He's impressed me.'

Sanogo grabbed his first competitive goal in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund but he has yet to score in the league in 11 appearances for Arsenal.

That lack of goals has not put off Bruce, who is also aware of his two goals as France Under-21s came back to beat England 3-2 in November.

Bruce said: 'To be fair to him, how many times has he played? It's always very difficult coming on as sub.

Tigers boss Steve Bruce has also admitted that he has been impressed by the Frenchman

'I don't know how many starts he's had but he played against us in the cup final and I was very impressed with him. I saw him play for Arsenal against Dortmund in the Champions League as well.

'For the French under-21s he's been nothing short of fantastic. I saw a game when they beat England and I thought he was terrific.

'When you take a young boy, especially a striker, it's a question of whether they can come and do it. I took Nicklas Bendtner (on loan from Arsenal for Birmingham) when he was 18 and he won me (promotion from) the Championship.

'Sanogo is a very good player. I like him a lot and it may be an option for us - but I don't think we're alone in that one.'
