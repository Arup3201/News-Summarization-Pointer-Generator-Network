Criminal cop: Jose Ramos, who was implicated as the mastermind behind the ticket-fixing scandal, allegedly tried to have the lead witness against him killed

The police officer who was the mastermind behind the New York City ticket-fixing scandal now faces charges of trying to hire a hit man so that he could have the lead witness against him killed. 

Jose Ramos was already in Rikers Jail- because of his two dozen prior charges- when the district attorney's office filed charges alleging that he helped his wife plan the hit while he was behind bars from September to May.

At the indictment on Thursday, his wife Wanda Abreu began crying when she said she was not guilty of the three counts of conspiracy and lone count of criminal solicitation.

Her husband also entered a not guilty plea for the same charges, but the prosecution feels that they have a strong case as they have been recording the couples' interactions.

The murder-for-hire accusations can be added to his long list of alleged crimes including robbery, transporting heroin, and selling counterfeit DVDS, which all took place while he was in uniform.

According to The New York Times, Ramos and Abreu would use up to five different codenames for the lead witness while plotting the hit during her visits to see Ramos in jail.

At one point, he made it clear how vital the witness was to the ticket-fixing scandal by saying 'Without him there is no case. They need him.'

The witness has not been publicly identified, nor has the hit man that Abreu planned to hire.

'They were willing to pay a fee, but it was crucial to them they not be involve in the murder,' assistant district attorney Omer Wiczyk said at the indictment.

'Ramos and Abreu have no problems having an individual murdered, they just did not want to get their hands dirty,' The Wall Street Journal reports Mr Wiczyk as saying.

MSNBC News reports that Abreu suspected that their calls were being recorded and suggested that they stop the plan before she delivered the money.

Disgraced: Ramos was a 17-year veteran of the NYPD with a vast criminal rap sheet including drug transportation, robbery and insurance fraud

Ramos, 43, told her to stay the course, saying 'Go ahead, do it. But do it right away.'

Abreu, 39, withdrew an undisclosed amount from Ramos' New York City Police Department pension.

This is far from the beginning of the couples' criminal history, as Abreu was accused of insurance fraud in October at the same time that her husband was charged with 24 other crimes.

At the time of the ticket-fixing scandal last fall, when he and 15 other officers were indicted for 'taking care of' parking tickets for their family and friends, he had already accrued quite a rapsheet.

The New York Daily News
reports that in 2009 he took $10,000 to deliver what he believed to be 
heroin to an undercover cop who was pretending to be a drug dealer.

At
another point in his 17-year police career, he took $30,000 from a 
different undercover cop who pretended to be interested in buying stolen
electronics.

He stole a further $20,000 from a person buying drugs in a hotel room.

And the final straw was when he was charged with buying heroin while on duty, in his uniform, driving his patrol car.

Ramos is not ready to add conspiracy and criminal solicitation to the list, however, and his lawyer said they plan to fight the charges.Their second-degree conspiracy charges carry a standard sentence of 25-years in prison.

'We are totally blindsided by these charges. My client is saying he has no involvement with this,' Dawn Florio said at Thursday's indictment.
