Mitt Romney has been holidaying on a Maui beach for New Year’s as President Barack Obama plays golf just miles away on the island.

Mr Romney, the former presidential candidate, brought in the New Year with his family including two of his sons, Tagg and Matt, but there was no sign of the adopted black grandchild who was the butt of a political joke earlier this week.

As Mr Romney sunned himself, his 2012 political opponent took to the golf course, playing nearly five hours at the Mid Pacific Country Club golf course in Kailua’s Lanikai neighborhood.

Life's a beach: Mitt Romney celebrated New Year's Day with his family on a beach in Maui while Obama played golf just miles away

Mr Romney, who will celebrated his 67th birthday in March, seemed relaxed, dressed in board shorts and a black polo shirt despite the outrage caused by MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry when she ridiculed a photo of the extensive Romney family and its single black member, a baby.

'It really sums up the diversity of the Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black person,' joked Dean Obeidallah, in a dig made at the expense of Kieran Romney.

Harris-Perry is herself African-American and her show often focuses on black issues. The seemingly light-hearted segment presented photos and asked panelists to 'caption' them them jokes and commentary.

For her part, Harris-Perry did not 
directly ridicule the baby but did quip that she looked forward to a 
2040 'wedding between Kieran Romney and North West [the daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian].' 

On Tuesday, in a series of tweets, Harris-Perry apologized to the Romney family.

'I am sorry. Without reservation or qualification. I apologize to the Romney family,' she tweeted, with the hastag #MHPapology.

'I work by guiding principle that those who offend do not have the right to tell those they hurt that they r wrong for hurting.

'Therefore, while I meant no offense, I want to immediately apologize to the Romney family for hurting them.'

Mr Obama's
 vacation lasts until Sunday and the $4 million price tag that some news
 outlets have put on the stay has prompted some grumbling: While Mr Obama and friends pay for the private vacation rental in Kailua, which fetches some $25,000 a week, taxpayers pick up the majority of the bill for the rest of the trip, according to The Hawaii Reporter.

Michael Tasselmyer 
of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, told the website that he estimated the 18-hour round 
trip flight to Hawaii and back aboard Air Force One at $3,235,500. 
That's $179,750 per hour for flight and operation.

The
 Obamas are generally warmly received in Hawaii, although demonstrators
 protested on Saturday against unmanned drones in an area near the first 
family's vacation home.
