Roy Hodgson fiercely defended England following a drab performance in-front of a half-empty Wembley.

Wayne Rooney spared England's blushes, scoring the winner from the spot on his first appearance as skipper in front of 40,181 spectators - the lowest attendance for an England match at the revamped Wembley.

England managed just two shots on target - one being Rooney's penalty - all night.

But Hodgson angrily leaped to the defence of his team, saying: 'Two shots on target? Don't give me that one.

'Two shots? What about all the ones they threw themselves in front of... don't hit me with statistics.

'When we had that much possession, and you talk about two shots on target?

'We're not scoring a lot of goals, but we're not playing against teams who come out against us a lot. This team will score goals.

'I thought the performance was quite good. I was pleased with the first half, we probed well with good movements.

'I was disappointed with the start of the second half when we didn't do anything as like as well for the first 15 minutes, but then we changed things, changed the formation slightly, and finished the game strongly.'

Despite the criticism, the England manager hinted his side are unlikely to show more attacking verve against Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday.

'Switzerland will need to beat us, if anything, we might be Norway on Monday,' said Hodgson.

'We might be pushed back and can't attack and dominate for long periods, as we did today. I don't know.

'I don't think the mind-set of the Swiss team, playing us in Basel, will be the same as the mind-set of the Norwegians.'

Raheem Sterling, who won the winning penalty, was a rare bright spot on a mediocre night for England.

Sterling added to his growing reputation as one of Europe's premier young players with a superb display, deservedly winning the man of the match award.

The Liverpool forward started the game on the left, but switched to a central position in the second half where he looked dangerous.

And manager Hodgson, who revealed Jack Colback has returned to Newcastle with a calf injury, admits he may consider playing Sterling through the middle against Switzerland.

'When Sterling moved into the centre he showed the full range of his dribbling ability, so it's nice to know we have these options and won't be totally restricted to one way of playing.'
