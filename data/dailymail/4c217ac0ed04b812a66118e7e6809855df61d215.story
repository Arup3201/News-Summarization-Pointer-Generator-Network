A nine-year-old autistic boy who was reported missing by his mother was eventually discovered buried in filth in a bedroom inside her squalid home.

Police officers responding to mother-of-two Christina Milligan's 911 call found her son surrounded by piles of festering garbage and mounds of dirty diapers at the cockroach-infested apartment in Sacramento, California.

Officers, who arrested Milligan, 30, on charges of child endangerment, said the nine-year-old boy had been 'forced to live in filth'.

Arrested: Christina Milligan, 30, was arrested after she called police to report that her autistic nine-year-old had gone missing from her home and  deputies  found the boy buried in filth in one of the bedrooms

When the 30-year-old called police to report her son missing at the weekend, officers arrived at the address to find all available surfaces and most of the floor space covered in garbage.

After picking their way through the piles of waste, discarded food and dirty diapers, shocked police discovered the missing boy wearing filthy, urine-soaked clothes and 'surrounded by squalor' in a bedroom.

Sacramento County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Ramos described cockroaches scrambling across the walls inside the 'trashed' apartment, which was pervaded by the stench of urine, he said.

The autistic boy and Milligan's younger son, aged two, were both taken into custody by Child Protective Services.

Milligan posted bail and was released on Sunday night.

Milligan had another child, a two-year-old, who was taken into custody by Child Protective Services along with the nine-year-old

Neighbours in South Sacramento were stunned to hear of the squalid conditions Milligan's children had been forced to endure.

One woman said she had never noticed anything strange about the 30-year-old mother.

'I
always see her walking around with a stroller and just being nice, 
saying hi and bye and [being] polite,' Karina Meza-Cruz told local news 
station KXTV.

On her Facebook profile, Milligan has posted several photos of herself with her sons. The boys are smiling in all of the photos.
