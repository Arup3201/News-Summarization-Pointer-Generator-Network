On June 6, 1944, The Allies launched the biggest seaborne invasion ever seen, Operation Overlord, as they attempted to overcome the Nazi juggernaut that had conquered most of mainland Europe.

That attack, and the battles that followed, would see some of the fiercest fighting of the Second World War brought to the coast and countryside of France.

Here an incredible set of photographs shows those battlefields as they were then, littered with burned out planes, wounded soldiers and destroyed buildings, and as they are now, packed with tourists, sunbathers, and beach huts.

Packed with landing craft, tanks, trucks, soldiers and anti-aircraft balloons, it is difficult to recognise the beach near Coleville-sur-Mer, code-named Omaha Beach, when it is set against its serene modern-day counterpart, home to nothing more than a few walkers and a caravan.

The invasion: U.S. craft of all shapes and sizes crowd onto Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 (top), to disgorge troops and equipment during the first stages of the Allied counter-attack, the greatest seaborne invasion in history. Bottom: 70 years on in May this year, the beach near Colleville-sur-Mer is a haven of peace

Calmer waters: U.S. troops are helped ashore after their craft was sunk by enemy fire at Omaha Beach — which is now a popular spot for sunbathers

Chaos of war: A crashed U.S. fighter plane on the waterfront at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer near Juno Beach bears testament to the ferocity of fighting, where flags now fly prettily along the promenade

Watching history: Residents look on as a Canadian bulldozer clears the Rue de Bayeux after the battle for Caen — the church towers somehow survived the Allied bombing, but much of the city had to be rebuilt

Everyday horrors: The body of a dead German soldier lies in the main square of Trevieres near Omaha Beach. Today, the town is popular with families

Streets of change: A French tank gets a warm welcome passing through Sainte Mere Eglise — today the bombed building is a clothes shop

Sands of time: Captured German soldiers at Bernieres-sur Mer, which was one of the first liberated towns
