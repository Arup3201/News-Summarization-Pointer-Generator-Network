Mocking short people is as bad as racism, the Commons' Speaker John Bercow has suggested.

Mr Bercow, who stands just 5ft 6in tall, said it was 'somehow acceptable' to criticise people over their height when attacking someone for their skin colour or sexuality was widely accepted as being wrong.

The Speaker has been widely ridiculed in the Commons over his height - with both Tory backbenchers and even the Prime Minister poking fun at his stature.

Commons Speaker John Bercow  - pictured with his wife Sally - has criticised the public acceptance of mocking short people. But he said he was 'never bothered' by people ridiculing his height

In 2010 the Conservatve MP Simon Burns referred to the Speaker as as a 'stupid, sanctimonious dwarf'. He later apologised to all dwarves for his comments.

David Cameron also joked that Mr Bercow was one of the seven dwarfs at a lunch with journalists in Westminster.

Now Mr Bercow, who is only three inches shorter than the UK 5ft 9in average height in Britain, has attacked society’s acceptance of derogatory remarks relating to people’s height.

Speaking to The Times Magazine, Mr Bercow said: ‘Whereas nobody these days would regard it as acceptable to criticise someone on grounds of race or creed or disability or sexual orientation, somehow it seems to be acceptable to comment on someone’s height, or lack of it.’

Sally Bercow, who caused controversy after posing in just a bed sheet in front of Parliament, said her husband's job had made him more sexy

Mr Bercow claimed the issue doesn’t affect him personally, however he described rude comments about height ‘intellectually substandard and schoolboyish’. Mr Bercow, 51, said he was 'never bothered about being short'.

In the same interview, Mr Bercow rejected claims from his wife Sally - who stands at 5ft 10in - that his powerful Commons' had made him more attractive.

He said: 'I have most certainly not become a sex symbol. She [his wife] does have a very good sense of humour.'

In 2011 Mrs Bercow sent ripples around Westminster when she appeared in a newspaper wearing nothing but a bedsheet.

She also spoke at the time of the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster.

Mr Bercow said the couple are not fazed by scrutiny of their marriage, which has made headlines on a number of occasions.

'Sally and I have our own approach to marriage and we are perfectly comfortable in our own skin,' he said.

'And, in the politest possible way, I think I would say: if other people disapprove of it or think it should be otherwise, that’s their problem, not ours.'
