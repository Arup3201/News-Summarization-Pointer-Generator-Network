A blind great-grandmother died in a failing hospital after no one checked on her for 12 hours.

Barbara White, 77, was admitted with stomach pains and dizziness and when a nurse finally saw her she was seriously ill with a bowel infection.

But doctors were not alerted for two more hours, by which time she was suffering cardiac arrest and struggling to breathe.

Barbara White, 77, died of a bowel infection after staff at Tameside Hospital failed to check on her for 12 hours meaning they did not realised she had become critically ill

Despite undergoing emergency surgery 
at Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Manchester, Mrs White
 died three weeks later.

An inquest in Trafford also heard that records about observations that should have been made on her had been destroyed.

In
 what her family said was her first time in hospital, Mrs White was 
admitted in December 8 last year and after seven hours in A&E was 
placed on a ward with 19 other patients.

However, because of staff shortages, one of the two nurses was replaced by a healthcare assistant with no medical training.

Between
 6pm and 6am, no observations were made on her and Mrs White’s family 
fear her blindness meant she could not have found the buzzer to raise 
the alarm.

An on-call 
doctor did not visit her despite an earlier request for blood tests and 
X-ray results to be reviewed overnight. The record of this request has 
been destroyed and the inquest heard conflicting accounts from doctors 
over whether they knew she was on the surgical ward.

A
 nurse examined her at 6am, but the results were initially wrongly 
interpreted and her condition was not flagged up to doctors until 8am.

Just one qualified nurse was left to look after 20 seriously ill patients on Tameside Hospital's surgical unit the night Barbara White, 77, was admitted, an inquest was told

It
 is believed that she lost consciousness during the night and by the 
time a doctor saw her she was going into cardiac arrest and struggling 
to breathe because of a bowel infection caused by gallstones.

She underwent emergency bowel surgery and a tracheotomy but did not recover and died on January 2.

South
 Manchester coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded a verdict of death by 
natural causes, with respiratory distress caused by sepsis and 
cholangitis – infection of the small intestine.

She
 added that she would write to the hospital with her concerns over the 
evidence given at the hearing and the treatment of Mrs White.

Had
 she lived she would have celebrated her diamond wedding anniversary 
with her husband Albert this year. He said: ‘The NHS let Barbara down 
terribly – the way they treated her is absolutely disgusting.

‘This
 should have been a very happy year for us – it was my 80th birthday, 
and we were going to Italy for our 60th wedding anniversary. Instead, 
we’ve been fighting for answers about why she never came out of 
hospital.’

An internal investigation at the hospital found a healthcare assistant unfamiliar with the surgical unit had been drafted in to replace a nurse when the ward was short-staffed

Mrs White’s daughter, Lynn White, 58, said: ‘I feel that in those 12 hours my mum could have been saved.’

Her
 son Keith, 56, added: ‘I know they were rushed off their feet that 
night but to have one nurse looking after 20 people is disgusting.’

Mrs
 White’s treatment is the latest case of scandalous treatment of 
pensioners in some parts of the NHS revealed by the Daily Mail’s Dignity
 for the Elderly campaign.

In
 July, Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust was one of 11 placed in 
special measures over failures that included overnight staffing ratios. 
It is also one of 14 trusts exposed as having high mortality rates which
 could be responsible for up to 13,000 ‘excess’ deaths since 2005, with 
Tameside’s figure 833.

Last
 night, a spokesman for the trust said it now aimed to provide one nurse
 to every eight patients on all wards but could not guarantee that 
healthcare assistants would not fill in again. The trust denied records 
about Mrs White’s care had been destroyed deliberately.

John
 Goodenough, director of nursing, said: ‘The trust extends its sincere 
condolences to Mr White and his family at this difficult time. We accept
 the verdict of Her Majesty’s Coroner in full.

‘In the past year, we have made many changes to address the concerns identified.’
