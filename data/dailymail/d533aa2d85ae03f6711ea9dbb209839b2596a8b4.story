Her older sister Kendall Jenner is now one of the biggest models in the world, but it looks like younger sibling Kylie is keen to follow in her footsteps.

The 17-year-old has now landed herself a shoot in the highly acclaimed fashion bible Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book.

And it has been seen as the the latest move by the youngest of the Kardashian clan to stake her claim in in the world of high fashion.

Kylie Jenner has been featured in Carine Roitfeld's Fashion Book, this is her latest foray into the fashion world after she starred in Kanye West's Adidas show in February

In the shoot, the caption below the image of Kylie says: 'She's a free spirit and her beauty vibrates with the energy of LA. I'm excited to see where she takes it.'

But this isn't the teenager's first foray into the style scene.

When Kanye West, who is married to her older sister Kim, recently debuted his first collection with sports brand Adidas, it was Kylie who he asked to star in his show in New York. 

And standing among his gaggle of models she looked every bit the part. Her normally made up look gone, she wore little make-up showing off her striking features.

Indeed, much was made of the fact that Kanye had choosen Kylie to model rather than the more successful Kendall who instead sitting front row with their mother Kris Jenner.

Kylie also recently landed the cover of Fault magazine, she posed in an Alexander Wang crop top with her hair pulled to the side in a fishtail plait.

More experimental than her sisters in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kylie regularly posts pictures of herself trying out different make-up and hairstyles on her Instagram account.

Kylie landed the cover of Fault magazines 20th Issue, she rocked a series of different looks for the brand

Her older sister Kim may have 'broken the internet' posing nude for Paper Magazine, but Kylie Jenner has made sure her front cover is all about style.

Rocking a cool lace beanie, a shed load of Cartier bracelets (that ring in at a cool £5000 each) and a statement chunky necklace, she looks incredibly fashion-forward. But it's the bralet that steals the show!

It's from the Alexander Wang x H&M collaboration and we love its sporty aesthetic which was a running theme throughout the whole line.

Predictably it sold out within hours, so unfortunately you'll need to head to eBay if you want to bag any of it now. Instead why not take a look at the T by Alexander Wang collection (right)? It's cheaper than his main line but still has the sporty, urban vibe.

Our selection of bralets below are ideal for channelling Kylie's look, but the sporty style by Stussy is particularly great for imitating her Alexander Wang original!

Kylie is known for experimenting with her look and regularly posts pictures of her different make-up and hair looks on Instagram

Of course, it is Kendall though who has been the darling of the fashion world for well over a year now. She's walked in high-profile shows such as Chanel, Oscar De La Renta and Balmain.

She counts fellow models Cara Delevingne and Gigi Hadid among her best friends and has landed campaigns for Givenchy and Marc Jacobs. 

In January she landed some of her highest praise yet when Chanel and Fendi head honcho and all round fashion impresario Karl Lagerfeld called her, 'the girl of the moment'.

So it is undoubted that Kylie has a long way to go before she can reach the dizzying heights of her sister's career. 

But if she's anything like her siblings, then she'll almost certainly have the determination to succeed. And there is nothing to stop the two of them working together.

Indeed, the pair have already collaborated on several lines for PacSun and in February it was confirmed they will be following in Kate Moss's footsteps and creating a capsule collection for Topshop.

It is also rumoured that the youngest two of the Kardashian family are in talks to do a spin-off show - just like Kourtney And Kim Take New York.

Kendall and Kylie are close, so close that it's been reported they may have their own spin off reality TV show
