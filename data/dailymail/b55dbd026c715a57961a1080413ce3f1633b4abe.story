A man has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter after a hiker was attacked and killed by a bull as he walked through a farm.

Roger Freeman was attacked by a bull in November 2010 as he walked with his wife Linda on a public freeway through a Nottinghamshire farm.

Mr Freeman, 63, who had owned a roofing business, was trampled so badly that his clothes had been ripped from his body.

His wife fought for her life in hospital after she managed to stagger to a nearby road where she flagged down a passing motorist for help.

Now Paul Waterfall, 39, who the CPS say was 
responsible for the farm and animals, has been charged with gross 
negligence manslaughter.

The pair had been on a theatre trip and had stayed overnight at a hotel.

The avid walkers planned to trek home to Glen Parva, in Leicestershire, stopping off in Loughborough for the night.

A statement by Alison Norton, Specialist Prosecutor handling Special Crime in the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'I have carefully examined the evidence gathered by Nottinghamshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive during their investigations into the death of Roger Freeman.

'Roger Freeman was tragically killed on 12 November 2010 after being attacked by a bull whilst walking on a public right of way through Underhill Farm at Stanford-on-Soar in Leicestershire.

'I have concluded there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge Paul Waterfall, who was responsible for Underhill Farm and its livestock at the time of the incident, with gross negligence manslaughter.

'This decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Roger Freeman.

'Paul Waterfall has been bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on 21 August. Criminal proceedings are now underway and Mr Waterfall has a right to a fair trial.'

It is not clear why the bull attacked the couple. After being contained 
in a shed just after the attack, the animal was put down.
