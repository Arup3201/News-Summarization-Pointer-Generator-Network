On the run: Murder suspect John Anslow escaped from a prison van earlier today

Police are hunting a dangerous prisoner after he was sprung from a prison van by a gang of masked men armed with knives and sledgehammers earlier today.

John Anslow, who faces a murder charge after a father-of-two was shot dead with a sawn-off shotgun as he lay in bed, was being driven to Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by three men at around 8.20am.

The gang smashed the windscreen of the GEO Amey escort vehicle before punching the driver and threatening him with a knife.

They then escaped with 31-year-old Anslow in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco,

The car was found dumped around ten miles from the scene of the ambush. It is believed the gang switched to a silver Mercedes.

The ambush took place on a narrow, secluded road in Tardebigge, just outside Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, shortly after the vehicle had left HMP Hewell Grange.

Two other prisoners in the van were not released.

Anslow, who is from the Tipton, was charged with the murder on January 18.

He is described as white, 5ft 10ins tall, of medium build, with short straight dark brown hair.

Detective Inspector Jon Marsden of West Mercia Police said: ‘Three men wearing balaclavas, two of whom were carrying sledgehammers, got out of a silver Volkswagen Scirocco, and smashed the windscreen and driver's window of the GEO Amey prison escort van.

‘The van driver was punched but no serious injuries were sustained by escort staff. The Scirroco drove off at speed. The group are believed to have switched to a silver Mercedes car in Stoney Lane, Bromsgrove, soon after.

Hewell prison houses more than 1,400 inmates across three blocks holding category B, C and D prisoners.

Det Insp Marsden added: ‘Anslow has 
recently been charged with murder and is considered dangerous.

'We are 
working closely with our colleagues from West Midlands and Staffordshire
Police forces and a large number of officers from all three forces are 
involved in the search for him.

'However we would urge any members of the
public who sees him not to approach him directly, but to contact police
immediately on 999.’

Killed: Anslow is charged with murder after Richard Deakin was shot dead in his bed

Police were still at the scene of the ambush this afternoon. The road was roped off with tape and helicopters could be seen circling the area.

A resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's like something out of a movie. Everybody is very worried at the moment.

'There's a murder suspect on the lose and we are a very small and tranquil community. We have never known anything like this.'

A spokeswoman for prisoner escort
firm GEO Amey said: 'Following an incident this morning, we can confirm
that two employees were threatened and one sustained facial injuries.

'Both were treated by paramedics at the scene.

'They continue to assist West Mercia Police with their investigations.'

Mr Deakin died after being shot twice while at home in Chasetown, Staffordshire, at about 8.30am on July 5, 2010.

His partner Megan had left the house to take their two daughters to school when the gunman struck.

It is believed Mr Deakin may been targeted for being a police informant - a claim that is refuted by detectives.

Officers made various appeals for information following his death, including a feature on the BBC’s Crimewatch programme and the offer of a £20,000 reward for information about his killing.

In December 2010 they also issued CCTV 
images of the skip hire boss’s suspected killer.

The dramatic footage showed the moments before the cold-blooded hitman, 
armed with the weapon in a plastic bag, stormed in to his home before 
shooting him dead.

In an earlier interview, Carol Deakin opened her heart over the anguish 
she and her family endure on a daily basis.

She said: 'Whoever was 
responsible, whoever is punished, it will never bring Richard back. If I
had one wish, it would be for Richard to be here today.

'We are normal people and this isn’t supposed to happen to normal 
people. I only ever saw this sort of thing on a film because we have 
never been surrounded by violence.

'You don’t get over it. You bury it and hope time will let you bury it 
further. This has ripped us all apart. He had two beautiful children who
adored him. They talk about him all the time.

Murder: Anslow is one of five men to be charged over the death of Mr Deakin

'They see stars in the night sky and say it’s their dad looking down on them.”

Darryl Dickens, 33, David Harrison, 62, and Andrew Hill, 49, and  Leigh Astbury, 31, have also been charged with Mr Deakin's murder.'

Anslow is the fourth prisoner to escape from custody in recent years. Last July, the trial of an alleged 
criminal gang which used guns and grenades to intimidate its rivals 
collapsed after two defendants escaped from a prison van on the edge of 
Manchester city centre.

The gang made off and an international search was launched for the two men, with ports and airports in the UK monitored.

And
in September 2006, a 'violent and dangerous' criminal escaped from a 
prison van in Redditch after being helped by two masked men armed with 
with a gun.

Two men wearing balaclavas, or with 
their faces covered, used a firearm to threaten staff in a security van 
taking the prisoner back to Blakenhurst prison following an appearance 
before magistrates in Redditch.
