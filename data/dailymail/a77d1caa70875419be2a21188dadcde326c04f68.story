More teens than ever are struggling to find work in the stubbornly sluggish American economy.

Less than 25 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds holds a job, down 10 per cent from just five years ago, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the lowest it has been since 1984.

With summer around the corner, teenagers might have a better chance at landing a seasonal job, though prospects are still shaky.

For those who think young: Less than 25 per cent of U.S. teens are currently employed, the lowest rate since 1984

On the lookout: One reason why teens may be struggling to find work is because older job seekers are taking jobs once filled by younger people

According to msnbc.com, around 40 to 50 per cent of teenagers across the U.S. held down a job throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

While the number was gently sloping downwards during the aughts, teenage employment took a steep plunge during the recession as others scrambled to fill what would normally be considered teenager’s jobs.

However, those aren’t the only reasons why more teens aren’t working.

Some teens – for whatever reason – are not actively seeking employment, while others have simply given up what they think is a fruitless search.

The search, to many, is disheartening, and a blow to many young workers’ resolve.

The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in nearly a year. The figure was a hopeful sign that hiring could pick up in coming months.

The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly unemployment aid applications fell 27,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 365,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, ticked up to 383,500 last week.

Applications are a measure of the pace of layoffs. When they fall below 375,000, it generally suggests that hiring will be strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.

Last month, applications jumped after steadily declining since the fall. At the same time, hiring slowed. Those figures sparked concerns that the job market was worsening after strong gains during the winter.

But some economists said temporary layoffs stemming from the spring holidays might have inflated benefit applications.

Last week's drop reversed the increase during April. Applications are now roughly back at their level four weeks ago.

‘There's no replacement for the dignity that comes with earning your first pay check,’ said Secretary of Labour Hilda Solis in a statement yesterday.

In 2011, the number of young people 
looking for but unable to find summer work increased by 745,000 to 4.1 
million in July, which is typically the peak of youth employment.

Also yesterday, the White House pledged to help lower-income youth find summer jobs in a move likely to appeal to younger voters crucial to President Obama's re-election campaign.

The initiative is in partnership with the cities of Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco and is meant to add 110,000 jobs, internships and mentorships to the 180,000 summer work opportunities for 16-24 year olds that Mr Obama has promised to create for 2012.

Under the new program, companies such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Johnson & Johnson, and UBS, as well as non-profits and federal agencies such as the Department of Education will offer paying jobs as well as mentorships and other training programs.

Last summer marked the lowest rate of youth employment for the month of July since 1948, according to the labour bureau.

The problem is exacerbated by socioeconomic status – the children of unemployed parents or poor families are less likely to find work.

Andrew Sum, the Director of the Centre for Labour Market Studies at Northeastern University, told msnbc.com that the phenomenon is caused because many teens find work through word of mouth, often through friends and family.

Sharp increase: In 2011, unemployment for those aged 16-24 hovered around 17.4%; the number has only grown since

Spiking: According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, unemployment in teens and young adults is the highest it's been in decades

The odds are against them, he noted, in part because they may not have role models to look up to, or they may have other obligations, such as no access to public transportation or a car to get them to and from work.

He also found that teens were more likely to find a job if they already had one.

Jobs early in life serve more purpose than a pay check – oftentimes, it helps a teenager or young adult decide what they may want to spend the rest of their lives doing.

A low percentage of citizens in the labour force present a multitude of problems, including a drain on Social Security and tax revenues, as well as increasing income inequality, according to CNN Money.

The website also notes that the jobless numbers hurt U.S. growth in general.
