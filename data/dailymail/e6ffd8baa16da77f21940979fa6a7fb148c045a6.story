Prison: Graeme Gordon was jailed for abusing a 14-year-old girl he groomed over the internet and has also been struck off the nursing register

A children's hospital nurse who abused a 14-year-old schoolgirl he groomed on the internet has been struck off the nursing register.

Graeme Gordon, 36, was a trusted nurse at the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton, East Sussex, where he worked for nine years.

But he was jailed for three years and two months after a judge heard that he took a girl to a hotel where they spent the night and he sexually abused her.

Gordon's double life was revealed this week at a disciplinary hearing which banned him from working as a nurse.

He admitted three offences relating to sexual activity with a child under 16, grooming of a child for the purposes of sexual activity and possession of indecent images relating to children when he appeared at Reading Crown Court earlier this year.

He has now been struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council's register after the panel concluded his fitness to practice had been impaired.

An investigation into his crimes by Thames Valley Police found no evidence he had carried out any criminal activity at his work.

The 14-year-old involved was not a patient at the hospital.

Gordon, formerly of Brighton, was sacked by Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust immediately after his arrest.

He was not present at the conduct and competence committee meeting of the Nursing and Midwifery Council on Friday.

The panel heard he is a prisoner at Bullingdon prison in Bicester, Oxfordshire.

The panel concluded: 'Mr Gordon's actions were significant departures from the standards expected of a registered nurse and are fundamentally incompatible with him remaining on the register.

'The panel was of the view that the findings in this particular case demonstrate that Mr Gordon's actions were serious and to allow him to continue practising would undermine public confidence in the profession and in the Nursing and Midwifery Council as a regulatory body.'

Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Chief executive Matthew Kershaw said: 'As soon as we received news of the charges against him we dismissed him from our employment.

'The police found absolutely no evidence or even suggestion that Graeme Gordon's offending behaviour involved his place of work.

'They also found no evidence that any of his colleagues were aware of his offending behaviour, they received no complaints about his work and there was no history or suggestion of previous offences.

'At the time of his arrest we informed all the appropriate authorities.'
