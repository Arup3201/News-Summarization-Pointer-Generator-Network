The United Nations has demanded that Burmese leaders condemn a Buddhist monk who called a visiting envoy a 'bitch' and 'whore' because she criticised curbs on religious conversions.

Firebrand cleric Ashin Wirathu made the comments at a public rally last week when he described human rights expert Yanghee Lee as a 'whore in our country'.

Ms Lee had previously said draft legislation including curbs on interfaith marriage, religious conversion and birth rates, would be a further sign that Burma was 'backtracking' in its democratic reforms if passed by parliament.

Now Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called the language used by Wirathu as 'utterly unacceptable' and demanded he be condemned.

He said: 'I call on religious and political leaders in Myanmar to unequivocally condemn all forms of incitement to hatred including this abhorrent public personal attack.

'It's intolerable for UN Special Rapporteurs to be treated in this way,' before adding that the language he used was 'sexist' and 'insulting.'

During the rally last week, Wirathu stood on a stage and shouted to loud applause as he hit out at Ms Lee.

He told the crowd: 'We have explained about the race protection law, but the bitch (Lee) criticised the laws without studying them properly.

'Don't assume that you are a respectable person because of your position. For us, you are a whore.'

His speech generated a flurry of comments on social media, with many people expressing shock at his language.

But earlier this week, the monk, who has been accused of fanning religious tensions, said he stood by his comments.

He explained: 'That was the harshest word (I could think of), so I used it.

'If I could find a harsher word, I would have used it. It is nothing compared to what she did to our country.'

New found freedom of expression has accompanied predominantly Buddhist Burma's transition from a half-century of military rule in 2011.

It lifted the lid on deep-seated prejudice against members of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, and those seen as defending them.

Most of Myanmar's 1.3 million Rohingya live under apartheid-like conditions in Rakhine state.

Denied citizenship by national law, they have limited access to adequate healthcare and education, and face restrictions on movement. More than 100,000 have fled the country in the last two years.

Wirathu has been accused of inciting violence with hate-filled, anti-Islam rhetoric that has left hundreds of people dead since 2012 and which has forced hundreds of thousands more to flee their homes, most of them Rohingya in Rakhine state.
