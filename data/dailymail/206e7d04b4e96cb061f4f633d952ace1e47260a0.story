Tory MP Adam Afriyie has described the racist abuse that he suffered while growing up on a rough council estate in London

Rebel Tory MP Adam Afriyie has told how he was called a ‘n****r’ and a ‘monkey’ on the rough London estate where he grew up. 

Mr Afriyie, the party’s first black MP, said he was regularly ‘spat at and sworn at for being black’ as a youngster in the Peckham area of  South-East London. 

The comments come in an interview and photoshoot for a glossy political magazine to be published later this week.

Mr Afriyie’s remarks will be seen as the latest move by the ambitious, multi-millionaire MP, who regards himself as a potential successor to David Cameron.  

His profile has rocketed since his leadership plan was revealed by The Mail on Sunday earlier this year, although Mr Afriyie, 47, himself denies any such ambitions,  

In the interview with Total Politics magazine, he is pictured on the front cover in a carefully choreographed pose with eyes closed.

The headline reads: ‘Adam Afriyie. Is he dreaming of being PM?’

The MP, whose mother is white and whose father came from Ghana, tells how he was the victim of racist abuse while growing up in Peckham in the Seventies and Eighties.

‘I remember being spat at and sworn at in the street – often with my mother, as a seven-year-old, for being black,’ he says.

‘It was quite common to be grumbled at on public transport and to be called a monkey or n****r.’
In the interview, Mr Afriyie tells 
fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson how he developed a ‘second skin’ to cope with 
the abuse, adding: ‘Thank goodness society has moved on.’

But he says he still regards himself as ‘a bit of an outsider – certainly not part of the establishment’.

Mr Afriyie is to participate in the Common's budget debate and argues that this is the last one that can deliver growth before the 2015 election

However, the MP makes it clear he does not see himself as a representative of black people in general. ‘I start businesses, I do stuff,’ he says. ‘If people out there are encouraged I’m the first black Conservative MP, I’m really happy about that.’

Mr Afriyie insists he has ‘no desire’ to become Prime Minister, saying: ‘David Cameron is Prime Minister and he’s doing a good job in incredibly difficult circumstances.’ 

But he does betray an interest in Downing Street dating from childhood. ‘We [Mr Afriyie and his brother] would sometimes go to No 10 Downing Street and see what was going on and I remember when Harold Wilson came out and waved at us,’ he recalls.

This week, the IT entrepreneur, worth up to £100 million, will step up his campaign to kick-start the economy with lower taxes by speaking in the Budget debate. 

In the interview, Mr Afriyie argues that this is the last Budget statement that can deliver growth before the 2015 Election, with temporary cuts in capital gains tax one of his key demands. But the MP, who has not so far served in the Coalition, denies he is angling for a Ministerial job. 

‘I’m genuinely not ambitious for any particular position and never have been,’ he says. ‘I’m concerned about the Conservative Party, that it’s united and able to win elections.’
