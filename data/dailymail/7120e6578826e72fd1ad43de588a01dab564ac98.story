Rio Ferdinand believes Wayne Rooney's appointment as Manchester United captain will spur him on to break records for club and country.

The 28-year-old was given the skipper's armband by Louis van Gaal at the start of the season, following the summer departure of Nemanja Vidic to Inter Milan.

Rooney sits fourth in the club's all-time goalscoring record charts behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Jack Rowley with 219 goals.

During his 10 years at Old Trafford he has won 12 major trophies and former Unied team-mate Ferdinand believes his achievements at the Theatre of Dreams meant he was the natural heir to take over from Vidic.

'Wayne's record demanded that he wears the Manchester United armband,' he told the Manchester Evening News. 'He deserves it.'

'Wayne has things to reach for still and the captaincy is another responsibility that will help him to get to those landmarks quicker.'

Rooney was also appointed England captain by Roy Hodgson following Steven Gerrard's international retirement after this summer's World Cup.

Rooney's matchwinning goal against Estonia in the Three Lions' Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday, moves him within five goals of Charlton's all-time England goalscoring record of 49.

Ferdinand also thinks that the responsibility of leading his country will push Rooney on further.

'He has been successful and won so many things but he still has things to hit and landmarks to reach. I think being given the captaincy for club and country will give him that extra push to get there,' he added.
