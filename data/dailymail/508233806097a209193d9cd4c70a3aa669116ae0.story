'Still life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' could raise up to £30million in a Sotheby's auction this autumn

A 'beautiful and poignant' still life painted by Vincent Van Gogh just weeks before his suicide is expected to fetch up to £30million when it goes on auction this autumn.

'Still life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies' has been described as the most important painting of its kind to go on the market in two decades.

It was produced by the Dutch artist in 1890 at the house of his close friend Dr. Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise, Paris - not long before he shot himself in the chest with a revolver, aged 37.

Van Gogh painted just a few hundred works in his career, the majority of which are now displayed in museums.

The painting will be sold by auction house Sotheby's in New York on November 4.  

Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's, described the work as 'beautiful' and 'vibrant', capturing 'the intensity of the artist at the height of his mania, only weeks before his tragic end.'

He said the Dutch artist's early death meant his works were in 'radically diminished supply'. 

He added: 'Unlike Monet and Picasso, who were very productive artists with long, prolific careers, Van Gogh only painted for a very short time.'

The artist is believed to have suffered from bipolar disorder, where manic episodes of high energy and creativity succumbed to spells of depression.

Mr Shaw describes the painting as 'particularly poignant' because Van Gogh picked the flowers for the picture from the meadows where he is thought to have shot himself the following month. 

Van Gogh was constantly broke and relied on his brother for funds and supplies of paint, brushes and canvas.  

The painting is thought to have been first owned by Dr Gachet, to whom Van Gogh offered it as payment in kind for his treatment.

It later became one of the first of his works to arrive in the US in the 1920s and was gifted to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. 

Sotheby's said the painting is being sold from 'an important European collection' which had held the picture for more than two decades.

Van Gogh's portrait of his friend and physician Dr. Gachet still holds the auction record for the most expensive Van Gogh painting, having sold at Christie's New York in May 1990 for more than £50million.

Other significant Van Gogh works that have raised huge sums at auction include 'L'Arlésienne, Madame Ginoux' which fetched around £25million in 2006.
