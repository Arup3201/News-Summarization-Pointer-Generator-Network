Rachelle Friedman, who became known as 'The Paralyzed Bride' in 2010 after a tragic accident at her own bachelorette party, has opened up about how she and her husband are trying to have a baby via surrogate.

The 28-year-old, who is paralyzed from the chest down, told xoJane that welcoming a new little member into their family 'is the final piece to our happiness, so I really hope this happens for us.'

As such, she and husband Chris have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations.

Hopeful: The couple have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations. 'It is the final piece to our happiness so I really hope this happens for us,' she said

'I see baby announcements flooding my 
Facebook timeline on a regular basis, and it makes my baby alarm clock 
go off every time I see a new one,' she confessed.

'It's hard not to feel envy for how easy 
it will likely be... for all of my girlfriends 
to have kids and be active moms.Â 

'I don't know how I'll handle it when 
that time comes, but I will tell you I'm moving towards being a mother 
myself,' she revealed.

The Raleigh, North Carolina native explained that while she is still biologically able to have children in her condition, her medications would be harmful to a fetus.

Staying strong: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted on Monday, appealing to her followers: 'Help me complete my happiness'

In order not to take any chances, 'I am having to consider 
alternate methods,' she wrote.

According to her fundraising page, the total cost of surrogacy is about $120,000, but an organization called Surrogacy Together is helping them reach that amount.

Mrs Friedman is also coming out with a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship, in May, which will delve into her life before and after she became paralyzed.

Tragic accident: She became paralized in 2010, when she was at her bachelorette party with her four bridesmaids. One of them pushed her into a too-shallow pool, and she broke her neck upon impact

Forgiveness: Instead of harboring any resentment, however, Mrs Friedman chose to keep the bridesmaid's name secret from the press and still counts her as a close friend

The accident occurred in 2010, just weeks before her wedding, when the bride-to-be was at her own bachelorette party with her four bridesmaids.

When the girls decided to take a dip in the hotel pool one night, one of them pushed her in and she fell too close to the shallow end.

'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.

Instead of resenting her friend, however, Mrs Friedman chose to keep her name secret from the press, in order to prevent them from hounding her and making her feel guiltier than she already did.

'She is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is something she never once questioned.

'I want a child more than anything. Help me complete my happiness'

'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that she's a human being.'

She also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood.

'I feel very grateful to have her support and love,' she wrote.
