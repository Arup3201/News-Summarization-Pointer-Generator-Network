Fired: Brian Lewis worked for Fox News as CEO Roger Ailes' right hand man and was escorted from the networks headquarters on Tuesday after he was fired

A top Fox News executive was fired following a bitter fall-out with channel president Roger Ailes that had been brewing 'for more than a year', according to sources today.

Brian Lewis, the executive VP of corporate communications, was escorted from his office and fired after an investigation into 'financial irregularities'.

Mr Lewis, widely considered to be Mr Ailes' right-hand man and chief advisor, had worked alongside the Fox News Channel since the network was founded 17 years ago.

However, in a statement yesterday, Fox News reported that he was found to be in breach of contract.

And a source told MailOnline today: 'This is connected to a falling out between Brian and Roger that has been brewing for more than a year, my sense is that it's over money.

'I know there was a salary negotiation dispute.'

Meanwhile, New York Times writer Bill Carter backed up this theory, as he claimed a senior Fox executive had told him the relationship between Mr Ailes and Mr Wilson had 'soured badly within the last year or so,' adding: 'This has been coming for a long time.

'They have not been close for a long time. I have known this was coming.'

Mr Carter added: 'The executive said that Mr. Lewis, who for most of the existence of Fox News occupied an office just down the hall from Mr. Ailes, had within the last year been moved to another floor. “It had gotten really nasty and acrimonious between the two of them,” the executive said.

Today, Brian Lewis to say it had been an 'honor and privilege to work for Roger Ailes' and said he could not talk about the reason for his sacking 'for legal reasons'.

He told mediabistro's TV Newser that he was upset by the speculation over his dismissal, saying: 'Some stories are ludicrous'.

Mr Lewis began work at Fox News headquarters in New York in 1996, six months before the powerful network launched to air and was made an executive VP in 2006.

But his role was terminated three weeks ago, although Fox News did not announce his departure publicly until Tuesday afternoon, releasing a statement that said: 'After an extensive internal investigation of Brian Lewis' conduct by Fox News, it was determined that he should be terminated for cause, specifically for issues relating to financial irregularities, as well as for multiple, material and significant breaches of his employment contract.

'He was terminated for cause on July 25.'

Brian Lewis acted as a spokesperson and trusted lieutenant at Fox News for Mr Ailes, 73, who was handpicked by Rupert Murdoch to helm the fledgling news channel.

While the exact reasons for Lewis' firing are not known, witnesses said that it was sufficient enough for him to be escorted out of the door from Fox News headquarters in Manhattan's Midtown according to The Hollywood Reporter.

On Monday, Lewis was still listed as an executive on the Fox New website and his accomplishments were listed as, 'Launching the Fox News Channel to overwhelming consumer awareness, creating and implementing successful campaigns favorably positioning FNC against competing networks and corporations, and handling all crisis situations that have threatened the network.'

As of Tuesday, this had been taken down.

Fox News was embarrassed last month after Fox host Geraldo Rivera, 70, tweeted a very revealing nude self-portrait.

The bombastic broadcaster captioned 
the picture '70 is the new 50', before admitting that he might embarrass
his wife and family.

Rivera deleted the shot hours later, but the damage had been done.

The photo spread instantly round the 
internet with users expressing differing levels of disgust and 
admiration for the physique of a 70-year-old man.
