Popular senator Nick Xenophon is now looking to broaden his appeal by copying Clive Palmer and launching his own political party to field candidates at the next Federal election.

The South Australian Independent is reportedly in discussions with some high-profile candidates to stand alongside him for the Senate.

His party is set to be called the Nick Xenophon Team, or NXT. He said his reason for forming the party was because of the lack of trust the public had in politicians today in Australia.

'Voters are also sick of parties that promise one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards,' Senator Xenophon said. 

But he pledged not to take any current Independent senators into the NXT with him, including former Palmer United Party member Jacqui Lambie.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Xenophon felt Australians didn't feel like the major parties are looking out for them anymore.

'For too long the major parties have created serious voter disengagement,' he said.

'They’ve listened too much to cashed-up unions and wealthy corporations. Australians just don’t feel like the major parties are looking out for them.

'I will try and find like-minded people, to run in every state and territory, who share the same commonsense approach to politics and, at the next federal election, we will ask the Australian voters to give us their support.'

Mr Xenophon wants the Australian public to start trusting politicians again 

Senator Xenophon wasn't unduly worried about funding either, saying he would fund his new party through micro-donations, 'almost like crowd sourcing'.
