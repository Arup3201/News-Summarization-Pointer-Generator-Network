A British grandmother has avoided the death penalty – but faces 15 years in a Bali jail for drug-running.

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, has been spared execution because of her age and for her co-operation with authorities on the holiday isle.

They also rewarded her good behaviour. She is expected to be sentenced by three judges on January 3.

Sandiford is one of ‘the British gang of four’ who were linked by customs officials and police after the grandmother tried to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine into the country from Thailand last May.

courtrooms yesterday)

The usual sentence for the amount of cocaine found in the lining of her suitcase – 4.8kg – is execution and sources claimed judges still have the right to impose that penalty.

Also facing an uncertain future is former antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43, from Brighton, whose court hearing is expected to take place in the weeks following Sandiford’s case in January.

But there was relief for Ponder’s partner, Rachel Dougall, the 39-year-old mother of their six-year-old daughter, when she received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court yesterday.

She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be reunited with her daughter, because she has already been in jail for eight months awaiting trial.

Nervous wait: Prosecutors on the holiday island of Bali said they would ask for 15 years jail for the 56-year-old because of her co-operation in a major drug smuggling case, but it is up to three judges

Caught: Despite Mrs Sandiford allegedly 'coming clean' and telling police who her contacts were, officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects

Hiding: Sandiford, 56, from Teesside, was stopped
at Bali Airport with 4.8kg of cocaine worth £1.6 million before being

covered her face with a cloth

Lawyer Ari Soenardi said he would press for Dougall to be released on parole next month.

On Wednesday, 39-year-old Briton Paul Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a heavy penalty when judges sentenced him to four years for possession of a small amount of hashish.

Police originally said the four Britons faced death because of the amount of cocaine involved – but as the investigation continued, their case began to crumble.

Despite Sandiford allegedly ‘coming clean’ and telling police who her contacts were, officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects.

Jailed: During Miss Dougall's trial which ended yesterday, charges of possession of cocaine were dropped and instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug

Spared: 39-year-old Briton Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was spared a heavy sentence when the judges convicted him for possession of a small amount of hashish

Beales, right, was imprisoned for four years for his role in the plot

Dougall and Ponder insisted that they believed a gift-wrapped package of drugs Sandiford took to their house – watched by police who insisted she go through with her delivery instructions – was a birthday present for their daughter.

Although police did find drugs at the villa, it was a relatively small amount – 25g of cocaine hidden in a cigarette packet.

It is understood from sources  close to the police that all  alleged conversations that took  place between Dougall and Sandiford – including one when Dougall gave the grandmother instructions on where and when to deliver the contraband – were carried out through mobile phones.

Paraded: Three Britons, Beales, Dougall and Ponder, and an Indian national were seen dressed in ill-fitting orange outfits and flip-flops after their arrests in May

Arrests: Sandiford was detained at Denpasar Airport on the paradise island of Bali, Indonesia

But investigators failed to retrieve any SIM card during the raid on  Dougall’s villa.

As for the cocaine found in  the cigarette packet, Ponder admitted during an earlier hearing that  it was his.

Charges of possession of cocaine against Dougall were dropped. Instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug – a much lesser offence.

For Dougall and Beales, their  relatively light jail sentences will come as a relief after Sandiford  told police that she had met both of them in Bangkok before she took the flight to Bali.

She said Beales placed the drugs in the lining of her suitcase and that Dougall was the owner of the drugs, a claim both denied.

Sandiford claims that her son in the UK had been threatened with reprisals if she did not agree to carry the drugs into Bali.

Indonesia's drug scene is seen as something of a contradiction - as there is relatively high levels of illegal drug use and some of the strictest laws against them.

The Indonesian authorities are ready to make an example of foreigners who use illegal drugs in their jurisdiction, with Bali's Kerobokan Prison housing plenty of non-Indonesians.

Divided into three groups, category 1 drugs are recognised as 'therapeutically useless with a high potential for causing addiction'.

They include cocaine and heroin. Sentences are the most strict - with life imprisonment for possession, and the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers.

Group 2 drugs, such as morphine and methadone, are seen as 'useful for therapeutic purposes, but dangerous due to their high addictive potential'.

Possession is punishable by 3 to 10 years' imprisonment, and fines of around £40,000 to £400,000.

Trafficking is punishable by 4 to 12 years' imprisonment and £60,000 to £600,000 fines.

Group 3 drugs, such as codeine, are seen as 'therapeutically useful and moderately addictive'.

Possession is punishable by 2 to 7 years' imprisonment, and a fine of £30,000 to £280,000. While trafficking is punishable by 3 to 10 years and fine of £40,000 to £400,000.
