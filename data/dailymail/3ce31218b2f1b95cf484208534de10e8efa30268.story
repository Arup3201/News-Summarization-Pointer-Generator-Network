A grand jury indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Friday for allegedly abusing the powers of his office by carrying out a threat to veto funding for state prosecutors investigating public corruption – making the possible 2016 presidential hopeful his state's first indicted governor in nearly a century.

A special prosecutor spent months calling witnesses and presenting evidence that Perry broke the law when he promised publicly to nix $7.5 million of state budget funds earmarked to run the public integrity unit run by the office of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg.

Lehmberg, a Democrat, was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013, but refused Perry's demand for her resignation after a judge handed down a sentence of 45 days in jail and a $4,000 fine. She served about half of her sentence and refused to step down.

If she had resigned, Perry, a Republican, would have appointed her replacement – effectively taking over an office that has been run by Democrats for decades.

A Texas grand jury indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Friday on charges that he abused his position in a 2013 tussle over his state's Public Integrity Unit, headed by a Democratic official who was convicted of drunk driving

Rosemary Lehmberg was sentenced to 45 days in jail for DUI, about half of which she served before her release, and was ordered to pay a $4,000 fine

Though the Republican governor now faces two felony indictments, politics dominates the case.

Lehmberg is based in Austin, which is 
heavily Democratic, in contrast to most of the rest of fiercely 
conservative Texas. The grand jury was comprised of Austin-area 
residents.

The unit Lehmberg oversees investigates statewide allegations of corruption and political wrongdoing, working from the state's most liberal county.

Her office led the investigation against former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican who in 2010 was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering for taking part in a scheme to influence elections in his home state.

Those convictions were later vacated by an appeals court in a 2-1 decision led by two Republicans. Delay never served his three-year prison sentence, since his bail was continued pending appeals.

Lehmberg's office has since demanded a judicial review to reinstate the conviction.

She waived her right to appeal her own DUI conviction as part of the 2013 guilty plea that set Perry's wheels in motion.

Along with other high-profile 
Republicans, Perry argued that Lehmberg should resign after her humiliating and high-profile arrest and conviction.

A
 video recording made at the jail showed Lehmberg shouting at staffers 
to call the sheriff, kicking the door of her cell and sticking her 
tongue out.

Her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit for driving. Officers ultimately had to strap her into a specialized 'restraint chair' for her own safety.

Jailhouse video showed that when officers told Lehmberg that she had been arrested for driving drunk, she shot back, 'That's y'all's problem, not mine.'

'Y'all are gonna be in jail, not me,' an intoxicated Lehmberg insisted when deputies removed her jewelry during the booking process.

Eight months later, the Travis County Attorney's Office sued her in civil court to remove her from her job. Judge David Peeples, visiting from a nearby county – every jurist in Travis County had a conflict of interest – ruled in her favor.

If prosecutors were to be removed from office for drunkenness, Peeples declared from the bench, officials had 'better get busy' impeaching officials all over the county and state.

Liberals statewide cheered the outcome, including gay-rights advocates who saw the confrontation through the lens of identity politics.

Lehmberg is openly gay, and Perry championed a 2005 Texas constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

Jailhouse footage showed an intoxicated Lehmberg arguing with officers and threatening that they would wind up in jail for 'ruining my career'

After Lehmberg repeatedly kicked the door of her holding cell and verbally abused officers, they strapped her into a 'restraint chair' and later covered her face with a 'spit mask'

Perry stands accused of abusing his office by warning that he would veto funding for the Public Integrity Unit, which Lehmberg (L) runs. The governor made his threat in an attempt to get Lehmberg to resign following her drunk driving conviction (booking photo at right) in 2013

Mary Anne Wiley, Perry's general counsel, predicted on Friday that the governor will be cleared of the charges against him – abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant.

'The
 veto in question was made in accordance with the veto authority 
afforded to every governor under the Texas Constitution,' she said.

Perry issued a public statement along with his veto, writing in June 2013 that '[d]espite the otherwise good work [of] the Public Integrity Unit’s employees, I cannot in good conscience support continued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the public’s confidence.'

David
 L. Botsford, Perry's defense attorney, whose $450-per hour fees are 
being paid for by state funds, said Friday that he was outraged by the indictment.

'This
 clearly represents political abuse of the court system and there is no 
legal basis in this decision,' Botsford said in a statement.

'Today's
 action, which violates the separation of powers outlined in the Texas 
Constitution, is nothing more than an effort to weaken the 
constitutional authority granted to the office of Texas governor, and 
sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the 
exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas 
governor.'

Several top aides to Perry appeared before grand jurors, including his deputy chief of staff, legislative director and general counsel. Perry himself was not called to testify.

Abuse of official capacity is a first-degree felony with potential punishments of five to 99 years in prison. Coercion of a public servant is a third-degree felony that carries a punishment of two to 10 years.

In office since 2000 and already the longest-serving governor in Texas history, Perry isn't seeking re-election in November.

Lehmberg was arrested in April 2013 for drunk driving and sentenced to 45 days in jail after she failed field sobriety tests (above) and tests showed her blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit

Lehmberg refused to step down after her conviction, despite Perry's demand, and the governor followed through on a threat to veto state funding for the 'public integrity' prosecution division she heads

When he ran for president in 2012, 
Perry plummeted from brief front-runner to national punchline, his once 
promising campaign doomed by a series of embarrassing gaffes.

His most infamous 'Oops' moment came during a primary debate when he couldn't remember which three cabinet-level federal agencies he had promised to abolish if he were to win the White House.

As
 he eyes another run, Perry has re-made his cowboy image, 
donning stylish glasses, studying up on foreign and domestic affairs and
 promising conservatives nationally that he's far more humble this time 
around.

Political 
observers say the indictment may not immediately hurt his standing with 
Republican primary voters – but Democrats didn't miss a change to gloat 
Friday.

Texans deserve 
real leadership and this is unbecoming of our governor,' Texas 
Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. He 
demanded that Perry immediately resign.

Ray Sullivan, a former Perry chief of staff who took on spokesman duties during the 2012 presidential primary season, told the Austin American-Statesman that Friday's indictment 'certainly will be a big deal with the liberal media – Slate, Salon – and therefore for the national media.'

'It is beyond ridiculous,' Sullivan said, 'that Travis County is pursuing the governor, after letting the seriously drunk, police-disrespecting DA stay in office.'

No one disputes that Perry is allowed to veto measures approved by the state legislature.

But the liberal Texans for Public Justice government watchdog group filed an ethics complaint accusing the governor of coercion because he threatened to use his veto – before actually doing so – in an attempt to pressure Lehmberg to quit.

Almost immediately after news of his indictment broke, Gov. Perry continued putting out red-meat messages for his conservative Twitter audience, continuing to send signals about a potential presidential run in 2016

'We're pleased that the grand jury 
determined that the governor's bullying crossed the line into illegal 
behavior,' said Craig McDonald, executive director of Texans for Public 
Justice.

'The complaint had merit, serious laws were potentially broken.'

Michael
 McCrum, the San Antonio-based special prosecutor, said he 'took into 
account the fact that we're talking about a governor of a state – and a 
governor of the state of Texas, which we all love.'

'Obviously that carries a lot of importance,' McCrum said. 'But when it gets down to it, the law is the law.'

McCrum
 said he'll meet with Botsford on Monday to discuss when he will come to
 the courthouse to be arraigned.

McCrum said he doesn't know when Perry 
will be booked.

Although McCrum called more than 40 witnesses before the grand jury, Perry was not among them – a decision likely to add to a fast-growing controversy.

'That's prosecutorial discretion that I had,' he told the Associated Press on Friday.

McCrum's control of the Perry grand jury became another political hot potato when he was named to the post: President Barack Obama had nominated him to serve as a federal prosecutor, but he withdrew his name from consideration after 11 months had passed without the U.S. Senate taking action to confirm him.

Perry's indictment is the first of its kind since 1917, when James 'Pa' Ferguson was indicted on charges stemming from his veto of state funding to the University of Texas in an effort to unseat faculty and staff members he objected to.

Ferguson was eventually impeached, then resigned before being convicted.
