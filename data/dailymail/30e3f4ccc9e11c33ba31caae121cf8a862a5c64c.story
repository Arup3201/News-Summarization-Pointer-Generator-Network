For hundreds of years the Mayans dominated large parts of the Americas until, mysteriously in the 8th and 9th century AD, a large chunk of the Mayan civilisation collapsed.

The reason for this collapse has been hotly debated, but now scientists say they might have an answer - an intense drought that lasted a century.

Studies of sediments in the Great Blue Hole in Belize suggest a lack of rains caused the disintegration of the Mayan civilisation, and a second dry spell forced them to relocate elsewhere.

Research co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides new evidence for the drought theory of the Mayan collapse. The research suggests that a sharp decline of the Mayans around 900 AD was due to a drought - while a second coincided with the fall of Chichén Itzá (shown) in 1000 AD

The theory that a drought led to a decline of the Mayan Classic Period is not entirely new, but the new study co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides fresh evidence for the claims.

The Classic Period refers to the time from 300 to 900 AD in Mesoamerica - a region that extends from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala and northern Costa Rica.

During this time the Mayans built a number of monuments, on which they recorded dates. 

In 514 they were building around ten per year, rising to about 40 per year in 750.

But following this, the numbers began to decline quickly; by 900, no monuments were being built.

Dozens of theories have attempted to explain the Classic Maya Collapse, from epidemic diseases to foreign invasion.

This latest theory, though, adds fuel to the idea that climate change was the reason.

Previous research has found that periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between AD 300 and 660.

Professor Douglas Kennett, from Pennsylvania State University, and his research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in Belize, less than one mile (1.6km) from the Maya site of Uxbenka in Belize and about 18 miles (29km) from three other important centers.

Using oxygen isotope dating in 0.004-inch (0.1mm) increments along the length of the stalagmite, the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years.

Combined, the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics.

They say a climate reversal and drying trend between 660 and 1000 AD triggered political competition, increased warfare, overall sociopolitical instability, and finally, political collapse - known as the Classic Maya Collapse.

This was followed by an extended drought between AD 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures, death, famine, migration and, ultimately, the collapse of the Maya population. 

The reason for the Classic Maya Collapse in 900 AD has been hotly debated. But the evidence from the Great Blue Hole in Belize (shown) suggests less rain led to famines and civil unrest. Sediements at the bottom of the 407ft (124m) deep hole provide a geological record of the past

Dr Droxler’s research involved drilling cores from sediments in the Great Blue Hole, a vast circular sinkhole off the coast of Belize that is 984 feet (300m) across and 407ft (124m) deep.

The hole formed tens of thousands of years ago when sea levels were much lower, being filled as the oceans began to rise.

Ongoing sedimentation at the base of the hole allows scientists to study periods from history.

When there are storms or extremely wet periods, more sediments are deposited at the bottom of the lagoon.

But less rainfall can also be accounted for, in particular due to the ratio of titanium to aluminium in cores taken from the sediment.

A lower ratio of titanium to aluminium corresponds to dryer periods.

‘It’s like a big bucket. It’s a sediment trap,’ Dr Droxler told Live Science.

The Classic Period refers to the time from 300 to 900 AD in Mesoamerica - a region that extends from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala and northern Costa Rica. Following the drought, the Mayans relocated to parts of the northern Yucatan Peninsula (shown)

With his team he found that from 800 to 1000 AD, no more than two tropical cyclones occurred every two decades, when usually there were up to six.

This suggests major droughts occurred in these years, possibly leading to famines and unrest among the Mayan people. 

And they also found that a second drought hit from 1000 to 1100 AD, corresponding to the time that the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá collapsed. 

The research adds to previous evidence that suggested decreased rainfall coincided with a decline of Mayan culture.

And it may help finally solve the mystery of why the Mayans disappeared in parts of Mesoamerica a thousand years ago.
