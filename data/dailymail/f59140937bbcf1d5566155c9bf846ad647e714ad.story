A young female doctor has bravely penned a blog post exposing the daily sexism she faces within the medical industry and admits she's scared she will now lose her job for going public.

Melbourne doctor Ashleigh Witt  revealed in the online post the varying degrees of sexual harassment she and other women have experienced following a Sydney surgeon's controversial comments last week.

Vascular surgeon Dr Gabrielle McMullin suggested young women in the field should 'just accept unwanted sexual advances' because sexism was so rife among doctors.

She was referring to a woman named Caroline who won a case against a doctor accused of sexually assaulting her, but was then unable to get work at any public hospital.

Dr Witt admits she is concerned her career could be jeopardised by  her decision to speak out about sexism

'Her career was ruined by this one guy asking for sex on this night. And, realistically, she would have been much better to have given him a blow job on that night,' Dr McMullin told ABC radio on Friday.

Dr Witt said in her blog post the Sydney surgeon wasn't the problem. 

'She is simply the messenger. The problem here is a system where reporting sexual harassment is vehemently discouraged,' she wrote.

The Melbourne-based trainee doctor, who describes herself as a moderately pretty blonde, said medicine's secret catchphrase was: 'Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine.' 

'We all have stories about sexual harassment at work - some of them subtle, some of them shocking. And yet person after person (mostly men, although I can't imagine why), have stood up and said sexual harassment is not a problem in medicine.

'Perhaps we aren't understanding what sexual harassment is. Perhaps we're associating it with only the extreme example of rape, when it encompasses so much more than unwanted physical touching,' Dr Witt said.

She then went on to list the varying degrees of sexism she has faced. 

'Sexual harassment is every time you call me 'blondie' or 'barbie', every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a 'lady doctor' instead of a 'doctor'.

'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said 'they shouldn't send you up here, you're too clucky'.

'It's the consultant who commented that I'd 'obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty'.

'It's the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.'

Ms Wit wrote in her blog that a surgical registrar told her if she  wanted to be taken seriously  she should dye her hair dark
