The first commercial round-trips to Mars will blast off within 10 years, according to PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, CEO of U.S commercial rocket maker SpaceX.

The trip will cost a cool $500,000 (£300,000) - entirely payable through PayPal, no doubt.

In 2010, SpaceX became the first commercial company in history to launch a spacecraft into orbit and retrieve it, and has partnered with Nasa to carry out cargo deliveries to the International Space Station.

Red alert: SpaceX is confident it can take paying passengers to Mars within 10 years

SpaceX launched its Dragon spacecraft into orbit atop a Falcon 9 rocket on December 8, 2010

Musk told the BBC that he's confident his company will soon 
be able to go even further and send paying customers to the Red Planet, 
which lies around 140,000,000 miles away, possibly within 10 years - thanks to technology breakthroughs dramatically lowering the costs of space missions.

He said: ‘Land on Mars, a round-trip ticket - half a million dollars. It can be done.

‘My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars, so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there.

‘The whole system [must be] reusable - nothing is thrown away.'

At present, he said, the technologies needed to pull off such a grand venture haven't been patented, so he remained tight-lipped about the precise methods SpaceX would use.

But he added: ‘We will probably unveil the overall strategy later this year in a little more detail. I'm quite confident that it could work.’

At present SpaceX is preparing for a test flight in which it will attempt to send its Dragon spacecraft to the Space Station.

The unmanned craft was due to fly to the ISS on February 7 - carrying a payload of non-essential supplies in case of failure.

But this was postponed to allow for more engineering tests.

SpaceX's Dragon capsule will fly within two miles of the space station, for a checkout of all its systems.

Then it will close in, with station astronauts grabbing the capsule with a robotic arm. The Dragon ultimately will be released for a splashdown in the Pacific.

SpaceX has said that it aims for manned flights by 2014.
