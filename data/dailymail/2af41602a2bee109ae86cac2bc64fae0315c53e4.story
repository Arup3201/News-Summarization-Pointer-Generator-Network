Arsenal have enquired about Torino forward Alessio Cerci but face competition from Southampton.

Manager Ronald Koeman is making a late push to bring extra quality into his side after a couple of promising performances but poor results in the Premier League.

Italy striker Cerci has been a target for Everton and Atlletico Madrid this summer but he was reluctant to move to Goodison Park while Atletico thought he was too expensive at £15million.

Injury: Olivier Giroud could be out for three months so the Gunners are in the hunt for a new frontman

Koeman has already enquired about a deal for Atletico defender Toby Alderweireld and midfielder Jordy Clasie at Feyenoord but wants another option in attack.

Southampton have enquired about Nathan Redmond at Norwich and bid for Andros Townsend at Tottenham but Cerci would be a real coup if they could tempt him to the south coast. However, Arsenal would be the player's preference.

The Gunners are discussing options as they weigh up the extent of Olivier Giroud's injury.

They have missed out on Olympiacos defender Kostas Manolas who had a medical at Roma this morning before agreeing terms.

Roma see him as a replacement for Mehdi Benatia, who is joining Bayern Munich after the clubs agreed a fee of around £27m on Tuesday morning.

McArthur involved in tug-of-war 

Leicester City have had a £5million bid for James McArthur rejected by Wigan as Burnley prepare a new offer of their own.

The 26-year-old is happy at Wigan and pivotal to Uwe Rosler's plans despite the £4m signing of Adam Forshaw from Brentford.

However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche is keen to see if an improved bid can tempt Wigan into a sale. Crystal Palace and Cardiff also have an interest in McArthur.

Dyche will give debuts to Matt Gilks, Steven Reid and Stephen Ward at Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday night as he looks to test his squad ahead of their weekend clash with Manchester United. 

However, it is clear to Dyche that he needs two or three more players before Monday and he would prefer British-based players with Premier League experience if possible.

Wigan are also looking to bring in another defender and are close to signing a striker.

Dawson set to depart as Tottenham close in on Fazio 

Michael Dawson is due to have a medical ahead of his proposed £3.5million move to Hull City.

The 30-year-old knew his chances were limited at Tottenham who will now complete the signing of Federico Fazio from Sevilla for £8m.

Tottenham have been linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot but they will not be making a move for the 19-year-old.

Clough wants Maguire reunion 

Sheffield United have asked to take Harry Maguire back on loan from Hull. Manager Nigel Clough has also made enquiries to Leeds United about defender Jason Pearce but thinks that will prove beyond their budget.

Clough said: 'We’d always be open to the prospect of Harry coming back if the chance arose. It might be interesting to see how things develop with (Michael) Dawson and also, I would imagine, how they do in Europe and also the League Cup.'

Talking to the South Yorkshire Times, Clough added: 'We know (City manager) Steve Bruce well. He kicked me enough times when we were both players and get along.'

Ibe looks to follow in Sterling's footsteps via loan move 

Derby County are poised to sign Liverpool's highly-rated Jordon Ibe .

Bolton and numerous other Championship sides have been keen to take the teenager on loan but Liverpool trust Steve McClaren in the way he helps develop their players.

Andre Wisdom improved before joining West Brom and Ibe, tipped to follow a similar path to Raheem Sterling, is expected to make an impression on Liverpool's first team next season.

Ruiz too costly for Werder 

The proposed transfer of Fulham forward Bryan Ruiz to Werder Bremen is off after the German club tightened their purse strings.

General manager Thomas Eichin revealed: 'Actually it's impossible to sign Bryan Ruiz. The club is determined to keep up with the financial consolidation and get closer to achieving a black zero.'

Talking to German publication Kreiszeitung Syke, he added: 'That is why we are not talking about signing new players, we are just out for further departures.'

Bremen manager Robin Dutt added: 'It's no real news to me as we did not have money yesterday, we have no money now and we will likely have no money tomorrow.'

Holloway looks to capitalise on Blackpool uncertainty 

Ian Holloway is bringing Angel Martinez to Millwall. The manager knows the 28-year-old from his time at Blackpool where he made 62 appearances but, despite being offered a new deal by Jose Riga, former Spain U21 midfielder Martinez decided to keep his options open and is now poised to sign for  Millwall.

Blackpool coach Riga has held talks with chairman Karl Oyston as he wants more help building a competitive squad. The Championship strugglers have signed 18 players this summer, with more likely to follow.

Oyston is back from his family holiday and Riga said: 'I will never complain about my players but the situation has dictated who we sign. It’s more and more difficult now to get my original targets in. They aren’t sat around waiting for Blackpool. It was always going to be difficult to get these players and it’s even more difficult now.'

El Hadji Diouf and former Arsenal winger Quincy Owusu-Abeyie have been training at the club lately.

Benitez looking elsewhere after Lucas rejection 

Rafa Benitez is considering Espanyol defensive midfielder David Lopez after Liverpool blocked a loan move for Lucas Leiva.

Liverpool want a permanent deal and value the Brazilian at £6m to £8m while Napoli would prefer a loan partly to ensure Lucas is also fully recovered from his knee trouble.

Benitez has coolled his interest in Marouane Fellaini even though the Belgian will not be out for too long with his ankle injury.

Lopez is a stylish 6ft 1in midfielder who has impressed La Liga observers in the past year but may still be short of the quality Napoli really need. Tottenham's Sandro is liked by Benitez but too expensive at this stage.

Clayton heads to Denmark 

Max Clayton has taken the unusual step of going on trial at FC Midtjylland. The England U20 striker has already spent time this summer with Sunderland, Wolves and Bolton.

The Danish side have taken the 20-year-old on trial after striker Morten Duncan Rasmussen was ruled out for up to two months with a ligament injury.

Clayton is out of contract having rejected Crewe's offer of a three-year deal which has been on the table since November.

Odd move: Max Clayton is going on trial at FC Midtjylland but Andreas Cornelius will not be joining Newcastle

Newcastle have no interest in former Cardiff striker Andreas Cornelius. Although club scouts were present at a recent FC Copenhagen game in which the 21-year-old played, they will not be pursuing the 6ft 4ins striker who controversially cost Cardiff £8m and played only eight games.

Meanwhile, Hatem Ben Arfa played and scored for Newcastle reserves in their 5-2 win over Reading on Monday at Whitley Park. Alan Pardew and club managing director Lee Charnley were among the 400 spectators keen to see how the French midfielder, who is available for sale, shaped up.

Should Neil Warnock arrive as Crystal Palace manager, he remains keen on Sunderland striker Connor Wickham. The England U21 forward was an option for Tony Pulis prior to his departure. 

Sunderland will listen to offers as Wickham is not signing a new contract and has a year left. They want £8million as West Ham found out and are continuing their own search for a new striker.
