Exposed: Motorbike officer David Salsbury, 39, admitted exposing himself inside a supermarket, a corner shop and even his own police station

A former police officer has today admitted exposing himself inside a supermarket, a corner shop and even his own police station.

Motorbike officer David Salsbury, 39, deliberately exposed his genitals in a way likely to cause 'distress and alarm' to the public, a court heard.

Salsbury committed his first offence inside the police station in Brixham, Devon, on June 16, 2012 when he unzipped his police-issue leathers and exposed himself in the building’s lobby.

He then exposed himself again four months later on October 14, 2012 at a Co-op supermarket and on the same day at a convenience store while he was off-duty.

The court heard Salsbury was a serving officer in Devon and Cornwall Police when he carried out the three offences.

However, after his arrest in March last year he resigned from his job and his wife divorced him in September.

He initially claimed the exposures happened accidentally as he was adjusting his clothing and was due to stand trial at Exeter Crown Court today.

Instead he pleaded guilty to three charges of exposing himself in a way which was likely to cause alarm and distress, under section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

He denied a further allegation that he exposed himself at the Pets at Home shop at Newton Abbot on October 26, which is not being pursued by the prosecution and will lie on file.

At a previous hearing prosecutor Sonia Croft said: 'When he unzipped his motorbike leathers he did them all the way down.'

David Sapiecha, defending, today said 
that Salsbury may have committed the offences because of post traumatic 
stress disorder suffered as a result of his policing career.

He said admitting the offences had been 'the most difficult decision in his life'.

Mr Sapiecha: This was not a cynical attempt by him to 
avoid justice; it has been probably the most difficult decision of his 
life and one which he has had tremendous problems over.

'He has resigned from his position and is now divorced and is concerned with regard to contact with his children.

'There
 is evidence from his doctor that he has suffered from depression and 
post traumatic stress disorder with regard to events he witnessed and 
dealt with in his former position.'

Judge Jeremy Griggs adjourned sentence until May and ordered a psychological report.

The offences carry a maximum sentence of two years in jail.

'It’s unfortunate that he wasn’t able to come to that decision at an earlier stage,' said Judge Griggs after hearing Salsbury’s eleventh-hour guilty plea.

He told the defendant: 'It’s an unusual case. On your plea of guilty you have been convicted of the first three charges.'

Salsbury, of Kingskerswell, Devon, was released on unconditional bail ahead of sentencing on May 2.

A source said after the hearing: 'He has lost everything.'
