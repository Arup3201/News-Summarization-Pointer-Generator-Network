A British mining company has evacuated a number of 'non-essential' workers from Sierra Leone following an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the west African country.

London Mining said it imposed travel restrictions in the region around its Marampa mine and was closely monitoring the situation with health chiefs and international agencies.

The iron ore mining company said production at its mine was not affected.

Officials in the country say there have been five deaths from Ebola and a dozen other cases of the deadly and highly contagious disease, following an outbreak in neighbouring Guinea that also led to cases in Liberia earlier this year.

London Mining said: 'London Mining notes recent reports from Sierra Leone suggesting that an increased number of incidents of Ebola Fever have been found in the country.

'The company is not aware of any incidences of the disease among its workforce or in the communities surrounding the Marampa mine.

'However London Mining is regularly monitoring the situation with Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the World Health Organisation and other international agencies.

'Following consultation with the relevant authorities, the company has imposed restrictions on travel in the region and continues to work with employees to promote awareness of the disease, including the provision of information on how it is transmitted and the signs and symptoms.

'A number of non-essential personnel have left the country due to voluntary restrictions on non-essential travel.

'London Mining has also established proactive health monitoring of the workforce, including working with trained personnel to screen all staff and visitors entering our sites, and has ensured the

Marampa facility has the appropriate medication and equipment to manage any potential occurrences of the disease.

'Production at Marampa is not currently affected.'

Ebola causes a high fever and severe bleeding. The mortality rate has been close to 70%, according to the World Health Organisation.
