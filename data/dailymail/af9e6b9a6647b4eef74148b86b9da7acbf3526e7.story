Giovanni Simeone, the 19-year-old son of Atletico Madrid boss Diego, scored a delightful goal for River Plate in their 3-1 victory over Libertad in the Copa Sudamericana on Thursday night.

The youngster came on as a sub with just under 20 minutes to go before putting the game against the Paraguayan side to bed with a delightful finish using the outside of his right boot.

And he clearly looked delighted in his celebrations, unsurprising considering it was his first goal for the club in 2014.

The match was a first-leg tie in the last-16 of the 2014 Copa Sudamericana. The second leg will take place at River Plate's home next Wednesday.

Giovanni was born in Spain while his father was playing for Atletico in the 1990s, but seems set on following his father into playing for Argentina after making his debut for their Under-20s side last month.

Diego made 106 appearances for the national side in a 14-year international career, playing at the 1994, 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as winning the Copa America in 1991 and 1993.

Last season, he led Atletico  to the La Liga title and the Champions League final, which they lost 4-1 to rivals Real Madrid after extra-time.
