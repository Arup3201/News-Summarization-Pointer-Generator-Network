The omens are good that 2012 will be an excellent year, a leading druid said today, after the sun shone on Stonehenge during a dawn ceremony to mark the winter solstice.

Organisers of next year's London Olympics could perhaps take heart from the positive pronouncement by Rollo Maughfling, the arch druid of the standing stones in Wiltshire, after this morning's ceremony.

He said that the sun rising over the horizon at the end of the ceremony, bathing more than 1,000 people who attended in pale light, meant good things for the next 12 months.

The mild temperatures and morning light at the pre-historic site were in marked contrast to last year's solstice, when the stones were surrounded by a thick blanket of snow and the mist obscured the actual sunrise.

Mr Maughfling said: 'Just as the ceremony came to an end the sun came over the horizon, it was excellent.

'It has been a very jolly occasion. It's a good omen for the year ahead.'

During the winter solstice, the sun is closer to the horizon than at any other time in the year, meaning shorter days and longer nights.

The day after the winter solstice marks the beginning of lengthening days, leading up to the summer solstice in June.

Although the solstice usually falls on December 21, fluctuations in the modern calendar -  which does not correspond exactly to the solar year of 365.2422 days - mean the pagan community were marking the first day of this winter today.

The odds of this Christmas being the warmest on record have been slashed by bookies.

Ladbrokes has also had to suspend all betting on snow markets as punters are set to scoop up to £20,000 following a series of shrewd bets during the earlier cold snap that there would be no snow in the UK on Christmas Day.

It's now just 2/1 (from 20/1) that we will have the warmest Christmas Day ever recorded in England, while north of the border the odds are 3/1 (from 20/1)

Warm-weather madness could also spread to the Royal Family as the the bookies offer 100/1 that any member is spotted in flip-flops during their stay at Sandringham.

It's 500/1 Christmas shoppers panic-buying suncream cause supermarkets to sell out and just even money that a national newspaper carries a picture (taken on Christmas Day) of a child eating an ice cream or building a sandcastle on a beach.

Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: 'This mild weather gamble has got us sweating just as much as the rising temperatures. Punters are now banking on the mercury continuing to rise for a bumper Christmas pay-day.'Latest bettingAny member of the Royal Family to be spotted wearing flip-flops at Sandringham over Christmas 100/1UK supermarkets to sell out of suncream on Christmas Eve 500/1A picture of a child eating an ice cream/building a sandcastle on a beach on Christmas Day to be printed in a national newspaper Evens

Perhaps a more accurate forecast came from the weather professionals, who said that those hoping for a white Christmas will have to put up with a wet and warm one instead.

Temperatures could reach as high as 14C (57F) on Christmas Day, not far short of Britain's December 25 record of 15.6C (60F), set in 1896 at Leith in Edinburgh.

But the mildness will be accompanied by rain that could be heavy in parts of western Scotland.

Following two snowy, very cold Decembers, the festive season started today with temperatures as high as 12C (54F).

The thermometer is set to reach similar heights tomorrow in England and Wales which will be cloudy with rain moving south, but it will be cooler and showery in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Rain will continue in northern parts of Britain on Christmas Eve, with generally fine weather in England and Wales.

The high of 14C on Christmas Day is 
likely to be reached in Scotland, but Scots and people in Northern 
Ireland will also have to contend with wet and windy conditions, with 
gusts of up to 60mph.

It will stay generally cloudy, with some drizzle, in England and Wales on December 25 with temperatures reaching 13C.

There
 will be similar temperatures on Boxing Day which will see Scotland and 
Northern Ireland having more rain, while in England and Wales it will be
 dry, but cloudy.

Rachel Vince, a forecaster for MeteoGroup UK, said: 'This
 is likely to be one of the warmer Christmases. It's certainly going to 
be very mild, although there's going to be quite a lot of rain in 
places.'
