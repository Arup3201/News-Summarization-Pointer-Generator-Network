Clear: Terry Robinson survived two inquiries 

Leicester City director of football Terry Robinson has survived inquiries by both his club and the FA over an alleged racist comment about a member of staff.

It is claimed Robinson, a former FA international committee member and Sheffield United chairman, described a Leicester employee as a ‘darkie’ while in a group conversation at the training ground.

There was enough concern around the club, including among some of the players when they found out about it, for the FA to be informed by a third party. 

The FA took the claim seriously enough to conduct a thorough inquiry. However, it was found there was no case to answer because none of those involved had made a complaint.

Leicester conducted their own probe following the FA’s verdict and came to the same conclusion. A club spokesman said: ‘This matter was looked into in the correct way and there is nothing further to say.’

Robinson declined to comment on Tuesday

David Gill’s decision not to stand for the British vice-presidency on FIFA’s executive committee gives the FA a golden opportunity to put forward a distinguished former player, rather than one of the suits on the FA Council.

And with all 54 UEFA countries voting on the home nations’ position for the first time — and Michel Platini keen to promote ex-players — a popular English footballer would be a strong favourite to beat the time-servers due to be put forward by Wales and Scotland.

Platini was responsible for the choice of former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who was the most wooden presenter at the Champions League draw. Ironically broadcast journalist Pedro Pinto, who had smoothly hosted the previous eight draws when at CNN, is now Platini’s media adviser.

MCC expect Sir Ian Botham, who is a much better speech maker than his Sky commentaries suggest, to be worth hearing when he delivers the 2014 Cowdrey Lecture at Lord’s on Wednesday. The talk is being relayed live for the first time on MCC’s YouTube platform.

One of the biggest mysteries of transfer deadline day was a certain Jonathan Hope acting as spokesman on the progress of Danny Welbeck’s move from Manchester United to Arsenal. 

It certainly surprised both clubs and the Welbeck family, who represent Danny, as none of them had heard of him. 

The unlicensed Hope, a self-styled football broker working as a consultant for Revolution Sports Management in Glasgow, says he has no involvement with Welbeck but had put his name forward to Spurs and Newcastle trying to engineer a deal.

Sky deadline disaster

Sky Sports News are having to rethink their transfer deadline-day strategy after Monday’s chaotic coverage.

This included numerous obscene comments from fans positioned behind Sky reporters around the clubs, sex toys being brandished on air at Aston Villa and Everton and a full-scale anti-Sky protest at Crystal Palace.

The fall-out saw SSN boss Andy Cairns having to account to regulators OFCOM, who received eight complaints about foul language. The clubs are also increasingly concerned by Sky’s over-the-top grandstanding on the day.

A Sky spokesman said: ‘We apologise to those whose enjoyment was spoiled by a small number of incidents and we’re looking into ways to avoid this happening again.’

David Haigh, the former Leeds United managing director imprisoned in Dubai without charge for nearly four months, has brought in handwriting experts to help show that the signature on documents which former Leeds owners GFH Capital allege involve fraudulent activity is not his.

Ticketmaster have paid what looks a high price for their computer problems before London 2012. German rivals Eventim have won the contract for Rio 2016 after three summer Olympics with Ticketmaster.
