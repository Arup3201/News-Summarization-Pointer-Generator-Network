Disturbing footage has emerged allegedly showing Syrian troops beating an anti-government rebel in the suburbs of the country's capital, Damascus.

The mobile video, which came to light yesterday, has not yet been verified.

It shows a man lying face down on a dusty floor, his hands behind his back as three others - two of them wearing fatigues -  stand on his neck and back, kicking him and hitting him with a small club.

The clip was uncovered by news agency AFP as a UN-brokered peace deal for Syria appeared to collapse.

President Bashar Assad's government made a new last minute demand that its opponents provide 'written guarantees' to lay down their weapons before regime forces withdraw from cities - a call swiftly rejected by the country's main rebel group.

It came amid claims that heavy fighting during the past week has led to 1,000 deaths.

The deal, brokered by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, was due to take effect on Tuesday, paving the way for negotiations to end the country's year-old crisis, which the UN estimates has killed 9,000 people.

Mr Annan said last week that the Syrian president had accepted the plan and its call for government forces to pull back from urban centres.

But yesterday Syria's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jihad Makdessi, placed a new condition - that the opposition agree in writing 'to halt violence with all its forms and their readiness to lay down weapons.'

The commander of the rebel Free 
Syrian Army, Riad al-Asaad, said his group was prepared to abide by the 
Annan agreement, but rejected the government's new unilateral demand.

The
Free Syrian Army does not recognise the regime 'and for that reason we 
will not give guarantees,' he said, adding the government should 
withdraw its forces to bases and remove checkpoints from streets.

Mr
Annan's deal calls for government forces to withdraw from population 
centres on Tuesday, to be followed by a full ceasefire by both sides by 
6am on Thursday.

Even before the setback, expectations were low that the Assad regime would honor the agreement.

Russia, an Assad ally that supports 
the cease-fire plan, may now be the only one able to salvage it. The 
rest of the international community, unwilling to contemplate military 
intervention, has little leverage over Syria.

However, in recent days, Syrian 
forces have stepped up shelling attacks on restive towns, and activists 
say scores of civilians have been killed daily - at least 100 on 
Saturday alone.

Mr Annan said in a statement that 'the present escalation of violence is unacceptable'.

He
also reminded the government 'of the need for full implementation of 
its commitments,' though it was unclear whether his statement was issued
before or after Damascus imposed new conditions for complying with the 
truce.

Activists said at least 21 people were killed in violence yesterday.

In addition to demanding written 
guarantees from the opposition, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdessi said Syria also wants assurances from Annan that Qatar, Turkey 
and Saudi Arabia - Assad's most active critics - halt 'financing and 
arming of terrorist groups.'

Qatar and Saudi Arabia are said to be
creating a multimillion pound fund to pay rebel fighters, while Turkey 
has floated the idea of creating buffer zones for refugees in Syrian 
territory, near the Turkish border.

Many had expected the Assad regime to
stall and create new obstacles to a truce because it has little to fear
from the international community, said Peter Harling, an analyst at the
International Crisis Group think tank.

'Nothing seems to have a price tag,' 
he said, noting that regime has been accused of shelling whole 
neighborhoods, exacting collective punishment and driving people out of 
their homes.

The regime might also be reluctant to move forward for fear of losing control.

While Annan's plan calls for eventual negotiations between the government and the opposition over Syria's political future, anti-regime activists say huge numbers of protesters would probably flood the streets and quickly topple Assad if he were forced to halt his yearlong crackdown.

Makdessi, the Syrian official, suggested that a truce without guarantees would give rebels the upper hand.

He said Syria will not allow a repeat of what happened during the Arab League's observer mission in Syria in January, when Assad pulled back his forces, only to see rebels flood the vacated areas.

The Syrian foreign minister is expected in Moscow on Monday, but it is not clear whether Russia will step in to try to salvage the Annan plan it had supported enthusiastically.

Activists said rebel fighters shot down a Syrian army helicopter with a heavy machine gun in northwestern Idlib province yesterday.

Some of the heaviest fighting of the day was in Homs, where government troops attacked several rebel-held neighborhoods, said Badrakhan, the local activist.

In the Khaldiyeh neighborhood, 40 bodies were piled in a room in a makeshift hospital because the constant shelling has prevented burials, he said, adding that activists are aiming fans at the corpses so they won't decompose quickly.

'We might have to bury them in public gardens,' he said.

Near the capital of Damascus, government troops raided the suburbs of Darya, Douma and Beit Jin.

The grass-roots Local Coordination Committees put the day's death toll on the opposition side at 45, including six children.

It said nine people were killed in Homs and 13 in Hama province, among them seven members of one family.

The Observatory reported at least 21 civilians killed in fighting and shelling by government forces, along with seven rebel fighters and 12 soldiers.
