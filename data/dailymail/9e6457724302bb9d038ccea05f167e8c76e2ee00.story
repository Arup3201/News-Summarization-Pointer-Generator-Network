Great Britain captain Leon Smith will be keeping his fingers crossed for a home tie when the draw is made for the 2015 Davis Cup World Group on Thursday.

Smith's first seven ties were all at home, with Britain winning six of them to climb from the depths of a Europe/Africa Zone Group II relegation play-off to the brink of the top tier.

The Scot's team then won away at Croatia to book their place back in the World Group.

Britain then stunned the USA in San Diego for their first victory at the elite level of the team competition since 1986 before losing narrowly to Italy in the quarter-finals.

All those three ties were on clay and, with it being Andy Murray's weakest surface, Smith knows an away tie would almost certainly mean another outing on the red stuff.

Britain are unseeded so will be paired with one of the eight seeds for the first round, which takes place from March 6-8.

They are only guaranteed to be away if they draw Novak Djokovic's Serbia, while a tie against Canada would require the drawing of lots.

But should Britain draw either of this year's finalists, France or Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Italy or USA, they would play at home.

The highest-profile home tie under Smith's leadership came in April 2013, when Britain recovered from 2-0 down to defeat Russia at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry.

With Murray likely to play and the potential of some of the world's top players coming to visit, a home tie would provide the opportunity to play at a large arena and with the choice of surface up to Smith and his team.

Dan Evans reached the 2013 US Open third round but his ranking has plummeted to 269

The main barrier to further British success in Davis Cup remains the lack of a world-class singles player to support Murray.

James Ward, whose win over Sam Querrey was the crucial result in the USA upset, has continued to make steady progress and is ranked at a career-high mark of 121.

But Dan Evans, another of Britain's recent Davis Cup heroes, has slumped to 269, and Ward is the only player other than Murray in the top 230.

Another option could be world No 144 Aljaz Bedene, who is in the process of applying for a British passport and could be eligible by March.

The Slovenian is particularly at home on clay and Smith was keeping a close eye on him at the US Open.
