Joe Biden's niece allegedly told police officers 'you don't know who I am' when she was arrested following a fight with her roommate which landed her in jail.

According to court documents, Caroline Biden, said: 'I shouldn't be handcuffed! You don't know who you're doing this to.'

The 26-year-old was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent.

On her way out: Caroline Biden's right eye had a visible bruise when she appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court on October 29 in response to charges filed against her during a September 17 altercation

Trying to hide: Biden, the Vice President's 26-year-old niece, used sunglasses to keep her bruise under wraps

She was spotted with a 
very visible black eye during her Tuesday court appearance though it is 
not clear if that stems from the September 17 altercation that landed 
her in police custody.

Biden is charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and harassing a former roommate.

Friends of the young woman revealed after that she had begun to 'unravel' as a result of the pressure of being related to the Vice President.  

Little is known about the specific fight that lead to police being called to her Tribeca apartment- including the identity of her roommate- but now the newly-released police report details how she did not leave the scene quietly.

Avoiding a spectacle: Caroline Biden was wrapped in a bedsheet when she was transported from the Tribeca police precinct to the awaiting ambulance on Tuesday morning

The New York Post reports that she tried to hit one of the responding officers who showed up at her apartment during the fight. 

The paper cites court documents that describe how she also tried to sneak out of the station house once officers put her inside a holding cell.

'I am informed that Officer Martin had to outstretch both of his arms horizontally so the defendant could not get around him and that the defendant stated in substance, "Don’t touch me," and attempted to push away from Officer Martin,' an officer wrote in the criminal complaint.

'I am informed by Officer Martin that he was able to gain control of the defendant by holding her arm and that when he was walking her back to the holding cell, the defendant grabbed a door frame, and held onto cells, in an effort to prevent Officer Martin from bringing her back to the holding cell, an official function.'

Questions remain: Police officials confirmed to MailOnline that she was transported to Beth Israel hospital but they did not have any information about what caused her to seek medical treatment following her fight with a roommate

Her Tuesday court appearance was a pre-trial hearing and the next date in the case is when her lawyers have to report back on December 17, but she is not required for that appearance.

This is not Miss Biden's first run-in with the law, as she was briefly detained by Amtrak police over a disputed train fare in 2009.

At the time she claimed she was treated unfairly because of her family's connection to the Vice President, and said she had intended to pay for her ticket on the train, a friend said.

The most recent altercation took place at her luxury apartment. Her father James, who is the brother of the vice President, paid the deposit for the apartment she was renting from NYU student Anne Marie Yacopetti.

Miss Yacopetti's mother claimed the gallery worker would pay the rent she owed, 'when she feels like it' and added: 'If you’re an elitist Biden, I guess you think you’re owed the world.'

Pressure: A former friend previously said that Caroline was 'unraveling' because of the expectations put upon her and her family due to her uncle's role as Vice President

Shortly after the arrest last month, one of her former friends weighed in on the situation.

'The pressure of being Joe Biden’s niece made her totally unravel. it’s a desire for attention, a cry for help,' socialite Paul Johnson Calderon told The Post.

He described the Georgetown University graduate as a 'hot mess' and likened her to actress Amanda Bynes.

'She’s surrounded by a lot of people who use her because of who she is. Guys would want to date her because of who her ­uncle is,' Mr Calderon told the Post from a sober-living facility.

He added that he ended their friendship because he is dealing with an alcohol addiction.

Miss Biden, who works at Higher Pictures gallery in New York, also went to rehab for alcohol and Adderall addiction while at university, another friend claimed.
