With Arsenal's passage to the knockout phase of the Champions League already assured, Arsene Wenger has named six rising stars from the club's academy in his squad for Tuesday night's match with Galatasaray in Istanbul.

Ahead of the match, we run the rule over the half-dozen hoping to make an impression out in Turkey.

Chuba Akpom (19, striker, English)

Akpom is probably the best known of the six, with Wenger commenting in Monday's press conference that the striker is 'close to the first team.'

The 19-year-old, who comes from Newham, has already had plenty of exposure to the first-team picture, making his Premier League debut from the bench in a 3-1 win at Sunderland back in September 2013.

He also played in the Gunners' League Cup win over West Bromwich last season and was named on the bench for further Premier League games at home to Liverpool and West Ham, as well as the Wembley FA Cup semi-final with Wigan.

He spent time on loan at Brentford and Coventry City to gain experience last season and has been in fine form for Arsenal's Under 21s this campaign, scoring nine times.

Akpom has represented England at every level from Under 16 to Under 20 and has been a reliable goalscorer at each age group.

Gedion Zelalem (17, midfielder, German)

Berlin-born teenager Zelalem was signed by Arsenal in the summer of 2013 after impressing scout Daniel Karbassiyoon while playing for American side Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match.

He almost immediately progressed from the Under 16s to the Under 21s and in July 2013 accompanied the first-team squad on their Asian tour.

Though his selection came as a surprise to many, Zelalem seized his chance and his style even drew favourable comparisons in some quarters to Cesc Fabregas.

He was expected to make his Premier League debut in the early portion of the 2013-14 campaign but injury held up his progress.

In the end, he made his competitive debut in an FA Cup tie with Coventry City on January 24, replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with 19 minutes to play.

Though no additional first-team appearances were forthcoming, Zelalem is a regular in the Under 21 team and also the Under 19 side that plays in the UEFA Youth League.

Zelalem has so far represented the country of his birth, Germany, to Under 17 standard.

Ainsley Maitland-Niles (17, winger, English)

Rapid winger Maitland-Niles was named on the bench for Arsenal's defeat at Stoke at the weekend and is now set for his first European trip with the senior team.

The youngster started last season with the Under 18s but it quickly became apparent that he was more than competent at a higher standard with his pace and crossing ability.

He made 14 appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and was pretty much an ever-present in Arsenal's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League.

Maitland-Niles was also influential in Arsenal's run to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup, where they were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea.

He has cemented his place in the Under 21 side this season, swapping between right wing and central midfield positions, and has also represented England at Under 18 level for the first time.

Stefan O'Connor (17, defender, English)

Commanding centre-half O'Connor has established himself in Arsenal's Under 21 side despite only being 17 years of age.

He has always been ahead of the curve in that regard but has really pushed on in the last 18 months, establishing himself as a regular in the Under 21 team and the UEFA Youth League side.

O'Connor scored his first goal at Under 21 level in a 4-3 win over Manchester City back in April. 

He has also been capped for England at Under 17 standard, playing in two matches against Belgium at St George's Park back in January.

Alex Iwobi (18, winger, born in Nigeria and plays for England)

Born in Lagos, Iwobi is the nephew of national hero Jay-Jay Okocha and has been with Arsenal since the age of eight.

The 18-year-old is equally adept playing on the left flank or in central midfield in support of the striker.

His only involvement with the first team to date came when he was included in the squad for last season's Capital One Cup tie at West Brom, though he didn't make it off the bench.

Last season saw Iwobi make regular appearances for the Under 21s and he also featured in the UEFA Youth League and FA Youth Cup, where he scored goals against Torquay United and Charlton Athletic.

Having signed his first professional contract at the club, Iwobi is expected to kick on and reach greater heights.

He has played for England up to Under 18 standard.

Glen Kamara (19, defensive midfield, Finnish)

Kamara combines style and substance in the defensive midfield position and this will be his first taste of first-team involvement.

Born in Tampere, Finland, Kamara joined Arsenal from Southend United in 2012, quickly establishing himself as a regular in all the youth competitions.

This includes the Under 21 Premier League, where he made 12 appearances last season, and the UEFA Youth League, where he played in every game except the quarter-final with Barcelona.

A Finland Under 21 international, Kamara has cemented his place in Steve Gatting's Under 21 team this year.
