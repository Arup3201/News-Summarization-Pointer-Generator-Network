2-year-old Austin Hawkins learned a valuable lesson the hard way. When your dad is in the NFL, he better be your favorite player. 

That's the takeaway from an Instagram video posted by Cleveland Brown's wide receiver Andrew Hawkins in which he asked his son who his favorite player was. 

Austin replied with A.J. Green and Mohamed Sanu, two of Hawkins' former teammates on the Cincinnati Bengals.   

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Andrew Hawkins posted a joking Instagram video of him kicking his son Austin, 2, out of the house for saying Bengals players A.J. Green and Mohamed Sanu were his favorite players

Maybe one of Austin's favorite players can take him in

A moment later the boy is left out in the cold with just a suitcase of supplies and his orange coat to sustain him.

'Good luck,' Hawkins says, and sighs as he shuts the door on his boy.
