Military top brass yesterday backed calls to keep the Tower of London’s poppies beyond Armistice Day.

Former senior Army figures and a decorated war hero added their support to a Daily Mail campaign to extend the poignant tribute to Britain’s First World War dead.

Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former Chief of the Defence staff, said he would welcome a decision to keep the poppies until the end of the year, in line with commemorative events.

Military top brass have backed calls to keep the Tower of London’s poppies beyond Armistice Day

An online petition calling for the display to be kept at the Tower for a year has already attracted more than 23,000 signatures

He told the Mail: ‘It has been a wonderful focal point for remembering the fallen, I’m all in favour of it. If it … did stay until the end of 2014, that would be marvellous.’

Lord Bramall’s views were echoed by Major General Patrick Cordingley, the commander of the Desert Rats in the 1991 Gulf War.

He said: ‘They should be there for as long as possible because it is a magnificent site and remembers the sacrifice of the 888,246 who died fighting for the country.’

Adding his weight to the calls, Major Charles Heyman, a senior defence analyst and editor of Armed Forces of the UK, said: ‘Anybody who has had chance to see the poppies has been struck by them. I would like to see them there for a longer time.’

Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, who was awarded the George Cross for throwing himself on a Taliban hand grenade in Afghanistan to save his comrades, said: ‘The poppies have been a huge success, attracted millions of visitors and raised millions of pounds.

'I understand people wishing to keep the poppies for longer… I would have to agree.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson said he was keen to explore whether the display could stay in place for longer

More than four million people have already viewed the sea of 888,246 red ceramic flowers which fill the moat

An online petition calling for the display to be kept at the Tower for a year has already attracted more than 23,000 signatures.

On Thursday all four main political parties threw their weight behind calls to keep the poppies for at least another week.

But last night Tower officials remained adamant that the lengthy job of taking away all the flowers would begin on Wednesday – the day after Armistice Day. 

They did however announce that the poppies will be floodlit for an extra two and a half hours each day to allow more to view the installation. They will be illuminated from 4.30am until dawn and then from dusk to midnight.

Today David Cameron will announce that part of the display is to go on a four-year tour of the country before going on permanent display at the Imperial War Museum.

And the Weeping Willow and Wave elements of the installation will remain in place until the end of November.

The Prime Minister said: ‘The poppy display at the Tower of London has in a very short space of time become a much loved and respected monument.

‘We want to ensure that as many people as possible have the opportunity to witness it, and the government is providing money and working with charities to do so.

‘By displaying parts of the installation around the country and then permanently in the Imperial War Museum, we have ensured that this poignant memorial will be saved for the nation.’

Supported by donations from two charities, the Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation, together with government funding, two major parts of the installation, the Weeping Window and The Wave, will go on a journey to sites around the UK until 2018.

The Government has agreed to provide £500,000 to cover the cost of storing, transporting and installing the poppy sculptures in towns and cities across the UK. The funding will come from fines on banks who manipulated the Libor interest rates.

More than four million people have already viewed the sea of red ceramic flowers. 

Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which operates the landmark, says 11,000 volunteers will take about two weeks to remove the flowers and post them to their new owners.

All 888,246 poppies – one for each British and colonial death during the war – have been sold at £25 each, with part of the estimated £15million proceeds shared between six service charities.

A spokesman said: ‘The transience of the installation is key to the artistic concept, with the dispersal of the poppies into hundreds of thousands of homes marking the final phase of this evolving installation.’
