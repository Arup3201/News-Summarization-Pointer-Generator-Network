'Unwelcome advances': MP Mike Hancock faces serious allegations about the his conduct

The woman at the centre of the  latest Lib Dem sex scandal has told how she contemplated suicide over the ‘disgusting’ way she has been treated by the party.

And the vulnerable mother of one condemned its leader Nick Clegg, saying he had shown disregard for her welfare after  she accused Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock of sexually harassing her.

The 39-year-old from Portsmouth told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s dreadful how I’ve been treated. The Lib Dems have tried to sweep my complaints under the carpet.

‘This should have been dealt with ages ago, in 2010 when I first came forward, rather than now.

‘The whole of their party should all be held to account and they should hang their heads in shame. Nick Clegg said he would clean up his party but he has done nothing.’

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, complained about Mr Hancock’s alleged harassment to senior Lib Dem officials almost three years ago at the party’s Westminster headquarters.

In a letter to Mr Clegg, she said the MP had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances, forcibly kissed her and twice ran his fingers through her hair. She was subjected to two gruelling interviews by senior Lib Dem officials, who tested her claims.

But it is only now that Mr Hancock, 67, has finally been suspended by the party.

Yesterday, the alleged victim, who has a 16-year-old son, told how the distress caused by the long-running saga had affected her fragile mental health – and even made her consider suicide.

‘I’ve thought to myself maybe I should take my own life, but I have a son to think of.’

She added that she has to live with the memories of what is alleged to have happened with Mr Hancock ‘every day’ and has suffered from depression ever since.

‘I feel I have been let down by all authorities,’ she said. ‘You know, the police, Liberal Democrat party, Nick Clegg, you know, everybody that’s been involved.

‘I have been hugely let down. My voice has never been heard.’  

'You are special and sexy':  Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock allegedly sent a string of lewd texts containing filthy comments to woman, who had mental health problems and had previously been sexually abused

She first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours. A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged unwanted sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer.

The woman added that unlike the Lib Dem members who complained about Lord Rennard,  she never had her allegations taken seriously.

She said: ‘I feel over the Rennard stuff because they are in a high position, the women  – they have actually been heard. But whereas if it’s an individual like me, they don’t really get listened to.’ The victim, who suffers from a long-term mental illness, said the affair had exacerbated her condition, adding: ‘I see someone because of my mental health but this whole situation has made it worse.

‘It has made me angry, upset and depressed. I’m very emotional. At times it has made me suicidal. I’ve had to take more medication because of it.’

She added: ‘Nick Clegg said people with mental health problems should get extra help.

‘Well he needs to practice what he preaches.’

The report into Mr Hancock’s conduct, by Nigel Pascoe QC, was delivered to the party in August.

The MP had voluntarily resigned the Liberal Democrat whip  in June after the woman threatened to sue. Mr Hancock did not give evidence to Mr Pascoe.

But it was never published and on Tuesday the Lib Dem-controlled council in Portsmouth – where Mr Hancock is also a local councillor – voted to keep it under wraps. It emerged only when political blogger Guido Fawkes published it on Wednesday.

Mr Pascoe’s report found that the vulnerable constituent – who had been sexually abused as a child – had been bombarded by lewd text messages from Mr Hancock for months.

The alleged victim, who gave evidence under oath, said in the report: ‘He forcibly kissed me.

‘He grabbed my arms and he stuck his tongue down my throat and I was pushing him away and I shouted up to my son and he put his hand over my mouth and was restraining me really hard and I had red marks on my arms.’

On another occasion, she reported: ‘He came round and said he was feeling horny.

‘I said “go home to your wife” and “what kind of woman do you think I am?”

‘I was sat away from him and he started rubbing himself.’

She said he undid his belt and flies and exposed himself. ‘I said “put it away, I think you are disgusting and you need some  help, you have a sexual problem”, she added. The alleged victim, referred to in the report as AH, told the QC: ‘That was the worst time, this really affected me.’

In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock. I am of the clear view that her account is credible  and merits both compassion  and respect.

‘I found AH to be a straightforward and vulnerable person, angry and hurt by what she said had happened to her.’  

Mr Hancock denies the allegations.

October 2009 - The woman, known as AH,  meets Mike Hancock for the first time at his surgery to ask for help over dispute with  neighbours.

February 2010 - Mr Hancock first visits  AH’s house.

March 2010
 - The MP takes the woman and her son on a visit to Parliament. He gives
 her  a teddy bear as a present and starts sending her text messages.

June 2010 - AH has a hysterectomy.

July 2010 - She makes first complaint about his behaviour to her family support worker. This is passed to the police.

September 2010 - AH asks police to open inquiries into Mr Hancock.

December 2010 - AH is told that police will not take action.

March 2011 - She writes to Lib Dem HQ for the first time about the allegations. No action is taken.

2012 – Lib Dems decide not to take the case further.

February 2013 - Nick Clegg’s office receives a letter from AH’s solicitor detailing the case. He accepts he received this.

June 2013 - Mr Hancock resigns the Lib Dem whip after AH launches a civil case.
