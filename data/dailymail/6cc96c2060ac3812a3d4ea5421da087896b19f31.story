Sting and Sir Richard Branson have been accused of using Uruguay as a 'laboratory' for the drug reform after backing a campaign to legalise cannabis in the country.

Uruguay is set to become the first nation in the world to allow anyone to grow, sell and consume cannabis freely.

The legal changes were brought about after a high-profile lobbying and TV campaign by pressure group the Drug Policy Alliance, on which both Sting and Sir Richard Branson are honorary international board members.

But the involvement of this influential American drug law reform organisation has been branded as 'meddling' and prompted a fierce backlash from critics of the legal changes.

Gerardo Amarilla, of the opposition National Party, launched a blistering attack on the two celebrities, accusing them of risking the health of a generation with their 'meddling' and turning the country into a 'laboratory' for reform.

He said: 'They shouldn't be meddling in Uruguay.

'They should be lobbying in their own country because they're not going to suffer the consequences here, the security and health problems.

'They're out of context here. This is a test that could go wrong and harm a generation.'

Speaking shortly after legislation was passed though congress, last week, Mr Amarilla, said the Uruaguan government was ‘playing with 
fire’ given the health risks he said were linked to marijuana use and 
the majority of Uruguayans are said to be against the decriminalisation 
move'

He said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana, which he 
called a 'gateway drug' for other chemical addictions that foster 
violent crimes. 

'Ninety-eight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana,'

Responding to the controversy, Sir 
Richard Branson said: 'While I am a member of the Drug Policy Alliance 
International Honorary Board (In Formation), I am an active member of 
the Global Commission on Drug Policy.

'For the past few years we have 
examined the war on drugs using a science-based approach.

'We feel 
strongly that it has failed and that there needs to be a different 
approach.

'We believe drugs should be treated as
a health problem not a criminal problem.

'This is a global problem, not a
national issue, and everyone who can should speak out to help change 
the failed war on drugs.'

Under a new bill passed by Uruguayan lawmakers, only the government would be allowed to sell the drug.

The controversial measure has the backing of President Jose Mujica, who says it will remove the profits from drug peddlers and divert users from harder drugs.

Uruguay’s House of Representatives passed the bill by 50 to 46 votes following a fierce debate earlier this month and it is expected to get an easier passage through the Senate to become law in the next few weeks.

Buyers would have to be over 18 and would be able to grow six plants at home or buy up to 40g (1.4 oz)a month in specially licenced government pharmacies.

The authorities would take control of every aspect of the marijuana business, from harvesting the plant right through to distribution and sale.

Ganja-rous game: Marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the Americas in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America

And in an effort to prevent foreign tourists from flocking to Uruguay to smoke marijuana, the legislation would restrict legal purchases to Uruguayans.

The vote also came days after Pope Francis criticised drug legalisation plans during a visit to neighbouring Brazil.

He said it was ‘necessary to tackle the problems which are at the root of drug abuse, promoting more justice, educating the youth with the values that live in society, standing by those who face hardship and giving them hope for the future.’

Sting was unavailable for comment.
