A 16-year-old Minnesota girl has died after a sledding accident as she visited friends on New Year's Eve.  

Katelyn Hank, who was captain of her school tennis team, died from her injuries on Tuesday night.

Her loss has devastated the community of Le Sueur, where she lived, and the school district has arranged for grief counselors to be on hand for friends of the popular student.

'All I can say is that this is devastating. Katelyn was a very kind and caring person,' the teenager's tennis coach, Linda Seaver, told Le Sueur News Herald.

Katelyn had an active part in the school community, and enjoyed singing and taking part in theater productions.

Details of the accident were not available but the 16-year-old was said to have enjoyed being outdoors and spending time with her friends.

'She was just a really good kid,' Superintendent Rich Hanson said.

Results of the first study into sledding accidents showed they were to blame for at least 20,820 injuries in the U.S. each year, NBC News reported.

Friends of Katelyn took to social media to pay tribute to the teenager, who was remembered as always having a smile on her face.

Her sister Kelsey posted on Facebook that she was heartbroken, and talked of how the pair had just got pedicures the last time they saw each other.

Students at the school where Katelyn was a junior will have access to grief counselors when they return to class on Monday.

The school released a statement saying: 'We at Le Sueur-Henderson Public Schools are very saddened about the recent passing of our student, Katelyn Hank.'
