A New Jersey man had his left leg amputated after a drunk driver struck him and dragged him over a mile with his body protruding through the windshield, officials said.

Kenneth C Moeller, 61, of Lanoka Harbor was on life support at Jersey Shore University Medical Center after the operation, following a grisly car crash in Ocean Township on Monday evening.

NJ.com reports that Marcos Ortega, 33, was allegedly under the influence as he traveled north on Route 9 in a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

Accused: Marcos Ortega, 33, was arrested after allegedly striking Kenneth C Moeller, 61, in a drunk driving accident and refusing to stop as Moeller lay on the hood of his car

He veered onto the shoulder of the highway, where he struck Moeller as he was walking, according to investigators.

The crash resulted in Moeller becoming stuck in the windshield of Ortega's car, which the driver continued to operate for a mile and a half.

It was only when Ocean Township Patrolman Kyle Flatt arrived, in response to a report of a car driving erratically, that Ortega stopped the car, authorities said.

The Waretown Volunteer Fire Department and First-Aid were called and assisted police personnel with extricating Moeller.

The victim was flown to the hospital with serious injuries. He was listed as being in critical condition before his surgery.

Critical: The Ocean County Prosecutor's office said that Moeller required an amputation of his left leg after being taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in critical condition

The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said police conducted sobriety tests on Ortega, and found the driver was under the influence. 

Ortega was charged with leaving the scene of a motor vehicle crash and causing serious bodily injury to another while driving under the influence, with bail set at $150,000.
