Leon Osman is eager to see new
faces alongside him in the Everton side for his forthcoming testimonial.

Everton entertain Porto at
Goodison on Sunday, August 3 in the side’s only pre-season fixture on home
soil.

The fixture is Osman’s testimonial
game, after playing more than 10 years of first team football for the Blues.

And the experienced England
international midfielder would relish the chance to share the contest with a
number of new faces in the Everton ranks.

Muhamed Besic is on the verge of
becoming Roberto Martinez’s second summer signing following a permanent deal
for Gareth Barry.

And the Blues chief has admitted
he is optimistic of further new arrivals checking in at Goodison in the coming
days.

Osman said: 'We try not to be
distracted by speculation. But sometimes you can’t help but hear the rumours
about who the manager wants to bring in to the club.

'Besic should be completed in the
next few days and we’re aware of the rumours about a couple more coming in. It would
be good if any new arrivals could play in my testimonial.'

One name in particular has caught
Osman’s eye. Romelu Lukaku enjoyed a successful campaign with the Blues during
a season-long loan from Chelsea, netting 16 goals in the royal blue jersey.

He has been heavily linked with a
permanent switch back to Goodison this summer and Osman would love to see him
back on Merseyside.

He added: 'It would be good to
have Romelu back. We know the quality he's got. There might be a bit more to do
to get him back here but it would be great if he could come back in time to
play in the game.'
