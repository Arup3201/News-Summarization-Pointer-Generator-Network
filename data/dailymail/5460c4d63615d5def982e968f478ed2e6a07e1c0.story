One-year-old Neapolitan mastiff Flo had so much excess skin on her forehead she struggled to see and developed an infection in her eyes.

The stray pooch's wrinkled look resulted in her developing cherry eye disease, an infection that she was genetically predisposed to.

Animal rescuers found the pooch on the streets after she was abandoned by her owners - who they believe could not afford to treat her.

Before: One-year-old mastiff Flo suffered from cherry eye disease as her droopy skin caused her to get infection in her eye

After: Flo's sight was saved by a £1,000 facelift, seen here recovering from surgery

But Flo's eyesight has now been saved thanks a £1,000 facelift which involved lifting the skin around hers eyes to clear the infection.

Flo, who is being cared for by Happy Endings Rescue in Faversham, Kent, is now looking for a new home.

The charity are willing to let her go for free even though the prized pet would have cost £1,000 to buy as a pup.

Breeding: Cherry eye is a genetic condition which is hard to prevent, which could be why Flo's breeders do not want her back

The popularity of pet plastic surgery is on the rise in the UK.

UK insurance company Petplan produced numbers based on claims made by British pet owners in 2010.

Not only was there a jump in nose jobs by 25 per cent over three years, but more than £1million was also invested in eyelifts, says PetPlan.

On top of that, figures show that in 2010 Briton's spent £1.6million on pet plastic surgery.

Procedures range from artificial nails to nose jobs to testicular implants on neutered animals.

Happy Endings founder Chris Johns said: 'Flo was a stray. She was in a really bad way.

'I think her owner could not afford her treatment. She was microchipped to her breeder. But the breeder does not want her back.

'I don't know why people breed dogs like this if they do not want to care for them. She is feeling much better now she can see.

'The vet cut in to her brow and pulled her eye lids up. If that doesn't work then she will have to go back for a full face lift.

Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane, also called the third eyelid, present in the eyes of dogs and cats but it is most often seen in young dogs of various breeds under the age of two.

It is considered a genetic problem and little is known about how to prevent it. This means that dogs with the condition should not be used for breeding.

Mr Johns added: 'She is being cared for in a foster home, but will need a permanent home once she is better.

'We currently face vet bills in the region of £12,000 for all our animals. We are trying to raise the money needed to bring these bills down.'
