Alastair Cook sat at a gloomy Lord’s yesterday and insisted that the dark clouds which have hovered over England since they sacked Kevin Pietersen have finally cleared.

The publication of Pietersen’s book is seen by Cook as the last chapter in a miserable story which has dogged England ever since they were thrashed by Australia and he will travel to Sri Lanka tomorrow insisting the slate is now clean.

‘We’ve had a couple of weeks together and we haven’t felt the need to talk about it at all,’ insisted the England captain of KP’s book.

Cook says England will focus on Sri Lanka and can move on from the Pietersen saga

‘All the fall-out has happened now. I felt in the summer we were moving on as a team but we had this publication date hanging over us and everyone was talking about what was going to be said. Now it’s all in the open from his side, no more can come out, and we can build and look forward as a side.’

Cook knows that the best way for England to move on would be to end a run of five one-day series defeats in six when they play Sri Lanka seven times in the build-up to the World Cup.

The England captain confounded the doubters in Test cricket this summer and has to do it again now in the face of questions over his position as one-day leader from former team-mate Graeme Swann and he was keen to hit back on Friday.

‘Well, didn’t Michael Vaughan want me out as Test captain as well?’ said Cook. ‘He actually had to admit he was wrong. It would be great if people had to change their tune over the one-day game in five months time.

‘I’m convinced I can do the job. The only time England have been No 1 in one-day was when I was captain.’

That was two years ago when England looked like World Cup contenders, as they did in reaching the Champions Trophy final, but their one-day form has deteriorated since.

‘I think the priorities changed,’ said Cook, who admitted he has no idea what his best World Cup side is. ‘We had back-to-back Ashes series so a lot of the guys were rested from one-day cricket. But there are no excuses now. We have time to focus on the one-day game and there are guys who are desperate to get into the World Cup squad.’

Meanwhile, Cook’s former opening partner Nick Compton has left Somerset by mutual agreement to ‘relocate to south west London’. 

Australia recovered from Michael Clarke’s early injury to beat South Africa by 32 runs in the first one-day international in Perth.
