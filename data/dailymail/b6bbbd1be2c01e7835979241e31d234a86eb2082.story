Home security footage has revealed two dogs sitting back on the sofa and watching as their owners' North Carolina home is ransacked by thieves.

The video, which was shared by the Durham County Sheriff's Office, shows two men entering through a door as the two dogs - which appear to be a pit bull and a white Maltese - go to meet them.

But one of the robbers brandishes a large metal shovel and pushes the confused animals back.

In just 23 seconds, the two men enter the home, grab a massive flat-screen television and leave - all while the animals sit on the sofa and watch.

Shock: The two dogs sit back in bewilderment and watch as the men ransack the home

The video doesn't have sound but it appears that the animals give a wary bark or two.

As the men walk away, the door is left open but luckily the timid animals remain inside the home.

Authorities said that the men made off with the television and other valuables during the break-in at 10.50am on June 16. No arrests have been made in the incident.

The Durham County Sheriff's Office has released the video on YouTube in the hope that someone might see it and recognize the robbers.
