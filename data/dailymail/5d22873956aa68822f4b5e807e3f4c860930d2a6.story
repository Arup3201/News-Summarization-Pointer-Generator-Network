These are the eerie images of Second World War bunkers that still crouch on the landscape as echoes of the biggest conflict in history.

The menacing bunkers stand as firmly as they did on D Day, 70 years ago - and these stunning pictures show the enormity of German defences.

Photographer Jonathan Andrew scoured the wartime territory of The Netherlands, France, and Belgium.

Mr Andrew has captured the stern beauty of structures once meant to withstand the full fury of war.

The 42-year-old, who is originally from Stockport, Cheshire, started his bunker odyssey in 2009 and has now visited them all over Europe.

Mr Andrew, who has now lived in Amsterdam, Holland, for the past 21 years, said: 'I originally found the geometry and shape of the structures fascinating and the fact that they were just left standing alone in a farmer's field or on a beach.

'It was as 
if they were still on guard but nobody had told them the war is over. 
Once I started photographing them it was impossible not to be moved by 
what the buildings symbolised and what they have witnessed.'

Mr
 Andrew said his photos were not taken to make an anti-war statement but
 to offer an insight into a fascinating chapter in history.

He
 said: 'As a photographer you try and point things out to people which 
you find beautiful or fascinating and ask them to take a longer, closer 
look.

'I'm
 not trying to make an anti-war statement but just bring them to peoples
 attention, show people these amazing buildings, steeped in such 
incredible history are still scattered throughout Europe's fields and 
dunes.

'I work on the bunker photographs only in the winter, it's taken about three winters to photograph the collection so far.

'It's a personal project, so I have to find time between my regular paid assignments.

'It's
 surprising to see some bunkers being used by farmers for other 
purposes, such as storing animal feed, farm equipment etc. I'm also 
amazed at the shear number of them still around, some in very good 
condition.'
