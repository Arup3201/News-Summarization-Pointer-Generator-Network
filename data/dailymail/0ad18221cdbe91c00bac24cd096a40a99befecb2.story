There was shock when Gone Girl – a film that made over $300m worldwide – was snubbed at the Oscars this week.

Rosamund Pike, the film’s star, was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Amy Dunne, who is beautiful, intelligent and seemingly innocent; until we learn she is actually a ruthless psychopath taking revenge for her husband’s infidelity by framing her own murder.

In the famous shower scene at the end of the film, jaws dropped as Rosamund slipped off her dress and revealed an envious body with incredible muscle definition.

In fact, Rosamund had to undergo four cycles of weight gain and loss to suit the sequence of filming.

Now, her personal trainer, professional fighter Holly Lawson, explains to how Rosamund achieved such a toned physique...

Just a few weeks after giving birth, Rosamund Pike shows off an absolutely enviable waist line in a corseted, strapless, slitted Givenchy gown.  Obviously made just for her, this dress shows off her incredible almost unearthly figure!

We are absolutely entranced by the lacework but the most obvious eye catching attribute of this dress is the color.  Red as roses or rubies, this will certainly make one a head turner if worn.

Being a lady in red is no easy feat so we suggest styling this dress exactly the way Rosamund did: with a simple ballerina's bun and  bare collarbones.

Since we're not best friends with Riccardo Tisci, head designer of Givenchy, we don't think we'll be getting a custom made Givenchy gown soon.  But we found some very suitable substitutes that give us all that wow factor.

Different weights for different scenes

When Amy Dunne runs off in Gone Girl, she packs on a few pounds as part of her disguise, only to return with a killer bob haircut and an even more killer body.

The film, which was shot out of sequence, required Rosamund to put on almost a stone and a half (9kg) and shed it over and over again so her body was in synch with her character’s, Healthista reports.

It’s an understatement to say that her trainer, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter Holly Lawson knows a thing or two about training for muscle gain and weight loss, since fighters constantly have to gain or lose weight rapidly to stay in a particular weight class.

Rosamund was forced to gain 20 lbs (9kg) in two and a half weeks during Gone Girl, and then lose 15 lbs (6.8kg) in ten days. She put on the weight through lifting heavy weights and then eating carbs to gain fat

In order to lose more than a stone for the final scenes of Gone Girl, Rosamund ate only protein, fat and vegetables, as well as carrying out twice daily plyometrics - resistance moves using body weight

Alkaline water is water with a pH balance of 7 or more - close to the body's natural 7.3-7.4 - and it’s believed to help reduce inflammation

You can buy alkaline drops that make the water more alkaline or add alkalising substances to it such as lemon or baking soda. 

The natural pH of water depends on where you’re getting it and it tends to range from 6-8.5 pH.  

Because alkaline water has a higher pH level than plain tap water, proponents say that it can neutralise acid in the bloodstream.

This apparently boosts metabolism and helps the body absorb nutrients more effectively, it is claimed.

Some even say that alkaline water can help prevent disease and slow the aging process. 

However, researchers have not verified these claims, say doctors at the Mayo Clinic. 

Some studies suggests that alkaline water may help slow bone loss, but further investigation is needed to determine if this influences overall bone mineral density and if the benefit is maintained over the long term. 

This made Lawson the perfect person to train Rosamund and keep her at the appropriate weight for filming.

‘What I did was employ a lot of the stuff I learned from fighting into the training with Rosamund,’ Ms Lawson told Healthista journalist Nicola Dall'Asen.

‘I know how far you can push the body and I knew how to bulk her up with water weight and later strip it out.’

Ms Lawson took Rosamund through four separate training cycles, to gain weight twice and to lose weight twice.

The two different goals made for two very different diet and exercise regimes.

When Ms Lawson was hired she had a mere two and a half weeks to help Rosamund gain 20lbs (9kg), but made sure that there a solid muscle foundation underneath the weight gain.

‘I put a lot of lean muscle on her, then some fat on top so when she leaned out she looked really good,’ Ms Lawson said.

Building muscle

She put on 8lbs (3.6kg) of lean muscle, to be exact.

To get there as fast as possible, Ms Lawson had Pike lifting the heaviest weights possible.

The workout was a basic weight lifting regime: squats, deadlifts, lunges, curls and other simple moves — but Rosamund was maxing out (that’s lifting as much as is physically possible for you) in eight repetitions.

That built a base of muscle that later became the reason for Pike’s incredible definition in the film’s ending scenes.

Gaining weight for Amy’s chubby scenes

Ms Lawson’s diet for Rosamund’s weight gain cycle included as much ‘good fat’ and protein as she wanted — foods like avocados, almond butter and salmon, and very few carbs.

Ms Lawson says these fats are necessary for muscle gain and tone because they ‘feed’ your muscles the proper nutrients to grow.

Then, a few days before the filming day, Rosamund was allowed to go crazy with carbs and dense foods to put a layer of fat on top of all the hard work she had just done.

So the next time you’re watching the movie and Amy’s looking a little chubbier than before, remember there’s a six pack under there somewhere.

Slimming back down for that shower scene

Then, before the famous shower scene she had ten days to lose 15 pounds (6.8 kg)

Both the diet and the workout changed completely - with carbs completely banned.

‘That’s when she was really eating like a fighter,’ Ms Lawson said.

She compares the diet for the weight loss cycle to the Paleo diet: Rosamund ate three meals a day involving a ton of leafy greens and drank alkaline water like it was nobody’s business.

The workout consisted of plyometrics (resistance moves involving jumping using your own body weight) and high intensity cardio (and a whole lot of running).

Every day’s plyometrics day was different — some days were just upper body, some just lower body, and some days were full-body workouts.

These workouts involved heart-pumping and toning moves like burpees, mountain climbers, and planks, planks, planks.

‘We’d do five million variations of plank all day every day. We’d do groupings of exercises and the last rotation was always a plank,’ she said.

In the week leading up to the shower scene, Ms Lawson was training with Rosamund twice a day.

The diet and workout regimes sound brutal to say the least.

It’s a real testament to how a great attitude can lead you to amazing results. Pike serves as the perfect example.

‘She’s really very all-in with everything she does. Once she’s in, she’s in,’ Ms Lawson said.
