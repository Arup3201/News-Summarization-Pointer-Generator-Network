A Swedish politician who wanted to show his new tattoo to followers on a social media site accidentally revealed far more than he intended.

Lars Ohly, former leader of Sweden's Left Party, and supporter of Liverpool Football Club, posted a picture of the liver bird tattooed on his leg.

What he failed to notice was that his genitals were visible in the background.

Mr Ohly, 56, quickly removed the picture after posting it on Instagram, but couldn't stop the avalanche of comments in social media.

Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, of the rival Moderate Party joked: 'Congratulations - finally, after all these years you have made a genuine public breakthrough.'

Mr Ohly made light of the embarrassment and said he would be more careful when he posts online. 

'Ha, ha, I accidentally posted a picture
on Instagram that showed more than intended,' he said, according to the
AFP. 'Now corrected.'

In an interview with website The Local, Mr Ohly proved to be unashamed and said 'It's not very embarrassing really,' adding that he's had 'lots of nice reactions'.

After the incident he wrote on his Twitter account: 'Summer's wonderful. The willy picture is today's hot topic. Completely by accident, though. The future will see a more thorough uploading review process.'

He later wrote: 'Oh, how many new followers I've got on Instagram today (and how disappointed they're going to be).'
