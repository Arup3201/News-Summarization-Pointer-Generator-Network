As Angel Quiles smiles down at his tiny daughter feeding on her bottle, it is nothing short of a miracle that he is holding the healthy baby girl in his arms.

The proud father had his world turned upside down on October 15 when he received a call from a hospital in St Petersburg, Florida to say that his pregnant wife, Jenny, had been in a car accident.

At first he thought she had been driving her car so he was stunned to learn that she had been on a crosswalk on her way to a doctor's appointment when she was hit by a tow truck.

While his unborn baby daughter was not injured in the crash, doctors needed to put his wife, who was seven months pregnant, in a coma to help with her traumatic brain injury.

Proud dad: Angel Quiles is pictured feeding his newborn daughter, Angel Noemi, at his parents home in Tarpon Springs, Florida. The little girl was born two weeks after her mother was hit by a truck and put in a coma

Two weeks later, she started having contractions and doctors delivered baby Angel Noemi by C-section. She weighed a tiny 6lbs at birth but was otherwise healthy.

A week later, on November 7, she returned home - without her mother.

Jenny Quiles, 36, has now woken up and remains in a rehabilitation center with serious brain injuries.

But her husband, 35, told the St Petersburg Tribune that he does not think she recognizes her daughter, whom she has met and kissed.

'I don't think she recognizes the baby as to be her baby,' he said. 'I think she has an idea. We just don't know if she really knows.'

Jenny appears to respond to conversation and can say some words and answer basic questions, but she will have to relearn how to speak and try to recover her memory, the Tribune reported. 

Meeting: Jenny Quiles kisses her baby daughter in hospital but Angel is not sure if his wife, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash a month ago, understands that the little girl is hers

'She's like a three-year-old,' her husband said. 'She's learning how to say her ABC's again.'

It is a battle he could never have anticipated.

'It's a lot of stress,' he said. 'I'm just going day by day and trying to do what I can on a daily basis. I'm exhausted, mentally drained... Now that the baby is home I can concentrate a little bit more on Jenny.'

He is hoping she'll be able to come home by the end of the year but doctors said it's more likely she'll return in February or March, he said. 

Angel has taken time off his jobs as a medical assistant at assisted living facilities and a manager for an irrigation department under the Family and Medical Leave Act.

He is trying to raise funds for his wife's care and has set up a gofundme page.  

Together: Jenny, who was 33 weeks pregnant when she was hit, and Angel Quiles married last year

Tragic: Jenny, left and right in hospital, is still battling a traumatic brain injury and struggling to talk

Police said that Mrs Quiles was crossing the road on the yellow light when the truck driver, Shaun Downing, hit her. Downing has been charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian.

In a bizarre twist, the accident unfolded just weeks before Angel Quiles witnessed another crash in which a 21-year-old woman was fatally hit by a car as she rode her scooter.

Susie Stone was thrown into a ditch in Dunedin and Quiles ran to her and prayed with her before she passed away. 

'All she said after I prayed with her was, 'Tell my mom I'm going to be OK, and give her a hug for me',' Quiles, 35, told WPTV. 'I just began to cry when I saw her take her last breath.'

On Friday, he met with Stone's heartbroken parents to comfort them and pass on her dying wish. 

Loss: Last week, Quiles was there when 21-year-old Susie Stone, pictured, was knocked off her scooter by a car. He ran to her side and held her as she passed away on the side of the road

Heartbreaking: Quiles met Susie's parents last week to pass on her final message to them

'I told her, 'Sorry, I wish I could have done more',' said Quiles. 'She said that Susie's a beautiful girl who loved life.'

Stone's mother said that she was glad her daughter had an angel by her side. 

The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said that drugs, alcohol and reckless driving were not factors in the crash and that the driver, 24-year-old Taylor Roppolo, has not been charged.

The Quiles family has set up a gofundme page to raise funds for Jenny's medical care.
