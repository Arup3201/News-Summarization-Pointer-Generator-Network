A van belonging to a Michigan-based physician who bore the notorious nickname 'Dr. Death' has been found at a pawn shop.

Dr. Jack Kevorkian used the 'Deathmobile', a 1970s VW Minibus while assisting in several deaths, including the poisoning of an Alzheimer's patient that launched his public effort in 1990.

It is being stored at a pawn ship in Southfield, Detroit, where Les Gold of American Jewelry & Loan bought it for $20,000.

Kevorkian served eight years in prison for second-degree murder after administering a lethal injection rather than helping the patient do it himself

The bus is currently sitting at the shop on layaway - the new owner, a local businessman, is paying $25,000 for the bus, reported CBS Detroit.

'There’s the registration’ we have his driver’s license, we have the pictures,' said Mr Gold.

'We have every document to show that this was actually the van that he used for assisted suicide.'

Dr Kevorkian was released from prison in 2007 after serving eight years for a second-degree murder conviction after assisting in the 1998 death of a 52-year-old Michigan man with Lou Gehrig's disease.

His parole came under the condition that he would not offer suicide advice to any other person.

He said his ultimate goal was to create 'obitoriums', where people would go to die - and doctors could harvest their organs.

He rose to infamy in the 1990s with his homemade 'suicide machines', which he drove to patients in a rusting VW van.

He inserted a needle into the patient's arm, then they pressed a lever to release the fatal chemicals.

The first assisted suicide he made public was in 1990, when Janet Adkins, 54, became the first person to use the machine at her home in Portland.

But his luck ran out in 1998, when he taped himself injecting Thomas Youk, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, with lethal chemicals.

The tape was then broadcast on CBS's 60 Minutes, and led to his conviction.

Speaking on the programme, he said: 'The issue's got to be raised to the level where it is finally decided.'

He was charged four times with murder, but three juries acquitted him and then a third case collapsed in a mistrial.

As the state tried desperately to stop him, Dr Kevorkian likened himself to Martin Luther King and Gandhi and called prosecutors Nazis, his critics religious fanatics.

He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in costume, called doctors who didn't support him 'hypocritical oafs' and challenged authorities to stop him or make his actions legal.

He once said: 'Somebody has to do something for suffering humanity. I put myself in my patients' place. This is something I would want.'

In an interview recorded from prison, he later admitted he regretted his actions 'a little'.

He said: 'It was disappointing because what I did turned out to be in vain.

'And my only regret was not having done it through the legal system, through legislation, possibly.'

After his release from jail, he revelled in his newfound celebrity. In 2010, his life was chronicled in 2010 telefilm You Don't Know Jack, starring Al Pacino as Dr Kevorkian.

The film, which also stars Susan Sarandon and John Goodman, follows Dr Kevorkian as he builds the second of his suicide devices, the 'Mercy Machine', which employed a gas mask fed by a container of carbon monoxide.

Pacino won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for his portrayal of the doctor, who sat smiling in the audience as the actor paid tribute to him in his acceptance speech, saying it was a pleasure 'to try to portray someone as brilliant and interesting and unique.'

But although he liked the film, Dr Kevorkian had little hope it would help inspire a new generation of assisted-suicide campaigners.

He said: 'You'll hear people say, "well, it's in the news again, it's time for discussing this further." No it isn't. It's been discussed to death.

'There's nothing new to say about it. It's a legitimate ethical medical practice as it was in ancient Rome and Greece.'

In 2008, he ran for Congress as an independent, receiving just 2.7 per cent of the vote in the suburban Detroit district.

He said his experience showed the party system was 'corrupt and has to be completely overhauled from the bottom up'.

In 2011, he died peacefully and pain-free from ongoing kidney disease, aged 83.

In 2010 online auction site eBay removed a listing for the van saying the sale would violate the company's policy against the sale of murder-related collectables.

Mayer Morganroth, Kevorkian's friend and lawyer at the time said Kevorkian turned the van in to his own auto shop for scrap in 1997 and that he was upset it had been put up for auction.

'Jack never sold it, never got a dime for it,' Morganroth said.

'Jack believed it was destroyed.'
