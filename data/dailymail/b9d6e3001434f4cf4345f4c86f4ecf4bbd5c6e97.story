This is the shocking moment two soldiers battered a pair of Royal Marine Commandos - leaving one of them blinded in one eye.

Alexander Thompson and William Press kicked and punched marines Martin Jones and Ray Simmons in a brutal and sustained attack following a booze-fuelled night out.

The squaddies, from the Royal Logistic Corps in Wiltshire, were jailed for a total of 14 years for the 40 second unprovoked attack.

Brutal: CCTV images capture the moment Alexander Thompson and William Press beat two Royal Marines outside a Plymouth nightclub

Police have now released footage of the attack which took place outside a Plymouth nightclub in December 2010.

Thompson, 25, can be seen on the left of the CCTV footage and is filmed repeatedly punching and kicking marine Martin Jones who drops to his knees after the first blow.

The soldier is seen launching at least seven kicks to the former Stonehouse-based commando, leaving him blind in one eye.

At one stage Thompson is so frenzied and out of control he falls on his backside after kicking the commando with such force.

Merciless: The sustained attack continues as Marines Martin Jones and Ray Simmons lay motionless on the floor

Meanwhile 26-year-old William Press is captured punching and kicking Ray Simmons.

Mr Simmons, of 30 Commando fell to the floor after the first punch with father-of-one Press continuing the attack - breaking away just once to punch Mr Jones in the head.

He then returns to Mr Simmons who is laid on the floor and resumes the violent assault.

In one final kick, which Press himself described as 'disgusting', he boots Mr Simmons in the face and the marine immediately loses consciousness.

Security officers place Mr Simmons in the recovery position as he lay on the floor.

Mr Jones gets up with assistance from a passer by and immediately tends to his friend who is still on the ground.

The assault prompted a judge to issue a stark warning to young men in Plymouth, Devon, 'looking for a fight'.

Recorder
Geoffrey Still said: 'Twelve years imprisonment is the starting point 
which from now on should be well known to young men in Plymouth looking 
for a fight.'

Thompson 
and Press were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at Plymouth 
Crown Court and were jailed for eight years and six years respectively.

Sentencing Thompson and Press, Geoffrey Still said: 'The aggravating factors of this case are self evident.

'One victim ended up having lost an eye and a badly broken up face, the other could have easily ended up the same way as he was kicked whilst unconscious and immobile.'

He condemned the two soldiers for the 'alcohol and adrenaline fuelled' attack, adding the victims were 'defenceless' and at their 'mercy'.

An Army spokesman said: 'In line with normal procedures, when a custodial sentence is awarded, the unit will usually apply for the discharge of the soldier or soldiers involved.'
