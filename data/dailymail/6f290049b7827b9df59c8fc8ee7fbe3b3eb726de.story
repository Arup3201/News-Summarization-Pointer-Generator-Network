An inquest in to the death of Peaches Geldof will be opened next week - with a cause of death expected to be released

An inquest will be opened into the death of Peaches Geldof next week, it has been confirmed.

The 25-year-old mother of two, daughter of Sir Bob Geldof, was found dead at her country home earlier this month in what was described by police as a 'non-suspicious' and 'sudden unexplained' death.

A post mortem carried out by a Home Office Pathologist days after she died proved inconclusive and samples of her blood and tissue were sent off to a laboratory to be tested for any possible toxins.

It is understood those results have now been returned to North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch who will open an inquest into Peaches's death next Thursday, May 1.

The hearing is only expected to last around 10 minutes.

A spokesman for Mr Hatch said a statement from a senior police officer will be heard and the coroner will release the cause of death.

A date for a full inquest into the model and TV presenter's death is due to be set some time in late July, the spokesman added.

The body of Peaches was found on April 7 at the home she shared in Wrotham, Kent, with her husband Tom Cohen, and their two young sons, Astala, 23 months, and 11-month-old Phaedra.

At the funeral service in the village of Davington, near Faversham, Peaches' body was carried into church in a poignantly-decorated coffin which included a picture of her young family.

Her father Sir Bob Geldof is thought to have led tributes in front of a host of well-known personalities, including Sarah Ferguson, supermodel Kate Moss and former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman.

The church, St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence, was where Ms Geldof married musician Mr Cohen in 2012. It was also where her television presenter mother Paula Yates married Geldof in 1986.

Yates' funeral was held there after she died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41.

Former Boomtown Rats singer Geldof has previously paid tribute to his daughter alongside his partner Jeanne Marine and Ms Geldof's sisters Fifi Trixibelle, Pixie and Tiger, saying she was the 'wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.'

He added: 'Writing ‘was’ destroys me afresh. What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable?

'We loved her and will cherish her forever. How sad that sentence is.

'Tom and her sons Astala and Phaedra will always belong in our family, fractured so often, but never broken. Bob, Jeanne, Fifi, Pixie and Tiger Geldof.'

Her husband Tom Cohen said in a statement: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts every day.'
