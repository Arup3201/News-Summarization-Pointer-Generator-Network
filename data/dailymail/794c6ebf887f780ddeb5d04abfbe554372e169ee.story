A story about Batman is not the usual Twitter material of the Vatican.

So when a tweet appeared with the 
headline 'Holy switcheroo! Batman has grown bitter, more vengeful with the years,' it was somewhat legitimately assumed that their account had been hacked.

But two Vatican officials today said the site had not been hacked, and that the reason for the unusual posting was an 'internal system failure' due to a non-native English speaker posting the story on the website.

Raised interest: A story about Batman running on one of the Vatican's main Twitter accounts and the website of its communications office raising concerns it might have been hacked

Batman link: The Twitter link went through to this webpage

'Admittedly some people might have been thrown off by the headline,' said Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke.

The tweet went through to the website of
the Pontifical Council
for Social Communications which was running at story with the headline 
'Holy Switcheroo: Batman has grown bitter, more vengeful with 
the years.'

Monsignor Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican's social communications office, said the office's website, runs stories about communications issues and regularly takes copy from Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Once a story is posted, he explained, it generates an automatic tweet on the office's Twitter handle (at)pccs_va.

'I thought we had been hacked to be honest,' he said. But further investigation yielded a simpler explanation.

All eyes: Pope Francis reads his speech during an audience with ambassadors from the 180 countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See

Call: Today Pope Francis for more dialogue with Islam in his speech in front of the delegates

Captive: Pope Francis reads his speech during an audience with ambassadors

The other stories on the website are much more church-oriented in nature.

On Thursday, they included Pope 
Francis' explanation of how he decided on calling himself Francis, the 
address to the media by the head of the social communications office 
about coverage of the papal conclave, and a story about registration 
being open for a congress on the role of the media in promoting peace.

Earlier this week, the Twitter account of a senior Vatican official was hacked.

Meanwhile today
Pope Francis called for more dialogue with Islam and offered an 
olive branch to China and other countries that don't have diplomatic 
relations with the Holy See.

Strong words: Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions 'particularly dialogue with Islam'

Vision: The Pope advocated more interaction between different faiths as a means of promoting peace

Delivery: In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French

In his first foreign policy address as pope, Francis delivered his remarks in Italian rather than the traditional French - another indication that the Argentine-born pope is less than comfortable speaking languages other than Italian and his mother-tongue Spanish.

The occasion was an audience with ambassadors from the 180 countries that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, in which Francis explained he would work for peace, the poor and to "build bridges" between peoples. He noted that even his title "pontiff" means bridge-builder.

Francis said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions "particularly dialogue with Islam" and to deepen the church's outreach to atheists.

Co-operation: The Vatican said that Al-Azhar's chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation

Greeting: Pope Francis greets Francesco Maria Greco Italian ambassador today

The Vatican's relations with Islam hit several bumps during Pope Benedict XVI's papacy: He outraged Muslims with a 2006 speech quoting a Byzantine emperor as saying some of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings were 'evil and inhuman.'

And in 2011, the pre-eminent institute of Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world, Cairo's Al-Azhar institute, froze dialogue with the Vatican to protest Benedict's call for greater protection of Christians in Egypt.

However, the Vatican said Friday that Al-Azhar's chief imam, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayyib, sent a message of congratulations to Francis for his election and hoped for cooperation. That's a possible sign of a thaw in relations with the arrival of a pope whose interfaith outreach while archbishop of Buenos Aires has been well-documented.

Future: Francis also said he wanted to begin a 'journey' with countries that don't yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican

Jovial: Pope Francis smiles as he greets foreign diplomats today

Respect: Pope Francis welcomes the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I during a private audience at the Vatican

History: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was the first patriarch of Constantinople to attend a papal inauguration since 1054 when the eastern and western halves of Christendom split in the so-called 'Great Schism'

Francis also said he wanted to begin a 'journey' with countries that don't yet have diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

Benedict had made improving relations with China a priority, given the millions of faithful who belong to China's underground Catholic Church, but tensions remain particularly over the appointment of bishops. China insists on naming them, while the Vatican says only the pope can name bishops.

China congratulated Francis for his election but said establishing formal relations would depend on the Vatican cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan and ceasing activities Beijing considers as interference in its internal affairs - a reference to bishops' appointments.

The Holy See also doesn't have diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. The latest country added to its list of diplomatic recognition was South Sudan, just last month.
