Beaming happily, these are the twins who have defied all the odds to celebrate their first birthday today. 

It is a milestone their parents feared  they would never see – for Rosie and  Ruby Formosa were born conjoined and  owe their lives to the skill of surgeons who separated them.

Their mother Angela was 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed that the twins were joined.

Double delight: Ruby, left, and Rosie Formosa, right, were conjoined at their abdomens at birth last year. They were separated by surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital the following day

Happy: Angela and Daniel Formosa hold their daughters Ruby, left, and Rosie, right. They will celebrate their joint first birthdays today

She and her husband Daniel prepared themselves for the worst after doctors, who at that stage could not tell where the babies were connected, initially gave the girls a low chance of survival.

Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births, but two thirds are stillborn or die very soon afterwards.

Rosie and Ruby were delivered early, at 34 weeks, by caesarean section at University College Hospital in London. Weighing 5lb 3oz each, they were joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine.

A life-threatening blockage meant they were transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital the following day for emergency surgery to separate them.

The operation took five hours and, thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses, was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later.

As she prepared to celebrate the twins’ birthday, Mrs Formosa, 32, said: ‘When I was pregnant I couldn’t see us getting this far.

Proud: Their mother Angela said she did not think they would 'get this far'

‘I was taking each day as it came. I am over the moon. It’s so lovely seeing them doing normal things and being happy when you didn’t even expect to have them.’

The bond between the girls is so strong they are seldom far from each other’s side, whether dressed in matching outfits in their double pushchair or crawling around having fun.

‘They follow each other round the house crawling. They are very close,’ said Mrs Formosa, of Bexleyheath, Kent, who also has older daughter, Lily, five, with her 37-year-old taxi driver husband.

‘They’re trying to stand up on all the furniture and they’re playing with toys and taking toys off one another.

'They’re very bubbly, very happy, they are very determined, but we knew that from the start really.

Miracle: The operation to separate the twins took five hours and, thanks to the team of 15 doctors and nurses, was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later

‘They’ve never really been apart so I don’t know whether they’re inseparable or not but they’ll play independently and then they’ll look for one another.’

There are clear differences, though. ‘Ruby especially loves her daddy, she’ll see him and will start kicking her legs and jumping up and down,’ Mrs Formosa said. ‘Ruby is a daddy’s girl and Rosie is more of a mummy’s girl.’

The twins will need regular check-ups throughout childhood, but the hospital is ‘happy’ with their progress.

Rosie and Ruby’s birthday party will be held tomorrow, and for now all their parents have to worry about – apart from putting up the balloons – is persuading family and friends not to bring the girls identical gifts.

‘It’s a bit silly to have two of everything,’ said Mrs Formosa.
