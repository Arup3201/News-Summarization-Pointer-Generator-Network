A photographer has claimed he saw a driver dozing at the wheel of a moving 30-wagon freight train.

The picture was taken of the bearded driver, who appeared to be fast asleep in the cab of his Class 66 locomotive at Doncaster station in South Yorkshire, on September 11.

The photographer said: ‘The freight train had been waiting for 
some time to come through the station and it was moving slowly - maybe 
he had just closed his eyes for a few seconds.

Dozing off? Photographer took the picture of the bearded driver, who appears to be fast asleep in the cab of the Class 66 locomotive at Doncaster station in South Yorkshire on September 11

'I can't say he was definitely asleep but the photo looks that way. Who knows, but he looks asleep.

'The locomotive was a Class 66 and was pulling about 30 wagons. I didn't notice the fact his eyes look like they were shut until I looked at the images.’

Doncaster station, managed by East 
Coast, is a major northern railway hub, with eight platforms and direct 
links to the likes of Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Manchester, Newcastle 
and Reading.

In March 1951 
there was a major rail crash next to the station that killed 14 
passengers and injured 12 after eight coaches on a train to London 
derailed, and one of them crashed into a bridge.

Up close: Photographer said the train had been waiting to come through the station and it was moving slowly

Freightliner Group - which operated the train and runs rail freight services across the 
UK, Poland and Australia - said it 'takes all reported incidents seriously and will fully investigate accordingly'.

'If (the Driver Safety Device) is not constantly monitored and acknowledged by the driver whilst a train is in motion the system will automatically apply the train brakes'

Freightliner spokesman

A spokesman added to 
MailOnline: 'However it is virtually impossible for a sleeping driver to
set a stationary train into motion as it requires the active operation 
of a power handle. 

'This class of locomotive (66) are 
fitted with a Driver Safety Device (DSD) part of which is a vigilance 
system, that if it is not constantly monitored and acknowledged by the driver whilst a train is in motion the system will automatically apply 
the train brakes.'
