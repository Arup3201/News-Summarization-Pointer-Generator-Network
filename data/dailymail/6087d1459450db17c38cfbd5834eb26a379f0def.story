Raven-Symoné has blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby during their years on The Cosby Show.

'I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! [sic]' the 28-year-old wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.

'I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of!,' she added. 'Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!'

'Keep me out of this!' Raven-Symoné (pictured earlier this month) has blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby (pictured on Monday) during their years on The Cosby Show

Symone was referencing a report posted earlier this week on fake news site Hip-Hop Hangover, claiming the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when they acted together on the hit sitcom.

The website, which calls itself 'a gossip parody and satirical publication', alleged the assault took place after the series finale in 1992, when she was around six years old.

Symone starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter Olivia from 1989 till 1992 (the show started airing in 1984).

Symone is the first star from the show to be brought into the current sexual abuse scandal surrounding the beloved star.

Lachele Covington, who played a waitress on the CBS sitcom, filed a police report in 2000 alleging that Cosby  'put her hand under his T-shirt and guided it south toward his sweatpants.'

However, the actor reportedly was never questioned or charged.

Five women recently have come forward and accused Cosby of sexual assault.

Supermodel Janice Dickinson is the latest to go public, alleging he drugged and raped her.

Dickinson gave a TV interview on Tuesday in which she alleged Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show, offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps.

That is one of the last things she remembers of the evening.

'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' she told Entertainment Tonight.

'I remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs.'

Dickinson says her last memory of the night was of Cosby taking off his robe and climbing on top of her, and that the next morning she remembers 'a lot of pain.'

The supermodel claims the incident occurred in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982.

However, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, branded the allegation a 'complete lie.' 

She also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel, but that Cosby and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details. 

But Singer also flatly rejected this claim, saying: 'You can confirm with Harper Collins that she never claimed that Mr Cosby raped her, that no attorney representing Bill Cosby tried to kill the story... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about Bill Cosby in her book.'

In a statement, reported by NBC News, he added: 'There is documentary proof that Janice Dickinson is fabricating and lying about Bill Cosby.'  

Dickinson did, however, detail some of her evening in Lake Tahoe with Cosby in the book, though telling a very different story.

She said she was drinking with Cosby at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired, at which point he slammed his door in her face.

The aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story.  

She says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do.'

As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words.

'How dare you,' she says.

'Go f*ck yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.'

Bombshell: At the time of the alleged rape, Dickinson (pictured in the 1980s) was one of the biggest models in the world

This comes as a third women, Joan Tarshis, came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by Cosby in Los Angeles back in 1969.

She called him a 'very, very sick man who needs help.'

Another of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, told MailOnline she was just 17 when he 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.'

Cosby, who refuses to comment on the allegations, did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior.

His lawyer John P. Schmitt has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.'
