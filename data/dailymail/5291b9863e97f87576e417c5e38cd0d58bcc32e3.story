Tributes have been paid to a rough sleeper who died when a tree fell on a tent she was in during the storms and floods that struck parts of England and Wales.

Michelle Conroy, 21, died and two other people - men aged 27 and 35 - were injured when the large spruce came down on Saturday night in Western Way, Exeter.

Emergency services managed to free Ms Conroy but she died later from her injuries in hospital.

Tragic: Michelle Conroy, 21, who died when she was hit by a falling tree in Exeter

Devon and Cornwall Police said she was in a sleeping bag in a tent underneath the tree when it came down in what they described as a 'tragic incident'.

Tributes were left on Facebook to Ms Conroy, including from her partner David Browning.

He wrote: 'RIP babygal I will never ever forget you.

'You will always be the first gal I ever loved and you will always be in my heart but it should never have happened to you.

'You were too young we still had a whole life to live together. And thanks to all my friends for the support and I'm sorry to all Michelle's family and friends.

'It was a tragic accident xxxx.'

The tree which fell in Exeter killing Michelle Conroy who, friends said, was only living on the streets to be with her homeless boyfriend

Michelle Conroy's boyfriend David Browning, 27, originally from Newton Abbot, was one of two men who were also injured

Mary Parsons wrote: 'RIP Michelle Jane Conroy.

'I know I should have been there for you more and for that I am sorry.

'You have so many friends who will think/miss you all the time, sleep well Michelle xxxxxxxxxxx.'

The Rev Canon Anna Norman-Walker, a Diocesan Missioner at Exeter Cathedral, said Ms Conroy was a regular visitor to the Friday Night Cafe at St Petcock's Church.

'Unlike many of our visitors, Michelle wasn't dependant on drugs or alcohol, neither did she have any significant mental health issues, but rather she was a young person who was a lonely soul with a sad, broken childhood who simply couldn't sustain an independent life,' she told the Express and Echo.

'The street community were her family, friends and support network.

'We are all terribly sad to have lost her from our ‘Friday family'.'

Ms Conroy's family live away from Devon and are due to travel to Exeter on Friday to formally identify her.
