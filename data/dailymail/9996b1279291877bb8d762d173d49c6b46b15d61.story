Injured Vincent Kompany will miss Belgium's friendly with Iceland on Wednesday after being left out of the team named by manager Marc Wilmots on Tuesday.

Kompany, Belgium's captain, is recovering from the calf injury which ruled him out of Manchester City's 2-2 draw at Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League on Saturday.

Belgium are hopeful, though, that he will be fit to face leaders Wales in Sunday's Euro 2016 Group B qualifier in Brussels.
