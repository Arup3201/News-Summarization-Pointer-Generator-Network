Mayflies have started to emerge from the Mississippi River in swarms so large that they show up on radar like thunderstorms.

The insects emerge in large numbers to 
mate, lay eggs and die, all in less than 48 hours. They leave behind a slimy mess which has been blamed for at least one car crash this week in Wisconsin.

The National Weather Service captured a
 massive swarm on radar on Sunday night as the flies came out of the 
river and drifted north on the wind.

The radar system picks up energy 
reflected off the flies, with the image's intensity reflecting the 
density of the bugs.

A loop 
recorded on Sunday shows yellow patches directly over the river that 
morph into a green band as the flies drift north. The bugs become blue 
dots as they disperse.

A second, smaller swarm recorded on Thursday night starts as a green band before exploding like fireworks into blue dots.

The flies hatch and then spend a year 
burrowed into the sediment on the bottom of the river that serves as a 
border between Wisconsin and Minnesota. They emerge the next summer to 
mate, lay eggs and die, all in less than 48 hours.

'Almost every night in the summer, there's some sense on the radar that there's something coming off the river,' said Dan Baumgardt, science and operations officer for the National Weather Service in La Crosse.

'We don't know what kind of bug it is ... until we have people calling or saying, "Oh my gosh, there's mayflies all in the La Crosse area."'

The weather service typically records several swarms each year from June through August.

Air and water temperatures have been usually cool this year, helping explain why Sunday's emergence was the first big one this summer, said Mark Steingraeber, a U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service biologist.

Attracted by light, mayflies congregate on roads, bridges and other surfaces in piles that can be nearly two feet high. Cars crush the flies, releasing liquid in the females' eggs and making roads slick.

Two people were injured on Sunday in 
Trenton Township in western Wisconsin when a car slid on a road covered 
by flies, crashed into a second car and then struck a van.

Flies that aren't crushed spend 24 hours shedding exoskeletons in a final stage of development before taking to the air again to mate. The females then seek water to lay their eggs.

'If they happen to come across a cup of beer, they will deposit them in a cup of beer,' said Steingraeber, who needs volunteers to help track the flies' appearance for his research.

Adult flies die after laying their eggs. Within hours, their offspring hatch in the river, and the cycle begins again.

The inserts are sensitive to oxygen levels 
and pollutants in the river and serve as 'sentinels' for scientists and 
others concerned about water quality, said Steingraeber.

Mayflies disappeared from a 70-mile 
area south of the Twin Cities in the 1920s and didn't reappear in 
significant numbers again until 1978, when wastewater treatment and 
others actions taken under the Clean Water Act began to have an impact.
