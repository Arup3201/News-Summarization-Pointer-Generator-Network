My my, haven't they grown!

A loving father has caught on camera a year in the life of his young triplets that charts their development from babies to toddlers in a matter of seconds.

Lee Parkinson, from Trafford, Manchester, filmed his children, Lily, Harry and Charlie every day for a year and then used just one second of footage from each day to create a six minute 'time-lapse' film.

The film follows the youngsters, who will celebrate their third birthday in April, as they grow from 20-month-old babies into boisterous toddlers.

Mr Parkinson, a teacher at Davyhulme Primary School, said: 'I decided to create this video to show that a single second can take you back to that minute, hour or day.

'We don't need to miss out on exciting experiences because we are so desperate to film it all on a mobile.

'I watched it back after the first month and there was a lot of them in the bath or going to bed and it made me make the effort to come home earlier and spend more quality time with them.

'It was incredible watching it back to see just how time flies and how rapidly children grow up.'

Mr Parkinson, who lives in Urmston with wife Claire and the triplets' older brother Callum, added: 'Even though it's only one second, you can really start to see how their language and personalities develop.

'It's not my unique idea and there are even apps to do this, but it's different with three of them.'

The triplets, who were naturally conceived at odds of 10,000 to one, were born prematurely on Mother's Day 2011.

They were rushed 20 miles by ambulance from St Mary's in Manchester to Wigan so they could all be cared for in the same place.
