Real Sociedad midfielder Esteban Granero has backed new manager David Moyes to give the club a 'leap in quality' and says the Scot's lack of experience in Spain will not be an issue.

Moyes was named as the new man in charge at the La Liga club earlier this week as he makes his return to football following his unceremonious sacking from Manchester United in April.

The 51-year-old mulled over Real Sociedad's offer for a week before deciding to take the plunge into the unknown, but former QPR midfielder Granero is confident Moyes can be a big success.

'We have confidence in his ability, his experience and his standards, and we are confident that he is going to give us a leap in quality,' Granero told AS.

'We hope that his time in La Liga will be as long and as successful as his spell in England.

'He is a very experienced coach, and I remember that playing against Everton was very difficult and that they had very clear ideas.

'I am convinced that Moyes knows the Spanish league as well as we do. You have to look at his career and know him to understand that he is crazy about football.'

Granero, who joined Sociedad on a permanent deal in the summer after spending last season on loan at the club, is not concerned about the language barrier.

'I don’t think it’s something that will be a problem. I’m sure he will learn the language soon.'
