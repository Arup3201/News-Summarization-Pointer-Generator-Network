Independence for Scotland will undermine the Royal Navy and cost the Ministry of Defence billions of pounds, Britain’s military grandees warned yesterday.

In an unprecedented alliance, 12 of the country’s most senior defence and intelligence veterans have written to Alex Salmond condemning plans to scrap Trident if there is a ‘Yes’ vote in September.

The First Minister’s controversial proposals would put the UK’s nuclear deterrent ‘in jeopardy’ and cast a ‘dark shadow’ over international relations, they said.

Deterrent: Trident submarine Vanguard off Scotland

The MoD would be forced to shift the submarine-based deterrent from Scotland, incurring huge costs which would inevitably eat into the defence budget and hit the Navy.

It would also potentially scupper Scottish National Party hopes of joining Nato, according to the former heads of the Army, Navy and the RAF.

Fellow nuclear powers France and America, in particular, would be ‘concerned’ by the ‘unacceptable’ development because the military alliance has British-based nuclear weapons as a cornerstone of its protection.

The former defence chiefs also warned that forcing the removal of the Trident nuclear missile system from its base at Faslane on the Clyde would cost ‘many, if not most’ of the 7,000 Scottish jobs there.

The letter is the most significant intervention yet amid an ongoing row over the SNP’s defence strategy for a separate Scotland.

Mr Salmond has drawn up plans for a £2.5billion annual budget for defence and security. That compares with £35billion for defence alone spent each year across the UK.

Nationalists claim they can spend less because Trident missiles would be removed from Faslane by the end of the decade, although the SNP recently backed Nato membership – and still wants the protection of its first-strike nuclear capacity.

Last year, Nato chiefs privately agreed that it may be possible to fast-track membership for an independent Scotland, but – crucially – only if there are no unresolved disputes with other countries, such as the rest of the UK.

The letter to Mr Salmond has been written by Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff between 2009 and 2013.

It is also signed by four former chiefs of the defence staff, four other first sea lords and chiefs of naval staff, a former chief of the air staff, the former chief of the general staff who commanded the British forces in Iraq, General Sir Mike Jackson, and Britain’s most senior intelligence civil servant after the 9/11 terror attacks, Sir David Omand.

Sir Mark writes: ‘For the continuing UK such a demand [to remove Trident], not least in the timescale envisaged, would cause huge practical problems and upheaval for the Royal Navy and require massive additional expenditure – running into many billions of pounds – and would be deeply resented by many.

‘The negotiations with Westminster following a Yes vote, covering such vital matters as currency, financial settlements and re-allocating existing UK defence and other assets, can be expected to be complex and difficult. If the very future of the UK nuclear deterrent was also in the balance, it would inevitably sour those negotiations.’

Sir Mark’s letter warns of concerns if Scotland ‘pushed a unilateral nuclear disarmament agenda’.

He says: ‘Nato could hardly be expected to welcome a new member state whose government put in jeopardy the continued operation of the UK independent nuclear deterrent – a deterrent which protects not only the UK but all of Nato as well.’

He also criticises the Scottish government’s White Paper on independence. ‘[Nato] would view with alarm the suggestion of a constitutional ban on nuclear weapons in Scotland,’ he writes.

Sir Mark adds that ‘the very prospect of implementing the Scottish government’s policy would cast a dark shadow over the international reception given to a newly independent Scottish nation’.

Trident missiles are carried on four Vanguard-class nuclear-powered submarines. The UK government is committed to maintaining and renewing the submarine patrols.

A Scottish government spokesman said: ‘The estimated £170million that Scottish taxpayers contribute every year to the maintenance and running of Trident could be far better spent by prioritising our conventional defence needs.’
