A Montana woman who killed her husband-of-eight-days has been told she has no grounds to appeal her murder conviction.

Jordan Graham, 23, was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the 2013 murder of her husband Cody Johnson, 25, in Glacier National Park. 

Federal prosecutors have said the former nanny has no grounds to appeal after lying to officials and using trickery in a bid to conceal her crime.  

Staying in jail: Jordan Graham, pictured leaving court in 2013, has been told by prosecutors that she has no grounds to appeal after lying to officials and using trickery in a bid to conceal her crime

Graham admitted to killing Cody 
Johnson, 25, by pushing him to his death from a 300ft cliff in Glacier 
National Park on July 7, 2013.

His body was found at the bottom of the cliff three days after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker.

After she was sentenced
 last month to the maximum of 30 years, Graham tried - and failed - to 
withdraw her guilty plea - despite the fact her attorneys asked for a 
10-year sentence in exchange for change of plea.

Her defense attorney Michael Donahoe had 
previously said in a motion that her 'extremely reckless but 
unintentional act' only warranted 10 years in prison.

Her
 attorney's filing this week claims that Judge Molloy failed to take 
into account that accepting the plea meant she had not premeditated her 
new husband's death. Graham's defense team also claims that the judge made improper calculations when deciding on her sentence.

Lies: Jordan Graham, accompanied by members of her legal team in 2013, lied to friends and police officers and even fabricated an email exchange to cover up her crime

Details on how Judge Molloy calculated the 22-year-old's sentence were sealed.

Before he accepted her plea in December 2013, the judge asked Graham to tell him what happened.

Graham
 said she was having second thoughts about being 
married so young and that she and her husband went to the park to talk about it.

It
 wasn't planned, but she said it was 'definitely reckless with an 
extreme disregard' for life. Afterward, she ran back to where the car 
was parked.

She drove back home to Kalispell, 
about an hour away, without seeking help. She sent text messages to 
friends on the drive back - but told nobody what had just happened.

'At that moment, I was so scared, I didn't know what to do,' she said.

Johnson was reported missing on July 8 when he failed to show up for work.

Graham
 initially told investigators that Johnson left their house on July 7 with 
friends. But his friends testified they were suspicious of the story and
 suspected Graham played a role in his disappearance.

Graham showed police a fabricated 
email - purportedly from a friend of Johnson - that said Johnson was 
dead and to call off the search.

She
 later told Glacier rangers she had found Johnson's body near The Loop 
because it was a place he wanted to see before he died.

 Ultimately, 
Graham acknowledged she was with Johnson on the cliff after 
investigators confronted her with a security camera photo of the couple 
entering the park.

Graham was sentenced last March after a U.S. judge  rejected her request to withdraw the guilty plea that came as part of a deal with prosecutors that saw them dismiss a first-degree murder charge.

Graham last October appealed her conviction, arguing prosecutors engaged in misconduct by publicly labeling her a sociopath, distorted facts and acted in a vindictive manner toward her.

Prosecutors argued in legal documents filed on Wednesday that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should reject Graham's attempts to overturn her conviction and sentence since her claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness 'are based on the kind of supposition that will not sustain a valid motion.'

Prosecutors also contended that Graham not only killed her husband in cold blood, but she later lied about it to investigators and even created a fake email in attempt to cover up the crime.
