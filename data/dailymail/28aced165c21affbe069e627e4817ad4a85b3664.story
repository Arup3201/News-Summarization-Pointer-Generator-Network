A naked, malnourished four-year-old boy found inside an apartment in New Jersey with the body of his dead mother had resorted to eating from a bag of sugar, police said Wednesday. 

The toddler’s first request after being examined, police said, was a grilled cheese sandwich and a juice.

His mother, identified as Kiana Workman, 38, from Brooklyn, was discovered dead Tuesday on the floor of her bedroom after maintenance workers at the apartment complex in northern New Jersey reported a foul odor.

Heartbreaking outcome: The decomposing body of 38-year-old Kiana Workman is being wheeled out of an apartment in Union, New Jersey, where she had remained for four days with her young son

Because the chain lock was on, police said, her son couldn't get out.

Officer Joseph Sauer said the boy was
naked but coherent and not crying when he kicked in the door and his 
partner lifted the youngster up by the arms and pulled him out of the 
overheated apartment.

‘The only way to describe the little 
boy was it was like a scene from World War II, from a concentration 
camp, he was that skinny. I mean, you could see all his bones,’ Sauer 
told The Associated Press.

The apartment in this city 15 miles 
west of New York belongs to Workman's 64-year-old mother, who is 
recuperating from a double hip replacement at a nursing center, said 
police, who could not track down any other relatives.

The boy, now in state custody, was taken to a hospital where he was treated for 
malnourishment and dehydration, police said.

‘Physically, he's fine. Whether there
are any mental problems later on ... I'm not a child expert,’ Police 
Director Daniel Zieser said.

The boy was not strong enough to open the refrigerator and was unable to open a can of soup.

'He made a statement to the officer 
that 'There's plenty of food in the refrigerator, but I couldn't open 
the door,' Zieser told ABC News.

Investigation: Police are looking into what killed the woman at this apartment in Union, New Jersey. Her body was found alongside her 4-year-old son, who was still alive despite not eating for five days

Mystery: Police have not identified the woman who was found here on Tuesday. She was said to be in her 20s and officers said they did not suspect foul play

'So that's kind of sad that nobody checked on him, no family members. It's sad, very sad.'

Police said he told them he had been eating from a bag of sugar.

The boy could not say how long his 
mother had been dead. Zieser said that Workman had ‘underlying health 
issues,’ but declined to elaborate.

Police said he put lotion on his 
mother, leaving behind handprints, in an attempt to make her feel 
better. Her decomposing body was discovered lying on a bad.

Officer Sylvia Dimenna, who traveled 
in the ambulance with the boy and stayed with him at the hospital, said 
he was very bright and articulate but tired.

Besides grilled cheese sandwiches, the little boy also said that he likes hot chocolate with marshmallows melting in the cup, NJ.com reported.

‘He said he missed his mommy,’ 
Dimenna said, adding that he was very quiet while watching Mickey Mouse 
cartoons at the hospital.

Police initially estimated she had 
been dead five days before the discovery was made, but Zieser said 
Wednesday it may have been two to three. Nobody had talked to her for 
about a week.

The boy weighed 26lbs, but at the age of four-and-a-half should have weighed at least 40lbs, Zieser said.

‘It's possible he was improperly cared for before the mother's death; we just don't know yet,’ Zieser said.

Recovering: The 4-year-old is being treated in hospital and said to be suffering from starvation and dehydration after the five day ordeal

The medical examiner will perform an 
autopsy Thursday to determine the cause and time of death. Police said 
they did not suspect foul play.

Police said they were getting calls from around the world from people offering to adopt the child or donate money or toys.

‘It's overwhelming,’ Zieser said.

‘I just hope everything works out for
the child,’ the police director said. ‘We're just going to take it one 
step at a time and do the best that we can for the child.'

Police said they were trying to find 
someone in the family capable of taking care of the boy, including a 
brother of Workman believed to live out West and other relatives, 
including a 21-year-old daughter.

But he said it would be up to the state's child welfare agency to determine where the child is placed.

The boy was released from Overlook 
Medical Center in Summit last night and was placed with a foster parent 
who is a registered nurse, according to News 12 New Jersey.
