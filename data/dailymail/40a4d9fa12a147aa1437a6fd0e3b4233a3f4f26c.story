David Warner was at the centre of an unsavoury incident during Australia's one-day international against India in Melbourne - and fined 50 per cent of his match fee. 

The 28-year-old Australian clashed with Rohit Sharma during the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the pair needed to be separated by umpires and other players.

The heated verbal exchange could not be heard on the television feed, but Warner appeared to repeatedly mouth the words 'speak English' towards the Indian batsman. 

David Warner and Rohit Sharma exchange words during Australia's clash with India in Melbourne

Warner was unhappy after India took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off Sharma's pads

Warner said on Sky Sports Radio: 'We play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it, sometimes you are going to get fined.

'We've just got to keep trying not to cross that line, because we're all about playing cricket the right way.

'When I went over to say something to him, he sort of said something in their language and I said "speak English" because, if you're going to say something, understand that theoretically I cannot speak Hindi,".

'I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English, therefore he did and I can't repeat what he said.

'I was in the wrong ... I shouldn't have engaged him.'  

The clash comes off the back of a four-match Test series between the teams that was filled with tension and bad blood.

The conflict came at the end of the 23rd over of India's innings after Sharma hit a delivery from James Faulkner to Warner at mid-off.

Sharma and Suresh Raina refused a single as Warner fielded the ball and threw to the wicketkeeper’s end.

Warner’s throw went through Sharma's leg with the Indian batsman's back turned and Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin then missed the ball.

Sharma and Raina then scampered through for an overthrow, much to the frustration of the home side. 

Australia thought the ball deflected off Sharma's pads and felt the Indian pair should not have taken an extra run.

Warner walked up the wicket to confront Sharma, by which stage Glenn Maxwell was already raising the issue with the Indian batsman.

The umpires and Raina stepped between Sharma and Warner and, as the Australian was walking away he appeared to say 'speak English' towards the Indian batsman a number of times. 

The verbal spat continued between Sharma and Shane Watson at the beginning of the next over

Sharma scored a century, but Australia chased their target of 268 to win the second match of the tri-series

The verbals continued between Sharma and Shane Watson at the beginning of the next over.

Sharma went on to score 138 as India reached 267 for eight at the end of their 50 overs.

Aaron Finch's 96 in reply anchored Australia's chase of 268 as they recorded a four-wicket victory in the second match of the tri-series having beaten England on Friday.
