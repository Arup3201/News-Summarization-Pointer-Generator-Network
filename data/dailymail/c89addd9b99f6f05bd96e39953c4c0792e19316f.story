Four teenage gang members have been jailed for life for killing a 15-year-old 
boy who was chased and stabbed to death by a 'hunting posse of boys on bicycles'.

Negus McLean was repeatedly stabbed until the blade of a large knife broke away from its handle after being targeted in a 'postcode' feud between rival north London gangs, the Old Bailey heard.

Billal Lariba, 18, Brandon Hamilton, 18, 
Tershan Edwards, 19, and 16-year-old Travis
Bowman were yesterday found guilty of his murder.

Judge John Bevan told them the 'ghastly' killing was 'cowardly beyond belief'.

Negus was said to have been a victim of a postcode rivalry between two teenage gangs which 
saw three stabbings in a week in neighbouring areas of north London.

The first two victims, involving rivals from the Enfield EN3 Get Money Gang and Edmonton N9's Dem Africans group, survived.

But Negus, a member of DA, died from his injuries following the attack by members of the GMG on April 10, 2011.

The court heard that after the murder Edwards wrote a series of vile rap lyrics glorifying knife attacks which Judge Bevan described as a 'hymn to knife violence.'

They included the chilling line: 'Stab a man up and then ask who's next.'

Simon Denison, QC, prosecuting, said: 'A group of seven boys from the 
GMG gang rode out of EN3 on bicycles, like a hunting posse, south into 
N9, in order to carry out that attack.'

Negus was riding his bike with some other lads when he was spotted, chased and killed.

Mr Denison added: 'Negus came off his bike and he was attacked. He was 
knocked to the ground and repeatedly stabbed in the chest and in his 
legs.

'A metal knife that was used to stab him was driven down into him with such force that the blade snapped off the handle.

'Negus was left lying on the pavement, blood pouring from his wounds. He
lost a lot of blood very quickly and died that evening in hospital.'

Negus's mother Ingrid said in a statement to the court: "My heart is 
broken. Negus died just before his 16th birthday. He did not get to 
finish school. There was no prom for him. I was picking out his coffin 
on his birthday.'

Of her son's killers, she said: 'I am angry and hate what they have 
done. It seems these young boys have no respect for life, even their 
own. One day, if they become parents they will think about Negus and the
pain they have caused.'

The judge lifted a court order banning the identification of the 16 
year-old as Travis Bowman, from Ashton Road, Enfield, and the 17 
year-old girl Yasmin Latif, who gave Hamilton a false alibi.

Bowman, who was only 14 at the time of the murder, came to the UK 
because of his family's problems with gang violence in Jamaica, the 
court heard.

GMG all day brudda that's the set, when you come thru my hood better 
show some respect,

Or my little Youngaz will push a blade thru your 
neck

Stab a man up and then ask who's next.

When I ride out no gun just my samuri, I'll chop him his head until he 
f****** dies

they stabbed me up once but they can't stab me f****** 
twice

Ima stab him in the back and leave him f****** paralised.'

All four were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's Pleasure. Hamilton
will serve at least 19 years before parole, Lariba 16 and a half years,
Edwards 17 years and Bowman 12 and a half years.

Latif was sentenced to 12 months detention and training order.

Judge Bevan  said: 'It seems to occur to none of the perpetrators
that an attack by seven or eight armed and masked on one is cowardly 
beyond belief.

'You feel able to operate in some sort of parallel universe in which 
robbery, theft, drugs and violence are acceptable, unless a member of 
you gang is the victim, in which case retaliation is necessary to 
preserve status and what is laughably called respect.

'This is all because of loyalty to a postcode. It simply creates a 
vicious circle of anger, misery and death. Lack of moral values lie at 
the heart of it and the picture painted before the jury over the last 
six weeks has been infinitely depressing.'

Lariba and Hamilton, both of Enfield, north London, Edwards, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, and 
Bowman, of Enfield, shouted as they left the dock to begin their sentence.
