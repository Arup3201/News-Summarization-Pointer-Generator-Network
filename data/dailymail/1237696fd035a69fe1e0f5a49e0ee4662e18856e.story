Defender Marcus Olsson insists Blackburn have still not given up hope of a late charge into the Sky Bet Championship play-offs and the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final place will not distract them from that aim.

Sunday's goalless draw at Anfield to earn a replay back at Ewood Park - where they have already dispatched Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke - may have improved their chances of booking a trip to Wembley.

However, they are likely to have at least five league matches to play before the expected return leg against the Reds in early April and, even though Rovers are 14 points adrift of the play-offs, Olsson stressed they have to give it one last push.

'We don't really think about the FA Cup,' he told Press Association Sport.

'We try to give 100 per cent every game as there is still a chance of getting into the play-offs but we have to concentrate in the last 11 games of the league.

'We have a big game at home to Liverpool which we will take on when it gets closer but going to Anfield, with them on form and being a strong team, will give us a boost.'

Rovers matched what fellow Championship sides Middlesbrough (in the Capital One Cup) and Bolton (FA Cup) have done this season in not getting beat in 90 minutes at Anfield.

They enjoyed the better of the play before the interval and - but for a brilliant save from Simon Mignolet - could have won the match with Alex Baptiste's header early in the second half.

That has given them hope they can claim another Premier League scalp at home in a few weeks' time.

'I think playing at Anfield we did well and at least deserved another chance at home,' Olsson added.

'We had two big chances to score, one of which the goalkeeper made an unbelievable save from, but we play at home now and we are strong there.

'We thought we could come here and shake them up a bit. We did very well as a team, defending all over the pitch with the midfielder's and (striker) Rudy Gestede as well.

'We didn't give them too many chances to create in 90 minutes and it was a good day.

'Rudy (top scorer this season with 14 goals) on his day will give any defender a hard time as he is good in the air and hopefully next game he will score against them.'
