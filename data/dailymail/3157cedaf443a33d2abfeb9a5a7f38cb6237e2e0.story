A model used stolen credit card details to pay for expensive cosmetic surgery, a court heard.

Faileigh Cooper, 23, allegedly resorted to fraud to pay for liposuction and lip enhancements.

When questioned about the invalid payments, she claimed the surgery had left her with a burnt arm so she was considering legal action, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Accused: Faileigh Cooper, 23, arrives at Southwark Crown Court with a friend. She allegedly resorted to fraud to pay for liposuction and lip enhancements

The part-time model went to the top clinic in Wimpole Street in central London for consultations on the treatment before handing over a £500 deposit.

After the treatment was carried out, Cooper and a man only known as ‘Aaron’ then repeatedly called the surgery to pay the remaining balance, with £5,250 coming from the stolen cards.

Prosecuting Bartholomew O’Toole said Cooper had hoped to improve her image for her modelling career.

‘What this case is about is using someone else’s credit card without their authority with a view to use that card to the extent of thousands of pounds,’ he said.

‘The background of this case was in the early part of 2011, when Miss Cooper decided to have cosmetic surgery.

‘She had made enquiries to a surgery 
about having liposuction and lip enhancements at a clinic called the Dr 
Alexandra Chambers Medical and Aesthetic Practice, on Wimpole Street, 
central London.

The prosecution said after meeting with Dr Alex Chambers, who later treated her, she decided on the procedures which were going to cost £6,850.

‘She was or is planning to do some modelling, which no doubt meant that her appearance was important to her,' said Mr O' Toole.

‘She
initially paid an £500 deposit, and then made the rest of the payments 
using credit cards, mostly or indeed exclusively on the phone,' he added.

Cooper
and ‘Aaron’ called the surgery 14 times between February 21 and 
February 23 last year using both legitimate and fraudulent cards to pay 
off the balance

‘A number of payments were made lawfully, and the crown say that the sum of £5,250 was made unlawfully without the authorisation of the card owners William Churchill and Constance Logan,' said  Mr O' Toole.

The clinic was later informed that the card payments were fraudulent, leaving them out of pocket.

Police were informed and Cooper claimed in her interview: ‘The surgery burnt my arm and I wasn’t very happy, and I was thinking of taking them to court.’

Mr O’Toole added: ‘The clinic had not heard one part of her claim.

‘When asked about Aaron she said that she was seeing him, but he was not her boyfriend, and she had met him less than 20 times after meeting him in a club.

‘She did not remember which club, know his surname or where he lived.

‘She said that she thought they were Aaron’s (credit) cards 100 per cent, and that she was desperate for the operation.

Cooper, of Battersea, southwest London, denies four counts of fraud.

The trial continues.

Practice: The clinic she attended is in London's Wimpole Street
