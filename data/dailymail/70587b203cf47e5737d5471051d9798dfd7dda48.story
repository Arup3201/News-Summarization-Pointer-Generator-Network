With her enormous, glassy eyes, purple hair and coquettish pose, this girl could have stepped from the scene of a Japanese anime film.

Anime fan Anastasiya Shpagina has transformed herself into a living cartoon character, complete with miniature waist, vividly-coloured hair, and a defined pout.

Originally from the Ukraine, the 19-year-old takes style inspiration from the cartoons and computer animations that have a huge following in Japan, and has even adopted a Japanese name - Fukkacumi.

Anime characters often feature huge eyes and heads that are disproportionately large in comparison to their body.

Shpagina, who is just 5ft2ins tall, is already reported to have slimmed down to just over six stone in her attempts to resemble a living anime character, and is said to spend 30 minutes painstakingly applying her dramatic make-up to each one of her eyes.

It is thought Shpagina may go even further in her efforts to achieve her desired look, with some reports claiming she intends to undergo surgery on her eyes to make her resemble her anime idols even more closely.

Shpagina is not the first young girl to take style inspiration from the world of fantasy. American Dakota Rose - or Kota Koti - has been dubbed the 'real-life Barbie' thanks to her doe-eyed stare and dainty proportions.
