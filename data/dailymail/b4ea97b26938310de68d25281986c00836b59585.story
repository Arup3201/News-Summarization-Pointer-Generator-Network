It does come around quickly. There will have been under five weeks between Philipp Lahm lifting the World Cup in Brazil and Manchester United kicking off the new Premier League season. 

In a sense not a lot has changed since Manuel Pellegrini clawed back the title in May. City's attempts to retain their crown hinge on an ability to keep Chelsea, United, Liverpool and Arsenal at bay. Jose Mourinho will typify prickle, Arsene Wenger's counsel should remain intact.

Five men, however, are hoping that 2014/15 is the campaign when everything alters for the better. There is a quintet who've starred this pre-season for their respective clubs and may be ready to spring a surprise after being firmly thrust the tag 'flop' previously.

Find the net: Stevan Jovetic has four goals in two pre-season games over in America for Man City

Yes, notching during meaningless friendlies against varying opposition isn't a definitive barometer as to how individuals will perform come the first week of the season, but Sportsmail takes a look at a few who may fancy themselves on August 16. 

Stevan Jovetic (Manchester City) 

'I have said before that Stevan is a very important player for us, and he proved again what an asset he can be,' Pellegrini said after Jovetic scored twice against Liverpool over in America this week. And the Chilean is right - here is a striker with real pedigree. 

It's the reason why City spent £22million on the front man this time last year and why, despite his chronic injury problems, they are willing to stick by him. 

While Jovetic will be the first to admit he doesn't score enough goals - although it's four in two games for him in the International Champions Cup - there is a certain flicker of added life he brings on the edge of the box. 

Pellegrini ended that press conference post-Liverpool by saying: 'If he's fit all the year, he will be a very important player for us.' If a line summed up a player's situation, it was that.

Ashley Young (Manchester United) 

Young is a very interesting case indeed. At 29, the argument most prevalent is that this is a winger to have wasted his talent and coasted after Sir Alex Ferguson paid Aston Villa more than £15million for him in 2011. 

But there is a sense that Louis van Gaal has sent a rocket in Young's direction, with the England international indicating against Real Madrid that he has more intent from wide areas and isn't afraid to take his man on inside or out. 

Crucially Young has been smiling in America. It's not often over the last two years you've been able to say that. A happy winger is one who will frighten full-backs. 

Point to prove: Ashley Young scored twice against Real Madrid for Manchester United this week

No worries: New United boss Louis van Gaal is the sort of manager who is able to get the best out of Young

Yaya Sanogo (Arsenal)

It was difficult not to feel sorry for poor old Sanogo during his first term in English football. Plucked from Auxerre after scoring 10 goals in Ligue 2 - that's two, not the top division - he immediately became a figure of fun with a gangly style and apparent lack of goalscoring inclination. 

But this is a man who is only 21, and one with next to no knowledge of competing in a premier division at that. 

The four goals against Benfica over the weekend, therefore, will do him the world of good. The Frenchman clearly knows where the net is. They were the finishes of a striker who may have a say for Arsenal off the bench if nothing else this year. No more Sanogoal?

Not a bad start! Sanogo scored four times against a hapless Benfica in a friendly on Saturday afternoon

Roberto Soldado (Tottenham) 

A healthy portion of Andre Villas-Boas' Gareth Bale-induced bumper transfer kitty of 2013 was spent on a striker who seemingly could only take penalties. So it seemed, and that isn't an unfair conclusion to draw from a first year littered with missed chances, head-dropping and sulky frowns.

But one thing has always remained constant with Spurs fans: they are willing to back Soldado. And why on earth not? This is the same front man to lead Valencia's line for three goal-laden years and who commanded £26million. That, the La Liga side felt, was his market value at the time. 

It is with some encouragement then that he is back among the scorers during this pre-season with two against Celtic - albeit a young side after the seniors had been given a thorough hiding by Legia Warsaw in the Champions League. He is laying on for others and puts in more work that given credit for. Mauricio Pochettino may just get the best from him yet. 

A new man? Roberto Soldado has looked more threatening for Tottenham under Mauricio Pochettino

Lead: David Nugent is hoping for Leicester goals 

David Nugent (Leicester City)

That goal. You know the one. Andorra away, circa 2007. Nugent, during his only cap for England, robbed Jermain Defoe a goal by pouncing on his effort - that was going over the line - to steal unwarranted glory. 

In fact, that split-second decision didn't fare particularly well for Nugent in the ensuing years. He was seen as a bit of a joke and poster boy for the ill-fated reign of Steve McClaren as national boss. 

But those assumptions are a touch unfair. 

Nugent is, and has always been, a very competent striker at the top end of the Championship with the potential to ruffle Premier League feathers. 

Now under Nigel Pearson at Leicester he should spearhead their attack (even with the overpriced Leonardo Ulloa having signed from Brighton). 

While the Andorran goalhanging is what he may forever be remembered for, a deft outside of the boot beauty against Crewe - which went viral on the internet - is more in tune with what the ex-Portsmouth striker is capable of. 

Remember this? Nugent scored a ridiculous solitary goal for England away in Andorra seven years ago
