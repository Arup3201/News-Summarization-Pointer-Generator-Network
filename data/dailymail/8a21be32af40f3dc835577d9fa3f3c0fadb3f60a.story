Mario Balotelli was the wrong signing for Liverpool because he doesn't fit the club's style of play, says Michael Owen.

Balotelli has struggled on Merseyside since his £16million move from Italian giants AC Milan - scoring just twice in 12 appearances and none in the Premier League.

The 24-year-old is struggling to fill the gap left by Luis Suarez, and former Anfield favourite Owen believes Brendan Rodgers' philosophy is unnatural to Balotelli's game.

Luis Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers last season

'Balotelli is clearly a talented player, but he is not in the bracket of world-class strikers Liverpool need if they are to get near the levels of last season. 

'You might argue that there are not too many around who are, but the biggest surprise for me when Liverpool signed Balotelli is that he was so clearly unsuited to Rodgers' preferred system,' he wrote in his column for the Daily Telegraph. 

'When you favour a high-intensity, quick-pressing game you have to have your scouts hunting for players who will fit seamlessly into your formation, closing down defenders and covering all areas of the pitch. 

'You know the you are never going to get another Suarez - that is impossible - but it is important to have someone who at least endeavours to make the same runs and works just as hard.

'Otherwise, as we seem to be seeing on a weekly basis at Anfield, the manager is is being forced to change his formation, compromising what worked so perfectly last season. 

'It is strange that the new manager has such a clearly defined way of playing and yet some of his players recruited over the summer do not necessarily fit into it.

'With Balotelli, Liverpool not only took a risk in terms of whether the player would deliver on the pitch - and not get into any trouble off it - but also gambled that he would actually be able to make the transition tactically from what he is used to.

'I am not so sure that leopards can change their spots.'
