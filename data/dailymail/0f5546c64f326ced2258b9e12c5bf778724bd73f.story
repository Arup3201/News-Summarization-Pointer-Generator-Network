Bookmakers have agreed to restrict the advertising of betting machines - dubbed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ - amid growing public unease about their impact.

Four major high street betting chains signed an open letter yesterday saying they understood the need to protect young and vulnerable people from the roulette-style games.

But anti-gambling campaigners slammed the initiative as ‘window dressing’ and called on the industry to slash the stake on the machines – on which customers can bet £100 a minute – to £2.

In a full-page advert in national newspapers, the firms – William Hill, Ladbrokes, Gala Coral and Paddy Power – acknowledged that concerns about the effects of gambling have ‘grown’. 

They said this is ‘particularly because of the tone of some of the advertising of betting on TV at times when children may be watching’.

From October 1, they promised to curb television adverts offering free bets and free money before the 9pm watershed.

There will be a total ban on advertising of Fixed Odds Betting machines (FOBTs) in betting shop windows, with a fifth of the space to be taken up with ‘responsible gambling messages’.

A new watchdog, the Senet Group, will be set up to police the rules and ‘name and shame’ those who do not comply.

Other major bookmakers such as Betfred, the fourth largest bookmaker, and Bet365 one of largest online betting sites, have been invited to sign up.

Carl Leaver, chief executive of Gala Coral, said it was a ‘very significant announcement.’ He said the Senet Group would be given the ‘independence, budget and purpose to hold the betting industry to account’.

Clive Efford, Labour’s sport spokesman, said the creation of a watchdog was a ‘welcome step’ but added that it had to cover ‘the whole industry’ and ‘must be completely independent of any influence from within the industry’.

Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said the industry was offering the ‘bare minimum’ in response to growing political pressure.

He said: ‘These measures look like a PR exercise rather than an attempt to help young and vulnerable people, because the central issue of the high stakes on FOBT machines isn’t being addressed.
