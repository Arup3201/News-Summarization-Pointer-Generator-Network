She may be Serbian by blood, but Roksanda Ilincic has been resolutely embraced as one of our own.

The London-based designer has risen swiftly and steeply through fashion's ranks since settling in the capital in 1999.

And her ascent has been assisted by some extremely important women, all of whom have been busy filling their wardrobes with her vibrant colours and statement dresses.

Simple elegance: The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out last night in her well-loved Roksanda Ilincic dress, without her husband Prince William

Royalty of the genuine, political and Hollywood variety have all demonstrated their fondness for Ilincic's idiosyncratic and ever-elegant creations.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Beatrice, Samantha Cameron, Michelle Obama and Tilda Swinton are just some of the sartorially clued-up women to appreciate her bold colour-blocking and clean, unfussy lines.

And the former Kate Middleton looks set to claim the title of Ilincic's staunchest fan, prepared to recycle the Central St Martin's graduate's elegant gowns on even the most prominent of public engagements.

The Duchess stepped out in an elegant, knee-length, dove grey Ilincic dress at last night's Creative Industries reception at the Royal Academy of Arts in London’s Piccadilly, where she met with David Cameron in support of the Government’s GREAT Campaign.

With her trademark blow-dried locks pinned back, Kate completed her outfit with a pair of grey suede heels, tan tights and hooped Kiki McDonough earrings.

Meeting the Prime Minister at the event - and without her husband, who was unavailable due to previous work commitments -  the Duchess clearly chose a dress in which she already knows she feels and looks confident.

After all, the understated grey cocktail dress - which features a pinched waist and slashed neckline - has been seen before.

Prince William's new wife sported the stunning gown in LA on her inaugural tour of America last year, just three months after their wedding.

The newly titled Duchess stepped off the plane at Los Angeles International Airport teaming the clean-cut day dress with tan heels and her hair let down.

But even though the dress did not make its orignial debut last night, the 35-year-old designer's pride at seeing it worn by the Duchess for a second time is still just as great.

Roksanda Ilincic tweeted her
 pleasure at seeing Kate wearing her gown last night, writing: 'Looking 
beautiful - so proud #duchess ofcambridge is wearing my dress tonight, 
xr'

All of a Twitter: The designer Roksanda Ilincic tweets excitedly about the Duchess of Cambridge wearing her pale grey dress

Ilincic - who has confessed to being 
fanatical about Yves Saint Laurent and having some 500 of the brand's 
vintage pieces - must be used to spotting celebrities wearing her 
creations by now.

The first ladies of both Britain and America - 
Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama - are big fans of her bold, 
Lego-like colours and clean lines.

Princess Beatrice stepped out wearing
 her delicious, long-sleeved peach frock - complete with appropriately 
royal blue sleeve tips - at a recent event.

And Hollywood royalty including Penelope Cruz, Emma Stone, Keira 
Knightley and Gwyneth Paltrow have all been photographed in her dresses, which cost from £300 to over £1,000.

Ilincic, who lives in north London with her husband  Philip Bueno de Mesquita and toddler daughter Efimia, designs four womenswear collections per year.

The former model - who yearned 
to be a ballet dancer when she was growing up, but felt 'too tall and 
awkward' - moved to London to study design after reading about Louise 
Wilson, a teacher at Central Saint Martins.

She
 thought to herself: 'If all those big-name designers are coming out of 
the same college, something amazing must be happening.'

The designer: Roksanda Ilincic, who was born in Serbia but has made London her home since 1999

She recently made her 
creations accessible to even more women (and also little girls), designing an
 affordable range for high-street department store Debenhams, and a 
unique designer line for children.

Her children's line, Blossom, is a selection of pretty dresses, stretchy tops and bold colours, made for two to eight-year-olds.

The designer plans to create two Blossom 
collections per year, with items on sale at Liberty and on 
AlexandAlexa.com, priced between £135 and £270.

Ilincic's almost-two-year-old daughter modelled the babywear for Blossom's debut line.

Back on the high street, Ilincic's Debenhams line features similarly bold colours and simple lines at a more affordable price, examples of which include a £95 beige satin maxi dress and a purple and orange colour block crepe dress, originally priced £75, now down to £22.50

The designer's Debenhams line also features a special edition children's T-shirt created for BBC Children In Need.

IIlincic joined a selection of other designers and celebrities - including Henry Holland, Julien Macdonald, Matthew Williamson, Jasper Conran, John Rocha, Sadie Frost, Jemima French, and Ben de Lisi - who all designed tees for little ones.

The unique tops are priced at £7, with all proceeds going to charity.
