It may be hard to believe, but the quality of air over major U.S. cities has improved over the past decade, new satellite images show.

Data collected by probes orbiting the earth for almost a decade has shown that the concentration of a damaging pollutant above cities including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles has dropped by as much as 42 per cent.

Information from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) shows that, between 2005 and 2011, there is significantly less nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere.

Changes: As shown above, Nasa data indicates that levels of pollutant nitrogen dioxide have dropped significantly across the U.S. between 2005 and 2011 

Nitrogen dioxide is a yellow-brown gas produced by burning petrol, and is regulated by the U.S. government. It has been linked to a host of respiratory problems, and can make those who breathe it in more vulnerable to diseases like flu.

The levels above major cities have fallen, despite both the human population and number of cars on the roads steadily increasing. 

According to scientists, the welcome change comes because of better technology, economic changes and tougher state regulation.

Windy city: Chicago, pictured above, has experienced the most significant change, with 43 per cent less of the pollutant between the more red picture, in 2005, and the less red one from 2011. Pull the slider to see the difference

East coast: Philadelphia, pictured above, saw a 26 per cent decrease from the redder image in 2005 to the bluer one in 2011. Pull the slider to see the difference 

Information shown in the images, which colour areas of high-quality air in blue and low-quality air in red, indicates that some cities have had their share of nitrogen dioxide drop by more than 40 per cent. 

Chicago has 43 per cent less of the pollutant in their air than in 2005, Los Angeles 40 per cent less and Atlanta, Georgia, experience a 42 per cent drop.

New York's figure decreased by 32 per cent, Philadelphia's by 26 and Houston, Texas, had a 24 per cent drop.

The measurements were taken in the summer months and averaged out over several years. 

However, the U.S. Envrionmental Protection Agency says the levels of pollution are still too high. According to its estimates 142million people, almost half the US population, live in areas with unhealthy air.

Bryan Duncan, a Nasa atmospheric scientists based in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: 'While our air quality has certainly improved over the last few decades, there is still work to do – ozone and particulate matter are still problems.'

Nasa says the new information will supplement existing data, which is usually taken from the ground rather than space.  

'You can't control what you don't measure,' said Russ Dickerson of the University of Maryland, College Park, and member of the NASA Air Quality Applied Sciences Team – created in 2011 by the NASA Applied Sciences Program to serve the needs of U.S. air quality management through the use of Earth Science satellite data, suborbital, and models.

'NASA measurements of air quality have value to the people with the authority to control emissions and develop policy.'
