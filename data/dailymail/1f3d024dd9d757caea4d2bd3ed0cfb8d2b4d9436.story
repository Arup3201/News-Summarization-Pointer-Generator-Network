Three Afghan military officers have vanished from a Massachusetts Air Force Base after failing to return from a trip to the mall, officials have said.

The soldiers, Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar, were reported missing from military training at Joint Base Cape Cod on Saturday.

The three men were last seen at a nearby mall and were not considered a threat to the public, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lieutenant Colonel James Sahady said.

They had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries.Â

'They were sent here to participate in this exercise,' Sahady said, adding that they did not have access to weapons as part of the training. 'There's no reason we have to believe that they are any threat.'

Base authorities, state, and police were involved in the
search for the missing soldiers on Sunday, Sahady said.

The annual event has been
running since 2004. Roughly 200 soldiers from six nations,
including 15 from Afghanistan, were participating in this year's
exercise, Sahady said.

The week-long exercise is scheduled to end on Wednesday.

CBS News reported on Friday that two Afghan policemen were
found after going missing from a separate training exercise held
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Quantico,
Virginia.
