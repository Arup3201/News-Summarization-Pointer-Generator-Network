A new road has been unveiled in the Netherlands that could change the way we drive in future.

This isn’t just a regular road – it’s a proof of concept for Studio Roosegaarde’s innovative ‘Smart Highway’ design.

Using glow-in-the-dark paint, it could lead to interactive and sustainable roads without streetlights.

Blurred lines: Dutch company Studio Roosegaarde unveiled its glow-in-the-dark technology two weeks ago (pictured) that could be used to light up roads in the future and create interactive 'Smart Highways,'  - but have admitted that the lines fade in the rain

The technology was first unveiled in 2012, when it scooped ‘Best Future Concept’ at the Dutch Design Awards.

Now it’s been deployed on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) section of the N329 road near Oss, Netherlands.

And, if it proves successful, their ‘Smart Highway’ could soon be making its way to a road near you.

With many energy-conscious governments switching off streetlights, this technology could be a green solution to lighting our roads.

Special lines are painted along the sides of roads.

These lines contain a ‘photo-luminising’ powder that charges in the day.

At night, the powder releases a green glow.

After absorbing daylight the paint can glow for up to ten hours, all through the hours of darkness.

The lines are bright enough that future roads could use them in place of streetlights.

It absorbs sunlight in the day and releases it at night, providing drivers with clear markings on where to go.

The company says the paint is a sustainable alternative to modern roads.

This particular test is a pilot project for the technology.

Ultimately, they say the same paint could be used to make interactive roads.

For example, weather symbols could be painted on the road that appear when the temperature reaches a certain level.

And Roosegaarde Studio, in collaboration with Heijmans Infrastructure, also has plans for other functionality including priority lanes that indicate when and where cars should change lanes. 

The technology has now been rolled out on a section of the N329 road near Oss in the Netherlands, but the company hopes it could be deployed internationally soon if the pilot proves successful

The stretch of road near Oss is not glowing as brightly as was hoped as it has been found that moisture affects the glow-in-the-dark paint, pictured here glowing at optimum levels

The technology is currently being tested on a 0.3-mile (500 metres) stretch of the N329 near Oss

Despite teething problems, it is hoped that the powder technology within the paint could be used to make road markings that change according to the temperature, giving drivers live weather reports that could warn them of icy roads

Studio Roosegaarde's plans for interactive roads also include lanes where electric cars could be charged

The designer behind the project, Daan Roosegaarde, is notorious for his somewhat wacky designs including the dress that turns transparent when it detects you're aroused, as recently reported by MailOnline.

‘Instead of focusing on the car to innovate the driving experience, Daan Roosegaarde and Heijmans are innovating the highway,’ the companies say in a release.

‘Innovative designs such as the Glow-in-the-Dark Road, Dynamic Paint, Interactive Light, Induction Priority Lane and Wind Light will be realized within the following five years.

‘The goal is to make roads that are more sustainable and interactive by using interactive lights, smart energy and road signs that adapt to specific traffic situations.’

While the paint is designed to a small section of road in the Netherlands for now, the companies hope to roll it out internationally.

Dynamic lines could be used to tell you when you can overtake and when you should stay in lane

Studio Roosegaarde also has plans for interactive lights that only turn on when they detect cars
