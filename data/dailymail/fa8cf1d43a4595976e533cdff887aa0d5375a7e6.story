TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh has seen off competition from Rihanna and Beyonce to be voted the best bikini body of 2013.

Almost one third of women polled said reality TV star Mecklenburgh had the beach figure they would most like to emulate.

In second place came Bajan beauty Rihanna, who cornered nearly a fifth of the vote thanks to her toned but curvaceous shape.

Rounding off the top 10 were singers Rita Ora with two per cent and Jessie J with one per cent of vote. 

One respondent said: 'I admire Lucy Mecklenburgh so much - she is such an inspiration with an amazing figure.

'I’ve
watched TOWIE from the start and she has always been slim but the fact 
that she has taken it on herself to tone up further when she doesn’t 
need to is great.

'She has inspired so many women of all ages to exercise and her bikini body shows that hard work really does pay off.'

Another woman who took part in the survey said: 'I think that Khloe Kardashian has a gorgeous figure and the best thing about it is that she’s earned it.

'She constantly has negative stories printed about her in the media for being overweight but now she’s proved everybody wrong and she looks fantastic.'

A spokesman for HolidayPlace.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'All of the women in the top 10 are beautiful and absolutely deserve to be there.

'Most of them put in so much hard work and effort to maintain a good figure so it’s so nice for them to receive that recognition.

'A lot of young women are being inspired to keep fit and healthy in the right way rather than extreme diets which is a great thing.'
