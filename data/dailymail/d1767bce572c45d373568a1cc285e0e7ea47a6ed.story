NSW Waratahs coach Michael Cheika has confirmed that he has been asked to coach the Wallabies, just two days after Ewen McKenzie's shock resignation.

On Monday, Cheika told media that he was 'humbled' and 'excited' by Australian Rugby's offer, speaking outside of the Waratah's Moore Park HQ.

'It's a pretty humbling experience to be asked to be involved in something like that, but we'll see what happens,' Cheika told reporters, according to Fox Sports.

'There are a few things to be ironed out, obviously the logistics et cetera ... Everything is so close. So we will see how it goes and work it out from there.'

NSW Waratahs Super Rugby title-winning coach Michael Cheika confirmed that he has been asked to take on the role of Wallabies coach while speaking to media on Monday

The position fell vacant after McKenzie announced his resignation following Saturday's loss to New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.

However the Australian Rugby Union is yet to confirm any appointment.

The Wallabies are due to leave for their spring tour of the northern hemisphere at the end of this week and a squad is likely to be named on Tuesday.

Cheika's coaching track record includes winning the Heineken Cup with Irish side Leinster and the Waratahs' maiden Super title earlier this year.

This comes after Ewen McKenzie's shock resignation following Saturday night's last minute, one-point loss to the New Zealand All Blacks

McKenzie stepped down as coach at 10am on Saturday morning following a tumultuous few weeks in the position, but did not notify anyone until after the game that night.

Recently the Wallabies have been wrapped up in a scandal including star player Kurtley Beale's row with team business manager Di Patston.

A letter sent to Beale by the Australian Rugby Union referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?', The Sunday Telegraph reported. 

It's been a few weeks of drama following the scandal involving Kurtley Beale and the offensive text messages he is said to have sent
