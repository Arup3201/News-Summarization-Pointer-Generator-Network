A 'safe play scheme’ that encourages parents to apply for their street to be closed off to traffic so their children can play safely, has been launched.

The Play Streets initiative will allow children to play on their car-free street for a few hours every fortnight without parents having to worry about traffic.

The scheme, introduced in Reading, applies to residential streets only and has been introduced as an opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other better and foster community spirit.

Safe game: Parents can apply to have their street closed for traffic for a few hours so children living in the neighbourhood can play safely together on the road

The scheme will go through a trial period of one year, Reading Borough Council said, and applicants need supporting signatures from around two-thirds of their neighbours to be considered for approval.

This means that a street can be closed for up to three hours every fortnight even if some of the residents object to the vehicle ban.

Tony Page, the council’s Lead Member for Strategic Environment, Planning and Transport, said there are some ‘clear benefits’ to the scheme for Reading.

‘Once established I am sure it will be something that is enjoyed by both young and older members of the community, much like the numerous street parties held across the borough were last year,' he said.

All together: It is hoped that by closing the streets from traffic for a few hours will foster community spirit and bring neighbours closer (file photo)

He added: ‘Some local authorities run schemes where they only close streets if there are no objections.

We are not planning to go that far but it is important that any application has as much support as possible from the residents who live on that street’

Although a Play Street can be created on any day of the week, Reading Borough Council has asked residents to avoid bin collection days.

Residents can apply for a Play Street day until July 12 with the first closure to be expected in early September.
