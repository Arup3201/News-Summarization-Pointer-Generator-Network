The end of the Bathurst 1000 matched the day's drama when road repairs to the track halted the race for an hour following a number of high-speed crashes.

Just two hours into the great Australian motor race, officials raised the red-flag just after 1pm as the new bitumen at turn two started breaking up heavily, causing a number of accidents at Mount Panorama in NSW on Sunday.

Nissan co-driver Taz Douglas went into the wall twice at high-speed corner, with the Fords of Paul Morris and Scott Pye also crashing at the same spot.

The area was filled and sealed with resin before the race resumed

The area was filled and sealed with resin before the race resumed an hour later.

In 53 editions of the endurance classic, never has it been restarted after a red-flag.

But the drama did not end there, with two more safety cars called in before the midway point of the 161-lap epic.

V8 Supercars championship leader Jamie Whincup took out the Nissan of Todd Kelly on the first lap after the restart, for which he copped a drive-through penalty.

The two cars were forced back into the pits for some quick repair work on the damage.

The annual race was halted about 1pm just hours after it started at 10.30am 

Whincup had produced the drive before the red flag, managing to climb from 23rd to fifth in just 15 laps and breaking his own race lap record.

Soon after his collision with Kelly, Steven Johnson hit a wall and spun his Ford at the top of the hill.

His retro-themed No.17 Falcon had to be towed back to the garage.

Five laps later, Pye also crashed heavily and wrote off his car - triggering the day's fifth safety car.

'Man, that escalated quickly,' Garth Tander, who was forced to sit out of the race after his wrecked Holden Racing Team Commodore was withdrawn after practice on Saturday, said.

In the 133rd lap of the race, Erebus' Lee Holdsworth overturned his car at turn two after clipping Repair Management Australia's Russell Ingall.

Ingall was able to drive away while minutes later Holdsworth was seen emerging out of his car.

Holden veteran Craig Lowndes had earlier predicted plenty of carnage in the endurance classic given what he had experienced on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

The grippy new track surface bit several cars in nearly every practice and qualifying session, including Lowndes.

The Bathurst 1000 eventually lasted for seven hours and 58 minutes.

This year's became the longest ever, with the previous record being set at seven hours and 50 minutes in 1974.

The day came to another dramatic end when Ford's Chaz Mostert and Paul Morris clenched a victory over Holden's Jamie Whincup who ran out of fuel just one kilometre from the finish line. 

Mostert, 22, who failed to finish on his Bathurst debut last year, and co-driver Morris started last on the grid - the lowest-ever position to win the race.

Morris, who started from the back after having been excluded from qualifying for passing a car under red flags, was among the victims of the accidents at turn two on Sunday after he crashed into the wall at high-speed.

'It was a bit scary but it kind of helped us a little bit - all the safety cars got us in position back up there,' Mostert said after the race, which saw a total of eight retirements and 10 safety car interventions.

'From 25th, I never even thought I'd get to the top 10 today. We got the 10 - just without the zero there.

'Who knew we'd go from 25th to first? Next year I might just not even qualify and just save our tyres for the race.' 

Despite a bright and clear start, a thunderstorm has been forecast for late Sunday afternoon
