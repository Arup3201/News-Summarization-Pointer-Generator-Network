Sydney's glamorous power couple Anthony Minichiello and Terry Biviano have bought a run-down Vaucluse property for more than $3 million.

This comes after they sold their neighbouring waterfront Bondi Beach penthouse, also in Sydney's eastern suburbs, for nearly $2 million in July.

The couple's personal buyer agents, Oliver Berger and David Cohen of Hastings Property, told Daily Mail Australia their newly purchased harbourside home  was built in the 1970s and is in its original condition.

Glamorous power couple Anthony Minichiello and Terry Biviano, pictured with their daughter Azura Tresor Minichiello, have bought a run-down Vaucluse property - in Sydney's eastern suburbs - for more than $3 million

The Vaucluse property was built in the mid-1970s and is in its original condition

The power couple are hoping to either renovate or knock down the property early next year

The four-bedroom home on Hopetoun Avenue sits on a large block of land which is ideal for entertaining

'They're extremely happy with it and signed the papers last night,' Mr Berger said.

'They're either planning to knock it down or completely gut it out and renovate it.'

Real estate agents, Mark Meyer and Diarnah Lynch of LJ Levi Real Estate, confirmed the property was sold for more than $3 million.

'One of the main attractions of the property was that it was built on 770sqm with a 20m frontage plus it's in a very nice part of Vaucluse,' Mr Meyer told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It's a renovator's delight and the buyers saw a lot of potential to build the home they really want.'

The four-bedroom home on Hopetoun Avenue sits on a large block of land, which Mr Berger agrees is perfect for 'a growing family'.

'That's 100 per cent and the couple love to entertain so that'll be great for them too,' he said.

'It's an amazing location, very private with its own gate and you can see the water from upstairs.'

Mr Berger says the former Sydney Roosters captain and his shoe designer wife, who have a one year-old daughter - Azura Tresor Minichiello, have been searching for their new home for about a year.

'They signed up with us about a month ago and we were able to get them this property before it even hit the market,' he said.

'All they wanted was to be on the harbourside of Vaucluse, nothing else, and that's the most expensive side.'

He also confirmed the couple sold their Bondi Beach penthouse for nearly $2 million.

And it appears no time has been wasted as Mr Berger says the happy owners have already started planning for their new home.

'They plan on renovating or knocking down the house next year and hopefully move in by late next year.'

The couple signed the papers last night are now happy owners of the Vaucluse property which sits on 770sqm of land
