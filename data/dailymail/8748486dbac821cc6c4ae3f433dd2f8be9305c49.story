This weekend will see the final ten contestants parade before millions of viewers in the glittering finale of Miss World 2013.

But the glitz and glamour of the iconic competition has been overshadowed by an ongoing outcry from Muslim extremists. Protestors have threatened to attack the pageant, which they have branded as 
'pornography' and a 'whore contest'.

The US embassy in Jakarta warned that: 'Extremist groups may be planning to 
disrupt the Miss World pageant…potentially through violent means,'

The growing movement has prompted the
 government to order the entire event be moved to Hindu-majority Bali, 
where extremist influence is minimal. 
Originally only the early rounds were due to take place on the island, 
with later rounds and the September 28 final to be held in and around 
the capital Jakarta.

But some hardliners are now claiming they will travel to Bali to protest.

Haidar Al-Hamid, head of the East Java province branch of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), told The Jakarta Globe: 'We are going to protest against it, because it is unacceptable.'

Al-Hamid said that the 
group planned to head to the island on Saturday, although they will face
 a tough time as main entry points will be heavily guarded.

However, Adjie S. Soeratmadjie, corporate secretary of TV network RCTI, which is
 broadcasting Miss World and helping to organise the pageant, told the 
paper: 'We are confident that the police will do everything necessary to
 ensure safety.'

In a 
nod to conservative public opinion, organisers have decided that the 
contestants will not wear bikinis during the 'beach fashion' round of 
the event.

Instead, they will cover up with garments such as sarongs, which avoid revealing the body shape.

Despite the axing of the bikini round, protests are rife and almost
 500 police, including traditional Balinese security personnel known as
 pecalang, have been deployed to guard Miss World venues as a result.

The final will
 last several hours and contestants will don Indonesian-designed dresses
 as well as being faced with a question and answer round 
from a panel of judges before a winner is crowned.

Julia Morley, chair of the Miss World Organisation, told AAP that the decision to ban the swimsuit section was taken in order to show 'respect' for the hosts and other participating countries.

'I don't want to upset or get anyone in a situation where we are being disrespectful,' she said.

The decision comes after a series of controversies surrounding Western singers performing in Indonesia.

Last year Lady Gaga cancelled a concert in the country when radical Islamists threatened to burn down the venue where she was performing in protest at her outlandish outfits.
