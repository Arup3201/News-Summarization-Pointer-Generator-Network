Police have arrested and charged Daniel Brady, 38, the father of missing teenagers Jayden Brady, 14, and Joseph, 11.

But NSW police said in a statement that officers still hold 'serious concerns' for the missing adolescents, who were last believed to be with their father in Tweed Heads more than a week ago.

Mr Brady will face Tweed Heads Local Court today, charged with breaching his bail conditions.

He was spotted by police while walking along Broken Head Road in Suffolk Park on the New South Wales north coast.

He was taken to Byron Bay police station where he was charged.

Daniel Brady, the father of the two missing boys, after he was charged this week. Police allege Mr Brady has refused to help them find Jayden and Joseph.

Allegations: Police said the boys were last seen with their father in Tweed Heads around 3am on Sunday.

The search for the missing boys was focused on Tallow Beach near Byron Bay last Wednesday afternoon but the children were not found.

Acting Superintendent Shane Cribb told local newspaper the Tweed Daily News at the time that police believed Jayden and Joseph had been staying at a campsite there.

'We're confident that the boys have been camping there, although we're not sure about the father,' Supt Cribb was quoted saying.

The brothers were last seen at a family home in Tweed Heads, on the north coast of New South Wales, around 3am last Sunday morning.

Mr Brady was arrested in Byron Bay on last Monday and later charged for allegedly breaching a court order

He was held by police before being granted bail by Lismore Local Court late Tuesday afternoon.

Acting Superintendent Shane Cribb has told reporters that while the boys' disappearance was of 'serious' concern, it wasn't the first time the pair had gone missing.

He said previous incidents where the boys had gone missing with their dad had been 'a lot longer' than the current period.

Jayden is described as being of Caucasian appearance, between 120cm to 140cm tall, with thin build, brown hair and eyes.
