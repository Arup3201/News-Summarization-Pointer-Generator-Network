It is one of the more precarious ways to feel on top of the world.

But these hardy travellers are happy to laugh off the impending danger of a 2,000ft plunge into a rushing river below them.

At some points on their dangerous journey, believed to be between Killar and Kishtwar in the Himalayas of northern India, barely inches separate the men from a terrifying fall.

Tempting fate: One of the British passengers leans out of the van to catch a glimpse of the drop below him

Precarious: At some points the van is just inches from a 2,000ft drop

The footage shows the British travellers tentatively guide their their van along a track carved out of the rock high above the waters of the Chenab river below.

One passenger, identified only as Rob, remains tight-lipped throughout the experience despite being prompted to chime in by the narrator.

At one point a man referred to as Rinku, who appears to be a local, steps out of the van in order to survey an overhanging rockface, which the tourists fear may be so low as to stop the vehicle from proceeding.

The video, uploaded to sharing site Prochan, invites watch to join the gut-churning spectacle as the camera is pointed over the lip over the road.

At any especially narrow spot, the men can't help tempting fate s they stare into the abyss below with cries of 'Oh my God!' and 'What do you reckon to that drop?'

Slippery territory: At one point the road passes directly under a waterfall

They do not seem to have complete confidence in their vehicle either, with one man wondering whether the doors might give way and leave him plunging down the mountainside.

The stretch, dubbed 'the narrowest we've been through' by the passengers, was also described as 'the maddest road I've ever been down in my life'.

Nonetheless, everybody seemed impressed by the break taking views, despite the danger that came with them.

One particularly dangerous moment came when the van came close to a waterfall, sheltered only by the lip overhanging their road.

Amusingly, the camerman failed to close his window in time and ended up with a soaked chair.
