Barack Obama vowed today to maintain the best-equipped military in history, despite dramatic defence cuts which top Pentagon leaders admit will increase the risks to the U.S.

'Our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority,' Mr Obama said in a rare appearance in the Pentagon briefing room.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and several top military brass lined up on the stage behind him, underscoring Pentagon support for cuts that Mr Panetta and others said they know will be criticised as too drastic.

The strategy will ditch traditional 'Cold War-era systems' and concentrate instead on unmanned drones and electronic cyberwarfare.

Both ways: U.S. President Obama vowed to strengthen military presence in the Asia-Pacific region despite fiscal constraints that expect to cut $662 billion from the country's defense budget next year

Mr Obama said the emerging strategy 
overhaul is designed to contend with hundreds of billions of dollars in 
budget cuts and refocus the United States' national security priorities 
after a decade dominated by the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and 
Iraq.

The strategy, devised through a 
comprehensive review by civilian and military leaders, centered on the 
military the country needs after the 'long wars of the last decade are 
over,' Mr Obama said.

The cuts may make it impossible for the U.S. to wage two full-scale wars at the same time, as they have done in recent years.

Mr Panetta said that smaller military 
budgets will mean some tradeoffs and that the U.S. will take on 'some 
level of additional but acceptable risk.'

But Mr Panetta said that at this point
in history, in a changing world, the Pentagon would have been forced to
make a strategy shift anyway.

He says the money crisis merely forced the government's hand.

More cuts: While the U.S. is said to take on some additional risk due to its planned defense budget cuts, an additional $500 billion in cuts may be required in January of 2013

The president announced that the 
military will be reshaped over time with an emphasis on countering 
terrorism, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, protecting the U.S. 
homeland, and 'deterring and defeating aggression by any potential 
adversary.'

Those are not new military missions, and Mr Obama announced no new capabilities or defence initiatives.

He described a U.S. force that will 
retain much of its recent focus, with the exception of fighting a 
large-scale, prolonged conflict like the newly ended Iraq mission or the
ongoing war in Afghanistan.

'As we end today's wars and reshape 
our armed forces, we will ensure that our military is agile, flexible 
and ready for the full range of contingencies,' the president wrote in a
preamble to the new strategy, entitled, 'Sustaining U.S. Global 
Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.'

The strategy hints at a reduced U.S. 
military presence in Europe, notwithstanding a continuing close 
relationship with NATO, and says Asia will be a bigger priority.

It also emphasises improving U.S. capabilities in the areas of cyberwarfare and missile defence.

Mr Obama said: 'We’ll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces.

'We’ll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities we need for the future.'

Inevitable: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the change to the defense budget and handling was inevitable and that the money crisis merely forced the government's hand

Mr Obama's decision to announce the 
strategy himself underscores the political dimension of Washington's 
debate over defence cuts.

The administration says smaller 
Pentagon budgets are a must but will not come at the cost of sapping the
strength of a military in transition, even as it gets smaller.

In a presidential election year, the strategy gives Mr Obama a rhetorical tool to defend his Pentagon budget-cutting choices.

Republican contenders for the White 
House already have criticised him on a wide range of national security 
issues, including missile defence, Iran and planned reductions in ground
forces.

Mr Obama also wants the new strategy 
to represent a pivotal point in his stewardship of defence policy, which
has been burdened throughout his presidency by the wars he inherited 
and the drag these conflicts have placed on military resources.

Difference: Next year's defense budget is planned to be $43 billion less than congress gave the Pentagon last year

The new strategy moves the U.S. 
further from its longstanding goal of being able to successfully fight 
two major regional wars — like the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraqi forces 
from Kuwait or a theoretical ground war in Korea — at the same time.

The document released Thursday made 
clear that while some current missions of the military will be 
curtailed, none will be scrapped entirely.

'Wholesale divestment of the 
capability to conduct any mission would be unwise, based on historical 
and projected uses of U.S. military forces and our inability to predict 
the future,' the document said.

The administration and Congress 
already are slashing projected defence spending to reflect the closeout 
of the Iraq war and the drawdown in Afghanistan.

The $662billion defence 
budget planned for next year is $27billion less than Mr Obama wanted 
and $43 billion less than Congress gave the Pentagon this year.

The Pentagon announced no specifics on
the size of expected troop reductions; the Army and Marine Corps 
already are set to shrink beginning in 2015.

The document said the Pentagon will 
have to find savings in pay and health care benefits for members of the 
military, but it offered no specifics.

Mr Panetta in recent months had 
previewed the main themes of the strategy by emphasizing a need to 
continue pressuring al-Qaida and paying more attention to Asian security
challenges, including China and North Korea.

Factors guiding the Mr Obama administration's approach to reducing the defense budget are not limited to war-fighting strategy.

They also include judgments about how to contain the growing cost of military pay and health and retirement benefits.

The administration is expected to form
a commission to study the issue of retirement benefits, possibly led by
a prominent retired military officer.

The administration is in the final 
stages of deciding specific cuts in the 2013 budget, which Mr Obama will
submit to Congress next month.

The strategy to be announced by Mr 
Panetta and U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, is meant to accommodate about $489billion in defense cuts 
over the coming 10 years, as called for in a budget deal with Congress 
last summer.

An additional $500billion in cuts may be required starting in January 2013.

A prominent theme of the Pentagon's 
new strategy is what Mr Panetta has called a renewed commitment to 
security in the Asia-Pacific region.

The administration is not anticipating
military conflict in Asia, but Mr Panetta believes the U.S. got so 
bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 that it missed chances to
improve its strategic position in other regions.

China is a particular worry because of its economic dynamism and rapid defense buildup.

A more immediate concern is Iran, not 
only for its threats to disrupt the flow of international oil but also 
for its nuclear ambitions.
