Just weeks before Downton Abbey's controversial rape scene, producer Gareth Neame said the show's global popularity was due to its tame nature

The producer of Downton Abbey said the show's tameness was the reason behind its global success - just weeks before it aired a shocking rape scene.

More than 200 complaints flooded in to ITV following the controversial scene on Sunday, prompting the show's Oscar-winning writer Julian Fellowes to defend it.

ITV warned viewers about upsetting scenes before the start of the period drama but still received 'around 60 complaints' by Monday, with Ofcom also receiving an undisclosed number.

Just weeks earlier producer Global Globe-winning producer Gareth Neame said the show's global popularity was due to its tame nature.

According to the Daily Mirror he told a U.S. interviewer: 'Nobody [else] is doing it anywhere.

'No executives think that anyone wants it. The idea of the non-sexual love affair was so out of fashion it was on another planet.'

Viewers complained following the episode, aired on Sunday night, in which Joanna Froggatt's character, Anna Bates, was attacked by Mr Green, played by EastEnders actor Nigel Harman.

Mr Fellowes has defended the scene, saying the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic.

He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people.

'If we'd have wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out.

'The point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage.'

Joanne Froggatt has also defended the storyline, saying she is 'proud' of Downton Abbey for tackling the controversial subject.

The star said it was a 'brave' move by programme-makers to feature such a difficult scene in the normally genteel Sunday night series.

Froggatt, who was made aware of the storyline by Mr Neame a week before she was given the script, said creators of the show did not want to show graphic violence on screen.

Nigel Harman, who plays Mr Green in the show, also defended the storyline.

He said on This Morning on Monday: 'For a show like Downton Abbey it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea.'

The episode was seen by an average audience of 9.2 million according to overnight figures.
