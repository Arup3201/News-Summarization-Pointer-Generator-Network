Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Mikel Arteta will take over the Arsenal club captaincy following the decision to sell Thomas Vermaelen.

The Gunners boss, who saw his side beat Manchester City convincingly at Wembley in the Community Shield final, needed a new skipper after allowing Vermaelen to leave for Barcelona, and has opted for the experienced Spanish midfielder to fill the role.

Arteta's future has been unclear for much of the summer but with this latest news it looks increasingly likely the 32-year-old will remain at the club this season. Per Mertesacker has been named the new vice-captain at the club as a result.

Moving on: Former Gunners skipper Thomas Vermaelen has moved to Barcelona for £15m

Arsenal agreed to let Vermaelen go to Barcelona for £15million after Manchester United refused a swap deal involving Chris Smalling.

Arsenal were determined to push Vermaelen abroad unless United relented on Smalling, a player Wenger initially tried to sign from Fulham in 2010.

Barcelona director Raul Sanllehi travelled to London for talks this week and returned confident that Arsenal and Vermaelen would agree their terms on a four-year contract worth £80,000 a week.

The Belgium defender has now completed a £15m move to the Catalan giants.
