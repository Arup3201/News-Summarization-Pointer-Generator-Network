Sir John Sawers called for Britain’s overseas intelligence service to be more agile in response to the threats posed by the uprisings in the Middle East

The head of MI6 yesterday launched a thinly-disguised attack on the West’s inadequate response to the Arab Spring.

In a rare public intervention, Sir John Sawers called for Britain’s overseas intelligence service to be more agile in response to the threats posed by the uprisings in the Middle East.

‘If you decide not to [rebuild], as we did in Libya, partly because of the scars from Iraq, then you topple the government and you end up having nothing in its place,’ he said. ‘And if you don’t intervene at all, you end up with a situation like you have in Syria. These are real dilemmas.’

Sir John, British ambassador in Cairo between 2001 and 2003, said the Arab Spring – a series of populist uprisings in North African dictatorships between 2010 and 2012 – demonstrated that revolutionary change is impossible to manage. It will normally end up worse for Western interests and values, he added.

‘We saw it in Tehran in 1979, and we’ve seen it in Egypt over the past few years,’ he said in an interview with the Financial Times.

His comments will embarrass David Cameron and Nick Clegg, both of whom have been accused of over-the-top reactions to the uprisings. In 2011, Mr Clegg infamously described events in Egypt as ‘incredibly exciting’.

Hundreds had already been killed or beaten when the Deputy Prime Minister told ITV: ‘It is incredibly exciting what is going on, it reminds me so much of the time when the Berlin Wall fell, the power of the people out on the streets, in a regime which two weeks ago everybody thought was one of the most stable regimes in the region.’

Mr Cameron visited both Cairo’s Tahrir Square and the Libyan capital Tripoli in 2011.

He also addressed the United Nations on the exciting implications of the Arab Spring, saying: ‘Where there was fear, now there is hope and an optimism and belief that is truly inspiring.’

But in recent months, the Foreign Office has had to coordinate the rescue of hundreds of Britons stranded in Tripoli which is still mired in turmoil. 

Libya has since lurched ever closer to fragmentation and civil war after Islamist-led militias seized the airport in Tripoli and proclaimed their own government.

Sir John, whose job title is traditionally known as ‘C’, retires in November after five years in post during which he has not been afraid to speak out about his security concerns.

In 2010 he suggested the war on terror was too focused on Afghanistan even as the US and UK were pursuing a military surge against the Taliban.

He told the Financial Times yesterday: ‘Terrorists were bobbing up elsewhere in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia and so on, and they weren’t getting anything like the attention that the terrorist threat from Afghanistan was.’

On secondment to Baghdad in 2003, shortly after the US-led invasion, Sir John told London that Iraq was descending into chaos.

Last November, he appeared before the Intelligence and Security Committee of MPs and peers and was asked why the security services had failed to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and the Arab Spring.

He said that was not their job, telling the committee: ‘We acquire the secrets that other countries don’t want us to know... we are not all-knowing specialists in what’s going to happen next month or next year.’
