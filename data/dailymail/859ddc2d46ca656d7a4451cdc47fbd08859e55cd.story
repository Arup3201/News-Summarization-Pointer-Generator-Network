A war hero who sailed the lead landing craft ashore at Sword Beach on D-Day then got it back home again despite a direct hit from a shell has died aged 95.

Edmund 'Tommy' Purser was praised in a senior officer's report for his actions on D-Day after sailing back to base despite a shell blast killing several of his crew and leaving his craft almost unseaworthy.

The following year he also helped to land troops on the Channel Islands in an operation which ended their occupation by the Nazis on May 9.

Edmund 'Tommy' Purser, a veteran of the Second World War who took the lead landing craft on to Sword Beach on D-Day has died aged 95 (pictured left with wife Pam, and right in 1942)

Mr Purser joined the Royal Navy in 1940 and spent his early years aboard HMS Vanquisher, helping to defend shipping convoys in the North Atlantic as they made their way from Iceland to the Azores.

After becoming a Commissioned Officer in 1942, Mr Purser was transferred to New York where he spent Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year while waiting for his ship to be built.

He spent much of the next year in Gibraltar and the Mediterranean helping to guard precious supply convoys from German U-boats, before returning to England in October 1943. 

There he was transferred to the Landing Craft Infantry and began training for Operation Overlord, part of which was the D-Day landings.

Following the invasion of Normandy, Mr Purser's craft was repaired and he sailed several more missions to France, bringing vital supplies and reinforcements ashore.

He also took part in liberating of the Channel Islands from the Nazis, again landing troops on the beaches.

Some time between the two attacks he met and married his wife, Pam, who was serving in the Women's Royal Navy Service.

Mr Purser was mentioned in dispatches by a senior officer after managing to sail his boat back to base on D-Day despite suffering a direct shell hit (craft pictured in American livery after being transferred to the US)

After the war Mr Purser took up a career in accounting, living briefly in London, Exeter and Plymouth before he and his wife settled in Devon, where they had two sons, Simon and Stephen.

The couple then moved to Bridgehill Garth, before finally moving to Bronte Residential Home in Ebford for their final time together after 69 years of marriage.

Mr Purser continued sailing into his later years and held a membership at a sailing club in Topsham, near Exeter, where a flag is today being flown at half mast in his honour.

At his funeral Stephen Purser paid tribute to his father, saying he had enjoyed an active social life, loved to dance, and also enjoyed playing golf.

He is survived by his wife, now 91, his two sons, and two grandsons Paul and Mark.

Like his grandfather, Mark has seen active duty with the army in Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland.
