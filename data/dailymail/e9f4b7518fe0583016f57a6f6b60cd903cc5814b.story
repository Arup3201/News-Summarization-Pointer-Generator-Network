A suspected drunk-driver crashed into a crash scene where Bruce Jenner rear-ended a Lexus in a fatal four-vehicle pileup just hours before.

The second driver went through police barriers on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, and crashed into the wreckage from the earlier crash, police said.

He was handcuffed after getting out of his car at the scene, and arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.

Officials told local news station KTLA that the driver passed a patrol car with flashing red lights when he slammed into two wrecked cars, still there six hours after the collision involving Jenner.

The second collision took place around 6:30pm, while the first happened at midday.

An elderly woman was killed, and five children and two adults injured, after Jenner's Cadillac Escalade slammed into a white Lexus.

The car was pushed into oncoming traffic, which it was hit by a Hummer, killing the woman inside and leaving her vehicle a wreck.

After performing, and passing, a sobriety test, Jenner was seen being driven from the scene in a patrol car - reportedly to provide a blood test.
