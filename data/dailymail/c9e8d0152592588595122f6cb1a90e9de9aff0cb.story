Former Wales international Andy Powell began 2015 in life-changing fashion following the birth of his first child with his wife, Natasha.

The birth of son Henry on New Year's Day completed a remarkable 12-month turnaround for the couple, which saw Mrs Powell throw out her husband as well as selling his prized possessions on eBay after accusing him of cheating, gambling and lying.

However, the 33-year-old former Wales and British Lions player manage to reconcile with his wife after he promised to change his ways.

Last year Ms Gascoine left him and then tweeted  all of Powell's sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes.

But the couple have managed to make a fresh start and on Thursday the 26-year-old gave birth to their son Henry at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales. 

Mr Powell, who was dubbed a 'scrumbag' during their public split, on Friday tweeted today that it was the best day of his life.

A friend said: 'It has been a hell of a year for Andy and Natasha. But now they have a little one to think about - it is all new for them.' 

The happy news signifies an incredible turnaround for the couple who looked to be heading for divorce.

Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her.

His wife  even sold the suit her husband wore on their wedding day during their initial break-up

Mr Powell has played rugby at the highest level and fans had been able to buy his boots for less than £20 

She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested.

She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him. 

At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. 

'Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.' 

But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are happy.

Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family.

She said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time. 

'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track.

'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.'

The 6ft 4ins forward was capped 23 times for Wales and toured with the British Lions before turning to rugby league with Wigan. He then moved back to Wales to play for the Newport Gwent Dragons.

After the birth of their first child at around 9am on New Year's Day Powell had to rush off to take his place alongside the Newport Gwent Dragons as they lost to Cardiff Blues.

New mum Natasha was said to be 'recovering well'.
