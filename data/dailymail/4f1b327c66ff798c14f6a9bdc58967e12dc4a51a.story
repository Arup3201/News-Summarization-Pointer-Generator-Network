It's not unusual for dog owners to treat their loyal companions like children, but this man appears to have taken it to the extreme.

Zhu Tai, 43, has taught his poodle how to walk on its hind legs and even dresses it like a small girl.

Now the dog has taken the internet by storm after a video was posted online of the pair taking their daily walk in Chengdu southwest China's Sichuan Province.  

Creepy or cute? This poodle is the poodle that has been taught by its owner to walk on its hind legs and wear girls clothes

The dog's owner Zhu Tai, 43, said the poodle is male but he dresses him in skirts because they are more comfortable

A video of the dog has gone viral after it was uploaded onto the internet by fans in its home country of China

Mr Tai, 43 said: 'I know that he is wearing a hat and a skirt but actually he is a male poodle, one-year-old, but we opted for the girls clothing because a skirt is more comfortable for the dog. And I just think it looks funnier.

'It only took me two months to train him, and despite the occasional critic he really enjoys himself, he can go about two kilometres on his back legs without needing to come down on all fours.'

Mr Tai, who owns several dogs, trains then for a hobby.

He admits that the poodle is the most talented of all his pets. 

'He really likes doing tricks and dressing up, so he learns quickly,' he said.

The dog is a hit with locals and is now also hit with the online community, with the video being shared thousands of times after it was posted on Chinese social media website Weibo.

User Lu said: 'The dog is so cute and lovely. And it's so hard to believe that she (sic) can walk so well.'

The images of the poodle emerged as it has been revealed that 90 per cent of pet-owners in the US regard their animals as part of the family.

And $60 billion (£35 billion) was spent on companion animals in the US alone in 2013.
