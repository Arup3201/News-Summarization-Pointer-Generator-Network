A nurse who appeared in the iconic Victory over Japan Day kiss photo helped commemorate the anniversary of the joyous day by posing for a touching re-enactment on Wednesday.

Gloria Bullard, 87, stood in Times Square, just like she did as thousands celebrated the end of World War II that day in 1945, and let herself be swept off her feet.

The stage was set under a giant video projection of the famous photo, 67 years after V J Day became one of the greatest moments for the Greatest Generation.

The iconic photo of a nurse and a soldier in a the middle of a jubilant kiss as New Yorkers took to cheer on the Allied victory is actually two photos.

Perhaps the most well-known was taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and shows the couple kissing head on. It’s the version that appeared in TIME magazine’s end of the war issue.

The other shot, of the very same moment, was taken by Victor Jorgensen a shows the kissing couple from the side, with more of the Times Square crowd in the background.

Among the onlookers watching what would become one of history’s most famous kisses was nursing student Gloria Bullard, then known as Gloria Delaney. She’s taking a peek at the smoochers, as seen at the photos far back at left.

‘We decided to walk over to Eighth Avenue to take the bus home,’ Mrs. Bullard said in a New York Times interview she gave in 2010. ‘That’s when we got caught in Times Square.’

Bullard was let out of class at New York Medical College, then at 105th Street, to join in the festivities—all while still wearing their starched, white uniforms.

‘That was a no-no, but who cares that day,’ Mrs. Bullard said. ‘We didn’t want to lose any time at all.’

Bullard, then doing her part to fill-in for nurses who were enlisted in the war effort, has now pitched to help memorialize the Greatest Generation’s most momentous day.

Memorial: To commemorate the historic moment and the day it has come to represent, a jumbo screen of the photo, comprised of smaller shots of couples from the day has been lit for 24 hours on the 67th anniversary VJ Day

Under a sign that was erected in Times Square for the 67th anniversary, Bullard was held in the steady arms of World War II fighter pilot Jerry Yellin on Wednesday.

Above them, innumerable photos of couples who met during the war years are projected in such a way as to come together and form the legendary photograph.

Both then and now, Bullard is all smiles and she still remembers the day fondly.

‘It was so exciting,’ Mrs. Bullard said. ‘Horns, church bells, all kinds of noises.’

Unfortunately, the woman who claimed for years to be the nurse being kissed in the photo, Edith Shain, died in 2010.

So Bullard’s account is the best that remains. But she says Shain was enjoying herself, too.

‘It looked to me like she was trying to keep her skirt down. I got the impression she was enjoying it.’

Greatest generation: Bullard remembers the moment fondly and says the nurse being kissed, long claimed to be the late Edith Shain, enjoyed it too. 'I got the impression she was enjoying it,' Bullard says
