John Bercow today added to the list of government ministers who will not be sending him a Christmas card when he launched a prolonged attack on Anna Soubry's 'totally unacceptable' behaviour in the Commons.

Ms Soubry, appointed a health minister in the reshuffle, became the latest figure to be slapped down by the Commons Speaker, as tensions between the government and Mr Bercow reached a new  low.

Mr Bercow bellowed at Ms Soubry three times in just 90 minutes, branding her behaviour in the Commons as ‘totally unacceptable’.

Commons Speaker John Bercow told health minister Anna Soubry her views were not relevant

He also made clear it would not let matters rest there, saying he would be ‘speaking to others about the matter’.

Mr Bercow has repeatedly fallen out with Tory ministers, notably clashing with transport minister Simon Burns – who once called him a ‘stupid, sanctimonious dwarf' - and Cabinet minister Patrick McLoughlin during his time as chief whip.

A former Tory MP, Mr Bercow won the Speakership with the support of Labour MPs and has appeared to be at war with his former party ever since.

Ms Soubry was first rebuked during a 
raucous session of Prime Minister's Questions, with Nick Clegg standing 
in for the absent David Cameron.

Ms Soubry, an outspoken former TV presenter, was appointed a health minister in September's reshuffle

She was sitting on the backbenches, enthusiastically heckling Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman.

But Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘I know that the junior minister in the back row thinks that her views are relevant.

‘I'm not interested, I don't want heckling, what I want is for the question to be heard and it can be heard with courtesy.’

But the row flared up twice later during a health debate, when Ms Soubry was sitting on the Government's front bench.

Mr Bercow accused her of ‘conducting a running commentary’ during the debate and said: ‘I don't want to hear the sedentary chuntering and the finger wagging and all the rest of it.’

Ms Soubry, an outspoken former TV presenter, sought to argue.

But Mr Bercow was having none of it, telling her that ‘she can say pooh if she wants’ but she had to ‘accept the ruling of the chair and either behave or get out of the chamber’.

In the third clash, Mr Bercow made sure that the Government's duty whip was aware of his views about Ms Soubry, who was attempting to argue with Labour MP Kerry McCarthy from her seat on the front bench.

He told Ms Soubry: ‘Perhaps she'll have the courtesy to listen when she's being spoken to from the chair.

‘It is not acceptable for any member of this House to treat this as a private conversation between him or herself and the member on his or her feet.’

He went on: ‘It is totally unacceptable behaving this way and it will stop straight away.

‘I hope the whip has noticed it and I will be speaking to others about the matter.’
