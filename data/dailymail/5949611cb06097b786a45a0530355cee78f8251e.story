Newly appointed MBE and Rugby World Cup winner Sarah Hunter believes 2014 was the most significant year yet for closing the gender equality gap in sport.

Despite only two players from England women’s 2014 world champion side being recognised on the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List - compared to all of the winning men’s squad in 2003 - Hunter feels that the unprecedented success will prove a turning point for the profile of female competition.

‘I think 2014 might have been the year to push female sport into a different level,’ said Hunter. ‘All the accolades in women’s sport last year have been a massive turning point.

'Lizzy Yarnold at the Winter Olympics, Jo Pavey at the Commonwealth Games and Charlotte Dujardin becoming a world champion rider; the list goes on.’

Hunter, who linked up with the England squad on Saturday for their first camp ahead of the Six Nations, added: ‘We had 40,000 people turn out to watch England’s women play football at Wembley and I think that’s set the tone for just how great women’s sport is in the UK.

‘Now we need to keep up this momentum and level of coverage.’
