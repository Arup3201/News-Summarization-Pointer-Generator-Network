Leon Quarless was arrested after he had been handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers on a flight from Palma, Majorca, to Blackpool

A drunk man who handed out money to fellow passengers on a flight from Majorca has lost nearly £5,000 which he had on him at the time.

Police have claimed Leon Quarless, 46, who was arrested after his Jet2 flight from Palma, Majorca, touched down at its destination in Blackpool, Lancashire, had the money because he was involved in drug dealing.

During the flight the pilot had radioed ahead and reported how Quarless had been drinking and then went up and down the aisle handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers.

He was later fined in June last year £320 for being drunk on an aircraft.

Now, a court has ruled police can keep the rest of the money which was found on him - a total of £4,972.

Following his initial fine, Lancashire Police started a Proceeds of Crime Act into Quarless, from Formby, Merseyside, Blackpool Magistrates heard.

Police financial investigator Alan Todd told how when Quarless was questioned about his money giveaway he suddenly removed a SIM card from his phone and put it in his mouth and crunched it up with his teeth.

He was also found to be carrying a driving licence under the name Joseph Noone.

The investigator told the court: 'This man does not appear to have a job. The Inland Revenue has never heard of him and has no records on him whatsoever.

'He has however boarded 50 flights in two years out of the UK mostly to Spain and Holland.

'£70,000 in cash has gone through his various bank accounts during that time.

'Merseyside Police have intelligence that he may be involved in drugs and we believe this money has come about because of drug dealing.'

Prosecutor Sue McLane said : 'It is fair to say that if this money we wish to seize came about legally he would have been banging on our doors to ask for it back.'

Magistrates agreed to the seizure of the money found on Quarless which will now be going into a real charity fund run by the Chief Constable.
