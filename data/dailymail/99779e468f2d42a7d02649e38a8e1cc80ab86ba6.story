The Prabal Gurung dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge last week has sold out just an hour after it went on sale on a discount fashion site.

The purple-and-white printed shift, which originally cost $1,995, was chosen by Catherine to meet the President of the Republic of Singapore last Tuesday.

Just days later, the same dress was put up for sale at a 60per cent discount on MyHabit, a private sale site owned by Amazon that sells past season designer collections.

Royal bargain: The dress was discounted from its original $1,995 down to just $599

Representatives for MyHabit said that
 the dress, still pricey at $599, had been available in U.S. sizes 4 and 8, 
and the entire stock sold out in just under an hour.

They told the New York Daily News: 'The dress is quintessential Prabal - unique print and a gorgeous use of
 color interpreted in a classic silhouette with the utmost elegance.'

The Duchess of Cambridge gave the up-and-coming U.S. label global exposure by choosing the 
dresses for her nine-day tour of south east Asia and the South Pacific with Prince William.

Not only was it an elegant and fashion-forward choice, it also paid tribute to her Singaporean hosts, as the designer was born in the city, before spending his childhood in Nepal.

The dress was also a step away from 
the small band of British designers, including Alexander McQueen, 
Temperley London and Jenny Packham, that she usually favours for formal 
occasions.

Since launching his label in New York in
 2009, Mr Gurung has become the darling of the fashion scene there, and a favourite with the A-list.

The Duchess's dress is from the spring/summer 2012 collection, which was modelled by Victoria's Secret supermodel Candice Swanepoel in the label's campaign.

Prabal Gurung has become a hot ticket at New York Fashion Week, and 
his latest collection was no different, attended by Hailee Steinfeld, Rachel Zoe and Kate Bosworth.

Last week, the designer took to Twitter to express his delight.

'So xctd that I just stopped some strangers on the street n showed them the pic of Kate Middleton in our dress,' he wrote.

Mr Gurung's designs are a particular favourite with 
Michelle Obama, who won universal praise after wearing a one-shoulder 
chartreuse gown to the 2011 Governor's Dinner last March. 
She also wore one of his creations to the White House Correspondents' 
Dinner in May, and again at the Concert for Hope in September.

Mila Kunis was spotted in one of his dresses at a charity 
benefit, Rooney Mara was seen in a cutout design at the New York 
premiere of the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and Jessica Chastain wore a 
deep green gown to the Palm Springs Film Festival.

The Prabal Gurung dress was a second outfit for Catherine, who wore a kimono-inspired Jenny Packham number earlier in the day.

The couple visited the Botanic Gardens 
where they had a hybrid orchid named after them. They then spent a few 
minutes quietly viewing the Dendrobium Memoria Orchid named after 
Princess Diana.

The pair then returned to Raffles, 
where they stayed for their three nights in Singapore, then set off for the Istana, the President's official residence, to 
spend some time with Tony Tan and his wife Mary.
