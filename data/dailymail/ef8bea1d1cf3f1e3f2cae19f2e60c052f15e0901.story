Jack Wilshere has promised England will not crumble in the jungle after their intense acclimatisation training regime.

Roy Hodgson’s players will start to take their anti-malaria medication today ahead of the flight to Manaus in the Amazon rainforest on Thursday.

‘It doesn’t hold any fears,’ said Wilshere. ‘Maybe it did when we saw the draw but not we’ve prepared.

‘We trained hard in Portugal, we trained with the extra layers, we went to Miami and we stepped it up a little bit.

‘Now we are feeling really good. We’ve got things in place, including cooling systems in the dressing room which is going to help us.’

The ‘cooling systems’ are giant industrial fans which spray cold water, designed to help the players cool down at half-time and after their opening group stage match against Italy on Saturday night.

They will be transported to Manaus with the rest of the equipment, but Wilshere pointed out that most of the English players will have spent pre-season in hotter and more humid climates.

‘I’ve been to Malaysia before in pre-season and trained, and not been able to breath,’ he said. ‘There was just no air. It’s a different heat in Malaysia, and the humidity was over 90 per cent.

‘In Manaus it will be around 75. Here and in Miami, I do feel a little bit better.’

Wilshere, whose form for Arsenal varied considerably last season, is thought to be competing with Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson for a spot in England’s midfield alongside captain Steven Gerrard but he does not see it that way.

‘There is that (competition) throughout the squad but it would be disrespectful to Frank Lampard and Ross Barkley — Frank has played for England over 100 times — to say it was between me and Jordan,’ he said.

‘Jordan has had a great season, so has Frank, Ross, Alex...’
