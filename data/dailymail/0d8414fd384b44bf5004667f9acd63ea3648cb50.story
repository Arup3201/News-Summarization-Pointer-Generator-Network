A Missouri sixth-grader with Asperger's syndrome has suffered complications from a severe beating he took in the lunchroom from another student, his parents say.

Twelve-year-old Blake Kitchen, of Liberty, has a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear that may require surgery, his mother said.

'It makes me sad and angry to see him have that moment of terror,' Destiny Kitchen told WDAF-TV. 'Is your son going to make it? To listen to him cry and say, ''Mommy, I'm going to die. Please don't let me die. I'm not ready.'''

Has Asperger's: Blake Kitchen, 12, of Liberty, Missouri, has a cracked skull, a fractured jaw and damage to his ear that may require surgery after a severe beating he took at school from a classmate

The Liberty School District said in a written statement that the incident is being reviewed and school leaders are cooperating with police.

Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. 

His parents say that turned troublesome last Thursday, when a boy moved Blake's belongings from his seat. When Blake asked the boy to move, another boy began hitting him.

'Then I blacked out,' Blake told WDAF. 'My ear hurts, my jaw hurts, my back hurts and that's all.'

That boy, whose name has not been released, was arrested and has been referred to juvenile court, Liberty police Capt. Andy Hedrick told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Hedrick declined to elaborate about the case. 

Happened at school: Blake has Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and likes to sit at the same spot each day in the Liberty Middle School cafeteria. The altercation occurred after some other schoolchildren moved his stuff in the cafeteria one morning

Blake's parents said they sent a certified letter to the school's principal about a month ago complaining about the same boy bullying Blake's older brother.

'It could have been avoided,' Destiny Kitchen said.

Blake spent four days at Children's Mercy Hospital and was released Monday, Jessica Salazar, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Tuesday.

Calls Tuesday the school superintendent's office and Destiny Kitchen were not immediately returned to The Associated Press. 

Preventable? 'It makes me sad and angry to see him have that moment of terror,' mother Destiny Kitchen told WDAF-TV. She says she wrote a letter to the school warning them about the alleged attacker a month earlier
