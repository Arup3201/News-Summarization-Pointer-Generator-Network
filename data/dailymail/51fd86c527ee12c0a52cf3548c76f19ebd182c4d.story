Keeping your beloved pet happy and occupied can be demanding.

But photographer Sally Turner, 53, found a novel way of ensuring her ten-year-old border collie, Brac, didn’t get bored.

Using nothing more than a few simple commands and a bit of patience, she trained him to balance a stunning array of objects on his head.

From sausages and bacon to oranges and even three eggs on spoons, it seems there is nothing Brac can't balance on his head or hold in his mouth.

Stay: Sally Turner, 53, has trained her ten-year-old border collie Brac to hold a stunning array of objects - including a stack of sausages and bacon - on his nose

Patience: Mrs Turner began the training as a joke to keep her dog occupied, but he can now hold eggs and spoons in his mouth and keep glass of wine on his head

Good boy: Border collies are famously intelligent and pick up commands easily. Brac could already turn on the TV and close doors behind people before he began the balancing act

Mrs Turner, 53, who lives with husband Paul, 55, a management consultant, in Wilmington, Kent, trained Brac to stand perfectly still when she says the word 'steady'.

He will remain in that position until she says 'what a good dog', at which point he knows she is about to remove the object and reward him with a biscuit.

Bred for use as sheep dogs, border collies are very intelligent and are known for their ability to pick up commands extremely quickly.

They are also full of energy and become bored easily, and so need to be kept constantly occupied.

Stock still: Mrs Turner uses the command 'stay', meaning Brac will freeze until she says 'what a good dog', at which point he knows she is about to remove the objects and give him a treat

Say cheese: Mrs Turner, a photographer, lives with husband Paul, 55, a management consultant, in Wilmington, Kent, along with the endlessly obedient Brac 

Festive: Brac is also a hit at any Christmas party, after being trained to balance mince pies and a fully decorated miniature Christmas tree on his head

Mrs Turner had already trained him to turn on her television and close the door behind her, before beginning the balancing act.

She said: 'Border collies are working dogs and like to be kept busy. Brac always wants to be doing something and he likes to help us. 

'When he was six months old he could already recongnise the names of all his toys and since then he has learned so many commands I have lost count.

'We were just messing about when we started balancing things on him. He loves to please - plus he always gets a treat afterwards.

'Teaching him such tricks is just one way of keeping him busy, and it's a bit of fun. He enjoys being the centre of attention. Plus there's nothing worse than a bored border collie.' 

What a cracker: Mrs Turner said teaching Brac the balancing tricks are a god way to keep him busy, adding that 'there's nothing worse than a bored border collie'

Intelligent: Mrs Turner says Brac learned the names of his favourite toys when he was just a few months old and has learned so many commands since then 'I've lost count' 

Obedient: Mrs Turner said Brac loves performing his tricks because he wants to be the centre of attention
