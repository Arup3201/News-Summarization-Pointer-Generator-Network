Pupils at one of Britain’s top public schools were facing investigation last night after being heard hurling abuse at David Cameron during a social event in the grounds of Westminster Abbey.

Boys from £32,000-a-year Westminster School were heard shouting an obscene word at the Prime Minister as he gave a speech on tackling Islamic extremism in the grounds below their dormitory.

The incident occurred as Mr Cameron delivered a short speech to the centre-right Policy Exchange think tank in College Garden, behind Westminster Abbey. Westminster School, where Nick Clegg was once a pupil, dormitories back directly onto the walled garden.

Privileged: Pupils at the £32,0000-a-year Westminster School were heard shouting obsence words at the Prime Minister while he gave a speech below their dormitories

As the Prime Minister laid out the Government’s plans for tackling the threat posed by violent extremists a boy was heard shouting ‘a******’ at him from a dormitory window.

Shocked witnesses, who included ministers, MPs and policy advisers,  said the insult was repeated more than once.

One boy at the school was also heard shouting ‘Bedroom Tax b*****ds’ at Mr Cameron as he left the event on Wednesday evening.

The taunt is a reference to the Government’s Spare Room Subsidy, which requires council house tenants to pay a premium for having a spare bedroom if they do not wish to move to smaller accommodation.

It is unclear how many pupils were involved.

One eye-witness said: ‘There was a shout mid-speech and one as he was leaving. The Prime Minister carried on during his speech without missing a beat really. It came from a male student who was watching from a window of the school.’

But another witness thought at least two boys heckled the Prime Minister.

Westminster School is one of the most prestigious in the country and has a long connection with politics, having educated seven prime ministers over the centuries. Nick Clegg is a former pupil.

The schools head master Stephen Spurr last night voiced dismay at the incident and pledged to investigate.

Unfazed: Mr Cameron was said to have ignored the taunt and carried on his speech

He told the Daily Mail: ‘I will be investigating this matter. The pupils at this school are enormously interested in politics but they are also very courteous and like to listen.

‘They are willing to express their views but I will be very upset if they have been shouting out. I send my apologies to the Prime Minister and anyone else who was disconcerted.’

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg last night condemned the abuse, which he said would have dismayed the philosopher John Locke, a Westminster old boy.

Mr Rees-Mogg said: ‘People in a democracy are entitled to make their points of course, but it seems terribly bad manners to shout abuse at the Prime Minister. Then again, this is the school that produced Nick Clegg.’

Another Tory MP, who was present at the event, said: ‘It is pretty ironic that privileged kids at a £30,000-a-year school are shouting about the bedroom tax. I imagine their parents would be more worried about the idea of a window tax.’

A Downing Street source said that at least one shout was heard from the school during the Prime Minister’s speech, but insisted it was ‘not a matter of much consequence’.

The first interruption came as Mr Cameron, who was educated at rival school Eton, was making the case for taking on the Islamic extremism blamed for fostering terrorism.

‘There were those on the last government and before that who seemed to think it was ok to tolerate extremist language, extremist rhetoric, extremist mindsets as long as you never tolerated violent extremism.,’ he said.

‘It’s almost like saying it’s ok with the BNP, it’s only Combat 18 (a neo-Nazi organisation) you have to worry about.

‘We don’t accept fascists in this country so we shouldn’t accept that argument when it comes to Islamic extremism in our country.’
