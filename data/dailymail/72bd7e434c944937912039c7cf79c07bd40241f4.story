Trying to spot your friend in a crowded room can be tricky.

Your brain has to retrieve the memory of their face, and then hold it in place while scanning the crowd.

But the brain is able to make the task simpler by paying special attention to objects, according to a new study.

Researchers at MIT have identified a brain circuit that¿s key to shifting our focus from one object to another. Screen shots from a video of overlapping images of faces and houses, shown to subjects who were asked to pay attention to one or the other

Scientists in Massachusetts have found that a part of the brain, known as the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), controls visual processing areas for objects.

They hope their understanding of the process behind concentration could someday develop techniques that will help people with short attention spans focus more easily.

Currently, scientists know much less about object-based attention, such as recognising a face, than spatial attention, which involves focusing on what's happening in a particular location.

‘The interactions are surprisingly similar to those seen in spatial attention,’ said Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Robert Desimone. ‘It seems like it's a parallel process involving different areas.’

If you can’t resist the chance to put on a bet, blame your insula.

Scientists think that when this brain area is overactive, the heart rules our head and we can’t help but chase our losses.

The Cambridge University researchers said: ‘Future treatments for gambling addiction could seek to reduce this hyperactivity, either by drugs or psychological techniques.’

The researchers made the link after asking people with various brain injuries and healthy people play slot machine and roulette-style computer games.

A near miss on the slot machines made the players, except those with the damaged insulas, extra-keen to try their luck again.

Similarly, the scientists found that all of the players, apart from those with faulty insulas, made a common mistake when they played roulette.

MIT researchers used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to scan human subjects as they viewed a series of overlapping images of faces and houses.

Unlike functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is commonly used to measure brain activity, MEG can reveal the precise timing of neural activity, down to the millisecond.

The researchers presented the overlapping streams at two different rhythms — two images per second and 1.5 images per second — allowing them to identify brain regions responding to those images.

Each subject was told to pay attention to either faces or houses; because the houses and faces were in the same spot, the brain could not use spatial information to distinguish them.

The researchers found in both types of focus, the prefrontal cortex - the control centre for most brain functions - appears to take charge.

When the subjects were told to look for faces, activity in different regions of the brain became synchronised, suggesting that they were communicating with each other.

When the subjects paid attention to houses, the IFJ synchronised with a region known as the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which interprets information about places.

The researchers believe that the IFJ holds onto the idea of the object that the brain is looking for and directs the correct part of the brain to look for it.

MIT scientists are now studying how the brain shifts its focus between different types of sensory input, such as vision and hearing.

They are also investigating whether it might be possible to train people to better focus their attention by controlling the brain interactions involved in this process.
