A prison officer whose career was ended after an inmate plunged a broken bottle into her back has spoken of her relief that all guards are to be issued with stab vests.

Claire Lewis recalls how she ‘almost died’ when she was attacked by convicted triple murderer Kevan Thakrar three years ago.

But she says she could still be working in one of Britain’s top security jails if ministers had offered routine stab vests sooner.

A review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘covert clothing’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners, MailOnline revealed this week.

The number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade, with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights.

One morning in March 2013 Claire and fellow guard Craig Wylde unlocked Thakrar’s cell door at Frankland Prison, a Category A jail in County Durham.

Thakrar, serving three life sentences for murdering three men with a machine gun over a £10,000 drug debt, lunged at Craig with a broken chilli sauce bottle, tearing open his upper left arm and severing an artery.

‘Then he turned on me,’ Claire remembers. ‘He used a broken chilli sauce bottle. It snapped in my back and it almost killed me.

‘Had I had protective equipment I wouldn’t have suffered the injuries I suffered.  It left me with a hole about an inch deep and it chipped my spine.

‘As a result I subsequently was medically retired, I have got PTSD. I have lost my career,' she told MailOnline.

Claire, who lives with her partner Ged Mulheran and two daughters aged 18 and 15, said the attack had a ‘massive impact’ on the entire family, including ‘missing out’ on the years when her children were studying for exams.

‘Now I am on a cocktail of medication as well to assist with pain relief. I used to be physically fit and now I really struggle to do anything without suffering the consequences.’

The decision to issue prison guards with stab vests round the clock comes just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary.

Last year alone there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade, up from 127 in 2002.

Protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety.

But now prisons minister Jeremy Wright has revealed that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which runs the country’s jails is now ‘assessing the benefits and feasibility’ of issuing vests routinely.

Claire added: ‘It is very humbling to see that the government has finally made the right decision to issue staff with the right equipment.

‘I am over the moon to be honest because I don’t think members of the public actually realise what goes on inside those prison walls.

‘There is a need for protective equipment because the number of assaults is increasing.

‘We are dealing with some of the worst and most hardened criminals in the country. I think the prison service is kind of the forgotten service.

‘Once you are in those walls nobody knows exactly what you deal with on a daily basis.’

After the attack on Clair and Craig, Thakrar was cleared of attempted murder by a jury at Newcastle crown court. He claimed he had been a victim of a culture of racism at the jail and launched the attack in self defence after years of abuse.
