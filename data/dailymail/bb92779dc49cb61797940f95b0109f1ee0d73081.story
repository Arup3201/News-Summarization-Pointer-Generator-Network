Clutching a large sign declaring 'Thank You - She Lived', a police officer stood at the roadside expressing his gratitude to strangers who helped save his wife.

Leanne Jackson collapsed as she was walking the dog with her husband, police inspector Glenn in Australia.

As he struggled to keep her alive, a passer by phoned for an ambulance and other people helped perform CPR on her.

Thanks! Glenn Jackson stands at the roadside with his large sign after passers by helped save his wife after she collapsed in his arms

Mrs Jackson collapsed suddenly after suffering ventricular fibrillation - a severely abnormal heart rhythm.

Despite being declared clinically dead by ambulance officers who arrived at the scene in Scoresby, Melbourne, she pulled through and now Inspector Jackson wants to thank everyone who came to her aid.

With his sons Tom and Mitch, along with Tom's girlfriend Hayley, he stood at the spot where his wife had collapsed clutching the sign so that passing motorists and cyclists saw it.

'It was like the worst feeling in my life, times 100,' said Inspector Jackson as he recalled the moment when his wife collapsed.

With their dog's leash in one hand, he used his other hand to brace her fall as she started to drop.

A cyclist pulled over to help, held on to the dog and also called for an ambulance.

Then a couple stopped and helped with CPR, taking instructions from an emergency operator.

Ambulance official Patrick Donaldson told Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper that Mrs Jackson was clinically dead when paramedics arrived.

'We shocked her four times before her heart started beating again,' he said.

A few days later Mrs Jackson was taken out of an induced coma. Two weeks after the drama, she is now well enough to correspond with friends on Facebook.

'Without the help of those people who came to her aid, she wouldn't be here,' said Inspector Jackson.

Anxious to find those who helped, he has stood patiently at the roadside with the sign, hoping that the unknown Good Samaritans will stop so he can thank them personally.
