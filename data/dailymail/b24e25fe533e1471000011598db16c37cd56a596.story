Istanbul is preparing for more violent scenes after protesters were warned they would be removed from Taksim Square within 24 hours.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued the warning today following two weeks of violent confrontations.

It comes after the European Parliament issued a resolution condemning the excessive 
use of force by Turkish riot police against demonstrators.

Ratcheting up his defiant tone, Prime Minister Erdogan 
appears determined to end the protests that have put an 
unflattering international spotlight on his Islamic-rooted government 
and its handling of the biggest street unrest of his 10-year tenure.Â 

Erdogan's comments came a day after his Justice and Development party 
proposed a referendum over a development plan at Taksim Square that has 
fanned the protests.

Police have repeatedly fired water cannons, tear 
gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters; five people have died
and over 5,000 have been injured.

The government says 600 police were 
injured as well.

'This square belongs to the people of Istanbul, the people of the whole 
country, and to all international visitors. So we cannot allow 
troublemakers to hang around freely in this square,' Erdogan said.

Erdogan told local 
party leaders. 'We will clean the square.'

Erdogan also lashed out at the European Parliament over its non-binding 
motion for a resolution that expressed its concern over 'the 
disproportionate and excessive use of force' by Turkish police.

The EU assembly said it 'deplores the reactions of the Turkish 
Government and of Prime Minister Erdogan' - and accused him of adding to
the polarization of the situation.

Just minutes before the legislature approved the motion in a show of 
hands, Erdogan thundered to raucous applause: 'I won't recognize the 
decision that the European Union Parliament is going to take about us 
... Who do you think you are by taking such a decision?'

The protests erupted May 31 after a violent police crackdown on a 
peaceful sit-in by activists objecting to a development project that 
would cut down the trees in Gezi Park, adjacent to Taksim Square, with a
replica of Ottoman-era barracks.

The demonstrations then spread to dozens of cities, rallying tens of 
thousands of people each night, and broadened to a protest over 
Erdogan's overall rule.

Protesters who have camped out in a peaceful sit-in in Gezi Park 
remained on site yesterday.

Their continued presence by the hundreds has 
served as a base for large numbers of protesters who have congregated by
the thousands on Taksim Square - usually in the evening, after work.

Also yesterday, 26-year-old Ethem Sarisuluk - who had been on life 
support for days - was pronounced dead, according to family lawyer Sema 
Aksoy.

He was believed to have been hit in the head by a tear gas 
canister June 1 during protests in Ankara, though lawyers were going to 
sit in on the autopsy to verity the exact circumstances leading to his 
death.

Five people have died and more than 5,000 have been injured during the recent violence.
