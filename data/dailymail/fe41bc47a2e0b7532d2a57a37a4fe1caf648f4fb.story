Two judges were yesterday found guilty of misappropriating more than £1.5million of public money.Denis McKay and Stuart Turner systematically misused the legal aid money sent to their law firm, the Solicitors Regulation Authority said.

It ordered the two men to be struck off the roll of solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency has reported their behaviour to the City of London police.

However the pair continue to hold office as judges and, three years after their misuse of money was first detected, disciplinary proceedings are still going on and no criminal charges have been brought. The money, said to total more than £1.5million, is still missing.

Mr Turner, a junior partner in the Lancashire-based Lonsdales firm where the money went missing, said: ‘I would like to say sorry to the taxpayer.

‘I’ve been tried and found guilty, so I’ve got to pay the money back. But I didn’t know the full extent of the fraud. I regret ever going into partnership with Denis McKay – I’ve not spoken to him for four years.’

The misappropriation of legal aid money at Lonsdales is understood to date back to at least April 2000.

'We have a serious problem in this country with quality control when it comes to judges': Tory MP Douglas Carswell

The firm, which was founded by Mr McKay in 1980 with offices in Preston and Blackpool, held contracts to represent legally aided clients in civil claims, including major medical negligence cases.

When its clients succeeded in winning their cases, the firm claimed costs to cover its fees and expenses from losing opponents. 

It should then have returned the legal aid money to the legal aid authorities. This did not happen.

The Solicitors Regulation Authority said: ‘The pair deliberately, systematically and extensively failed to account to the Legal Services Commission, now the Legal Aid Agency, for at least £1.5million of public funds.’

Lonsdales was shut down by the regulator in June 2011, six months after the start of inquiries into its behaviour in December 2010.

It said Mr McKay had agreed that the firm owed a considerable sum and he hoped to repay it.

He is a deputy costs judge in London, where his role has been to adjudicate in disputes over the fees claimed by lawyers, including those involving legal aid.

Mr Turner, 54, is a district judge at Bury County Court and also acts as a costs judge – assessing whether lawyers’ fee claims are correct – at Blackpool County Court.

The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said both men had ‘voluntarily refrained’ from sitting as judges since SRA investigations against them began. It has started an inquiry but both are unlikely ever to take charge of a courtroom again.

The SRA has not published its full ruling against the two men and may not do so if they take up the option to appeal against yesterday’s decision.

Both have large houses near the upmarket seaside resort of Lytham St Annes in Lancashire.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘We have a serious problem in this country with quality control when it comes to judges.’
