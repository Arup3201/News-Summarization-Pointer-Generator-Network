A former professional rugby player said to have started the deadly NekNominate craze which has claimed three lives in Britain said 'it has gone too far'.

Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game where players film themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them.

The sportsman uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same.

He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'.

Within days of the post by the former 
London Irish and Barbarians player, the game was being regularly 
mentioned on Facebook and Twitter.

Others have said it is simply coincidence that Mr Samson posted a drinking video as the game suddenly took off.

He
 did not mention 'NekNominate' in his post - and other people around the
 world claim they were playing it throughout last year. The game was 
first mentioned on Twitter in 2011 and there were 198 mentions of it 
throughout 2013.

However, after Mr Samson's post on Facebook it was discussed on Twitter 1,048 times in the next two weeks.

Mr Samson, who now lives in Dubai, said that he had been playing NekNominate with his friends for more than a year.

The dangerous game has been blamed for the deaths of Bradley Eames, 20, Stephen Brooks, 27, and Isaac Richardson, 20.

But after being linked to the rapid spread of NekNominate, the rugby player has moved to dissociate himself from it.

Following the tragedies, scrum half Mr Samson told the Irish Sunday Mirror that he no longer wants to be associated with it at all.

'It has gone too far. This was not how it was supposed to go. The 
game started last year but I happened to do one at Christmas that got a 
lot of attention on my Facebook. It just snowballed,' he told Gemma Aldridge at the newspaper.

'In light of the deaths of people taking it too far, I would rather not be attached to it in any way, any more.'

Ross Samson was in his family home in Edinburgh when he posted his video at Christmas.

Hours later, he wrote that the game was being picked up around the world after his post.

'@NeckandNominate
 has gathered some momentum since last night! Videos coming from 
Edinburgh, London, Manchester, Yorkshire, France, Thailand!,' he wrote.

His friend Tom McArthur wrote on his blog last week that NekNominate was created in Scotland and not Australia.

He
 added that the game had got out of hand and was originally just 
'harmless fun' - before it exploded online and people experimented with 
ever more dangerous stunts.

He
 wrote: 'One motivated and slightly drunk man in Edinburgh on Christmas 
Day sparked the latest bout of "the most outrageous drinking game yet" -
 but you probably think the whole thing started Down Under.'

In
 the post, he added: 'Drinking games are not a new thing, and it would 
be wrong to bash participants of this game because of a few accidents.

Drink challenge: Bradley Eames, 20, is thought to have become the third British NekNominate victim. He died after downing two pints of gin. The footage was posted online

First victims: Stephen Brooks, 29, (left) who 
died after downing a pint of vodka and Isaac Richardson, 20, (right) who
 was the first person to die in Britain after taking part in a 
NekNominate challenge

Latest victim: Bradley Eames, 20, who is thought to have become the third person to die as a result of taking part in a NekNominate challenge

'It is a shame that this game has been highlighted in the mainstream media by the sad deaths of two young men, and while I lament the idiots that continue to think the game is about oneupmanship.

'I still have faith in the original 
incarnation as a harmless bit of fun between mates. I will continue to 
look forward to my next nomination.'

Bradley
 Eames, 20, apparently became the third British victim of the deadly 
crazy after filming himself downing nearly two pints of gin.

The
 salesman, from Nottingham, was found dead in his home four days after 
filming the stunt. Police are understood to have watched the video as 
they investigate the tragedy.

Lawyer
 Julian Young said that anyone who NekNominated in future could could 
find themselves hauled before a court - even  if the dangerous stunt 
didn't end in tragedy.

Determined: He throws back the remaining alcohol to complete his dare

Thumbs up: Bradley attempts to show he is fine after the dare, but just hours later he would complain of feeling unwell

He said that if someone died and the person who urged them to do the dare could face a manslaughter charge.

Mr
 Young said: 'Any person would have to prove that the person who did the
 nomination knew with a degree of certainty what was likely to occur.

'At the beginning of this no-one knew what was going to happen.'

But he said that there is now a 'good argument' that people would have been able to predict a tragic outcome.

Mr
 Young said: 'If a person knew, because of all the publicity, and said, 
"I have been watching it on the news, I nominated my mate and thought he
 would be all right but knew there was a risk" you could have grounds 
for a prosecution. It might be manslaughter.

'There is a possibility, if someone knew what the outcome could be, that it could cause death, there could be a prosecution.'
