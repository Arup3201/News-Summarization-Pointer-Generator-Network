Johnny Weir has opened up about his divorce from his husband - claiming his husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money.

In an ugly twist, the 29-year-old former skater shared details of his two-year marriage with Victor Voronov, a non-practising attorney, in an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday.

While he was all smiles and professionalism during his stint as a commentator in Sochi, behind the scenes, he struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner, he said. He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi.

And in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir's ex released an image of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm.

Speaking out: Former figure skater Johnny Weir appeared on Access Hollywood to talk about his divorce from his husband, who he claimed was emotionally abusive and relied on him to make money

Attack: TMZ reported this picture shows the bite marks when Johnny Weir attacked his partner Victor Voronov

'Sochi was one of the hardest times in 
my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own 
personal hell that I was living in.

'My husband was behaving very 
erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was 
on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.'

He said that while the damage 
couldn't be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov 
forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his 
mother.

He added that their
 fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, 
including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police.

A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.  Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court earlier this month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case.

Speaking to Access Hollywood, Weir said that physical attacks weren't just made by him.

'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said.

He
 added that he had added pressure because Voronov, whom he married after
 a short romance, had taken on the 'traditional' role and Weir was left 
to provide for the two of them.

'He was not super accepting of the 
fact that I work and I have to work this week in Russia, this week in 
Los Angeles, next week in Tokyo,' he said.

'I was supporting two people and whether it seems like a
 big deal or not, I come from a lower middle class family that has to 
work, no matter what.

'If you can’t be an attorney this 
week, then you better go get a job next week, otherwise the bills won’t 
get paid. I had to travel to work to support myself and to support my 
family.'

Split: Weir revealed that he had broken up from his husband on his Twitter account earlier this week

Shock: Voronov wrote on Twitter that he had only just learned that his husband had filed for divorce

On Friday, TMZ also reported that Weir emailed Voronov last September, claiming that he had destroyed his pricey Birkin bag.

'If you decide to wreck things, please wreck cheaper things than Birkin,' he wrote. 'He goes on ..."The f*** you on the Birkin is kinda cool, though, you artist.'

Despite
 the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter account that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement this week.

Weir had written on Wednesday: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.'

'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote on Wednesday.

On Thursday he added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.'

Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.'

But Weir said he's not worried about the scandal - and that his ex has nothing up his sleeve that could do any damage.

'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he said.

Weir officially came out as
 gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay 
suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate.

Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told 
IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in 
Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired 
to be in a relationship with'.

He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. He's
 wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my 
razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually 
do.'

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A
 marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage 
between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both 
constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's 
constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
