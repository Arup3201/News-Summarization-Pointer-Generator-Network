A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War has married the soldier who tried in vain to save his life.

Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban.

Liam Fisher, 22,  tried valiantly to save his comrade, and was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. 

Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan

But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. 

His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages. 

They soon realised they were falling for each other and the couple got engaged last November. 

The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was so moved by the story of the family that he granted a special licence for the couple to marry in York Minster in a moving ceremony held yesterday.

Leading the service yesterday, the Revd Canon Michael Smith, Pastor of the Minster, told the 40 guests:

'I know some of you have been to some really dark and painful places. Love is about being prepared to make sacrifices for the person or people we love.

'We remember those unable to come here today and are not here. We remember in God's presence Gregg and Jennie.

'We remember those lines that "Love never dies".

'We remember them and all our loved ones who have died as they share with is this day and our prayers.'

The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe.

Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court. 

Rosie-Ann said before the wedding: 'We are so happy. Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.

Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date

'When we got together, people were sceptical.

'People thought, "Is she just looking for comfort?" or "Is she just looking for a replacement brother?"

'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine.

'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different.

'He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.'

Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date in Bridlington the following August.

Pte Fisher at first did not even tell his new love about his Task Force Helmand commander's bravery commendation for trying to save her brother.

Describing Gregg's final moments, he said: 'It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything.

'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, 'It's 5m for me and you'. Then the rounds came flying.'

He added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.'

Rosie-Ann's parents said they were over the moon when the engagement was announced.

Her father Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel', while mother Angie added: 'We feel we have gained a son.'
