A man has been charged with assault in connection with an unprovoked attack on a 16-year-old girl near her home, police said tonight.

Michael Ayoade, 34, will appear before magistrates tomorrow, accused of carrying out the attack in Plaistow, east London, on Tuesday November 13, Scotland Yard said.

CCTV footage showed a man jogging up behind the 16-year-old and smacking her around the head. The girl, a student, was left lying on the ground as her attacker casually jogged off.

Scene: The victim, who collapsed to the pavement on this street in Plaistow, east London, said she had 'no idea' what was about to happen when she was attacked on the way to college

Ayoade, of Greengate Street, Plaistow, remains in custody and will appear at Thames Magistrates' Court, a police spokesman said.

The victim, who collapsed to the pavement after one powerful punch which was caught on CCTV, said she had 'no idea' what was about to happen when she was attacked on the way to college.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the teenager said that 'the next thing she knew’, she was waking up in an ambulance taking her to hospital. She was attacked outside the Black Lion pub in Plaistow.

CCTV footage was circulated by police in an effort to find the man responsible, with the girl's face blurred to protect her identity.

The teenager was taken to Newham General Hospital with bruising and cuts to her head and face, but was released the same day after tests.

Jacqui Hames, ex-police officer and Crimewatch presenter, told ITV's Daybreak: 'It was broad daylight, lunchtime, walking along seemingly minding her own business, and this happens.

'Thankfully this sort of thing is very rare, but if you change the location and the time to maybe near a pub or a club nearer midnight, that may be a different thing.’

The girl, who needed work on her teeth following the assault, is said to be 'bearing up well'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
