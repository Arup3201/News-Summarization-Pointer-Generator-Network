A New Hampshire volunteer firefighter 
who responded to the scene of a car accident Christmas Eve at first did 
not realize that the dying woman he had pulled out of the wreckage was
 his own daughter.

Steve Whitcomb, 58, was horrified to find his 30-year-old daughter Katie Hamilton, a mother of three, had died on the highway after a crash pushed her SUV into oncoming traffic and she was hit head-on, Brookline Police Chief Bill Quigley.

Whitcomb and Hamilton, his youngest daughter, worked together at his heating and plumbing business in the town of 5,000. In his spare time, the father also volunteers as a firefighter.

According to New Hampshire police, three cars were involved in the accident that took place just after 9am Tuesday.

Greg Cullen, 31, of Milford, New Hampshire first rear-ended Hamilton’s Ford Explorer SUV.

Hamilton had been either stopped or was slowing down to turn left, reports the Nashua Telegraph, when Cullen’s Toyota pickup smashed into her.

‘At
 the last minute - we don't know if it was driver distraction or what 
the cause was, we haven't been able to determine that,’ Brookline Police
 Chief Quigley said.

‘He
 swerved to avoid hitting her and still struck her on the very right 
rear corner of her vehicle, forcing her to come over to the northbound 
lane.’

That’s when James Ciprotti, 37, of Weare, New Hampshire, smashed into Hamilton head-on in his Ford F-250.

Cullen and Ciprotti were given medical evaluations, but neither was injured. Hamilton was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police Chief Quigley had said Whitcomb arived at the scene and pulled his daughter from the car ‘without knowing it was her.’

CBS
 Boston reported that Hamilton, a mother to three daughters, ages 2, 4 
and 9, was on her way to her parents' house just a mile away from her 
own home when the collision happened.

On Christmas Day, Katie Hamilton's grieving husband, Liam, woke up their three little girls.

'I tried to make it normal,' he told the Boston Globe.

However, the couple's youngest daughter, a 2-year-old, appeared confused and asked where their mommy was.

'Mommy died,' her 4-year-old sister replied.

Mr
 Hamilton took his girls to their grandparents, Steve Whitcomb and his 
wife, just like Katie Hamilton had done the day before - possibly saving
 her children's lives.

The
 30-year-old woman had dropped off the girls Tuesday morning at her 
parents' house on her way to work. She had planned to pick them up later
 to run some errands, but her mother convinced her to leave the kids 
with her.

Katie Hamilton never returned for her girls.

Liam
 Hamilton, who married Katie in 2008, said that his wife and her father 
were very close. The two had been working together in plumbing since 
Katie was a teenager.

The crash involved three cars. The other two drivers in the crash were not injured

‘You grieve and then you try to put it all back together,’ the heartbroken dad told the Nashua Telegraph.

Mr Whitcomb described his daughter as an outspoken person who never hesitated to say what was on her mind.

Fire Chief Charles Corey said Hamilton was a major supporter of the local fire department, often bringing food to fire scenes for the volunteers and organizing fundraisers.
