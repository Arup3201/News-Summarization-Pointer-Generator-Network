An attorney for Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts and her boyfriend (pictured in December)  has entered not guilty pleas on their behalf to misdemeanor lewd conduct charges.  Watts, 29, claimed that police accused her of being a prostitute when she was arrested in Los Angeles in September with Brian Lucas

Watts and Lucas found themselves at the center of a national controversy on September 11 when she claimed that the LAPD arrested her because she was a prostitute after her and Lucas were caught involved in an amorous clinch in broad daylight.

She claimed the police were heavy-handed and left her 'wrist bleeding in pain' and claimed the whole affair left her humiliated.

Lucas took to Facebook to specifically claim the LAPD arrested them because they assumed his girlfriend was a prostitute because they saw an interracial couple.

A recording of the arrest by one of the officers involved showed that Watts accused the police of racism when she refused to produce ID after a series of 911 calls from witnesses claiming a couple was having sex in their car.

'Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black? Just because I am black and he's white? I'm just being really honest,' she said to LAPD Sgt. Jim Parker.

In the recording Watts exclaims 'You are not the one who is in handcuffs'

'You're not the one who's spent your life being called a n----- and growing up in the south, and now I get the cops called on me.

An eyewitness in a nearby offfice building said Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth

'The cop pulled us over because he thought I was a prostitute.'

Parker later said in an interview with the MailOnline that he thought it was incorrect for Watts to accuse him and the other two officers of prejudice because he is gay and the other two police were a woman and a Latino.

Parker said he released the audio in an attempt so show that he was simply responding to a 911 calls that told the dispatcher Watts and Lucas were having sex with the door open and was reasonable during their encounter.

He also added that it was Watts' attitude and uncooperative nature that caused her to be arrested.

In the immediate aftermath, prominent civil rights leaders took up Watts' cause, but then asked her to apologize when the audio and pictures showing Watts sitting on top of Lucas inside his car were made public.

Sgt. Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he is speaking out because he's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he's been on the force

However, Watts and Lucas, who could face six months in jail have refused to apologize.

'I think there was a lot of personal risk involved for me to decide to even make that Facebook post,' Watts said, according to theNew York Daily News.

'I wouldn't have made that Facebook statement if I didn't believe this was an issue that deserves our national conversation and attention.

'And racial conflict is something that a lot of people don't want to talk about, because it's uncomfortable, but if I'm in a position where people are listening, I'm going to lend my voice to it.

'I believe conversations can help us move through these difficult things.'
