Can Liverpool's new boys fill the void left by Luis Suarez?

Liverpool are on the verge of completing a £30million double swoop for Belgium World Cup star Divock Origi and Benfica winger Lazar Markovic.

Origi was pictured arriving in Liverpool on Wednesday to discuss terms with Reds officials at their Melwood training ground and could undergo his medical alongside Markovic on Thursday.

A £19.8million fee for Markovic is believed to have been agreed with Benfica - which activated his release clause - while Origi looks sets to cost Liverpool £10m from French outfit Lille, although Tottenham are attempted to snatch the Belgian striker for themselves.

Wanted man: Tottenham are also interested in the striker and could look to scupper the deal

Target: Atletico Madrid have joined the race to sign Liverpool target, Belgium striker Divock Origi 

Done deal: Liverpool met the £20million release clause in Lazar Markovic's Benfica contract

Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to spend the £75m he will recuperate from the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and he is nearing adding Markovic to his squad.

The Anfield club have been in discussions with Benfica for weeks over a deal for their 20-year-old winger.

Markovic has played 12 times for Serbia, scoring twice, and he netted seven goals in 49 appearances for Benfica last season.

Origi meanwhile impressed at the World Cup, scoring for Belgium against Russia during the group stages after replacing Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku in the starting line-up.

The 19-year-old scored seven goals in 45 appearances for Lille last season.

Target: Markovic will undergo his medical at Anfield on Thursday ahead of his move

Prospect: 19-year-old Origi has already been scouted by several top Premier League clubs after a good season

Origi would not commit on where his future lay when asked in an event in his hometown of  Houthalen-Helchteren.

'I myself am still thinking about it,' he told reporters.

'It is true that there are offers from all over Europe. Now I have to look carefully where I will grow as a player and as a person.

'I think things will be clearer within two weeks at the most.'
