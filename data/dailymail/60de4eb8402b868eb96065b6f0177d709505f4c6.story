Shocked: Chad Doss has revealed his rare identical triplet daughters were conceived after his vasectomy reversal

A new father of rare identical triplet daughters has revealed they were conceived naturally after a vasectomy reversal.

Chad Doss, 31, from Franklin, Indiana, underwent the procedure in the hope of starting a family with his second wife, Amanda, in 2012 and was shocked with its efficiency.

'It’s beyond [a] miracle . . . It’s unbelievable,' he told Today.com following the birth of his daughters Avery, Cassidy and Bentley Doss on December 30. 

Mr Doss' urologist gave him about a 66per cent chance of being able to father a child within the first five years of getting his vasectomy reversed.

The surgery can take up to three to four hours and prices range from $5,000 to $20,000 depending on its complexity.

'We were thinking, we’ll try for one and grow our family just a little bit,' Mr Doss recalled.

His wife said she was overjoyed when she learned she was pregnant.

But when doctors confirmed there were three identical girls, '[that] was just the icing on the cake,' she exclaimed.

The Doss' newborns are currently at St. Vincent Women’s Hospital 
in Indianapolis, where they will remain in the neonatal intensive care 
unit for a few more weeks as they continue to grow.

Mr
 Doss - who has two children, aged nine and 12 from a previous marriage - said : 'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but 
then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle. We’re 
very blessed.'

'The best day ever': Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception in Mrs Doss' (pictured holding Bentley) womb

Dr. Charles Coddington, a reproductive endocrinologist and president of Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, said naturally occurring identical triplets are so rare there are no studies that establish how often it happens.

Various experts calculate the odds from one-in-one-million to 
one-in-100-million.

Doctors believe that the egg split into three soon after conception because the babies shared a placenta and chorionic sac but had their own amniotic sacs.

'It’s unbelievable that let alone we had a reversal, but then for us to have three and they’re identical, it’s a miracle'

Mrs Doss, 27, gave birth at 31 weeks just three months after a routine ultrasound revealed that she was carrying three babies.

She told the Indy Star: ‘It was just crazy to see three babies in three beds sitting here and doing well.

‘Seeing
 them for the first time was a very overwhelming experience, to feel 
them in my stomach for so long and just wonder what they will look like 
so to finally be able to see them was the best day ever.’

After
 more than a month’s bed rest, Mrs Doss was admitted to hospital in 
early December. 

There she felt contractions but progress was slow until 
her waters broke around midday on the 30th.

Instant family: Mrs and Mr Doss, who has two children from a previous marriage (pictured bottom with Mrs Doss), have had to trade in their two cars to buy a minivan to make way for their growing family

Within an hour she had given
 birth to three baby girls.

She said: ‘It was definitely just like in the blink of an eye that it happened.’

The Doss girls were named for their position in the womb though they were not delivered in ABC order.

The first to arrive was Avery, who weighed 3lbs 15oz; followed by Cassidy at 3lbs 11oz; and last came Bentley, the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz .

The Doss', who married in 2011, have traded in their two cars to purchase a minivan for their suddenly big family.

'I can’t wait to have [the girls] home and to be the mom and take care of my babies,' Mrs Doss concluded. 'I’m ready to take over.'
