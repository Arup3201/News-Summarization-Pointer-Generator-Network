The best match of this Wimbledon so far ended on Wednesday night with one of the protagonists on his knees, theatrically praying that a Hawkeye line call would save him.

Czech veteran Radek Stepanek had wowed the Centre Court with his antics and rocked Novak Djokovic with the consistent quality of his old school tennis,  briefly threatening to provide the first dramatic upset of the 2014 edition.

Yet just at the death, when it seemed we could be heading for a classic decider, the world number two reached inside himself to clinch a 6-4 6-3 6-7 7-6 victory with a rasping forehand that clipped the sideline.

The Centre Court rose as one to 
acclaim the combatants, and the relief at the replay screen will have 
been felt not just by Djokovic but also by his coach Boris Becker seated
 up in his player box.

Stepanek plays a wonderful brand of the sport, caressing the ball with 
soft hands and delighting the public with an animated demeanour that 
goes against the grain of stoic seriousness now so prevalent.

His histrionics clearly riled Djokovic at certain points, and 
contributed to a general unease which suggests that the Serb might be a 
little more vulnerable this year after yet another Grand Slam final 
setback at the French Open.

Andy Murray, who went through in such contrasting fashion, 
might have allowed himself to take note as he is due to have a repeat of
 last year’s final a week tomorrow in the last four.

The 35 year-old Czech, playing in his twelfth Championships, could so 
easily have pushed this one the full distance. Having come back from 2-5
 down in the second tiebreak to 5-5 thanks to some uncharacteristic 
wobbling from Djokovic he netted a straightforward volley that would 
have given him a set point.

While not entirely convincing the second seed is still not a man who 
needs a second invitation, and he finished it on his first chance, 
generously pointing to his opponent afterwards as they soaked up the 
acclaim.

It 
was not the only time the 27 year-old from Belgrade had shown the better
 side of his nature. In the eleventh game of the fourth set at deuce he 
had sportingly conceded a point by admitting that an incorrect call had 
not interfered with his shot that went out.

The whole effect was  a reminder that it need not be a Murray command performance to bring the old arena to its feet.

Afterwards Djokovic said: ‘I should not have complicated my life in this way, but credit to him, he’s an  entertainer and loves the big stage.’ The whole effect was a reminder that it need not be a Murray  command performance to bring the old arena to its feet.

So far the big upsets of last year have not come, and the likes of Djokovic will feel more sure of  themselves as the slick new grass courts become harder and browner as the fortnight progresses.

The Serb, who could have wrapped it up in straight sets, is relying 
here on Becker with his long-term mentor Marian Vajda sitting back at 
home, where he has pledged to spend more time. The reduced team will 
have plenty to debate before his next outing, against Frenchman Gilles 
Simon.

Worth the applause: Stepanek hit the deck on many occasions as he threw his all into the match
