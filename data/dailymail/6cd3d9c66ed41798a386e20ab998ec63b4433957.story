So where would you start? You have been thrust into the role of Liverpool manager and your first task is to fill the void created by Luis Suarez’s departure to Barcelona.

Sitting in the club bank account is £75million and you are free to go and spend it. With supporters clamouring for a new hero, you will assume you need to find a replacement with a similar standing to Suarez, someone who screams box office.

How about Karim Benzema, then? Fresh from a positive World Cup and winning the Champions League with Real Madrid, his class as a striker cannot be questioned.

Gone: Footballer of the Year Luis Suarez has left Liverpool for Barcelona in a £75million deal

He would cost in the region of £50m and demand huge wages but money isn’t an object for you, so why not?

If Benzema isn’t for you, what about Marco Reus from Borussia Dortmund? Yours for £45m. When he recovers from the ankle ligament damage that cost him a place in Germany’s World Cup winning-squad, there is no doubt he deserves a place in European football’s ‘A’ list.

Others would have to be considered. Why not Radamel Falcao, a striker who deserves to be playing in front of a bigger, more passionate crowd than Monaco's? Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint-Germain, maybe? Angel Di Maria, or even Mario Balotelli? 

Were Liverpool to land any of the aforementioned players, the news would be huge, the fee would be massive but, more than anything, the deal would represent a shift in a policy that goes back to the days of Bill Shankly.

Liverpool, in the main, do not raid big clubs to sign big names – they identify talent and turn them into stars.

Fitting the Bill: Shankly's way of developing talent is still practised at Liverpool

That has always been the preferred way. Kevin Keegan may have become a dual European Footballer of the Year later in his career but he arrived at Anfield in 1971 as an unheralded rookie from Scunthorpe, all fierce determination and boundless enthusiasm.

Playing in a fine team, having a desire to squeeze every last ounce of his ability and benefitting from the guidance of two uniquely gifted managers helped propel him to stardom. Keegan blossomed on Merseyside, he didn’t come as the ready-made package.

Similar sentiments apply to many others. Kenny Dalglish had been brilliant for Celtic but moving to Liverpool, where he crowned his first season with the goal that retained the European Cup, enabled him to scale completely new heights while dramatically enhancing his reputation.

You can go on reeling off examples: Ian Rush and John Barnes; Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard; Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano and Suarez – all had Liverpool to thank for providing the stage to bloom. None first wore a Red shirt at the peak of their powers.

It has never been Liverpool’s way to do, say, what Chelsea have done and buy Cesc Fabregas for in excess of £30m with huge wages from another European powerhouse and it certainly won’t be the way under Fenway Sports Group, as the ethos and economics don’t match.

So while the idea of going out and bidding for a name that would get plastered all over the back pages sounds romantic to supporters, there is little chance Rodgers, his transfer committee or FSG will consider doing just that.

Forward thinking: Manager Brendan Rodgers shares the philosophy of the clubs and its owners

Rodgers, for one, knows exactly what he is looking for in the players he signs. Last summer, when the window was closing, he was considering his options when the name of a Champions League winning player was put to him during a casual discussion.

He nodded his head about this player’s ability and pedigree but then asked the question: ‘would he now want to run through a wall for you every day?’

That is what Rodgers wants: youth, energy, hunger; players with desire to get to the top and keep improving on the way, players such as Lazar Markovic, Adam Lallana, Emre Can – a player whom Manchester United extensively scouted last season – and Divock Origi.

Of course there is respect for the big names, those who have been around and seen all there is to see, but Rodgers is a manager who, primarily, wants his squad filled with individuals who are careering towards their peak, not those who are established and already had that experience.

‘The idea is to have that squad in place by the end of August and it is going to be a really exciting time for us,’ Rodgers said recently. ‘We will improve. We’ve got a lot of young players who will have gained from the experience last season. I’m looking forward to seeing the development of the team.’

Which is why, then, he will take a measured approach to spending that Suarez bounty, rather than just heading for the names that only vast, vast sums could buy.
