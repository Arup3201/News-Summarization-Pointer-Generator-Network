Amir Beheshti, 40, has been trying to get refugee status for seven years, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts, who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country Iran

A failed asylum seeker who has dodged deportation from Britain for nearly a decade has been told he can stay – because he goes to the gym.

Amir Beheshti, 40, has been trying to get refugee status for seven years, but was repeatedly turned down by the courts, who ruled he would not suffer if he returned to his home country Iran.

But he has now told judges he has a private life that involves going for work-outs with his friends – which means his human rights would be violated if he was deported.

The controversial legal ruling by 
Scotland’s Court of Session means he will be allowed to continue living 
rent-free in his publicly funded flat and claiming a weekly allowance.

Earlier this month, a top Scottish 
judge issued a written decision in which he agreed the case should be 
referred back to Home Secretary Theresa May for fresh consideration.

This effectively means the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely.

Lord Glennie’s judgment read: ‘He had
 integrated well within the Glasgow community, had a large network of 
friends, most of whom were Scottish, and socialised with those friends 
at the gymnasium, at five-a-side football, in coffee shops, at college, 
in the library and at their homes.

‘He went on to say that he made use of local facilities, such as the library and Glasgow leisure centres'.

Beheshti’s claim, it said, was ‘based
 on Article 8 ECHR and, in particular, on the fact that he had, so he 
claimed, established a private life in the UK.

Beheshti was smuggled into Dover on a lorry in 2005.

In his asylum application he claimed 
his father’s pro-Jewish sympathies put him in danger in Iran – but it 
was rejected, as were two appeals.

Having travelled to Glasgow, where he
 lived with his sister for two years, he appealed to the Court of 
Session.

But in June 2009, Lord Osborne ruled he had consistently failed
 to provide any ‘credible’ evidence that he would personally face any 
persecution or disadvantage in Iran.

The decision marked the end of Beheshti’s rights of appeal.

Technically, he should then have been removed as an illegal immigrant, but no action to deport him was taken.

In February 2010, Beheshti wrote to 
UKBA, asking for ‘leave to remain’ based on Article 8 ECHR. When that 
was rejected, he launched another appeal to the Court of Session. This 
appeal was the one that led to him being allowed to stay.

Beheshti said recently that he ‘feels comfortable’ in Glasgow and does not have anybody left back in Iran.

Last night, his case - which has already cost the public purse tens of thousands of pounds - sparked outrage.

Emma Boon of the TaxPayers’ Alliance,
 said: ‘If the occasional trip to the gym is enough to allow a failed 
asylum seeker to appeal his deportation, then taxpayers will wonder who 
can’t claim a right to stay.

‘He
 should have been deported when his case was initially rejected. It’s 
appalling that we are left picking up all of his bills when he should 
have been sent home years ago'.

A UK Border Agency (UKBA) spokesman said: ‘Too often, Article 8 [of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing the right to a private and family life] has been used to place the family rights of illegal migrants above the rights of the British public in seeing our immigration laws properly enforced, and that balance needs to be redressed.

‘The Government will change the immigration rules to reinforce the public interest in seeing those who have breached our immigration laws removed from this country.

‘We have been seeking to remove this individual, but we have been asked by the courts to look again at this case.

‘Where we do not believe someone has the right to stay in this country, we expect them to return home'.

Partners: Bolivian immigrant Mr Soria (left) with British librarian Frank Trew

Camilo Renzo Soria found himself at the centre of the 'catgate' scandal earlier this month when Home Secretary Teresa May used the Bolivian as an example to illustrate how easy it is for illegal immigrants to not be deported.

The 36-year-old's cat, Maya, was the reason he was not kicked out, May, angling to ditch the controversial Human Rights Act, claimed.

But Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke clashed with May at the Tory Party Conference and stood 
up for Soria.

He angered the Conservatives by deriding her claim of the cat’s importance to the case as ‘laughable’ and ‘complete nonsense’ - and though he was correct he was roundly criticised.

Soria, a trained architect who had been in the country since 2002, stayed illegally in Britain for
 more than two years after his student visa expired.

His situation came to the 
attention of the authorities in 2007 when he was accused of shoplifting an ornamental cat.

But he fought off a Home Office move to deport him, arguing that his joint ownership of Maya with British librarian Frank Trew,  a 49-year-old Oxford graduate, showed the seriousness of their relationship.

'When we got Maya in 2005 we never thought it would lead to a national incident,' he said. 'But even after all that's happened I don't regret getting Maya.

'I have always worked. I have paid my tax and National Insurance and I have never claimed benefits.'

Soria has now enlisted the services of PR guru Neil Reading, who has often brokered lucrative deals between celebrities and newspapers in the past.

He and Mr Trew live together in a rented £220,000 flat and are intending to enter into a civil partnership in May or June next year.
