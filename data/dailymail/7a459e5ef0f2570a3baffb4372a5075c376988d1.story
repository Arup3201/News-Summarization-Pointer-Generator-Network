Super-sized bottles of cheap cider will be banned in a bid to tackle teenage drinking, under new Labour proposals set to be announced this week.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles.

Mr Burnham told MailOnline products like Frosty Jacks, White Ace and White Strike were fuelling under-age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles

The Labour frontbencher said the high-strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could 'cobble together' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week.

He said children as young as '11 or 12' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents' generation would not have been able to afford.

Many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit.

He said the cost and strength of cider made it 'very attractive to under-age drinkers, and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers'.

Mr Burnham told MailOnline: 'These cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength.

'We've worked it out at 20p a unit. We're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle.

'Young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them.

Mr Burnham said the proposal was 'the start of the road' for improving public health

'What we are trying to signal [is that] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people. They think why is everyone being punished – what's fair about that?'

He added that the proposal was 'the start of the road'.

But Mr Burnham all-but admitted he had gone boozing with his friends as a teenager.

The former health secretary said: 'I think we all grow up, don't we, and we learn as we go.

'I wasn't whiter than white in that respect. I did normal things that teenagers in the North West do.'

Mr Burnham pointed to a survey of white cider drinkers by Alcohol Concern which found 50 per cent saying they drank more than three litres a day, and 42 per cent saying they had been drinking it for more than ten years.

Mr Burnham is considering banning the sale of cider in bottles of more than one litre in size, or by taxing larger volume cider containers more heavily.

The party is also looking at proposals to create a new cheap cider tax to increase the cost of cheap booze.

A proposal to increase the minimum apple juice content that cider is required to contain will also be considered. This would increase the cost of producing white cider – forcing up the price in the supermarket.

Labour said the ballooning cost of treating alcohol related illnesses meant tackling problem drinking was essential.

The harmful use of alcohol costs the NHS in England around £3.5 billion a year and alcohol-related crime costs £11bn per year, the party said.

One in five children who drink now consume 15 or more units per week – twice an adult woman's weekly recommended limit.

Binge drinkers by 15 are four times more likely to be addicted in later life, and almost half of young people excluded from school in the UK are regular drinkers.
