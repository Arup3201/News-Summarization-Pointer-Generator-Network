On the outside it looks like a charming lakeside villa.

But the haunting truth is that this abandoned house in the woods was once owned by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels - and it is up for sale.

Adolf Hitler gave the Haus am Bogensee, the only Nazi residence which has not been demolished, as a gift to Goebbels during World War II.

The Haus am Bogensee, once owned by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, is up for sale

The 42-acre estate, nine miles north of Berlin, was converted into an East German Communist Party school after the end of World War II

Goebbels, pictured with Adolf Hitler, his wife Magda and his children, used the house as a place to write his virulent anti-Semitic speeches, as well as a place to indulge in several affairs with German actresses

Calling it a place of 'idyllic solitude', the main house, completed in 1939 and worth an estimated £12m, is where Goebbels retreated to write many of his vociferous anti-Semitic speeches.

The 70-room complex, nine miles north of Berlin's city limits, is also where he indulged in a string of affairs with German starlets who were brought in by Goebbels to replace Jewish actresses at the Babelsberg film studio where he produced his propaganda films.

This earned him the nickname 'Der Bock von Babelsberg' - the 'randy goat' - leading Hitler to put an end to his flings after Goebbels wife, Magda, threatened divorce.

Almost 70 years after Goebbels had his six children poisoned with cyanide before committing suicide alongside his wife in the garden of Hitler's Berlin bunker as Russian troops neared, his country estate has been put on the market.

The 42-acre property and grounds, owned by the city government, has been put up for sale twice since the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it was not sold.

Despite the history of the 'love nest', there have been bidders this time around.

The estate is home to a large fishing lake. Goebbels described the tranquil area as a place of 'idyllic solitude'

Marlies Masche of the Berlin Property Fund agency told the Independent on Sunday: 'We are not disclosing who they are or how much we are asking, because we don't want to upset prospective buyers.'

In previous sales the background of any interested parties had to be investigated for any links to neo-Nazi groups in case they intended to make the place a shrine to Goebbels. 

The listed building, which has its own large fishing lake, was used as a school for East Germany's Communist Party youth movement following the war.

Joseph Goebbels was one of the most important and influential people in Nazi Germany.

Hitler put him in charge of the party's propaganda machine in 1929 and he played a key role in implementing the dictator's agenda.

His limp and sharp tongue earned him the nickname among some as the 'Poison Dwarf'.

He organised attacks against Jews, banned them from the world of the arts and media, censored the news and supported Nazi propaganda films.

As WWII turned in favour of the Allies, he increased his propaganda in order to convince the German people of the idea of 'total war' and mobilisation.

Goebbels killed himself and his wife, and their six biological children with cyanide capsules the day after Hitler committed suicide in 1945.

The private villa used by Goebbels was converted into a kindergarten after the war ended but since 1990 it has been abandoned 

The site's carpenter in the 1960s, Werner Binder, 76, said the place was heavily guarded at the time, but added: 'But once inside it was like being in a holiday camp.'

Goebbels and his family lived in the house in the latter stages of the war, after Hitler had put an end to the propaganda minister's affairs, so they could be closer to him.

Goebbels felt the estate was a safe place for them as it was outside of the main city, and boasted an underground bunker - which partially remains.

The house also had a cinema and a fully intact banqueting hall.

The elaborate hall still has the oak-panelled ceiling, French windows and open fireplace that were installed before Goebbels moved in at the start of the war. 

The Berlin city government hope the estate will be turned into a hotel, spa or boarding school.

A spokeswoman said: 'We want total use of the site. The Goebbels villa is very difficult to separate from the rest.'
