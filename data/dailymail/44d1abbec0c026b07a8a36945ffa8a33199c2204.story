Wimbledon winner Andy Murray has blasted claims that he dislikes the English as 'nonsense' pointing out 'I am going to get married to one'.

The British tennis number one, who will tie the knot with English fiancee Kim Sears in April, said he finds the accusation upsetting as some of his family are English as well as his future in-laws.

'The whole notion that I don't like English people is nonsense,' he said.

'I work with English people on a daily basis. I am going to get married to one. I live here. It is just nonsense.'

'That's the thing that upsets me the most about it. Some of my family are English. I am also getting married to an Englishwoman so my in-laws are all English.'

He defended his late intervention into the Scottish independence debate to declare his support for a Yes vote on the eve of the referendum.

'I was lying awake at night. I wanted to say something,' said the Scot.

'The thing that irritates me the most is that somehow you can't be pro-independence and pro-British.

'My feeling is Scotland is its own country. Every country would work better if it was in control of its own destiny. 

'I said at the time was that the people of Scotland will make the right decision. Just because I think one way doesn't mean it's the right way for Scotland.'

His tweet saying that 'No campaign negativity totally swayed my view on this' provoked a backlash on the eve of the poll.

And after an onslaught of abuse online, the player said he was 'disappointed' by his decision to send the tweet and claimed it was not really in his character.

'I don't normally do stuff like that. So, yeah, I was a bit disappointed by that. It's time to move on. I can't go back on that and I'll concentrate on my tennis for the next few months,' he said at the time. 

Murray first received his anti-English tag in 2006 as a 19-year-old when he jokingly said he  hoped 'anyone but England' would win the World Cup.

But the champion tennis player insisted his commitment to playing for Great Britain was beyond doubt, saying he 'loved' representing his country.

He won the British public round when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the Wimbledon title in 2013

'When I compete for GB, I absolutely love it,' said Murray. 'My results when I have competed for GB since I was 12 would suggest that.

'When I represented Britain in the Olympics, I played maybe the best tournament of my life. I love competing for my country. I don't think any differently about Great Britain after what has happened.'

He inspired a generation and won the British public round when he beat Novak Djokovic to win the Wimbledon title in 2013.

The historic win ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion.

He has won 19 Davis Cup singles rubbers and lost only two and on Friday he will anchor the British side again in their anticipated World Group first-round match against the USA in Glasgow.

Kim Sears  is also known for her fiery temper after she was caught swearing on camera in January and then turned up to Murray's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content'

His long-term partner Kim has spent years cheering him on from the sidelines and is set to marry him this spring. 

The tennis star met his match when he first locked eyes with aspiring artist Kim at the US Open back in 2005.

It was a year before the couple went public at a tournament in San Jose, California, where Murray scored his first big win. After the final he found his girlfriend in the crowd and gave her a kiss.

She has been by his side  as he competed across the world ever since - often leading the fashion pack from the stands.

The 27-year-old is also known for her fiery temper after she was caught swearing on camera in January. 

As Andy took on Czech player Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open semi final she was seen calling him a, 'Czech Flash F***.' 

She poked fun at herself the next day when she rocked up to Andy's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content.'
