A brave friend would challenge Ahmed Tafzi to, well, anything - odds are he can and will do it.

Such was the case when he was challenged to smash six watermelons with his head in five seconds at the UpCycle Club in Cyprus.

The footage shows Tafzi lining up the six watermelons on a table, with a woman standing nearby waiting to time him.

He then makes his way along the row of the round fruit - bashing his skull on each one - and breaking each one open in just one hit.

Tafzi, from Germany, took on and completed the challenge with consummate ease but it's no surprise given some of his previous achievements.   

He has previously set the Guinness World Record for most watermelons smashed in one minute - he did 43.

Another previous record, also officially ratified by the authority on remarkable human achievements, came when Tafzi opened 24 bottles with his head.

The Guinness World Records said: 'Tafzi aimed for 50 crushed watermelons laid out for him on his official attempt, but could smash "only" 43.

'His attempt drew such attention in town that one of the witnesses who came to help verify the attempt was the city mayor himself.'
