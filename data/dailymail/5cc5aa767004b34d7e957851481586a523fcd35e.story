A junior ice hockey coach has been sentenced to 15 days in jail for tripping a young player during a post game handshake.

Martin Tremblay, 48, swept out the leg of a youngster while the teams were going through the traditional hockey ritual of lining up to congratulate each other after the match.

Two players, a ten-year-old and a 13-year-old, fell to the ice following Tremblay's moment of madness. The move was caught on video and has worked its way around the Internet.

Congratulations: He approaches the first opposition player and offers his hand, without showing any sign of what is to come

Moment of madness: Tremblay suddenly sticks out a leg and brings down one of the youngsters

Tremblay has been sentenced to 15 days in jail after admitting one count of assault in November last year.

A spectator caught the assault on video and swiftly uploaded it onto YouTube, where it was viewed more than a million times.

The incident unfolded in June last year 
when youth teams from Richmond, British Columbia, and Vancouver were 
playing at the University of British Columbia.

Sentence: Martin Tremblay has been jailed for 15 days after deliberately tripping a 13-year-old ice hockey player after a match in Canada

The crowd's cheers quickly turn to boos 
and outrage as they witness the Vancouver Hornets coach tripping the 
boys. As the two boys lie on the floor, Tremblay turns and aggressively 
points at them.

The Vancouver Hornets had just won Saturday's game when the victorious coach lashed out. The 13-year-old injured his wrist during the incident and had 
to wear a cast.

Tremblay, whose son played for his 
team, must serve the jail sentence at a provincial corrections centre.

Tremblay's team had won 5-4 against 
the Richmond Steel, during which he repeatedly ridiculed the teenager, 
the court heard. He is said to have called the boy 'twinkle toes' and 
insulted his skating.

When the teams went back to the locker room, the coach admitted he deliberately tripped the child,  the Ottowa Citizen reports.

Provincial court Judge Patrick Chen said 'society will not tolerate the assault of children by adults.' He
said the sentence was a 'signal to other parents' about their behaviour
during children's sports events, according to the Citizen.

Tension during the match had reportedly begun between Tremblay and the 13-year-old 
when the teen scored the opening goal.

The Crown had previously asked for a 
sentence of 30 days under house arrest and probation for Tremblay, but 
Judge Chen decided to impose the jail term for the attack which he 
described as a 'cowardly sucker punch on an unsuspecting victim.'

Tremblay's
defence lawyer said he will likely never coach hockey again and has 
also been barred from his position as a leader with Scouts Canada, 
according to the Ottowa Citizen.

Shocking: Two players, one aged 10 and the other 13, stumble and hit the ice as the other players look on

Aggressive: There had reportedly been tension between the Vancouver coach and the 13-year-old throughout the game
