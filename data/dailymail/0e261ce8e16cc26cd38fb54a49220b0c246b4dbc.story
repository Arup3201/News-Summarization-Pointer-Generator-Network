A mother-of-two has won almost £10,000 in damages from cosmetics firm Avon after she was unfairly dismissed after being told 'If you wish to have a family life then this is not the job for you'.

Shauna Connelly told an employment tribunal she felt pressured into working 60-hour weeks despite only being contracted for 40 - and said the firm's 'hypocritical' treatment of her flew in the face of its slogan: 'Avon - the company for women.'

The tribunal, in Newcastle, found that she was unfairly dismissed 
from Avon and that the firm covered up evidence of 'bullying' when 
investigating her grievance. She has been awarded almost £10,000 in damages.

Tribunal: Shauna Connelly has won almost £10,000 in damages from cosmetics giant Avon after being unfairly dismissed. The tribunal heard her line manager made derogatory comments towards her

The 46-year-old, of West Denton, Newcastle, had worked at Avon for nine years and says that initially she 'absolutely loved' her job.

She spent five years working for the company on a freelance basis as a sales representative.

But in 2008, Mrs Connelly, who has two boys now aged 18 and 13, became employed by Avon as an area manager on a permanent contract - and that was when the problems began.

She said: 'I had been number one for sales in my area, I was good at my job. I really believed in Avon as a company, and I loved the products.

'I was told that I'd be working around 40-hours a week in my new position. However, pretty much as soon as I started I was told I needed to work 60-hour weeks if I wanted to reach my targets.'

In August 2011, with the recession in full-swing, she, along with other area managers working for the company, failed to meet some of her targets.

She was called to what she was told 
would be an informal 'chat' at a hotel but was shocked when she turned 
up and discovered it was in fact a meeting held to discuss her 
performance.

Mrs Connelly 
had assumed the meeting would be held in private, but was distressed 
when it was conducted in the foyer of a busy hotel in full view of 
guests.

The tribunal ruling 
states: 'The background to the complaint of unfair dismissal was the 
conduct of Ms Armstrong in relation to the complainant.

'We considered that the former must have known that the discussion on August 2 would amount to a concern meeting.

Colleagues: Mrs Connelly with her former line manager Joan Armstrong (left). She claims staff made derogatory comments about Miss Armstrong and the comments were never revealed to her

'However, her failure to notify the 
claimant in advance of that fact or to arrange a more private venue than
the main reception area of a large hotel accorded with the respondent's
usual practice in these situations.'

The
tribunal accepted the meeting itself did not amount to bullying on that
occasion, but Mrs Connelly says it was at this point that she claims she was told 
that if she wished to have a 'family life' with her partner and two boys 
then the job was not for her.

She
said: 'After the meeting I started to feel really ill, I went to see a 
doctor who told me if carried on working, I was in danger of having a 
stroke. My blood pressure was sky high.

'I felt I had no choice but to go off sick.'

She
put in a formal grievance about her treatment that same month and 
colleagues of her line manager Joan Armstrong were asked to give feedback about her 
(Miss Armstrong's) performance.

One member of staff described Miss Armstrong as: 'Inconsistent, Jekyll and Hyde, some managers are frightened of her.'

Problems: Mrs Connelly, pictured when she worked for Avon, had worked at Avon for nine years and says that initially she 'absolutely loved' her job until she was handed a permanent contract and struggled to meet targets

The colleague added: 'She has no respect or consideration for work, life balance. She can have an aggressive manner on the phone. She tells managers to work nights and weekends.

'She is unapproachable and untrustworthy and lacks empathy.'

There were also number of positive comments including one response from a staff member which said: 'Allows you to make your own mistakes then supports you afterwards, available at any time' and added that she is 'no pushover and doesn't make things personal'. However, the majority of responses were negative.

Despite a number of meetings between Avon and Mrs Connelly the nature of some of the feedback about Miss Armostrong was never revealed.

She was repeatedly told there was no evidence of bullying, but only some 'development' issues.

In February 2012 Mrs Connelly resigned, as she said she felt she was being misled by Avon and had no choice.

The tribunal panel ruling stated 'The matter, to adopt a cliché, was to be swept under the carpet.

'The claimant - who, so far as they knew, was not aware of the results of the anonymous questionnaire - was to be told, as before, that there were some 'development' issues which were being pursued with Ms Armstrong but there was no evidence of bullying.

'That was simply not the case.'

Mrs Connelly was awarded £9,500.88 in compensation after the ruling in January this year, but said that she has been left in debt after being forced to resign from her £333 a week job with Avon.

She represented herself throughout the hearing and said she was 'terrified' but happy with the outcome, after which Avon's barrister shook her hand.

After the tribunal, which concluded in January, a spokesperson for Avon said: 'As the company for women, Avon believes in treating our Independent Representatives and employees equitably, with fairness and respect.

'We have a firm commitment to fair play and equal opportunities and as a company our commitment sits at the heart of everything that we do.

'Whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, we are naturally very disappointed at the tribunal's outcome.'
