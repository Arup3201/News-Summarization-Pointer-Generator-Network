Iraqi  forces have recaptured the northern town of Dhuluiya with sources claiming almost 300 ISIS fighters were killed in the battle.

Government security forces fighting alongside Shia militias began their assault of the town on the Tigris River 45 miles north of Baghdad on Sunday with raids by Iraqi helicopter and fighter jets.

By Monday afternoon they had taken control of most areas with ISIS fighters confined to small zones to the north-west where they were surrounded.

By midday Tuesday, following reports of fierce clashes overnight, security sources were claiming that the whole  town was back in government's hands.

Isis fighters are said to have suffered very heavy losses during the final assault.

The extremist group had seized the northern half of Dhuluiya in June as they swept through Northern Iraq almost unchecked.

Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back since it took over key areas of the mainly Sunni Muslim provinces.

Islamic State fighters had occupied the Dhuluiya's northern half since June and surrounded the southern half of Dhuluiya where members of the Sunni al-Jubouri tribe had refused to swear allegiance to the militants.  

The Sunni militants had used neighbouring villages to isolate not only the Jubouri tribesmen fighting Islamic State but also to attack the nearby Shi'ite town of Balad.

The new offensive, launched on Sunday, was meant to break Islamic State's grip around both Balad and Dhuluiya.

The rural areas north of Baghdad between Iraq's capital and Samarra, a shrine city for Shi'ites, has many ISIS strongholds.
