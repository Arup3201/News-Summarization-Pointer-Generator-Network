London Collections: Men kicked off with a bang today as Britain's best designers showcased their sartorial offerings for the coming season.

And if Topshop Men's catwalk is anything to go by, our men will be wrapping up warm in shaggy sheepskin coats and even donning crop tops come Autumn. 

Sir Philip Green's Arcadia brand put on quite the display at The Old Sorting Office.

London Collections: Men kicked off in the capital today with the Topman show, which saw male models take to the runway at The Old Sorting Office in shearling coats, gingham suits and bowler shoes

Seventies-inspired pieces, shearling coats and Dallas-style jackets will be filling the wardrobes of Britain's men next season.

The high street giant also unveiled sharply tailored suits - including one in head-to-toe gingham - and super cool sneakers for an audience that included Nick Grimshaw, Tinie Tempah, Dermot O'Leary, Oliver Cheshire and X Factor winner, Ben Haenow.

Commenting on the collection, Nick Carvell, GQ.co.uk Fashion Editor said: 'Particularly strong, knee-skimming coats this season at Topman Design.' 

The Seventies-inspired collection tapped into the brand's experimental customer with a colourful knitted crop top among the garments showcased 

High-waisted jeans, Dallas-style jackets and pop-art inspired accessories were the order of the day

London Collections: Men is the male equivalent to London Fashion Week and while not yet as popular, it aims to emphasise the creative and commercial importance of British brands and emerging talent in the capital.

It seems that bigger will be better come Autumn, with oversized, full length coats being key on the catwalk

If the Topman catwalk is  to go by, denim will be key for AW15, hemlines lifted and scarves souped up

All events on the schedule - including shows from Barbour, Burberry, Belstaff and Tom Ford - are designed to showcase the breadth of British fashion talent, from the world’s most innovative emerging talents to global menswear brands and Savile Row tailors.

Tinie Tempah, who counts fashionista Cheryl Fernandez-Versini as one of his nearest and dearest, has been hand-picked to be The London Collections: Men ambassador.

The 26-year-old replaces Nick Grimshaw in the role, which sees him promoting all things men's fashion ahead of the London Fashion Week this month.
