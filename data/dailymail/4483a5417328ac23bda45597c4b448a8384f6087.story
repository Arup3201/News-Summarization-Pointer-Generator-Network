A double amputee marine was reportedly mistreated and ‘humiliated to the point of tears’ by Delta Air Line staff during a flight to Washington D.C.

Corporal Christian Brown, of Atlanta, Georgia, was ‘clumsily wheeled to the back row of the plane’ on Sunday, according to a complaint sent to the airline by another outraged passenger and military service member.

Efforts by several fellow military veterans to move Brown from a coach seat to a first class seat offered up by another flyer were rebuffed by the crew, Army Colonel Nickey Knighton wrote in a detailed customer care report to Delta.

Mistreated hero: Corporal Christian Brown, of Atlanta, Georgia, was was reportedly 'humiliated to the point of tears' by Delta Air Line staff during a flight to Washington D.C.

The Delta flight attendants insisted no one could move through the cabin because the doors were being closed for lift-off, Knighton wrote.

Knighton, a former helicopter pilot with nearly 30 years of service, said she had assumed that because Brown boarded last, he would be seated up front for comfort and ease of exit in case of emergency.

Instead Brown was squeezed into a narrow aviation wheelchair that ‘bumped up against stationary aisle seats as he was wheeled through the aircraft,’ Knighton wrote in her complaint.

‘[He] was obviously humiliated by being paraded through the aircraft and was visibly upset. I touched Brown on his shoulders and asked if he was okay. Tears ran down his face, but he did not cry out loud.’

Brown was flying back to Washington with a military ‘escort buddy,’ according to The Washington Post.

He was also reportedly sick during the flight.

Brown’s mother told the Washington 
Post that had she been with her son, ‘it would have turned out a little 
bit differently. I just can’t imagine what it was like for him, being 
that sick. He had a 104-degree fever and he was shaking.’

Loss of limbs: Brown was leading his squad on a foot patrol in Afghanistan's Helmand province when he stepped on an explosive device that blew off both his legs, one above the knee, the other below his hip

Brown lost two of his limbs in Afghanistan one year ago, on December 13, 2011,

He was leading his squad on a foot in the country’s Helmand province when he stepped on an explosive device that blew off both his legs, one above the knee, the other below his hip.

He also lost part of his right index finger.

Brown’s alleged mistreatment was not Delta’s first bungle involving military personnel.

The Atlanta-based airline became the target of a national outrage in June 2011, when two soldiers posted a YouTube video about their experience catching a connecting flight from Baltimore to Atlanta after an 18-hour layover from Afghanistan.

Several in the group of more than 30 service members were charged $200 each to check a fourth bag.

'Hell no': Brown said he will never fly Delta again

Following a wave public and Congressional criticism in response to that video, Delta announced it would allow military personnel and dependents to check extra bags for free. 

In Brown’s case, the solution may be comprehensive sensitivity training for crew members, writes ABC News.

Brown’s ‘story in no way reflects either Delta’s standard operating procedure or the very high regard we hold for our nation’s service members,’ Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said in an email statement responding to Knighton’s complaint letter.

‘We are sorry for the difficulties that transpired and are investigating this event to determine the appropriate next steps.’

After Delta handles the allegations and appropriate next steps, will Brown fly the airline again?

‘Hell, no,’ he told the Washington Post.
