With dozens of properties on sale for upwards of £1million, there is plenty to be shocked at when you walk past an estate agents in Notting Hill.

But unfortunately for Faron Sutaria, the eyebrows of passers-by were also raised when they saw a naked woman writhing around on the TV in its office on a main road in west London.

Robert Bartlett, chief executive of estate agents Chesterton Global, posted a photograph of the TV in the shop-front on Notting Hill Gate showing pornographic channel Babestation earlier this month.

When I said arrange a viewing: Passers-by could view pornography on a TV inside the Faron Sutaria offices in Notting Hill, west London, after a 'mischief-maker' apparently changed the channel

In a Twitter post, the 49-year-old said: ‘Interesting to see what some estate agencies sell at night!’ The photograph was originally taken on October 2 by Twitter user 'TheLondonLuke'.

Staff at Faron Sutaria said there is normally a news station broadcast on the TV in their window, but a prankster appeared to have changed the channel from outside with a universal remote.

A spokesman told Metro: ‘We screen a 24-hour news channel on the television in our window. This was showing correctly when the premises were locked and left on the evening of October 2.

‘We believe a mischief-maker changed the channel on the television from the outside using a universal remote. We have now altered the system so this cannot happen again.’

Adult TV: Babestation has been on air since 2002 and allows viewers to communicate live with naked women

Eton-educated Mr Bartlett, who posted the image on Twitter on October 8, was appointed Chesterton chief in 2006 and has rowed internationally - representing Great Britain in the 1992 Olympic Games.

Faron Sutaria was founded in 1975 and now has nine offices across London. Its most expensive property currently on sale from the Notting Hill branch is a four-bedroom home for £5.6million.

Babestation is a TV sex line which has been on air since 2002, allowing viewers to communicate live with naked women via a premium-rate telephone number or by text messaging.

It was in the news in 2012 when MailOnline reported how a trainee Mormon priest who flashed at two women said he was 'confused' after watching too much of the channel. 

Royston Thompson, 25, of Darlington, County Durham, said his behaviour was merely 'flirting' like the women on Babestation who writhe provocatively while urging callers to ring in.

Separate incident: Two months ago Foxtons, another upmarket London estate agents, came under fire when a young girl was pictured cleaning its offices in Hampstead, north-west London, late at night

And in 2010, glamour model Lori Bucky, of Battersea, south London, was fined £1,000 for claiming benefits while working as a Babestation host -  which earned her up to £4,000 a month.

The incident at Faron Sutaria comes  after Foxtons, another upmarket estate agents, came under fire when a young girl was pictured cleaning its offices in Hampstead, north-west London, late at night.

The girl, who was believed to be aged 10 or 11, was spotted alone inside the branch in August by passers-by at 10.30pm - and could be seen wiping down tables and emptying bins at the agency.

A spokesman for Foxtons said at the time that the girl had been taken to the offices by her mother, who was employed by a cleaning contractor, after her childcare arrangements fell through.
