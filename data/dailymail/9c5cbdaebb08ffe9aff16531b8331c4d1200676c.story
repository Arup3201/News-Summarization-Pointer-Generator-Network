It seems they don't call it retail therapy for nothing: shopping really does make us happy.

So, ladies, you never have to feel guilty about hitting the shopping centre again because new research claims that it can reduce our sadness.

The piece of research, called The Benefits Of Retail Therapy: Making Purchase Decisions Reduces Residual Sadness, which features in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, claims that shopping helps us exert control and therefore reduces feelings of sadness.

Retail therapy...literally: A new study has found that shopping can actually boost our mood and reduce sadness

'Sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one's life. Thus shopping, by restoring control over one's situation, can reduce sadness,' the researchers explain.

The study showed two groups: 'browsers' - window shoppers - and 'choosers', twelve different items.

The study found that 79 percent of the choosers felt that they were more in control while choosing, while just 2 percent of the browsers felt that way.

Researchers also found that the choosers were three times less sad than the browsers.

The perfect excuse to hit the shops? Researchers claim that sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one's life. Thus shopping, by restoring control over one's situation, can reduce sadness

According to The Huffington Post, this is backed up by a 2011 paper that claimed shopping helps boost our mood and that 'the consumption of self-treats can be strategically motivated.'

While treating ourselves to 
something nice may improve our mood, there has also been plenty of contradictory research over the years.

A study from the 
University of Chicago suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is
 futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely.

In
 fact, the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a 
vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely, feels more lonely
 because they have shopped, and continues shopping in a misguided 
attempt to cure the loneliness.
