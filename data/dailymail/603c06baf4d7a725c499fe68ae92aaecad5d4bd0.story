A cafe has found itself at the centre of a social media row after owners barred a customer from their  shop for leaving a negative comment online.

Shopper Helen Forsyth took to Facebook concerned over the way cakes are put on open display at The Shed in Bathford, Somerset.

But the cafe responded online by calling her a 'stupid woman' and has now apparently barred Ms Forsyth from coming back. The Shed also took to Facebook to label her comments 'b******s.'

The online argument has since gone viral.

Shopper Helen Forsyth took to Facebook concerned over the way cakes are put on open display at The Shed in Bathford, Somerset

It is believed the cakes were displayed in accordance with hygiene standards on a traditional cake stand.

The exchange escalated onto Twitter with the cafe threatening her with legal action for making 'defamatory and potentially libellous' comments.

One reply read: 'Please don’t come back - your feedback is b******s! You would need to be a midget with the neck of a giraffe to be able to breathe over them - stupid woman!'

Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol yesterday, Ms Forsyth, from Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, said the response she received had left her shocked.

'I think if businesses use social medial and invite reviews they have to expect them,' she said.

'I was very careful because I realise it was a review and someone’s business, so I was very tempered in my response.

'I was not that damning, I gave them three out of five. 

'There are other reviews lower than mine that got the same response. I didn’t really know whether to be quite upset or just laugh, it was just so ridiculous. 

'It was shocking, from an allegedly professional business, it was really shocking.'

Ms Forsyth posted the review on The Shed’s Facebook page after visiting the cafe on Friday.

In a section entitled ‘reviews’ she wrote: 'The cakes looked amazing and I wanted to try every single one BUT the cakes were on very open display with every customer essentially leaning over them to order. 

'So all the cakes were getting breathed on (or worse) by every single passing person, plus the staff. 

'Which is a crying shame as they really did look extremely good. But due to the above, we just had coffee.'

The remarks provoked a swift reaction from the business, and the row continued throughout the weekend, with Ms Forsyth responding: 'Customers are entitled to have an opinion and if you set up a FB page and invite reviews, you can’t expect every single one to be a 5. 

'It’s unprofessional to resort to attempted bullying in these situations.'

The Shed is run by Fred Cobb and his wife Helen, who also have a boutique guest house at Beach, near Bath. It is not clear who was in charge of the business's social media sites

The Shed hit back hours later, saying: 'Don’t accuse a business of something potentially damaging as their food being ‘unhygienic’ and expect the establishment to lie down and have their "tummy tickled"- what you said was defamatory and potentially libellous - you have to be more responsible for your comments - so stop hiding behind this "bullying" nonsense - we are allowed to defend our brand - or would you prefer to go legal.'

Nigel Morgan, a Wiltshire-based PR firm owner, said on behalf of The Shed that the remarks had reflected the passion of the business for its products and venue.

He said: 'It certainly wasn’t pleasant to see it unfold yesterday. But it was a great venue being passionate about what it does.

'It is passionate about cakes and passionate about food hygiene, but it was a bit too passionate on social media.

'If you question a food business’s hygiene, they are bound to see red.'

Mr Morgan said the business had apologised for calling Ms Forsyth stupid, and said it would like to talk properly to her.

He stressed that cakes were displayed in total accordance with food hygiene rules.

Following the social media storm bookings increased at The Shed and they described Sunday as people 'were coming to see what all the fuss was about'.
