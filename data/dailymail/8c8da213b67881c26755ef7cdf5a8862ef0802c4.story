One of Britain's most historic stately homes is set to reopen to the public after around £5m worth of renovations that have restored Kenwood House to its former beauty.

Eight rooms have been re-presented and reinterpreted to reference different periods in the building's history.

They have been redecorated to reference the period during the 18th century when the house was bought by William Murray, the 1st Earl of Mansfield.

Kenwood House, on the northern edge of Hampstead Heath, has undergone a major refurbishment that includes a recreation of the original Robert Adam interiors

Maddy Wall from English Heritage is one of the many staff who have been involved in the project. She is pictured in the Great Stairs at the house

Efforts have been made by the conservation charity to painstakingly refurbish and in some cases recreate the original grand interiors. A close-up of the the ceiling of the library shows the level of detail involved

Brewing magnate Edward Cecil Guinness, first Earl of Iveagh, bought Kenwood House and estate in 1925.

When he died in 1927,  the first Earl of Iveagh bequeathed the house, estate and part of his collection of pictures to the nation for the members of the public to enjoy

He commissioned the renown architect Robert Adam to remodel it from 1764–1779.

After a lengthy renovation, The Adam 
rooms at the Hampstead Heath home have been represented to show as 
accurately as possibly the original interior.

According to Heritage England, who 
carried out the work, visitors will be encouraged to relax and enjoy the
new interiors, take in the view and discover the stories of Kenwood.

The library at Kenwood House is one of the most picturesque rooms in the property. It will be open to the public when the refurbishment is complete later this month

Kenwood contains purchases from a sale of objects from Scone Palace. These include silver tableware, four chairs in the Chinese Chippendale style and a family portrait by Sir Peter Lely

The Iveagh Bequest includes important paintings by many great artists, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Reynolds and Gainsborough.

The rooms displaying the Iveagh 
Bequest, referencing the time when the house was donated to the nation 
by Lord Iveagh a member of the Guinness brewing family, have been 
presented to suggest an 18th-century gentleman's lifestyle, in keeping 
with the former owner's original wishes.

Kenwood is known for its fascinating 
social and political history, with links to law reform, slavery, brewing
and philanthropy told through the lives of the people who lived and 
worked there.

The newly refurbished rooms now feature family trails, an interactive dolls house, original letters and architectural designs.

Also in situ are priceless collection of artworks by Rembrandt, Van Dyke and Gainsborough which were originally owned by Lord Iveagh.

They have spent nearly a year on the road as the Heath’s famous stately home closed its doors for the restoration.

English Heritage curator Laura Houliston, replaces books in the 
library. The property's reopening has been lauded as a chance for adults and children to learn about one of the country's historic homes

Furnishings on the outside of the house, such as these period metal benches have been given a touch-up ahead of the reopening. Inside, Wendy Richardson, a member of the Conservation Team, cleans a bookshelf in the Library

The house, dating from the 1600s, was
closed from the start of April while vital roof repairs are done and 
the landmark cream facade is stripped down and repaired.

The art collection will traveled to three galleries in America in a year-long tour called the Art of Kenwood in London.

Paul Griffiths who oversaw the work as English Heritage’s area manager for historic properties in and around London said: 'This really is [architect Robert] Adam’s masterpiece '

The Guitar Player by Johannes Vermeer, on display at Kenwood House, is just one of the works of art which were bequeathed to the nation

The grand entrance hall, the ceiling of which can be seen above, is the first room guests will enter when they visit the soon to be open attraction

The interior of the entrance hall, above, were originally remodelled by renowned architect Robert Adam between 1764 and 1779 for the first Earl of Mansfield

The gilded surround of a mirror, above, is typical of the furnishings which adorn the neo-classical house

Dee Alston, a member of the Conservation Team, cleans a bust of Lord Mansfield the previous owner of the home, right. It has pride of place in the ornate Library

'It is one of the great stately homes
of England. The library is simply incredible and visitors come from all
over the world to see it.'

As well as representing the rooms, Mr
Griffith’s team has also had to track the flues of 100 chimneys which 
has to repointed and swept.

The work, which took the best part of a year is now drawing to a close with a reopening date set for Thursday, November 28.

The dining room of the house features some of the most valuable artwork in the house including paintings by Vermeer

Where the interiors had been damaged or removed, efforts have been made to restore the Adams designs to their former glory, as seen here in the entrance hall

The house is set to reopen to the public later this month
