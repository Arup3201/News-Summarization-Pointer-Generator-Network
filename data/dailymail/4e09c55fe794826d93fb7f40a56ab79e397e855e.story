A model who was  called 'ugly' by classmates has beaten the bullies by becoming a beauty queen.

Rebekah Hemsley, 23, was constantly picked on until the torment became so severe she had to be home schooled. 

But now the casino hostess from Nottingham, who now models part-time for promotional photographers, is intent on becoming winning the Miss England title.

Rebekah's confidence was destroyed by daily taunts at school but modelling helps boost her self-esteem

Rebekah Hemsley was so badly bullied about her looks that she had to be home schooled. Now she's a model

'Everyone through my life pushed me down and said I was ugly - they convinced me my nose was the worst in the school.'

As well as verbally abusing her, Rebekah faced physical attacks. One student, knowing that she had hayfever, shoved grass down her jumper to make her cry.

When she got to secondary school, the bullying only got worse and she was regularly called 'anorexic' and picked on because of the shape of her nose. 

After switching school failed to solve the problem, her mother resorted to arranging for a home tutor to get Rebekah through her GCSEs as she was scared of entering the classroom.

But now she has proven her cruel classmates wrong by becoming a successful model, signed to two agencies, who is now competing for the chance to be Miss England.

Yet Rebekah's bid to fight back almost faltered when she was diagnosed with endometriosis a year ago.

As a child Rebekah was constantly teased about her nose and was called anorexic by her peers 

Despite the chronic pain caused by the condition, which affects the lining of the womb, Rebekah has vowed not to give up her dream of pageanting.

And now she's vying for the Miss England title  after being picked to enter from a simple selfie.

Rebekah sent this selfie to apply for Miss England and was selected to compete the next day

After seeing a call for entrants to the competition, Rebekah admitted an image of herself and thought nothing of it.

But a day later she was invited to an audition and she is now in a heat to make it through to the Miss England semi-finals where she will compete against women from all over the country for the main title.

Rebekah is appealing for votes on Facebook where the public can help send her through to the next round.

Rebekah says that the competition is of particular importance to her as she wants to inspire others to achieve their dreams.  

'I wanted to do Miss England because it just goes to show that anyone can make it if you put your mind to it.

'Thanks to the help of a counsellor and my very supportive boyfriend, family and friends, I have grown so much and I realised that I could be an example to people about how you can turn your life around. 

'I was bullied so badly I sometimes cry just thinking about how cruel children can be.

'I was terrified of going to school because my confidence had been so battered.

'And now I couldn't be more different - everyone has noticed that I'm different - I've gone from being 100 per cent introvert to being loud and proud.'

Rebekah says she now realises that she never had anything to worry about when it came to her appearance. 

'And I know now that the bullies were just jealous. They were calling me ugly and mocking me about my nose just as modelling agencies were signing me up to be on their books. 

Rebekah was diagnosed with endometriosis but won't let it affect her chances of winning Miss England

Miss England hopeful Rebekah wants to show that no matter what the bullies say, everyone is beautiful

'Being a model has helped me grow in confidence. Going to castings has given me a thick skin and encouraged me loads - people actually want to take my photo!'

Overcoming obstacles has made Rebekah even more determined to win the competition.

'Even though I've been diagnosed with a horrible condition and my endometriosis causes me pain every day, I don't see why that should stop me from achieving my goals,' she said.

'I'm in the running to represent the country and I'd love to be able to show that no matter what the bullies say, everyone is beautiful.'
