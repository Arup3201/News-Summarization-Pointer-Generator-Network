The Duchess of Cambridge might have cornered the royal style icon niche but it seems there's room for at least one more royal fashionista.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex has been named the London College of Fashion's first ever patron and will lend her support to the College's 'Better Lives' campaign, which aims to use fashion to change the world, reduce the industry's environmental footprint and help those in need. 

The London College of Fashion has produced of a roll call of famous alumni, including footwear designers Jimmy Choo and Beatrix Ong, rising star William Tempest, and Harold Tillman chairman of the British Fashion Council.

The Countess' three-year stint as patron will involve finding time to visit 'Better Lives' projects, which currently include one that works with prisons to help rehabilitate female offenders and get them into work on their release.

Professor Frances Corner, head of the London College of Fashion, said: ‘We are very 
proud to have The Countess of Wessex’s support and look forward to 
working with her.

'This is a very exciting time for the college and HRH’s
Patronage strengthens the innovative work that we do and the 
contribution we will continue to make to the future of the fashion 
industry.'Although the Countess hasn't always been known for her fashion sense, the last few years have seen a sea-change in the first lady of Wessex' personal style.Gone are the frumpy jackets and oversized hats that characterised the first few years of her married life, while in their place are chic shift dresses, nude courts and flattering hats.
