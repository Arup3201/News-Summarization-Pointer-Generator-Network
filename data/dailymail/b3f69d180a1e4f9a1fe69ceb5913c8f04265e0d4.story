Gary Walker, NHS whistleblower and former Hospital chief executive for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust, says bullying is rampant in the NHS

The former boss of a hospital which is being investigated over high death rates today described a culture of 'sheer bullying' in the NHS.

Gary Walker, former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT), said he was threatened by East Midlands Strategic Health Authority (SHA) when he flagged up hospital capacity problems.

The whistleblower, who claimed he was sacked after raising concerns about patient safety, said he felt pressured by officials when he put the hospital on 'red alert' because it was almost full to capacity.

He said: 'The response from the health authority was, "This is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand".

'It is a very dangerous thing to be trying to push through targets when hospitals are dangerously over full.'

Mr Walker, who was sacked in 2010 for 'gross professional misconduct' over alleged swearing at a meeting, said he was forced to quit after refusing to meet Whitehall targets for non-emergency patients and was gagged from speaking out as part of a settlement deal.

He added that in February 2009 he met Dame Barbara Hakin - who has been named interim chief operating officer of the NHS Commissioning Board - and 'essentially certain threats were made to me like, "If you don’t deliver the targets then I won’t be able to protect you". She denies the claims.

'In essence there was a lot of pressure to deliver the targets and this was going to reflect on me as an individual if we didn’t meet those targets.

'At the same time I am asking for a capacity review, for help, and the situation escalated, when the hospital became more and more full more and more threats were made.'

He said he prepared a presentation for the Department of Health about problems with hitting targets but was ordered to remove any reference to him calling for a capacity review.

He said: 'If you upset the SHA, particularly the one I was working for, there would be repercussions for you. You work in that environment as best you can.

Target chasing: Mr Walker flagged up capacity problems but said he was told: 'This is your problem - you need to meet the targets whatever the demand'

'I spoke with other (hospital) chief executives and many of them, but not all, concurred with my view of the health authority that they were only ever interested if you’re going to suggest there is a problem anywhere, and they are very heavy-handed with how that problem is going to be resolved, so threats are made, people are told, "You realise the consequences if this doesn’t get done?".

'This isn’t proper management, this is just sheer bullying.'

The former chairman of the trust, David Bowles, added that there is a culture in the health service of 'making things look good rather than being good'.

Mr Bowles, who also resigned in 2009, said the SHA deliberately hid financial troubles at the trust from senior Department of Health officials.

He said: 'For whatever reason, the way the accounting system was running, (some) deficits were effectively doubled for a while because of strange quirks in the accounting system.

Hidden: David Bowles, former chairman of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, says financial problems in the trust were concealed

'The Government realised it, decided to put it right, issued a press release saying: "These are the trusts that are affected, we are going to adjust their accounts by these amounts".

'ULHT should have been on that schedule and should have received compensation from the Government circa £11 million. We were not on that schedule.

'When I raised it with my director of finance, I was told we were not on that schedule because this trust is not to receive a cash adjustment because the SHA did not wish to identify any trusts in the East Midlands as being financially challenged.

'The very clear implication of that is that the financial distress in ULHT was being deliberately concealed from the centre to make the SHA look good.

'It is a sign of that culture of not owning up to problems, not being transparent.

The trust is one of 14 being investigated by health chiefs over high mortality rates in the wake of the public inquiry report into serious failures at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

Mr Bowles told the Health Select Committee: 'If you read the Mid Staffs report it says things like "bullying, target driven priorities, denial" and it goes on and says this was not only in Mid Staffordshire - they collected evidence that it existed elsewhere and I can assure you it existed in this part of the health economy.

'There is this deeply ingrained culture of making things look good rather than things actually being good.'

He said that the trust was at 'tipping point' but was told once again to 'meet targets regardless of demand'.

He added: 'I was in our situation rooms where staff were desperate for the next bed for an emergency patient and I’m being told, "treat your non urgent patients".

'I found that absolutely scandalous.'

Mr Bowles told MPs that staff were frightened to raise concerns about bullying for fear they might lose their jobs, adding: 'If you look at Gary now, he blew the whistle, he has applied for 50 or 60 jobs and not got even one interview.

'That is the culture you are dealing with here.'

NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has refused to step down following the Stafford Hospital scandal

Mr Bowles said the culture of bullying and fear in the NHS can only change if there are changes to the leadership.

He said: 'There is too much evidence emerging that this was not just Mid Staffordshire and you have to look at who sets the overarching culture and that is set by Sir David Nicholson and I have to say that it is deeply ingrained.

'I do not think you can change the culture of the NHS without changing its leaders.'

Mr Walker asked what under fire NHS boss Sir David has done in the last six years to promote whistle blowing in the health service.

Mr Walker also claimed that Dame Barbara Hakin, the former chief executive of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority, authorised his pay off to protect herself

'As far as I can see, it is much, much worse now than it has ever been,' he said.

Mr Walker also claimed that Dame Barbara Hakin, the former chief executive of the East Midlands SHA who is now the interim deputy chief of NHS Commissioning Board, authorised his pay off to protect herself, a claim she denies.

He said: 'If it is the case that Barbara Hakin is responsible for that payment that is a very serious charge, potentially of misconduct, on the basis that you can’t use public money to silence matters of your own misconduct.'

He added: 'This use of public money to cover up individual failings is a major problem.'

A spokesman for the East Midlands SHA, now part of NHS Midlands and East, said: 'NHS Midlands and East, as the successor body for NHS East Midlands, has today presented evidence to the House of Commons Health Select Committee (HSC) on behalf of NHS East Midlands, which challenges the claim by Gary Walker, the former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, that he raised patient safety concerns as a whistleblower.

'The material makes it clear that it was NHS East Midlands, the strategic health authority (now part of NHS Midlands and East), which was concerned about patient safety at the trust.

'The evidence presented to the HSC makes it clear that there has never been any finding that Gary Walker had raised genuine concerns that would constitute his designation as a whistleblower.

'Now that the compromise agreement between Mr Walker and his employers, which referred to his employment status and his dismissal, has been set aside the SHA is in a position to put its view of events into the public domain which it has not been able to do before.'
