Ringleader: Valeen, 27, the oldest of the three, is in charge of scoring drugs for the trio

Valeen, 27, was the most popular girl in school and was headed to college; middle sister Amanda, 25, was homecoming queen and aspired to become a dental hygienist, and Tiffany, 22, the baby of the family, was a star athlete. 

But somewhere along the way all three girls have fallen under the spell of heroin, which has become the drug of choice for the trio and the thing that binds them together.

‘Once we found out that each other was using, we were, like, what the hell? We might as well all get high together,’ Valeen says in the video.

For the three sisters, each day begins the same way.

The sisters before they became addicted to heroin - they now all shot up together

'When we wake up in the morning, the first thing on our minds is to get high,' Valeen says in the video.

Cameras were rolling as the three young women got into a car and headed to meet up with Valeen's drug dealer to score $140 worth of heroin.

With drugs in hand, the sisters rush home to get their morning fix, but Valeen cannot wait that long and injects the heroin into her vein on the ride over.

Can't wait: Valeen begins her day by contacting her drug dealer and driving out to meet him to buy heroin, which she injects right in the car on her way home

Out cold: By 12.30pm, the three sisters lie in a heroin-induced stupor

‘Heroin is my drug of choice,’ Amanda says. ‘At first I was sniffing it, then it turned into shooting it, and now I need it.’

Tiffany, who only recently was released from jail after being arrested for a fourth time on drug charges, was forced to start shooting heroin into her legs after all her other veins collapsed.

‘It's just a vicious cycle of misery,' a somber Tiffany says.

As they arrive home, Valeen, Amanda and Tiffany grab their needles and settle in to get high together. By 12.30pm, all three are lying in a heroin-induced stupor.

‘I can't look at my daughters ‘cause I hate them. They're disgusting. I'm embarrassed by them, I'm ashamed,’ says the girls’ mother, Linda, who herself had struggled with a cocaine addiction when her daughters were younger.

Broken: Valeen turned to prostitution to support her and her sisters' drug habit, and she eventually lost custosdy of her daughter

Glimmer of hope: Dr Phil offered to send the girls to rehab, provided that they agree to go to three different clinics to avoid triggering one another

The heroin addiction has come to dominate every aspect of the sisters’ life, with disastrous results.

Valeen, a slender, striking brunette, has turned to having sex with older men for money to support her and her sisters’ drug habit, and Amanda also recently got into prostitution to pitch in.

The 27-year-old woman, described as the leader of the trio, has tried cleaning up her act by entering rehab, but her sobriety did not last long. Valeen eventually lost custody of her daughter after injecting heroin in her presence.

The young woman also tearfully admitted to Dr Phil that she often drives while high.

Dr Phil estimated that cumulatively, the three sisters have shot up heroin 36,500 times.

The show ended on a hopeful note, with Dr Phil offering to send the three girls to rehab, provided that they agree to go to three different clinics to avoid triggering one another, and later part ways indefinitely.
