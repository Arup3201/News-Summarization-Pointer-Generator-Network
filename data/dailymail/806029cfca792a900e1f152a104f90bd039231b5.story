Murdoch fixer Fred Michel launched a relentless campaign of schmoozing to win influence with David Cameron’s most senior advisers.

During the Murdoch empire’s bid for BskyB Mr Michel sent and received 799 text messages to individuals in the Culture Department, as well as 191 telephone calls and 158 emails.

Relations were so warm between No 10 and the Murdoch empire that the Prime Minister’s director of communications Craig Oliver enjoyed a social dinner with Mr Michel just two days after it emerged that the News of the World hacked the phone messages of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Mr Michel also revealed that Mr Cameron’s press secretary Gabby Bertin sent text messages to News International boss Rebekah Brooks on the same day.

Evidence submitted by Mr Michel, the former News Corporation director of public affairs, shows he bombarded special advisers in Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Culture with more than 1,000 text messages.

Mr Michel revealed that he was also in touch with Mr Cameron’s former communications director Andy Coulson, his policy gurus Steve Hilton and Rohan Silva and he also admitted lobbying Chancellor George Osborne’s special adviser Rupert Harrison for favours.

Robert Jay, counsel for the inquiry, revealed that Mr Michel had sought a meeting at a ‘discreet location’ with Mr Oliver and News International troubleshooter Will Lewis.

Mr Michel said: ‘The dinner was going to be with the wives. There were two locations floated and we ended up in a location which was not discreet at all.’

Downing Street was forced to step in last night amid claims that Mr Oliver should have declared the meeting under the civil service code of conduct.

Mr Cameron’s official spokesman revealed that ‘the meeting was on July 6 last year’ but did not have to be declared since Mr Oliver and Mr Michel split the bill and civil servants only have to declare hospitality, not meetings, with media figures.

‘Craig Oliver’s contact with Fred Michel was entirely appropriate. It was a social occasion and originally had been for Craig to meet Will Lewis, Fred Michel and their wives but Will Lewis dropped out because his wife had given birth. They paid for their own meals.’

But the timing of the meeting raises questions about the wisdom of a senior No 10 figure meeting with a Murdoch envoy as the Milly Dowler hacking scandal had erupted.

The Leveson Inquiry heard that Mr Michel sent a text to Gabby Bertin on 6 July 2011 saying: ‘Thank you for your messages to Rebekah last night.’

Mr Michel told the Inquiry: ‘I don’t know what the message contained. I only knew that Rebekah told me she had got messages from Gabby.’

Mr Jay said the messages might be ‘the indirect communication’ from Mr Cameron that Mrs Brooks revealed when she gave evidence.

But Miss Bertin said last night that she was not passing on messages from the Prime Minister.

‘They were personal texts to Rebekah. I was not an emissary. I didn’t send anything on behalf of the Prime Minister.’

Friends said she told Mrs Brooks that she had fought hard for the families of murdered children when she was editor of the News of the World, including another murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne.

The Inquiry also heard that Mr Michel unsuccessfully sought two favours from George Osborne’s most senior aide Rupert Harrison. In November 2010, Mr Michel texted him to get the Chancellor to lobby Business Secretary Vince Cable, who was then in charge of the BskyB bid, to push it through.

‘It would be helpful if George were to send a letter to Vince on our Sky merger and its economic importance separate from the Ofcom process. Do you think it’s a possibility? I can of course help with the content. Best, Fred.’

In July the following year, when the Dowler scandal was raging, he asked for a senior politician to condemn hacking but insist on a police investigation – an apparent attempt to prevent a public inquiry into the hacking. Neither request led to results.

Mr Michel confessed that he was a ‘text obsessive’ and was also in touch with Nick Clegg’s senior aides Lena Pietsch and Jonny Oates.

Mr Michel often exchanged messages in cod French and provoked the same response in others. When he praised one performance at the despatch box, the Culture Secretary responded: ‘Merci. Large drink tonight.’
