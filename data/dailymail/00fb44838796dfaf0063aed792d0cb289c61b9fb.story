George H.W. Bush must spend at least some of Christmas in the hospital after doctors ordered him to remain under observation for a second night following his admission for shortness of breath. 

The 90-year-old former president will stay at Houston's Methodist Hospital on Wednesday night 'as a precaution until doctors can evaluate whether he is healthy enough to return home. 

He was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday night with shortness of breath as wife Barbara read 'Twas the Night Before Christmas to children with NFL star JJ Watt at a public event.  

Family spokesman Jim McGrath said Bush - who is the oldest living president - had a 'good day' and his prognosis 'remains positive.'

Bush is the oldest living former commander in chief. He was hospitalized for seven weeks in January 2013 for a bacterial infection and a cough - but later discharged

It's not known whether the former commander in chief will be allowed to return home on Thursday to celebrate at least part of Christmas with his family.

Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. 

President Barack Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, has been notified about Bush's hospital admission.

'President Obama and the first lady send their good wishes to the former president and the entire Bush family during this holiday season,' said White House spokesman Eric Schultz.

Bush made two public appearances last month. He attended an event at Texas A&M University with his son, former President George W. Bush, and served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the US Armed Forces.

The elder Bush was a naval aviator in World War II — at one point the youngest in the Navy — and was shot down over the Pacific.

Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well

Bush served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy.

The elder Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston.

Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. 

Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, made a surprise visit with Houston Texans' JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston on Tuesday evening to perform 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.'

It's not clear whether she was with the 41st U.S. president when he experienced his shortness of breath  

Methodist Hospital is rated as the top hospital in Texas by US News & World Report. It is ranked nationally, as well.
