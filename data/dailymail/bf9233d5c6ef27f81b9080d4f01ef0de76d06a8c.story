It was Anfield's turn to bare the brunt of the tail-end of Hurricane Gonzalo when part of a scoreboard was blown off on the eve of Liverpool's mammoth Champions League tie with Real Madrid.

Three days after Newcastle's Premier League match against Leicester was delayed by an hour due to a safety issue with a new giant screen at St James' Park, Liverpool had their own problems.

Brendan Rodgers welcomes Cristiano Ronaldo and his Real team-mates to a blustery Anfield on Wednesday night, and the Liverpool manager will be keen for no similar disruptions.

Rodgers can only hope his defence is not blown over as easily as they were against Premier League bottom-club QPR on Sunday.

The £10million attacking trio of Bobby Zamora, Charlie Austin and Eduardo Vargas at Loftus Road created problems that Liverpool's back four struggled to deal with.

The £80m arrival of Ronaldo, averaging more than two goals per game this year, is sure to test Liverpool's Champions League credentials.

Rodgers remains without Daniel Sturridge, whose calf injury will keep him out for 'two to four weeks'.

Rodgers may be forced to rely on Mario Balotelli, who has scored one goal since making his £16m move from AC Milan.
