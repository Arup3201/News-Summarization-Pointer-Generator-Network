The Goldsmiths finally called a Twitter truce yesterday to their increasingly bitter marital row.

After a week spent publicly trading insults on the  social networking site, multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith and his wife Kate decided their ugly break-up should become private.

However, their apparent  truce was immediately put to the test, after it emerged that the Rothschild heiress's alleged lover, US rapper Jay Electronica, posted a photo of her on his Twitter page.

The picture, captioned 
'@KateRoundtable (her Twitter user name) at the Watch The Helicopter 
tour', is likely to inflame the bitter break-up.

The rapper also recently tweeted: 'The handling of the heart is a very delicate art cause it's paper thiiiiin (sic).'

Mrs Goldsmith had been branded 
'appalling' by her  husband over her relationship with Electronica – 
prompting a succession of extraordinary tweets from her.

She claimed her 'life had been saved' 
by the rapper, accused her husband of cheating on her and being 
'irrational', and said she was merely responding to the 'vultures' 
taunting her.

Yesterday, however, the  prospect of 
an acrimonious 'Twitter divorce' battle between two of the world's most 
famous banking dynasties appeared to have led to an agreement.

In a joint statement the couple said: 'We are both deeply saddened that our marriage has ended after nine years.

'It is a matter of regret that, at a 
time when our emotions and those of our friends have run high, things 
have been said in public which should have been kept private. We accept 
our share of responsibility.

'There will be no further comment.' 
News of the split emerged last weekend after police arrested Mr 
Goldsmith at the couple's £20million family home in Kensington, West 
London on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

It reportedly followed a confrontation
 between the Eton-educated financier, the youngest son of Sir James 
Goldsmith, and his 29-year-old wife over explicit texts and emails 
between her and Electronica.

Mr Goldsmith, 31, who inherited 
£300million, was released without charge after accepting a caution.  He 
later announced he was filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery.

It provoked an ugly war of  words between the couple which culminated in the tweets by Mrs Goldsmith on Thursday.

In 14 messages posted in quick 
succession, the music producer – who calls herself Kate Rothschild on 
Twitter – wrote: 'Our marriage went bad a few years ago and none of you 
have any idea what I went through along with my husband. My husband is a
 brilliant and incredible man... but relationships can go wrong. This is
 the darkest time of my life.'

In response to a Twitter user who 
wrote: 'Imagine if you'd been cheated on', she replied: 'I have, several
 times.' By yesterday morning all the messages had been deleted.

Electronica, 35, refused to comment 
last night. But a neighbour said: 'Jay is a perfect Southern gentleman. 
Kate is absolutely lovely. They are a lovely couple.'

It is not the first time that a Rothschild heiress has put everything on the line to pursue an edgy musician.

The alleged affair between Kate Goldsmith and rapper Jay Electronica echoes that of her great aunt, who left her husband and five children to live with a jazz artist in the 1950s.

In both cases, their family and friends were mystified and shocked by their behaviour.

Kathleen Annie Pannonica Rothschild, the Baroness Nica de Koenigswarter, who was nicknamed Nica, first became infatuated by pianist Thelonious Monk after being introduced to jazz by her brother, Victor Rothschild – Mrs Goldsmith’s grandfather.

She moved to New York and became consumed by the jazz scene, where she was known as ‘The Baroness’. There she helped to support many struggling musicians, arranging for rehearsal space and transporting them to clubs in her Bentley.

By 1954 her marriage to a wealthy French diplomat and war hero, Baron Jules de Koenigswarte, was over and she lost custody of her children.

She later hit the headlines after Charlie Parker, the jazz saxophonist and composer, died in her hotel suite – a scandal that cast a dark shadow over the rest of her life.

However, her relationship with Monk was to endure for three decades until his death in 1982.

Monk – who would go on to become a giant of 20th century music – would later move into her New Jersey home,  which served as a sanctuary for ageing jazz musicians.
