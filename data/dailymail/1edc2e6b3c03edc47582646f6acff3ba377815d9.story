Snoozing on a sofa, this glossy black labrador looks remarkably comfortable. But she is not the only one.

Thanks to the popularity of this charming picture, a mysterious photographer is enjoying huge worldwide success.

The snap of Dilly the dog has attracted more than 10 million views online across the globe while the snapper has sold tens of thousands of greeting cards containing the image.

The 48-year-old photographer, known only as ‘Villager Jim’, does not want any recognition for his talents - and is keeping his identity a secret.

The father-of-two, of Foolow, Derbyshire, said: 'It all started 18 months ago when I took a picture of my labrador falling asleep in her chair and it went viral.

'It has gained so much interest across the world but it gained notoriety in the U.S. particularly because of an incorrect internet rumour the dog in the picture actually previously belonged to a soldier who had been killed in Iraq.

'Somebody put the photograph on a story to do with a soldier being killed in Iraq.

'The story was complete rubbish, but it the picture went massive - I tried to correct the mistake, but you can’t control something like that.'

But the response to the picture encouraged him to develop his interest in photography.

He sold prints of the labrador picture to local pubs and it has been so successful that his primary business of running holiday accommodation in the

Peak District is now being overtaken by the interest in his images of animals and nature scenes.

He said: 'I would go to the pub on a Friday night for a quiet pint and then the landlord would constantly be pointing tourists in my direction, saying that I was the guy that took the labrador picture.

'But I don’t want any fuss really. The anonymity brings with it a degree of mystique and people are starting to become fascinated with finding out who I am.

'Only a few close friends, associates, and my family know that I am Villager Jim and it definitely adds something that nobody knows my identity.'

At the start of this year, he decided to start selling greeting cards featuring the labrador image plus other photographs at £2 a pop and has sold 60,000 since January.

He now sells through over 200 outlets in Derbyshire. Prints of his work sell for around £40.

He said: 'It has been absolutely mad. And the thing is, it’s been so accidental and unforced, which is probably why it has caught so many people’s attention.

'Long may it continue - I’m having a brilliant time.'
