Ray, 56, plays Elzevir in Sky1’s Moonfleet, a two-part adaptation of John Meade Falkner’s tale of smuggling and adventure in the 18th century.

Here Ray, star of movies such as Scum and The Sweeney, takes us behind the scenes on the drama, filmed on location in Ireland.

MONDAYMuch of the drama in the first part of Moonfleet revolves around the battle between Elzevir and Mohune, played by Ben Chaplin, a magistrate determined to stamp out Elzevir’s smuggling in the Dorset village where the story is set. 

The scene we’re filming today involves quite a lot of running as Elzevir and his sidekick John Trenchard, played by Aneurin Barnard, attempt to escape the law. I’m not getting any younger, but I’m determined to carry on doing action sequences for as long as I can. I’ve earned my pint of Guinness at the end of the day… TUESDAYToday we’re at Coral Strand beach in Galway for a scene where John is emerging from the ocean, dripping wet and starkers. We’re all highly amused to find a busload of American tourists arriving to see this particularly beautiful beach, just as Aneurin leaves the sea totally naked! He’s a brave boy is Aneurin and he carries on regardless, finishing the scene like a pro. Once we’ve finished chuckling, there’s time to admire this spectacular coast which is like the Amalfi Coast in Italy – only colder. There are seals here too – what a fantastic place!

Today Elzevir is teaching John how to fire a flintlock pistol [right]. There’s quite a lot of shooting with flintlocks in Moonfleet, and they’re quite tricky to handle, so we’ve had lessons. I’m not bad but the miracles of the editing process may make Elzevir look a bit more proficient than I actually am...THURSDAYIn the second part of Moonfleet, Elzevir and John take to the high seas in pursuit of Blackbeard’s fabled diamond. We don’t actually get on board a ship – but it certainly feels like it! A large section of a sailing ship has been constructed and put on hydraulics in the car park of the old John Player cigarette factory in Dublin, where we’re being bombarded with gallons of water. It’s the nearest thing to being in a tempest without actually being at sea and it’s hard graft! We’re never sure where the boat’s going to shift next so those looks of fear and surprise on our faces are genuine.

FRIDAYWe’re completing our final scenes and I hope Moonfleet is the  kind of exciting, escapist drama people will want to watch as a family at this time of year. I’ve suffered a few bumps and bruises during filming but nothing that won’t heal. And I’m sure all the Guinness I’ve consumed has been good for me! We’re in Donacomper, County Kildare today – stunningly beautiful surroundings for a gruesome scene in which those who have caused Mohune great displeasure suffer a horrible punishment. What a lovely way to finish the job!Moonfleet, tonight and tomorrow, 8pm, Sky1.
