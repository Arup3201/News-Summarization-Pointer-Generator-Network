A group of British tourists who caused outrage in Rome when they were charged £54 for just four ice creams have received an apology from the Italian capital's mayor.

Roger and Wendy Bannister have also been invited back to the city by mayor Gianni Alemanno in an attempt to make off for their rip-off experience.

After they complained to an Italian newspaper about how they were treated at the cafe where they bought the ice cream, many Rome residents warned that the incident could damage the reputation of the city, one of the world's top tourist destinations.

Outraged: Holidaymakers Roger Bannister, his brother Steven and their wives Wendy and Joyce with the receipt for their ice cream

Mr and Mrs Bannister, along with Mr 
Bannister's brother Stephen and his wife Joyce, were handed the 
extortionate bill on Sunday, the last day of their holiday in Italy.

They had ordered three scoops of ice 
cream each to take away from the Antica Roma cafe near the Spanish 
Steps, and were charged €64 (£54) for their snacks.

Ripped off: The scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being 'ripped off' by local businesses

Mr Bannister, 58, today told BBC 
Breakfast of his shock at receiving the bill: 'It was just disbelief and
 then giving the money and having the change slapped down, the five euro
 note and the one euro coin, and then the receipt - 64 euros - we just 
walked out in disbelief.'

But after they went to a newspaper, 
he said, Mr Alemanno had got in contact offering 'sincere apologies' and
 saying he was 'very upset' about the incident.

Mr Bannister, from Stourbridge in the 
West Midlands, said the family had been told they would be treated to a 
free ice cream if they returned to Rome.

He earlier described how the group had been on a six-day trip to Rome, adding: 'Up until 
then we'd had a brilliant time, but that left a bad taste in the mouth –
 quite literally. To be honest the ice cream wasn't that nice either. 
We'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday.

'I felt I had been ripped off but what could I do?'

Matteo Costantini, a local councillor,
 said of the tourists' ordeal: 'They were justifiably outraged at what 
they had been asked to pay, and it should not be allowed. There needs to
 be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to 
unsuspecting tourists.

'It does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here.'

Mr Costantini added that he had 
personally offered to refund the money to the group but they had told 
him donate it to a charity.

The ice cream parlour in question gave
 a chilly response. A staff member who refused to give her name said: 
'The prices are clearly on display. They got what they asked for – four 
ice creams.'

She said the gelateria's most 
expensive cone is €25 (£21) and added: 'They got 16 euros' worth of
 ice cream each – almost a kilo. What more did they want?

'We get this all the time … but the 
prices are there in black and white. If they don't want the ice cream 
they can go somewhere else.'

Carlo Rienzi, president of Italy's 
Codacons consumer group, said it had officially requested 'an immediate 
investigation into this fraud'.
