A Malaysian woman who was allegedly enslaved for 30 years in south London after joining a Left-wing sect has been reunited with her older sister.

Aishah Wahab, 69, who disappeared in the early Seventies after becoming a member of a communist collective, walked free from a flat in Brixton earlier this month.

She finally met with retired teacher Kamar Mahtum, 73, last night after she flew into Heathrow two days ago.

Mrs Mahtum, who had hope to see her sister before she died, said the meeting was very emotional and 'revealing', according to The Daily Telegraph.

She also admitted that she could return to Malaysia with 'beautiful memories' of her sister and got the impression she also wanted to go home.

The retired teacher arrived at Heathrow on Wednesday with 30 documents proving she was the captive's sister.

She also brought a letter begging Aishah to return 'to the fold' and be a part of her life again.

In it, she wrote: 'Aishah we love you very much, we miss you and have been missing you desperately all these years.

'In our family's ups and downs in 
life, we always thought that it would have been a very great difference 
if you had been there.'

She added: 'All of us are waiting with love and hope. We love you Aishah.'

Meeting: Mrs Mautum, who flew into to Heathrow from Kuala Lumur, was carrying documents aiming to prove she was the alleged slave's sister

As she boarded a flight from Kuala 
Lumpur to London, she said: ‘I have felt so choked without her for years and 
years.

‘She was so talented; she was the apple of my mother’s eye. She asked for her on her deathbed.’

Miss Wahab is believed to have suffered a stroke while she was allegedly held captive by sect leaders Aravindan Balakrishnan and his partner Chanda, who were arrested in Brixton, South London last week.

Miss Wahab won a Commonwealth 
scholarship to study surveying in the UK and moved here in 1968 with her
fiance Omar Munir.

But she soon became involved in extremist politics 
and turned her back on her middle-class upbringing.

She is believed to have fallen under the spell of Aravindan Balakrishnan and his partner 
Chanda, who were last week arrested on suspicion of holding three women 
against their will for more than three decades in south London.

Attracted
to Balakrishnan’s group, Miss Wahab was so in awe of leader ‘Comrade 
Bala’ that she and Omar rowed over her ‘loyalty’ to him and eventually 
split, throwing her engagement ring in the Thames.
