Robin Thicke’s monster hit Blurred Lines has made a profit of more than $16 million since it became the biggest song of 2013, an L.A. court heard on Tuesday.

The song, also created to Pharrell Williams and T.I., is currently at the center of a legal battle over copyright infringement and the song’s alleged similarity to Marvin Gaye’s 1977 funk/disco classic Got To Give It Up.

The financial profitability of a song is typically a highly guarded secret and tends only to be revealed when the track is at the center of a $40 million lawsuit.

We're in the money: Robin Thicke’s monster hit Blurred Lines, which also featured Pharrell Williams and T.I. has made a profit of $16,675,690 since it became the biggest song of 2013, an L.A. court heard on Tuesday

According to  the federal copyright trial, the two sides have agreed on an exact figure of $16,675,690. That was divided with $5,658,214 going to Thicke, $5,153,457 to Williams, $704,774 to rapper T.I. and record companies pocketing the remainder. 

During opening arguments in the case, Richard Busch, the attorney representing Marvin Gaye's children Frankie and Nona Gaye had tallied the alleged damages at approximately $40 million.

Besides seeking profits — including a claimed $4 million from 50 percent of the publishing earnings of Blurred Lines — the Gayes are seeking damages for a reduction of the fair market value of the worth of licensing Got to Give It Up, reports The Hollywood Reporter.

The singer’s children Frankie and Nona Gaye are also targeting touring money too, with about $11 million attributable to the song's success.

Strangely, the Gayes filed the claim to counter a suit filed in August 2013 by Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on Gaye's copy written work.

Changing story: Robin claims now he only said that he was inspired by Marvin Gaye's song to make it sound like he was involved in writing his hit, when in fact Pharrell did (seen here with model Emily Ratajkowski)

The Gayes also claim that Thicke and his estranged wife Paula Patton's co-written track Love After War stole its sound from their father's song After the Dance. That song, according to more testimony brought home $895,374 in profits.

Earlier in the trail, Thicke had entertained the court when he danced and played keyboard from the witness stand to show that a number of pop songs have the same chord progression including U2's With Or Without You,‎ Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror and The Beatles' Let It Be.

According to court papers filed last year, Thicke said he was high on painkillers and alcohol when Blurred Lines became a hit, and he exaggerated his contribution to writing the song.

Thicke, 37, said in a deposition in April that he had been largely absent during the composition of Blurred Lines, due to being under the influence of opioid painkiller Vicodin mixed with alcohol.

'I had a drug and alcohol problem for the year and I didn't do a sober interview. So I don't recall many things that I said,' Thicke said in the deposition. He added that he was no longer taking Vicodin.

The song was created by R&B artist and producer Pharrell Williams, who said in deposition two days before Thicke's that he had composed the melody and written the lyrics for the hit, and that Thicke had 'embellished' the origins of the song.

The previously sealed depositions were filed in Los Angeles federal court in May in connection with a lawsuit by the estate of late soul singer Marvin Gaye against Thicke and Williams, accusing them of stealing from the Motown legend's 1977 song Got to Give it Up.
