Nato forces are successfully tracking Colonel Muammar Gaddafi from lair to lair around Libya, it has been revealed yesterday.

RAF Nimrod R1 spy planes, drones and the destroyer HMS Liverpool - stationed off the Libyan coast and packed with state-of-the-art eavesdropping equipment - are monitoring the desperate tyrant's movement, the Mail has learned.

The dictator has been 'racing from one place to another' over the past few weeks to avoid falling into enemy hands as his grip on his country loosens, said sources.

Nato commanders are not permitted to directly attack Gaddafi under the UN mandate which allows them to use military force to protect civilians.

Even if he is identified at a control or command centre - making him a legitimate bombing target - commanders are wary of launching a devastating strike for fear the cowardly Libyan leader is hiding behind a 'human shield' of innocent people.

But military chiefs are hoping the mounting pressure from wave after wave of airstrikes will cause his regime to 'implode' with close aides removing him.

Details of how closely Gaddafi was being watched by the coalition were disclosed by Whitehall sources as Nato marked 100 days of airstrikes.

Major General Nick Pope, the senior British military spokesman, said Nato carried out more than 12,000 flying sorties, including 5,000 attack missions, of which 2,400 had hit regime targets - suggesting a less than 50 per cent success rate.

However, the figures were later clarified by a NATO official: 'The figure of 5,000 relates to the number of fast jet aircraft that have taken off as part of the "protection of civilians" element the NATO mission being carried out under UNSCR 1973.

'The 2,500 figure occurs because targets are often struck by more than one aircraft, at other times aircraft may not release weapons at all. 

'It is important to remember that this mission is about the protection of civilians, and the real measure of success is the effect of our operation on Qadhafi’s forces, not the number of bombs dropped; and that success is borne out in towns like Ajdabiya and Misrata, who’s populations were being pounded daily by the regime, and who are now returning to some sort of normality.' 

But many missions were aborted in the final minuites to avoid hitting civilians.

RAF planes have twice pulled out of missions in recent days because of concerns innocent people might be endangered - precision-guided missiles were fired but diverted onto wasteland to avoid possible casualties.

On other occasions, RAF planes were sent on attack missions without specified targets - ordered to scour Libya from 30,000 feet in the hope of spotting regime tanks or rocket launchers.

Major General Pope said the British military had destroyed more than 500 targets, including 240 armoured vehicles or artillery installations and 150 buildings, including bunkers and ammunition stores.

The Ministry of Defence revealed yesterday that the UK's part in the Nato operation is costing taxpayers £43million per month.

British diplomats insisted it was a matter of 'when, not if' Gaddafi would be toppled.

A senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official claimed the momentum had 'shifted irrevocably' against the dictator and he was down to a 'handful' of followers.

In May alone around 150 senior officers defected from his Army, including five generals. Reports suggested Gaddafi had threatened to kill generals who failed to reclaim the rebel-held city of Misrata.

'The sands of time are running down for Gaddafi,' said the diplomatic source.

'Gaddafi's actions have stripped him of legitimacy. There can be no future for Libya with him in power.

'The anger against him is simmering. The question is not if he will go, but when.'

The diplomat spoke at the end of a troubling week for the coalition. Up to nine civilians were killed on Sunday after a Nato missile hit a home in Tripoli.

The tragedy prompted the Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini to demand a ceasefire.

The international criminal court is poised on Monday to issue arrest warrants on Gaddafi and two of his inner circle for war crimes.

Today, dozens of rebels previously detained in Tripoli were returned to their eastern stronghold on a Red Cross ship, and gave details of how they were tortured at the hands of government forces.

The ship carrying 51 prisoners also 
brought back 249 people  to Benghazi who wanted be reunited with family 
in eastern Libya, a Red Cross spokesman said. It was not immediately 
clear whether there had been a prisoner swap with the Gaddafi 
government.

'They electrocuted us, they tortured us in every possible way,' said Yousef al-Fetori, who had been detained in the capital.

'They broke my ribs, hand and leg.'

The Red Cross spokesman denied that there were any prisoners from Benghazi being swapped on board.

However, a spokesman for the rebels' transitional government said five prisoners had previously been sent back to Tripoli, though the rebels had not been aware the Red Cross was returning people to Benghazi.

Libyan rebels in the east say they are now in close contact with an underground network of opponents of Gaddafi in Tripoli.

A member of the rebels' National Transitional Council in rebel-held Benghazi revealed they were holding secret talks via Skype and satellite phone to prepare for the regime's fall.

Rising to the challenge: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged fellow Democrats to back the campaign to oust Gaddafi

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a rallying cry when she met with scores of House Democrats, urging them to vote against an impending measure to block funding for American operations in Libya.In emphatic language, Mrs. Clinton warned them a House resolution that would bar money for most military activities in Libya would be disastrous to American interests in that war-torn nation.'We have seen an international coalition come together unprecedented between not only Nato, but Arab nations, the Arab League, and the United Nations,' Mrs Clinton said.

'This is something that I don't think anyone could have predicted, but it is a very strong signal as to what the world expects to have happen, and I say with all respect that the Congress is certainly free to raise any questions or objections, and I'm sure I will hear that tomorrow when I testify.'But the bottom line is, whose side are you on? Are you on Gaddafi's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them? For the Obama Administration, the answer to that question is very easy.'
