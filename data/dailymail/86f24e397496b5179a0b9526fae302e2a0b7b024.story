An angler has broken the record for the biggest fish ever caught off British shores - and it weighs more than a gorilla.

The common skate fish, which was caught off the Isle of Skye, was so big that fisherman Daniel Bennett spent two hours struggling to reel it in.

When he finally got back to shore, the 26-year-old from Whitby, North Yorkshire, discovered his catch weighed 208lbs - more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped.

What a catch! Daniel Bennett, 26, caught this 208lb skate fish while fishing off the Isle
 of Skye - the biggest fish to be caught off British shores

The fish, a rare protected species similar to a stingray, was so large 
that the angler spent two hours reeling it in to shore, before tossing 
it back into the sea

Mr Bennett, who returned the fish back into the sea, said: 'The key to catching the fish was having a lot of 
patience. My back is absolutely killing me now though.

'We’ve never caught anything on that scale before, and we guessed it weighed about 150lb. But it was 208lbs. I can’t believe it.'

The fisherman caught the skate - a rare protected fish species that looks similar to a stingray - after it latched onto half a mackerel 
fillet that Mr Bennett had used as bait. 

Skates have a flat body and wing-like pectoral fins attached to their head, like a stingray.

There are dozens of species of skates but the common skate is the largest skate species.

A common skate can reach up to more than 8 ft (96 inches) in length and 220lbs - though most males grow to around 60 inches.

Skates,
 which have a life span of around 50 years, can live in most parts of 
the world - whether tropical seas or near-Arctic waters.

They are usually found in deep waters but can also survive in shallow waters.

The common skate is listed as a critically-endangered species. It is threatened both in the Atlantic 
Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.

Their eggs, so-called mermaid’s purses, are often found on beaches and are oblong and protected by leathery cases.

The catch, which was 88.25 inches long by 
66.75 inches wide, has now been confirmed by the British Record Fish Committee as the largest fish caught on its current list.

Although the fish was not weighed at the scene, because the anglers did not have scales, the weight was worked out by The Shark Trust - a UK conservation charity - based on the measurements of the fish.

Before that, the largest fish caught from British shores was a 159lb skate, which was reeled in on the Isle of Lewis in 1994.

Those anglers have since become 'local celebrities' on Skye - but Mr Bennett says his girlfriend, Philippa, is not quite as impressed.

Mr Bennett, who works in a fishing 
supplies shop, said: 'My partner is not really that interested, but 
she’s proud of me nonetheless.

'I think people outside the angling world 
find it harder to see how much of a feat this is.

'West Scotland is known for skate fishing but not Skye. We were the first to catch one there for at least 30 or 40 years.

'There
 was another chap in our group who caught one and it was about 120lb. We
 thought we’d never find one any bigger - then we did an hour later.'

The fish, which was 88.25inches long and 66.75inches wide, weighs more than a female gorilla, a heavyweight boxer or a moped and is the largest fish on record at the British Record Fish Committee

Nick Simmonds, secretary of the British Record Fish Committee, said: 'There is not a larger fish recorded as being caught on our current record list.

'Once we receive pictures from Dan we will pass them on to our scientist who will check the images and hopefully confirm the unofficial record.

'It can’t be confirmed as a record as it was not weighed at the scene.

'It will be seriously considered for the Notable Fish List, which was created for situations like this where the fish cannot be weighed. This list is historically important, at least in the angling world.'

The fish weighs more than a female Eastern Lowland gorilla

Here are some other things which weigh around the same amount as the skate fish caught by Mr Bennett.

That fish weighed 208lbs.

Fully-stocked fridge: 215lbs

Sir Steve Redgrave in his prime: 220lbs

Female Eastern Lowland gorilla: 200lbs

Vespa moped: 197lbs

Heavyweight boxer: over 200lbs
