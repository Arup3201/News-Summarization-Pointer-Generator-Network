David Cameron is planning to retaliate against the EU’s shock bill for £1.7billion – as even a French politician admitted the demand was ‘madness’.

The Prime Minister is said to be looking at ways to force Brussels to backtrack on the huge payment, which it wants by December.

Insiders say the ‘nuclear option’ would be to block key measures the eurozone countries need to strengthen their ailing economies.

Pierre Lellouche, a former trade minister under Nicolas Sarkozy, condemned the decision to levy the bill against the UK's growing economy, while France has seen unemployment soar

New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels

It came amid claims by a French former minister that the UK was being chastised for taking difficult measures to strengthen its economy – while other countries were being effectively rewarded for poor financial decisions.

Pierre Lellouche, who was trade minister under President Sarkozy, said: ‘I think it’s ludicrous to actually go punish the one country that has suffered the reform.’

Even though Britain is not part of the eurozone, our agreement is required for any rule change by members of the single currency bloc.

Experts said Mr Cameron could refuse to accede to calls by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker for eurozone regulations to be enshrined in EU treaties. Or he could decline to agree to tougher powers over member countries’ debt, tax and spending.

Last night a Number 10 spokesman said it was ‘premature’ to speculate on specific measures.

The Prime Minister said on Friday he would not pay the huge surcharge, saying it had not made it any easier to persuade the British people to stay in Europe. It emerged over the weekend, however, that he may agree to pay a lesser figure – as much as the low hundreds of millions.

The UK is being asked to pay around £1.7billion in part because its economy has performed better than expected over the past few years.

At a summit in Brussels on Friday, David Cameron made clear his anger to other EU leaders about the charge

Germany and France, whose economies have fared worse, will get rebates – with the French receiving £790million. 

The EU Commission President will this week walk away from his job with a pension worth more than £100,000 a year just days after he presented the UK with a shock £1.7billion bill.

Jose Manuel Barroso, 58, who retires on Friday after ten years in the role, will also receive a £20,000 lump sum, one month of his £240,000-a-year salary, plus a transitional allowance of between £290,000 and £473,000 over three years.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The British people are fed up with the greed and arrogance of unelected EU fat cats like Barroso.’

A spokesman for Mr Barroso, who is being succeeded by Jean-Claude Juncker, said: ‘The Commission does not set the terms of commissioners’ salaries and entitlements, the member states do.’

The European Commission is likely to throw out the French budget later this week over its failure to implement austerity regimes. Its economy is now one of the worst on the continent, sparking fears it could become the ‘new Greece’.

Mr Lellouche, who was part of the former centre-right government, said it was wrong for the UK to be targeted for its austerity programme.

He said: ‘The results are showing up now – the unemployment rate has gone down to half what it is in France; the growth rate is four times what it is in France – and we go and punish the British? It’s madness.

Calling the French economy ‘dead in the water’, he added: ‘And then we are going to reward the French socialists for having failed to fulfil their obligations – it’s crazy. I find it ironical that the French actually make money out of their failure.’

A spokesman for the French Institute of Enterprise told the BBC: ‘We are the sick man of Europe now. The future is Greece.

Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone warned Mr Cameron that he must not backtrack on his pledge not to pay the full £1.7billion bill.

‘The Prime Minister is right not to pay a penny to the European elite, which is completely out of touch,’ he said. ‘This is one of those times when he can’t back down.’

n One in five banks in the eurozone have still not learned the lessons of the financial crisis, it emerged yesterday. Some 24 out of 123 lenders failed ‘stress tests’ to see if they have raised enough capital to cushion against another meltdown.

Four UK banks including RBS and Lloyds were also tested by the European Banking Authority – and all passed. Tory MP Mark Garnier said it was further evidence that Britain led the way in tough banking reforms. 

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon used a series of media interviews to condemn the charge from Brussels, but admitted that a sum of 'tens of millions; could be paid
