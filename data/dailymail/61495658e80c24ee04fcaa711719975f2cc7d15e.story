Newcastle United are in desperate need of some attacking impetus right now - but midfielder Siem de Jong will not be returning to the side any time soon.

The £6million summer signing from Ajax posted a photograph on Instagram showing himself being propped up on crutches.

And the news that De Jong is still a long way from returning to the starting line-up will do little to lighten the mood on Tyneside, with the midfielder revealing: 'Still a couple of weeks to go on crutches :( #NUFC #injury.'

De Jong made just three appearances for the Magpies before he suffered a thigh injury which Newcastle revealed would rule him out for 'a number of months,' and he is not expected to return until after Christmas.

Alan Pardew's side are on a miserable run of form and sit second-bottom of the Premier League, having failed to win any of their first six matches this season.

The Magpies have lost 10 of their last 14 in the league, failing to score in 10 of those matches.

De Jong netted 57 times in 168 league games for Ajax and his potency from midfield has been sorely missed in Pardew's beleaguered side.

Newcastle travel to the Liberty Stadium to face fifth-placed Swansea City on Saturday.
