Jonny Brownlee had to settle for fifth place in the opening World Triathlon Series race of the season in Abu Dhabi.

The Olympic bronze medallist paid the price for slipping towards the back of a large leading pack at the end of the bike leg and was unable to close the gap to leading trio Mario Mola, Vincent Luis and Richard Murray on the run.

Brownlee then lost out in a sprint finish to Joao Silva of Portugal but did at least have the consolation of beating great rival Javier Gomez, who could only manage sixth.

Gomez's Spanish compatriot Mola was the class of the field over the sprint distance and pulled away during the second half of the five kilometres run to clinch a comfortable victory.

Jonny's brother Alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but, with Olympic qualification to be decided in August and September at the test event in Rio and the world series Grand Final in Chicago, none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon.

Jonny, 24, said: 'I wanted better than that. I messed up everything I possibly could. That's what the first race is about.

'I thought my running was going well, but obviously not so well off the bike. I got into it later on but it was too late then. I just need to iron out the mistakes and sharpen up a little.'

The women's race was once again dominated by world champion Gwen Jorgensen of the United States, with a disappointed Jodie Stimpson the leading British athlete in 17th.

Stimpson, who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last year, missed the front bike pack and was unable to make up any ground on the run, with a niggling Achilles problem not helping.

Britain's former world champions Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins along with Commonwealth bronze medallist Vicky Holland all chose to stay at home and continue their training.

The next round of the series takes place in Auckland at the end of March.
