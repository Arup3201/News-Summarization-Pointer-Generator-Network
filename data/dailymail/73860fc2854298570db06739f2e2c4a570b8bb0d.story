Illegal immigrants in the U.S. are being sent home in record numbers, with those who pose a public safety risk or national security threat being deported first, the homeland security secretary said last night.

Janet Napolitano defended the Obama administration's new policy of deciding which illegal immigrants to remove from the country first.

The government is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants, she said.

The new priority system is a shift from the Bush administration's enforcement strategy, Mrs Napolitano said in a speech at American University in Washington, D.C.

Republicans say making it a priority to deport those immigrants amounts to a back-door way of granting amnesty to other people who are living in the U.S. illegally but haven't committed crimes.

Yet to immigration advocates, the administration is still deporting such illegal immigrants. 

Mrs Napolitano said policies inherited from the Bush administration 'allowed as many resources, if not more, to be spent tracking down and deporting the college student as were spent on apprehending criminal aliens and gang members.'

Authorities would conduct large raids at companies without consistently punishing the employer or targeting individuals who posed a threat.

'Public safety wasn't enhanced by 
these raids, and they sometimes required hundreds of agents and 
thousands of hours to complete,' she said.

Now,
she said, the Department of Homeland Security is using fingerprints 
collected from those held in local jails to identify and deport 
criminals and repeat immigration violators.

illegal immigrants in the US and numbered 6.5million, or 58 per cent of 
the total across the nation, in 2010

Advocates for an immigration overhaul say this program, known as Secure Communities, has resulted in the deportation of people accused of traffic violations or other similarly low-level offences.

Several states have said they don't want to participate, arguing that immigration is a federal, not state, responsibility. 

Mrs Napolitano denied that the program had led to more annual deportations and didn't give police immigration authority.

She did acknowledge missteps. For example, participation at first was thought to be voluntary, but department officials later made it mandatory.

Under fire: Republicans have criticised the Obama administration's overall approach to enforcement

She said: 'But as flawed as the beginnings of this program were, it has already helped accomplish a great deal toward ensuring that we use our enforcement resources where they do the most good.'

She also said the administration was committed to comprehensive immigration changes.

Congressional Republicans have said the government must first secure the border before discussions can turn to an overhaul and have criticised the Obama administration's overall approach to enforcement.

Neither side was satisfied with yesterday's speech.

Republican Lamar Smith of Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the administration's immigration policies don't make sense.

'There is nothing smart about it - seven million illegal immigrants work in the U.S. while 14million Americans are unemployed,' he said in a statement.

'Work site enforcement activities are down 70 per cent. The Obama administration has abandoned work site enforcement, allowing illegal workers to take jobs that should go to American workers.'

Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-immigrant National Immigration Forum, said the government needs to move faster in fulfilling promises to target criminals and others who pose a safety threat.

He said: 'Fast, sound implementation of the department's deportation prioritisation is needed now. In this time of scarce dollars and budget crisis, our government should not waste billions on haphazard and unfocused enforcement.'

Homeland Security officials have been promoting the criminal targeting effort since Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials announced the arrests of nearly 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants in week-long, nationwide sweep last week. Those people will now face deportation proceedings.
