An Enfield property has a surprising link to Henry VIII, played in the BBC series Wolf Hall by Damian Lewis, pictured

The Tudor Room inside Little Park has played host to more than its fair share of royal history, and was the place where Henry VIII’s children – Elizabeth, Mary and Edward – were summoned to be told that the King was dead.

Each of them went on to rule England as Elizabeth I, Edward VI and Mary. 

And in the 1920s, Mary’s namesake – our current Queen’s grandmother – was also a regular visitor to the house and Tudor Room: in her case to discuss antiques with the Leggatt brothers, the art and antiques dealers who owned the house until the 1950s. 

Bizarrely, the room has not always been on its present site – tacked on to Little Park, which is a delightful six-bedroom house in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court, an Edwardian snooker room, outdoor pool and gym, all tucked away in a conservation area a short walk from the bustle of Enfield town centre in suburban North London. 

Where the room stood originally remains a mystery, but historians believe it was once part of Elsyng, a 14th Century manor house nearby, which Henry had appropriated from its owner in 1539. 

And after Elsyng, the room was moved to Enfield Manor House, which came to be known as Enfield Palace and on whose site now stands the town’s department store, Pearsons.

Rich heritage: The Tudor Room in Little Park was where Henry VIII’s children – Elizabeth, Mary and Edward – were summoned to be told that the King was dead

It is believed it was Elizabeth, who was gifted Elsyng and the manor house, who moved the spectacular Tudor relics, dark wood-panelled walls, elaborate fireplaces and friezes from Elsyng to the manor house, which, in 1918, the Leggatt brothers bought and tried in vain to sell to the National Trust, before it was bought by the department store.

To preserve the ancient treasures – which include a stained-glass window featuring Philip II of Spain, Queen Mary’s husband – in 1928 the Leggatts moved the room once more, to Little Park, which has been owned for the past 12 years by Adrian and Anne Birchall, who are now selling for £2.8 million.

‘The original part of the house was built in 1530, but the facade is Edwardian and it was then that the snooker room was built,’ says Adrian, a former chairman of Mediavest, one of the biggest advertising buying agencies in the world.

Spacious: The house is in an acre of tranquil grounds with a tennis court, an Edwardian snooker room, outdoor pool and gym. Pictured, the garden with its weathervale

A stone plaque records Queen Mary’s visits to the Leggatt brothers in the 1920s – she was cataloguing all the Royal possessions. 

For all its historic treasures and connections, Little Park today has all the trappings a modern family would need. 

The kitchen/morning room, with its conservatory, is a vast, light room with wonderful views of the walled back garden.

Price £2.8 million

Location Enfield, North London

Bedrooms Six

Unique features 

Historic Tudor Room (that has been moved TWICE), snooker room, outdoor swimming pool, gym, tennis court 

Four of the bedrooms are en suite, there is plenty of off-street parking, and the whole house, which is immaculately decorated and maintained, is virtually invisible from the outside world. 

The gardens are a particular feature, and include a historic treasure: the weathervane from Theobalds House, the country seat of King James I, which was demolished in 1650.

‘You can sit in the garden on a nice day and you could be anywhere,’ says Anne, a pharmacist. ‘You don’t even hear traffic.’

Nick Staton, whose estate agency is selling Little Park, says: ‘When I first went inside the house, I was blown away. This will appeal to a traditional buyer who wants a Rembrandt rather than a Picasso.’

The couple, who have recently become grandparents, are downsizing but plan to stay in the area to be close to their daughter.
