Four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson fears for the future of athletics.

Johnson believes the sport is in a poor state of health and feels it has become over-dependent on its status within the Olympics for its well-being.

The American, who famously won 200 and 400-metre titles at Atlanta in 1996 as well as two other golds, wants to see changes made to the structure and marketing of track and field.

The 46-year-old, speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, said: 'There is certainly a real issue with athletics as a sport and there has been for some time now.

Concerned: Athletics legend Michael Johnson is worried for the future of the sport 

'It is fortunate and unfortunate that athletics is still the premier sport of the Olympics, because I think that tends to allow the powers that be to sit back and be a little bit more relaxed than they probably should.

'I am not sure athletics would still be around if it didn’t have that status as a premier Olympic sport.”

Johnson wants to see a balance struck between protecting the traditions of the sport and improving its promotion.

The American’s comments echo similar remarks made recently by Great Britain’s Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford.

Johnson said: 'There is certainly some tradition and historic value to athletics as a sport, but there has been a real reluctance to make any significant change from a marketing standpoint.

'We are not drawing in new fans, whereas in soccer, in comparison, there is a tremendous amount of new fans in the US.

Dependence: Johnson, speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in Manchester, reckons athletics relies too much on its status within the Olympics 

'Athletics we are not doing anything to draw in new fans because there hasn’t been any changes. I am not sure where it’s going and I am not sure quite what will happen.

'Unless there is significant change in the structure of the sport it will be difficult, but the sport is three, if not four sports, wrapped into one and that makes it difficult.'

Johnson was speaking at the football-themed conference in his capacity as founder of Michael Johnson Performance, an organisation which aspires to help athletes of all sports reach their full potential.
