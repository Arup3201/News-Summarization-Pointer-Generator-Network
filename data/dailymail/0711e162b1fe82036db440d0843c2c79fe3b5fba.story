This is the terrifying moment when two window cleaners were left stranded 144 metres above the ground when the platform they were working on stalled and slipped nearly 90 degrees.

The cradle could be seen dangling on an angle from the 48th floor of DC Tower 1 in Vienna, Austria - the country's tallest skyscraper.

It is not known how long the pair were left suspended on the side of the 250-metre high building before being rescued by firefighters.

They both walked away from the ordeal unhurt.

The pair were working on DC Tower 1, also known as Donau City Tower 1, which is in Vienna's Donau City - a new urban residential and business centre in the city.

A close-up photo of the platform appears to show as one of the workers, dressed in a bright jacket, was holding on to the raised edge of the platform.

The 60-floor building was completed late last year and construction is underway on a second tower, DC Tower 2, which will be built nearby the first building.

The striking skyscraper has a distinctive design, with the glass windows on one side cut to look like waves.

Most of the available floor space will be used for offices, with American health care company Baxter International has been confirmed as one of the largest tenants at DC Towers.

The upper floors have the option of being used for luxury apartments, while the first 15 floors will house a four-star hotel operated by the Spanish Sol Meliá Group.

There will also be a restaurant in one of the top floors. As of June 2012 tenants have been confirmed for 50 percent of the floor space according to the owner WED (Wiener Entwicklungsgesellschaft für den Donauraum).
