It’s the posing craze sweeping the U.S. after being brought to fame by skier Lindsey Vonn, soccer star Omar Cummings, baseball player Albert Pujols - and even Republican politician Rick Perry.

But now four students at Riverhead High School on Long Island, New York, have been suspended for dropping to a knee and taking up a prayer pose to mimic Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.

Jordan Fulcoly, Wayne Drexel, Tyler Carroll and Connor Carroll were all suspended for one day because the ‘Tebowing’ craze was blocking the hallway and presenting a safety hazard to students.

Issue: Four of the pupils were suspended for one day because they allegedly did not heed to warnings that the 'Tebowing' craze at the school was blocking the hallway and presenting a safety hazard to students

‘It was basically just a tribute to Tim Tebow,’ Connor, 17, told the New York Post. ‘I just don’t think it’s fair (to suspend us). It was more than a religious thing - it was basically like a moment of silence.’

Around 40 students at Riverhead had been imitating the star quarterback in the school corridors, but school officials said this was delaying students on their way to lessons and presenting a fire hazard.

‘It’s wonderful that our students look up to sports heroes such as Mr Tebow, but we can’t allow students to create unsafe situations in school,’ Superintendent Nancy Carney told Riverhead Patch.

Two of the four suspensions were later rescinded because school officials decided those pupils had not been given the same warnings as the other two, reported ESPN New York.

‘It causes a potentially unsafe situation with 1,500 people in the building,’ Principal David Wicks told Newsday, saying if a fire alarm went off ‘they could potentially stop someone from getting to safety’.

Ms Carney has been receiving ‘hate mail’ since the incident from people who believe ‘Tebowing’ was banned by Principal Wicks for religious discrimination, which was ‘very unsettling’ for her.

‘It's a shame that people out there are so ready to judge when they weren't there to see what happened,’ she told ESPN New York.

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said at the GOP debate on Thursday night that he wants to make a comeback of his own, stating: ‘I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses’.

Superintendent Nancy Carney

Recently-divorced skier Vonn, 27, last week joined the craze that mimics Tebow of NFL team Denver Broncos - and she had asked his brother beforehand if it would be OK to pull off the pose if she won.

Before stepping on the top step of the podium at the post-race ceremony to celebrate her 46th World Cup win, she dropped to a knee with her skis in her hand and pulled a ‘Tebow’ move.

Out of respect for Tebow she asked his brother, who was at the race, if it would be disrespectful, and he gave her the green light to do it. The two have recently struck up a friendship but deny dating.
