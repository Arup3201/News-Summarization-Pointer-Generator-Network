Barcelona pass master Xavi admits being frustrated by his lack of playing time this season, but he is determined to fight his way into Luis Enrique's plans.

The 34-year-old was linked with a summer move to Qatar or the United States before deciding to stay at the Nou Camp where he has been an integral part of an all conquering team - winning seven La Liga titles and three Champions League titles during his career.

The veteran midfielder has only started a single league game this season, but insists he is happy at the club and respects his manager's decisions during what is a transitional season.

Speaking at a promotional event for adidas, he said: 'I want to play as much as possible and change my situation, but the team comes first and it's the coach who decides.

'It's been a hectic month and I'm going to fight in order to continue to be an important part of this team. I'm not happy to sit on the bench.

'Now it's down to me to cope and enjoy the playing time that I get. It isn't a dramatic situation for me and I'm trying to turn it around so that I feel more useful. I'm happy that I stayed at Barca.'

The Spain international accepted he is not guaranteed a starting place but is not considering alternatives beyond this season.

'I didn't make any prior agreements with Luis Enrique regarding my role,' he added. 'I'm not thinking about anything else. I don't have any targets.

'I just want to enjoy what comes and hope the team continue to win.'
