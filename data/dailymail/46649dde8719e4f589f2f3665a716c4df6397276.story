The number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has soared in the last few years, according to an official report.

The number of calls to poison centres in the U.S. relating to the liquids in e-cigarettes has risen from one per month in September 2010, to 215 per month in February 2014.

The figures, from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, also show that the number of calls per month relating to conventional cigarettes did not increase in the same way.

The number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has rocketed in the last four years, figures show

The CDC statistics show that more than half of the calls relate to children under the age of five.

However, some 42 per cent are related to adults over the age of 20.

As e-cigarettes become more popular, they are linked to more poisoning cases.

The analysis compared total monthly poison centre calls involving e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes, and found the proportion of e-cigarette calls jumped from 0.3 per cent in September 2010 to 41.7 per cent in February 2014. 

Poisoning from conventional cigarettes is generally due to young children eating them.

Poisoning related to e-cigarettes involves the liquid containing nicotine used in the devices. It can occur in three ways - by ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin or eyes.

‘This report raises another red flag about e-cigarettes – the liquid nicotine used in e-cigarettes can be hazardous,’ said CDC Director Tom Frieden.

E-cigarettes are now responsible for 42 per cent of all poisoning cases related to cigarettes

‘Use of these products is skyrocketing and these poisonings will continue. 

‘E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavours that are appealing to children.’

E-cigarette calls were more likely than cigarette calls to include a report of an adverse health effect following exposure.

The most common adverse health effects mentioned in e-cigarette calls were vomiting, nausea and eye irritation.

The data for the study came from the poison centres that serve the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories.

Poison centres reported 2,405 e-cigarette and 16,248 cigarette exposure calls from September 2010 to February 2014.

The total number of poisoning cases is likely higher than reflected in this study, because not all exposures might have been reported to poison centres.

‘The most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey showed e-cigarette use is growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related poisonings are also increasing rapidly,’ said Tim McAfee, Director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. 

‘Health care providers, e-cigarette companies and distributors, and the general public need to be aware of this potential health risk from e-cigarettes.’

The news comes just days after it was announced that the Welsh government will consider including e-cigarettes under the smoking ban.

Ministers say they might ban smoking the electronic devices inside because they could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes.

Currently, there are no plans to ban them in England, but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety.

Earlier this week it was announced that the Welsh government is considering extending the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes.

This would mean people were not allowed to smoke the electronic devices inside.

Ministers say they have made the proposal because they fear e-cigarettes could glamourize smoking and act as a gateway to normal cigarettes.

Mark Drakeford, health minister in the Labour-run Welsh government, said people have spent 30 years creating a climate in which people understand smoking is not glamorous but he is concerned e-cigarettes could undo that good work.

There are currently no plans to ban them in England but the chief medical officer has raised concerns about their safety.

Dame Sally Davies said: 'We are normalising e-cigarettes. If they were regulated as a medicine and we knew what was in them and the dose of nicotine, then they might play a useful role in stopping smoking. But they aren't, so at the moment we don't know their safety or the dose they deliver.

'Flavourings are often attractive to children – cookies and cream and bubblegum.

'They are sold rather cheaply and many are made in China, so I worry about what's in them.

'I am also worried about once again making smoking seem like a normal activity.'
