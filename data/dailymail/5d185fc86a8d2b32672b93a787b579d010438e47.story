Thousands of Roma could claim compensation after a list made by police in Sweden was deemed to have breached their human rights.

Skane County police said they compiled the list of 4,700 names because it 'helped them tackle crime'.

However a commission has ruled that the list was prejudicial as it lead to Roma being watched who hadn't done anything wrong.

The list, which the commission said was the result of several years work, contained the names of 200 dead people, alongside children's names and those of distant relations of Roma living in Sweden.

Skane police could now be in for a bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds following the decision by the Commission on Security and Integrity Protection as every one of the 4,500 living people named are entitled to compensation.

Skane County police has claimed the list was assembled to 'fight a criminal network rather than to keep tabs on people of a specific ethnicity.'

However the ruling found that there was 'no clear reason' for the list, adding: 'An undefined purpose gives no framework to the personal data, which in practice undermines the protection of individuals' integrity.'

Sweden's national police commissioner Bengt Svenson said: 'I hope and pray to god that this is the only registry of this kind. It's upsetting. This is completely unacceptable and I cannot understand the purpose of it.'

The news comes just a week after European human rights campaigners warned that media coverage of missing girls discovered with Roma families risked perpetuating 'age old myths' about the travelling people.

The case of Maria, a blonde girl found living with Roma in Greece, stunned the nation after she was found to belong to a Bulgarian family leading to allegations of kidnap.

Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, said: 'Most news reports, not only in Europe but all over the world, have insisted on the ethnicity of the families from which the children have been taken, thus propagating age-old myths portraying Roma as child-abductors.'

Meanwhile Britain is preparing to open its doors to thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants from 2014 as part of EU free-movement agreements.

While Roma make up only a small percentage of the population of Romania, some have expressed fears that a disproportionately high number will come because a large number of them live in poverty.

Just last week David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, warned that his constituency of Sheffield could face race riots if the migrants arrive in large numbers.

He called on Roma people to 'change their culture' and send their children to school to assuage 'understandable tensions' in the area.
