There’s nothing better than a long walk on the beach to clear your mind knowing that you’ve made an unhinged communist dictator your personal enemy.

That is, at least, what actor Seth Rogen may have been thinking Sunday when he headed for the shores of Malibu, California, with his wife, Lauren Miller, and their rescue puppy, Zelda.

The couple were photographed strolling barefoot in the surf, with both Rogen and his better half wearing dark sunglasses despite the overcast skies.

Life's a beach: Actor and funnyman Seth Rogen takes a walk on the shores of Malibu, California, with his wife, Lauren Miller, Sunday as the scandal surrounding his film The Interview continued to unfold 

Putting on a brave face: The comedian flashed a faint smile and a thumbs-up sign while strolling on the shore

Man's best friend: Rogen was accompanied by his loyal four-legged companion, Zelda the dog 

Staying hydrated: The actor was photographed carrying an orange can of soda

Brief respite: Rogen appeared in good spirits while chatting with his better half 

Rogen, 32, found himself at the center of a firestorm after Sony Pictures pulled the plug on the theatrical release of his latest comedy, The Interview, co-written with James Franco, in response to threats made by hackers reportedly linked to North Korea.

The actor appeared to keep his emotions in check Sunday while walking on the beach in a pair of dark-blue shorts and a zip-up hooded sweatshirt, a can of soda in his hands.

At one point, Rogen even flashed a thumbs-up sign for the paparazzi, the faintest shadow of a smile playing on his lips.

Rogen and Miller appeared to be alone on the beach Sunday, with not a bodyguard in sight.

By contrast, last week his co-star and co-creator of The Interview James Franco, 36, stepped out of his New York City apartment building accompanied by an imposing security guard.  

It has been reported that Rogen felt ‘betrayed’ by Sony executives for cancelling the Christmas Day premiere of his film after hackers with the shadowy Guardians of Peace organization threatened to stage ‘9/11-style’ attacks on cinemas that show the comedy about a fake CIA-backed assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. 

In Late November, Sony had its systems breached by hackers, resulting in the release of a decade’s worth of emails and other private information, including employees’ social security numbers and salary figures.

Keeping a low profile: Even though the day was grey and cloudy, both Rogen and his wife kept their dark sunglasses on, and Lauren Miller also donned a straw hat 

Mum: Rogen has not spoken publicly about Sony Pictures' controversial decision to pull the plug on his and pal James Franco's film 

What lies beneath: The bearded comedian reportedly feels 'betrayed' by the studio's move to cancel the release of The Interview 

Far from it all: The actor appeared relaxed and unfazed by the disconcerting news that North Korea has threatened to blow up the White House in the aftermath of The Interview scandal   

On their own: Rogen and Miller walked on the beach with no bodyguards in sight Sunday 

Rogen's film may yet reach the masses after Sony announced plans to release The interview for free online

Last week, the federal government announced they have evidence that the Kim Jong-Un’s totalitarian regime was behind the Sony breach – a claim Pyongyang has vehemently denied, instead pointing a figure of blame at the Obama administration.

The New York Post recently reported that Sony is planning to release Rogen and Franco’s R-rated spy spoof free of charge on its own streaming service, Crackle.

During his end-of-the year press conference Friday, President Obama said Sony made a mistake by pulling the plug on rogen's film in response to the hackers' demands.

Sony CEO Michale Lynton responded to Obama's criticism by insisting that the studio did not cave in, and that it was committed to making the movie available for public viewing.

Out and about: Rogen's co-star Randall Park, who played King Jong-Un in the shelved comedy, stepped out with his young family Saturday without bodyguards  

Shelved: In this December 17 photo, a poster for the movie The Interview is carried away by a worker after being pulled from a display case at a Carmike Cinemas movie theater in Atlanta

Under fire: Obama declared Friday that Sony 'made a mistake' in shelving the satirical film, "The Interview," about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader

'Dear leader': Kim Jong-Un's regime has threatened to blow up the White House in the wake of the hack on Sony

Just this weekend, North Korea threatened more attacks against the US government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Sony which cancelled the release of The Interview.

In a ranting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Korean authorities hit back in an escalating war of words in which they say they will 'blow up' the White House - while bizarrely continuing to deny they have anything to do with the cyber attacks on Sony.

North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from. 

Obama also announced from his Hawaii retreat there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism.
