On December 10, Toshiba's REGZA 553X is also capable of '4K' resolutions - four times current hi-def sets.

Sadly, the price should ensure the 'naked eye' 3D set doesn't hit the mainstream straight away - it will be £7,400, and only available in Japan. It will launch in the UK early next year, price to be confirmed.

It could mark a revolution in 3D televisions - consumers are still lukewarm about the technology, and most surveys indicate that the problem is that people aren't comfortable wearing glasses.

Toshiba's 'naked eye' 3D set will be 55 inches, and capable of '4K' resolutions - a super-hi-def format four times the resolutions of current HD sets

Unlike previous 'glasses-free' technologies, Toshiba's uses a 'face tracking' system so that each person sees 'perfect' 3D.

Earlier 'glasses free' sets, such as ones pioneered by Philips, required you to be sat precisely in front of them to see 3D rather than a weird blur - and even then the effect was jarring and artificial.

Toshiba's technology uses high-powered computers in the 'back' of the television to 'aim' separate beams of parallax 3D at each viewer.

'The glasses-free 3D technology is based on the stereoscopic principle of simultaneously delivering a picture for the left eye, and another one with a small offset (parallax), for the right eye to achieve the 3D effect,' says the company.

'To deliver a glasses-free 3D image and experience, a range of lenticular lenslets guide the dedicated images to each viewer.The ZL2 is able to provide 3D images for up to nine different viewing positions, enabling multiple people to enjoy simultaneous 3D viewing, with no glasses required.'

The 'lenslets' are tiny lenses that 'focus' the image towards each viewers, using 'face tracking' to ensure each person sees a correct left eye and right eye image.

Early tech demos have been highly impressive - and Toshiba is well ahead of rival TV companies in 'naked eye' 3D. Most sets from rivals such as LG are around 25 inches.

'In addition, to tailor the viewing experience to the viewers’ actual positions in front of the TV, the 55ZL2 features face tracking technology. At the touch of a button, it is able to detect the viewers’ position and to adjust the viewing zones accordingly by moving the lenslets as required.'

Companies such as Sony are already shooting films in 4K - a super-high-def resolution touted as the 'next generation' of high definition.
 Toshiba's set is the first consumer TV with the technology - although 
there are no video players on the market capable of showing anything in 
4K, or even any discs stored in the format.

The TV can also 'upscale' any 2D content into 3D - although it remains to be seen how convincing this function is. Other televisions' attempts to 'upscale' into 3D have looked unconvincing.
