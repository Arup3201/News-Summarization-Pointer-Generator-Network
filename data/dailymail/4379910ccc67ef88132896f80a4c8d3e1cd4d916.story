Police have not opened a kidnapping investigation into Robert Allenby's case despite his claims, while authorities also have a surveillance video of a man on a $10,000 spending spree with Allenby's stolen credit card in Waikiki, Hawaii.

9 News reported on Thursday that Hawaii News Now investigative reporter Keoki Kerr said police have not opened a kidnapping investigation, only a robbery case and an unauthorised use of credit card case. However, he said that police believed there was not even sufficient evidence to pursue the robbery case.

‘The investigation is still ongoing but we have opened a robbery and fraudulent theft and credit card investigation. That is all,’ Michelle Yu of the Honolulu Police Department told Daily Mail Australia. 

Mr Kerr claimed that the same man was also caught on surveillance camera going around stores using Allenby's credit cards to buy more than $10,000 worth of merchandise.

Toa Kaili claims that he found Robert Allenby passed out on the pavement before he and a friend woke the golfer who accused them of stealing his wallet and phone

Allenby says he can't recall two and a half hours after he was abducted, robbed and dumped in a park

'The one thing police are certain of is that somebody was using his credit cards and wasn't authorised to do so. That's why they're pursuing that credit card case,' Mr Kerr said.

He also said authorities did not believe Allenby's wounds were consistent with an assault, and that it looked like a scrape suffered from a fall.  

Mr Kerr made it clear that kidnapping is very rare in Hawaii as it has a very low violent crime rate, and that kidnapping usually involves people who know each other. 

'It's usually a husband and wife, a girlfriend and boyfriend, or a drug dealer and someone who owes him money,' he explained to 9 News.

'It almost never happens in the case of someone who is just trying to steal some money, credit cards or an iPhone from a tourist. That would be a lot of effort to go through.' 

Mr Kerr reiterated that there was still no evidence that Mr Allenby was lying, but that 'there's a healthy scepticism about parts of his story'. 

Since the Australian golfer claimed he was knocked unconscious, placed in a boot and dumped 10km from his hotel after missing the cut at the Sony Open on Saturday, holes have appeared in his story. 

In yet another twist to the mystery, a homeless man has also come forward claiming he knows where Robert Allenby was for the two and a half hours that the golfer says he can't recall following his alleged abduction. 

Toa Kaili says he stumbled across the pro golfer passed out on a sidewalk in Waikiki, in Hawaii, at 11pm on Saturday and when he and his friend tried to help Allenby he accused them of stealing his wallet and phone. 

About two hours later, Mr Kaili says he returned  to find the golfer still unconscious on the pavement but now with a bloodied face – the man claims the Australian was injured from falling over and hitting his head on a rock.

'Then he’s accusing me and my friend 'you guys stole my wallet and phone – alright the gig is up just hand it over' so I was like 'brother we are the ones who woke you up - we are the ones just helping you,' Mr Kaili told Channel 9 News.

'He was saying 'you don’t know who I am'.' 

Although Mr Kaili denies stealing Allenby's possessions - someone has been having a fine time with the golfer's credit card.

Honolulu detectives are following the spending spree on Robert Allenby's stolen credit card, as they try to solve the mystery surrounding his alleged abduction last week.

Investigators have also been door-knocking businesses throughout the city for video surveillance footage that might help them piece together what happened to the Australian golfer on the night he was bashed and robbed.

Four days have passed since Robert Allenby's attack. As yet local police have made no arrests and are still seeking more surveillance video to help with their investigation. Authorities believe the spending spree on his stolen credit card is their best chance of an arrest

An emotional reunion. Robert Allenby meets the homeless woman, now identified as Charade Keane, at the park in Honolulu where she came to his aid at the weekend

'Thank you for looking after me,' Allenby said to Ms Keane when they were reunited

'It’s such a shame that people are focusing on whether the story is true,' Robert Allenby is believed to have said in text messages to the Golf Channel. 'I say you only have to look at me to see the truth.'

'Detectives are reviewing witness statements and gathering security video footage,' Yu said.

'They are also looking into recent charges made on Mr Allenby’s credit card. No arrest has been made.' 

But other CCTV is being sought from the strip around the wine bar where Allenby was last seen. 

'The (extra) video will be very helpful,' Honolulu Police Department Captain Rade Vanic said.

Staff at the wine bar in which Allenby, 43, was last seen at about 11pm on Friday said 'we can't say anything about that', when contacted by Daily Mail Australia and asked if they had seen anything untoward on the night.

With varying stories from Allenby and Charade Keane, the woman who helped the dazed and bruised Australian in the early hours on Saturday morning, detectives are trying to reconstruct the incident.

They are believed to be already in possession of vision which shows Allenby leaving the Amuse Wine Bar at about 11pm on the Friday, with two, as yet unidentified men, and a woman. And more CCTV footage of two men buying alcohol, apparently with the golfer's credit card, has been taken from a store at Waikiki. 

Ms Keane 'dragged' Allenby to safety as he was arguing with two men in the park telling him 'you have to leave or they will kill you'

Allenby said he couldn't remember much in the hours after being assaulted and robbed.

Capt Vanic said not only were detectives attempting to find more surveillance footage of what Allenby described as a Hollywood-style attack and kidnapping, but they were now seeking video from stores where the culprits might have used his stolen credit cards.

Police said they could publicly release video of suspects in the hope of identifying the thieves. 

'We do have video from various retail establishments, so we are looking into it,' Capt Vanic said.

'Of course, if it does show individuals who are possible suspects, we will do our best to identify them and may even put it out with our Crime Stoppers information.

'But it is still very early on in our investigation.'

Capt Vanic said Keane gave police a statement and they would interview her again if needed.

Allenby was drinking with friends at the upmarket Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night and believed he was drugged, bashed in the face with a fist or baseball bat, tossed in the boot of a car, robbed and then dumped in a park 10 kilometres away.

The drama began when Allenby was separated from his friends in the bar, caddie Mick Middlemo and Anthony Puntoriero.

The confusion over what happened to Robert Allenby includes his belief that he was found two and a half hours after he left his friends and some 10 kilometres away from where he was dining and Charade Keane's claim that it was just 50 metres from the Amuse Wine Bar

'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said.

'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away.

'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car.

'That is where I got the scrapes above my eye, from the side-walk.' 

The homeless woman he referred to is believed to be Ms Keane, who said she found and helped Allenby a short distance away from the bar, perhaps 50 metres down the road, at about 1.30am - some two and a half hours after he disappeared. 

Bizarrely Allenby had an emotional reunion with the homeless woman, just hours after he accused her of being paid to spread false stories about what happened that night. 

Allenby, whose face was badly cut and bruised, announced on Tuesday he would not play in this week's PGA Humana Challenge event in La Quinta, California, on the advice of his doctor. 'This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour,' he added

The golfer embraced and kissed Ms Keane, as they greeted each other back at the spot where she said they first met, across the road from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Saturday morning.

'I really appreciate what you did,' Allenby told her.

The reunion came a few hours after the multi-millionaire pro-golfer reportedly speculated in text messages to Golf Central that Keane was was 'getting paid' to relay details of the incident to the media.
