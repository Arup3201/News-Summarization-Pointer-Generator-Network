A jam maker in a rural Romanian village is charging £300 a jar for her produce after Prince Charles gave it the royal seal of approval on a recent visit. 

Gerda Gerghiceanu, 63, lives in Viscri, where Charles owns a 18th Century Saxon home.

After impressing the the heir to the throne, who accepted a free jar, she has upped the price because of a huge increase in demand for her preserve.

Gerda Gerghiceanu, from the Romanian village of Viscri where Prince Charles owns a home, is selling jars for £300 after Prince Charles gave her produce the royal seal of approval

Jam fit for a King: Prince Charles accepted a free jar from his neighbour Mrs Gerghiceanu, 63

The heir to the throne owns two properties in Romania and has a keen interest in the history of Transylvania

Mrs Gerghiceanu was even invited to the Romanian Cultural Institute in London to put on a dinner at a Transylvania festival attended by the Prince.

She said: 'People have accused me of cashing in on the fact that Prince Charles tried some of my jam and liked it, and accepted a free jar, but in fact people are investing in the future when they buy my jam. Every time I sell a jar, I pay a local woodsman to plant five oaks in the local forest. 

'I use only organic ingredients in my jam, because I don't know any other way. And I even cook the fruit organically because I use a wood stove fire from the local forest, and then fund the planting of replacement trees.' 

Known locally as Mama Gerda, Mrs Gerghiceanu says her special recipe has been handed down through her family for generations and is made of only natural ingredients.

'I include rose hips, strawberries and mirabelle plums, with everything being prepared on a reed bed. Something like this is worth investing time in,' she said.

'The jars that the jam is sold in are handmade by local glassblower, and the jars complete with contents are then stored in a specially made casket again made from locally produced oak trees.' 

Prince Charles' interest in Romania was sparked by his first visit to the country in 1998 and he has visited regularly since

As well as the expensive 800g jam jars, Mrs Gherghiceanu and her husband Nicu also sell more reasonably priced homegrown fruit and vegetables, as well as poultry, pork and lamb.

Prince Charles' last visit to Viscri came in May, when he met with Count Kalnoky Tibor, a descendent of Hungarian noblemen, when he was not sampling the jam.

The heir to the throne owns two properties in Romania and has a keen interest in the history of Transylvania.

The Prince said: 'Ever since I first visited Romania in 1998, I have been doing my utmost to ensure a sustainable future for the Saxon villages of Transylvania and their people.'

Prince Charles' interest in Romania was sparked by his first visit to the country in 1998 and he has visited regularly since.

He was said to be 'totally overwhelmed by its unique beauty and its extraordinarily rich heritage' after the visit.

The Prince has a keen interest in the history of the area and was particularly moved by the plight of Saxon villages in Transylvania, which were built centuries ago by German settlers who were encouraged to go there to help withstand Tartar and Turkish invasions.

Many of these settlements are now in decline because of mass migration to other parts of Europe, including Britain.

Because of this, in 2006, he decided to buy and restore an 18th century Saxon house in Viscri, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Blue House, which he bought for £12,000,  has blue limewash on the facade, against which are set olive-green shutters. Inside, the courtyard, partly cobbled, is planted with vegetables. A vine grows beneath the eaves.

The furniture consists of old-fashioned painted chests and time-worn wooden benches. There are only three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a kitchen.

He also bought a secluded farmhouse in the village of Zalánpatak, just yards from a forest, in 2010.

The main cabin, heated by log fires and traditional ceramic stoves, has only three rooms. All the furniture - carved wooden beds, 19th-century chairs, an old oil lamp suspended from the ceiling, and an ancient radio - were restored by hand.
