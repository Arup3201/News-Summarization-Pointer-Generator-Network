Police who stopped a car found a vast arsenal of weapons including a claw hammer, a sledgehammer handle and a baseball bat studded with nails and wrapped in barbed wire.

Five gang members admitted possessing an offensive weapon but walked free from court yesterday after saying they intended to damage a man's car rather than a person.

Prosecutor Paul Newcombe told Teesside Crown Court that the baseball bat officers found in the gang's Fiat Punto late one night was 'more suited to Game of Thrones than the streets of Guisborough'.

Concrete blocks, a modified baseball bat, a sledgehammer handle and claw hammer were among the array

Mr Newcombe said: 'It's a very threatening and dangerous weapon.' adding that police also found three concrete bricks, two masks, one of which was a 'Scream' mask, and gloves.

The court heard that driver Kyle Wright, 28, looked nervous when police came across the car in Guisborough, Cleveland, at about 11.20pm on March 17.

He made a U-turn and tried to drive away but was stopped by officers who then found the stash of weapons hidden under seats, in footwells and by the handbrake.

Wright, of Guisborough, told police the implements were 'for protection', though he later said that was a joke, the court heard.

Also in the car were passengers Sean Harris, 27, also from Guisborough, Paul Jeffels, 32, of Easington, Saltburn, Lewis Swatton, 20, from Brotton, and Jamie Haley, 18, from Loftus. 

The prosecutor said: 'While it's unknown exactly what the true purpose of this journey was, it may well be related to a recent stabbing in the area, and possible revenge for that stabbing.'

All five admitted possession of an offensive weapon but said the intention was to damage a man's car.

The court heard they had few or no relevant previous convictions, except for Jeffels who had numerous assaults on his record.

Andrew Turton, defending Harris, said: 'No violence was used. No threats of violence were made.

He said Harris, a college student, was foolish and had alcohol issues, but said he was tackling those and aspired to set up his own business.

Duncan McReddie, representing Wright, said prison would have a serious impact on the single father's two children, and that he had medical problems.

Alex Bousfield, for Jeffels, said: 'It was to be a show of force, it seems, to a certain individual in Guisborough.

'He just went along with it. No member of the public saw any of these weapons.' 

Swatton's barrister Nigel Soppitt said: 'He's very easily led.  He says he was really oblivious at that point through drink and drugs.'

And Peter Makepeace, defending Haley, said he was a hard-working man of previous positive good character, and unlikely to be in court again. 

Judge Howard Crowson told the five: 'I'm not going to lock you up today, but it comes pretty close - this sort of weapon could cause a great deal of harm.

'What we see is the final offences which usually result in dreadful violence and horrible injury.'

He said police information matched the assertion that the men didn't mean to hurt people, but such street violence could have erupted.

He gave Jeffels,  an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for one year, and Wright, Harris and Swatton five-month sentences, suspended for one year.

Wright and Swatton were also each given eight-week tagged curfews, Harris and Jeffels were ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work each, and Haley, of Loftus, was given a one-year conditional discharge. 

Game of Thrones is a fantasy television series based on the novel series A Song Of Fire And Ice by George R. R. Martin.

It has won several awards and nominations, as well as record audience figures, but has also attracted criticism for its ultra-violence, particularly towards women.

Games of Thrones (season four pictured) features terrifying weaponry in its many scenes of violence

Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location in sites around the world including Morocco, Scotland, Croatia and Malta, Game of Thrones spans four seasons and began its original run in October 2011.

The show roughly follows three storylines from the original novels, and is set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. 

But many of the episodes feature violence to women, prompting one critic to write: 'rape has become so pervasive... that it is almost background noise'.
