Paris Saint-Germain's Serge Aurier is the subject of UEFA disciplinary action after posting a video on Facebook criticising the officiating in the French side's Champions League tie with Chelsea.

PSG prevailed on away goals, but only after Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers had sent off Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the first half of the last-16 second-leg tie, which finished 2-2 on the night and 3-3 on aggregate at Stamford Bridge last Wednesday.

Aurier, currently out injured, declared his frustration with the decision - saying 'referee, dirty son of a b***h' - and now faces the prospect of a sanction from European football's governing body.
