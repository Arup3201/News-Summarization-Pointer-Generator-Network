Chelsea showed their strength by overpowering Everton to record a 6-3 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday and move top of the Premier League table.

In an enthralling clash between Jose Mourinho's men and Roberto Martinez's side, the teams shared nine goals and there were several controversial refereeing decisions to add to a dramatic game.

Find out how the players fared in the Barclays Premier League contest.

EVERTON (4-2-3-1)

TIM HOWARD - 5

Couldn’t be faulted for any of the goals he conceded but became embroiled in a squabble with Diego Costa and could have been sent-off if the officials had been more eagle-eyed.

SEAMUS COLEMAN - 6

Provided a brilliant cross for Everton’s first goal and was his usual energetic self but his own goal proved decisive in the ebb and flow of the contest.

PHIL JAGIELKA - 4.5

Not a performance he will look back on with any fondness whatsoever. Costa’s physicality and movement caused him numerous problems and he left the field distraught. 

Nightmare: Phil Jagielka (right) and Sylvain Distin were bullied by Diego Costa and struggled all game

SYLVAIN DISTIN - 4.5

Had a goal correctly ruled out in the first half when he was offside but, like Jagielka, he will be glad to consign this game to history. Too slow to close Matic down for Chelsea’s fourth goal.

LEIGHTON BAINES - 5.5

Pinpoint delivery provided Samuel Eto’o with a debut goal. He kept ploughing a furrow up the left flank but struggled to get much change out of Ivanovic.

GARETH BARRY - 6

What you see is what you get from Barry. Never gives up and uses the ball well but this wasn’t an easy contest against the hulking Nemanja Matic.

Decent: Gareth Barry (left) did an OK job for Everton but he was simply out-fought by powerful Nemanja Matic

JAMES MCCARTHY - 6

He was excellent against Arsenal but didn’t reach the same levels here. Fought hard to try and wrestle the initative off Matic but had to admit defeat in the end.

AIDAN MCGEADY - 6

Bright in the second half and played a smart ball into Naismith for Everton’s third goal but substituted shortly after and his Everton career is yet to take off.

STEVEN NAISMITH - 7

Continued his bright start to the campaign with a third goal in as many games. Never stopped trying and his runs from deep kept Terry and Cahill on their toes.

Form: Steven Naismith scored his third goal in as many games for Everton and impressed once more

KEVIN MIRALLAS - 7

Magnificent header just before half-time changed the atmosphere and lit the fuse for a wonderful second half. Continues to fulfil an important role with his use of the ball and speed.

ROMELU LUKAKU - 5

Didn’t enjoy any kind of fond reunion with his former employers. His run opened the space for Naismith to score Everton’s third goal but, other than that, there wasn’t much for him to cheer.

SAMUEL ETO'O - 7

Took his goal well off the bench against his former side.

MUHAMED BESIC

Familar face: Everton striker Samuel Eto'o scored a header on his debut against former club Chelsea

CHELSEA

THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5

Beaten three times but not at fault for any of them. Commands his area well and is never afraid to charge from his line to try and claim aerial balls.

BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 7

Doesn’t command headlines but his importance for this Chelsea team cannot be underestimated. His standards rarely dip and he always pops up with a goal, as he did here.

GARY CAHILL - 8

Will be furious that he has come off the pitch having conceded three goals. Some of his tackling and intercepting was of the highest class and kept Lukaku under lock and key.

Dominant: Despite conceding three goals, Chelsea defender Gary Cahill was brilliant and commanding at back

JOHN TERRY - 7.5

Again, like Cahill, the goals Chelsea shipped will colour his view of the win. But when Everton tried to get a foothold in the game he was not found wanting.

CESAR AZPILICUETA - 6.5

Needs to up his game with Filipe Luis breathing down his neck. Steady and reliable, stuck to his guns in the second half when Everton tried to turn up the pressure.

NEMANJA MATIC - 8.5

An absolute monster. Gets better every time you see him and by the end of the season he will be saluted as the finest defensive midfielder in the country. Scored the decisive fourth, too.

Powerhouse: Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic (centre) bagged a goal and dominated the midfield play

RAMIRES - 7.5

Another to get on the scoresheet and provided an assist too. Linked well with Matic and covered every blade of grass,

WILLIAN - 6.5

Industrious but not the flashiest performance. Kept the ball, charged forward when the chance allowed. Fulfils a crucial role in this team.

CESC FABREGAS - 7.5

Easy to see why Mourinho wanted to sign him and his effortless passing is making Chelsea a much more attractive side to watch; delightful weight on his ball to Costa for the opener.

Poise: Cesc Fabregas (left) makes Chelsea far more attractive on the eye with some beautiful passing

EDEN HAZARD - 7.5

Some flashes of brilliance, like when he created the third goal. Even when he isn’t in the game for long periods, you always get the sense he is capable of bursting into life.

DIEGO COSTA - 9

He is a match winner, plain and simple. If he carries on at this rate, he will get close to 30 goals this season. Needs to eliminate the unnecessary squabbling with opponents though.
