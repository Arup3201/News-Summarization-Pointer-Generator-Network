Captain John Terry believes Chelsea's 'massive' Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham could be the start of something special for the Blues.

Terry's goal on the stroke of half-time put Chelsea in front at Wembley and a Diego Costa shot that deflected in off Kyle Walker 11 minutes into the second half secured a 2-0 win.

The trophy is the first Chelsea have won since Jose Mourinho returned to the club in 2013 but Terry hopes it is the first of many for the current crop.

Asked how important the win might be for the development of the Chelsea team, Terry told Sky Sports 1: 'That's the first one, it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us (to win the League Cup) in 2004/05 in Jose's first year here.

'That (Sunday's win) could be the start of something special but we have to kick on and we have the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win today.

'The pressure was there before the game, obviously, but that's what cup finals do to you. I thought we played very well, handled the game very well and delighted with the win.

'I think it was fairly even first half, second half I thought we controlled it a little bit better and deserved winners.'
