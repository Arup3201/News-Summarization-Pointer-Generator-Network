A dead whistleblowing lawyer who exposed huge official corruption in Russia was today found guilty of tax evasion by a Moscow court.

Sergei Magnitsky was convicted in the 'show trial' alongside British-based William Browder, the head of the Hermitage Capital investment fund, who was tried in absentia. 

The verdicts are expected to be widely condemned by Western governments and human rights organisations.

The posthumous case is seen in the US and EU as raising serious issues about the rule of law in Moscow, while also highlighting the dangers faced by Russians who challenge the authorities.

'This show trial confirms that Vladimir Putin is ready to sacrifice his international credibility to protect corrupt officials who murdered an innocent lawyer and stole $230million from the Russian state,' said Hermitage Capital in a statement.

'I did not doubt that the decision would look like this,' said Magnitsky family lawyer Dmitry Kharitonov.  'I know that he committed no crimes.'

The case against Magnitsky - who died four years ago - is now closed but judge Igor Alisov was expected to announce a jail sentence for US-born British citizen Browder.

The cage in the Tverskoy District Court,  where the accused would normally sit, was empty for the entire trial.

Magnitsky died in detention aged 37 of untreated pancreatitis in 2009, after accusing  interior ministry officials of organising an elaborate $235-million tax scam.

He was then charged with the very crimes he claimed to have uncovered.

Browder insists Magnitsky was tortured to death with beatings and the refusal of proper medical care, and has vowed have those he alleges were behind the plot brought to justice.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied Magnitsky was beaten to death, insisting the lawyer died of heart failure

The Kremlin's human rights council agreed there was evidence the lawyer was beaten to death.

Putin rejected this saying last year that he died of heart failure.

Browder  was formerly a supporter of  Putin who headed an investment fund that was one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia.

Now he is a vocal critic of Russian authorities and successfully lobbied for the 'Magnitsky Act' in the US which bans officials implicated in the lawyer's death and corruption case from visiting the US, and freezes their assets.

The law caused a storm with Moscow retaliating by refusing to allow Russian children to be adopted to the US.

The case against Magnitsky had been closed after his death but re-opened in 2011 despite strong objections from his family.

State-appointed lawyers represented the dead man in the trial, though were frequently absent from hearings.
