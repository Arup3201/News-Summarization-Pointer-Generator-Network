Some people say it’s a dog, others think it’s a badger and one has even suggested it could be the result of secret government animal testing.

But this roadkill found in Alexandria, Minnesota, has baffled locals and nature officials alike, who cannot identify the mystery carcass.

The dead white animal was found by Lacey Ilse who was driving near her home on County Road 86 and it's since generated huge excitement online.

‘We saw something in the middle of the road, and we knew it wasn't a dog or a cat, because it didn't have hair,’ Ms Ilse told KSAX.

‘It had a clump of hair and all the rest was just white skin. Its ear was all misshaped. To me, it looked like half-human.

‘You know how they do their government secret testing on animals? I know it sounds crazy, but I've never seen an animal like this.’

The mysterious mammal with five claws, dark tufts of hair and long toenails is going viral on Facebook as people try to work out what it is.

Guesses for what it might be include a skunk, pig, badger or wolf. Some have even said it’s a chupacabra, the mythical bloodsucking creature.

Now the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) are involved but have not been able to work out what the animal is.

DNR spokesman Kevin Kotts suggested it’s most likely to be a badger.

‘It's got five long front claws on each of its front feet, which would be characteristic of a badger,’ he told KSAX.

‘I ran the pictures past a few DNR folks that have a lot of trapping and/or fur-bare experience, and they all said, it's hard to be 100 per cent sure.

‘But if it's a Minnesota animal, it's probably a badger.’

Jason Abraham, of the Department of Natural Resources, said the head suggests it is a domestic dog - but told KSAX he is not convinced.

He said: ‘The right front foot appears to have five toes, which is not typical for canines. Also, the long toenails are not typical for an active canine.’
