The contents of the seven-word text message, together with images of an obese woman, which led to rugby star Kurtley Beale being stood down from the Wallabies has been revealed.

The message, which Beale reportedly sent to some teammates and, accidentally, to former team business manager Di Patston was contained in a letter sent by the Australian Rugby Union to Beale, in which they asked for an emergency meeting with the player. 

The letter, reportedly sent on Wednesday, referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reports.

Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds

Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early

The text message is alleged to have been a reference to Ms Patston, who resigned from the Wallabies on Friday following weeks of bad publicity and after a highly publicised row between her and Beale during a flight.

The ARU letter contains the electronic signature of ARU General Counsel Richard Hawkins, according to The Sunday Telegraph.

It reads: 'I refer to my earlier conversation with your manager, Isaac Moses, in relation to the distribution by you of texts which contained photos referencing ARU employee Di Patston. The texts were distributed in June this year. We received them from Ms Patston yesterday.

'The texts are not attached to this letter as, understandably, Ms Patston is extremely sensitive about them being circulated electronically. 

'But as you will be aware: two of them contain photos of extremely obese women: one is accompanied by the caption 'Di', the other by the caption 'Di — who wants a go f****ing this?' They are followed by a number of other texts where you apologise to Ms Patston for circulating them.

Mr Hawkins wrote the ARU considered the distribution of the texts a breach of the ARU Code of Conduct and requests a meeting with Beale and his manager which they later declined.

The matter is now likely to see Beale's Wallaby contract, which expires at the end of the year, terminated at a code of conduct hearing.  

Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina

The controversy dates back to a mid-air confrontation on a flight from South Africa en route to Argentina, where the Wallabies were due to play, last month.

After the incident, coach Ewen McKenzie abandoned a Wallabies training session in Buenos Aires to drive his distressed business manager to the airport so she could fly home early.

Ms Patston has been on indefinite sick leave ever since. 

An ARU spokeswoman confirmed on Saturday that Ms Patston had quit due to stress relating to recent events. 

Beale is facing the axe, not only over the alleged midair incident but also over allegations he circulated the offensive text messages about Ms Patston. 

It's believed some players had become disillusioned by Ms Patston's role in the team and McKenzie's reasons for hiring her.

McKenzie hit back on Friday, insisting his relationship with Patston has always been professional and therefore did not compromise his position as coach.

'I've got a professional relationship with her. And I refute (suggestions of an intimate relationship),' he said.
