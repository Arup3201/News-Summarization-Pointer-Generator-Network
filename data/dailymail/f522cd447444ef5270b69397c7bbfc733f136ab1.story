Walmart has come under fire for using the description 'Fat Girl Costumes' on its website.

Earlier this morning, the disrespectful costume description could be seen above a selection of plus-size outfits for women, however Walmart appears to have re-worded it to 'Women's Plus Size Halloween Costumes' as of 11:30am.

A Walmart representative told MailOnline: 'This never should have been on our site. It is unacceptable, and we apologize.

How rude: A selection of plus-size Halloween costumes for women was labeled 'Fat Girl Costumes' on Walmart's website

'We are working to remove it as soon as possible and ensure this never happens again.'

Wonder Woman, The Queen of Hearts, a witch and a female vampire were among the costumes in the section.

Despite the offensive label, which presumably was never meant to be seen by the public but rather just by the internal Walmart team, the models pictured all appear to be a very healthy size.

Mislabeled: Despite the offensive category, many of the models pictured, such as the women dressed as a vampire (left) and Wonder Woman (right), appear to be an average weight

The retailer removed the rude category after it sparked an outcry on social media.

A firestorm of tweets this morning asked questions such as 'Why?' and 'How did this happen?'

'Stay classy Walmart,' wrote Autumn Mochi, while Dave Jones commented '... and that's how you get fired as a Walmart web developer.'

Fixed: The section, which also includes witch (left) and Queen of Hearts (right) costumes, was renamed 'Women's Plus Size Halloween Costumes' as of 11:30am

Kristyn Washburn tweeted at Walmart, 'Not sure labeling these as "Fat Girl Costumes" is the best approach #rude.' 

The company's official Twitter account simply replied, 'Your comments and suggestions are important to us and help make Walmart even better. Thank you. -Nao.'

At the time this story was published, a Google search of the term 'Walmart fat girl costumes' still brought up the page.
