It's not every day you have to share a suburban road with an emu and one Queensland motorist made sure he put the furry bird back in his place. 

Eric the emu, as the bird has been named by the locals of Bribie Island in Queensland, is known for strutting his stuff around the streets and has become quiet famous for his daily escapades. 

However, one perturbed motorist, who happened to come across Eric walking in the middle of the road, was less than impressed with having to share the road with the gigantic black bird.

Caught on camera sauntering down the middle of Banksia Beach's main street, the motorist had to swerve his car out of the way to avoid the confident bird. 

The man wound down his window, while Eric the emu carried on down the street as if it were his catwalk.  

'Excuse me mate,' the male driver shouted out the window of his car.

After Eric the Emu refuses to even acknowledge the man's call, the man proceeds to hurl abuse at the Emu.

'Get off the bloody road you d***head' he said.

Eric the Emu, who has over 2000 likes on his Facebook page, has been spotted everywhere on the island from under trees to in locals' gardens, along with over 300 other bird species who inhabit the sunny beach location.
