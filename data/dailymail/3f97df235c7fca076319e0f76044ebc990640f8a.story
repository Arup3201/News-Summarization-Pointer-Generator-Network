Charged: Dappy was allegedly involved in an assault outside Chicago's nightclub in Essex

Former N-Dubz singer Dappy been charged with assault over an incident outside a nightclub in Essex.

Although he was later charged, the 26-year-old took to Twitter to tell his fans that he'd 'had a great night' performing at Chicago's nightclub in the city of Chelmsford.

Essex Police said the alleged attack happened outside the nightclub in the early hours of yesterday morning, with Dappy, real name Costadinos Contostavlos, bailed pending a court appearance.

Dappy was arrested after an appearance at Chicago's nightclub in the city.

He posted a message on Twitter which read: 'Had a great night in Chicagos. Crowd was amazing.'

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Costadinos Contostavlos, aged 26, from Sandridge, St Albans, has been charged with an assault by beating following an incident outside a nightclub in Moulsham Street in Chelmsford in the early hours of February 27.'

The statement added: 'He has been released on bail prior to his appearance at Chelmsford Magistratesâ€™ Court on March 19.'

Dappy finished in second place on reality show Celebrity Big Brother last month, behind former television presenter Jim Davidson.

The band consisted of Dappy, his cousin Tulisa Contostavlos and her ex-boyfriend Richard 'Fazer' Rawson, but the group decided to focus on their solo careers rather than continue together.

Their second album Against All Odds was released on 16 November 2009, and debuted at number 6 in the UK. It went platinum around two months after its release.

Fazer has released a handful of solo 
singles since the split, and has set up a production company
