With its Star Trek theme, the civil partnership ceremony of Anita Wood and her lesbian lover certainly attracted lots of attention.

Sadly for Wood, the fancy dress event caught the eye of investigators looking into fraudulent benefits claims.

The bizarre wedding photos proved the blushing bride had falsely claimed £16,000 as an unemployed single person when she was living with partner Margaret Wood, who was in full-time employment.

The Star Trek fan was duly ‘beamed up’
to magistrates’ court where she was ordered to repay all the cash and 
given a suspended  jail sentence.

Mother-of-two Wood, then called Anita 
Bayliss, met her partner on an internet forum for Star Trek fans, who 
are known as Trekkies.

The pair held a civil partnership ceremony in 2011 at the Liberty Stadium, home to Premier League football club Swansea City.

The event was covered in local and 
online press, and featured photographs of the pair in matching white 
outfits, based on the character Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

All 40 of their guests dressed up as 
the crew of the Starship Enterprise – with both of Wood’s sons wearing 
Captain Kirk outfits.

Wood said at the time: ‘We have always
been into the show. I watched the original series as a child and you 
just enjoy the escapism and the humour of it all.’

But after the ceremony Wood carried on
claiming benefits, without telling the Department of Work and Pensions 
her civil partner had a full-time job, Swansea magistrates heard.

Prosecutor Felicity Lewis said: ‘Anita Wood should have declared that 
she and Margaret Wood were in a civil partnership.

‘It would have reduced the amount of benefits she was entitled to claim as Margaret Wood was in full-time employment.

‘A member of the council’s benefits 
team reported concerns and a joint investigation was conducted by 
council investigators and the DWP.’

By the time the fraud was 
discovered, Wood, 48, had illegally claimed £16,000 in benefits, 
magistrates were told.

Wood, of Gendros, Swansea, admitted 
six offences of benefit fraud by failing to declare a change in her 
circumstances. She was sentenced to 12 weeks’ jail, suspended for a 
year.

She was also ordered to repay the money she claimed as well as £150 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

She told the court her 50-year-old 
civil partner had not been paying half the bills after moving into her 
home, only enough to cover her bed and board.

After the case, Wood said her offence 
had been ‘simply an oversight’. ‘It wasn’t intentional. We had declared 
Margaret as a non-dependent but not a partner,’ she said. ‘I was 
devastated. My whole family has been affected by it. I’ve never done 
anything wrong in my life, or anyone in my family.’

Tal Davies, Swansea Council’s 
investigations manager, said: ‘We are pleased our work is getting 
results and will continue to find all those who steal benefits.

‘Benefits fraud is not a victimless 
crime and last year alone 163 people were punished for benefit fraud 
with prison sentences, community service orders, formal cautions or 
fines and also had to repay their illegally obtained benefits.’
