Affluent and attractive, Dorset has been ranked the best place for a golden retirement.

In fact, it is one of a string of areas in the west of Britain that top a league table of ‘grey hotspots’.

But there is one notable exception to the catalogue of picturesque or coastal destinations. 

Second place in the list was the comfortable if unglamorous Midlands’ town of Solihull.

Dorset has long scored strongly in official records for its high life expectancy, good health, and general affluence.

The table, compiled by analysts at the Prudential, reflects levels of home ownership, health, the number of unpaid carers who help relatives, the numbers of pension-age people who are married, and, as a measure of the ability of local retired people to enjoy travel, the number of pensioners who hold passports.

Many of the top 10 destinations are coastal or highly picturesque areas which have long attracted those able to afford to move after retirement to the most attractive parts of the country. 

They include the coastal districts of the Vale of Glamorgan, North Somerset; the county of Hampshire and the Dorset town of Poole; Monmouthshire, which includes the Wye Valley and the Brecon Beacons; and South Gloucestershire, which lies between the Cotswolds and the Severn Estuary.

The Glamorgan district includes Barry and a coastline comparable to North Cornwall; North Somerset includes the resort of Weston-super-Mare; and Hampshire has both popular coastal resorts and attractive country towns. Poole includes the fabulously expensive seaside mansion suburb of Sandbanks.

Solihull, on the other hand, offers a Land Rover factory, most of Birmingham airport, and easy access to the M42.

The area is, however, long established as a well-off suburb with good schools and high house prices, and its strength as a retirement zone may have come about because its residents are reluctant to move out when they leave their jobs.

Vince Smith-Hughes of Prudential said: ‘Our analysis clearly shows that the quality of life experienced by retirees varies significantly across the country.

‘However, it is not always possible for people to up sticks and move to a location they consider to be more desirable, when the time comes to give up work. 

'Family ties and the cost of moving home often dictate where people find themselves living as pensioners.’

The Quality of Retirement Index was produced by examining statistics on 170 local authority areas with the largest numbers of retirees. 

Quality of retirement score out of 50.

Dorset: 46

Solihull: 44

Vale of Glamorgan: 42

North Somerset: 42

Buckinghamshire: 42

Monmouthshire: 41

Poole: 41

South Gloucstershire: 41

Each was given a percentage score on the five retirement factors taken into account, and the results were put together to give a final tally out of 50.

Solihull scored 44 points, with more than eight out of 10 pensioners owning their homes and nearly as many holding passports, while more than half are in good health and nearly half are married rather than single, divorced or widowed. 

More than one in eight of its population provide unpaid care to children, a spouse, a partner or to a relative or a friend.

Dorset towns and villages are a favoured destination for people retiring from jobs in major cities. 

The town of Wimborne has the highest number of married people in the country; the Prudential last year named Christchurch as the town with the highest concentration of pensioners in its population; and in West Dorset one in 10 of the population are likely to be aged over 85 in less than 20 years’ time.

The report said: ‘Dorset was found to provide retirees with the best quality of life. Dorset has one of the highest retirement populations in the country.’

Mr Smith-Hughes said: ‘People looking to secure a retirement in an area where the quality of life is already high, or those simply looking to be as financially comfortable as possible when they give up work, are well advised to follow the simple rule of saving as much as possible as early as possible in their working lives.'
