Following her loss to Serena Williams in the Australian Open final, Maria Sharapova is gearing up for her first appearance at the Mexican Open.

Sharapova, who lost in straight sets to Williams at the Melbourne finale in January, arrived in Mexico on Friday and is being widely tipped to claim the title at the Acapulco tournament.

World No 2 Sharapova will look to put her disappointment in Australia to one side after losing to Williams for the 16th time in a row.

Sara Errani, who claimed the Mexico Open title in 2012 and 2013, looks the most likely to halt the progress of Sharapova following her impressive performances at the Rio Open in Brazil.

The other seeds in action at the tournament are Caroline Garcia, Irina-Camelia Begu, Timea Bacsinszky, Roberta Vinci, Sloane Stephens and Madison Brengle.

The WTA International event kicks off on Monday.
