Shane Rattenbury had a close encounter with a kangaroo during his morning jog and came away with deep scratches and bruising

An Australian politician has been attacked by a kangaroo on his morning jog.

Shane Rattenbury, a minister in the Australian Capital Territory government, almost collided with the eastern grey kangaroo, which was grazing on a front lawn in a Canberra suburb.

'We both got a nasty fright, and of course when kangaroos are startled, they lash out,' Mr Rattenbury said.

'As the kangaroo sought to escape, it landed on me, and its claws dug into my leg.'

Mr Rattenbury, 41, says the 4ft 7in kangaroo left him with two deep scratches to his left leg and bruising to his right leg.

Moments later, a passer-by spotted the minister on the ground in Ainslie and drove him home. He was taken to hospital and given a tetanus shot.

'The nurse who treated me had treated someone before who had been scratched by a kangaroo and ended up with a very bad infection,' he said.

'So she was quite keen to give it a good clean-out.'

Mr Rattenbury arrived at the ACT parliament yesterday three hours after his encounter, and found most of his colleagues were more concerned about the kangaroo's welfare than his.

'I can assure people that the kangaroo is fine,' he said. 'It was last seen hopping off into the distance quite comfortably.'

He posted a picture of his injuries to his Twitter page and assured his followers that the mugger had not made off with his wallet or watch.

Kangaroos are among Australia's most loved native species, featuring alongside an emu on the nation's coat of arms.

But there are so many kangaroos around Canberra that the ACT government maintains a controversial culling program to contain them.

Mr Rattenbury, who is a member of the Greens party, said he accepts the scientific evidence that kangaroo numbers have to be controlled around Canberra.

'Without a predator, kangaroos have 
increased their abundance and have a detrimental impact on the rest of 
the ecosystem,' he said. 'The Greens have not opposed that cull.

'I
really enjoy seeing kangaroos and we're very lucky in Canberra to have 
them as part of our neighbourhoods, but I usually prefer to keep them at
a bit more of a distance than this,' he said.

Mr Rattenbury told CNN the encounter had not put him off running and he intended to be out the next day to continue with his triathlon training.

Kangaroos
rarely harm people, although in 2009 one jumped through a bedroom 
window of a Canberra home late at night and terrorised a family before a
householder wrestled it out the front door.

Wildlife veterinarian Karen Vickers said more kangaroos were likely to venture deeper into Canberra suburbs in search of watered lawns to feed in the drier months ahead and that people should be wary.

'It sounds like they startled each other and Shane came off worse,' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.

'They're really not out to get us.'
