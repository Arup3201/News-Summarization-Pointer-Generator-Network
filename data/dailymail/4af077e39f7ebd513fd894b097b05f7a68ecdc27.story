A chilling video has emerged showing the merciless execution of 14 men in Syria by a brutal group that are too extreme even for Al Qaeda.

It shows the blindfolded men - some of whom appear to be just teenagers - kneeling in front of a pit at night, illuminated by torchlight.

A man, horrifyingly calm, shoots the first man in the back of the head with a pistol. It is here that the video freezes, the scenes too horrible to show.

Chilling: The first man is shot in the back of the head. A further 13 die in the dirt

More shots follow in quick, methodical succession. By the end, there are 14 blood-spattered corpses in and around the mass grave.

It was obtained by CNN from Syrian activists attempting to show the world the atrocities committed by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, known as ISIS, a powerful group opposing the rule of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad that has recently battled other opposition groups.

Their methods, including savage mass executions like this, have even drawn condemnation from Al Qaeda commanders, who have demanded the group leave the war-torn nation.

ISIS fighters are reportedly mostly non-Syrian extremist Muslims who have inserted themselves into the civil war to spread their hardline Islamic beliefs.

Earlier this month the mainstream Syrian Opposition Coalition released a report stating that the regime of Bashar al-Assad is working hand in hand with ISIS, reportedly the largest terrorist group in Syria.

A point by point report issued by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces documents an active partnership between Assad and the group.

The opposition says it has numerous firsthand accounts from the battlefields confirming that the regimeâ€™s forces and the Islamist extremist group act together in attacking Free Syrian Army forces and are intimately intertwined.

The
 Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,is a pro Al Qaida group 
jihadist group that many fear is taking an iron grip over parts of 
Syria.

The group was 
formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate organisation 
in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting 
government forces in Syria.

The
 final 's' in the acronym Isis stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. 
This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of 
the global jihad it refers to the Levant.

Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists.

Analysts
 say non-Syrians constitute a majority of Isis's elite fighter corps and
 are disproportionately represented in its leadership.

It
 took over the city of Raqqa after rebels overran the city in March 
2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control.

It
 also has a presence in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in
 the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule 
in the areas that it controls.Inter-rebel tension

The
 group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as
 the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in 
Syria.

In July, a 
commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly 
shot dead by Isis fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia.

There
 were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the 
north-western province of Idlib. Isis also seized the northern town of 
Azaz from the FSA on 18 September.

There
 has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was
 accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel 
group Ahrar al-Sham.

In
 the most recent sign of continuing tension, ISIS suffered losses in two
 days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in Aleppo 
and Idlib provinces.
