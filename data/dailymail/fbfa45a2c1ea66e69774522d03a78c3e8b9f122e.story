Drew Rosenhaus has filed for divorce after just over a year of marriage.

The NFL super-agent cited 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for his wish to split from Lisa Thomson, a Miami real estate agent who also appeared on The Amazing Race.

This all comes just one week after Thomson called police to come to their house after the two had been in an argument, saying she feared for her safety because there were guns on the premises.

Miami police left that evening without making an arrest.

Now, Thomson is opening up about the incident to the Miami Herald, and placing the blame on the couple's strained relationship with Ronsenhaus' brother, Jason.

'If you’re looking for the real reason of the divorce, it might be because Jason’s always at the house,' says Thomson.

'They both work from there. There’s no privacy.'

In her complaint to police, Thomson also said that her husband and his brother had been verbally abusing her after returning home from wathcing the NFL playoffs that day.

Shortly after, Rosenhaus handed Thomson a plastic bag, telling her to get her things and get out of the house.

The pair were married in November 2013, and the home is owned by Rosenhaus and his brother. 

Thomson also points out another problem the two face is their age difference.

'I’m 29 and I like to go out,' explained Thomson. 

'I’m a Realtor. I’m always out with clients. Drew doesn’t like me to have my own life.'

She went on to say her 48-year-old husband did nothing wrong on the evening in question.

Despite all of this however, Thomson thinks the pair may still be able to work things out. 

'It’s a tough time of year for him,' said Thomson.

'He’s always busy and gone. We’ll probably sit down and talk after the Super Bowl.'

Rosenhaus, who some say was the basis for the character Jerry Maguire, will be in Phoenix this weekend with one of his biggest clients - New England Patriots star Rob Gronkowski.
