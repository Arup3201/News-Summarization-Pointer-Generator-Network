Former Charlton and West Ham manager Alan Curbishley has joined Fulham’s coaching team until the end of the season.

Curbishley has been brought in to help out manager Kit Symons in the remaining 11 matches in the Championship this season. 

Curbishley spent a short spell at Fulham as director of football last season – but was sacked when Felix Magath was appointed manager in February last year.

Fulham have struggled in recent weeks and are 20th in the Championship and have won just once in their last eight games.

Now Symons has brought Curbishley back to the club as part of his backroom team, and the Fulham manager said: ‘I am delighted. Alan is someone who I know reasonably well. And I know him by reputation extremely well. He’s been around a long time with a wealth of experience.

‘That’s the one thing that myself and my staff, who have been fantastic I’ve got to say, haven’t got at that level. He’s got that experience in abundance. I’ ll be certainly tapping into him trying to get as much knowledge and use his experience as much as possible.

‘I want to be as good as I can be and want the staff to be as good as they can be and I want the football club to do as well as it can. And Alan Curbishley coming in will help that.’
