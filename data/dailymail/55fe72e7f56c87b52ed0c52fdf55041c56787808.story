Sir Richard Branson last night launched a dramatic court bid to prevent the Government stripping him of his lucrative  rail franchise.

The Virgin boss is seeking a judicial review of the decision to hand a 13-year franchise to run the West Coast Main Line to rival First Group, which bid £2billion more.

His move came just hours before Transport Secretary Justine Greening was due to formally sign off the deal with FirstGroup.

Blow: Sir Richard Branson's train company has lost its West Coast franchise but vowed yesterday to run it for free if Labour manages to halt the contract being signed by FirstGroup tomorrow

Miss Greening last night indicated the court action was likely to delay the signing, at least temporarily.

Sir Richard branded the Government’s 
decision this month ‘insane’, claiming First Group bid too much and will
either pull out of the franchise early or go bust.

The billionaire entrepreneur appealed
to David Cameron to intervene, and called for the contract to be 
examined by MPs. Miss Greening yesterday insisted the process had been 
‘fair’.

Yesterday Virgin Trains, which has operated the West Coast line since 1997,  said the procurement process had ‘ignored substantial risks to taxpayers’.

On the legal challenge, FirstGroup 
said: ‘There has been no complaint about the process, which was 
carefully described in advance, until Virgin Rail Group had lost.’

Following the West Coast decision by the Department for Transport (DfT), Transport Secretary Justine Greening had been due to sign off the contract this week.

Virgin is now hoping that its legal challenge will delay the signing.

In the past few days, Labour and members of the House of Commons Transport Committee said they hoped the final signing could be deferred until the matter could be debated in Parliament.

The business magnate has repeatedly expressed concerns that FirstGroup would not be able to live up to its financial and service-providing targets for West Coast.

The tycoon said: 'We had hoped that Parliament or an external review would be able to scrutinise this badly-flawed process before the franchise was signed.'

In a statement, Virgin said yesterday: 'Virgin Trains Limited (VTL) has yesterday commenced court proceedings in respect of the decision to award the West Coast Main Line franchise to FirstGroup.

'We have tried for three weeks to get clarity over the DfT’s decision and to have a number of key questions answered. On each occasion we have been refused information.

'We are left with no choice but to commence court proceedings as we believe the procurement process has ignored the substantial risks to taxpayers and customers of delivering FirstGroup’s bid over the course of the franchise.'

Virgin went on: 'In addition it (the process) has ignored the DfT’s own assessment that VTL’s bid was more deliverable and a lower risk. We question whether FirstGroup’s bid has been correctly risk adjusted by the department given all of its supposed incremental value is delivered after 2022.

'The current process is geared to selecting the highest risk bid and needs to be independently audited to prevent a repeat of former franchise failures.'

The billionaire said hopes of a Parliamentary or external review would be denied 'if the DfT follows through with its determination to rush through the process before Parliament returns next week'.

He added that signing off the franchise now 'ignores the wishes of more than 150,000 people who signed the Downing Street e-petition in 10 days, the Labour Opposition, two important Commons committees and many backbench Conservative MPs who wanted a debate before the decision is taken, not a post-mortem afterwards'.

Sir Richard said: 'We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the only course now available to try to unravel this sorry process.'

Virgin Rail has lost its West Coast main line franchise to transport company FirstGroup, in a bidding war which Sir Richard branded 'insane'

Such is his desperation for the 
decision to be reviewed, the Virgin boss made an offer to run the West 
Coast Main Line for free, allowing Parliament time to scrutinise the 
decision, which the Virgin boss calls 'outrageous', to award the 
franchise to rival FirstGroup.

He has claimed that FirstGroup's bid 
will lead to 'almost certain bankruptcy' and made the last-ditch appeal 
to the Government to delay signing the 13-year contract on Tuesday.

He said Virgin Trains and Stagecoach 
would operate the joint venture on a not-for-profit basis or donate 
profits to charity if the franchise needed to be extended beyond 
December for a few months to allow Parliament to investigate the 
decision.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening had been due to sign off the contract this week

Responding to news of the legal challenge, FirstGroup said yesterday: 'We have every confidence in the DfT’s process which is rigorous, detailed and fair and in which bids are thoroughly tested. There has been no complaint about the process, which was carefully described in advance, until Virgin Rail Group had lost commercially.'

FirstGroup went on: 'Our plans for the new InterCity West Coast franchise include faster journeys, new trains, more seats and more direct services from London than currently on offer.

'There will be improved wifi, better catering, refurbished stations and standard anytime fares will be reduced by 15% on average within the first two years. We look forward to welcoming passengers to their new and exciting InterCity West Coast service in December and creating a better railway for all.

'Our focus is to ensure a smooth transition with continuity for staff and passengers alike. We want to get on with delivering the many benefits and improvements we are offering without delay or disruption. We will continue to prepare for a successful start up of the new franchise on December 9.'

The new West Coast franchise will last for 13 years and four months, with an option to extend to a total of 15 years.

Last year, Virgin, which more than doubled annual passenger numbers during its 15-year stewardship of the line, paid a £168 million premium to the Government on West Coast.

The FirstGroup bid is worth £5.5 billion at net present value, with Virgin believed to have bid £4.8 billion. FirstGroup’s annual premiums will grow steadily over the course of its franchise.

Sir Richard fears that FirstGroup will run into financial difficulties in the same way that two former operators of the East Coast main line - GNER and National Express - did.

He said that for Virgin to have bid more on West Coast 'would have involved dramatic cuts to customer quality and considerable fare rises which we were unwilling to entertain'.
