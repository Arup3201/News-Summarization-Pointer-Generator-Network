Andrea Casiraghi and Tatiana Santo Domingo have finally introduced their adorable son Sacha to the world, a year and a half after he was born.

The couple, who recently announced that they are expecting their second child together, and their 19-month-old son attended Monaco's National Day celebrations at the Palais Princier de Monaco alongside the rest of the royal family, including Prince Albert of Monaco and his pregnant wife Charlene.

But all of the excitement of the day seemed to prove too much for the little boy, who spent much of his time on the royal balcony cuddling his father and mother, while gazing down at the crowd with a rather bemused - and slightly grumpy - expression.

Give us a smile! Young Sacha made his first public appearance earlier today - but didn't seem too happy about the whole experience

The youngster and his parents were joined on the balcony by Pierre Casiraghi, Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Andrea's mother, Sacha's grandmother Princess Caroline.

Despite spending much of the day with a frown on his face, Sacha was otherwise incredibly well behaved throughout the official event and seemed more than content to be passed around from family member to family member as the festivities continued. 

Dressed in a fetching pair of green velveteen dungarees, smart white shirt and grey knee-high socks, Sacha received kisses and cuddles from his grandmother and his aunt, Princess Alexandra. 

It is not the first time that Sacha has attended such a prestigious event; according to reports, the young boy was present when his parents, Andrea, 30, and New York-born designer Tatiana, celebrated their nuptials with a private party earlier this year.

Having already tied the knot in August 2013, just five months after Tatiana gave birth to Sacha, the couple hosted a second celebration in Gstaad, Switzerland on February 1, where they exchanged their vows in a candlelit Roman Catholic service. 

In addition to their son, the ceremony was attended by a number of their close family and friends, including Princess Caroline, Prince Albert and the groom's siblings, Pierre, Charlotte and Alexandra.

The young boy's first public debut comes as Monaco celebrated its 158th national day, which takes place on the anniversary of Prince Rainier III's and Prince Albert II's coronations in 1949 and 2005.

Last night, locals enjoyed a spectacular firework display over the harbor before a mass in the Cathedral this morning.  

Representatives of the Knights of Malta were among guests at the event, as were ambassadors to the principality and local dignitaries.

Following the mass, crowds gathered at the Place St. Nicholas before making their way to the Palais Princier to catch a glimpse of the royal family.

While he is currently the baby of the family, young Sacha will soon have company in the form of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene's twins. 

The royal couple announced they were expecting in May but the news that Princess Charlene was carrying twins was unofficially broken on Twitter a week later by a friend of the princess' father.

South African TV presenter Derek Watts, a friend of Mike Wittstock, tweeted: 'My old Bulawayo schoolmate Mike Wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats Princess Charlene and Albert!'

The official announcement of the twins was only made last month, with the Palace releasing a statement that read: 'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.'
