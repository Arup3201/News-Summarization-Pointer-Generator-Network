A loving granddaughter skipped her high school graduation ceremony in Wyoming and instead wore her cap and gown to a Texas hospital to surprise her grandmother who was battling leukemia.  

Sharon Thompson, who was recovering from brain surgery at the Houston Methodist Hospital, was proudly watching a live feed of her eldest grandchild Taylor Thompson's graduation in Cody, Wyoming. However, when Taylor's name was called she burst into her 70-year-old grandmother's hospital room instead of appearing on stage. 

And now a video of the touching moment has become an internet sensation, with the YouTube clip – which was first shared last June – accumulating more than a million views, the majority of which were amassed during the last two days. 

Perfect prank: Taylor Thompson (left) skipped her graduation and surprised her grandmother Sharon Thompson (right), who was in the hospital recovering from brain surgery as she battled cancer 

The touching footage shows Sharon, who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, enjoying the graduation ceremony from the confinements of her hospital bed. But before her granddaughter's name was called, the speaker made a surprising announcement.

'The next graduate is not here this evening because she has a surprise for someone special in her life,' the announcer said. 'Her grandmother has been battling cancer this past year and can't be at graduation, so she is watching the ceremony live over the internet right now.'

He added: 'Dressed in her cap and gown, our graduate is going to walk into her grandmother's hospital room as I call her name.'

Sharon burst into tears of joy when she realized what was happening. 

'I can't believe it,' she told her granddaughter who was also moved to tears. 'I am so happy to see you.'

Shocking surprise: She was filled with joy when she realized that Taylor had come to visit her instead of walking in the ceremony, which was taking place in Cody, Wyoming that very moment 

Unforgettable gift: Sharon happily cupped Taylor's face in her hands, later telling her that everyone should have a granddaughter like her

In the middle of the emotional moment, Sharon joked: 'This is enough to push me over the edge.'

Sharon then held Taylor's face in her hands and told her how pretty she looked in her cap and gown. 

Taylor explained to her grandmother that she had flown to Houston the day before and that she had been pulling her leg the entire time.

'Everybody should have a granddaughter like you,' Sharon replied.

Hanging above Sharon's hospital bed was a banner that the nurses had made her, which read: 'Congratulations Taylor Class of 2014.' 

But she couldn't get over the unexpected surprise. 

Magic moment: Taylor took a moment to hug her grandfather, who was also unaware of her plan 

'It's like a dream - a good dream,' Sharon said. 'It's real. I got to touch you.'

At the end of the clip, Taylor kept with the commencement tradition and moved the tassel to the left side of her cap before throwing it in the air. 

'To me, graduation was much more special how I did it,' Taylor told Cody Enterprise last year. 'It was the ultimate graduation for me.'

And Sharon confirmed that she had ‘no idea' what her granddaughter was planning.  

'I had given her pearl earrings, her birth stone, and she was wearing them,' she explained. 'I had brain surgery the day before and thought I was hallucinating.' 

She added: 'Oh my gosh, it was the surprise of a lifetime. Really wonderful, it made my day. My husband didn’t even know.'
