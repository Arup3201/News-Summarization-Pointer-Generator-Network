A Chinese man was badly burned after static electricity from his clothes ignited fumes from a gas leak at his home as he dressed.

Wen Chung suffered second and third degrees to his face, neck and hands in an explosion at his home in Jiangdu, in eastern China, that his nephew said could be felt 300 metres away.

The 78-year-old is being treated for injuries at the Northern Jiangsu People’s Hospital that his relatives say were partly caused during his attempts to put the fire out.

The initial explosion burnt his face, then Mr Chung sustained further injuries to his hands as he desperately tried to stop the flames spreading.

Mr Chung's nephew told The Global Times: ‘The power of the explosion was very strong. You could feel the blast within a 300-meter radius.

‘Three doors fell down, and the glass in the windows broke into pieces.’

Spark: Lightning is an extreme static discharge

Safety officials believe that static electricity from Mr Chung’s clothes ignited fumes that had been leaking from a faulty pipe.

Lightning is an extreme example of static electricity, caused by ice particles rubbing together in storm clouds.

But even small amounts of static electricity, as the horrific case of Mr Chung shows, can be a life-threatening hazard.
