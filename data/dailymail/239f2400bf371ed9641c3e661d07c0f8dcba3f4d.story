Ronny Deila has warned that his transfer wish-list will become irrelevant if Celtic don't qualify for the Champions League group stages.

The Norwegian takes charge of his first game on Scottish soil on Tuesday night when the Parkhead side seek to close out their second qualifying round tie with KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield.

Leading 1-0 from the first leg in Iceland, Celtic are fully expected to advance to the next round despite their temporary surroundings and a pitch which is a combination of grass and an artificial surface.

But Deila warned that only by completing the job and negotiating the next two hurdles lying in wait will he retain a prospect of being handed the funds to land the calibre of player he covets.

'Of course, qualifying for the Champions League is very important when it comes to attracting players. That's a huge thing and it is a big target for us,' said the manager who will be without injured Anthony Stokes.

'We work together at Celtic. I talk with Peter (Lawwell) and he has the same task as me - to make Celtic as good as possible without putting the club out of order economically. There's no problem at all. It's very easy.

'But you know what kind of money there is. It doesn't compete with the biggest clubs in Europe. But it is big in Scottish terms.

'We are looking for quality and that's very hard just now, when a lot of the big clubs in the rest of the world haven't even started pre-season.

'You have to beat clubs like Manchester City who can just buy the ones they want when they want. The biggest get their food first - then the rest of us come after. That's the challenge we have.

'The longer the window goes, the bigger the opportunities get. There is more pressure on every club and they have to take decisions. So, for me, quality is the word - that means someone who can go in and do something at once. But there is also quality in those who can be longer-term prospects.' 

Stokes has a thigh injury, joining skipper Scott Brown and James Forrest on the sidelines but Kris Commons is expected to be fit despite training on his own yesterday.

Deila, also missing the departed Georgios Samaras from last season's squad, believes those players remaining at his disposal have the wherewithal to make the group stages.

'Anthony, of course, is a very good footballer so it is not ideal he is not available - but we have many strikers in the squad so it isn't the worst position for us to lose players from,' he added.

'It is only for this game, though, he will be back for the next one.  

'I'm confident the current squad can get us to the group stage. A lot of them have been there and done it before. But it's not exactly the same, because we have lost Samaras, Brown and Forrest for these big games. But other players have to take steps and get us into the Champions League.' 

Meanwhile, stand-in skipper Charlie Mulgrew declared the squad completely satisfied with Murrayfield's new hybrid surface after training on it.

'It's a class stadium. The pitch is great so we can't complain,' he said.
