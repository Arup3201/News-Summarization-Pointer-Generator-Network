The woman, who has two children, left the hospital wearing only her medical gown and was given a ride by a Good Samaritan who also provided Sims with clothes before realizing she was an escaped prisoner. 

Sims, who is a heroin addict according to police, was arrested last Friday after being found at the New Albany Walmart with prescription drugs in her purse.

She was charged with theft and possession of a controlled substance, WHAS-TV reported.

It is though that Sims escaped and went to meet her boyfriend Chris Gentry who is believed to be the father of her unborn child.

Gentry was not arrested with Sims but there is a warrant out for his arrest over a probation violation.

Sims was on the run for around 28 hours before family members made contact with her and convinced her to hand herself in on Monday afternoon.

A police spokesman said: 'She ended up coming with her sister and co-operated 100 per cent with law enforcement.'

Sims is now back in Floyd County Jail after being checked out by doctors and is expected to appear in court on Wednesday.

When asked why she had ran from police at the hospital, she said that she had 'freaked out' over the shoplifting charge.

Relieved: A police spokesman for Floyd County in Indiana said that Sims was a 'good person' who had freaked out over the theft charge
