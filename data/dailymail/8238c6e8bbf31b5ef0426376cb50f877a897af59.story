Greater Western Sydney's Heath Shaw will undergo counselling after Melbourne police arrested the AFL player for drunken behaviour on Saturday morning.

Shaw was in Melbourne to support older brother Rhyce, who played in the Sydney side that was smashed in Saturday's AFL grand final.

The GWS player, who was not charged, received a fine of $590 for the early morning incident.

'Shaw was a passenger in a car which was pulled over by police ... after a verbal altercation with police, he was taken to St Kilda police station,' a statement from GWS said.

GWS chief executive David Matthews suggested Shaw notified the club of the incident and accepted 'he let himself down on this occasion and that his behaviour was unacceptable'.

'We are disappointed with what happened and so is he and we have agreed that he will undergo counselling,' Matthews said in the statement.

'We have also agreed to consider the matter further when he returns to the club after his current leave period.'

Shaw joined the Giants at the end of the 2013 season.

This is not Shaw's first off-field offence. In 2008 the former club Collingwood suspended the 28-year-old and Alan Didak  for lying about a drink-driving accident.
