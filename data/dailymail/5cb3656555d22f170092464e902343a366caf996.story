The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to close friend Joan Rivers praising her 'enormous zest for life' after her death yesterday at the age of 81.

Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, said they were 'deeply saddened' to hear the news about the comedian, who died in a Manhattan hospital yesterday after she went into cardiac arrest during a routine throat procedure last week.

Miss Rivers was a guest at the royal couple's wedding in 2005 and also performed for the Prince, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry at the We Are Most Amused comedy gala, in aid of the Prince's Trust.

In a statement released by Clarence House today, the Prince of Wales said: 'Joan Rivers was an extraordinary woman with an original and indefatigable spirit, an unstoppable sense of humour and an enormous zest for life. She will be hugely missed and utterly irreplaceable.'

The comedian struck up an unlikely friendship with the royal couple in 2003, when they were introduced on a painting holiday in the South of France by a mutual friend.

As they became closer, she was invited to the couple’s wedding reception at Windsor Castle — one of only four Americans on the list — and took part in a comedy show to mark Charles’ 60th birthday in 2008.

She also enjoyed private charity dinners at the Prince's Highgrove estate and was a keen supporter of osteoporosis suffers, a cause close to Camilla's heart.

In 2011, she recalled the time she enjoyed a dinner at the estate and made a toast against all protocol saying, 'I just want to say that this is for all you b*****s in the room who married your husbands for their money.

'I know who you are and Charles knows, too, because I've pointed you all out to him', leaving her royal hosts in laughter.

She also added how the couple got her humour adding: '‘I’d already told Camilla a joke about Cher liking younger men so much that she hangs around Toys ‘R’ Us, and she got it straight away.

'Charles and Camilla have a great sense of humour.

'He (Prince Charles) is so charming, so humorous. All the ­passions that everyone used to laugh at him for — organic food, architecture, talking to the flowers, we’re all into those things now.

'He is so far ahead of his time, and I think he will be a very good monarch. He is a very smart man and I adore him.'

The legendary comedienne was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York a week ago after going into cardiac arrest during an outpatient procedure on her vocal chords at another clinic, which is now under investigation.

Miss Rivers, who was mother to Melissa, and doting grandmother to Melissa’s son Cooper, had most recently hosted Fashion Police on the E! network.

In a statement released yesterday, Melissa said: 'It is with great sadness that I announce the death of my mother, Joan Rivers.

‘She passed peacefully at 1:17pm surrounded by family and close friends. My son and I would like to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff of Mount Sinai Hospital for the amazing care they provided for my mother.

‘Cooper and I have found ourselves humbled by the outpouring of love, support, and prayers we have received from around the world. They have been heard and appreciated.

‘My mother’s greatest joy in life was to make people laugh. Although that is difficult to do right now, I know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon.’

A funeral for Joan Rivers will be held Sunday at Temple Emanu-El in New York City.
