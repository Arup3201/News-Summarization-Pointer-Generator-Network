Millionaire Tamara Ecclestone’s husband was robbed and beaten on a petrol station forecourt known as an area for drug-dealing, it emerged yesterday.

CCTV footage has been released of Jay Rutland being robbed of a £50,000 Rolex and £20,000 bracelet.

Mr Rutland was set upon by at least two thugs in a darkened area of the forecourt in Wanstead, East London, in an attack that left him battered and bruised on Wednesday.

The owner of the motor repairs business next to the garage said the spot had been used for drug deals in the past. Dave Dodds, 69, whose CCTV captured the fracas, said: ‘It’s a drug drop-off area  at night.

‘I’ve come back here late when I’ve forgotten something and found people here. I’ve even got video of a gun being handed over.’

The footage shows Mr Rutland, 32, drive to the forecourt in what appears to be a black Ferrari at 12.38am in the early hours of Wednesday, not a Range Rover as mentioned in previous reports.

The video also shows a figure searching the darkened ground with a torch minutes after the violent assault.

The attack took place in a poorly lit area at the entrance to the repairs  shop, behind the petrol station. Yesterday, blood still marked the road outside.

Mr Rutland, 32, said he was driving home when his fuel gauge started flashing, so he stopped at the petrol station, just off the A12.

He had gone to relieve himself in a corner when he was approached by two men who he claims threatened, assaulted and robbed him.

During the scuffle, one attacker dropped his phone. Mr Rutland picked it up and later handed it to police, which helped identify the owner.

Sammy Aibangee, 21, of Manor Park, East London, appeared in court on Friday accused of robbery and possession of a knife. He was remanded in custody.
