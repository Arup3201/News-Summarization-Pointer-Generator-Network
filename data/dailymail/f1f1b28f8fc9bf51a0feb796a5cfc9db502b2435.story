The latest documents from the National Security Agency leaked by Edward Snowden show that government spies are capable of listening in on mobile phone calls that use a common form of encryption.

The Washginton Post on published confidential government documents provided by Snowden that show that the NSA can 'process' cellular phone calls on GSM networks, even if they are encrypted.

Observers have long known that military and law enforcement officials are capable of hacking into a suspect’s mobile phone.

GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile communications, is the world's most widely used cellphone technology — though several large networks, notably Verizon and Sprint, rely on an older network technology called CDMA.

The cellphone encryption technology used most widely across the world can be easily defeated by the National Security Agency giving the agency the means to decode most of the billions of calls and texts that travel over public airwaves every day

Watching and listening: The agency’s ability to crack encryption used by the majority of cellphones in the world offers it wide-ranging powers to listen in on private conversations.

They're listening: U.S. law prohibits the NSA from collecting the content of conversations between Americans without a court order. If the NSA has the capacity to easily decode encrypted cellphone conversations, then other nations likely can do the same

Calls that have been encrypted according to a common standard called A5/1 — which was developed in 1987.

The
 vulnerability comes into play on 2G networks, which modern cellphones 
may resort to it when 3G or 4G networks are not available or too 
congested.

More modern networks like 3G and 4G, found throughout the US and other wealthy nations, are more difficult to decode.

The Post found that more than 80 percent of cell phones used in the world use outdated and vulnerable technology.

David
 Wagner, a computer scientist at the University of California Berkley, 
said that type of encryption 'was designed 30 years ago, and you 
wouldn’t expect a 30-year-old car to have the latest safety mechanisms.'

Experts
 suggest that while it takes longer for analysts to decode and examine 
messages sent on higher systems, it is indeed possible.

Some
 carriers are already making the change to the newer A5/3 method of 
encryption, however, it doesn't matter how strong  strong their 
encryption, the calls are automatically decoded upon reaching the 
carrier's internal network.

The
 NSA has repeatedly stated that it only snoops on conversations 
involving foreign citizens, as it has no legal basis by which to conduct
 such surveillance on Americans.

HQ: The NSA has been secretly collecting the phone call records of millions of Americans, using data provided by telecom firms AT&T and Verizon for years

Statement: Snowden had previously insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in America is logged

Current
 US law makes it illegal for the NSA to monitor phone conversations 
between American citizens without a court order, yet these documents 
reveal that the agency is capable of overriding encryption and listening
 in on international citizens.

The
 Post warned that the intelligence agencies of other nations likely have
 the same technology, and may even listen in on American phone calls.

This
 method of surveillance has made headlines recently because of the 
reported NSA tap on world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel.

'The
 scale of foreign surveillance has become so vast, the amount of 
information about Americans 'incidentally' captured may itself be 
approaching mass surveillance levels,'' said Elizabeth Goitein of the 
Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program.

'The
 government should be targeting its surveillance at those suspected of 
wrongdoing, not assembling massive associational databases that by their
 very nature record the movements of a huge number of innocent people,' 
said Catherine Crump, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties 
Union.
