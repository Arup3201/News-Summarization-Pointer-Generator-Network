Karrueche Tran has found herself at the centre of an uproar after making fun of Jay Z and Beyoncé's daughter, Blue Ivy.

Co-hosting Monday night's episode of 106 & Park, Chris Brown's model girlfriend took aim at the two-and-a-half-year-old's hair.

And the dig certainly didn't go down well with fans of the superstar couple, who were quick to slam the 26-year-old for the decidedly low blow against an innocent child.

Under fire: Karrueche Tran found herself at the centre of controversy during a guest-hosting gig on 106 & Park on Monday night after she joked about Jay Z and Beyoncé's infant daughter Blue Ivy's hair

During a segment with co-host Brandon Broady, the pair reflected on the previous evening's MTV VMAs, with Broady introducing 'the top six things Blue Ivy thought about the VMAs'.

Karrueche then delivered the line: 'I really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair.'

Obviously immediately regretting the scripted diss, she awkwardly giggled before adding: 'Sorry Blue, I love you!'

But it wasn't good enough for fans, who took to Twitter in their droves to call her out on the mean-spirited 'joke'.

'I really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair': The two-and-a-half-year-old, who appeared on stage with her famous parents during Sunday night's MTV VMAs, was the butt of a mean-spirited joke delivered by Tran

Low blow: The adorable little girl looked absolutely gorgeous with her hair worn in natural curls as she hit the stage in her father's arms to present her mom with the Vanguard Award

Twitter user @caitlynanala wrote: 'Karrueche Tran making fun of Blue Ivy's VMA hair is a testament to not only her irrelevance, but her desperation! Lmao.'

'The fact that BET had @karrueche throw a jab at blue ivy's hair on 106&park. & they wonder why they can't get Beyoncé to perform live,' commented @briiitea.

'As a human being w/ a brain, it's also a bit worrying that @Karrueche would bully 2-year-old Blue Ivy on @BET. You are not a puppet, right?' asked @KennethWareJr.

Attempting to defend herself, Karrueche hit back: 'Now y'all know I LOVE me some Beyoncé and Blue Ivy! I didn't write this script y'all lol,' later following it up with, 'I am definitely team #BeyHive.'

Rookie mistake: Chris Brown's 26-year-old girlfriend and co-host Brandon Broady's gag went down like a lead balloon, with the model giggling awkwardly before apologising, 'Sorry Blue, I love you!'

Script change: Karrueche was said to be mortified following the incident, with both she and her manager fuming that she was put in that situation, the punchline apparently having changed since earlier rehearsals

A source close to Tran tells TMZ she simply read the joke verbatim off the teleprompter, the script apparently having changed since rehearsals.

She insists she didn't see the joke beforehand and was mortified afterwards, with both she and her manager going 'nuclear' because they too felt the comment was in 'poor taste'.

Speaking to TMZ, Karrueche admitted she actually admires the child's hairstyle, saying: 'I love that Blue is able to wear her natural hair.'

BET President Stephen Hill also issued an apology via Twitter, in which he revealed that he had reached out to Beyoncé and Jay Z and is taking 'punitive actions' against the producers who put the guest host in that unfortunate position.

Hitting back: Tran attempted to defend herself, taking to Twitter following the show to explain that the gag was scripted and not her idea

Showing the love: She also made this comment as she insisted she's a huge fan of Blue's famous mom, Beyoncé

Over four messages he wrote: 'Last night on 106 & Park there was a stupid, unthoughtful joke made about a young child.

'We apologize publically to the child's parents (and have done so privately) and we have taken punitive actions with those responsible (sic).

'It was very bad judgment and we will serve you much better in the future.

'Oh, and please don't hate on Karrueche; it was NOT her fault. We also apologize to her for putting her in that position.'

BET is understood to have suspended a producer of the network's music video countdown show for the remark.
