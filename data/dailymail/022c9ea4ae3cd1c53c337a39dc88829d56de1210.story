This chart shows how much time internet users lose carrying out different offline activities in favour of spending time online

Sites including Facebook and Twitter are a procrastinator's dream, but new research has revealed the true extent of how these sites directly affect our lives.

Research conducted by the Technology Policy Institute in Washington has found that every hour spent online equates to, on average, 16 fewer minutes working.

The sites also affect our sleep - we lose seven minutes sleeping for each hour online; spend 17 minutes less outside in the real world and miss out on a staggering 18 days seeing friends.

For his paper, What we are not doing when we're online, economist and researcher from the institute, Scott Wallsten studied eight years of government data about Americans online from 2003 to 2011.

The act of replacing real-world time with online time is referred to by Wallsten as 'crowding out.'

Each minute of time spent online, according to Wallsten, directly correlates with 0.27 fewer minutes working, which over an hour equates to 16.2 minutes.

Over the course of a day, this adds up to 388.8 minutes, or around six and a half hours, which over a year means employers lose around 8 days a month.

Wallsten said: 'This research is a small step forward in understanding the economic effects of the Internet.

'The data clearly show that time spent and the share of the population engaged in online leisure isincreasing.

'The analyses suggest that new online activities come at least partly at the expense ofless time doing other activities.'

Over the course of five years, from 2006 to 2011, the amount of time people spend socialising with friends has dropped. For every minute people spend online, research claims they lose 0.05 minutes socialising, which works out at around 18 days each year

People watch 0.28 fewer minutes 
watching television, to each minute of online activity. This is 16.8 
minutes an hour, or almost 7 hours a day, on average.

Surfers
spend 0.12 fewer minutes sleeping and 0.05 fewer minutes socialising 
with friends. Over the course of a year, this means we lose 18 days 
seeing loved ones.

The trend also has an adverse affect on the eduction of young people, in particular, according to Wallsten's research.

The younger an internet user, the more time they spend online compared to studying and 'education-related tasks'.

People aged between 15 and 19 crowd out almost 0.3 minutes worth of studying in place of going online and using social networks. This is almost seven hours a day, on average.

Wallsten concluded that the loss of real-world time could have an affect on the economy but further research needs to be done into how damaging this could be.

According to research from Washington's Technology Policy Institute, browsing social networks including Facebook and Twitter is now the most common activity online, at 22.5 per cent. Online games are second. Videos and movies make up just 4.4 per cent
