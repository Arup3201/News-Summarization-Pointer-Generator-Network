A puppy which was forced to have his leg amputated after being found injured on a railroad track has been fitted with a prosthetic paw.

Hudson, a young pit bull, was fitted with the 'blade runner' limb after his paw became infected thanks to the ordeal of being dumped by his previous owner.

The man who dumped Hudson and two other puppies - one of which later died - was sentenced to six months in prison for animal cruelty.

Recovery: Hudson the pit bull puppy is pictured running around using his artificial paw

Plight: Hudson was abandoned by the railroad tracks in Albany, New York in September last year

Technology: He has been fitted with a 'blade runner' paw which allows him to run around again

The three dogs were found on the tracks in Albany, New York by a railroad worker in September this year, according to WNYT.

They were injured and starving having apparently been neglected before their abandonment, and one of the puppies was unable to survive the ordeal.

Another dog, Pearl, lost two toes to infection, while Hudson had to have his rear left paw amputated.

The puppy was adopted by the Nash family, and fitted with a prosthetic limb in November last year.

However, he eventually outgrew the artificial paw, and last week had to be fitted with a new one made by a specialist manufacturer.

Injury: The infection in Hudson's paw meant it had to be amputated so the illness did not spread

Replacement: Hudson was fitted with a prosthesis last November but has now grown out of it

Grateful: Hudson's new owner Richard Nash thanked well-wishers for their 'support and love'

The new limb includes a flexible blade which allows the dog to run around in comfort without putting too much pressure on the stump of his leg.

Derrick Campana, president of Animal Ortho Care based in Chantilly, Virginia, was so moved by Hudson's plight that he agreed to drive six hours to Albany and fit the new prosthesis himself.

He also measured the dog for a new one, as the one-year-old is likely to grow more and therefore need a new paw.

Callous: Anthony Walker was sentenced to six months in prison for abandoning Hudson

Found: Hudson was discovered along with two other dogs on this stretch of railroad track

Mr Campana did not charge the Nashes for the treatment, which would normally cost up to $700, saying: 'It's really nice to be able to see Hudson in person.'

'It means a lot to me and my family and I'm sure to Hudson,' owner Richard Nash told WNYT. 'The outpouring of support and love that people have for him is just amazing.'

Anthony Walker, who abandoned the dogs on the tracks and also left four other pets in a freezing truck, served a six-month prison service earlier this year, and has been banned from owning animals.
