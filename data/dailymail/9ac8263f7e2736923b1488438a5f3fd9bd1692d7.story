A man accused of killing a 15-year-old girl in a fake kidnapping that he planned to 'save' her from  is to go on trial today.

Kyle Dube, 21, of Orono, Maine, allegedly used a fake Facebook profile to set up a meeting with Nichole Cable in May 2013, but killed her in a botched kidnapping investigators say he had intended to 'solve himself'.

Police said Dube told people he planned to abduct Nichole while wearing a ski mask, return later without the mask, 'find' her and look like a hero.

Dube will appear in court today accused of creating the fake account to set up a meeting with Nichole, of Glenburn, before killing her and hiding her body on May 12, 2013.

Nichole's mother reported her missing on May 13 and told police her daughter had left the night before to meet a friend at the end of their road but had not returned

Dozens of law enforcement officers, using aircraft and dogs, and hundreds of civilian volunteers spent days searching for Nichole.

Her remains were found in Old Town on May 20, eight days after the abduction. 

The state's chief medical examiner found Nichole died as a result of asphyxiation.

Police said the fake Facebook profile Dube allegedly set up was under  a different name but was traced back to Dube's home.

Nichole Cable, aged 15, (pictured) was reported missing by her mother on May 13, who told police her daughter had left the night before to meet a friend at the end of their road but had not returned

The murder trial is expected to last two weeks.

Dube's defense has already received a setback - the judge in the case has said will not allow his attorneys to name his ex-girlfriend as an alternative suspect in the killing.

Defense attorneys wanted to name Dube's former girlfriend, who was dating Dube at the time of the killing, as an alternative suspect, saying the girl disliked Nichole because she believed Nichole and Dube were seeing each other.

But on Friday Superior Court Justice Ann Murray  granted the state's motion to exclude defense attorneys from naming another possible suspect.

The judge's order said that Dube 'set forth a tenuous suggestion of motive' in his call for the alternative suspect, but the defense's request 'does not reasonably establish any connection between' the girl and the crime.

She wrote that there was also no evidence that the girl was at or near Nichole's home on the night of Cable's disappearance, and that 'this trial must be the trial of Kyle Dube.' 

Nichole's father, David Cable, declined to comment on the trial but said: 'If you're a father, you know how I'm feeling right now.'

Her mother, Kristine Wiley, declined to comment.

Friends and classmates of Nichole Cable at Old Town High School said after Dube's arrest that they planned to reduce or end their use of social media. 

Nearly two years later, the school district continues to stress the importance of using social media safely and responsibly, said David Walker, superintendent of Regional School Unit 34, which includes the high school. 

However, he added he has not seen a dramatic change in the way students use social media at the school.

'Hopefully they recognize that the Internet isn't always a safe place,' Walker said. 

'Everyone is reminding students of the dangers, both parents and teachers.'

If convicted of kidnapping and murder, Dube could face between 25 years and life in prison.
