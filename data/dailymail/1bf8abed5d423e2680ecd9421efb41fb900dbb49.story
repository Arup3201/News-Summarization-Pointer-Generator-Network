A grandmother, who reported to police that her handbag had been stolen and then was arrested herself - over an unpaid parking ticket dating back to 1992, has received an official apology from Queensland police.

Dorothy Deshong rang police in Cairns, northern Queensland, after she was broken into and her bag, which contained a diamond ring, was taken.

But instead of helping her getting her treasured item back, Ms Deshong says she was treated like a criminal and put in the back of a paddy wagon and taken to the police station after officers discovered she had not paid an old fine from when she was a student in Townsville.

Ms Deshong said she was annoyed and embarrassed at being led to the police van as her neighbours and grandchildren's schoolfriends watched on and demanded an apology from Queensland police.

While at the police station Ms Deshong was forced to call her daughter to make sure she paid the fine - now $131 - or risk being locked up overnight.

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal service offered to represent her.

Lawyer Greg Shadbolt told NITV News he believed legislation changes should be made, and in a case like this, police should show some discretion.

Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'Police have an obligation to act on an existing warrant which may relate to various outstanding warrants.

'Police are reviewing the circumstances surrounding this particular incident.'

But following an investigation into the matter, it was revealed that due to a legislative change, police now do not have the authority to make an arrest on such unique warrants.

In addition, she will be reimbursed some money paid, due to a miscalculation of the outstanding debt.
