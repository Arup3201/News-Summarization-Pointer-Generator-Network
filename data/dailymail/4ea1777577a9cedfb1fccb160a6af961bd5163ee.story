The boyfriend of Anna Wintour allegedly owes more than $1.2million to the U.S. government, according to reports.

J. Shelby Bryan, 66, of Texas, has been dating the British-born Vogue editor-in-chief since 1999. And the revelation could derail Ms Wintour's bid to become U.S. ambassador to Britain.

Mr Bryan was a top fundraiser for Bill Clinton in the 1990s, and even served on the former President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

With Wintour, the couple helped bring in millions of dollars for President Obama's re-election war chest last year.

But despite raising money for Mr Obama it was revealed that Mr Bryan has owed money to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since 2006, according to court filings obtained by The Daily Telegraph.

He was in the process of paying back $1.6million in property taxes due in Harris County, Texas, and has since paid 
back about $400,000, according to the report.

In 2010 Mr Bryan was also pursued for about $20,000 in overdue property taxes, records show.

Mr Bryan had $30million after divorcing his second
wife Katherine in 1999 to pursue a relationship with Ms Wintour.

But he lost a great deal of his fortune during the recession.

Mr Bryan told the Telegraph: 'I've paid Harris County so much money in so many taxes, and that's the only time it went awry.

'I mean it was my fault, you know people in the office weren't doing their job - but it was kind of an exceptional situation.'

He claimed he was 'on schedule' with his payments to the IRS and hadn't paid the full bill immediately, because he 'didn't have the cash'.

Vogue did not comment when contacted by the New York Post's Page Six.

Ms Wintour is under consideration for the role of U.S. ambassador but would need the President's nomination.

Louis Susman, the current Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, was appointed in 2009 but has said that he will step down from the post.

But Mr Bryan's alleged tax woes could put her chances in jeopardy.

He grabbed headlines last month when he suggested the Old Boys' Club of politics
is unwilling to let the British-born publishing maven into their ranks 
despite her business acumen and successful fundraising efforts for Obama.

The Vogue editor was born in London, a 
daughter of Charles Wintour who edited the London Evening 
Standard.

The
fashion queen became a U.S. citizen and has been active in politics and an ardent supporter of Mr Obama's, including holding a $35,000 a head fundraising dinner in August. In his speech Mr Obama thanked 'Anna and Shelby for being such extraordinary hosts'.

She also championed an Obama fundraiser at Paris 
Fashion Week and was among the hosts at a London party for the 
Democrat.

The head of the Condé Nast 
publication also enlisted her celebrated designer friends to create 
Obama-themed paraphernalia, for the Runway to Win campaign, so supporters could fashionably show their support for the president. The effort raised $40 million.

With her long-list of political good 
deeds, alongside her business CV of running a multimillion-dollar 
magazine, Bryan says it is unfair that the media exec, dubbed 'Nuclear Wintour,' is not being given due credit based on her merits.

‘It’s a little bit of male chauvinism,’ he said.

‘It’s
not just Anna - I see powerful women who really get slammed for being 
too forthright or running their business in a very determine way.’

'I think she would do a great job if 
it ever happened, but I’m not expecting it to happen,' Bryan said about 
the reports, adding that she already has a good gig going.

'She has a great job at Vogue that she loves very much. So I don’t know about that.'
