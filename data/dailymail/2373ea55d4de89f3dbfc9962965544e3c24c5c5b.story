A high school student has revealed how a 'sex-crazed' cross-dressing teacher allegedly took her to nude beaches, sex clubs and luxury hotels during a relationship where he would routinely exploit her.

The girl, described only as V.V, said Brooklyn Tech faculty member Sean Shaynak flashed her as they walked to the subway after school and 'plied her with alcohol' during a visit to New York's sex museum.

The youngster, who was 18 at the time of the alleged assaults, also said she was forced to 'pray for her life' as she hid in the bushes during a terrifying date with the 44-year-old, who was dressed in drag and screaming 'b****' as he looked for her.

During their relationship the father-of-one also took V.V. to a nude section of Jones Beach on Long Island, multiple 'rave clubs,' and X-rated venues where the girl would allegedly watch him 'perform and receive (sex acts) with other males.'

A lawsuit seen by the New York Post accused Shaynak of exploiting the girl for his own 'sexual gratification' in a relationship that began when they met at an after-school Aerospace Club.

The teacher, who was there when Bill De Blasio's son Dante was a student, is now facing 36 charges from his time at the school, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal sexual acts against six girls between 2011 and 2014.

Busted: Teacher Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly took advantage of naive young girls as he victimized students before he was finally busted when he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old student and she showed the photograph to her parents who reported him to the police

According to court documents, Shaynak convinced V.V to go to a DJ party at the Amazura concert hall in Jamaica, Queens.

He picked her up at the school, wearing a schoolgirl costume with women's underwear, high-heels and tights.

On the way to the venue, the two began arguing about their relationship and Shaynak started yelling in a threatening tone, the lawsuit says.  

Suddenly, Shaynak stopped the car, turned around, and drove in the opposite direction and allegedly started speeding and driving recklessly through the traffic while 'banging on the steering wheel'. 

V.V. 'began silently praying for her life while trying to figure out a way to escape.' Shaynak began 'banging on the steering wheel.'

Finally, he stopped the car in a dark parking lot in Coney Island, to get out and urinate.

The girl then took the opportunity to 'save herself,' by getting out of the car and crawling behind another vehicle to hide.

While searching for her, Shaynak shouted 'b****.' She cowered in bushes for up to 40 minutes while Shaynak called and text-messaged her dozens of times, threatening to go to her house and speak to her parents, a lawsuit said. 

In a statement about Syanak, V.V. who is now a college student said: 'As a teacher, he was very cool to hang out with and talk to. I could totally understand how the other girls could look up to him.

'I feel like I was used. If I had a chance to sit down and talk to him, I would tell him that what he did was sick and he should have stopped when I told him to stop.' 

Shaynak has pleaded not guilty and remains jailed in Rikers Island. His lawyer, Kimberly Ann Summers, had no comment but in a recent hearing claimed some of the alleged victims 'continue to speak highly of Shaynak.

Another student allegedly victimized by Shaynak teacher had lingering affections for him even after he assaulted her, says her heartsick mother.

The mother, who remains anonymous as does her daughter, says Shaynak knew the naive girl had fallen for him, a trust he was happy to exploit.  

'Sick': Sean Shaynak, 44, allegedly had sex with multiple students at the school where he taught, sent them explicit messages and took them to nude beaches and sex clubs. He has pleaded not guilty

In an interview with The New York Post the mother says he would give her daughter perfect grades even if she turned in unfinished work.

'I raised my children to trust people - but it looks like you can't,' she said.

Her daughter, who graduated from high school last year, is now 19, and studying criminal justice in college. 

She says her first suspicions about Shaynak's appetites came last year when she found him with several bikini-clad female students, her daughter included.

He even had his own revealing swimwear.

'The thing that surprised me was the way he laid on the beach,' she said. 'You could see ...everything.'

The group was gossiping about sex, with Shaynak holding court about his taste for Russian girls, which her daughter happened to be. 

'He was talking about how beautiful Russian girls are and how sexy they are,' the mother said. 'It was scary.

'It was noticeable the way he looked at them and got excited, like he wants somebody, you could tell..' she said. 'When you see a girl and get horny - that's what he was like.' 

Her daughter later expressed that she had a crush on Shaynak.

'She said, 'Isn't he cute?' I said, 'Yes, he's cute as a man,'' the woman said. 'She said, 'I kind of like him.''

He had allegedly sodomized the girl months earlier in May. 

'The judgement for him should be high,' the woman said. 'Because it's children...and it could affect them for the rest of their life. I don't believe he will change.

'He should definitely go to prison for the rest of his life.' 

On the day after school ended in June, instructor Sean Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his privates to her cell phone via Snapchat, the girl's angered father told The New York Daily News.

The charges in the new indictment include kidnapping, forcible touching, sexual abuse and criminal sexual act. Shaynak faces up to 25 years in prison on the top charge, authorities said.

Shaynak, 44, pleaded not guilty in August to charges including dissemination of indecent material to a minor. Authorities say he sent a photo of his genitals to a 16-year-old female student.

Authorities said on Tuesday that computers and phones taken after his arrest found text messages, photos and videos detailing sexual interactions with six teens, from ages 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014. 

Exclusive: He taught for five years at Brooklyn Technical High School, where Bill de Blasio's son attends school. Shaynak allegedly had relationships with girls ranging in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014

Those interactions included taking a 15-year-old girl to a nude beach and giving alcohol and cigarettes to minors, officials said.

'These alleged actions are completely unacceptable and have no place in, or outside of, our schools,' City Department of Education spokeswoman Devora Kaye said.

 'The DOE took swift action to immediately reassign Mr. Shaynak following his initial arrest. He is not, and will not be, in contact with students. Student safety remains our top priority.'

Brooklyn Tech is one of the most selective high schools in the city. 

The teacher had allegedly been trying to lure the most recent 16-year-old student who came forward with the text message into an inappropriate relationship for two years.

He was considered a 'cool teacher' because he offered to buy her cigarettes. 

The girl's father said that he also offered to take his daughter to the park and once asked her to pose for him in a project.

'He asked her to pose for him for some kind of a project, and she declined,' the furious father told The New York Daily News on Thursday.

'He wanted to take her to the park. ... We later learned he would buy her cigarettes.'

Finally when Shaynak allegedly sent the girl a picture of his crotch, she reported the incident to her parents.

The girl's father had a friend in the FBI and they immediately reached out to police.

'It was immediate outrage on my part, 'said her father.

'You can imagine we're all very shaken up and extremely concerned.'

The girl took the stand against the teacher two months ago and spoke before a Brooklyn grand jury.

He said that while his daughter is strong she is hurt by the incident and it has rattled her trust.

'She likes to play that she's strong and tough ... but then she's my little (girl) all over again asking for my help,' the dad said.

'The main concern is that this guy is off the street and that he stays behind bars and and doesn't have any access to kids.' 

Sean Shaynak is a divorced dad-of-one who taught math and physics at Brooklyn Technical High School, which is attended by Mayor Bill de Blasio's son Dante.

During the investigation into that claim, authorities searched his home, computers and phones and allegedly unearthed thousands of inappropriate text messages, photographs and videos. 

They allegedly learned that he had had relations with six students, who ranged in age from 13 to 19, between 2011 and 2014, NBC New York reported.

'The defendant, clearly from his actions, looked to groom these students,' assistant district attorney Joseph Mancino said in Brooklyn Supreme Court, the New York Daily News reported.

He took one 15-year-old girl to a nude beach in New Jersey without her parents' permission and he also took her to his home, where he plied her with alcohol until she passed out, Mancino said.

Shaynak also asked the girl to take part in lesbian sex with another student, prosecutors claim.

During a relationship with another girl, he allegedly watched her have sex with other people at a sex club.
