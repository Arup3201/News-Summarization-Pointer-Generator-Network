Thousands of migrants are exploiting lax EU rules to bring their families and spouses to Britain by the back door.

Foreign nationals from outside Europe who would be unlikely to gain a visa to live or work in the UK are instead applying for citizenship elsewhere in the EU.

Under Brussels rules, they can then move to Britain and apply for permission to bring in their spouse or children.

'Growing problem': Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine has warned that non-Europeans were using Brussels' free movement rules to get into the UK

Now a damning report by an immigration watchdog has found that the system is suffering ‘significant abuse’ at the hands of migrants who falsely claim they are related or married to a non-European living in the UK.

Yesterday, Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration John Vine called it a ‘growing problem’.

He said: ‘Our findings suggest the European citizenship route is becoming an increasingly important way into the UK for those whose origins lie outside the EEA [European Economic Area], particularly now that the immigration rules have been tightened.’ The report looked at more than 100 sample cases from the Home Office between April and September last year.

It found that more than a third of Western European nationals – 36 per cent – who were applying for citizenship for their partner were born in Africa, Asia or South America and had gained European citizenship before arriving in Britain.

David Cameron vowed to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year, but is failing because of the soaring number of Europeans moving to the UK

In
 a quarter of cases the ‘sponsors’ – whose new nationalities included 
German, Italian and Spanish – were born in the same non-EU country as 
their partner.

In one case, a migrant who acquired Italian 
nationality before then moving to the UK received 97 per cent of his 
income from welfare handouts. Some 60 per cent of those applying for 
citizenship for a  so-called spouse last year failed because immigration
 officials feared the relationship was fake – but thousands still slip 
through the net.

Some had taken part in a sham marriage while in the 
UK and others claimed they had been wed by proxy, where a couple remain 
in Britain and both are represented at an overseas wedding ceremony, 
usually by family members. Most proxy marriages were found to be 
invalid, according to the report.

It found that there is also a 
problem with Eastern European women moving to the UK and applying for 
citizenship for men they had supposedly married, mainly from Nigeria, 
Ghana and Pakistan.

Mr Vine said there had been ‘significant 
attempted abuse by non-EEA nationals applying on the basis of marriage 
or civil partnership with a European citizen’.

He added: ‘If the 
Home Office does not act decisively to identify and tackle these abuses,
 many of the individuals involved may go on to obtain settlement in the 
UK on the basis of relationships that are not genuine.’ Inspectors found
 that in some cases where there was suspicion of a sham marriage, the 
culprits were not properly investigated. The report added that the Home 
Office targeted sham marriage and trafficking by organised crime gangs, 
but prosecuted fewer individuals.

Home Affairs Select Committee 
chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘I am deeply concerned by these findings. It is
 vital that all applications for admission to this country are subjected
 to appropriate levels of scrutiny. We have seen during the passport 
crisis that standards of scrutiny for applications should never be 
lowered.’

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘It is 
clear that after four years in office Theresa May just hasn’t got a grip
 on sham marriages.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are taking 
ever tougher action to crack down on those who try to cheat our 
immigration system by abusing marriage laws and we are pleased the Chief
 Inspector has praised our robust approach to identifying sham 
marriages. Last year, we intervened in more than 1,300 sham marriages – 
more than double that of the previous year.’
