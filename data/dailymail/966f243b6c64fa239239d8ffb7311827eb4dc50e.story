A lawyer for the Leveson Inquiry who had an affair with Hugh Grant’s barrister played a significant role in the inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson admitted last night.

The judge had initially suggested that Carine Patry Hoskins played only a minor role in his inquiry, carrying out work that was ‘largely mechanical’.

But, following revelations that she was paid £218,000 for her work between July 2011 and November 2012, he came under pressure to reveal more about her role.

member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team,  claim their relationship 
did not start until after the inquiry

In a letter to the Tory MP Rob Wilson, 
the judge said she had also played a key role in drawing up lines of 
questioning used by the inquiry’s lead counsel Robert Jay, as well as 
questioning witnesses herself, reviewing witness statements and 
researching areas of the law.

However the letter said nothing about her role in drawing up the so-called Rule 13 letters outlining the inquiry’s criticisms of the Press before the report was published.

Lord Justice Leveson insists the conclusions of his report were his alone.

But Mr Wilson said the revelations would underline public concern about whether the Leveson Inquiry’s findings could have been compromised by an affair between Miss Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, and David Sherbourne, a barrister representing Mr Grant and other celebrities campaigning for regulation of the Press.

Miss Patry Hoskins, who became known as the ‘woman on the left’ during the televised hearings, was junior counsel in the team led by  Mr Jay.

She went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Mr Sherbourne in August last year – while the inquiry was being conducted.

The pair claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’.

They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in December.

Mr Wilson said: ‘We now learn that Carine Patry Hoskins did indeed  provide important legal advice to the Leveson Inquiry, and dealt with  witnesses and made assessments of the evidence on behalf of the inquiry. This must have had some bearing on the inquiry’s work, whether she had a formal input into the drafting of the report or not.

‘It would be completely inappropriate for someone to carry out these important tasks for an impartial public inquiry while developing such close personal relations with one of the parties’ barristers to the point that they went on holiday together to contemplate an affair.

‘I am very surprised that Lord Justice Leveson has not already taken the many opportunities available to him to make this clear.’ 

In his latest letter, Lord Leveson again denied that Miss Patry Hoskins influenced his final report. He said she had ‘no input into the conclusions or recommendations in the report itself’.

In April last year Miss Patry Hoskins told people at the inquiry she was helping to draft the Rule 13 letters, which set out criticisms of the Press across 120 pages that appeared largely unchanged in the final report later in the year.

The letters were sent to newspaper editors in mid-August, when Miss Patry Hoskins claims she was contemplating an affair with Mr Sherbourne.

Lord Justice Leveson’s latest letter makes no reference to her work in this area, focusing on her work in the early stages of the inquiry.

He has previously said she merely ‘assisted in the largely mechanical exercise of collecting and organising the evidence to support the generic criticisms’ set out in the letters.
