A commuter who was taken ill on a packed train while five months pregnant was forced to sit on the floor because none of her fellow passengers would give up their seats.

Victoria Poskitt, 40, has hit out at train bosses for not allowing her to sit in first class after she felt woozy on a morning service from Surbiton in south west London to Waterloo.

She said rail firm South West Trains - which does grant 'pregnancy passes' to women but only if they are more than 20 weeks pregnant and have a season ticket - told her 'policy is policy' and she should have found a guard or pulled the emergency cord if she felt ill.

Mrs Poskitt, who works as the head of communications at the teachers' union the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, attacked the incivility of her fellow passengers in an interview with the Evening Standard.

'Simple human decency should have prevailed,' she said.

She added: 'I thought [South West Trains] might be willing to make an exception, particularly after I told them about what happened, but after conversations with various managers they’ve flatly said "no", saying policy is policy.

'I don’t honestly know [what to do next]. I keep trying with South West Trains, I’m throwing myself at their mercy because they could make all the difference to the last few months of my pregnancy.'

Over the last 12 months South West Trains has handed out 575 upgrade tickets to pregnant women.

They allow the women to sit in first class, but because Mrs Poskitt does not have a season ticket as she only works in central London three days a week, she was not eligible for one.

A spokesman for the South West Trains Network Rail Alliance told MailOnline: 'We are sorry to hear that Ms Poskitt felt unwell recently on one of our services.

'We have the most extensive upgrade scheme of any rail operator to help our customers who are expecting a baby. This provides first class upgrades to women travelling with valid weekly, monthly or annual South West Trains season tickets whenever standard class seating is not available. It covers pregnant women who are within 20 weeks of their due delivery date.

'For customers who travel less frequently, we have priority seats available on our services similar to the system on the London Underground.

'We also provide mums-to-be with badges to highlight that they should be given a seat whenever possible and we have offered this to Ms Poskitt.

'As on other forms of transport, our experience is that fellow passengers will give up their seat for mums-to-be and other customers such as elderly people and we are sorry and surprised this did not happen.'

MailOnline contacted Mrs Poskitt but she was unavailable to comment further.
