A man has claimed that his best friend confessed to him that he was the infamous Zodiac Killer who terrorized California throughout the 1960s.

Randy Kenney, from New York, said that before his friend Louise Myers passed away he claimed to be responsible for the five murders linked to the Zodiac Killer between 1968 and 1969.

Myers claimed that, aged 17, he had targeted young couples - some of whom he went to school or worked with - because he was bitter that his girlfriend had broken up with him.

Kenney said Myers made the confession in April 2001 after doctors told him he was dying
 from cirrhosis of the liver but that Myers asked him to wait to tell authorities until 
after he had died.

Did he do it? Louie Myers, pictured in high school in the 60s, told a friend he was the Zodiac Killer, who killed five people in California. Myers, who died in 2002, told his friend to wait until his death before telling police

He added that he wanted Kenney to write a 
book with the proceeds going to the victims' families, ABC7's I-Team reported.

Myers passed away in May 2002 and Kenney claimed that he has spent years since trying to get police to listen. They have now added Myers' name to their list of suspects.

Kenney said Myers told him: 'I killed 
some people. I'm the guy they're looking for. They've been looking for 
me for over 30 years. I'm the guy that's The Zodiac Killer.'

Kenney said: 'I really, truly feel that Louie was 100 percent honest with me that day.'

Another friend, Bob Robitaille, said that Myers had also confessed to him but that he had dismissed it as not being true.

Claims: Randy Kenney, Myers' best friend, claimed Myers had targeted young couples after being dumped

Disbelief: Friend Bob Robitaille, left, said Myers, right, also told him he was the killer but he didn't believe him

Shock: Robitaille, pictured today, said when Myers made the claim in 1976, he brushed it off as lies

The Zodiac Killer had claimed through a series of cryptic letters - which were signed with the zodiac sign and sent to local newspapers - that he was responsible for 37 deaths in the San Francisco Bay area, but police have pinned just five on him.

In December 1968, he forced two teenagers in Benicia out of their car before shooting them. In July 1969, a couple was shot while parked in Vallejo, although the male victim survived.

Then in September 1969, a masked man stabbed two people at Lake Berryessa in Napa County, again killing one of them, and in October of that year,Â  a San Francisco cab driver was shot dead.

Speaking to ABC7, Kenney said that Myers had claimed he had targeted young couples because his girlfriend had broken up with him, but that the taxi driver had been killed simply for drug money.

Kenney added that the zodiac sign on the 
letters wasn't actually a zodiac sign at all, but a Celtic cross because
 Myers was obsessed with Celtic culture.

Did he do it? After high school, Myers got in trouble with the law (left) for charges including theft. Authorities said he does not look anything like the suspect sketch put together by witness statements (right)

Links? As well as going to school with 2 of the victims and working with another, Myers also worked at this Army Navy store, which could explain the large military boot-print found at one crime scene

Some of the facts appear to add up, ABC7 reported.

Myers, who lived in Vallejo from 1965 to 1971, went to two different schools, at which he met two of his victims, David Farraday and Betty Lou Jensen, who died in separate killings.

Kenney also worked at Terry's restaurant in Vallejo, where he met another victim, Darlene Ferrin.

He said that there was another connection - a military-style boot print found at one crime scene. Myers could have had access to such boots while working at 
Victory Military Surplus in Vallejo.

After the murders, Myers was arrested on other charges, including disorderly conduct, theft and possession of stolen property. To stay out of trouble, he joined the Army.

Military
 records show Myers was stationed in Germany between 1971 and 1973, a 
time when authorities received no letters from the Zodiac Killer.

Connections: He was at school with victim Betty Lou Jensen (left) and worked with Darlene Ferrin (right)

Looking for answers: Homicide inspectors David Toschi, left, and William Armstrong are pictured in 1974 going through a murder victim's clothes at the morgue. The killer was never caught

Afterwards, he moved to New York to become a truck driver. He would often visit San Francisco and during one trip in 1976, he told childhood friend Bob Robitaille that he was the killer.

Investigators said they were skeptical that a teenager would have been capable of the killings and said that Myers' picture looks nothing like a sketch put together through witness reports.

But they are still pursuing the tip. In total, they have investigated and cleared more than 2,500 suspects. Now they receive around one tip a week.

In 2012, Lyndon Lafferty, who was a childhood friend of one of the main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen, said he believed the killer was a 91-year-old man living in California.
