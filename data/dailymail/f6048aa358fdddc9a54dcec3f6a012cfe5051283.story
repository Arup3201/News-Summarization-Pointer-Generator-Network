Lovechild? Georgina Ray has claimed to be the daughter of Sir Jimmy Savile and has said she will take a DNA test to prove it

A divorcee who has sensationally claimed to be the secret love child of Sir Jimmy Savile says she is not after a share of his fortune.

Georgina Ray, 40, says her mother had a brief fling with the TV star while working as a waitress in the 1970s.

Now she is seeking a DNA test to prove she is Sir Jimmy’s daughter.

Blonde Mrs Ray, who bears a striking resemblance to the late presenter, is understood to have told lawyers that she is ‘not after any money’.

But last night one of her relatives said it was ‘obvious’ she wanted a share of Sir Jimmy’s £2.5million estate.

Her cousin Sarah McLaran branded her ‘a gold-digger,’ adding: ‘If she’s not after any money, why didn’t she say anything while he was still alive?

‘It’s obvious she’s doing it for the money. That’s just what she’s like.

‘She’s been having a few money problems since her divorce a couple of years ago. She probably thinks she can get some money out of this.’

Merchandise representative Mrs Ray was born after her mother had a two-week fling with the DJ, a well-known womaniser who died in October aged 84.

At the time of the affair, her mother Christine Oakes was 19 and working as a waitress in a greasy spoon cafe off the A5 in Cannock, Staffordshire.

She is said to have been ‘awestruck’ when the Top Of The Pops host walked in to the cafe, ordering six eggs sunny side up and two mugs of tea.

Sir Jimmy is said to have later ‘carried Christine out of the cafe caveman-style’ and taken her to his camper van.

Their
 affair was over in only two weeks. But nine months later, Christine – 
who now uses her married name Rumford – gave birth to Georgina.

Mrs McLaran said: ‘Christine never actually told me that story about Jimmy, but we all knew that he was Georgina’s dad.

‘I do think Georgina is his, the resemblance is striking. It’s her eyes, her nose, her smile – everything. It’s obvious  she’s Jimmy’s.’

A friend claimed that when Georgina was at school other children there learned who her father was and would tease her by repeating his catchphrases such as ‘Now then, now then’.

Christine, now 59, is said to have told her daughter when she was seven years old that Sir Jimmy was her father but forbade her from contacting him.

Mrs Ray is understood to have obeyed 
her mother’s request until two years ago, when following a difficult 
divorce from her husband Ian she decided to write a letter to the TV 
star revealing that she was his daughter.

After receiving no response she is said to have travelled to his luxury flat in Leeds to confront him.

But the ageing DJ is said to have spoken to her over the intercom pretending to be someone else, saying: ‘He’s away.’ He then refused to come to the door.

Friends also say that Mrs Ray travelled to Leeds to see Sir Jimmy’s coffin, which was put on display in a hotel for three days after his death in October.

They say she nearly blurted out that she was his daughter there and then, but decided not to  say anything.

The claims first appeared in yesterday’s edition of The Sun. A friend told how Mrs Ray had contacted lawyers to arrange a DNA test on a strand of his famous blond hair taken from his apartment which she is convinced will prove she is his daughter.

However, the paper said she was adamant that she does not want any of the star’s cash, with friends insisting she simply wants ‘the truth to be acknowledged’.

But her cousin dismissed those claims as ‘a load of rubbish’.

Mrs McLaran added: ‘Georgina’s never mentioned wanting to meet her father before. I didn’t think she was interested.

‘Now suddenly she is saying she wants to know the truth, and it’s not about the money. I just don’t believe it.’

She said Mrs Ray also showed a ‘sudden interest’ in her mother’s stepfather, Trevor Gough, after he died – despite never speaking to him while he was alive.

‘She was exactly the same then,’ Mrs McLaran said. ‘She was never bothered about seeing him, she was too stuck up.

‘Then when he died, it was Trevor this, Trevor that. Suddenly she wanted to know all about the will. It was obvious what she was after.’

Sir Jimmy’s will has not yet been published, but it has already been announced that his estate will fund a new ‘Savile Institute’ in Leeds devoted to helping heart disease patients.

The DJ’s family and friends were said to be stunned by Mrs Ray’s love child claim. Sir Jimmy’s nephew Roger Foster said: ‘I was absolutely gobsmacked when I heard about this.

‘Why would someone wait decades before coming forward and saying Jimmy was her dad?

‘I don’t know how much credence I would give her claims. It would be fair to say I’m quite sceptical about them.’

He added that despite his uncle’s ‘vast’ wealth, he did not believe much of it was likely to be left to family anyway.

‘He only ever gave money away to charitable causes – that was the nature of the man,’ Mr Foster said.

‘His will is being handled by bank executors and we don’t know the contents of it yet.

‘But I imagine that however close a relation she is, a will is a will – and if she’s not in it, she’s unlikely to get any money.’

Mrs Ray claimed she had tried to contact Sir Jimmy but to no avail. She visited his coffin at the Queen's Hotel in Leeds after his death

Sir Jimmy was buried in Scarborough last month following three days of remembrance when his coffin was on display in the Leeds hotel; 5,000 people paid their respects.

He was laid to rest wearing one of his trademark tracksuits and with three large cigars, and the coffin was angled at 45 degrees because he wanted to ‘see the sea’.

Georgina Ray yesterday refused to come to the door of her three-bedroom semi-detached house in Cannock, Staffordshire. A woman at her address said: ‘She doesn’t want to comment on anything. She’s not interested.’

Christine Rumford, her mother, also refused to answer the door  at her home nearby. A woman at her bungalow, who said she  was one of her sisters, said she was feeling unwell and did not wish to comment.

Mrs Ray is not the first person to claim a secret connection with Sir Jimmy. After his death, 61-year old divorcee Sue Hymns said they had been secret lovers for 43 years – and that their on-off relationship lasted from 1968 until his death.

Miss Hymns, a former PA, claims he told her that marriage and children ‘would never work’ because of his hectic showbusiness lifestyle. She has also said that his first words to her were: ‘Now then, now then.’

Sir Jimmy Savile left more than £5million to charities when he died in October, two  days before his 85th birthday, it  emerged yesterday.

But during his lifetime, the generous  presenter is thought to have donated around £45million to charity from his money-raising efforts.

His two charity accounts – Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust and the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust – contained a combined £5.2million on his death.

Sir Jimmy helped to establish and fund the National Spinal Injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, initially raising about £20m

His devotion to charitable works earned him a knighthood in 1990.

The TV legend had also amassed a personal fortune estimated to be worth at least £2.5million, including  five homes.

His string of properties included a penthouse flat overlooking Roundhay Park in Leeds, a picturesque cottage in Glencoe, Scotland, a flat in central London, and a home in Bournemouth.

Sir Jimmy, who received royalties from shows such as Jim’ll Fix It, which he created, also received around £10,000 a time from public appearances.

The executors of his will, a bank, are currently collating his assets and possessions. The details of the will are yet to  be announced.

But his family yesterday said that they expected very little would be left to them. They said his motto was: ‘You get what you work for’ – and he preferred to give his wealth to good causes than dish it out to family members.
