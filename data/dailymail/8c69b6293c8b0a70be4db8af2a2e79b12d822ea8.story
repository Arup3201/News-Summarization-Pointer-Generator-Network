It’s hard to recall a bowling performance as complete as that from England. 

Sure, it was a good toss to win and conditions were ideal. But they barely put a foot wrong until they allowed MS Dhoni and Ishant Sharma to scrape together a few for the last wicket. 

Even that, though, only took India to 148.

It was important that Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan backed up the two big guns. Woakes has bowled pretty well in this series without much luck, while Jordan has been short of rhythm.

But it was clear that Alastair Cook now has more faith in them, just as he’s developed faith in Moeen Ali. For maybe the first time, the captain wasn’t trying to make sure that one of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad was always bowling.

Cook hasn’t suddenly become a brilliant captain because his seamers are bowling well, just as he wasn’t a dreadful captain when they were struggling earlier in the summer. 

But he’ll be quietly excited about the mood around this team.

Waiting in the wings are Steven Finn and Liam Plunkett, while next off the batting rank are guys like Alex Hales, James Vince, James Taylor and — in limited-overs cricket — Jason Roy. Samit Patel’s in the mix too. 

When you look at where they’ve come from, it’s quite an effort. Losing 5-0 in Australia, the home defeat by Sri Lanka, then going 1-0 down to India. 

The whole team deserves a lot of credit. But the two men Cook owes most to are Anderson and Broad. In a gruelling five-Test series, they’ve been the guys who have come through and kept up the pressure on the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli.

Technique: Anderson (pictured) and Broad are the two men who captain Alastair Cook can thank the most

Fit: In a gruelling five-Test series, Anderson (pictured) and Broad have been the guys who have kept up

The fact that those two keep making the same mistakes is down to the pressure exerted by England’s new-ball bowlers. 

Pujara was bowled by another Broad nip-backer, while Kohli has forgotten where his off stump is, mainly thanks to the working over Anderson has given him.

As for India, their batsmen look mentally shot — with the exception of Dhoni. He came in for a bit of criticism after taking Wednesday off to go shooting, but obviously a sense of perspective helps a bloke like him who has so much on his plate. 

A few of his team-mates could maybe do with something similar.

Bowler: Broad may require knee surgery after this Test but looked to keep up his high intensity on Friday

Celebrate: Broad has helped revive Cook's captaincy with his fine form against India throughout the series

Alastair Cook has not become a brilliant captain because his seamers are bowling well - he was not dreadful  when they were struggling either
