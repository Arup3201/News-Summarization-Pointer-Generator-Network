The RAC is to launch a device that will warn motorists about faults in their cars before they break down.

The matchbox-sized device, called the RAC Advance, transmits data about the car before and after every journey by slotting slots into a car's computer system.

The automated system means that 
drivers then receive a phone call, text or email telling them there's a 
fault with their car.

Pioneering: The RAC Advance gathers data on a vehicle by slotting into a socket beside the steering column and using 3G technology

If the car breaks down or has an accident it will automatically alert an RAC breakdown team with the vehicle's location and details of the problem.

The miniscule device slots into a scart socket beside the steering column, where mechanics and technicians connect diagnostic equipment.

It can then detect engine and gearbox problems, monitor imminent battery failure, battery drain and alternator problems.

The device also checks for brake wear, throttle problems and whether the diesel filters have become clogged.

Motorsists will be able to access data on their car remotely, using a mobile, tablet or PC.

The early warning system builds on current telematics technology that utilises 3G connectivity.

Information: The device records information about the car's performance to RAC before and after every journey and will automatically alert RAC staff if the car breaks down with its location

Miniscule: The tiny device, which will be available to all RAC members in 2013, is only the size of a matchbox

If an RAC team is contacted with a problem they can access the onboard diagnostic software remotely to identify the fault.

It will also act as an instant alert to the rescue service in the event of a serious accident - providing a record of time and location record for the motorist.

All of the RAC's 1,700 patrol vehicles have already been fitted with first generation devices and more than 35,000 fleet vehicles in the UK are using it.

The device will be available to RAC members during 2013, with its price added on to subscription charges.

Quick response: When a customer breaks down RAC staff will be able to determine a vehicle's whereabouts and gather information about the problem before they respond

RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'Offering peace of mind in a box, RAC Advance will revolutionise how we deal with our members.

'Some breakdowns can be avoided with a preemptive warning and intervention and this will significantly advance how we are able to deal with a breakdown or accident.

'With an accurate fault diagnosis and vehicle location, our patrols will be able to reach members more quickly and where possible, prepared with appropriate replacement parts.

'Our promise is to be the motorist's champion and our aim is to make it easier, safer, and more affordable for our members to own and run a car.'
