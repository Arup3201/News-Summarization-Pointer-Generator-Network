QPR winger Michael Petrasso is joining Notts County on a 93-day loan.

Former Rangers midfielder Shaun Derry, now manager at Notts County, tried to sign Canadian Petrasso 11 months ago but the winger joined Oldham instead. 

Petrasso has just completed a month’s loan at Leyton Orient and also had a spell with Coventry last season.

The 19-year-old has made just one league appearance for QPR since putting pen to paper on a new deal in April.

The Canadian Under 20 international will not be eligible to star for County in the FA Cup, but has been given the green light to play in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.
