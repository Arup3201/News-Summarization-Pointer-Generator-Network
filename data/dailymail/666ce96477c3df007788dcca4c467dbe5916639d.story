A reckless motorcyclist led police on a terrifying eight-minute 156mph chase through traffic, a court heard today.

Peter Clarke, 44, scraped through gaps between cars on his Suzuki motorcycle as he sped down the three-line carriageway in Cambridgeshire.

The motorcyclist - who eventually pulled over - insisted that he was an experienced rider and knew what he was doing.

Terrifying: Motorcyclist Peter Clarke (ahead in the distance) reached a top speed of 156mph. Here the police motorcycle rider pursues him at 154mph

Clarke escaped a jail sentence but was banned from the roads after a jury at Peterborough Crown Court found him guilty of dangerous driving.

The court heard the defendant failed to spot the police motorcycle following him on the northbound triple-lane carriageway in Alconbury, Cambridgshire.

He told the court he was in total control of his motorcycle at all times and that it was built for speed.

However, he was eventually flagged down and stopped near Sawtry.

Sentencing him, Miss Recorder McAllister  said his actions constituted 'reckless driving threatening others'.

He was banned from driving for 18 months, fined £1,000 ordered to pay costs of £1,000 and a £15 victim surcharge.

Clarke, from Sutton St Edmund, 
Lincolnshire, had admitted speeding but denied dangerous driving on the 
A1 at Brampton at about 4.15pm on May 12.

Top Speed: Clarke, 44, insisted he was not driving dangerously as he travelled at more than double the speed limit because he knew what he was doing

Guilty: The motorcyclist denied dangerous driving - and insisted he knew what he was doing. However, the jury disbelieved him

Police Constable Francis Crawford said he was pleased the court had taken Clarke's 'highly dangerous' driving seriously.

'Excessive speed on the roads, no matter how competent a driver you believe you are, is not acceptable and will not be tolerated by police,' he said.

'Our priority is to keep all road users safe and prevent deaths and serious injuries, clearly someone travelling at more than twice the legal speed limit puts not only themselves, but also other motorists, at grave risk of harm.

'Speed limits are set for a reason and any momentary lapse in concentration or sudden movement by this motorcyclist or other motorists travelling on that stretch of road could easily resulted in someone being killed.

'Peter Clarke's actions on the day were highly dangerous and we're pleased that has been recognised by the court.'

Closing in: Moments later Clarke, 44, pulled over on his Suzuki and stopped on the hard shoulder
