Witnesses have spoken of their horror after a toddler was fatally run down in a supermarket car park in front of her distraught mother.

An eyewitness to the tragic incident said the woman screamed 'someone help my daughter', after the two-year-old girl was hit by a car outside the Asda store in Wembley, north west London.

A large crowd gathered to try and help last night as paramedics were called. Despite their efforts, the young girl died later in hospital.

The female driver of the car was not arrested. However, police are appealing for witnesses.

Distressting: A large crowd gathered outside the Asda supermarket last night in Wembley, north west London, after a two-year-old girl was fatally hit by a car in the car park in front of her mother

The tragic incident happened at 8.30pm yesterday and involved a black Volkswagen Estate. Witnesses said the child was killed near the zebra crossing in front of the store.

Local
 resident Bill Richardson, 26, said: 'Just before 9pm I had gone 
to Asda to get some petrol, when I noticed a large crowd of about 40 
people gathered near the main entrance.

'I could hear a woman desperately screaming "my daughter, my daughter, somebody please help my daughter".

'I
 went closer to see what was happening and could see a woman aged in her
 mid-20s wearing jeans and a white t-shirt covered in blood.

'When I got closer I could see a small child lying on a the floor - she was not moving.

'One of the onlookers then put his jacket over her 
to keep her warm, but the mum would not stop screaming.'

Mr Richardson said a man in his early 20s then ran into the crowd and it appeared an argument, then a physical fight, broke out between him and another man.

'As I left the petrol 
station I could hear sirens and then saw two ambulances, two police 
cars, two police vans pull into Asda,' Mr Richardson said. 'It was all very frantic.'

Another witness said: 'I saw the paramedics attending the small child, who was lying on the ground wrapped in blankets.

'Her mother was hysterical and crying. The father had to be calmed by police.

'The crowd was dead silent. Everyone was in shock. It was horrible seeing the little girl lying on the floor under blankets.'

Another
 witness, @balalmah, wrote on Twitter: 'I just came out and saw her on 
road. ASDA needs to add light to entrance area. God have mercy on her.'

A
 police car blocked the entrance to the car park until midnight and the store was closed while police carried out their 
investigations.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in which a two-year-old girl died.

'Police were called at 8:34pm to Asda car park, Forty Lane, Wembley, to reports of a collision between a car and a child.

'London
 Ambulance Service was called to the scene. The girl, aged two, was treated at the scene. She was then taken to a north west London 
hospital where she subsequently died.

'No arrests have been made. We will name her when all the next of kin have been informed.'

In
 a statement, Asda offered its condolences to the girl’s family.

Spokeswoman Lauren Pell said: 'Our thoughts are with the families at 
this time and we’d like them to know we’re here for them if they need 
us.'

A post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or has information that may assist police should call the Metropolitan Police's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 020 8991 9555.
