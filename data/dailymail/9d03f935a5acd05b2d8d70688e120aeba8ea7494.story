Police are on the hunt for three thieves who broke into a Florida restaurant, stripped naked and took off with 60 hamburgers, three pounds of bacon and three red peppers.

Authorities in Bonita Springs have released security footage showing the three men, who appear to be of college age, as they raid Doc's Beach House around 3am on Sunday, July 20.

They are hoping someone recognizes the fearless trio, whom one waitress branded, 'Dumb, dumber and dumbest', the News-Press reported.

The footage shows the men - two completely naked and one in underwear - breaking in to the restaurant and roaming around the kitchen area before selecting the hamburgers and bell peppers.

Do you know these men? Crime Stoppers released security footage in the hope of tracking them down

At one point, one of the men spots a camera pointing at them and attempts to turn it away - unaware that another camera is nearby recording their every move.

The men then apparently fled on foot and headed towards the Collier County line - leaving a trail of red peppers along the beach behind them.

'They left a trail like Hansel and 
Gretel,' Doc's waitress Shelly Isom said, the News-Press reported. 'One of them 
probably said after, "Uh, guys, where did we leave our clothes?"'

Authorities,
 who do not know if the men are tourists or residents, released the most
 family-friendly images of the break-in on Wednesday to ask the public 
for help identifying the men.

Scene: The restaurant's general manager joked that the waitresses now wanted to work the night shift

Doc's general manager Lou Bangert joked that her waitresses want the athletic-looking thieves to return.

'Everybody wants to work the night shift now,' she said.

Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS (8477).
