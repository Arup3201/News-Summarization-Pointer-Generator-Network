U.S. police are under pressure not only
for the killing of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, Missouri - for which a grand jury decided yesterday not to indict the officer - but also for the military-style response to the
sometimes violent protests that followed.

The sight in August of police in camouflage gear, backed up
by armoured vehicles and brandishing assault rifles, was a
reminder that some American police departments have recently
acquired U.S. military-surplus hardware from wars abroad.

Yet many other law enforcers around the world have rules of
engagement that allow lethal force to be used relatively freely.

Power: Serbian police officers from the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit pose for a picture in their base outside the capital city Belgrade

Armed: Belgian special forces pose for a photograph with an armoured vehicle and working dog outside their headquarters in central Brussels

Padded: A member of the Philippine National Police bomb squad stands with a bomb scanner and padded suit at a police station in Manila

Lightly armed: Afghan police officers pose with light bullet-proof vests and assault rifles outside a base in Kabul

Smart: London police constables Ben Sinclair and Karen Spencer pose for a photograph wearing their Metropolitan Police beat uniforms

Venezuela's Interior Ministry decrees that, when peaceful
methods of resolution have failed, police must warn violent
demonstrators that there will be a 'progressive, differentiated
use of force'.

While no firearms must be carried for peaceful
demonstrations, when things turn violent, the emphasis is on
avoiding harm to children, pregnant women and the elderly.

Afghanistan's police, often themselves the target of armed
attacks, are officially authorised to respond with weapons 'and
explosives', albeit only after other methods have failed, and no
fewer than six warnings have been issued.

But for every regulation that gives police wide scope to use
firearms, there is another code that sharply limits their use.

Mexican and Indian riot police follow defined escalation
protocols that go from verbal warnings to physical constraint,
tear gas, water cannon or pepper spray, rubber bullets or baton
rounds, and then use of firearms.

Yet while Mexican police commanders can decide when to
escalate, India's Rapid Action Force requires approval from an
on-the-spot magistrate for each new step.

Many countries spell out that any use of firearms is a last
resort, though this can be defined many ways.

Britain, Serbia, Bosnia and the Philippines allow guns to be
fired only if a life is at risk. Britain stands out for its
insistence that 'individual officers are accountable and
responsible for any use of force and must be able to justify
their actions in law'.

Other Western European countries, meanwhile, allow firearms to
be used 'where necessary' to detain suspects or to prevent a
serious crime.

No body armour: Members of the United Nations security forces pose in front of the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva 

Tough: Afghan policeman Zabiullah, 24, poses for photo in Kabul. He wears no body armour and carries an old-fashioned assault rifle

Police at the extraterritorial United Nations buildings in
Geneva are not subject to Swiss law but still conform to local
police rules. 

These rules, like those governing police in Italy,
Austria, Belgium and Bosnia, specify that the use of force must
be 'proportionate'.

In Belgium, human rights monitors say, this means firearms
can never be used for crowd control.

Malaysia's Federal Reserve Unit, the main riot force, is
permitted to use firearms only when protesters are using them,
but it is in a fortunate position. Its deputy superintendent,
Kulwant Singh, says that 'firearms have not been used in the 59
years since the FRU was formed'.
