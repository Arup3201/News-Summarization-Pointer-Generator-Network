Police have apprehended an imposter who dressed as Captain Jack Sparrow and allegedly threatened a security guard with a knife on the Gold Coast set of the latest Pirates Of The Caribbean film.

Queensland Police said the man was arrested in the suburb of Palm Beach 10.15am on Wednesday, almost a day after he broke onto the set.

The man was shirtless but had the same live parrot on his shoulder that he was spotted with on the set of the blockbuster film. He was trying to hitchhike on the highway with his girlfriend, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported

Not only does the young man resemble Johnny Depp's character Captain Jack Sparrow (pictured), he also has the same disregard for rules

The pair were taken to Coomera Police station and the man is currently being questioned by police, but he has not been charged.

The young man broke onto the Pirates Of The Caribbean set on Tuesday wearing an extravagant pirate costume, complete with a live bird, dreadlocks and heavy eye-liner.

The impersonator's costume was so convincing he was initially mistaken for one of the film’s extras. 

Police were alerted to the incident at 12.30pm after the intruder threatened a security guard with a knife. It was initially reported that the wannabe buccaneer brandished a sword.

He fled the set into nearby bushland and went on the run for 22 hours. A sizeable police and dog squad were called to the set.

The Jack Sparrow lookalike was allegedly trying to join the cast of the film.

Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Orlando Bloom, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush are some of the major stars that will be filming 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' in Australia.

The fifth instalment of the incredibly popular ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ franchise has just begun filming in Helensvale on Queensland’s Gold Coast. Scenes will also be filmed in Port Douglas.
