A British solicitor has claimed that ‘Jihadi John’ gatecrashed her daughter’s wedding.

According to court documents, Mohammed Emwazi used 22-year-old Gina Morgan’s wedding in 2011 as cover for a secret meeting with members of his terror network.

But Ms Morgan’s mother, Jacqueline Nuth, 53, suggested Emwazi wasn’t invited. She said: ‘I’ve no connection to him and my daughter has no connection to him.

The veiled woman at Ms Nuth's home (left) declined to speak to reporters over claims Mohammed Emwazi (right) attended the solicitor's daughter's wedding as a cover for a terror meeting in 2011 

'It’s absolute rubbish. None of my family have anything to do with him.’

According to the court papers, her daughter’s wedding to an Egyptian Muslim was held at the home of the wife of a terror suspect referred to as ‘CE’, who once spent time at an Al Qaeda training camp.

Emwazi turned up with another man, Mohammed Mekki, and is then thought to have discussed ‘extremist activity’ with CE.

The papers state that Ms Nuth ‘describes as “absurd” the suggestion that extremist activity was discussed’. 

However they note that ‘Ms Nuth left shortly after the arrival of Mekki and Emwazi at about 10pm and so cannot speak of what occurred after her departure’.

Later that year all three men were described in court as supplying funds and equipment to Somalian terrorists.

Ms Nuth told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I don’t want to get drawn into all this. What was said in court was confidential. As a solicitor I do not want to compromise my position.’

It is believed her daughter, now 26, is living at Ms Nuth’s West London home, having spent time in Egypt. Yesterday a woman in a niqab arrived at the flat but declined to speak to a reporter.

It also emerged last night that Emwazi may have collected money for jihad from friends and neighbours in London, under the pretence of fundraising for Syria.

The 26-year-old entered Syria some time after the wedding where he has taken on the role as the masked executioner of its propaganda videos
