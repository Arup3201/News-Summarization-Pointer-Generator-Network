Shinji Kagawa says he has ‘nothing to prove’ to English football fans as he gets ready to face Arsenal on Tuesday night.

Kagawa rejoined Borussia Dortmund last month after two unsuccessful seasons at Manchester United.

The 25-year-old attacking midfielder arrived at Old Trafford with a big reputation after helping Dortmund to two successive titles.

The Japan international scored on his second Dortmund debut against Freiburg on Saturday 

But Kagawa never cemented a first-team place and returned to Germany where he scored on his second Dortmund debut on Saturday.

‘I had a feeling when I left Dortmund that it would not be a door that was shut forever,’ Kagawa said.

‘I had a real ambition to play in England - but now I feel I am back where I belong.

‘Being back with Dortmund feels like being back with family - and as a player there is no better feeling than that.

‘I don’t feel like I have anything to prove to the fans in England - but I know that in England they did not see the best of me.

‘Already I am feeling that I am on the way back to the level I want to be.

‘It will take time - but I am finally on the right path.’

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal had no qualms in allowing Kagawa to leave Old Trafford 

Kagawa is set to start for Jurgen Klopp’s side as they welcome Arsenal to the Westfalenstadion.

The Japanese knows Arsenal well from his time in England and he is wary of the trheat posed by Arsene Wenger’s side.

‘It is a big game against Arsenal,’ Kagawa added. ‘I know they are a very strong team - but it is important that we open our European campaign with a win.

‘We have some big players unavailable, but we also have a very strong squad - and feel we still have enough to beat Arsenal.

‘There is no feeling like playing Champions League football - and I am grateful Dortmund have given me the chance to play in this competition again.

‘I think over the last years Dortmund have shown they are not there just to make up the numbers - but to try and win it.’
