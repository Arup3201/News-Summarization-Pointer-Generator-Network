They might look like something straight out of a horror film, but these extraordinary images have been created to show the special bond between dogs and their owners.

Photographer Sebastian Magnani, 27, from Brig, Switzerland, took pictures of dogs and their owners using the same position and camera settings before working his magic with editing software.

The result is this startling set of images, which show the pooches with human clothes - one wearing a hoodie, another with a red coat, one with a shirt and cardigan, and another with a blue jacket.

Amazing: The result of Mr Magnani's work is this startling set of images, which show the pooches with human clothes - one wearing a hoodie, another with a coat, one with a shirt and cardigan, and another with a jacket

Mr Magnani wrote on his blog: ‘I had a spontaneous idea in 2009 to blend my dog with my friend in one person. Thus I was able to put on my bedside table a picture of my two favourites in one picture.’

Mr Magnani, who now lives in Berne, discovered a love for photography in 2006 and spent five years as a graphic designer in Brig, before deciding to ‘make his passion his profession’, his website said.

Photography blogger Tom White said: 'I can’t help but try to nitpick at any flaws I can find within photo manipulations, but I'm seriously struggling with these creations. They’re flawless.'

And blogger Michele Llanos said: 'If these images don’t put a smile on your face, you must be made of stone. How did this photographer manage to get such personality in these images?

‘Each one of these dogs is infused with its own essence and character, giving us an excuse to imagine Who are they? Where do they come from? What do they do?’
