A former Miss Britain competitor falsely claimed thousands of pounds in benefits as a single parent when she was in fact living with her boyfriend, a court has heard.

Rachel Hatton, 29, told South Northamptonshire Council that her alleged partner, Nathaniel Simon, was just her landlord when she moved into a four-bedroom house owned and lived in by him.

The pair claimed Simon slept in a caravan on the driveway of the house while she lived inside because he needed to rent his property to help pay off his mortgage.

She made claims for council tax and housing benefit, legal aid and income support, and was awarded £511 to cover the £675 monthly rent, Northampton Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Laura Hobson told the jury that it was not a 'commercial landlord-tenant arrangement' and the pair were actually involved in a romantic relationship.

She said the pair should have informed the council about their relationship because it would have affected the amount of benefits Hatton received.

Blonde-haired Hatton, who appeared in court today wearing a black skirt and jacket and stiletto heels, hit the headlines in 2010 after becoming the first single parent/divorcee to be allowed to enter the Miss Great Britain competition.

The mother of one won the regional title of Miss Warwickshire before going on to the finals of the contest.

Simon, 36, who also owned and rented out a number of other properties, did not make her pay for any utility bills or make up the shortfall in the rent for the house in Foxfield Way, Grange Park, Northampton, the court heard.

The court heard extracts from interviews carried out by investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions with Hatton in February and March last year.

She told them she and her son previously lived in a house in Newport Pagnell, which was also owned by and rented from Simon, after she separated from her husband.

When the house in Northampton came up she said she was keen to take it because she wanted to move back to the area.

The court heard that Hatton told investigators she had slept with Simon a couple of times but had never been in a relationship with him.

'I’ve never had a relationship with Nathaniel,' she said in interview. 'He’s not the sort of guy I would want a relationship with, to be honest.

'He’s my landlord. I can probably understand how it looks now I’ve been brought in but there’s no relationship at all.'

He ended up living in the caravan, she said, because his work situation changed and he could not afford the mortgage on the house and needed some extra income from renting.

Hatton described herself as a 'convenience' to him as he was paid rent while making improvements to the house with an intention to sell.

She told investigators the situation between them was 'open and flexible' - Simon had a key to the property and they would sometimes eat together or watch television in the evening, and she occasionally did his washing.

He was also insured to drive her white Audi car and the pair had been on holiday together to Turkey.

Hatton also told investigators: 'We were definitely friends but I’ve not realised until now that all these things I’ve been doing in your eyes have been wrong.'

In interviews with Simon, the court heard he described their involvement as an 'off-off relationship' and he had been doing a lot to try to win her heart.

Hatton, of Foxfield Way, denies one count of making false representation, two counts of fraud by failing to disclose information and a further count of fraud by false representation over a two-year period between 2009 and 2011 in relation to the benefits claims.

Simon, of the same address, denies furnishing false information in relation to the tenancy agreement he and Hatton had, and another charge of fraud by failing to disclose information.
