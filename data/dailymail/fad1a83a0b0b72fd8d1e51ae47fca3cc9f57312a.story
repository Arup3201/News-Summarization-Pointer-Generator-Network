A new fashion craze is sweeping the country as monkey owners dress their pets as pirates, cowboys and disco dancers.

The adorable garments are all handmade by internationally-renowned designer Julie Staup, who has sold thousands of outfits around the world.

Her online business Sew Simply Monkey is the one-stop shop for unique designs and requests for costumes have gotten more and more outrageous.

Biker: Mattie's owner Pam Welch has purchased an array of costumes for her

Long-term customer and friend Pam Welch has been one of her biggest advocates since day one - purchasing an array of cute costumes for her monkeys Mattie and Tito.

After wowing onlookers with her passion for fashion, 15-year-old white face Capuchin Mattie is now a full time model and entertainer who is regularly booked for birthdays and parties.

Mum-of-three owner Pam said: 'Mattie is the star attraction and absolutely loves to entertain people and the attention she gets.

Pirate: Model Mattie is now a full time model  and children's entertainer but is still one of Julie's best customers

'It started by her joining me at a market and the public just couldn't take her eyes off her and kept asking to have their picture taken with Mattie.

'She loves kids and is great at sitting on their laps for a picture. She will give you a high five, a kiss, shake your hand and play ball.

'She can't wait to get dressed up, her favourite outfit is definitely the pirate.'

Mattie spent the first 13 years of her life living with an elderly couple before joining the Welch family.

Adorable: Mattie's owner has had a positive response from people hiring Mattie as a children's entertainer

Friends: Mattie's owner admits that the monkey now relishes being at the centre of attention

She has grown accustomed to the positive response she gets and relishes being the centre of attention.

Eight-month-old Tito is joining the brigade and melting hearts as he straddles a toy horse in his finest Western wear.

Julie, who has been creating bespoke monkey clothing for more than a decade, insists that all the outfits are made for fun-loving owners.

Julie said: 'I would never recommend people dress their monkeys in costumes, but they are all individually made to their sizes from safe materials and are comfortable.

'They don't harm the animals, quite often they need nappies when being kept in domestic environments so it's for practical reasons, they also help to keep them warm in the winter.

'But a lot of owners want to treat their pets and make them look glamorous so whatever they request I can make for them.'
