A disturbing racist video has emerged of three girls aged between five and seven singing 'if you all hate p**** clap your hands' to the tune of a popular children's song.

The three blonde children are shown sitting in a circle clapping their hands while singing the hate chant for the amusement of an adult filming them.

During the racist song a toddler boy wanders around the room while the little girls sing the offensive phrase to the tune of 'If you're happy and you know it clap your hands'.

The video, believed to have been produced in the Greater Manchester area since the New Year, has sparked outrage online and among anti-racism charities.

Upsetting: A racist video of these three children singing 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' has been released online

Family: The film is believed to have been made in the Greater Manchester area and was filmed by and adult 

The unidentified children are being watched by an adult whose legs can be seen at the bottom of the clip. 

The clip - which is being circulated via Twitter and Whatsapp - has provoked an angry response online.

Writing on Twitter, Sidrah Hussain said: 'I actually can't believe that!!! 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' racism taken to the next level.'

Haroooon R added: 'That video of 3 little kids singing 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' is so upsetting.'

Samira Axo wrote: 'I'm so baffled. A nursery rhyme turned into a racist chants by little kids.'

Anti-racism charities have blamed the parents for warping their children's minds.

One appalled man who saw the footage online said: 'It's disgusting. I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

'Of course you can't blame the girls - they've been taught this by people much older than them.

'It shows a whole new level of racism. How can we expect them to grow into tolerant and respectful adults, if they are being taught songs like this at such a young age?'

The 13 second clip is understood to have been filmed in a living room in the Manchester area in 2015.

The three little girls sit in a smart-looking carpeted living room with a large leather sofa.

It has been slammed by anti-racism educational charity Show Racism the Red Card, who use football to stamp out intolerance in the wider society.

A spokesman for the charity said: 'The fact these young people are using such an offensive term so freely openly shows a lack of understanding about the nature of the term from their guardians. 

'The fact young people are using this word doesn't come as a surprise given a study from Show Racism the Red Card Wales found a quarter of people believe calling a Pakistani person a paki was acceptable.'

Blurred: The identities of the children are not known, and have been obscured by MailOnline, but they are known to be between the ages of five and seven  

Charity Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI) said the video 'fostered hatred and fuelled divide' and the children had been 'manipulated' by adults.

Interim director Alex Raikes MBE said: 'Social media can be a tool that tackles inequalities and promotes human rights, tolerance and respect or as in this case can foster hatred and fuel divide.

'Aside from this potentially breaching the law by inciting racial hatred, what is particularly upsetting about this film is the abuse of young minds - children are not born racist - they are taught.

'Here we see this in action. This is a form of child exploitation.

'These children have been manipulated by adults who have taken advantage of their innocence and then disseminated them on film to the wider public - have they had a say in this?

'This can label them in the longer term.

'Children are like mirrors and they reflect the culture in which they live and are captive to their parents' viewpoints.

'In a week where we have seen events that show both the value we all place on freedom of speech, and at the same time how people can be indoctrinated and manipulated to perpetrate atrocities - here we may believe this is simply freedom of expression albeit unpalatable to many - but actually this is nothing short evidence of indoctrination on film.

'Moreover, whose freedom of speech is this? These children had no say in this.

'For SARI, films like can be also very distressing to the members of our community that these children have unwittingly maligned.'
