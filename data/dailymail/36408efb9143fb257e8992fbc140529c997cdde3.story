Tragic: Schoolgirl Jessica Jevons, 12, was found hanged by her twin brother Patrick in her family home in Walkden, Greater Manchester

A 12-year-old schoolgirl was found hanged after being sent to bed early following a row with her twin brother about sharing the family computer, an inquest heard.

Jessica Jevons staged a 
'demonstration of annoyance' on the landing in her home in the 
expectation of being found quickly and 'shocking' relatives into a 
response.

But it was 15 minutes before her twin brother Patrick found her as he went upstairs to bed in Walkden, Greater Manchester.

The schoolgirl died despite her mother Michelle's attempts to revive her.

Jessica, who also had two other brothers, was described as a 'happy and 
outgoing' schoolgirl who had been arguing with Patrick about using the family PC just before she died.

The youngster, who was a Year Eight pupil at St
George's Roman Catholic High School, was told to go bed but stormed upstairs and hanged herself on February 5.

Her mother said in a statement read to the inquest in Bolton: 'This has come totally out of the blue, she was a happy, outgoing girl, she had been happy all that week and she was looking forward to going to Spain for the summer holidays.

'She had a boyfriend and they had a good relationship. She did not have any issues and was happy at school she had lots of friends. She had been bullied at school years before but had got over that and had blossomed and had not been bullied since.

'She had never attempted to take her life before. We can't understand, we think it was an accident which went wrong. We can't believe it was intentional, there are no issues over the circumstances of her death.'

She added: 'Jessica had an argument with her brother, they had argued about the use of our computer. Jessica was told to go to bed, it would have been around 9 pm.

'At around 9.15 pm Patrick also went upstairs to bed and he discovered Jessica.

'He raised the alarm and got her down and I commenced CPR and an ambulance was called - but sadly Jessica had died.'

Detective Inspector Kevin Johnston said that efforts were being made to revive the schoolgirl when he arrived.

He
said: 'The conclusion I reached is that she positioned herself so that 
whoever was next upstairs behind her would have seen her and would be 
shocked into responding.

'With
exactly how she intended to present herself the intention was to shock 
her brother or whoever was going up the stairs following the minor 
incident with her brother.'

Tributes: Jessica Jevons was described as' an extremely popular girl' with a 'lively outgoing character' by her headteacher

Death: Jessica was found hanged in the family home in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Despite her mother's efforts to revive her she was pronounced dead at the scene

Recording a verdict of accidental death Bolton coroner Jennifer Leeming said: 'I could not possibly say that this young lady intended to take her own life.

'The situation is that Jessica has gone upstairs after a minor row, she has been absent from the family for a very short time, nothing has been heard.

'She has placed herself in a situation
- where allowing for the fact that there were more private locations, 
she must have known she could be easily found indicating to me that was 
her intention.

'She was 
displaying herself, she had put herself on display to demonstrate upset 
or an annoyance in the hope that she would be found. It seems to me that
Jessica probably intended a demonstration that has tragically gone 
wrong.'

Jessica's parents Michelle and Duncan were not at the inquest and were excused attending.

They were said to 'deeply devastated and shocked' and in a statement expressed 'how much Jessica touched the hearts of many, especially Patrick.'

Philip Harte, the headteacher at Jessica's school, said: 'She was an extremely popular girl, especially amongst the staff, and she will be fondly remembered for her lively outgoing character.

'This sad news has come as a great shock to us all and I am proud of the dignity and respect shown by our staff and children as we have supported each other.'

Claire Fewings, the parent of one of Jessica's friends, said: 'Jess showed kindness, love and compassion for her friends and family like no other child I've known.

'I would see Jess most mornings on my way to work, she would have a spring in her step, sparkling eyes and run over to me. My memories of Jess will forever be of a very special, happy, smiling beautiful girl and a dear friend to my son.'

Father John Flynn, from the Salford Diocese, said: 'It is very sad and we hope and pray for the family at this time and offer our sympathy.'
