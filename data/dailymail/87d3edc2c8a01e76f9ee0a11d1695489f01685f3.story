Ministers are to sweep away planning restrictions on disused urban sites in a bid to reduce the impact of new house building on the countryside.

Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday said that the Government planned to ‘augment’ its controversial planning reforms with the introduction of ‘practical ways of removing red tape’.

These will include a ‘relaxation’ of the rules that make it difficult to convert warehouses and industrial premises into flats and housing estates. This could lead to the construction of a string of new housing developments on edge-of-town sites, reducing the need for house building in open countryside.

Plans also include a package of measures to ‘regenerate’ so-called brownfield sites, which have been developed before.

The plans are expected to include a new presumption in favour of development on virtually all brownfield sites.

Developers claim that brownfield sites are often too difficult and expensive to bring back into use.

This stance has led to massive pressure on councils to free up green field sites for development – to the anger of many rural communities.

Tory MPs, under pressure from local residents, have been urging ministers to shift the focus for development from green field sites to urban locations.

A Government source said the new proposals would make it easier for developers to build new homes on brownfield sites.

‘Our intention is quite clear that we want to see more development on brownfield,’ the source said.

Ministers believe the changes could help balance the need for new housing development against the resistance to new housing estates in many Tory constituencies.

Mr Pickles believes that he has extracted firm commitments that the Green Belt should be protected from development in most circumstances as part of the deal.

Ministers are also bringing forward proposals to help regenerate Britain’s high streets, including planning reforms to make it easier to change disused shops into restaurants and leisure facilities.
