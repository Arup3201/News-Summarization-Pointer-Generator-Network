It is one of the more arduous and frustrating moments of any holiday – the sometimes long wait to retrieve luggage from the baggage carousel.

But one UK airport has now published a list of the most efficient airlines when it comes to unloading and delivering passengers’ bags to the terminal.

London’s Gatwick detailed the time it took for the airlines who most frequently use the airport to successfully remove every bag from their aircraft.

London’s Gatwick detailed the time it took for the airlines who most frequently use the airport to successfully remove every bag from their aircraft

Handling agents employed by the airlines were deemed to be successful if they completed the task with 35 minutes when working with small planes and within 50 minutes when dealing with larger aircraft.

The results were recorded in Gatwick’s most recent monthly report.

Flybe, whose handling agent is Menzies, came top in the small aircraft category with 100 per cent of bags on 84 flights being returned to the terminal within the allotted 35-minute period.

Other airlines who fared well in the survey included Aurigny – with 99 per cent from 176 flights, and Aer Lingus – with 98 per cent from 283 flights.

Both airlines use Menzies as their handling agents.

Ryanair, whose handling agents are Swissport, also impressed with 98 per cent of bags on 231 flights being delivered on time.

However, handling agent Aviator fared significantly worse in the report when it came to small aircraft.

The company are employed by Royal Air Maroc, TAP Air Portugal, Air Southwest and Thomas Cook.

Royal Air Maroc managed to deliver luggage back to the terminal within 35 minutes of landing just 56 percent of the time.

TAP Air Portugal managed it just 57 percent of the time, while Air Southwest were successful 62 percent of the time and Thomas Cook on 64 percent of occasions.

Thomson Airways – which uses Swissport – also struggled, with 66 per cent from 199 flights.

For airlines operating larger aircraft, Icelandair and Garuda Indonesia, who both use Swissport, scored highest, with both achieving a score of 100 percent of bags, from 28 and 22 flights, respectively.

Emirates, who use Aviator, scored highly with 96 percent from 93 flights being unloaded and returned to the terminals within 50 minutes.

Vietnam Airlines, who also use Swissport, were successful on 95 percent of occasions in October.

Airlines deemed to have met Gatwick’s standards are those that score 95 per cent of above, meaning Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Aurigny and Monarch were among those who passed.
