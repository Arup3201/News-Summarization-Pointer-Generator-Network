The American and Russian figure skating teams have been accused of conspiring to fix who will receive the sport's Olympic medals.

According to an anonymous Russian coach, the two countries decided ahead of the Sochi Games just who would be receiving which place on the podium.

Russian judges vowed to support American skaters Charlie White and Meryl Davis to win gold in the  ice dancing competition if the same was done for Russia in the team and pairs event, the coach claimed.

The allegations appeared this weekend in the French daily newspaper devoted to sports, L'Equipe.

The U.S.-Russian alleged deal was to let the American duo White and Davis triumph over their closest adversaries, Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir - the reigning Olympic champions.

Davis and White set an Olympic record on Sunday with a 114.34 ice-dancing score, nudging Team USA to a bronze in the team figure skating competition and making them hot favorites to win gold at the pairs event on February 17.

Russia won the new event of team figure skating and lifted the host nation to its first gold medal of the Sochi Olympics on Sunday.

In no discipline did Russia finish worse than third, compiling 75 points to Canada's 65 that won silver and the 60 that gave bronze to the Americans.

There are two figure skating 
competitions this year at Sochi - a team event which ended on Sunday and
 subsequently the men, women and pairs competitions will get underway.

The
 Russian camp denied the fixing allegations on Sunday, Team USA called them 
'categorically false' and Canada similarly brushed off the scandal.

Ice skating judges' ballots are now cast anonymously due to previous fixing scandals which dogged the sport in 2002 at the games in Salt Lake City, Utah.

It led to two pairs receiving gold medals - the original Russian winners Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze and the silver medalists Jamie SalÃ© and David Pelletier from Canada.
