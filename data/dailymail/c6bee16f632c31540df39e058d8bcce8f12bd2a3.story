Prosecutors said Thursday they will not file charges against a Northern California mother accused of grabbing the throat of a 12-year-old boy she suspected of bullying her daughter.

The Sonoma County District Attorney's Office said there were conflicting witness statements, and that prosecutors could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Delia Garcia-Bratcher attacked the youngster earlier this year at the Olivet Charter Elementary School.

No adult saw the confrontation at the time, and Miss Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not checked in with the school office before coming on campus, meaning no school officials were with her to witness what happened.

Regardless, Miss Garcia-Bratcher, 30, was arrested on suspicion of child abuse in the aftermath of the May 16 confrontation at the Santa Rosa elementary school.

Most of the eyewitnesses interviewed by prosecutors were children, according to Sonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Bill Brockley.

Two of these children claimed to have seen Miss Garcia-Bratcher grab the young boy by the throat, authorities said at the time.

However, there was no consensus about whether Miss Garcia-Bratcher did indeed touch the boy.

'Ethically, I can only file charges that I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury,' Mr. Brockley said. 

'If I don't have that evidence, then I can't file charges.'

Sheriff's officials also said they could not find any evidence linking the boy to the bullying allegations, and that Miss Garcia-Bratcher might have targeted the wrong person.

Miss Garcia-Bratcher acknowledged confronting the boy but said she did not touch him. 

In a seven-page report, an investigator hired by her attorney, Ben Adams, quoted a 10-year-old saying he saw the boy put both hands around his own neck after the encounter with Miss Garcia-Bratcher.

Mr. Adams said Thursday his client was glad to have the case behind her.

'They arrested her for no reason and dragged her to court for no reason,' he said.

The incident occurred after Miss Garcia-Bratcher went to the school to discuss her children's registration. 

When she ran into her son in the hallway, she asked him to point out the boy who has been calling her 10-year-old daughter a 'dirty Indian.' 

The boy said Miss Garcia-Bratcher yelled at him and grabbed him by the throat. Administrators called police after they noticed red marks on the boy's neck.

Miss Garcia-Bratcher was arrested the next day and released several hours later after posting $30,000 bail.

Following the incident, her lawyer called her a hero.

‘She is the mother of the year,’ Mr. Adams declared. ‘She did nothing wrong. Her daughter was being bullied, and she confronted the bully. What is wrong with that?’  

The case, at the time, sparked much debate on social media over how best to respond to bullying at schools.
