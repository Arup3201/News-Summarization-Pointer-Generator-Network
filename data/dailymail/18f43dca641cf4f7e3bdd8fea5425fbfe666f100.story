This was brutal. This was a painful, embarrassing lesson for England in how to play one-day cricket in an age where they have been left behind in the 50-over game. One of the teams involved in Saturday's showpiece at the Melbourne Cricket Ground have every chance of winning the World Cup and it isn’t England.

Australia were always going to be hot favourites in this opening match of the premier one-day tournament in front of 84,336 but this was much worse than England could have imagined.

Do not be fooled by the late England runs once the tension had gone from the contest. This was an absolute demolition of Eoin Morgan’s side and their aspirations of springing a Valentine’s Day surprise, as they lost by 111 runs.

First Australia made their highest ever one-day score against England, their murderous 342 for nine also being the most by any team against England in any of the World Cups stretching back 40 years.

Then England made a pitiful attempt at making history by collapsing not against their nemesis Mitchell Johnson nor even the equally rapid Mitchell Starc but a third Mitchell in the innocuous looking reserve all-rounder Mitch Marsh.

Steven Finn’s hat-trick, gained far too late to make any difference to the outcome off the last three balls of the innings, and James Taylor's classy, unbeaten 98 after the game had gone merely papered over alarming cracks.

Let us be clear. It is no disgrace to lose to Australia in this World Cup. The hosts are a powerful, gifted one-day side playing a high-octane brand of cricket and it will take an extremely good team to stop them returning to this great ground for the final on March 29.

England, in contrast, are a work in progress, having fallen way behind in a 50-over format which has progressed dramatically in the last two years while they have regressed because of ridiculous schedules and their prioritising of Test cricket.

Yet it is disgraceful to surrender so meekly, to capitulate to the least heralded member of the Australian attack so timidly with little of the heart and character that must be a bare minimum for any England side.

England would surely have hoped to show more signs of improvement than this, to have justified the quiet optimism in their ranks that has led to some of us talking hopefully of them as possible semi-finalists.

Well, the flawed structure of this tournament means that this defeat does not really matter in that regard because all England will have to do to make the last eight at least is defeat Scotland, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

But this will be a massive blow to their confidence and they will not be helped by the prospect of their second game being against another very strong one-day side and a good bet to win the cup themselves in co-hosts New Zealand.

England did not help themselves. To have any hope they had to take every half chance that came their way but as early as the fifth ball Chris Woakes had dropped Aaron Finch on nought and hope seeped out of England. It was inevitable then that Finch would go on to score a match-defining hundred.

It was not the only lapse by a long way. Moeen Ali got nowhere near a powerful catchable drive from David Warner, Gary Ballance, brought in at the 11th hour for Ravi Bopara, got nowhere near a skier from George Bailey and Jos Buttler could not hold on to a hard chance offered by Glenn Maxwell on 42.

And to think that England’s fielding had been excellent throughout a tri-series that actually provided encouragement that they were on the up. Their collapse in the field, at least until Stuart Broad and Joe Root held difficult chances to give Finn the first two wickets of his hat-trick, was simply inexplicable.

Australia, in contrast, were magnificent. They are without captain Michael Clarke and, more damagingly, James Faulkner, but this is a squad brimming with one-day talent and ready to seize their moment in front of their home fans.

If Finch provided the backbone to their innings with 135 they were also indebted to Glenn Maxwell for his late 66 off 40 balls at a time when England seemed to have clawed their way back towards sniffing a chance.

Twice, in fact, England were still in the match, firstly when Broad took two wickets in successive balls in the eighth over, and then when Finch and Bailey fell without two overs of each other. But each time Australia powered away.

Let’s clutch at some positive straws. Finn is getting back towards his full pace and finished with five for 71 while Broad is also nearing his best again. But the lack of a sixth bowler, exacerbated by the dropping of Bopara, meant that Morgan had nowhere to turn when his bowlers were suffering.

The game was effectively over by the halfway mark, England’s death bowling letting them down again with an almost total mystifying lack of yorkers, but England needed to at least make a decent fist of their reply. Instead they collapsed against a man who would not even have been playing had Faulkner been fit.

Once the rapid Starc had forced Moeen into an injudicious demise it was over to Marsh, no more than a medium-pacer compared to his team-mates, to cut swathes through the England batting line-up with ridiculous ease.

Only Buttler could consider himself unlucky, falling victim to a quite superb diving catch from Steve Smith that epitomised Australia’s excellence and mastery on the day. Most worryingly for England, captain Morgan suffered his fourth duck in five innings and looks painfully out of form.

When Buttler went England were 92 for six and facing complete humiliation but at least James Taylor, who did himself a power of good with an innings of proper industry and innovation, and Woakes showed some fight in a stand of 92 that delayed the inevitable. The innings ended in some farce when Taylor successfully reviewed an lbw decision only for the umpires to give Jimmy Anderson run out as the pair crossed after the initial decision. Surely the ball should have been dead once the umpire's finger was raised?

It only mattered to Taylor's attempts to score his first one-day international hundred. Marsh, barely believably, ended with five for 33 on a highly satisfying day for the hosts and England, meanwhile, have much to contemplate before Friday’s game in Wellington after one of their heaviest defeats in any World Cup match.
