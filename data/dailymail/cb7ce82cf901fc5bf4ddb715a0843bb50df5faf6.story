This underwater video shows the haunting interior of the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner nearly two and a half years after it sank off the coast of Italy.

Italian police have released footage of the stricken cruise liner which struck rocks and sank off the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio, killing 32 people, in January 2012.

The video, taken by police divers, has been released just days before salvage workers attempt to re-float the 950 foot vessel and tow it to the northern Italian port of Genoa where it will be dismantled and sold for scrap.

Italian police have released footage of the stricken cruise liner which struck rocks and sank off the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio, killing 32 people, in January 2012

The eerie footage shows the abandoned ship submerged in water and gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise liner which struck rocks with more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board. A total of 32 people drowned in the tragedy which occurred on January 13, 2012

The eerie footage shows the abandoned ship submerged in water and gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise liner which 4,200 passengers and crew fled after it struck shallow rocks.

However, while thousands managed to flee the stricken ship, 32 passengers drowned in the tragedy and captain Francesco Schettino remains on trial for charges of mass manslaughter and abandoning ship.

The 52-year-old faces allegations that he was showboating to onlookers on the holiday island before the ship grounded and has been accused of holding 2am trysts in his cabin with Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan, despite being a married man.

However, he denies the claims and charges and says he didn't abandon ship but instead fell onto a lifeboat as the ship keeled over on the night of the disaster on January 13, 2012.

He claims he then stayed on dry land because he wanted to co-ordinate the night-time evacuation from there.

Divers entered the sunken £372million vessel after it was righted and secured in a complex operation – heralded the biggest of its kind - last September.

Footage taken by them as they surveyed the marooned ship shows mangled furniture, upturned possessions and partial remains of what was once a luxury cruise liner.

Books, papers, clothing, flowers in a vase and staircases can all be seen in the haunting video, as well as the shells of shops and cafes which were once at the heart of the ship.

The video footage has been released just days before the wreck is expected to be righted and moved on to be sold for scrap.

The last of
 30 stabilising devices, known as ‘sponsons’, were attached to the wreck
 today and technicians are set to start testing all of the systems ahead
 of the final re-floating early next week.

Michael Thamm, chief executive of Costa Cruises, a unit of the liner's owner Carnival Corp, said: ‘Following installation of the last sponson, we can start the countdown to re-floating and final departure of the wreck.’

A consortium including oil services group Saipem and the Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio are all partaking in carrying out the dismantling.

However, the final voyage hasn't gone without a hitch.

Greenpeace
 has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship to obstruct the removal of the Costa 
Concordia, claiming the five-day journey is fraught with danger because 
of the risk that toxic fluids in the wreck could leak into the marine 
environment.

Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino denies the charges and claims he fell onto a lifeboat as the ship keeled over on the night of the disaster in January 2012

Luca Lacoboni, of Greenpeace Italy, said: ‘We cannot permit another environmental disaster.

‘To drag the wreck to Genoa would mean five days at open sea. The environmental risks are enormous in terms of leaking of poisonous fluids from the ship and in terms of the structure breaking down.

‘There are nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks.’

Genoa beat off many other contenders including ports in Turkey and the UK to win the lucrative contract, which will provide hundreds of jobs over two years. 

The last sponson has been installed on the port side of the wrecked ship ahead of its final move, which is due to be on July 10 depending on weather conditions

A 
spokesman for Costa Cruises said technical and engineering assessments 
have confirmed the wreck removal plan is safe, even in severe weather 
conditions.

'The wreck will be towed at low speed – average of 2 knots - and will be escorted by other vessels, with equipment and specialised personnel, including a team of marine biology experts and marine mammal observers, ready to intervene should any problem arise.'

Environmental safety would be the 'priority' of the wreck removal team, she said.

Organisers of the Concordia Wreck Removal Project said the last phases of the project to remove the 114,500-tonne vessel - the largest maritime salvage in history - would be revealed in further detail in the next few days.
