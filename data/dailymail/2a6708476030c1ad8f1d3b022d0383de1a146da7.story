Four-year-olds will be tested as soon as they start primary school under sweeping government reforms of exams and league tables unveiled yesterday.

From 2015, up to 600,000 will be given a ‘baseline’ assessment in counting and letter and picture recognition within weeks of starting in reception class.

Tests for seven-year-olds will continue to be marked by teachers but the writing assessment will include a separate exam in grammar, punctuation and spelling for the first time.

Meanwhile, 11-year-olds will face tougher tests in maths, reading, writing and grammar to check they are mastering a new, more rigorous curriculum.

The new tests for four-year-olds are being introduced to measure how well primary schools help their pupils progress until they leave at age 11.

Parents will be informed of the results but they will not be collated into league tables.

The shake-up will ‘expose coasting 
schools’, which will ‘no longer be able to hide behind apparently 
respectable results’, the Department for Education said.

But the changes will concern campaigners who fear play-based early education is becoming ‘schoolified’.

The new assessments for four-year-olds will be carried out by teachers ‘in the first few weeks of reception’, the DfE said.

It will be a ‘simple check of a child’s level of understanding - for instance, counting and picture or letter recognition’.

Parents will be informed of the results but they will not be collated into league tables.

Schools
 will be able to use the tests from September 2015 and they will become 
standard across the system from September the following year.

While the tests for four-year-olds will be voluntary, all but the most high-achieving schools are expected to use them.

Concerns have already been raised that schools could use the results to group young children by ability.

A 
separate proposal to rank pupils according to their results at age 11 - 
for example, telling parents their children are in the top or bottom 10 
per cent - has been shelved amid opposition.

Sue
 Robb, of the children’s charity 4Children, said the baseline assessment
 ‘must be part of a rounded assessment package’ and not ‘simply a “test”
 if it is to be effective’.

‘Young
 children are unlikely to accurately demonstrate their true capabilities
 within the first few weeks of entering school when many may still be 
settling into the new environment,’ she added.

The move is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of exams and league tables spanning education from four to 18.

Measures include requiring primary schools to meet tough new progress and achievement targets or face being put in the hands of new leadership.

These include ensuring 85 per cent of 11-year-olds meet a performance standard - against 65 per cent under the current system.

Secondary school league tables will be reformed to stop schools concentrating on pushing pupils up to a ‘blunt’ C-grade threshold at GCSE.

They will take a wider view of pupils’ achievement instead of ranking schools according to the numbers achieving five C grades or better.

Schools Minister David Laws said: ‘The new system will mean higher standards, no hiding place for under-performing schools and coasting schools, and real credit being given to schools and colleges which may have challenging intakes but which improve their pupils’ performance.

‘In primary schools, we are raising the bar to improve standards and introducing a proper measure of progress from when children start school to age 11.

‘I want to see all children leaving primary school with a good standard of reading, writing and maths so that they can thrive at secondary school. A better start at secondary school is a better start in life.’
