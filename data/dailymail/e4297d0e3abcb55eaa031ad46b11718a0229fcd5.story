Behind the scenes the discreet Marina Granovskaia has long been one of the most powerful women in football. 

But now the Russian is set to become even more influential as she is tipped to take over as Chelsea's chief executive at the age of just 39, following the surprise resignation of previous CEO Ron Gourlay.

Her glamorous good looks will inevitably draw comparisons with the outspoken, perfectly groomed 'first lady of football' and Apprentice star Karren Brady.

But anyone ready to dismiss Ms Granovskaia as merely a pretty face should be aware of a core of steel behind the megawatt smile.

Marina Granovskaia has long been one of the most powerful women in football. Now that Chelsea's chief executive Ron Gourlay is leaving the club, she is hotly tipped to be named incoming CEO

The Canadian and Russian national has been hotly tipped to be named incoming Chelsea CEO in a move which will come as little surprise to those who have been following her breathtaking ascent from humble PA to the 'voice of Roman Abramovich'.

She has been the most trusted member of the oligarch's inner circle for 17 years and is already often described as 'chief executive in everything but title', his 'eminence grise'.

Born in Russia, at school there was little indication of her future as a powerhouse in the footballing world with one former teacher describing her as a 'grey mouse'.

'I remember teaching her, but don't recall anything outstanding about Marina,' said the teacher. 'It's interesting how she has made such a successful career in sport in London.'

She studied at a Moscow school which specialised in music and dance, in which there were compulsory lessons, but at the time offered pupils no sport.

She graduated six months after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and studied in the Foreign Languages Faculty of Moscow State University before leaving with honours in 1997, and starting her career at Sibneft, the oil company which was then owned by Abramovich,.

Since she moved from the Russian capital to London when he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003, the billionaire is said to have grown to trust her implicitly.

Indeed, her position at his right hand is so secure that she often takes his place at meetings, delivers his messages and is said to have the speediest access to him.

She is known to be charming and polite, but ruthlessly firm by those who have met her. 

Just ask Chelsea captain John Terry - who was told in no uncertain terms to 'take it or f****** leave it' when trying to renegotiate his contract with 39-year-old Granovskaia.

Her biggest coup so far has been engineering the return to the club of Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese manager who was dubbed 'The Special One' during his first spell as Chelsea manager between 2004 and 2007.

Despite his success, he was sacked after falling out with Abramovich - but Ms Granovskaia apparently kept in constant touch with him, and last year was crucial in sealing the deal to bring him back from Real Madrid.

The manoeuvre was typical of her understated style, being just one of a string of delicate negotiations which she has carried out behind the scenes.

A source at the club told the Evening Standard: 'She is basically the power at Chelsea. Roman trusts her implicitly. She's not interested in being a celebrity but there is no doubt who's in charge and who call the shots.

'It is symbolic of her role that she was crucial in getting Jose (Mourinho) back. He had fallen out with Roman in very acrimonious and public circumstances and received a massive pay-off.

'It would have been very egg on face for Roman to bring him back even though the fans and players were calling for it. She was the one who said 'let's bring him back' and was the driving force behind the move. And it's paid off big time. 

While she was key to Mourinho's return it is Ms Granovskaia who is often said to be Abramovich's true 'special one', engineering big-money transfers such as Diego Costa's £32million move from Atletico Madrid and driving  meetings at the Bridge or at the club's training ground in Surrey.

She seems happy to pose with players in the rare pictures which can be found of her online. 

It is perhaps the fact that little is known of Ms Granovskaia that so endears her to the private Abramovich. 

Sports websites in her native Russia call her 'an absolutely non-public person', adding 'in that sense, she's similar to Abramovich.'

While outspoken West Ham United vice-chairman Karren Brady proudly touts herself as sporting executive, television broadcaster, newspaper columnist, author and novelist, search for Granovskaia on social media, and all you will find is a fiercely locked down Facebook account, set up in 2007.

It tells us that she studied at a Moscow school called 1113, a well regarded establishment dedicated to the arts. 

She also lists her association with Millhouse Capital, a British holding company set up in 2001 to manage Abramovich's assets.

The page also shows that she is a fan of annual Organic & Natural Beauty Show and the restaurant Sumosan - which caters for the VIP boxes at Chelsea.

Janina Wolkow and head chef Bubker Belkhit, told The Daily Telegraph last year: 'She's an amazing person. She's so professional, she knows what she wants. 

Granovskaia has been the most trusted member of the oligarch's inner circle for 17 years and is already often described as 'chief executive in everything but title', his 'eminence grise' on the ground

Her biggest coup so far has been engineering the return to the club of Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese manager who was dubbed 'The Special One' during his first spell as Chelsea manager between 2004 and 2007

'She's on top of any small thing to the biggest thing. Any small problem I contact her with, she deals with it on top of everything else she has on her shoulders.'

She is fluent in English and speaks several other European languages, and is said to be one of the primary architects behind Chelsea's youth scheme - by taking young talent and sending them on loan to develop. 

And while Mr Gourlay turned his attention towards the commercial end of the business, Ms Granovskaia became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations  - a far more familiar face around Stamford Bridge.

Agents heading to the Bridge or the club's training ground in Surrey were often met by <s Granovskaia, driving the meetings, increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director Michael Emenalo.

Karren Brady

Before becoming vice-chairman of West Ham United, the London-born businesswoman worked as an advertising account executive for the London Broadcasting Company, where she met current Hammers joint-chairman David Sullivan.

Sullivan later employed Brady as managing director at Birmingham City after he bought the club, and the pair were arrested then released on bail as part of the investigation into allegations of corruption in English football in 2006.

Sullivan and David Gold subsequently sold the club before purchasing West Ham and making Brady vice-chairman in 2010.

Brady was responsible for negotiating West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium, and has also held executive positions at Channel Four, Kerrang! magazine and Sport England.

Heather Rabbatts

Rabbatts became the first woman to be appointed as an FA director in 2011, and notably criticised the FA's commission to improve the national team as being 'all white, all male'.

After posts at the BBC, Channel Four and the charity Malaria No More UK, Rabbatt's first football role came in the form of the executive deputy chair at Millwall in 2006.

The daughter of former Welsh international footballer Terry Yorath, Logan was a promising gymnast in her teens but was forced to retire early due to neurological condition Sciatica. After a spell on local radio in Newcastle after university, she worked for Sky Sports and ITV before moving to the BBC in 2007. 

Amy Fearn

In 2010, Fearn became the first female to referee in the Football League during Coventry's 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the Championship.

Fearn always wanted to play football as a child, but after growing tired at the lack of playing opportunities, turned her hand to refereeing. 

She became fully qualified by the age of 14, and after plying her trade in the Midland Football Alliance, gained promotion to the Conference aged 26, despite balancing her officiating duties with her full-time job as an accountant. 

Elena Pianigiani

Pianigiani, aged 25, is vice-president of Italian fourth division side Poggibonsi.

Pianigiani got involved with football at an early age due to her father's involvement with Serie B side Siena - as a 10-year-old she became the mascot of the Tuscan side.

Pianigiani was appointed vice-president of Poggibonsi at the age of 21 in 2010 by her father, Antonello Pianigiani, after he purchased 51 per cent of the club two years earlier.

Elena said of her father's decision: 'It was unusual because I was only 21. When you're that age, it's usual for a father to give his daughter a new bag, not a football team.'
