The canine sidekick of a police officer shot to death in the line of duty gave a heart wrenching goodbye to his fallen partner Thursday, standing vigil at the funeral just before the casket was lowered into the ground.

It was a deeply emotional funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky police officer Jason Ellis, 33, who was murdered on a highway exit ramp May 25 in what police believe was a planned setup to lure the officer from the safety of his car.

His canine partner, Figo, stood beside his casket at Highview Cemetery in Chaplin, Kentucky and a touching photo shows the dog placing a loving paw on Ellis casket, as if giving his last goodbye.

Heartbreaking: K9 officer Figo placed a paw on the casket of his fallen partner Jason Ellis Thursday. Ellis, a Bardstown, Kentucky police officer was killed in the line of duty after, police say, he was ambushed on a highway ramp

Targeted: Husband and father of two, Ellis, 33, was a minor league baseball player turned drug enforcement officer. He was killed with multiple gunshot blasts May 25 after what police say was a planned ambush

Figo has been retired and given to Ellis’ widow, Amy, and his two sons, ages 6 and 7.

Last week, Amy spoke of the agony of sharing the news of his death with her two sons, who idolized their father.

'He wanted to make sure everybody was having a good time around him. He was a dedicated family man. He loved our boys. He loved me,' she said.

'I've laid on the bathroom floor.  I did not want to live another second without him.  I don't have the strength to pray right now, but I know that many others are praying for me and our family.

'Now I know I have to be strong for our kids.'

At
 Thursday's funeral, Police Chief Rick McCubbin said Ellis ‘paid the 
ultimate sacrifice doing what he loved, being a police officer.’ He 
called Ellis and Figo ‘true partners.’

The
 former minor league baseball player turned lawman was hit with multiple
 shotgun blasts early Saturday after he got out his cruiser to pick up 
debris at a ramp off the Bluegrass Parkway in Nelson County, according 
to Kentucky State Police. The investigation is continuing.

Hundreds
 of police officers from Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana, emergency workers 
and others attended services for Ellis, a K-9 officer who was on the 
drug task force.

‘Heaven
 is a real place. Jason is there,’ said the Rev. Brent Snook of First 
Baptist Church of Glen Este, in Batavia, Ohio, who had been Ellis’ 
childhood pastor.

Ellis’ flag-draped coffin was pulled on a caisson by one white horse. It was accompanied by five officers on horseback and one officer leading a riderless horse. A bagpipe and drummer played.

At the end of the burial service, two helicopters flew overhead and the bagpipe player played ‘Amazing Grace.’

At the morning service at Parkway Baptist Church in Bardstown, McCubbin told mourners Ellis was a fun-loving jokester who dressed as an elf at a town Christmas party, and he was proud of his work taking drugs off the streets with Figo.

Ellis was ‘gunned down in a senseless act of cowardice and you just want to cry out, ‘Why?’ Snook said at the funeral service.

Later, as the funeral procession inched slowly toward the cemetery 18 miles away, young and old stood on the roadside in this town of 12,000 and watched. Factories, office buildings and offices emptied as people lined the streets, many clutching American flags or holding their hands on their hearts.

Senseless: Hundreds of officers attended the funeral, including this Kentucky State Trooper, for Ellis who was slayed in a 'senseless act of cowardice'

Others held signs thanking Ellis for his service. A giant American flag hung between two fire-truck ladders in front of the police department. Outside the courthouse stood three judges in black robes.

Outside the police station in Bardstown, about 40 miles southeast of Louisville, a makeshift memorial featuring flags, candles, flowers and baseballs sat in front of a police cruiser signed with messages.

One message read: ‘I love you. Mom.’

Officials on Thursday announced that a reward fund in the case has surpassed $100,000.

Ellis had been a standout baseball player at the University of the Cumberlands, and he went on to play minor league ball in the Cincinnati Reds system from 2002 to 2005.
