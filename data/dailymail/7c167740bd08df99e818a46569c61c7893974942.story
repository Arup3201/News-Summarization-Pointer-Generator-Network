A woman charged with defacing the Washington National Cathedral has been ordered to a halfway house.

Jiamei Tian, 58, appeared at a preliminary hearing in D.C. Superior Court today, where a judge ordered that she wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and barred her from leaving the halfway house or having visitors.

The Chinese national living in the U.S. has been charged with damaging two chapels of the cathedral with a soda can of green paint on Monday.

Nabbed: Jia M. Tian, 58, has been ordered to a halfway house and must wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, a judge said

Clean-up: A worker cleans green paint from the organ in the Bethlehem Chapel at the National Cathedral on Monday. The Chinese woman was arrested at the scene with a soda can containing green paint

Vandal: The woman appeared in D.C. Superior Court on alongside a Mandarin translator

Police and prosecutors also believe 
she's connected to several acts of similar vandalism, including at the 
Lincoln Memorial, a church and at a Smithsonian statue.

Authorities
haven't revealed a motive. They say Tian has a Chinese passport and 
that she was traveling in Washington on an expired visa.

In another church near Thomas Circle, Tian allegedly splashed the organ with a mixture of white paint, feces and urine.

D.C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier told NewsChannel8 on Tuesday that the paint incidents are likely to be connected and that the woman may have 'mental health issues.'

Authorities also said that Tian appears to speak very little English and her motives remain unclear.

Green paint was discovered splattered onto the Lincoln Memorial early last Friday morning, and it was found later on a statue outside the Smithsonian headquarters on the National Mall, as reported by Wusa9.com.

Police said she had no fixed address but that she told officers she lived in Los Angeles.

Following her arrest, a witness contacted police and reported that the woman had been seen attending a service at a church less than a block from Thomas Circle, according to court documents.

The witness reported that the woman was carrying three bags with her. After she left, the witness found that a pipe organ in the church had been splattered with white paint, urine and feces, documents show.

Tian was arrested inside the cathedral on Monday afternoon, shortly after the still-wet green paint was discovered there.

When
a police officer approached her, she walked away and placed the soda 
can with green paint inside one of three bags that were sitting on 
chairs in the chapel.

Turning green: The woman was arrested Monday on charges she vandalized two chapels at Washington, DC's National Cathedral with green paint.

She also had green paint on her clothing, shoes and body, according to the documents.

She
was wearing a multicolored sock on her right arm, and a similar sock 
was found in a trash can in a bathroom at the cathedral on top of a can 
of green paint, according to the documents.

The bags placed in the chapel also had cans of green paint in them, the documents show.

Cleanup
crews have been working for the past few days to remove the paint from 
the Lincoln Memorial. Cleanup and restoration work at the cathedral was 
estimated to cost $15,000.

The Episcopal cathedral serves as the nation's spiritual home and has hosted state funerals and inaugural prayer services.

Other targets: The nearby Lincoln Memorial was also vandalized in the area

Bethlehem Chapel has surveillance cameras, but it wasn't immediately clear whether the vandalism was captured on video, said Richard Weinberg, a cathedral spokesman.

D.C. police said paint from the cathedral would likely be sent to the FBI for testing.

Bethlehem Chapel was opened in 1912 and is the oldest section of the cathedral. It was the site of President Woodrow Wilson's burial rites, and his remains were entombed there for more than three decades.

Wilson's remains were later interred in a memorial bay on the cathedral's main level.
