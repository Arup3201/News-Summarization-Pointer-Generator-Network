A 12-year-old dancer  taught by the Royal Ballet has stood up to bullies with a desperate open letter and video message declaring: 'This has to stop'.

Connor Williams made the heartbreaking plea after saying he had been tormented physically and emotionally every day since he started high school in September in Blackpool, Lancashire.

Connor danced with the Royal Ballet's Primary Steps programme for four years until last year, but said he started hiding his hobby after being picked on by other pupils.

Thousands of people have now viewed Connor's appeal after his mother Francine, 29, posted it on Facebook and YouTube - and he says he wants to send a message of hope to other children like him.

Defiant: Schoolboy Connor Williams, 12, has stood up to bullies with a desperate open letter and video message declaring: 'This has to stop'. He said he has been tormented in his first term at his new high school

Open letter: Connor named his alleged abusers and included speech bubbles of them saying 'you're a waste of space' and 'Haha why are you here, go s*** your mum'. He then wrote: 'I just wanna stick up for myself'

A-grade pupil Connor, now part of a group called Gifted and Talented, regularly takes part in shows and appeared as Elton John last year in the Schools Alive show at Blackpool's Grand Theatre.

He has also performed in shows with the adult Royal Ballet in London when he was with Primary Steps, his previous group which he has now outgrown. 

Year Seven pupil Connor said he had been physically and emotionally hurt by his alleged bullies.

He ended up in a fight with a boy he had never spoken to before after fellow pupils began hitting him ahead of a PE lesson at his school, Montgomery High in Blackpool, he claimed.

On another occasion he was pinned up against a wall by two Year 11 pupils, his mother said.

Connor's letter featured drawings of six tormentors with speech bubbles saying 'you're a waste of space' and 'Haha why are you here, go s*** your mum'.

The others are seen calling him a 'small gett' and say: 'Haha ye go do that you small non-human child'.

Video: This clip was shared online by Connor's mother Francine and has been viewed thousands of times

The drawing was accompanied by the names of his seven alleged bullies under the title: 'People who have bullied Connor, 28/1/15'.

Below it he wrote an open letter, which he showed in the video posted online.

It declared: 'Ever since I started at Montgomery, I've been bullied.

'People I don't know have bullied me. It hurts just to ignore them. I'm nearly in year eight now and since I told the teachers, they were no help at all.

'I just wanna stick up for myself but I can't, I'm not strong enough. PLEASE HELP! This has to stop!!!!'

The two-minute video of Connor reading extracts from his letter was shared more than 100 times on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times.

The schoolboy said: 'I was just getting sick of it, and after the last time it happened, I just got a piece of paper and started writing what I thought.

'I just hope people might leave me alone for once. I don't know why they do it - I think it's just me. They started saying stuff, saying I'm small and saying I'm gay.'

Connor's mother Francine Williams (left) said: 'It broke my heart when he sent me the video. He keeps coming home from school upset - he used to love school. Now he's had a lot of people telling him how brave he is'

Response: Staff at Montgomery High School in Blackpool have now been made aware of the video and have promised to put a stop to the problem. Headteacher Simon Brennand said: 'We are offering support'

Connor's mother Francine Williams, a network engineering graduate, said: 'It broke my heart when he sent me the video. He keeps coming home from school upset - he used to love school.

'He's had a lot of people who've seen the video, telling him how brave he is. 

'He's showing others they can speak out. The school has been quite helpful. They've spoken to me and it seems like they want things to change.

'He did come across a bit of problems when he was in primary school but he was able to show them how good he was when he did shows and he managed to win them over.

Connor said: 'I don't know why they do it. I just hope people might leave me alone for once'

'It took a while for him to gain their respect.

'Now, he tries to hide what he does because it just makes him a target

'There are no after-school dance clubs that he can join at school so he can meet like-minded kids and make it more acceptable.

'I did choose this high school because they had a good anti-bullying policy because I was scared that this would happen to Connor.

'Connor was dancing from being tiny, before he could walk he would be shaking his bum and then when he started walking he would dance about, listening to Christina Aguilera.

'As he got older it was Connor who asked if he could start dance classes. At first he went to street dance but then he got picked for the Primary Steps programme and we decided he should concentrate on that.

'He just loves to dance and wants to be on stage when he's older. He is a born entertainer.

'Connor is such a brilliant dancer. There is no way he will give it up for the bullies.' 

Ms Williams added she was pleased with the school's response, but felt more could have been done when bullying problems were reported previously.

Connor's school said it was not aware of the latest incident until the video was brought to the attention of staff.

Simon Brennand, headteacher of Montgomery High School, said: 'The school has got a robust policy to minimise bullying.

'It is a really high priority issue for us. Senior staff met with the pupil and his parents on Friday morning about the issue, which previously had not been brought to the attention of Montgomery staff.

'We are offering support. We would always encourage students and parents to share issues as soon as possible to enable them to be resolved.

'We care deeply about our young people - it matters to us that they feel happy and content.'
