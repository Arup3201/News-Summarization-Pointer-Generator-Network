A Florida woman is facing drug charges after trying to bring marijuana into a police car after an officer offered her a safe ride home.

The officer responded to a possible domestic abuse call at about 10.40pm in Orange City on Wednesday, where he found Michelle Sanford, 36, 'extremely intoxicated', according to the police report. 

Once it was determined that Sanford had not been struck by her boyfriend, Thomas Laudenslager, 46, the officer asked her if she had somewhere to stay and offered to drive her. 

Michelle Sanford, 36, was arrested on Wednesday night after asking a police officer if she could bring marijuana into a patrol car after she was offered a safe ride home

Sanford first brought clothes and an open beer to the patrol car, but the officer advised that she put the beer down, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal.

As that point, Laudenslager asked Sanford, 'Why don't you take your weed with you?' reports said. 

Sanford then turned to the officer and asked if she could take her marijuana with her in the car and smoke a joint at her father's house, according to the report. 

Sanford was arrested in Orange City (police department pictured) and ten to the Volusia County Jail. She is now out on bond

Laudenslager questioned by Sanford would say something that could send her to jail, to which she responded, 'It's just weed and he might be cool with it,' the police report said. 

After showing the marijuana to the officer, Sanford was arrested and charged with possession of paraphernalia and a misdemeanor drug offense. 

The officer also reportedly saw marijuana in the home's living room, according to Fox Orlando.

Sanford was taken to the Volusia County Jail but is out on bond.
