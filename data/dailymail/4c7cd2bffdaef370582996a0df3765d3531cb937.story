Keshi Anderson has impressed Alan Pardew so much the 19-year-old has been fast-tracked into Crystal Palace’s squad for their trip to Leicester City.

Anderson was earning £200 a month for non-League Barton Rovers only a week ago in the Southern League Division One — the football pyramid’s seventh tier.

Anderson’s 19 goals this season for Barton won him a trial at Brentford last week and in a friendly against Palace the striker netted a perfect six-minute hat-trick.

Manager Alan Pardew has been impressed by Anderson in the short time that he has been at Palace

Palace coaches saw enough to sign him for £30,000 on deadline day. He then netted on his Under 21s debut against Millwall.

He was called to train with the seniors on Thursday and Pardew has included him in Saturday’s squad.

‘The headlights are still full on for him,’ Pardew said. ‘He was just a player who came to our attention really quickly. There was a bit of interest from other clubs.

‘It’s a similar route I took myself coming from non-League. He has sympathetic eyes from me from that point of view.’

Anderson would do well to learn from the mistakes of team-mate Wilfried Zaha, who made his loan to Palace permanent for £6million on deadline day to end a torrid two years at Manchester United.

‘Manchester United is a big environment for a young footballer to go into,’ Pardew said. ‘He’s going to have to raise his game. This isn’t the Championship where he was a star. This is a level up and he needs to be a star at this level.’
