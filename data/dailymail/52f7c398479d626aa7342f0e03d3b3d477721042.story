When grandmother Kath Forster spotted a snake curled beneath Indian garden slates on her driveway, she calmly picked it up with ice cube tongs and trapped it in a box of Celebrations.

She might not have acted so decisively had she known exactly what she was tackling – for the 57-year-old had in fact just encountered one of the deadliest snakes in the world.

Mrs Forster’s experience at home in Dronfield, Derbyshire, is the second time in a week that a saw-scaled viper has been seen in England.

Snakes in a crate! Ms Forster snapped up the slippery stowaway with her trusty pair of tongs

Experts are now warning that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed by one of the snakes, because the authorities in India are not checking their shipments carefully. Yesterday, Mrs Forster described the moment she saw the snake in her front garden.

She was having work done at home and her gardener was unpacking a crate of patio slates from India when he saw a 20-inch snake curled at the bottom.

He told Mrs Forster and, with little hesitation, she reached in and grabbed the snake behind its head – as she had seen animal experts do on television.

‘He removed the last slab and there it was,’ she said. 

‘I came to see it and neighbours all came round and looked from an arm’s length.

‘I caught it and put it in a sweet container. Its tongue was out but I didn’t really look at it, it happened quickly.

‘We put the lid on the box but the box started moving. I wasn’t scared.’

The saw scaled viper has a lethal bite that can cause bleeding and brain hemorrhages

Mrs Forster, a housing officer, called a vet, who sent expert reptile handlers to collect the snake.  They called later to tell her just how dangerous the snake was, and the reptile is now with a licensed collector.‘I was very lucky,’ Mrs Forster added. ‘But I wouldn’t have wanted it to have injured anyone else so I’d do it again.’ 

Though they are not the most venomous, saw-scaled vipers are among the deadliest snakes in the world because they attack so often, with some reports saying they kill more than any other snake.

They live mainly in highly populated 
areas of Asia and Africa. Just one bite can be enough to kill, 
especially where treatment is not available. 

Expert John Bent said yesterday that 
it is only a matter of time before someone is killed if the vipers keep 
arriving in the UK in shipments from India.

‘The snakes are number one in the top
ten dangerous snakes because they are so aggressive,’ he said. ‘They 
strike faster than you can blink. It’s amazing no one was killed.

‘A saw-scaled viper is like a loaded gun with a hair trigger.

‘When I went to collect the snake, I asked: “Is this Indian slate?” And then, very quickly: “Where is it?”

‘In the car driving away it was jumping in the box on my wife’s knee. We got it home and put it in a tank and it was striking the glass to get at me. 

‘It was really feisty, even though it probably lost half its bodyweight from the journey.’ 

While it is extremely rare to see them in the UK, two sightings have been reported in the past week.

Another saw-scaled viper was seen in Tilbury Docks, in Essex, arriving in a giant shipping container from India.

Mr Bent said the snakes could survive up to six months trapped in a shipping container.

‘I don’t want to scaremonger but this is a time bomb,’ he added. 

‘There have been two in a week. They are getting through and if they colonise here we’re in deep trouble.’
