Britain has David Cameron enthusing about his date nights with wife Samantha.

America has the Obamas happily puckering up for the kiss cam at a baseball match.And North Korea – well, North Korea has the announcement that its leader has a wife.

The country’s official state broadcaster made the revelation after weeks of speculation over the identity of a woman who has been seen accompanying Kim Jong-un at recent engagements.

It named her as ‘Comrade Ri So-Ju’, and she is believed to be in her twenties or early thirties.

By the notoriously secretive standards of the communist state, it’s practically a Hello magazine world exclusive.

The announcement is the first insight the world has had into the private life of Kim, 28.

State television said Miss Ri took part in a ceremony marking the completion of a Pyongyang amusement park.

It released a photo of her walking alongside Kim, wearing a red polka dot jacket and smiling nervously.

North Korean watchers in South Korea 
had previously said the woman might be Hyon Song-wol, a former singer 
with the Bochonbo Electronic Music Band.

Intelligence agencies had suggested 
Kim and the pop singer first became romantically involved ten years ago,
 after he returned home from his studies at a private academy in 
Switzerland.

It was claimed that Kim’s late father,
 Kim Jong-il, had ordered him to end the relationship, and she ended up 
marrying an officer in the North Korean army instead.

Other educated guesses suggested the mystery woman might be a younger sister.

South Korea’s unification ministry 
said yesterday that it appeared Miss Ri was the woman who had been 
pictured several times at Kim’s side at public events in recent weeks.

Photos aired by state television 
recently showed her standing beside Kim during a visit to a 
kindergarten, smiling as he hugged and talked to children.

Kim, the world’s youngest head of state, became leader last December following the death of his father.
