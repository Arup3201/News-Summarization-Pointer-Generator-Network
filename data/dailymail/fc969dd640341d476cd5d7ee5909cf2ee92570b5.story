Victim: A court heard that Fico Dougan (pictured) was murdered with a kitchen knife after the defendant said rap music 'made him want to stab somebody'

A teenager murdered an acquaintance with a kitchen knife in front of a toddler after saying that rap music made him 'want to stab somebody', a court heard.

The 16-year-old, who can not be named for legal reasons, is accused of launching an unprovoked attack on Fico Dougan, 17.

The fatal stab wound was inflicted with such force that it entered through his chest, passed through a chest bone and emerged from his back, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

Fico died of a stab wound to the heart soon after the attack on September 25 last year, which took place in front of a two-year-year girl at a house in Croydon, south London, the court was told.

The accused teenager's defence barrister argues the killing was triggered by post-traumatic stress disorder following the death of his much-loved brother.

Martin Hicks, prosecuting, told the court that the alleged murderer and Fico knew each other but 'there was no known hostility'.

The pair had both been at the house of a 19-year-old woman on the afternoon of the killing, and she, the defendant, and Fico's girlfriend Montana Riley were watching television with the woman's two-year-old sister.

Mr Hicks said: 'The defendant was listening to music on his headphones. He was heard to say words to the effect of, "When I listen to rap music I want to stab somebody".’

Soon after, Fico tapped at the window and was let into the house by Miss Riley and joined the group watching TV, the jury was told.

Fewer than ten minutes later, the defendant rose from his seat and walking to the kitchen with what Miss Riley described as 'a vague stare'.

Mr Hicks told the court: 'He burst back into the room and he was holding a kitchen knife. Without any warning and with no good reason he proceeded to attack Fico.'

The court heard the defendant remained completely silent as he tried to stab Fico at least six times while Miss Riley frantically attempted to stop him.

He fled the house and boarded a bus to his home, where he allegedly tried to set his clothing alight.

In footage of a police interview shown to the court, Miss Riley said she had never known the defendant to be violent.

She told detectives the teenager had been listening to music on his mobile phone in the hours before the attack.

She told them: 'He said, "When I listen to depressing songs I feel depressed, when I listen to love songs I feel sexually frustrated, and when I listen to rap music I want to stab up someone’s face".

'He started clenching his fist. I thought it was weird but you don’t think he actually would. He did not look serious.'

Family: Tragic Fico with his sister Effeh. Paramedics had battled to save his life but he died in hospital

Miss Riley also recalled her attempts to save Fico’s life.

She said: 'He came out of nowhere and leapt over [the 19-year-old woman] to get to Fico. He was just stabbing Fico constantly. I tried to get between them and stop him.

'He looked like he was trying to stab his face so I had my hands over his face and his heart.

'I was trying to talk to Fico and to see if he was breathing but he wasn’t responding. His eyes had rolled back.'

Tributes: Flowers and tributes left outside the home where 17-year-old Fico was stabbed

Paramedics battled to save Fico’s life, but he died in hospital.

The defendant denies murder. His defence lawyer, David Nathan, will argue for a lesser conviction of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to post-traumatic stress disorder.

Mr Nathan told the court the defendant’s brother, with whom he was 'very close', had died in the weeks before Fico’s death.

The court heard he had drunk a bottle of vodka the night before the killing, leaving him so drunk he threw up.

The trial continues.
