Russian president Vladimir Putin met the
 Pope today - amid claims he is planning to name scandal-mired Silvio 
Berlusconi as Russia's ambassador to the Vatican.

The pair have defended each other through thick and thin, so the move is hardly surprising for the ever-controversial pair.

The Russian president has attended the Italian’s infamous bunga bunga parties while Mr Putin reciprocated with holidays at his dacha on the Black Sea.

Friends: It has been claimed Vladimir Putin, left, who met the Pope in Rome's Vatican City, reportedly wants to make disgraced Silvio Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador - giving him diplomatic immunity

They have attended extreme fighting events together and Mr Putin even has a bed named after him at the 77-year-old billionaire’s mansion.

Now their unlikely bond has taken a new turn, with Mr Putin said to be poised to make the former Italian prime minister the Russian envoy to the Vatican. Such a move would confer diplomatic immunity on Berlusconi – and an escape from his latest legal woes courtesy of his old pal in the Kremlin.

After being convicted of tax fraud, the politician is this week facing expulsion from the Italian parliament, a move that would strip him of some legal protection.

Putin is on a two-day visit in Italy. He will also meet with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano and Premier Enrico Letta

The three-time premier had hoped for a last minute pardon but Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has made it clear that this is not on his agenda.

He is also appealing against a conviction  for sex with underage prostitute Ruby ‘the heart-stealer’, and faces a new trial for an alleged £2.5million bribe to a senator.

As well as legal immunity, the  post would give Berlusconi a diplomatic passport, allowing him to visit his luxury overseas properties – something he has been denied since his old passport was  cancelled by the authorities.

Although the two have clashed over Syria, they agree that outside military intervention will escalate the civil war

Former KGB agent Mr Putin was last night arriving in Rome to meet Pope Francis and Italian ministers but he is also scheduled to meet Berlusconi.

A political source told an Italian newspaper: ‘Putin’s idea is clear: he plans to nominate Berlusconi as ambassador to the Holy See, a strategy that would save him from persecution by the judiciary.’

Mr Putin held private talks with Pope Francis about the Syrian conflict, months after the Pope sent him an angry letter criticising the G20's failure to provide more aid.

In
 September the Pope wrote directly to Putin imploring him to co-operate 
with other international leaders to help the people of Syria.

Cosy: Berlusconi and Putin are firm friends, despite both being controversial figures on the world stage

So far the reports that Putin, left, could make Berlusconi, right, a Russian ambassador are unconfirmed

Pope Francis and Putin did agree on one thing, however - they were both against the British and U.S. push for military intervention.

Putin refused to take sides in the conflict, while the Pope said it was important that the violence did not escalate.

But the pair differ publicly in several areas including on gay rights. While the Pope has reportedly taken a softer line, Putin has cracked down on gay rights and criminalised protests in favour.

And there is a long-running religious feud between the Vatican and the Russian Orthodox church, which have been at loggerheads since the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian church figures have accused the Vatican of trying to convert their worshippers to make them Catholic.
