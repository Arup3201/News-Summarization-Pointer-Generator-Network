Brazil got off to a winning start in their World Cup opener against Croatia at Arena de Sao Paulo. Their 3-1 win sets them up perfectly ahead of the tournament they are favourites for, but were they as up to scratch as the scoreline suggests? MATT LAWTON gives his ratings.

Star: Neymar shined for Brazil as they beat Croatia in their opening World Cup game

BRAZIL (4-3-2-1)

JULIO CESAR: 6

Didn’t have an enormous amount to do, which is probably the way Scolari likes it for his Toronto FC goalkeeper.

DANI ALVES: 5.5

The Barcelona full-back looked distinctly out-of-sorts at times. A nervous start to say the least.

THIAGO SILVA: 6

Decent in possession, passing the ball more than any other player in that frantic first half.

DAVID LUIZ: 6

A solid, composed start from the Chelsea defender. But at times he Thiago Silva looked stretched.

MARCELO: 5.5

Horrible start and the ignominy of becoming the first Brazilian to score an own goal in a World Cup. Recovered well though.

Frustration: Marcelo recovered well after a horrible start with an own goal

PAULINHO: 6

Some surging runs from midfield and a couple of decent shots. Tried to make things happen.

OSCAR: 7.5

Beat two men before providing the ball from which Neymar scored. Showed lots of ambition even if he did lose the ball too easily at times. Fine performance crowned by the goal of the night to cap Brazil's victory late on.

Brazil: Beat two men before providing the ball from which Neymar scored, and showed ambition.

LUIZ GUSTAVO: 7

Brazil’s midfield enforcer struggled to contain Modric and Co at times but passed the ball well.

HULK: 6

His partnership with Neymar is supposed to be key to Brazil’s success but had a relatively quiet game.

NEYMAR: 8

Flashes of brilliance and a goal that sent this stadium into ecstasy. A foolish booking for a clash with Modric aside, he carried the hopes of a nation well.

FRED: 6.5

The one member of Brazil’s starting line-up who plays his football in South America competed well as their centre forward.

Winner: Neymar scores the winning goal from the penalty spot against Croatia at the Arena de Sao Paulo

CROATIA (4-2-3-1)

PLETIKOSA: 5

Brilliant save to deny Oscar in the first half but might have been frustrated to concede to Neymar given the pace of the shot. Got a strong hand to Neymar's penalty but will be disappointed to concede Oscar's long-range shot late on.

Angry: Pletikosa reacts after allowing a goal from the penalty spot against Neymar which he could have saved

SRNA: 6.5

Croatia’s captain often had to cope with the pressure of marking Neymar. But kept Hulk quiet when he popped up on that flank.

CORLUKA: 7

A solid display from Croatia’s centre-half, his job often to keep Fred quiet. He did it pretty well.

LOVREN: 6.5

Like his fellow centre-half, the Southampton man stood up well against Brazilian pressure.

VRSALJKO: 6

Had his work cut out when Oscar was running at him. A tough night for the Croatia full-back.

MODRIC: 7

Some electric running from midfield and some super passing and movement. Quality player.

Bright spark: Modric had some electric running from midfielder and showed superb passing and movement

RAKITIC: 7

A cynical foul on Neymar but battled well alongside Modric in that midfield battle zone. Good movement too.

PERISIC: 6.5

Terrific cross should have led to an early goal for Croatia. Certainly kept Marcelo busy and full of running.

Battle: Perisic (left) and his terrific cross should have led to an early goal for Croatia but he kept Marcelo (right) busy

KOVACIC: 6

Chief supplier to Jelavic often had to deal with the close attention of Luiz Gustavo.

OLIC: 6

Bad miss in the seventh miss after super cross from Perisic. But provided the teasing cross that led to Marcelo’s own goal. Allowed Dani Alves too much space though.

JELAVIC: 6

Probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off Marcelo but battled well as the lone striker.

Chase: Jelavic probably should have done better with the finish that ended up bouncing in off Marcelo but battled well

Man of the match: Neymar.

Referee: Yuichi Nishimura (Japan): 4

Two shocking decisions that had an impact on the game. Wrong over the penalty when Dejan Lovren fouled Fred and soft on the foul on Julio Cesar that denied Croatia a goal late on.

Man of the match: Neymar was outstanding for Brazil in their 3-1 win
