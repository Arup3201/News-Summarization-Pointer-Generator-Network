A Kentucky man who is touring the United States to honor his brother's dying wish - surprising lucky waiters and waitresses with whopping $500 tips - has just made his 56th moving gesture.

Aaron Collins passed away a year ago aged just 30, but in his will he told his family: 'Leave an awesome tip... I mean $500 on a f****** pizza.'

His older brother, Seth Collins, created a website and started raising money to carry out the kind act. Instead of $500, Seth raised over $60,000 from generous donors, and he is now on a U.S. road trip.

On Thursday he shocked Vanessa Goldschmidt, a waitress in Pequod's Pizza in Chicago, with huge tip on a $45 tab. This was the 56th donation.

The family say enough money has been raised through the website and donation page for Seth to hand out a $500 surprise weekly for the next two years.Â 

In Chicago, Goldschmidt was taken aback by the gift after first expressing sympathy for the Collins family's loss.

'I'm like shaking right now. Are you kidding? Oh, my gosh. I'm shaking right now. That's amazing,' the waitress said before grabbing Seth in a hug.

'It was just like another Thursday night, coming into work, hoping for the best. It's a slow night,' Goldschmidt told the Chicago Tribune. 'I'm just taken aback. It's such an amazing gesture.'

Tragic: Aaron Collins died in July 2012, aged just 30

Seth has so far traveled over 2,300 miles and gifted over $3,000 in surprise gratuities. Milwaukee, St Paul and Des Moines are his next stops.

Aaron was a computer technician in Lexington, Kentucky and held a bachelor's degree in construction management.

Aaron
passed away on July 7, 2012, and while the website does not say how he 
died, Seth Collins describes his brother on it as 'the type of person 
that took great joy in unexpected kindness.'

In the first video ever, a young waitress 
working at Puccini's Smiling Teeth in Lexington, Kentucky, was shocked 
when Collins handed over the $500 wad of cash.

He later posted the emotional moment on YouTube and the video went viral.

Now Collins is on a mission to pass on the gigantic gratuities to servers across the rest of the nation.

He is taping each heartfelt reaction to his generosity.

Collins believes he will visit up to 100 restaurants in all 50 states, he told the New York Daily News.

The
time-consuming but rewarding experience was most moving, he said, when 
he visited Pies & Pints Pizzeria in Charleston, West Virginia.

The server who happened to be assigned to his table had just lost his mother two weeks before and Collins was pleased he could, in some small way, make him happy.

'The passing of my brother gave him something special and made him happy so soon after the loss of his mother,' Collins told the Daily News.

Collins, who has two younger sisters, said Aaron has been on his mind each and every time, and his dying wish had taught him an important lesson he is hoping will rub off.

'It's definitely reminded me of how important it is to be generous,' Collins said.
