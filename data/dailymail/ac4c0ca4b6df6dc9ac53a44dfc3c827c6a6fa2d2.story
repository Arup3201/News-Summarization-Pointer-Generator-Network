Oil paintings of women who once featured in an advertising campaign for chocolate brand Aero were hung on Rowntree's York factory walls for decades.

Now the company, which was taken over by Nestlé in 1988, wants to solve the mystery of who the women were before it's too late.

The brand has launched a nationwide search to find the models who posed for the paintings in the Fifties.

Post war campaign: The adverts using regular women as models aimed to show that chocolate was for everyone and not a luxury item

Alex Hutchinson, archive curator at Nestlé explained: 'We are very interested in finding out
who the women are in the pictures to put names to faces that have had a
large presence in the company over the years.

'The paintings are part of the history of our company and because we don't know who they are, we only know half the story.

For all: The oil paintings were reproduced in adverts in newspapers and magazines telling people Aero milk chocolate is 'different'

'We don't know anything about these woman
who became the Aero Girls, and we would like to track them down. They 
will all be in their 80s now so this could be the last chance.'

Aero first went on sale in 1935 but ceased production during World War Two when the nation faced food shortages and rationing. 

When the makers relaunched Aero in 1951, chocolate was still considered an expensive item. They needed an advertising campaign to show the public that the bubbly treat was 
available to anyone.

Artists were commissioned to create expensive oil paintings of regular women with the slogan 'Different... For her, Aero - the milk chocolate that's different!'

Who's the girl? The models will now be in their Eighties but little is known about them

Mr Hutchinson said the adverts were innovative at the time as they were presented in a 'completely different style 
to what the country was used to'. The models are thought to be family and friends of the artists but there is limited information about them.

He added: 'During
the war everything was very stylised and cartoon like but for some 
reason they decided to make these adverts in a completely different way.

'Using
oil paintings was unusual because they would have been expensive to 
reproduce, it would be the equivalent of having a poster made in gold 
leaf today.

Mystery: The women are thought to be friends and relatives of the commissioned artists

'They were almost hitting back after the rationing throughout the war by using such an extravagant campaign.

'Rowntree's
commissioned famous artists at the time to paint the portraits who used
normal women as their models, they could have been relatives or 
friends.

'We are hoping if we find the women in the poster campaign we can work out what the thought process was behind it.'

Do you know who they are? The brand is keen to find out as the paintings have been part of its York factory for decades

The original oil paintings were hung in a corridor leading to the cake department of the original Rowntree's factory in York.

When the company moved its production lines in 200,6 some of the oil paintings were removed and taken to auction. Others have become lost over time and, of the original 40, only 20 remain today.

Now the company wants to track down the models in the paintings to help with missing details about the advertisements.

The paintings will go on display for the first time outside of the factory in an exhibition by the Borthwick Institute for Archives in York.
