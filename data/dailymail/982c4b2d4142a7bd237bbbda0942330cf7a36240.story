This is not a drill. The first real polar vortex of the season is expected to hit the East Coast in full force Thursday and Friday, bringing a blast of arctic air capable of setting all-time February temperature lows from the deep South to Virginia.

The polar vortex is a usually rare phenomenon whereby air circling the North Pole is pushed down into North America. 

Last year, the East Coast experienced just two instances of polar vortex, but they were such scarring experiences that the term was floated around for any bout of cold weather the entire season.   

But this time it's back for real. A polar vortex system has been moving down from the North Pole all week and has already arrived in parts of the Midwest. 

It's back: Just when you thought it couldn't get any colder: A polar vortex system will blow in from the North Pole on Thursday to bring record low temperatures to much of the eastern United States 

 Long winter: The northeastern U.S. - especially Boston, Massachusetts  - have been struggling to keep up with a constant barrage of snow. Niagara Falls in Upstate New York is pictured partially frozen over on Tuesday

By Thursday morning, the system will move further south into Appalachia and the western Mid-Atlantic. 

Kentucky is expected to receive the brunt of the frigid weather, with temperatures likely to dip 40 degree below normal.

Meanwhile, Washington DC hasn't experienced below zero temperatures for February 19 since 1994, and the vortex is expected to break that lull as well. 

Temperatures in the capital have been hovering in the teens lately, leading the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal to freeze over.  

But the vortex is saving the worst of it's punch for Friday, when sub-zero temperatures will wipe the region from Ohio to West Virginia and up into the Mid-Atlantic.

Eye of the cold: The arctic blast is expected to start Thursday and hit the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Virginia the hardest 

No TGIF: The worst of the polar vortex will be reserved for Friday, when most of the Midwest is expected to shiver in sub-zero temperatures 

Michigan, Indiana, southern Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and far western Virginia are forecasting morning lows of minus 20 degrees. 

Meanwhile the Weather Channel predicts that Cincinnati, Ohio; Knoxville, Tennessee; Roanoake, Virginia and Charleston, West Virginia will also break temperature records for that day.

The low temperature record for DC for February 20 was set all the way back in 1896, with 8-degrees but that should be easily quashed. 

Adding to the pain will be windy conditions, with wind chill warnings issued across most of the Eastern U.S. 

Rutgers University climatologist Dave Robinson described the vortex as 'essentially the coolest air found in the Northern Hemisphere'. 

'It's situated up in the Arctic in the bulk of the winter. But occasionally, a lobe of that will dip south above the jet stream and allow that cold air down into the Middle Atlantic states,' Robinson explained to CBS News.

East Coast dwellers will remember their old nemesis well. Last year, the polar vortex caused wide-spread drops in temperature, several feet of snow, and the associated chaos of power outages, cancelled flights, and school closures.
