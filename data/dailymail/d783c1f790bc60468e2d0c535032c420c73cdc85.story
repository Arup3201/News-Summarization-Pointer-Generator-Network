Rail passengers in Britain pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their European neighbours, figures reveal today.

They come as passengers brace themselves for a fresh round of fare rises of up to 11 per cent from Monday, and against a background of worsening train punctuality.

Critics say consumers are being ‘ripped off’ by an alliance of greedy train companies and tax-hungry Treasury ministers while passengers on the Continent pay significantly less for their journeys.

Rail passengers in Britain pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their European neighbours, figures reveal today

A report by the Campaign for Better Transport shows British train passengers pay three-and-a-half times more than even the most expensive equivalent commuter journey of 21-24 miles highlighted on the other side of the Channel.

It says a 2011 annual season ticket for the journey from Woking to London, including Tube travel in the capital, costs £3,268.

Yet a similar 22-mile trip from Velletri to Rome costs Italian season ticket holders just £336.17 – nearly a tenth of the price.

In France, a season ticket for the 24-mile trip from Ballancourt-sur-Essonne to Paris costs £924.66 – a third of the UK fare.

The cost of a season ticket on the  21-mile Strausberg-to-Berlin route in Germany is £705.85, while the 22-mile journey from Collado Villalba to Madrid costs Spanish season ticket holders £653.74.

The CBT’s figures include the cost of travel on each city’s underground system.

The group’s Sophie Allain said: ‘When the cost of season tickets is so much higher than other European capitals, the fare rises are starting to affect the UK’s competitiveness.

'We still have the highest fares in Europe, and they will be around 24 per cent higher by the next election.’

The Association of Train Operating Companies described the study as ‘a flimsy piece of research that does not stand up to scrutiny, focusing on just one season ticket out of tens of thousands available’.

But the RMT transport union boss Bob Crow said it was ‘more proof that UK passengers are getting robbed blind by a combination of train operator greed and government incompetence’.

On Monday, more than 100million inflation-busting New Year rail fares go ‘live’, with an average rise – covering both regulated and unregulated fares – of 5.9 per cent.

Regulated fares, which include  season tickets and make up around 40 per cent of the total, will rise by an average of 6 per cent.

But train companies have ‘flexibility’  to add another 5 per cent – making 11 per cent rises possible – provided other fares come down to compensate and keep the ‘average’ at 6 per cent.

The basic 6 per cent rise in regulated fares is set by the Government and based on the July 2011 RPI inflation figure plus 1 per cent.

Ministers had planned to increase the fare cap to RPI plus 3 per cent, but this was reversed by George Osborne’s autumn statement in November.

However, it is expected to apply from January 2013.

On unregulated fares, which make up around 60 per cent of the total, there is no limit on rises.

One of the highest increases – 8 per cent – will see a Brighton to London season ticket, including travel on the capital’s underground, rise from £4,304 to £4,644.

And commuters from Swindon to London who include Tube travel in their season tickets will be hit with a 6 per cent rise from £7,592 to £8,048.

ATOC chief executive Michael Roberts defended the rises, saying ‘money raised through fares helps pay for new trains, faster services and better stations’.

The Department for Transport said it recognised the ‘pressure on family budgets’ and cited the decision to keep regulated fare rises at RPI plus 1 per cent, but added: ‘Revenue from fares is helping to deliver one of the biggest programmes of rail capacity improvements for 100 years.’

Last week, the Office of Rail Regulation took enforcement action against  Network Rail for worsening punctuality, with one train in eight (13 per cent)  running late.
