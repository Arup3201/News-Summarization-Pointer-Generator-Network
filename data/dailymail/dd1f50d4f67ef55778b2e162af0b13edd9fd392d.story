She's a champion pole vaulter who's represented Australia at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.

But now 20-year-old athlete Liz Parnov is forging a second career in modelling after she was approached by a talent agent while at a 21st birthday party in Perth.

The beautiful pole vaulter recently suffered a heart-breaking defeat at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games after she failed to register a mark in the final, slipping on the wet track.

That pain is now being channeled into her pursuits in front of the camera after being scouted by renowned starmaker Christine Fox, who has helped launch the careers of Gemma Ward and Nicole Trunfio.

Pole vaulter turned model, Liz Parnov is ready to take on the modelling world

Although she'd always dreamed of such an opportunity, she never thought it would become a reality. Now she's setting her sights on a different kind of spotlight - with WA agency Vivien's Model Management.

'I've always wanted to try it but I didn't think my body type would be right because I have more of an athletic body,' she told Daily Mail Australia, 'so when Christine [Fox] approached me I was in shock.'

'I think the more athletic body type is coming in,' she said.

Originally from Russia, Ms Parnov is all too grateful for the opportunities her life in Australia has given her.

'I go back to Russia every year and everytime I'm there, I just think how lucky I am to live in Australia and get to do what I love,' she said, 'specially with this new opportunity, it's unreal.'

The Olympic athlete never thought that modelling would be a career move due to her athletic build

The multi-talented beauty has already gone to a casting with her portfolio filled with stunning photos from her test shoot.

'I've only really done one photo shoot, for my test shots so the casting for Perth Fashion Festival was nerve wracking,' she explains.

'I got a call back so hopefully it all goes well and I get to do my first runway.'

When asked if the modelling world is anything like television shows such as Australia's Next Top Model or The Face, she laughs: 'I suppose it is and it isn't.'

Liz hopes to break into fitness, swimsuit and commercial modelling all while training for her main passion pole vaulting and also going to university

'The first time I walked into the agency and saw the lobby with all the girls comp cards and editorials I thought it was.'

And although she's used to the rigours of training for professional sport, she admits she finds preparing for life on the catwalk just as challenging.

'I think it's great that I get to go to healthy eating and fitness classes with the younger girls from Vivien's. It teaches them how to look after their bodies and go into modelling the right way by eating right and keeping fit.'

From training sneakers to stilettos, Liz Parnov is prepared for the gruelling training involved in becoming a fashion model

The young Olympian has just started her pre-season training for the World Championships in Athletics held in Beijing next year.

She doesn't at all seem phased by having to add to her already busy schedule.

'I started my pre-season training yesterday and I'm also back at uni. I think like anything adding modelling into the mix. I'll need to find a balance and it will be fine. I'll take it as it comes.'
