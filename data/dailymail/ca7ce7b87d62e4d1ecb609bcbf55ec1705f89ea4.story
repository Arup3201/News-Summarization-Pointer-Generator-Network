ONE DAY AS A TIGER by John Porter (Vertebrate £20) 

This is a book about mountains and lost youth, by a man who is no longer young, but who remembers only too fiercely what it was like.

And it’s not just about lost youth in general, but a particular lost youth. Alex Macintyre was a shining star of British mountaineering in the late 1970s.

He had the looks, he had the vast mop of curly hair, he had the talent, bravery and ambition. And, in 1982, as he climbed the south face of Annapurna, a single stone fell from on high and hit him on the head, killing him instantly. He was 28.

Mountaineering, as we know, is not the safest sport in the world. Alex himself told a girlfriend that, whenever he went off to the Alps or the Himalayas, there was a one in ten chance he would not come back.

Even so, there was something brutally random about this particular end. One day, if you’re unlucky, your number will come up, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do about it. John Porter knew Alex well and climbed with him many times. They met at Leeds University, then — as now — a hub of mountaineering obsessiveness and excellence.

Porter, born in Massachusetts, was a postgraduate and eight years Alex’s senior, but seems to have seen Alex surpass him without jealousy or rancour. He has been thinking about writing this book, and then finally writing it, for very many years.

The great Reinhold Messner described him as ‘the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in Himalaya’

‘Alex was in many ways unique,’ says Maria Coffey, the author of several books about the psychological and emotional implications of the sport. ‘He stood out from everyone else. He definitely had a glimmer.’

The great Reinhold Messner, whom even I have heard of, described him at the time as ‘the purest exponent of the lightweight style now climbing in Himalaya’. ‘Lightweight’, in this context, meant climbing in small teams of three, four, or five, carrying as little as possible, and climbing fast in order to make the great back-up systems of traditional expeditions unnecessary.

Chris Bonnington, the most famous mountaineer then (and probably still), made his reputation by setting up large, well-prepared expeditions that attacked peaks with almost military intent. Such expeditions often had so many porters, they had to hire extra porters to carry enough food for the original porters.

What made the expeditions possible was a series of technological improvements in mountaineering equipment, but also, bluntly, the will to do it.

Mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature, and not surprisingly: its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite

Alex, says Porter, ‘had a desire to conceive bold projects above and beyond the ordinary’. They were young, it was the 1970s, everything was possible. Only just, though. Money was perpetually scarce, sponsorship minimal. On long train journeys across Europe and Asia, equipment was always getting lost and impounded.

Officials needed to be bribed, some with hard currency, others with bottles of scotch that had been smuggled along for the purpose. And there were more ways of losing your life than falling off mountains.

One team of three, on the long trek back to civilisation after completing their mission, settled down for the night in their sleeping bags. When the one in the middle woke in the morning, he was surprised to see his two fellows had exchanged positions in the night.

But they hadn’t. Someone had come along, chopped both their heads off and swapped them over.

The books is generously illustrated with 75 photos, in colour and black-and-white, of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks (stock photo

Porter describes a small, incestuous world in which everybody knew everybody else and had often slept with each other’s girlfriends.

‘As a community, it is self-absorbed, fuelled with adrenaline on the crags and with alcohol in the evenings, no different to any other small, tight-knit group living on the edge.’

At the end of the book, he gives a list of those who died along the way. This golden generation, most of whom would now be in their 60s, all but climbed themselves to extinction.

Mountaineering has inspired a considerable literature, and not surprisingly: its exponents routinely contemplate the infinite, and many of them are still wondering what to make of it all when they hang up their crampons.

Porter’s fine and intelligent book has just won the Grand Prize at the Banff Mountain Book Festival, which is big news in the world of adventure and environmental publishing.

It’s also generously illustrated with 75 photos, in colour and black-and-white, of these terrifying young people scaling these impossible peaks, living in the moment, as you have to, because the past has gone and the future might never arise.
