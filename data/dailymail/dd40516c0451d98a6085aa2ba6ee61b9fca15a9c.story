Paula Hamilton was detained by a tracker dog

The brakes went on Paula Hamilton’s high-flying career years ago.

But the downfall of the former model – who found fame starring in an iconic car TV commercial – appeared complete yesterday as she was banned from driving after drunkenly crashing into a neighbour’s conservatory.

In an illustration of just how bizarre her life has become, the 51-year-old seemed more concerned about how she was addressed in court than the offence itself.

She took particular exception to presiding magistrate Philip Dobson calling her ‘Mrs’ rather than Miss Hamilton.

Speaking from the dock at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court in Buckinghamshire, she said: ‘Sorry, I must correct you, it’s Miss Hamilton. I have not been married sadly.’

The comment is a little puzzling. She is on record as having wed cameraman Danny Mindel in 1987 in a union that lasted two-and-a-half years.

Miss Hamilton was the glamorous face of Volkswagen cars in the Eighties.

She is most famous for a 1987 advert in which she was seen leaving a house, ripping off her pearls, fur coat and her wedding ring, but keeping the keys to a VW Golf.

‘If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen,’ ran the tagline.

Sadly, her own life has been lacking in such reliability. After failed relationships, cocaine and drink addictions, and years of therapy, she reached a new low in the late-night car crash on September 4 this year in which she  lost her front teeth.

The court heard the crash happened at 4am  when her green-coloured Hyundai car veered off the road just 200 yards from her home in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire.

Former supermodel Paula Hamilton (left after the crash this year, right in 1991 when she was discovered by David Bailey) claimed in court she was 'mauled' by a police dog when it found her after the crash in September

She demolished a garden fence and smashed into the newly-built £20,000 conservatory of her 68-year-old neighbour.

Peter Bird, prosecuting, said paramedics could not find the driver with the wreckage of the car, and alerted police.

A police dog discovered Hamilton 
collapsed in an alleyway nearby, said Mr Bird. She later claimed the 
animal had ‘mauled’ her. The court heard the dog inflicted some ‘some 
bruising’.

A sample of Hamilton’s blood showed that she had 106mg of alcohol – the legal limit is 80mg – per 100ml of her blood.

Troubled life: Miss Hamilton's life began to unravel as she fought battles against alcohol and cocaine (pictured left in 1991 and right in 1994)

Tragedy has dogged Paula Hamilton from birth. The product of an affair her mother had with a family friend, John Johnson – who was battered to death in a drunken brawl in 1976 – she had four younger half-siblings.

She never settled in at school and left at 16, but not before losing her virginity to Simon Cowell.

They were childhood sweethearts while growing up in Hertfordshire in the 1970s, and she said that, in contrast to his ‘Mr Nasty’ image on TV, he was ‘very, very protective’.

She is most famous for her iconic VW ad in 1987, when she was 27, in which she was made up to look like Princess Diana. But she was also the main model of the Queen’s couturier Sir Hardy Amies and a muse of royal photographer Lord Lichfield.

Her life began to unravel as she fought battles against alcohol and cocaine, and she emigrated to New Zealand in 2000 after racking up a series of convictions for drink-driving.

After moving back to Britain in 2006, she became a judge on reality TV series Britain’s Next Top Model.

She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in that year, but in 2007 it was revealed she was in fact suffering from dyspraxia, a condition that affects coordination.

Two weeks later, Miss Hamilton 
claimed in a press interview that she had swerved to avoid hitting deer 
in the road. She was quoted as saying: ‘I’ve lost my front teeth and 
I’m in huge amounts of pain, but it was worth it to save that mother 
deer and her baby.’

Miss Hamilton, who is having dental 
work costing £15,000, explained driving at 4am by saying she had been 
heading to a spot near her home in search of nettles, which she blends 
into smoothies or makes into soup.

‘I often go nettle hunting and I keep irregular hours, so if the urge takes me I just go,’ she said.

Later, in a police interview, she 
answered mainly no comment despite admitting to officers she had told 
the press she was involved in the accident.

But in court yesterday, Miss Hamilton
claimed she could not remember getting into the car at all, nor leaving
it after the crash.

David Hicks, defending, explained 
that his client had been in a pub before the crash, suggesting she had 
gone there to help with her conditions such as dyslexia. He said she had
been diagnosed with dyslexia, dyspraxia and Asperger’s syndrome – a 
form of autism – at the age of 47, and as a result was ‘encouraged to 
seek social occasions’.

‘On this occasion she attended a public house,’ said Mr Hicks.

He added: ‘She has no recollection of
getting back into the car after walking home from the public house, and
does not recall leaving the vehicle before the police arrived.’

He said Hamilton wanted to put ‘the mistake behind her’ and ‘realises that she made an error of judgment’.

At times, dark-haired Hamilton, 
wearing a smart navy coat and brown scarf, appeared to struggle to hear 
what was being said as she sat in the dock. Magistrate Mr Dobson 
disqualified her from driving for 14 months. He also ordered her to pay a
£160 fine, a £15 ‘victim surcharge’ and court costs of £85.

She was told her driving ban could be reduced by three months if she took part in a drink-driver rehabilitation course.

Discovered by photographer David Bailey, Hamilton was one of the modelling stars of the 1980s.

At the height of her success, she had
an affair with the billionaire former Conservative party vice-chairman 
Lord  Ashcroft, and in the 1990s  was engaged to film-maker Henry Cole.

She also had flings with former 
England cricketer Ed Giddins and a former Life Guards Captain called 
Sebastian Rhodes-Stampa, who proposed but then left her two days later.
