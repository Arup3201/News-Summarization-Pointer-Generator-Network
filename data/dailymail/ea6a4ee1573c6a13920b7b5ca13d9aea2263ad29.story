New hire: Kim Stolz, 29, is Citigroup's newest vice president of equaty-derivative sales

Citigroup, one of America’s largest banking institutions, has hired former America’s Next Top Model contestant and MTV host Kim Stolz as its newest equity-derivative sales vice president, according to two unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Stolz, 29, worked in the equity-derivatives field for the global equity trading firm BTIG before taking the job with Citigroup, according to the sources cited by Bloomberg.

Equity derivatives are contracts whose values are based on underlying securities, such as common stock.

Before her career in high finance got off the ground, Stolz took a crack at high fashion, finishing fifth in cycle five of the popular reality show hosted by supermodel Tyra Banks that aired in 2005.

Stolz is best remembered for being one of the first openly game women on the show, and she went on to co-create a lesbian blog called OutNYLez.

Her stint on America’s Next Top Model propelled her to MTV stardom, where she worked as an anchor from June 2006 to June 2010. She has also worked for Ford Models and has contributed The Huffington Post.

As a fashion model, Stolz appeared in ads for American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch and Nordstrom, and was featured on the cover of Women's Wear Daily.

According to her LinkedIn profile, Stolz switched gears and returned to finance in June of 2010, when she took a job with BTIG. 

In 2004, Stolz interned at Goldman Sachs, according to Finra records and her LinkedIn page. The following year, she graduated from the prestigious Wesleyan University with a bachelor’s degree in government and international politics.

She wrote a senior thesis titled ‘The Impact of Exit Strategies of United States Intervention in the Post-Cold War Era,’ for which she received honors, according to the her LinkedIn page.

Stolz also is the author of the upcoming book Can’t Stop: Why We’re Obsessed with Social Media -- And What to Do About It,’ which is scheduled to be published in February.

In her new position, Stolz will likely be called upon to help bolster Citigroup’s slumping equities business after it lost 40 per cent in revenue in the 12 months ended June 30.
