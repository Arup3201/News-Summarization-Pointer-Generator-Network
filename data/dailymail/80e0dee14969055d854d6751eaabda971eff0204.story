An Australian man has been threatened with an 'unusual way of death' by the Islamic terrorist group who kidnapped him just over a year ago.

Warren Rodwell, a 54-year-old retired soldier, was seized from his home in the Philippines in December 2011 by gunmen from the al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group Al Harakatul Al-Islamiyyah.

In a harrowing video message, Mr Rodwell admits he holds 'no hope at all' of ever being released and says he has lost trust in the Australian government.

A picture posted on facebook shows Mr Rodwell in a jungle camp in the southern Philippines surrounded by masked Islamic gunmen.

In an internet message aimed at the Australian government, the kidnappers say Mr Rodwell, will soon be executed unless the unspecified ransom is paid immediately.

Mr Rodwell was seized from his home in Mindanao in the south of the Philippines

The message reads: ‘If you have concerned (sic) with 
your men, we will give you a chance to save his life before it’s too 
late, as soon as possible time, otherwise he will suffer unusual way of 
Death.’

Islamic terrorist groups in the southern Philippines – there are three major organisations – have either shot or beheaded captives in the past and the reference to an ‘unusual way of death’ is believed to suggested a beheading.

Four other foreigners are being held for ransom in the Philippines, although the last hostage to be executed – a Peruvian American – was killed in 2001.

Other hostages have died in exchanges of gunfire between terrorists and government troops.

Mr Rodwell appears to have lost a considerable 
amount of weight since the day he was captured from the home he shared 
with his Filipina wife.  

In a video clip released last month a downcast Mr Rodwell said the group holding him had posted it ‘to say that I’m alive.

'I am waiting to be released…I personally hold no hope at all for being released.’

The group holding him say in their latest internet message that they operate ‘in the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate.’

They add: ‘All praise is for Allah, 
the Lord of the Universe. May Allah bestow peace and blessings upon our 
Leader Muhammad, Leader of those who strive in Allah’s way and Imam of 
the pious.’

The group also 
has a message to ‘our brothers in Islam It adds: ‘We would like to make 
it clear that our activities like this are not for personal interests or
 just to gain money for personal use.

‘Let
 it be known to everyone we are on war against the forces of shaytan 
(the Devil) in the Philippines, its allies and supporters, and whatever 
we gain from this war is to be used for our future operations and other 
necessities.’

Australia’s Foreign Minister told the
 Australian Broadcasting Corporation today that the government was 
continuing to work on getting Mr Rodwell released, along with help from 
the Philippines government.

The Labour government has a policy of not paying ransoms but it says that families of kidnap victims are made aware of the option of engaging a private kidnap and ransom consultant.

‘If a family chooses to engage a kidnap and ransom specialist, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to provide the family and their representatives with as much information as possible, bearing in mind national security and privacy concerns’ says the government.
