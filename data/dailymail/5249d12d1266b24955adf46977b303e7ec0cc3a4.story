Benson Henderson used his championship experience to dispatch Brandon Thatch by rear naked choke in the fourth round of their main event clash in Colorado on Saturday evening.

The former lightweight champion was making his debut as a welterweight and was made to work hard by Thatch before finishing strongly.

'Sometimes you gotta go out there give it your all and test yourself,' Henderson said.

'I didn’t know if I could win this fight. A lot of times you’ve got to do things that you don’t know. Our biggest fear is not that we are inadequate, our biggest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.

'I knew he was going to come out like a monster in the first round; he did. I didn’t want to run away, but that’s a big dude. I didn’t want to stand with him. I figured I’d be more elusive and then in the second, third, fourth, fifth round I’d pick it up on him.'

Thatch landed some dangerous shots throughout the first three rounds of the fight, but it was clear that Henderson was the more energetic of the two going into the fourth session, having disrupted Thatch's breathing by applying a body triangle in the third.

When Henderson changed levels midway through the fourth to land a well-timed takedown and establish control of Thatch’s back for the second time in the contest, the writing was on the wall.

As soon as the hometown hero opened up his neck, Henderson immediately applied his choking arm. Although Thatch initially did well to defend the choke, the former lightweight king adapted well to finish the bout and return to his winning ways after a disappointing recent spell in the UFC.

And Thatch was quick to praise Henderson on the victory.

'He’s just a tough dude,' he said. 'He’s got the heart of a champion. I thought he was hurt in the first and second when I caught him to the body.

'I think I threw power a little bit more than I should have. That’s just trial and error and I think I need a little more experience. He’s a class act.'

Despite hinting that this trip to 170lbs would be a one off, Henderson was quick to change his tune on the back of the big win.

With top 170 lbs prospect Rory MacDonald left without an opponent after Hector Lombard was ruled out of their April 25 meeting, Henderson revealed that he would happily take the former Bellator champion’s place.

'I hear there’s a big name, MacDonald up in Canada, that needs a fight,' he said. 'I’m game.'

In the co-main event, meanwhile, Max Holloway defeated veteran Cole Miller over three rounds.

It was later announced that the Hawaiian featherweight will now meet No 5 ranked Cub Swanson on April 18 in Newark, a bout which will undoubtedly have huge championship implications for Holloway.
