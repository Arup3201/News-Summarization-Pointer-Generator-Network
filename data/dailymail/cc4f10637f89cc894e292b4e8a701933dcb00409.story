Reverend Jesse Jackson has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Duck Dynasty, comparing Phil Robertson to the driver who had ordered Rosa Parks to sit in the back of the bus. 

The 67-year-old Robertson family patriarch and star of the mega-hit A&E reality show has unleashed a firestorm earlier this month after making anti-gay remarks in a interview with GQ.

Mr Robertson had been quoted in a January 2014 edition of the magazine as saying: 'It seems
 like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s
 anus.

Speaking out: Civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson released a statement condemning Phil Robertson for his recent homophobic remarks

Historic reference: Jackson said that Robertson was more offensive than the Montgomery, Alabama, bus driver who ordered Rosa Parks (pictured) to site in the back of the bus in 1959

'That’s just 
me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I 
mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not 
logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

In the wake of the scandal, A&E had suspended Robertson from the show and Cracker Barrel restaurants briefly pulled some of his merchandise from their country stores.

But less than 48 hours after that 
decision was made, the chain of restaurants was met with flurry of 
negative comments from customers and has since decided to restock 
Robertson's products.

For Reverend Jackson and his Rainbow PUSH Coalition, as well as for the LGBT organization GLAAD, these attempts at damage control have been insufficient. 

‘These statements uttered by Robertson are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago,’ Jackson said in a statement obtained by ABC News.

‘At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law.

‘Robertson’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law, within a context of what he seemed to believe was “white privilege.”’

In his statement, the 72-year-old civil rights leader demanded to meet within 72 hours with A&E executives and Cracker Barrel’s CEO to discuss the future of Duck Dynasty memorabilia.

Jackson also urged the network to uphold Robertson’s indefinite suspension from the popular program.

For the most part, sponsors have 
stuck behind Robertson. The shows biggest advertiser, Under Armor, stuck
 with the show after the scandal that started this week.

When Robertson's comments went public, A&E network said: 'We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s 
comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not 
reflected in the series Duck Dynasty.

'His
 personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have 
always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.

'The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely,' said the statement released to Entertainment Weekly.

However, a source at the network told EW Monday that Phil will be featured in new episodes when the fourth season debuts in mid-January, and that they would ideally like to keep him on for a fifth season.

According to the source, the network is hoping the situation will blow over during the holiday season.

The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers.

The 67-year-old came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine. He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.'

Robertson, who claims to be devoutly 
Christian, also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes 
when he referenced a Bible quote in the magazine interview.

He
 said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the 
male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, 
the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. 
Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.'

Since
 its initial air date of March 21, 2012, Duck Dynasty has grown in the 
ratings for A&E, eventually becoming a ratings hit for the cable 
network.

On August 14, 
2013, the fourth season première nabbed 11.8 million viewers, making the
 show the most-watched nonfiction series telecast in the history of 
cable television.

The fourth season of the show begins on January 15.
