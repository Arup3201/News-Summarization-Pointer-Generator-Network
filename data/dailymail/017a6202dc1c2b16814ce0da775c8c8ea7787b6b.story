A two-year-old British boy has been 'wrongfully retained' in Egypt for nearly a year by his father after getting 'caught up' in a parental dispute, a High Court judge said today.

Mr Justice Roderic Wood said Omar Antar has not seen his British mother - Aisha Qureshi, 35, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire - since late December.

The judge gave permission for the 'sad case' to be reported at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London - after an application by Ms Qureshi’s lawyers.

He said he hoped that publicity would pressurise Omar’s father - an Egyptian businessman Abdelaziz Antar, 39 - into obeying a High Court order to return the boy to the care of his 'beleaguered mother'.

Mr Justice Wood was told by lawyers representing Ms Qureshi that Omar had been living with his mother in England and Mr Antar had been living in Egypt.

Ms Qureshi and Omar had travelled to Egypt for a wedding in November 2012 - but Mr Antar had refused to let the little boy return.

Mr Justice Roderic Wood said the High Court had ordered Mr Antar to return Omar to England and to his mother’s care. An Egyptian court had also ordered Mr Antar to return the youngster to his mother.

'In yet another sad case a child is caught up in a dispute between his parents who are living in different countries,' said Mr Justice Roderic Wood.

'(Ms Qureshi) needs to obtain (Omar’s) return to this country, where he was born, and where he lived until his father wrongfully retained him in Egypt in December last year at the end of a visit by the mother and Omar for a family wedding.

'That retention was against the mother’s will. As I understand, she has not seen Omar since.'

The judge gave permission for the 'sad case' to be reported at a hearing in the Family Division

The judge added: “It is considered by the mother’s legal team that giving publicity to this case will motivate (Mr Antar’s) family and friends to put pressure on him to return Omar. I hope for the boy’s sake that they are right.'

The judge said Mr Antar had to obey orders made by English and Egyptian courts.

'The court will readily consider the father’s proposals for the future care of Omar once the boy is back here.'

Clare Renton, for Ms Qureshi, said police in Egypt had recently visited Mr Antar’s home but had not been able to persuade him to co-operate.

Lawyers for Ms Qureshi explained the background in a written 'case summary' released to the press.

They said Ms Qureshi and Mr Antar had met via the internet in 2008. Mr Antar was married with three children and living in Egypt.

He wished to 'enter into a second marriage' and had said he was planning to relocate to England.

He had said he owned a 'vehicle export/import' business and frequently travelled to England.

Lawyers said the couple had married in a Muslim wedding ceremony in June 2008 in Dewsbury. They said the marriage was not recognised under English law.

Mr Antar had stayed with Ms Qureshi for 'approximately two weeks' and returned to Egypt at the end of June. After that he had visited Ms Qureshi 'approximately every six months'.

Omar had been born in July 2011. Mr Antar had been in England for the birth before returning to Egypt at the end of July.

Lawyers said Ms Qureshi had visited Mr Antar in 2010 and 2011.

'The mother travelled to Egypt on a third occasion on November 18, 2012 on return tickets,' said the case summary.

'She was due to return to England with the child on December 18. Following to mother’s arrival in Egypt, the father removed the child’s passport from her handbag without her knowledge.

'She was, on December 28, 2012, escorted to Cairo airport and forced to book a return flight to England. The mother arrived home in England on December 30, 2012.'

The judge was told Omar had been living with his mother in England and Mr Antar had been living in Egypt

Lawyers said Ms Qureshi had asked Mr Antar to return Omar but he had refused.

She had then begun legal action in the High Court in England - and Egypt - and in February Mr Antar had been ordered to return Omar to England.

Lawyers said attempts to enforce that order had failed and Ms Qureshi had 'felt that she had no option but to seek the lifting of publicity restrictions' in the hope that media coverage would help bring about Omar’s return.

Previous High Court hearings had been held in private and journalists had not been allowed to identify Omar.
