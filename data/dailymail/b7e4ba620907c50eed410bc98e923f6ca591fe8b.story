A millionaire businessman extradited to the US for arms dealing is back at home with his family after being released.

Christopher Tappin, 67, from Orpington, south London, has been released from a London prison after he was transferred from the US in September last year.

In November 2012 he pleaded guilty to selling batteries used in Hawk Air Defence Missiles to Iran and was given a 33-month sentence and ordered to pay a fine of $11,357 (£6,693).

Tappin was accused of using his company to ship five batteries used in missiles to Iran via the Netherlands. He was extradited to the US in February 2012 (pictured) and jailed in January 2013

Before that Tappin spent 20 months fighting extradition, which cost him £500,000 in lawyers' fees, according to an interview in The Times.

Daughter Georgina Raeburn confirmed her father is home but was not ready to talk about the situation in detail.

While in the US Mr Tappin was in a Pennsylvanian prison and before being flown back to England was incarcerated in a New York detention centre which was 'teeming with rats', according to his lawyer.

He described a harrowing ordeal involving being confined to a windowless room in solitary confinement.

A former director of an international freight service and president of Kent Golf Society, the family man maintains his innocence, saying he was trapped in a sting by FBI agents.

Mr Tappin believes evidence may have been doctored and he had no choice but to enter a plea bargain with US prosecutors or face spending the rest of his life in jail.

Between December 2005 and January 2007 it is believed he knowingly aided and abetted others in an illegal attempt to export certain batteries which are special components of the Hawk Air Defence Missile.

Now home with his wife, Elaine, he is hoping to fight the 2003 extradition legislation that meant UK courts had no power to prevent him being sent to US shores.

It was brought in to help the countries move terrorist suspects more easily but is now often used for those charged with crimes unrelated to terrorism.

Mr Tappin handed himself into US Marshalls at Heathrow in September 2012 and since then had been unable to return home to visit his family.

Tappin maintains his innocence, saying evidence against him was doctored and that he only pleaded guilty to avoid spending the rest of his life in jail
