Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won re-election to a sixth term, on Tuesday, fending off a challenge from Kentucky Secretary of State Grimes and boosting Republican hopes of taking control of the upper chamber.

The win sets McConnell, 72, up as the likely majority leader of that body if Republicans pick off Democrats in a handful of other combative races tonight.

In a victory speech McConnell said his reelection was proof positive that 'we can do better as a nation.'

Tonight Kentuckians 'said we can have real change in Washington. Real change. And that's what I intend to deliver,' McConnell told a room full of cheering fans.

Tough loss: Grimes ended up losing to McConnell by 15 points in what was expected to be a fairly close race

McConnell, who was first elected in 1984, defeated Grimes, a 35-year-old Democrat.

Once a promising pick-up opportunity for Democrats, Grimes' numbers tanked after she refused to say during the campaign whether she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.

McConnell has battled low approval ratings at home, but he successfully hammered away at Grimes, and her approval rating, over her lack of transparency and support for Obama.

In their only debate, in mid-October, McConnell sought to wrap Grimes in Obama's weak approval ratings, while Grimes said McConnell represented Washington more than Kentucky after 30 years in office.

McConnell said he would work to repeal Obamacare, the president's signature piece of legislation. It will most certainly be a main target for Republicans if the party wrestles control of the Senate from Democrats. 

National Democrats pulled ad buys from the state in a blow to Grimes after she serially declined to state her support for Obama but brought them back in the closing weeks as polls showed the race still tight.

In the end McConnell pulled off a double-digit victory over Grimes, 56-41, when 91 percent of the votes had been tallied. 

In her speech Grimes acknowledged that 'tonight didn't bring us the result we had hoped to.' But 'this journey, the fight for you, it was worth it,' she told her supporters

At a much more somber party across town, Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear said he 'couldn't be prouder' of Grimes than he was tonight 'because she took every blow there was to take from millions and millions of dollars, and she's still standing straight up.'

In a speech of her own Grimes acknowledged that 'tonight didn't bring us the result we had hoped to.' But 'this journey, the fight for you, it was worth it,' she told her supporters.

'My hope is the message has been sent to Congress' that it needs to increase the minimum wage, close the gender pay gap, and bring 'good paying' jobs to Kentucky, she added.

'This journey, this fight was for each and every one of you, and I will work my hardest to keep this amazing organization that we have built together intact to fight for a brighter and better future,' she promised.

Serving as the opening act for McConnell was fellow Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who was not up for reelection this year.

Paul told attendees of McConnell's event that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had 'trampled on their liberties.'

'That ends tonight,' he said to cheers.

'Instead of maligning American business, we will cultivate american business and cultivate America's job making machine,' he told them,

'We say to Hillary Clinton, yes businesses do create jobs,' the likely presidential candidate said, taking a jab at possible challenger Clinton.

McConnell's wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, lauded her her husband as he came on stage.

'In times like these, we've never needed a leader more like Mitch McConnell,' she said. 'Mitch is committed to restoring Americans' faith government. He's passionate about expanding opportunities for all Kentuckians. And he will never back down from defending what is right.

'He is incredibly dedicated to the people of this commonwealth, he has never forgotten his roots.' That's 'one of the reasons' Chao said she has always 'admired' her husband.

Taking an opportunity to show her lighter side, Chao said there's another reason she's glad that her husband won his race tonight.

'Mitch couldn't be more grateful for your support, and I couldn't be more grateful that Mitch will have something to do that will keep him busy for the next six years,' she said to laughter. 'I mean I love the man, but I don't want him for lunch every day.'

Joining his wife on stage McConnell said 'tonight turns a corner' in Kentucky, 'and the future I see tonight is a bright one.'

'It's time to go in a new direction. It's time to turn this country around. And I will not let you down,' he declared.
