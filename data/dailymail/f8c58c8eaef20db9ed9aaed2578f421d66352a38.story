The Lib Dems could creep back into government even if they lose half of their MPs, senior figures close to Nick Clegg have claimed.

Publicly the party has boasted that it will fare better than disastrous polling ratings suggest, but privately the leadership fears it could be reduced to just 30 MPs, compared to the 57 it won in 2010.

But insiders suggest this could be enough to put them back in power, most probably with the Conservatives.

Mr Clegg will use his speech to his party conference in Liverpool today to insist the Lib Dems 'are here to stay'.

In some recent polls the party has been as low as just 5 per cent, with predictions of big losses against Labour in the north of England and the SNP in Scotland.

But Mr Clegg will insist: 'I've heard the predictions. I've seen the polls. But let me tell you this: we will do so much better than anyone thinks. 

'In those seats where we are out in force, making our case loudly and proudly, we are the ones making the political weather.'

But privately the mood is less upbeat. Senior Lib Dems admit the election will be 'really tough' and as many as half of their MPs will be ousted.

In a bizarre twist they claim this could still be enough to put the party back in government, and keep Mr Clegg as Deputy PM.

It is suggested that if the Tories fall between 10 and 30 seats short of a majority, a deal could be done.

However, a power-sharing agreement with Labour looks less and less likely.

A source said: 'Reaching 325 is the key. If the Tories have 295 then we would be the ones to get them to that number. 

'Around 30 would be enough. I can't see any way in which Labour forms the largest party. Everything is in favour of the Tories.

'It is going to be really tough. To get 40 seats would be amazing but 30 could still put us back in government.'

Taking questions from activists at the conference yesterday, Mr Clegg was challenged over why the party's polls ratings were so bad and how they could be improved.

He joked that he was open to suggestions, adding 'answers on a postcard please'.

The Lib Dems have never recovered from breaking their flagship promise to scrap tuition fees which has dogged Mr Clegg throughout the five years of the coalition.

Those close to the leader say he has been punished by the Tories for compromising for the coalition, but the larger party has not been hit in the same way.

'We have never properly punished the Tories for something, we have never made them eat crow,' said a source.

It is thought many in the party now wish they had halted and then scrapped the controversial health reforms which were paused but later passed by the two parties.
