A West Australian man has infuriated local police after he allegedly taxied a plane down to his local pub. 

Officers from the small town of Newman, in West Australia's Pilbara region, were called to the Newman Hotel Purple Pub at 2pm on Friday where the small yellow plane had been parked outside.

The small two-seater aircraft, which had no wings, was seen driving down to the pub with its propeller running, according to witnesses.

A small two-seater plane, with no wings, was found parked outside a local pub in West Australia's Newman by police officers on Friday 

'The driver had gone into the pub and police conducted an interview, but he wasn't very forthcoming about telling us what was going on,' Sergeant Mark Mckenzie told Daily Mail Australia.

'People could say it was funny but one gust of wind or a circumstance where kids run out onto the road and it would have been very dangerous. 

'There was a busy service station outside the pub, the pub itself and kids leaving school at the time. 

'The plane doesn't have a steering wheel, it's directed by foot pedals and it didn't have any wings, but the propeller was going. That's how he was propelling his way through and that's where the danger would come from if anyone ran into it.'

A bar tender at the Newman Hotel (pictured) said  customers cheered the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'

A bar tender at the Newman Hotel told Daily Mail Australia that the 37-year-old driver of the plane entertained pub patrons by 'playing dumb' when being questioned by police.

She said the customers were cheering the man on through his interview with police and had dubbed him a 'legend'.

Despite the local man's popularity, officers are hoping to charge the man for his reckless behaviour.

'He hasn't been charged yet but we are trying to work out what the appropriate offence is because it's something bizarre,' Sergeant Mckenzie said.

Not all of the local officers have failed to see the humours side of the incident, with Esperance police launching a  Twitter competition

'What he did was dangerous and could have endangered people.' 

However local officers have not entirely failed to see the humours side of the incident.

Esperance police have launched a competition over Twitter asking social media users to come up with the best caption for a photograph of the plane parked outside the Newman Hotel.

'Best caption wins a Mars Bar and tour of Esperance police station. Thanks #Newman police for the chuckles,' the station Tweeted on Saturday.
