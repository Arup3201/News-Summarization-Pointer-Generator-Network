They were never likely to have a whirlwind romance, but these two appear to be taking their relationship at snail's pace.

The molluscs were captured kissing while perched precariously on top of cherry stems in woodland near Berdichev in Ukraine. 

They could be seen leaning towards each other in a desperate bid to kiss - before finally locking lips.

The amazing moment was caught on camera by photographer, Vyacheslav Mischenko, near his hometown in the Zhytomyr Oblast region.

Footage shows the snails balancing carefully atop the cherry stems, which are floating in a stream.

They then slowly stretch towards each other - while trying to stay upright - before eventually locking lips.

Mr Mischenko, 48, described the moment as as 'sweet' - adding: 'The pair seemed really intent on reaching one another.'

The photographer, who was taught to hunt for mushrooms as a child, has grown up with a keen eye for spotting wildlife.

'As a child, my father taught me to hunt mushrooms near my home and we would always come across all manner of bugs and creatures,' he said.

'As I got older and my interest in photography grew, I decided I wanted to catch these magical scenes on camera.

Taking things slowly: Mr Mischenko, 48, said the pair of snails 'seemed really intent on reaching one another'

'I'm an old romantic at heart and as soon I saw these two cute snails, I knew it would make a great picture.'

He added: 'The average person misses so much, it's only when you look a little closer that you'll find many moments such as this one.'
