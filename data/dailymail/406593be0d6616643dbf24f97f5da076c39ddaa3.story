A motorist has branded council jobsworths 'pathetic' after he was given a parking ticket for briefly pulling over to check a road's parking restrictions.

David Osborne, 68, stopped outside a bar he was visiting in Bristol and got out of the driver's seat to read a parking sign on the pavement.

When he realised it was a clearway for another 90 minutes he jumped back into his car and parked around the corner.

David Osborne was sent this parking fine picture by Bristol City Council showing him looking at a sign about parking restrictions

But his momentary infringement was caught on film by a CCTV operator at Bristol City Council and he was sent a £70 penalty notice.

Mr Osborne, from the city, said: 'I’ll be honest, when I first opened the letter I had to really think back as I couldn’t even remember the incident. I was very shocked.

'I couldn’t have been parked up for more than 90 seconds, tops.

'I literally got out of the car, looked up at the sign and saw I couldn’t park there during peak hours, so I got back in and drove away.'

The letter included pictures of Mr Osborne, snapped by the council’s cameras, which clearly showed him out of his car, leaning back to check the signs.

'It’s pathetic, and a complete waste of the council’s money,' he added.

Mr Osborne pulled up for a minute to check the hours of parking restrictions - only to receive a £70 fine in the post almost four weeks later

The parking restrictions sign in Bristol Osborne fell foul of

'It has to pay to send the notice and pictures out and then for the appeal process, all for the sake of a few seconds. It’s ridiculous.'

Mr Osborne had taken his partner out for a romantic Valentine’s Day drink at a pub in Fishponds, Bristol, when he thought he had found the perfect spot to park outside.

But after hopping out at 5.01pm to check the parking sign he saw there was a restriction between 4.30pm and 6.30pm, so he drove off to park his Land Rover Defender nearby.

He thought nothing more of it until the parking fine dropped on his doormat demanding he paid the full amount within 28 days.

Mr Osborne, who works as a builder and decorator, said: 'I now have to spend my time sorting this all out. Why should anyone have to go through that?'

He added: 'I understand parking tickets are necessary and if I’d parked without paying then I wouldn’t have a problem.

'But how do the council expect you to know you can’t park there if the signs aren’t clearly visible from inside the car?'

Bristol City Council has now said it has re-considered the case and would be withdrawing the fine.

A council spokeswoman said: 'The case has been reviewed and we will be withdrawing the penalty charge notice issued to Mr Osborne.

'He was clearly reading the restriction signs and not parking. We would like to remind drivers who think they have received a parking fine incorrectly to use the appeals procedure that is set out on the ticket.'
