They were once the proud centrepiece of a family's Christmas decoration decked in fairy lights and baubles.

But now, with the festive season well and truly over, these trees were left discarded in the street along with the other rubbish ready to be taken away by the bin men.

Over the past few days, homes up and down the country have taken down their festive decorations after welcoming in 2015.

And in Twickenham, London people left their now forlorn looking trees outside their houses, ready for them to be taken away with the rubbish.

The scene was mirrored up and down the country as people returned to work and school following the Christmas break. 

According to the tradition, Christmas decorations should come down on the Twelfth Night which officially falls on January 5.

Up and down the country, people were throwing away their old Christmas trees after the festive season came to an end

Most people were throwing out their trees following the Twelfth Night earlier this week, which officially marks the end of Christmas 

There is a widely-held belief that it is bad luck to leave Christmas decorations, including the tree, up past Twelfth Night – an idea previously attached to the festival of Candlemass in early February.

There is also some debate over when exactly Twelfth Night falls, with some arguing it is the evening before the Twelfth Day, also known as the Epiphany.

Others say it falls the following evening, as Twelfth Day itself draws to a close.

However, earlier this week, one Cambridgeshire zoo came up with a novel idea for people wanting to get rid of their old Christmas trees.

Linton zoo were urging people to donated their unwanted fir trees as toys for their lions.

According to the zoo, the lions love playing with the trees, with them being described as like 'catnip' to the big cats.
