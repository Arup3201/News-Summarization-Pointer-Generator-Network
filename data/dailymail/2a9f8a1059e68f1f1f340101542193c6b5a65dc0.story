One of the richest towns in Britain also has the highest number of people having extramarital affairs, according to new research.

Wealthy Maidenhead tops a new UK Infidelity Index listing the towns where the highest percentage of the population are cheating on their partners.

The Berkshire borough has 1,316 people having or actively seeking affairs using dating website Illicit Encounters out of a population of 63,580, meaning that at least two per cent of the town is cheating.

In second place is Livingston in West Lothian, Scotland, with 1,080 cheats (1.91 per cent of the population) and Farnborough in Surrey comes third.

The most faithful town according to the site is
 Bournemouth in Dorset, probably due to high numbers of elderly residents
 who are more settled in their relationships.

Many of the towns with the highest numbers of cheats are wealthy areas in the south of England.

Maidenhead has more millionaires than any other town in England outside of London.

With an average house price of more than £450,00 and an idyllic riverside location, it is one of the most desirable places to live in the UK.

Dating site Illicit Encounters has over 880,000 registered users and the site has seen a 40 per cent surge in registrations in the last five years which it puts down to couples not being able to divorce due economic pressures and rising house prices.

Brazen Louise Van der Velde, 40, is a member of Illicit Encounters and regularly sees wealthy men on the site for dates and sex.

Louise, the widow of a doctor, does this with the full knowledge and agreement of her boyfriend, Mark Howard, 39, a fitness instructor.

Mother-of-two Louise said: ‘I enjoy being in a relationship but I also crave the excitement of meeting new people.

‘I have been on Illicit Encounters for around six months and during that time I have had affairs with five men.

‘They have mostly been rich 
businessmen in the commuter belt around Surrey who are bored in their 
marriages and are seeking sex, fun and a change in their daily routine. 
They are fed up with sitting in silence in front of the TV with their 
wives every night.

‘They
 have no intention of leaving their wives and simply want to enjoy some 
uncomplicated fun with a woman they know isn’t going to make any 
unexpected demands.

‘The men and women who use the site have exactly the same motives – they want sex and change to their daily routine but don’t want to upset things at home.’

Affairs are on the rise as many couples simply cannot afford to divorce due economic pressures and ever-increasing house prices

One of her lovers is a 48-year-old banker who has been on the site for five years and is married with two teenage children.

Louise said: ‘He adores his wife but there is no sexual spark anymore and they have not made love for the last few years. Neither wants to divorce and they are loving parents to their children so he sees women very discreetly for sex without his wife’s knowledge.'

Louise lives with Mark in Camberley, Surrey, where 616 people are having affairs through the site, according to the Infidelity Index.

She said: ‘If you are looking to have an extramarital affair, the Surrey commuter belt is perfect.

‘There are plenty of middle class people in the Acacia Avenues around here craving some added excitement in their lives.'

Mark said: ‘I am fully aware of Louise’s lifestyle and don’t see anything wrong with it. We are completely honest with each other.

‘The days when couples were happy to stay faithful to the same partner for 50 years or longer are over for many people.’

Amazingly Louise is a Harley Street-based relationship expert. She specialises in counselling couples on how they can enjoy life with more than one partner.

She added: ‘Monogamy is out. I’m living a new model of relationship and it really works.’

A spokesman for Illicit Encounters said: 'Spiralling house prices have made divorce increasingly difficult for many couples. They are struggling along unhappily because they simply cannot afford to set up two homes.

‘We are increasingly popular in rich commuter towns like Maidenhead which has some of the most expensive homes in the country.'
