With dishes including brown rice salad,  chipotle pulled pork and balsamic strawberry soda you may expect to be sitting in a hipster cafe in the inner-city.

But this trendy lunch spot in  Sydney's Camperdown is actually a McDonald's, the first McCafe in the world to re-brand as 'The Corner'.

The global fast food giant - best known for Big Macs, cheeseburgers and Happy Meals - is using the restaurant as a testing ground to trial different gourmet menu items as it undergoes a $1 billion remodelling.

McDonald's has re-branded its McCafe in Camperdown, Sydney to be called 'The Corner'

McDonald's says it is a 'learning lab' where the fast food giant will test out never before seen menu items

The Corner is a world first for McDonald's, and could pave the way for a drastic rebranding of McCafe stores

Menu items include salads featuring Moroccan chicken breast, chipotle pulled pork, brown rice and lentils

The cafe has a menu board that changes daily, but is built around a base of salads and brown rice.

These can be customised with ingredients like Morroccan roast chicken breast and a range of sauces including chutneys and chimichurri.

Field service manager Cameron Newlands said the café also serves smoothies and craft sodas, along with the more traditional McCafe menu items such as coffees, desserts and pastries.

'We also do the breakfast bacon egg roll, avocado and feta on sourdough, we are trying to be a lot more in line with the café trend,' he said. 

The new McCafe is just 600 metres away from King St, Newtown, where McDonald's famously shut its doors in 1998 because locals wanted more organic and natural food. 

The cafe also serves up coffee made by baristas, as well as cakes and pastries

The re-branded McCafe comes after McDonald's announced a new gourmet menu in October, which it hopes will take the fast food chain upmarket.

Customers will be able to build their own burger from scratch from a range of ingredients, while some restaurants will offer table service. 

To hold it all together, the burgers will even come with toothpicks holding them together, just like they do in more trendy eateries.

This new menu will be rolled out to McDonald's customers in Australia over the next six months after the fancy new range was launched in Sydney.

The Create Your Taste gourmet burgers  will be rolled out in all restaurants over the next six to nine months

Customers will also treated to table service, allowing them to sit down and enjoy a drink while they wait for their creation to be made and brought to their table

McDonald's Australia boss Andrew Gregory told Daily Mail Australia that customers have driven the overhaul.

The company is in the throes of a $1billion remodelling, which will introduce more of its Australian fast-food restaurants over the next five years.

The 'create your own gourmet burger' offers 19 different fillings served on wooden platters with a side of fries in a basket, complete with table service.

Customers can order their customised burgers on a digital touch-screen menu which also offers up never seen before choices at McDonald's such as guacamole, tortilla chips and a range of other sauces.

Mr Gregory revealed there are plans for three more so-called 'Customer Learning Labs' will open this year, with a further ten planned in early 2015 before a full roll out.

The first at McDonald's to trial the revamped menu and service will be Castle Hill in Sydney's north-west.

'We will build another three of these before the end of the year and test and learn and listen to our customers,' he said.

'We plan to do it over the next 12 months in every restaurant around Australia.'

Aside from the gourmet burgers, digital self-service kiosks and menu boards, McDonald's will also include home delivery as part of the service. 

'McDonald's is innovating and changing again to meet the needs of our customers,' Mr Gregory said.

The 'create your own burgers' range will be offered across Australia in the next six to nine months

'All of our innovations have been led by Australians. What we're really doing here is just what our customers have asked us to do.

'An important part of our new learning lab restaurants is that we take customers along the journey with us and get their feedback - we want to make sure Maccas restaurants of the future are what Aussies ordered.'

Mr Gregory said there will also be a change in the working culture and how staff interact with customers.

Australia's love of McDonald's began when the first fast-food restaurant opened in Yagoona is Sydney's south-west in 1971.

There are about 930 McDonald's restaurants across Australia which serves more than 1.7 million customers a day and employ up to 90,000 people. 

There will also be table service for customers and home deliveries for 'create your own burgers' customers
