We may not yet have the hoverboard promised in 2015 by the Back To The Future franchise, but this device looks like the next best thing. 

The IO Hawk is a cross between a Segway, without the handle, and a skateboard.

It costs $1,799 (£1,185) and has a maximum speed limit of 6.2mph (10km/h) - although the release date hasn’t been announced.

The IO Hawk (pictured) is a cross between a Segway, without the handle, and a skateboard. The futuristic board weighs 22lbs (10kg) and is controlled by leaning and tilting the body thanks to sensitive sensors built into each foot panel. It costs $1,799 (£1,185) and has a maximum speed limit of 6.2mph (10km/h)

By comparison, a Segway costs in the region of £5,000 ($7,500), while a similar product called the AirWheel - that has steps on either side of a larger wheel – costs £500 ($750).

Colours: Red, black and white

Weight: 22lbs (10kg)

Load: Up to 220lbs (110kg)

Range: Nine and 12 miles (14km and 19km)

Price: $1,799 (£1,185)

Release date: To be announced 

There are three colours - red, black and white - but the other specifications and prices are the same for each model.

Each IO Hawk can take up to 220lbs (110 kg) in weight, and sits approximately six inches (15cm) off the ground.

The tyres measure 6.7 inches (17cm) and the whole device is dust and water resistant.

Its makers say each IO Hawk can travel between nine and 12 miles (14km and 19km) on a single charge, but this depends on the terrain.

The IO Hawk was created by California-based John Soibatian, who said the device takes just five minutes to learn how to ride.

‘Our lives are changing every day, we are always looking for ways to become more productive and efficient,’ said Mr Soibatian.

‘The IO HAWK is the next evolution in the way that we move.

‘These Personal Motorised Transporters are going to change the way you see, move, and connect with your world.’

Mr Soibatian has been showcasing the transporter at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

The IO Hawk device makes riders appear to glide and hover, and the design is similar to the hoverboard (pictured) used by Marty McFly in the Back To the Future II
