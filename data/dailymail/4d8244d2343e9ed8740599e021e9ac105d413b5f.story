A hopeless romantic is suing a dating site after a man he met online conned him out of $70,000.

Michael Picciano, 65, from Little Neck, an upper middle-class neighbourhood of Queens, New York, where a one-bedroom flat can cost up to $200,000, signed up to OkCupid in the hope of meeting Mr Right.

Picciano says in his Manhattan lawsuit that OkCupid and its parent company, IAC, did not carry out ‘even minimal screening of its subscribers and therefore deceptively creating the impression that their dating service was safe. . . when in fact . . . [it] was a trap for the unwary’.

OkCupid bills itself as 'the best free dating site on Earth' and so Michael Picciano was not wary when he received a message from 'genuineguy62'

The New Yorker was excited when on February 11, 2013 he received a message from ‘genuineguy62’.

Picciano said that he ‘felt safe’ and ‘trusted’ his online match, supposedly a man named Bruce Thompson, simply because ‘Thompson’ had a profile on OkCupid, which bills itself as ‘the best free dating site on Earth’, reports the New York Post.

The following month, Picciano and ‘Thompson’ were in contact via phone, Skype and email.

‘Thompson’ said that since ‘they had found each other’ there was no need for them to continue on the site and they should delete their accounts – Picciano agreed.

Picciano was ‘comfortable’ enough with his new love to send him $24,000 ‘for unexpected fees he incurred in his dealings setting up a new computer-parts business’.

He was not suspicious when ‘Thompson’ asked for the money to be sent to ‘Dennis E. Racer’ in Addison, Texas, and ‘Edmond Thebeau’ in Canada.

In April, when asked by ‘Thompson’, Picciano sent a further $46,420 to ‘MacBenson and Associates’ in Britain through his Capital One bank account.

That month, the penny finally dropped and after a friend helped Picciano track 'Thompson' down on a site called malesscammers.com, he went to the police.at the 111th Precinct in Queens.

‘It was apparent that Mr Thompson had used the same Cleveland, Ohio-based phone number and the same email address. . . with Mr Picciano that he had used to perpetrate other frauds,’ the lawsuit says.

The police told to stay in touch with ‘Thompson’ who then sent him a forged cheque and a loan note but no fingerprints could be found and the authorities could not 
trace the software used to create the phony cheque.

Picciano is also suing his bank, Capital One, for failing 'to comply with proper procedures for the transmission of wire funds'.

Picciano claims that ‘Thompson’ is still conning people on the site, using the name ‘bigheartedbt’.

Both Picciano and OkCupid refused to comment.
