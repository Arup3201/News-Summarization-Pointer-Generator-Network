He has brought North Korea to heel with what are described as brutal human rights abuses - but that wouldn't ever stop Kim Jong-Un posing with women's shoes.

The autocratic leader was pictured comparing high heels in a visit to a footwear factory in Wonsan, on the east coast 120 miles from the capital Pyongyang.

Kim examined ladies' formalwear surrounded by earnest-looking henchmen in matching grey suits holding notepads.

The 31-year-old North Korean leader, who assumed the title of Supreme Leader after his father's death in 2011, is regularly pictured in photo calls by state media.

The photos at the Wonsan Shoe Factory were released by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency and their origin cannot be verified.

Observers say the breezy propaganda which emanates from the secretive state belies a country in which secret arrests and executions are commonplace.
