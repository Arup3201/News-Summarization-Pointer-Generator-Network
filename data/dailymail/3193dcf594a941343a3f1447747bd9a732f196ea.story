William Shakespeare was probably depressed when he wrote King Lear and decided to change its ending at the last minute to kill off all the major characters, experts have said.

Simon Russell Beale, who played the main character in Sam Mendes' recent production at the National Theatre, said it is so 'savage' the Bard must have been going through a 'bad patch'.

Shakespeare's celebrated tragedy, written between 1605 and 1606, ends with Lear collapsing and dying on top of his daughter Cordelia, after she is hanged.

Was Shakespeare depressed? Simon Russell Beale, who played King Lear in Sam Mendes recent production at the National Theatre, left, says the Bard, right, must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'

Throughout the play Lear's empire and his own health declines as he suffers disaster after disaster while deceitful, conniving and murderous characters help destroy his life.

Mr Beale, who has considered Shakespeare's state of mind for the BBC Four documentary The Secret Life of Books, says the playwright must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'. 

He wrote Lear at the same time as Timon of Athens, and describes them both as 'savage'. 

He said: 'It must have been very depressing to write. It's as if Shakespeare can't stop this flow of invective and bile.

'So perhaps, I'm suggesting, he himself was depressed. He temporarily lost faith in human nature.' 

Betrayal: Lear wants to split his kingdom between his three daughters, but while Goneril and Regan (pictured with Lear) agree buy declaring their love for their father, the child who truly loves him, Cordelia, is banished and is eventually killed as the King goes mad

King Lear starts with the ageing Monarch announcing he will give his three daughters a third of his kingdom each, provided they declare their love for him.

His manipulative children Goneril and Regan agree but Cordelia, the only child who truly loves him, says she can't because she loves him more than her tongue can ever say.

Lear flies into a fury and banishes her and later, as he descends into madness and fails to reconcile with Cordelia before she is killed. 

According to research King Lear's first version was different but changed to 'obliterate a happy ending entirely'. 

'I wonder if he was going through a bad patch. I know it's a dangerous game to play, but I can't believe you do something so violent to your source material as that without a personal investment of some kind,' he said.

Sam Mendes, who directed King Lear at the National and also films like James Bond's latest film Skyfall said the 'truly dark play' is filled with 'shocking violence'.   

The Secret Life of Books starts on BBC Four on Tuesday September 2 at 8.30pm.
