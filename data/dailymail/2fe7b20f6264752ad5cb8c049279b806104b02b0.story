Labour was plunged into civil war over its mansion tax last night amid Scottish MPs’ plans to use millions of pounds raided from England to pay for 1,000 extra nurses north of the border.

MPs queued up to attack the party’s new Scottish leader, Jim Murphy, after he boasted that he would boost the NHS in Scotland by using up to £250million raised from the controversial tax in England.

Just 0.3 per cent of the £1.2billion raised by the tax – around £3.6million – will come from Scotland, but it will receive a huge share of the revenues.

Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy said 95% of mansion tax will be levied in the South East but that its 'benefit will be felt across the UK' 

Mr Murphy said this enabled him to make a ‘uniquely Labour pledge’ to increase spending on the Scottish NHS without having to increase taxes on Scots.

Former Labour leadership candidate Diane Abbott accused Mr Murphy of trying to ‘buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London’.

And former Labour Cabinet minister Tessa Jowell warned him against treating the South East as a ‘cash cow’.

In an angry on-air clash with Mr Murphy, Miss Abbott accused him of acting in a ‘highly unscrupulous way’.

Dianne Abbott slammed Mr Murphy’s proposal. She said: ‘He just thinks he can buy Scottish votes with money expropriated from London'

Mr Murphy mocked Miss Abbott after she mistakenly referred to him as John, saying: ‘It’s hard to take this argument seriously when she didn’t even remember my name.’ 

He said the levy will go towards funding an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland - even though just 0.3% will be raised north of the border (file picture)

He also told BBC Radio Four’s World At One programme that he doesn’t ‘have to clear things with Ed Miliband’, adding: ‘That’s not the way it works in the Labour Party these days.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Murphy of ‘mugging’ families in the South East to win votes in Scotland. 

The row erupted after Mr Murphy launched Labour’s election campaign in Scotland with a pledge to use the proceeds of the mansion tax to recruit an extra 1,000 nurses.

Labour’s new mansion tax will levy an annual charge on all properties valued at more than £2million. 

Full details have yet to be announced, but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said last year that homes worth between £2million and £3million will face an annual bill of £3,000, regardless of income. 

Critics warn that the tax will disproportionately hit London and the South East, where many ordinary family homes will be caught by the plans.

Fewer than 900 homes in Scotland would be affected – 0.3 per cent of the UK total.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said the row had plunged Labour into ‘chaos’. 

He said: ‘Jim Murphy’s comments show once again that Ed Miliband simply does not command the respect of his party. They don’t listen to him or consult him because he is a weak leader.’
