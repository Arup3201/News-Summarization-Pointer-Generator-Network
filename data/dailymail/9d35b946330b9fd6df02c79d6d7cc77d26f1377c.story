Pippa Middleton arrived for Prince George of Cambridge's christening yesterday in a couture coat that colour coordinated with Kate's outfit - as well as her nephew's christening gown.

The Middleton sisters both chose to wear cream for the historic occasion, with Pippa opting for a 'trapeze' coat and 'Paris' dress by British designer, Suzannah Crabb.

That Pippa, 30, matched her sister and nephew's gown was no coincidence. Suzannah revealed that the socialite had worked with her over the last few months to create the perfect outfit.

The designer said she undertook 'hours of research into the history of royal christenings' to create something truly fitting of the occasion.

She
 said: 'We aimed for understated beauty, drawing inspiration from a 
1960s coat dress that I bought in LA, among other vintage looks and 
archive pieces.

'The outfit had to be both
beautiful and appropriate from the length of the hem, to the style of the millinery and the subtle colour and cut.

'Lace has
been a popular fabric choice by significant guests at royal christenings since
1926 and a dress in a style similar was worn by Princess Victoria of Sweden to
the christening of her daughter Princess Estelle in 2012.'

The
 designer worked with Pippa to create a bespoke version of the cream 
coat, made from Italian wool with a blush pink trim and oyster silk 
lining. But a similar version is on sale for £750.

Suzannah also designed a cream version 
of her lace 'Paris' dress for Pippa to wear yesterday. A similar navy style 
costs £950 from her website.

For an event the royals had been at pains to describe as ‘intimate’, low key and private, it was all rather, well … public.

Within ten minutes of Pippa Middleton’s arrival at her nephew’s christening, the designers who made her outfit issued press releases about where the items could be purchased.

British designer Suzannah spoke of the ‘hours of research’ that had gone into Miss Middleton’s outfit.

Not far behind was a triumphant announcement from designer Catherine Walker that the Duchess’s mother, Carole, was sporting one of her coat dresses.

Spokesmen for both companies declined to say yesterday whether the women received a discount – directly or indirectly – in return for generating publicity for their brands.

A spokesman for Catherine Walker said: ‘This is not something that is ever commented on or discussed.’

The designer describes the dress as 'a modern shift, with a suitably high neckline and simple, clean lines, 
finished in French lace.' 

Pippa teamed her outfit with a jaunty hat by British milliner Edwina Ibbotson, shoes by Emmy and carried a peach clutch bag - all put together with Suzannah's expert eye for style.

Suzannah is a favourite designer of Pippa as she has worn her dresses on numerous occasions including society weddings.

The designer said it was a 'dream come true' when Pippa approached her about her outfit for the christening.

Pippa was saw the outfit take shape over several bespoke fittings and Suzannah said she was a joy to work with.

She said: 'Creating a couture dress and frock coat not only for the occasion of the royal christening, but for Pippa Middleton, who is so naturally elegant and stylish is a commission that every designer dreams of. It's so exciting that British fashion has such a champion.'

As well as Pippa, Suzannah has designed for Princesses 
Beatrice and Eugenie and pop stars Paloma Faith and Marina and The 
Diamonds.

As Pippa arrived for the service yesterday, she stopped to chat and shake hands with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who will baptised the three-month-old prince.

She smiled broadly for the cameras as she arrived at St James's Palace with her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and brother, James.

The magazine columnist, whose brunette hair was swept off her face in a half-up style, was not joined by her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson, 35.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were keen for yesterday's service to be an intimate, family affair  - despite the worldwide interest - and only 24 guests were invited.

Pippa is not one of the prince's godparents but will take a prominent role in his upbringing as his only aunty.

Along with Prince Harry, she was given a key role during the service as the Duke and Duchess asked their brother and sister to give readings at the christening.

Pippa read the first lesson, from the Gospel of St Luke, Chapter 18, verses 15-17.

Pippa gained notoriety as maid of honour at the royal wedding after causing a stir in her figure-hugging bridesmaid's dress that saw her dubbed 'her royal hotness'.

'It's startling to achieve recognition on account of your sister, brother-in-law and bottom,' she admitted in her party book Celebrate.

James Middleton risked comparison with his nephew’s namesake, King George V, by showing off a bushy beard at the christening yesterday.

But not everyone was convinced that the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother mastered the beard as well as the Queen’s grandfather.

On Twitter, it was described as ‘vast’ and ‘prolific’, while one user wrote: ‘James Middleton. What is that beard?!’.

Another user wrote: ‘You’d think James Middleton would have shaved his beard, not look like he’s just spent three months at sea.’

The 26-year-old was seen with a full beard last month while out with girlfriend Donna Air.

Observers suggested Mr Middleton, who owns a cake-making business, could be trying a more mature look for television presenter Miss Air, who is eight years his senior.
