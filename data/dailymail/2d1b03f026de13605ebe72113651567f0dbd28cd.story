European-based planemaker Airbus have opened up the doors of its new £1.9bn airliner.

The A350 aircraft was exhibited at a hanger in Tokyo earlier today.

The new model is a long-range, twin-engine  airliner, powered by two very quiet Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines.

It's also the first of its kind to have both fuselage and wing structures made up of 53 per cent carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer, which helps its fuel efficiency.

The revolutionary planes will be able to carry 250 to 350 passengers in a three-class seating layout. 

It has been created to provide direct competition to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. 

The jet is currently on a demonstration tour of five Asian countries which includes visits to Seoul Gimpo, Tokyo Haneda, Hanoi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.

With a cross-section of 220 inches from armrest to armrest, the A350’s cabin provides the widest seats in its category

Earlier this year, the same aircraft visited Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore on a route proving certification exercise. 

Airbus aims to deliver the first A350 jetliner to its first customer Qatar Airways by mid-December, the airline said on Tuesday.

Gulf News quoted its chief executive Akbar Al Baker as saying the mid-sized jet would be delivered between December 12 and 15‎.

'Everything is perfect,' he said.

The airline has 80 A350s on order, including 43 A350-900 and 37 of the larger A350-1000 models.

With a cross-section of 220 inches from armrest to armrest, the A350’s cabin provides the widest seats in its category.

The long-range, twin-aisle plane received was given certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week, after winning European safety approval in September. 

Airbus has booked 750 orders for the A350, including 549 for the A350-900 and 169 for the larger A350-1000, which is due to enter service in 2017.

The company hopes to build three A350s per month by year-end, up from two a month currently. 

By the end of next year it plans to build five a month and to hit 10 a month by mid-2018.
