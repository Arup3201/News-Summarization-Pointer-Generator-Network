About one in 100 people in the UK suffer from neuropathic pain

For those of us who are martyrs to our backs, help could be at hand – in a few years' time, anyway.

Scientists claim to have identified the gene behind back pain, in a development that could lead to effective treatment within a decade.

Experts at Cambridge University said their research into the HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions.

About one in seven Britons suffers from so-called chronic back pain, which can also include arthritis and headaches.

This chronic pain comes in two main varieties. Inflammatory ailments occur when a persistent injury results in very sensitive nerve endings, which increases the sensation of pain.

The other kind – neuropathic – is felt when nerves are damaged, causing ongoing, and often permanent, pain.

This is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy – as well as in cases of back pain.

When researchers removed the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves in mice, they put a stop to their neuropathic pain.

However, the mice were still able to feel acute pain, which occurs suddenly, such as when biting one's tongue.

Professor Peter McNaughton, lead author of the study and head of Cambridge's department of pharmacology, said a drug based on his team's research could be available within a decade.

'Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications,' he said.

'Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.'

Gene clue: The HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions

Professor McNaughton told the journal Science: 'Many genes play a critical role in pain sensation, but in most cases interfering with them simply abolishes all pain, or even all sensation.

'What is exciting about the work on the HCN2 gene is that removing it – or blocking it pharmacologically – eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain.

'This finding could be very valuable clinically because normal pain sensation is essential for avoiding accidental damage.'
