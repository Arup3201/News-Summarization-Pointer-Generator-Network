The Duchess of Cambridge on her wedding day. The diet guru who helped 
her get in shape for the occasion has been banned from practising

The diet guru who is said to have helped the Duchess of Cambridge fit into her wedding dress was today banned from practising as a GP for prescribing potentially lethal slimming pills.

Pierre Dukan, the 71-year-old Frenchman, is said to have lied to his patients about the Mediator pill, which has been linked to hundreds of deaths.

An eight day ban on working as a GP imposed by France's medical board is purely symbolic - Dukan voluntarily struck himself off the doctors' register last year.

But it is a huge blow to the image of
 a nutritionist whose protein-rich diet has earned him fame and fortune,
 and dozens of celebrity clients.

Sitting
 in Paris, the medical board ruled that Dukan was guilty of a 'breach of
 ethical regulations' for prescribing Mediator on five separate 
occasions, and then lying about what he did.

Dukan
 was also ordered to pay the equivalent of Â£5,200 in damages to a former
 patient who suffered heart difficulties in the 1970s after being told 
to take Mediator, even though it was only intended to treat diabetes.

The medical board ruled that Dukan had been dishonest, as he knew he was describing Mediator as a weight-loss pill.

'In
 resorting to untruthful assertions, Dr Dukan displayed behaviour which 
lacks probity and discredits the profession,' reads the medical board's 
ruling.

Dukan, who denies any wrong doing, said he would appeal today's ruling.

Mediator,
 which is thought to have caused up to 1,800 deaths in France alone, was
 withdrawn from sale in 2009 after evidence emerged that it damaged 
heart valves.

Jacques 
Servier, 90, the founder of the Servier biopharmaceutical company which 
produced the drug, is due to go on trial in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris,
 next year for 'aggravated fraud'.

Servier is accused of concealing the harmful effects of the drug, which was never authorised for sale in the UK and USA.

The
 Dukan diet boasts a host of celebrity followers, including Jennifer 
Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins.

Both the Duchess of Cambridge and her mother, Carole Middleton, are also said to follow it to maintain their figures.

Food
 experts have, in turn, warned the regime is a 'health hazard' due to 
its very low vegetable and carbohydrate intake, while the British 
Dietetic Association voted it 'the worst celebrity diet of 2011'.

Last year, France's College of Physicians filed a complaint against Dukan for suggesting pupils should be awarded higher grades if they manage to keep slim.

In a book out last year, he proposed creating a so-called 'ideal weight' option for A' level equivalent students in their final year exams, under which they would earn extra points for keeping slim.

The French College of Physicians warned the proposal could prove harmful for pupils already suffering from obesity or anorexia.

Fans: Brazilian super model Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, are two of the many celebrities who have followed the Dukan Diet
