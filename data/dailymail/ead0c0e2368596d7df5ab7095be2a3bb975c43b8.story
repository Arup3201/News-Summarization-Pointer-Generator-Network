Our Man In Havana has a certain ring: somehow it sounds so much better than 'Our Woman in Havana' - or Paris, Washington, Moscow or Tel Aviv. That, at least, was the view of the British Foreign Office until well into the 20th century.

Women served with distinction in diplomatic roles during the two World Wars, and the Foreign Office was happy to make use of the talents of mavericks such as intrepid travellers Gertrude Bell and Freya Stark.

And British diplomacy abroad was underpinned by the selfless (unpaid) efforts of diplomatic wives - who undertook the thankless task of ensuring the social side of embassy life ran smoothly.

Yet in 1936, the Inter-Departmental Committee On The Admission Of Women To The Diplomatic And Consular Services concluded after two years of deliberation that 'the time has not yet arrived when women could be employed either in the Consular Service or in the Diplomatic Service with advantage to the State or with profit to women'.

A Punch cartoon of the time showed a fashionable miss wearing an outrageously skimpy evening gown, perched on a brocade sofa with her feet on a tiger-skin rug, gnashing her teeth outside a firmly closed door labelled 'Foreign Office'. The caption read 'Foiled!'.

A decade later, the committee's conclusion was at last reversed and women were allowed to compete for posts in the Foreign Office, but until 1973 women diplomats who married had to resign.

'We doubt whether it will often happen that a woman will wish to remain in the Diplomatic Service after marriage,' concluded Lord Plowden's mid-Sixties review of Britain's overseas representation. 'In most cases, it will be her intention to settle down with her husband in this country or wherever he may be living.'

Even after the abolition of the marriage bar, promising female diplomats who had the temerity to get married were likely to find their careers stalled, if not entirely blighted.

The earliest contribution from a male spouse to the diplomatic spouses' magazine was in 1985, when one Guy Digby sent in a daring proposal to form a Diplomatic Service Husbands' Association, which would organise 'beer evenings' and 'poker afternoons'.

Pioneer: Gertrude Bell was archaeologist and explorer

Another diplomatic husband, Alex Sutherland, turned up at the wives' session on a heads of missions training day and was startled to hear the speaker announce that 'never, never, never should we leave the bedroom in the morning without having put on our make-up and our earrings'.

But as Helen McCarthy observes in her thought-provoking and vividly readable history of women's diplomacy, the urbane mandarins of the Foreign Office became almost animated in their determination to exclude women from a diplomatic career.

Not that they put it in such blunt terms. Along with the 'drunken sailor' argument against women diplomats, there was also the problem of that unsophisticated and misogynistic figure, Johnny Foreigner.

As the distinguished Old Etonian permanent secretary Sir Robert Vansittart wrote in an eight-page memo in 1934, 'He [the foreign male] is not ready for the experiment. It is surely a false argument to say that, because we treat women as equal to men in this country, an Englishwoman abroad will be so treated by foreigners. She will not.'

Yet as McCarthy points out, the Foreign Office never hesitated to make use of women's expertise when it was convenient - even in regions that it officially considered impossible for women to work in.

The Oxford graduate, linguist and travel writer Gertrude Bell gained a remarkable knowledge of the remoter parts of the Middle East and was elected to the Royal Geographical Society, which had only recently opened its membership to women, in June 1913. Soon after the declaration of war in 1914, the War Office wrote to her, asking her to produce a memo on the likely Arab response in the event of a British offensive against the Turks in the south-eastern Mediterranean.

By 1920, Bell's Review Of The Civil Administration Of Mesopotamia was published as a White Paper and she was acknowledged as a serious player in Middle East politics.

Paradoxically, she was hostile to feminism, a position she shared with numerous diplomatic wives, including Lady Granville, wife of the 3rd Earl of Granville, the Ambassador to Brussels, who argued that women could best serve their country by supplying wifely support.

'I have quite a decent brain,' she told the 1934 Inter-Departmental Committee, 'but I should not have thought at any moment of my life that I was capable of doing what my husband was doing.'

The rise of feminism in the Seventies dealt a mortal blow to such attitudes, though female recruits to the Foreign Office were still refused the opportunity of learning languages such as Arabic and, oddly, Japanese.

Women who queried the policy were grandly told - in an economical recycling of the old 'Johnny Foreigner' argument of the Thirties - that the Foreign Office had no choice but to 'take account of the fact that social attitudes remain in a number of countries which make it difficult for women to operate effectively in some jobs'.

Despite Robin Cook's reforms in the mid-Nineties, McCarthy concludes that the Foreign Office still struggles with its legacy of masculine privilege.

But her intelligent, witty and elegantly written book celebrates the remarkable tenacity of the women who defied that legacy.
