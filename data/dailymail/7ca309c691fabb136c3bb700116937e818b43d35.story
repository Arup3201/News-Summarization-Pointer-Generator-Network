Most Britons would be happy to pay more tax to save the NHS, a new poll has found.

Some 57 per cent of the public would be prepared to see taxes rise to protect the NHS, according to a new survey. Just over four in 10 voters said they would not.

The revelation comes amid warnings that the NHS could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase spending.

A clear majority of the public would be prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS, according to a new ComRes poll

All age groups are prepared to pay more tax to protect the NHS - except 35-44 year-olds - including three in five Conservative voters and two-thirds of Labour supporters.

The public also do not appear to care who provides their treatment - as long as it is free.

Some 67 per cent said they did not mind if health services were run by the NHS or by privately owned businesses, provided it was free, while 30 per cent disagreed.

A majority of Labour supporters - 59 per cent - say they do not mind who provides NHS services, with the working class least bothered of all.

The research, carried out by ComRes for The Independent, also found that voters trust Labour more than the Conservatives on health issues, with 33 per cent backing leader Ed Miliband to protect the NHS, and 29 per cent trusting Prime Minister David Cameron.

Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes, said: 'Beyond the economy and immigration, the NHS will be the key policy issue on which the 2015 general election is decided, and the fact that most Britons say they are willing to pay more tax in order to protect the NHS just goes to show the peril of being seen by voters to neglect it.

'Although traditionally it has been difficult for the Conservatives to get traction with voters on the NHS, voters seem to trust neither leader particularly to protect what is perceived as a valuable national institution.'

Meanwhile, Labour's poll lead has dropped from five to two points since last month, ComRes found.

Labour is on 32 per cent, down three points, the Conservatives are unchanged on 30 per cent, Ukip is up four points to 18 per cent, the Liberal Democrats are down one point to a record low of seven per cent.

ComRes interviewed 1,005 British adults by telephone between June 27 and 29 to gauge public support for extra health spending and the use of private companies to deliver services

David Cameron is less trusted than Ed Miliband to protect the health service from cuts - but only just - according to the survey

The public's support for higher taxes to pay for the NHS comes after senior MPs said the health service could collapse within five years if the Government does not increase health spending.

Over the weekend, former Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell called on David Cameron to boost the NHS budget as the economy recovered to avoid a crisis.

He was joined by the new chair of the Health Select Committee, Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who warned that it was 'hard to see how we could maintain current levels of service' if spending was not increased.

Paul Burstow, a Lib Dem former health minister, meanwhile said that the NHS needed an extra £15 billion over the next five years 'if you don't want the system to collapse during the course of the next parliament'.

Labour is intending to make the the NHS a key battleground at the next election and has promised a 'big offer' on health care.

It is considering three options to boost NHS spending: a ring-fenced rise in national insurance contributions for employers and workers; delaying the deficit-reduction programme and a budget increase once the nation’s books have been balanced.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to increase the NHS's budget amid warnings that the health service is facing a financial crisis

As Chancellor, Gordon Brown raised National Insurance by one per cent in 2002 to help bring Britain’s spending on health up to the European average.

Some Labour figures are wary that such a pledge now could undermine Mr Miliband’s 'cost of living' agenda as higher NICs would put more pressure on family budgets. But last night Labour supporters of a major health cash promise took comfort from the ComRes findings.

Patrick Diamond, a former Downing Street policy adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said: 'These poll findings demonstrate there is a real appetite among the British electorate for higher taxes to ensure the NHS remains on a sustainable financial footing.

'The key policy issue is how to make NHS spending more transparent so voters know how well the extra money is being used, combined with measures that widen choice and control over services to maintain the public consensus for a universal, taxpayer-funded NHS.'
