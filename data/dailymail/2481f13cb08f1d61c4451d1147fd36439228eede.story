Staring intently into the camera, a polar bear appears to be lost in thought while relaxing in the snow.

The giant animal, pictured in Wapusk National Park, located in northern Manitoba, Canada, looks like he has plenty to think about as he rests his chin on his paws.

These stunning images were taken by 39-year-old professional photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza, while on a seven day trip to the remote nature reserve.

Down time: Two polar bears cuddle together for warmth with one resting its chin on the other's back leg. The peaceful scene was captured by photographer Alberto Ghizzi Panizza

At times Mr Ghizzi Panizza, of Parma, Italy, was just three metres away from the polar bears.

He said: 'Polar bears are extremely dangerous and can be aggressive, so I had to be very careful when I approached them.

'Two bears approached us at one point and we had to make a quick exit from the area. It's quite scary, but I put the fear behind me and just continued taking the photographs afterwards.'

During his trip, Mr Ghizzi Panizza captured some fascinating scenes, including a playful brawl between two male bears and another pair of bears cuddling for warmth.

Alberto Ghizzi Panizza counted around 25 bears in the area and revealed he found it 'very emotional seeing these wonderful creatures in pure wilderness'

Arctic chill: The photographer endured minus 25 degrees Celsius temperatures and wind speeds of 80 kilometres per hour as he photographed the polar bears

'I counted around 25 bears in the area. It was actually very emotional seeing these wonderful creatures in pure wilderness,' he said.

The photographer endured minus 25 degrees Celsius temperatures and wind speeds of 80 kilometres per hour as he photographed the polar bears.

He added: 'The temperature was uncomfortable for me. However, it was the strong wind and snow that made it difficult to keep the lenses of the camera clear.

'Every time I exhaled, my breath would fog up the viewfinder.'
