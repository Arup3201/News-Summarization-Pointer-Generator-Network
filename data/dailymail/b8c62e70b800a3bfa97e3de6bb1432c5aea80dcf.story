A father has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke.

After the devastating episode Bob Cockshott, from Orpington, south east London, even looked at a picture of a couple holding a baby and didn't recognise it was him, his wife and their daughter.

The 58-year-old discovered he had suffered a minor stroke after he woke in the night thinking that he had gone blind. 

Bob Cockshott, from Orpington, south east London, has been left unable to recognise the faces of his wife or two children after suffering a stroke

Mr Cockshott was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition, but usually inherited

Doctors said the attack had been triggered by a blood clot on the brain and he was discharged once the swelling on his brain had gone down. 

He had thought that a slight loss of vision in part of his eye was the only lasting legacy of his stroke.

But he soon realised his problem was far more serious when he went to school to pick up his six-year-old son Alex and couldn't pick him out among the rest of the children.

And when he looked through family photo albums he found he couldn't recognise his own children when they were younger - or even a picture of himself.

Mr Cockshott said now his children are grown up he can't really remember what they looked like when they were younger

He also had difficulty identifying Clare his wife of 22 years if her hair was tied back in other photos.

Mr Cockshott was diagnosed with a severe case of prosopagnosia - otherwise known as face blindness - which is a surprisingly common condition, but usually inherited.

Since then he has struggled to recognise friends and workmates but copes by memorising people's distinctive features, such as posture, mannerisms and speech.

He has decided to speak out about it now to raise awareness of the condition.

Mr Cockshott, a director at the Knowledge Transfer Network - an initiative funded by the UK's national innovation agency - said: 'When I used to pick my son up from school all the kids were in their uniform so I was unable to recognise him.

Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. Mr Cockshott, who married Clare in 1993, is father to Alex, 13, and daughter Anne, 17, and says they have all come to terms with his bizarre condition since his stroke in 2008

Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces.

Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers.

Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object.

Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces.

The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities.

It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory.

Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases.

In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth.

It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion.

Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome.

Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes.

'There was a similar occasion at Charing Cross station with my daughter - she didn't tell me what she was wearing so I hadn't a clue who she was.

'I thought I only had a mild version of the condition but after I did some tests the doctors told me I had a severe impairment.

'It is very difficult to imagine really. People find it impossible to believe that I can't recognise their face.

'It is difficult for people I know to comprehend that my brain can't work out what they look like.' 

He added: 'It is only the faces that I can't recognise, so I can identify people by their hair or clothing or their mannerisms and posture.

'If there are people who look similar in the same place then I would really struggle. I wait for people to approach me.

'When I am in the supermarket my wife will whisper in my ear and say "That's John our neighbour" or something like that.

'If a picture of my wife was in front of me and her hair was tied back I wouldn't be able to say who it was.

'There was one time when I was looking at a couple holding a baby and I recognised the baby's outfit but I didn't realise it was me and my wife holding it.

'Now the kids are grown up I can't really remember what they looked like when they were children.'

Mr Cockshott, who married Clare in 1993, is father to Alex, 13, and daughter Anne, 17, and says they have all come to terms with his bizarre condition since his stroke in 2008.

Hazel Plastow, a director at Face Blind UK which Bob is a member of, said: 'You can't cure face blindness but there are lots of strategies to help cope with it if we can raise some awareness.

'People certainly become more isolated because it is just too awkward and embarrassing to put themselves in certain social situations.'
