Chelsea's Jose Mourinho, Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini and Manchester United's Louis van Gaal are among the managers named on FIFA's 10-man shortlist for World Coach of the Year. 

But Brendan Rodgers, who led Liverpool to second in the Premier League last season, has not made the list, which also includes World Cup-winning Germany manager Joachim Low, Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti and Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola. 

Rodgers' absence has been echoed in the shortlist for the 2014 Ballon d'Or, with former Liverpool striker and last season's Premier League top goalscorer Luis Suarez not nominated after a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

Mourinho  won the award in 2010 with Inter Milan, but no manager working in English football has ever claimed the top prize. 

Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was runner-up in 2011 and third in 2013. 

Diego Simeone will stake a claim to become the first Argentine to win the prestigious award after leading Atletico Madrid to their first La Liga title in 18 years.

However, Low will fancy his chances after winning the World Cup in Brazil during the summer by beating also-nominated Alejandro Sabella's Argentina 1-0 in the final.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp have also not been named. 

The award is based on votes from managers and captains of international teams, as well as journalists from around the world, and the winner will be announced on January 12, 2015.
