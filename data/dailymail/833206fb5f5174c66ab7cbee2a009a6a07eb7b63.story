Louis van Gaal announced his arrival at Old Trafford with a typically late 2-1 win over Valencia in Manchester United's final pre-season game.

Wayne Rooney missed a penalty before an emotional Darren Fletcher opened the scoring in the second-half and misfit Marouane Fellaini netted a late winner, despite being linked with a move away from the club.

Hot to Scot: Darren Fletcher celebrates after scoring United's opening goal in the second-half

Parting shot? Subsitute Marouane Fellaini came on to score a late winner

Take a bow: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal took charge at Old Trafford for the first time

David De Gea - 6

Little to do but left exposed for the goal. No question that he is United's first-choice after a superb campaign last time out.

Phil Jones - 7

Better in possession and made one outstanding recovery tackle as Rodrigo Moreno bore down on goal. Still prone to a lapse of concentration but the potential is there.

Chris Smalling - 6.5

Smart on the ball and robust in the challenge. Some at Old Trafford had their doubts last season but looks the part in the 3-5-2 system.

Tyler Blackett - 6.5

Favoured ahead of Michael Keane and impressed again at centre-back. Marcos Rojo will increase competition in the left centre-back position but Blackett deserves some opportunities this season.

On the spot: Wayne Rooney was made captain for the evening but missed a first-half penalty

Ashley Young - 6

Hard-working at wing-back and impressive delivery. Still has his limitations but cannot fault his dedication or work ethic under Van Gaal.

Darren Fletcher - 7.5

An inspiring tale of courage is having a happy ending. Fletcher looks back to his dynamic best and is forming a good understanding with Herrera. Well-taken goal.

Little P-45? Javier Hernandez was given a rare start despite being linked with a move away from United

Ander Herrera - 7

Some brilliant passing in the midfield and athletic work in recovering position. He will be vitally important to United this season.

Reece James - 6

Two years ago, he'd been released by Preston. Now he's playing at Old Trafford for Manchester United. James is only 20 and getting improving rapidly. Reliable back-up for Luke Shaw but Daley Blind remains on the United horizon.  

Play maker: New signing Ander Herrera (R) helped dictate the tempo of the game from midfield

Juan Mata - 5.5

Quiet in the hole behind the forwards but linked up well on occasion with Rooney and Herrera. Needs to influence the game more but nobody can question his talent.

Wayne Rooney - 5.5

Frustrating evening. Exaggerated the fall to win a penalty and then lashed it against the post. Touch also let him down a couple of times in front of goal. United captain on the night did not stop running and working for his team, though.

Change of system: Ashley Young was given another opportunity to impress in the wing-back role

Javier Hernandez - 5.5

Typically effervescent and sprightly in the final third but unable to convert with one header from close range. Admittedly the service could have been better.

SUBSTITUTE RATINGS

Lingard (for Smalling 62) - 6

Industrious and brought energy at a time United looked a little rattled.

Kagawa (for Young 62) - 5.5

Like Mata, barely featured as a link between midfield and attack.

Eastern promise? Shinji Kagawa failed to impress after coming on for Juan Mata

Cleverley (for Fletcher, 62) - 5.5

Sliced clearance handed the goal to Valencia. Has enjoyed a good pre-season but not the Old Trafford homecoming he'd have hoped for.

M.Keane (for Mata, 62) - 6

Talented youngster but doesn't quite look ready. If United bring in the defenders they are chasing, expect him to leave on loan to a Championship club. Blackburn and Cardiff lead the chase.

Fellaini (for Herrera, 76) - 7

Cruel treatment from United supporters, ironically applauding every touch. Classless from the fans and good on him for responding with a goal. Even if there may have been a foul on the goalkeeper...

Fancy a slice? Tom Cleverly played a part in Valencia's equaliser after a decent pre-season

Januzaj (for Hernandez, 76) - 6.5

The Belgian showed glimpses of the qualities that lit up Old Trafford last season. Interesting to see how Van Gaal finds room for him in the 3-5-2. Too good to leave out, really.
