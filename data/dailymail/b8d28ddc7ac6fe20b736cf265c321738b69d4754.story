Britain's recovery is slowing down, after new figures showed the economy grew by only 0.7 per cent in last three months.

The figure is down on the 0.9 per cent seen between April and June, and comes amid fears for the health of the global economy that have brought turbulence to stock markets.

Ministers insist they will 'keep a steady hand on the economic tiller' but face new pressure over lower than expected tax revenues and rising levels of borrowing.

The UK economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to September, down from 0.9 between April and June

The Office for National Statistics said every sector of the economy grew in the third quarter of 2014, from July to September. 

There was growth of 0.7 per cent in services, 0.5 per cent in production, 0.8 per cent in construction and 0.3 per cent in agriculture.

It means the economy is now 3 per cent bigger than it was a year ago, and 3.4 per cent higher than the pre-economic downturn peak at the start of 2008.

Chancellor George Osborne boasted the UK is 'leading the pack in an increasingly uncertain global economy'.

He added that it was a 'critical moment for the UK economy', warning: 'We face a choice: return to economic chaos of past or work through plan that's creating a brighter future.'

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Our recovery is now well established and creating jobs in record numbers. These GDP figures show the UK economy has good momentum to deal with a less certain global outlook. 

'Our plan is working and we need to stick to it. The families and businesses of Britain whose hard work is powering this recovery will judge harshly any party that threatens to squander this progress.

'Britain can't forget the deficit or believe unfunded promises. Being sensible with the nation's money is the bedrock of the Liberal Democrat approach. 

'We will keep a steady hand on the economic tiller because that is the only way to produce the stronger economy and fairer society that Britain needs.'

Chancellor George Osborne said the UK was at a 'critical moment' and warned against a change of economic course

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'For all George Osborne's claims that the economy is fixed most people are still not feeling the recovery. Working people are over £1600 a year worse off since 2010 and these figures now show a concerning slowdown in economic growth too.

'We need a strong and balanced recovery that works for all working people, not just a few at the top. But under the Tories we have stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs which, as the OBR said last week, are leading to rising borrowing. This plan isn't working for working people.'

The stagnating performance of the eurozone, Britain's main trading partner, is a key concern.

Last week the Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane signalled that gloomier prospects would push back the likely date for an interest rate hike well into next year.

Minutes from the latest meeting of the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee also showed a pessimistic view, arguing that gathering problems in the eurozone increased risks to a sustained recovery.

Uncertainty both abroad and at home - with the prospect of a looming general election in the UK - has led experts at EY ITEM Club to forecast strong expected growth of 3.1 per cent for 2014 edging down to 2.4 per cent next year.

The UK is also enjoying record numbers in work, and unemployment recently dipped below two million to an eight-year low, while inflation is at a five-year low of 1.2 per cent.

Yet productivity is flat-lining and wage growth, currently at 0.7 per cent, has been lagging behind the rise in the cost of living for six years.
