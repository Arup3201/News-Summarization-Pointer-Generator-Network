Dominic Solanke scored a super hat-trick as Chelsea's Under 19s comfortably dispensed of Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday afternoon. 

The Blues swept six beyond their Portuguese opposition in the UEFA Youth League and were irresistible in securing the group's top spot.

Jeremie Boga scored twice and Charly Musonda added another on an afternoon which means Adi Viveash's side can now look forward to a home tie in the last-16.

Solanke celebrates after scoring his second of the afternoon at Cobham 

'We scored some great goals, showed some super movement and scored a couple of excellent free-kicks - but we also demonstrated good discipline as well. Ruben Sammut was excellent in that sense,' the manager said. 'The speed of the game is different to the Under-18s but he learnt about that through the game and was very good.

'We're in the last-16, we're at home and we look forward to the draw now, as well as looking forward to this evening. 

'A big part of today for us as an Academy is Ruben Loftus-Cheek being involved with the first team, as an 18-year-old who has been here for 10 years.

'It's a big night for him and his family but also for all the coaches who have worked with him over the years. He's had a very good five months with us at the start of the season and he gets the reward for that tonight.'
