Notoriety: Richardson, pictured in 2007, was thought to have earned millions through his notorious gang's operations but left an estate worth just £21,000

Infamous London gang leader and rival to the Kray twins Charlie Richardson left an estate worth only £21,000 after his death.

The leader of the notorious 'Torture Gang' was thought to have earned millions from the racketeering crime empire he operated with brother Eddie in the 1960s.

Richardson - a heavy smoker- suffered from emphysema for years but he died in September aged 78 from what is understood to have been blood poisoning following a perforated gall
bladder.

But records show that despite his criminal enterprise - that included fraud, protection and gambling rackets - the gangster left only a paltry sum to his second wife Veronica, 58.

Richardson, from Snodland, Kent, did not leave a will but intestacy rules state that the small amount will pass to Veronica.

The father of six was one of the last of a 
generation of underworld faces from the 1960s who have passed into 
criminal folklore.

His trial at the Old Bailey shocked the nation, as details of how his gang tortured and intimidated their opposition were revealed in shocking detail.

While Richardson controlled large swathes of South London with his brother, the Kray twins held East London using similar techniques, and the gangs fought vicious turf wars.

Richardson was arrested on the day England won the World Cup in 1966 and 
his trial heard how he sought to extract information 
or money from his victims through, among other things, attaching 
electrodes to parts of their anatomy.

His gang were also claimed to have pinned victims to the floor with six inch nails and removed their toes with bolt cutters.

Richardson always denied the crimes and said the details were simply used to help jail his gang, adding that he was imprisoned 'for nothing'.

The judge said he had 'terrorised' those who crossed his path in a 
'vicious, sadistic' way.

At the gangster's funeral in Camberwell, South-East London, a floral tribute on one of the ten bronze Jaguars in the cortege read '240DC'.

The message left onlookers wondering if DC stood for direct 
current - a reference to his penchant for torture by electrocution.

The 250 mourners included 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 89, who was Richardson gang's 'enforcer' in his younger days, meting 
out 'dental treatment' by trying to remove teeth with pliers.

He received ten years for his part in the torture but became a minor celebrity in later life.

Despite a bitter feud which meant the Richardson siblings had not spoken for 20 years, Eddie was in attendance.

The service included a poem by his first wife, Ronnie, which said: 
'Many have judged him over the years, some good, some bad and said they 
feared.

'But they never knew this incredible man. A legend, a father - not 
gangland!'

Richardson escaped from an open prison in 1980 
and fled to France, but he was arrested and returned to jail before 
being allowed out on day release in 1984.

Following his release in 1984, Richardson sought to become a
legitimate businessman, wrote his autobiography My Manor and had a 
cameo in a film of his life.
