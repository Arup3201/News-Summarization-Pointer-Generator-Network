Former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu has claimed he was offered the job at Nottingham Forest and turned it down.

Dougie Freedman replaced Stuart Pearce this week, but former Rapid Bucharest coach Petrescu told DigiSport in Romania that he was approached by the Championship club.

'Everyone knows that I had offers from Nottingham. I had a clear offer, but the terms of the contract were not what I wanted. And the people there did not want to negotiate much.'

Freedman knows he needs to restore the confidence of his players if he is to revive Nottingham Forest's ailing season.

'Confidence is low,' said the 40-year-old. 'I'm not up on my stats about it but I know there haven't been many wins in the last few months, so that's understandable.

'Confidence is low because of results, there's no doubt about that, and that needs to change quickly.

'But there's many things you can do to change it. You can turn that around by managing players. Results do it too.

'Many things can bring confidence back to a team. The message you put across or the way you put it across can help. It might be a change in personnel or systems.

'I'll find the way to do. It's important because confidence can breed results and then you can get momentum and confidence continues to grow and before you know it you're climbing up the table.'
