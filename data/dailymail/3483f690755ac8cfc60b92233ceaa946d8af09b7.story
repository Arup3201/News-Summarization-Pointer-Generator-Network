Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi delivers an historic address to both Houses of Parliament, in Westminster Hall, in the Houses of Parliament this afternoon

Britain rolled out the red carpet for Aung San Suu Kyi today as she was welcomed by the Prime Minister at 10 
Downing Street, delivered a historic speech to both 
houses of Britain's Parliament, and then visited Prince Charles and the
Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House.

In the climax of her landmark visit to the UK, the Burmese pro-democracy leader became the only woman, other than the Queen, to address both houses of Britain's parliament.

The Burmese pro-democracy leader followed in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, Pope Benedict XVI and US President Barack Obama to be invited to make a rare address at Westminster Hall.

Ms Suu Kyi's historic speech followed a meeting with David Cameron at 10 Downing Street this morning, where the Prime Minister praised her as a global symbol of courage and hope.

Later this afternoon she then met Prince Charles and Camilla where she covered the roots of a black tulip magnolia sapling, on her first trip to Britain in 24 years.

Delivering the history speech in Westminster this morning, the Nobel peace laureate
said she was seeking practical help to address the problems still besetting her
country.

She appealed to Britain ‘as
friend and an equal’ to support the people of Burma in their drive for
democracy.

In particular, she said she hoped the UK could help rebuild
the education system while providing new investment for the future.

‘I am here in part to ask for practical help, help as a
friend and an equal, in support of the reforms which can bring better lives,
greater opportunities, to the people of Burma who have been for so long
deprived of their rights and their place in the world,’ she said.

‘My country today stands at the start of a journey towards,
I hope, a better future. So many hills remain to be climbed, chasms to be
bridged, obstacles to be breached.

‘Our own determination can get us so far. The support of the
people of Britain and of peoples around the world can get us so much further.’

Ms Suu Kyi, who received a standing ovation from MPs and
peers in a packed Westminster Hall, said the key to reform was the
establishment of a strong parlimentary institution.

She said that after 49 years of direct military rule, it
would take time for the country’s fledgling parliament to find its feet and its
voice.

She said Burma had not yet entered the ranks of truly democratic
countries but added: ‘I am confident we will get there before too long, with
your help.’

A
House of Commons' spokesman confirmed that Ms Suu Kyi was only the 
second woman to address both houses at Westminster Hall, after the 
Queen.

Earlier in the day David Cameron praised Aung San Suu Kyi as a global symbol of courage and hope as they met in Downing Street on her first trip to Britain in 24 years.

The Prime Minister declared the visit
as 'a great moment, that few expected and few dared to hope for', as 
they stood side by side at a Number 10.

'Over these years you have been a symbol of courage and of
hope for our people and for your people and around the world' he told the Burmese pro-democracy leader.

'Your example has inspired people across the world and it’s
inspired people here in Britain too.

Prime Minister David Cameron greets Ms Suu Kyi on the steps of No 10 Downing Street earlier today.

Mr Cameron said Britain would be a “staunch” supporter of
Burma’s steps towards democracy and confirmed that he had also invited President
Thein Sein to visit the UK.

“He too has shown considerable courage in leading the latest
reforms,” he said.

The Nobel peace laureate previously met the Prime Minister
in April when he became the first western leader to visit Burma following the
decision by the country’s military leaders to allow her and her party to stand
in parliamentary elections.

On that occasion, Ms Suu Kyi responded to his offer to visit
Britain with a cautious “Perhaps”. She had not left Burma in 24 years, fearing
that she would not be allowed to return if she did.

Mr Cameron said Ms Suu Kyi was “absolutely right to warn now
against reckless optimism” about the future of her country.

“We will remain vigorous and rigorous in our questioning
until we have made those changes irreversible,” he said.

Britain would invest money and people in Burma’s emerging
democracy, he said, including a delegation of MPs and peers visiting the
country next month to “scope the potential” for building the process.

It would also be investing £3 million in peace-building work
to address ongoing violence in Burma, and increase support each year for
education, healthcare, business and the rule of law.

“In a world beset by problems and difficulties, your example
of courage and determination has shone through,” he told her.

“If the Burmese people now fulfil their dreams, your country
will be a light in the darkness for all people who struggle for the freedom
that you ought to see for your country.”

Mr Cameron defended his decision to invite Mr Sein to
Britain, saying he believed the president was sincere in his commitment to
reform.

“There is a process of reform in Burma,” the PM said. “In
order for that to succeed we have to work with the regime.”

Ms Suu Kyi also met with Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague for a meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office today

He was backed by Ms Suu Kyi, who said: “We don’t want to be
shackled by the past. We want to use the past to build up the future.”

She said that after the years of struggle, the transition
now to democracy was “the most difficult bit” and she appealed to other
countries to remain vigilant about what was happening there .

“It is far more difficult than the years before when we had
to struggle,” she said.

“We are about to go forward on the most difficult road we
have ever walked.

“We will decide whether we are going to make the
breakthrough to democracy.

“More than ever we need our friends to be watchdogs. You
have to watch what is going on in Burma.”

It follows her emotional return to Oxford, the city where
she studied in the 1960s and where she settled with her late husband, Tibetan
scholar Michael Aris, in the 1980s.

Sir George Young told MPs in the Commons it was a sign of
the progress achieved that she felt able to visit the UK, confident of a return
to Burma, while he acknowledged a “heavyweight of expectation on her
shoulders”.

His comments came as shadow Leader of the House of Commons
Angela Eagle paid tribute to Ms Suu Kyi’s “enormous courage and determination”
in leading peaceful opposition to Burma’s dictatorship.

Ms Suu Kyi, who also met with Foreign Secretary William
Hague for a meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office today, was due to
address lawmakers from both houses of the British Parliament Thursday. She is
one of a few non-heads of state to be given the honour.

The
former Oxford University student also met with the Prince of Wales and the
Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House today, where the Ms Suu Kyi covered the
roots of  a black tulip magnolia sapling.
