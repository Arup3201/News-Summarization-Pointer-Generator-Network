Gary Neville believes the jury is still out on Louis van Gaal's Manchester United as they have yet to play any of the Premier League's leading lights.

United sit fourth in the table after an inconsistent start of three wins, two draws and two losses, but will be heartened by their last result - a 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford.

And while Neville, who spent 19 years as a player at United, believes the future is bright for his old side, he feels the coming month will prove how good Van Gaal's fledgling side is compared with their rivals.

The next month will show the true measure of Louis van Gaal's new-look United side, says Gary Neville 

'I think it's an exciting time,' Neville told United's official website.

'It's going to be an important few weeks but exciting as well. We'll find out in the next few weeks as the West Brom, Chelsea and City games are all massive ones that I'm going to be at and my thought is we'll find out exactly [the level] where the team is at this season.'

United face a trip to West Brom in their first match after the international break before hosting runaway league leaders Chelsea.

United have had some inconsistent results so far this season including a 5-3 hammering at Leicester City

And former Old Trafford stalwart Neville believes Van Gaal will find out the mettle of his side against teams of that calibre rather than the outfits they have faced so far.

He continued: 'It's going to be tough for United to get into the Champions League and that would be a big achievement. At this moment in time, we're in the places in fourth spot but we'll find out where we're at in the next few weeks.

'We've not really played anybody really strong yet. I know Everton at home could be classed as being a tough game but, in terms of really tough matches, Chelsea and City will provide a real measure of where this team is at.'
