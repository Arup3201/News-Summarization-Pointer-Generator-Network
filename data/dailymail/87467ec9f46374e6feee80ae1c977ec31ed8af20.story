Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking today at 10 Downing Street, spelled out his determination to stop taxpayers' money being used to bail out Greece

David Cameron today spelled out his determination to stop taxpayers’ money being used to bail out Greece.

He used forthright language to describe his attitude towards the bailed-out economy costing Europe a fortune at his weekly Downing Street press conference.

'We were not involved in the first bailout of Greece, we don't believe the European financial mechanism should be used in any way,' Mr Cameron said.

He told business leaders the UK had 
no obligation to help Greece other than through the International 
Monetary Fund because Britain had, ‘thank God’, stayed out of the euro.

The Prime Minister said he would make
 his position clear later this week at a summit for the 27 European Union 
leaders – a meeting which will be dominated by the debt crisis.

His comments came as eurozone finance 
ministers gave Greece two weeks to approve stricter austerity measures 
before they are prepared to sign off a second emergency loan of 
£11billion.

World stocks and the euro rose from last week's three-week lows today following the eurozone ultimatum.

Investors are awaiting a parliamentary confidence vote for Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, a step towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for foreign loans.

World stocks are down nearly 8 per cent from their three-year high set in May as investors grew worried disorderly restructuring of Greek debt would cause ructions in the market and hit the region's banking sector.

Parliament will debate the confidence
 vote against a backdrop of deep public anger over the pain of the 
austerity measures.

IMF and European inspectors have arrived in Athens 
to discuss changes requested by Greece to the reform package.

Unions and grassroots activists will 
protest at parliament ahead of the vote, building on more than three 
weeks of demonstrations that erupted into violence last week and split 
the ruling PASOK party.

If the confidence vote is passed, the Greek parliament will vote on the austerity measures by June 28.

Asked yesterday if Britain should contribute to
 the bailout, Mr Cameron said: ‘I absolutely don’t believe we should.

'I 
don’t believe that we will and I shall be fighting very hard to achieve 
that at the European Council this week.’

Speaking at The Times newspaper’s CEO
 summit, the Prime Minister said: ‘The first Greek bailout was done by 
eurozone members and I see absolutely no reason why Britain should be 
dragged in through European financial mechanisms or other mechanisms to 
support a subsequent Greek bailout.

‘We are not in the euro, we chose not to join the euro and so I don’t think we share responsibility for this.

‘Yes, obviously we are members of the
 IMF, we make contributions though the IMF to all countries, but I’m 
absolutely determined we should stay out of European efforts to put more
 money into Greece.

‘Of course we want a healthy euro. 
Forty per cent of our exports go to eurozone countries. We want the 
eurozone to sort out its issues.

WHAT'S NEXT?

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

Greece has a sovereign debt pile of 340 billion euros (£301 billion), more than 30,000 euros per person in a population of 11.3 million. The 110-billion-euro bailout Greece accepted last year from the European Union and International Monetary Fund has proved insufficient and a second package worth 120 billion euros is now under discussion. Greece's current debt is equivalent to 150 per cent of its annual output. Its people have lost patience with an ever-deepening austerity drive that has slashed public sector wages by a fifth and pensions by a tenth.

WHY DOES IT MATTER OUTSIDE GREECE?

The longer the crisis drags on, the greater the risk that contagion will spread to other troubled eurozone economies like Ireland and Portugal, which have also been bailed out before, and Spain, which is much bigger and would possibly be too expensive to rescue.

A default by Greece would hammer the banks that hold its debt, including the European Central Bank and big French and German lenders.

SO WHY NOT JUST BAIL GREECE OUT AGAIN?

The EU's big players - notably Germany, France and the European Central Bank - have struggled to work out a rescue mechanism. European governments are keen to avoid a 'hard default' because this could threaten banks in eurozone and further afield.

WHAT ABOUT THE GREEK PEOPLE?

Public disgruntlement over austerity - including curbs on widespread early retirement, tax rises and cuts in benefits and wages - has erupted into frequent strikes and protests, some of them violent. Unemployment is rising. In a poll last month, 80 per cent of people said they would make any more sacrifices to get aid.

HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?

Greece, whose economy had grown strongly but suffered problems with corruption and bureaucracy, joined the eurozone a decade ago. It went into recession in 2009 after 15 years of growth and its budget deficit hit 15.4 per cent of GDP after a series of revisions by the government which revealed the country's economy was in far worse shape than it had previously admitted.

The Greek crisis reflects an inherent weakness in the euro's structure - a currency zone with a "one size fits all" interest rate for a set of widely divergent economies, and 17 different countries running their own fiscal policies.

'But because we are not members of the 
euro I don’t think on this occasion in this country we have an 
obligation.’

A Treasury minister warned last night that Britain was preparing for the end of the euro.

If Greece’s debt crisis forced it to 
quit the euro, it would have ‘a very significant economic impact’ on 
Britain, said Mark Hoban, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

Officials said UK banks stand to lose £8billion if the Greek economy 
goes under.

It came as former Foreign Secretary 
Jack Straw led MPs from all sides in predicting the death of the single 
currency, warning: ‘Is it not better that it happens quickly rather than
 a slow death?’

He said the Government should be 
honest and admit the single currency is on the brink of collapse. He 
told the Commons: ‘The eurozone cannot last. In its current form [it] is
 going to collapse.’

The IMF also warned the Greek  crisis
 could threaten the stability of the entire eurozone, Britain’s biggest 
trading partners.

Mr Hoban admitted the Government was preparing 
contingency plans for a euro meltdown with the Bank of England and the 
Financial Services Authority.

He refused to say whether ‘the 
eurozone will stay intact’, a coded reference to Greece ditching the 
single currency.

But he added: ‘This crisis demonstrates the huge strain
 the eurozone is under. That’s why it was right for us to stay out of 
the eurozone.

‘The Treasury, together with the Bank
 of England and the FSA, are monitoring the financial system, including 
the euro area, on an ongoing basis. Many scenarios are considered.

‘Continued instability in the eurozone could be one of the factors that could hold back the recovery of the British economy.’

In a report yesterday, the IMF said the eurozone faced being ‘overwhelmed’ by the crisis.

It
 added: ‘Much remains to be done to secure a resilient monetary union.

'A
 strong core is pulling ahead of a periphery facing daunting challenges,
 with very high debt levels, severe competitiveness problems and fragile
 banking systems.

‘While
 courageous attempts have been made to address the crisis, policymakers 
are again facing uncomfortable dilemmas, raising uncertainty about the 
final outcome.’

The euro and the stock market took a tumble yesterday after EU finance ministers refused to give Greece the next £11billion slice of the £100billion European bailout unless it agreed to £25billion in cuts – a move that caused rioting in Athens.

The violence almost led to the collapse of the Greek government after thousands took to the streets in protest at the austerity measures.

Rioters clashed in bloody skirmishes with 5,000 police using stun grenades.

The fragile state of the 17-member currency was exposed by  Belgian finance minister Didier Reyders, who said Greece had lied about its finances for a decade while EU chiefs looked away.

Taxpayers face liabilities of around £1billion from Britain’s membership of the IMF.
