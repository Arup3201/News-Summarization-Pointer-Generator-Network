Patrons of a suburban watering hole were surprised to find a tiger joining them for a drink at the bar on Sunday evening.

The Siberian tiger cub called Shere Khan was brought into Uncle Richie's Bar in Lockport, Illinois by John Basile who owns nearby animal sanctuary Big Run Wolf Ranch.Â 

Amazed locals caught the bizarre incident on camera after Mr Basile, 57, strolled downtown with the tiger cub on a leash.

John Basile, pictured with a wolf on his wild animal ranch in Illinois, is facing charges of possession of a dangerous animal after taking his tiger into a bar

Ethan Autman, who caught the incident on camera, told CBS that the man appeared nonchalant about the outing.

Mr Autman said: 'He was thinking he didn't do anything wrong. I think he was kind of drunk, though.'

Uncle Richie's refused to comment to MailOnline today on whether Shere Khan sat at the bar or had anything to drink.

Big Run Wolf Ranch is a non-profit, educational program which cares for North American wildlife.

Along with the tiger cub, the ranch 
is home to ten wolves, a 450lb black bear called Kuma, a cougar, 
groundhog, coyote, raccoons and a porcupine.

The tiger cub reportedly bit a woman at Uncle Richie's in December but she did not report it.

Basile faces misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct, reckless conduct and possession of a dangerous animal.

Calls to Big Run Wolf Ranch were not answered today.

The animal ranch owner has a history of bringing his tiger cub into Uncle Ritchie's Saloon in downtown Lockport
