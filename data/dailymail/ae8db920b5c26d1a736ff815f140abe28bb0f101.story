Congressional Democrats continued to insist on Wednesday that Obamacare-related job losses would be 'a good thing' in the long run, as Congressional Budget Office chief Douglas Elmendorf testified in a House Budget Committee hearing that the Affordable Care Act 'creates a disincentive [for people] to work.'

House Budget Committee ranking Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland continued the White House's line from Tuesday, saying that the job losses indicate that consumers will have more choices after the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented.

'That is not a bad thing. Itâ€™s a good thing,' he said, suggesting that most of the eliminated employment would consist of older workers who would be able to retire early without losing their health benefits.

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell said that the nonpartisan CBO report didn't indicate that Obamacare would cause employers to cut jobs, but only that many Americans would chose not to work.

'This isn't employers cutting jobs,' he said. 'This is workers being empowered.'

But Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the committee's chairman, slammed the Obamacare law as a 'poverty trap,' calling it disastrous that so many Americans would become accustomed to receiving health insurance coverage without the need to provide for their families.

'Washington is making the poverty trap that much worse,' he said.

And the effect on the U.S. economy, Ryan claimed, 'will be severe, as if 2.5 million people had stopped working full-time by 2024.'

That finding is in line with the report the CBO issued on Tuesday just hours before White House officials began spinning the dour news as a positive development during a hastily assembled conference call for reporters.

'Over the longer run,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters later in the day,, the CBO 'finds that because of this law, individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families.'

One Democratic lawmaker, Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan, claimed during Wednesday hearing that being jobless would be a net positive for many people in his state. 'What that means is instead they might be able to tuck their child in bed at night and read a bedtime story, or go to an activity, which means theyâ€™re better off.'

The CBO report doesn't specify that the projected job losses stemming from the Obamacare law would be confined to elderly Americans who remain in the workforce because they need to keep their health insurance. Most retirees rely in part on Medicare, an existing government benefit that is available to all retirees.

It does, however, suggest that more and more lower-income Americans will no longer see the need to remain employed if they can get low-cost or free health coverage without working.

The report also found that the result of a mass flight from gainful employment will lower U.S. economic growth, shrink the tax base and raise America's budget deficits.

It estimated that the Affordable Care Act will cost taxpayers approximately $2 trillion over the course of the coming decade.
