A father-of-two almost died after Lloyds Pharmacy staff gave him the wrong medicine.

Richard Whipps, 38, who had a chest infection, was wrongly given diabetic medication instead of steroids for asthma by his local Lloyds Pharmacy.Â 

Although the sticker on the packet detailed the medication Mr Whipps was supposed to have the tablets inside were the wrong kind.

The sticker on the tablets he had been given had the details for the steroids Mr Whipps should have been given

Mr Whipps, who has three-year-old twin daughters, had to be rushed to hospital twice after he took the drugs and felt unwell.

It was only when Mr Whipps' wife Debbie researched the name 'Gliclazide' that was on the packet it was realised the medication was a hypoglycaemic anti-diabetic drug.

Doctors told him that if his wife had not been vigilant and got him to hospital on the second occasion he could have gone into a diabetic coma and died.

Mr Whipps,  an IT systems officer at the Arts University Bournemouth, said: 'The medication had 
been checked twice by members of staff at the pharmacy but they still 
got it completely wrong.

If his wife Debbie hadn't researched the name Gliclazide they wouldn't have found out why he was taking sick

'I felt horrendous but just thought 
it was a side effect of the steroids. I had no idea I had actually been 
taking the wrong medication.

'I am really angry about what happened and how serious it could have been.

'The nurse and the doctor at hospital
said it was very serious what had happened to me and that I was 
basically going into a diabetic coma.

'If my wife hadn't noticed and I had been left overnight, I could have been killed.'

Mr Whipps, from Verwood, Dorset, visited his GP with a chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics and steroids.

He had been given 30 Gliclazide pills instead of 30 Prednisolone tablets.

After collecting his prescription from the nearby pharmacy that evening he took six steroid tablets as instructed the following morning.

He began feeling unwell within a few hours and suffered an asthma attack.

He was taken by ambulance to Royal Bournemouth Hospital and released later that evening.

The next day he took his antibiotics and another six steroid tablets as instructed but again started to feel poorly.

Mrs Whipps checked the medication and discovered the box and drugs inside were actually for diabetics - even though the printed label stuck on the box contained the details for the correct medication.

He was rushed back to hospital and put on an IV glucose drip before spending the night on the acute medical ward while doctors corrected his sugar levels.

Mr Whipps said he was lucky his wife noticed he had been taking the wrong drugs or he could have died.

The Lloyds Pharmacy in Verwood that made the blunder. Mr Whipps is lucky that his wife spotted the mistake

He added: 'My wife's grandfather was diabetic so when she got home from work and saw how ill I was after the second time of taking them she looked at the medication and realised the mistake.

'I was feeling very ill and I was just sprawled out on the sofa and very spaced out. I'm incredibly lucky my wife noticed the mistake when she did otherwise I might not be here today.

'I'm absolutely disgusted by it to be honest. The package was signed by two different people so it wasn't just one person's mistake.

'There is no way I will be going back to that pharmacy again.'

Mr Whipps was contacted by the pharmacy and offered an apology.

A Lloyds Pharmacy spokesman said: 'We take the health of our patients very seriously and are extremely sorry that Mr Whipps was given the incorrect prescription medication.

'We have stringent standard operating procedures and a full investigation has taken place into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

'We will shortly share the findings of our investigation with Mr Whipps and have been in contact to apologise for any distress caused.'
