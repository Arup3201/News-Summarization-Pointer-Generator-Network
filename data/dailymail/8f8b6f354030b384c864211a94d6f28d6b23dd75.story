A leather jacket tagged by iconic artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and other legendary underground artists from the 1980s sold for $9,100 at a Manhattan auction yesterday.

The size 42 coat sold to an online bidder  at Swann Auction Galleries, just under its pre-sale high estimate of $10,000.

The auction house confirmed that the supple white leather jacket was sold by the original owner, Rico Espinet, who managed Danceteria from 1981 to 1986 and now owns an art and design store in Brooklyn.

During his time working at the club, Mr Espinet asked one of the elevator operators, a woman called Joy, to use the jacket as a blank canvas for celebrity guests to sign.

Her part in helping to create the artistic outerwear has been commemorated in its own tag, which reads 'Joystick' and can be seen scribbled in large black letters highlighted in blue on the jacket's verso. Its author is not known.

Mr Basquiat's contribution includes schematic drawings and the words 'breast' and 'corset'.

Fashion designer and artist Stephen Sprouse inscribed 'Serenity Prayer' in mirror image along the collar. 

Street artists Jep 2, Stash and Energy also left tags, all done in permanent black marker. The writers of some of the tags are not known.

Mr Basquiat had his start on the streets of New York. His first public exhibition was in 1980. One of his paintings sold at auction last year for $23.7 million.

He died in 1988 of a drug overdose at age 27. But while Mr Basquiat is gone, his art lives on.

Prints of 35 of his most famous works went on sale at Selfridges for the first time in October.

And the Brooklyn Museum is currently planning an exhibition on the artist that includes eight rarely seen notebooks filled with his handwritten texts and sketches, which will open in April.
