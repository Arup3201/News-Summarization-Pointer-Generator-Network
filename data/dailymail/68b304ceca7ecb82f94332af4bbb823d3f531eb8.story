Fans of Tom and Jerry are furious two episodes have been removed from the Golden Collection volume two

Fans of the classic cartoon Tom and Jerry are furious two episodes deemed 'inappropriate' because they feature the cat and mouse 'blacked-up' have been removed from a new collection. 

Warner Brothers' Golden Collection Volume Two was intended to be an uncut series of the popular animation in chronological order. 

But offending episodes Casanova Cat made in 1951 and Mouse Cleaning from 1948 have been pulled. 

In both episodes either the cat or mouse is 'blacked-up'.

In Casanova Cat Jerry's face is covered in cigar smoke before he is made to do a minstrel dance.

The box-set was also meant to go on sale two months ago but has yet made it into shops. 

Fans have been posting angry messages on websites where you can pre-order the Blu-ray DVD such as Amazon explaining why they won't be buying the discs.

One message reads: 'Culture is always reflected in cartoons, and while this may not have been right, it existed.

'It is a shame to omit pieces of history in a collection simply due to PR getting shaky boots over the past.'

Another posted: 'These releases are almost exclusively for the adult collector, so why treat us like infants?'

A campaign group has also appeared on Facebook called 'Unleash the banned Tom and Jerry cartoons.'

Despite a Warner Brothers spokesman telling the Independent on Sunday that the company felt certain content in the series would be 'inappropriate', when a Looney Tunes Golden Collection was released in 2005, actress Whoopi Goldberg was asked to explain why certain episodes were kept in the collection.

She said at the time: 'Removing these inexcusable images and jokes from this collection would be the same as saying (these prejudices) never existed.

'So they are presented here to accurately reflect a part of our history that cannot and should not be ignored.' 

The cartoon was created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and centred on a feuding cat called Tom and Jerry a mouse.

Hanna and Barbera wrote, produced and directed 114 Tom and Jerry shorts between 1940 and 1957 and the original series won seven Academy Awards.
