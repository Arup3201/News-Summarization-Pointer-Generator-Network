Reform: Ed Miliband wants maths and English to be compulsory until the age of 18

Ed Miliband wants all schoolchildren to study English and maths until they are 18.

The Labour leader will use his speech 
to the party’s annual conference today to propose an alternative to the 
A-level, called the ‘technical baccalaureate’, to address the needs of 
the ‘forgotten 50 per cent’ who do not go to university.

Aides said it would be the biggest education reform for decades.

Even those who fail English and maths 
at GCSE would study the subjects as part of the ‘gold standard’ 
vocational qualification for less academic pupils.

And A-level students who had passed 
with flying colours at GCSE would have to continue to study some element
of English and maths alongside their other chosen subjects.

Mr Miliband will suggest he wants to 
break the dominance of the elite universities, painting a picture of a 
country ‘where kids aspire not just to go to Oxford and Cambridge but to
excellent technical colleges and elite vocational institutions’.

He will suggest Britain’s education 
system works for only half the country, arguing that for too long both 
major parties have focused too heavily on young people who go to 
university.

And he will highlight his own 
comprehensive education in what is being billed as a highly personal 
speech full of ‘class war’ rhetoric apparently contrasting his 
background with that of David Cameron and George Osborne.

In what will be seen as a reference to
the Prime Minister’s comfortable upbringing in the shires, Mr Miliband 
will say: ‘My family hasn’t sat under the same oak tree for the last 500
years.

‘My parents came to Britain as immigrants, Jewish refugees from the Nazis.

‘I would not be standing here today 
without the compassion and tolerance of our great country, Great 
Britain, a country that my parents saw rebuilt after the Second World 
War.’

Labour is attempting to overhaul Mr 
Miliband’s image, casting him as a man of the people who understands the
concerns of ordinary voters.

The scale of the challenge is 
underlined by a poll today showing only a fifth of people think he has 
what it takes to be a good prime minister.

Asked whether Mr Miliband could be a good leader for the country, 22 per cent agree and 63 per cent disagree.

For Mr Cameron, the figures are 39 per
cent and 52 per cent. Labour’s seven-point lead in the last ComRes 
survey for The Independent a month ago has also dropped to just three 
points, with the party on 38 per cent to the Tories’ 35 per cent.

Mr Miliband’s schooling at Haverstock 
Comprehensive in Camden, North London during the 1980s is also the focus
of a Labour party political broadcast, dubbed ‘Ed: The Movie’, which 
will be screened tomorrow.

The campaign has divided Labour 
figures, with some believing it risks backfiring as Mr Miliband’s 
upbringing – as the son of Britain’s leading Marxist intellectual who 
was close to many senior members of the Labour aristocracy – was far 
from conventional.

In today’s speech, Mr Miliband will 
also suggest that businesses need to change their attitudes to overcome 
the economic crisis, condemning the ‘short term’ culture in parts of 
industry.

And he will argue that the country has
‘deep problems – about who Britain is run for, and who prospers in it, 
about one rule for those at the top and, too often, another rule for 
everyone else’.

But David Miliband yesterday admitted 
that his brother, who beat him to the Labour leadership, still had a 
‘mountain to climb’ to win the next election.
