A stylish prefabricated home has hit the market and it's so sustainably efficient it can put energy back on the grid.

ArchiBlox, an Australian architectural firm, has developed the world's first carbon positive prefabricated house, complete with an edible garden wall, sunroom and insulating grass roof. 

Over its life span, the Archi+ Carbon Positive House is expected to emit 1,016 tons of carbon dioxide less than a standard building with the same functionality.

It's the equivalent of planting 6,000 native Australian trees and taking 267 cars off the road.

'Archi+ Carbon Positive Houses will make significant contributions within society by addressing the increasing levels of carbon emissions and the high levels of embodied energy that come with the construction of a standard home,' the company said.

'These aspects will drive us to balance the amount of carbon emissions released with the equivalent amount sequestered.' 

Design features of the carbon positive home include in-ground cool tubes to help with cooling, sliding edible garden walls to block the sun and a green roof for thermal insulation.

The airtight design of the building helps to save energy and protect sound, with hard wired data lines to reduce electromagnetic radiation

The 75-square-metre home is mobile because it's prefabricated, but will cost about $4,000 per square metre.

The house, which is currently on display in Melbourne's City Square, was awarded a platinum star for the life cycle assessment and the dwelling's performance on greenhouse gas emissions and the overall sustainability features. 

There's no mechanical heating or cooling in the home - external shading devices are used to filter the harsh solar radiation in summer and then can be retracted in winter to keep the house warmer.

While the house is small and will guarantee less use of electricity, ArchiBlox says functionality of the place hasn't been compromised. 

'These homes will give our clients the opportunity to rid themselves of modern day lifelines in a house that has been developed through a collaboration of design sensitivities and new technologies with like-minded companies.'
