A teenager murdered his ex-girlfriend and dumped her body in a bayou after she told him she had started seeing someone else, police have said.

Luan Vu, 19, drew a map for police on Wednesday night and led them to the body of 17-year-old Vy Ngoc Bao-Pham, which he had allegedly dumped in the Sim Bayou in Houston, Texas.

He told police that he had wanted to confess to the killing the previous day, but that he had 'heard they were good' and had wanted to test their investigative skills, Detective Fil Waters said.

Police said they believe they know how the girl was killed but are waiting for confirmation from her autopsy before releasing further information.

'Killer': Luan Vu, left, has allegedly confessed to killing his ex-girlfriend Vy Ngoc Bao-Pham, right, on Monday. Although he is seen posing with a massive gun on his Facebook page, police say he strangled the teen

According to court documents seen by the local ABC affiliate, there was a sock stuffed in Vy's mouth and ligature marks around her neck. He had choked her, knocked her out with a tree branch and then strangled her.

Detective Waters said that the suspect was 'obsessed' with Vy.

'They
 had matching tattoos on opposing shoulders of a compass, and he told 
her that he would be able to find her wherever she went,' he told 
reporters, KHOU reported.

The tragic discovery came after an Amber Alert was issued for the 5'1 high school student, who was last seen at her apartment block on Monday.

Vu allegedly saw Vy and questioned her about her new boyfriend.

Motive: Officers said 19-year-old Vu, pictured in photos on his Facebook page, was 'obsessed' with his ex-girlfriend and murdered her after learning that she had a new boyfriend

'He stopped her and said, "We need to talk." She said, "I'm done talking",' Waters said, according to the Houston Chronicle.

He then told her she needed to come with him for furter talks.

'She said, "I'm not going with you anywhere" and he said, "Oh yes, you are,'" Waters said.

Police say he then killed her and then wrapped the body in a sheet, before sliding her into the bayou under a bridge on Monday night.

After her disappearance, her parents received a text message in broken English demanding $50,000 for Vy's safe return. The message, which said they had two weeks to pay, was traced back to Vu.

'He sent the note to deflect what had happened to her,' Waters said.

Waters said that Vu, who has been in the U.S. for five years, had admitted to 
investigators he was going to confess on Tuesday, when he was questioned along with other friends and family.

But he told authorities that he had heard in his native Vietnam that 'they were good' and wanted to 'put them to the test'.

'We are happy to say that we validated everything that he had heard,' Waters said.

Vu remains in jail and has been charged with capital murder.
