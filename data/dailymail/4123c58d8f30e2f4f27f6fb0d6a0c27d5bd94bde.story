Lewis Hamilton’s victory was his seventh of the season, three more than Nico Rosberg and two more than the Briton secured during his championship year of 2008. 

He has now led 63 grands prix during his 143-race career, surpassing David Coulthard’s British record. Michael Schumacher’s all-time record is 142.

Singapore is one of the toughest tests on the calendar given the searing heat, humidity and the race’s length — yesterday’s reached the two-hour limit before the scheduled number of laps was completed — and it appeared to take its toll on the rookies.

Daniil Kyvat, 19, asked to park his Toro Rosso after his drinks bottle failed before the race started, while McLaren’s Kevin Magnussen, 21, required medical attention for burns following an unexplained build-up of heat in his cockpit.

He, too, was unable to take on liquids during the race and was seen with his arm raised in a bid to direct cool air down his back. ‘It was the hardest point I’ve ever earned,’ the Dane said after finishing 10th.

In the wake of Rosberg’s arm-waving retirement (right) on lap 13, and the conspiracy theories which followed the Italian Grand Prix, Lotus rather mischievously tweeted: ‘@nico_rosberg now wondering if anyone will notice if he joins the @MercedesAMGF1 crew for the next @LewisHamilton pit stop…’ 

Unsurprisingly, the Hamilton fans, adamant Mercedes have been conspiring against their man all season, were rather quiet on the social-media front yesterday.

With Hamilton now leading the table, it’s worth recalling his four wins on the spin in Malaysia, Bahrain, China and Spain. On the 21 occasions a driver has won four straight races, they’ve gone on to take the title. 

Rosberg’s day got off to a bad start when the car chosen to show him off to the crowd — a 1958 Mercedes-Benz 300SL — stalled with him on the back.

The Singapore Grand Prix kept its unique record of seeing a safety car deployed at every race since its inception in 2008 after Sergio Perez’s front wing shattered across the track.
