England could be looking for a new bowling coach for the Ashes after David Saker confirmed he would be returning to his native Australia to coach Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League.

Saker, 48, who has been with England for five years, has a six-month termination clause in his ECB contract, which could yet mean he sees out the summer in this country before heading home. 

But he is keen to move back to Australia sooner rather than later, and also hopes to become head coach of a state side in the first-class Sheffield Shield competition – with Victoria the favourites.

If the ECB do allow Saker to head home before the Australians arrive to defend the Ashes this summer, that could pave the way for the return of Ottis Gibson, who quit as West Indies coach last year and was Saker's predecessor in the England fast-bowling role.

Saker told the Melbourne Age: 'My first three years in the job for English cricket was a bit of a fairytale. But like most things it's hard to keep that form up. We lost some senior players, which made it a little bit harder.

'I'm sure everyone in the Australian camp don't think they can just walk up and win the Ashes. If they think that they've got something very wrong with them, because England in England are always hard to beat.'

Saker's exit could open the door for Ottis Gibson, pictured with Anderson in 2007, to return to the role
