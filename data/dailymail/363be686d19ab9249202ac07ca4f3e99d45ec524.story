This much-anticipated supermoon has hit its peak, but the biggest, brightest moon of the year should still be visible until Tuesday.

The supermoon appeared 14 per cent larger and 30 per cent brighter than it does at its smallest appearance and dimmest glow.

The moon is, of course, the same size as usual but appeared larger for two reasons: it was at its closest orbit to earth at the same time as it hit full moon phase. As a result of the timing of these two events, the moon appeared larger and brighter than usual.

The moon was closest to Earth at 4:32 this morning, but it should still appear larger and brighter than normal until Tuesday.

Social media has lit up around the world with amazing photos of the supermoon.

The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, according to USA Today.

Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth.

While this supermoon, which rose in the east yesterday, is spectacular, an even larger one is expected on September 28, 2015.

And the largest supermoon until 2034 will roll in on November 14, 2016.Â
