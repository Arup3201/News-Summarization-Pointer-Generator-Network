Arsenal’s chances of landing Sami Khedira have all but disappeared with the player now needed to replace the injured Luka Modric until the end of the season, when he will leave Real Madrid on a free transfer.

The Gunners failed to bring the World Cup winner to the Emirates in the summer but looked like getting a second opportunity in the summer with Real still willing to let Khedira leave for around £5million in January rather than lose him for free in the summer.

But Modric is out for three months having torn a tendon in his thigh and Carlo Ancelotti said on Wednesday: 'We will solve the problem because we have Kroos and Khedira as a World Cup-winning pairing and Isco can also play there.'

Sami Khedira should be available on a free transfer in the summer, with Bayern and Chelsea leading the way

Khedira’s form between now and the end of January in Modric’s place could yet force Madrid to improve the rejected offer they made the player last season.

But it seems more likely the player will sign a pre-contract agreement in January with Bayern Munich favourites over Chelsea for his signature.

Jose Mourinho is a massive fan and has already signed Khedira once when he was at Madrid.  Bayern are slight favourites because they favour players returning to Germany.

Khedira is now needed by Real Madrid because of the injury to midfielder Luka Modric

If the Bundesliga champions do capture the 27-year-old, who captained Germany in their 1-0 win over Spain in Vigo on Tuesday, it will be a victory for chairman Karl-Heinze Rummenigge over coach Pep Guardiola.

The former Barcelona manager is not Khedira’s biggest fan and is still unhappy that the club allowed Toni Kroos to leave for Real at the start of the season.

Rummenigge, however, sees signing Khedira on a free having sold Kroos to Madrid for £30m after the World Cup as good business.
