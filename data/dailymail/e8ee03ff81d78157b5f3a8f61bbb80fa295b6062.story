Superstitious foresters have refused to fell an ancient tree in southern China - because it looks too much like an Ent from the Lord of the Rings film.

Tree surgeons won't go near the landmark - nicknamed Treebeard after the Ents' leader - after one worker fell from a ladder breaking a leg trying to trim its branches.

Another forest worker was mowed down by a car and hospitalised with multiple injuries on his way to take over the pruning in parkland near Nanning city.

'No-one wants to go near it now. That tree can look after itself. It's dangerous.

'If it falls down, it can do it all by itself.

'We're not going near it,' said one colleague.

In the original Lord of the Rings story, Ents are a race of beings in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy world Middle-earth. They are tree-like giants who protect forest trees from anyone who tries to cut them down.

A city parks spokesman explained: 'Many visitors have shown an interest in the tree and what it looks like so we have decided to keep it.'
