Gerry Adams has admitted the IRA sentenced suspected paedophiles to death using kangaroo courts but has denied claims he covered up the alleged rape of a commander's niece.

It came as it emerged British secret services blackmailed former IRA chief of staff Joe Cahill to spy for them after he was allegedly caught abusing a 14-year-old girl.

His niece Mairia Cahill, 33, says she was raped by a different suspected IRA member when she was 16 and Mr Adams and others interrogated her and made to attend a face-to-face meeting with her abuser.

Mr Adams denies her claims but admitted that the IRA had interfered with sex cases and had failed victims.

Turned? Former IRA Chief of Staff Joe Cahill, left with Gerry Adams, spied for the British after being caught abusing a 14-year-old, it was claimed today

Adams admitted the IRA's kangaroo courts for sex offenders meant they were 'ill-equipped' to deal with the issue.

He wrote on his blog: 'This included very sensitive areas such as responding to demands to take action against rapists and child abusers. The IRA on occasion shot alleged sex offenders or expelled them,' he said.

'While this may have been expedient at the time it was not appropriate.

'Victims were left without the necessary social service support and abusers without supervision. It ultimately failed victims and the community alike. That is a matter of profound regret for me, and many other republicans'.

Today the Daily Mirror claimed the IRA's former Chief of staff Joe Cahill was photographed by a covert unit in his car but never prosecuted -  instead he was convinced to share secrets about the IRA's leadership, it was claimed today. 

Cahill, who died in 2004 and whose coffin was carried by Gerry Adams and  Martin McGuinness, was considered one of Britain's 'prized assets' in Northern Ireland, it was alleged.

As a member of the IRA's leadership Cahill would have had detailed knowledge about its bombing campaigns and would be involved in arming members and raising funding for terrorism. 

Today a security services source has claimed Joe Cahill was followed around Belfast by spies in the 1970s before he was caught abusing the 14-year-old child. 

Officers then turned him to spy for Britain during the Troubles.

'The pictures clearly identified both Cahill and his victim,' the source told the Daily Mirror.

'Her father would have killed him if he had found out. He was never prosecuted and instead the pictures were used to turn him. He was a prized asset.'

Cahill was a founding commander of the modern Provisional IRA that killed nearly 1,800 people during a failed 1970-1997 campaign to force Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom.

He himself was sentenced to death for killing a policeman in the 1940s, but this was changed to a life sentence after pressure from Britain by the Irish government and the Vatican.

He served less than ten years before his release but jailed again during the IRA's Border Campaign of the 1950s.

The new allegations about Cahill being a double agent means he may have been working for one of several secret services units working in Northern Ireland at the time.

Members would spy on Republicans and female members were known to have sex with IRA members for information. 

Cahill's alleged role as a British agent was only known to a small number of people but an IRA source told the Mirror there were suspicions he was an informer.   

Last week Adams also faced new accusations that he concealed child-abuse crimes within his own secretive movement, this time allegedly committed by a Belfast officer of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.

Mairia Cahill, a member of one of Belfast's top IRA families, appeared alongside a former foreign minister outside Ireland's parliament to accuse Adams of conspiring to suppress her reports of being raped by an IRA commander from Adams' home district in 1997, when she was 16.

Cahill is a grand-niece of Joe Cahill, but she was not his victim. She received legal anonymity when she went to police with her accusations.

In 2012 the man she accused of raping her, Martin Morris, was charged with IRA membership and 13 counts of sexual assault.

He always denied her claims and was acquitted of all charges. 

Four others were charged with IRA membership based on Cahill's accusation that they interrogated her several times in 1999 and 2000 about her accusations against Morris, when the IRA attempted to determine whether Cahill or Morris was telling the truth. 

She said at one point the IRA forced her to confront Morris face to face. Prosecutors withdrew the case without explanation earlier this year.

Cahill waived her anonymity in a BBC documentary broadcast last Tuesday, during which she accused Adams of telling her she might have enjoyed the abuse.

Adams acknowledged meeting Cahill around that time, but rejected her account and denied knowing of any IRA inquiry into her case.

Last year the paedophile brother of Gerry Adams was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter.

Liam Adams, 58, was found guilty  of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child Aine Dahlstrom when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The 40-year-old, who has waived her right to anonymity, wiped tears from her eyes as she watched him jailed.
