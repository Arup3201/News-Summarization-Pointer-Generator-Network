A crocodile-like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago, a new study has found.

Palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the 'super salamander' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern Portugal.

The predator, which grew to be around two metres (6.5 ft) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the Late Triassic Period, has been named Metoposaurus algarvensis.

With a mouth filled with sharp needle-like teeth it is thought to have preyed upon fish but could also have snapped up any small early dinosaurs that got to close to the water.

The researchers behind the discovery, which was made in mudstone flats close to Loulé, in the Algarve region of southern Portugal, say that the new species was similar to other primitive amphibian that were widespread at the time.

The rare giant salamander is thought to be one of the world's oldest species.

It first appeared on the planet around 170 million years ago but there are now just a handful of surviving populations left in the wild.

The Chinese giant salamander are now the largest living amphibians and can grow to be up to 1.8 metres (5.9 feet) in length.

However, pollution of the rivers and streams where they live has put the species under threat.

A park ranger in southern China recently caught a giant salamander weighing 5.5kg and measufing 83cm in length in Heyuan City in southern China's Guangdong Province, the first of its kind to be found in the area. 

After keeping it in a temporary tank, officials released the creature back into the river, watched by a crowd of fascinated tourists.

They say they were probably the forerunners of modern amphibians such as frogs, newts and salamanders.

Dr Steve Brusatte, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who led the study, said: 'This new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie.

'It was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut.

'It was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water, long before the glory days of T. rex and Brachiosaurus.'

The researchers, whose work is published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, discovered the remains of Metoposaurs algarvensis on the bed of an ancient lake.

It was found within a large bed of bones where several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake dried up.

So far the researchers have excavated just four square meters of the lake and say they could find hundreds of creatures preserved in the mudstone.

Most species of giant salamander-like amphibians were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago which marked the end of the Triassic period.

This was when the supercontinent of Pangea began to break apart and paved the way for the dominance of the dinosaurs.

Other species of Metoposaurus have been found in parts of Africa, Europe, India and North America.

Dr Richard Butler, another researcher involved in the study and a palaeontologist at the University of Birmingham, said: 'Most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless.

'Back in the Triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be.'
