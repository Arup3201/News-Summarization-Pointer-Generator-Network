Bob Dole has claimed that Ronald Reagan would not have made it in the modern day Republican party because he was too mainstream.

The former GOP Presidential candidate said that the man idolized by his party would have struggled as his supporters have moved so far to the right.

Dole also said that the Republicans were in such a state they needed to hang a 'closed for business’ sign on their front door and embark on a period of introspection to find out who they really are.

Speaking out: In an interview that aired on Sunday, former senator Bob Dole said that Republicans were in such a state they needed to hang a 'closed for business' sign on their front door

Would he have made the cut: Dole says that Reagan wouldn't stand a chance in the GOP if he were alive today

His damning indictment of the GOP reveals that schism that is taking place within the party after its miserable loss to President Obama in last year’s election.

The Republicans are now searching for a candidate to unite them for the 2016 election where they will most likely face Hillary Clinton.

But speaking on Fox News Sunday, Dole said that Reagan - who served two terms and became known as 'The Great Communicator' - wouldn’t even stand a chance if he were around today.

When asked if he himself could be the modern-day GOP candidate, Dole said: 'I doubt it. And I - Reagan wouldn't have made it.

'Certainly Nixon couldn't have made it, because he had ideas and, we might have made it, but I doubt it.'

Asked if he meant it was because they were both too moderate and willing to compromise, Dole said: ‘I just consider myself a Republican, not all this hyphenated stuff.

Dying breed: When asked if he himself could be the modern-day GOP candidate, Dole said: 'I doubt it. And I - Reagan wouldn't have made it'

‘I was a mainstream conservative Republican, most people are in that category.’

On the face of it, many of the things that Reagan did would horrify Tea Party Republicans.

He bailed out social security to the tune of $165bn and whilst governor of California passed pro-choice legislation, something which would rule him out as a candidate nowadays.

Reagan was a former union man having been part of the Screen Actor’s Guild in his Hollywood days before entering politics.

Once in the White House he also raised 
taxes to deal with a soaring budget deficit - something the Tea Party is
refusing to do today in a similar situation.

The old days: Dole pictured with Reagan in 1976, says the Republican Party should just hang a 'closed for repairs' sign until next year

On Fox News, Dole said that the GOP needed to stop being so negative and work out what they stood for.

He said: 'I think they ought to put a sign on the national committee doors that says "closed for repairs" until New Year’s Day next year. Spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas.'

Dole, now 89, lost out to Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. election and also served in the House and the Senate representing Kansas for some 40 years.

During that time he was Senate Majority Leader and, for two years, chairman of the Republican National Convention.
