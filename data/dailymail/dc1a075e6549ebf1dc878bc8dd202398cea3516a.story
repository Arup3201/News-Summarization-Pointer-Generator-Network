Items going under the hammer include a flawless 5.16 carat diamond ring, made for the Princess in 1970, that is expected to fetch  £750,000.

A Cartier watch bought for Princess 
Margaret by the Queen Mother for her 20th birthday will also feature in 
the sale. The Queen Mother purchased the art deco watch second hand from the famous 
jewellers in 1940 for just £100.  It is now worth £150,000.

Seal of approval: All of the items on sale have been authenticated by Princess Margaret's son Lord Linley

Royal treasures: The items have all come from the Princess' apartment in Kensington Palace

Meanwhile, a solid gold clock with the princess' initial with a crown over it is expected to fetch up to £140,000.

Other items for sale include trinkets, paintings and photos of the Princess, the Queen's sister, with prices beginning at £2,000.

A spokesman for Riverside Antiques 
said: 'All of the items on sale have been authenticated by Princess 
Margaret’s son Lord Linley.

'What is so compelling about the 
collection is that it is part of the fascinating and sometimes turbulent
life of the Princess and many of these items were personally used or 
worn by her.'

Also for sale, but not at the fair 
because of its size, is a four poster bed which was made for the royal 
Princesses’ grandparents. It resided mainly at Glamis Castle where 
Princess Margaret was born and is widely believed to be the bed she was 
born in.

Antiques For Everyone runs at Birmingham's NEC from 4 to 7 April
