Young stars from Chelsea and Manchester City feature prominently in the England Under 19 squad selected by Sean O’Driscoll for the forthcoming round of European Championship qualifiers in France.

The Young Lions travel across the Channel next week as they bid to secure their spot at the finals being held in Greece in July.

They will play three Elite Round qualifiers, against Denmark on March 26, Azerbaijan on March 28 and France on March 31 with only the team that tops the group advancing to the finals.
