Marvel has unveiled the titles of its upcoming superhero films through 2019 - including its first ever movies starring female and black superheroes. 

And Chadwick Boseman had the support of pros Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans amid the exciting news that he will play T'Challa, also known as Black Panther, in a 2017 movie.

'I'm blessed to be part of this Marvel universe. I look forward to making magic together,' the Brooklyn-born 37-year-old said on stage at the  El Capitan Theater in Hollywood on Tuesday.

The Iron Man and Captain America stars were on hand to give the rising star - who just played James Brown in biopic Get On Up - a pat on the back. 

Fans of Marvel comic books will know that T'Challa is the royal leader of an African nation bestowed with super powers. 

Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige said Black Panther will first be introduced in the 2016 film Captain America: Civil War, which will pit Iron Man and Captain America against each other.

Another exciting announcement was that a Captain Marvel adaptation is on the way - although audiences will have to wait until 2018 to see the studio's first female superhero on screen.

It is not yet known who will play the character - also known as Carol Danvers, who graduated from Ms. Marvel to Captain Marvel.

Carol, who has been associated with The Avengers and X-Men in the comics, is described as having abilities from flight to shooting energy from her hands.

Doctor Strange will be coming to cinemas a lot sooner, and is slated for a 2016 release. 

But despite rumours that Benedict Cumberbatch is in talks for the role, Marvel said no decision has been made on who will portray the Sorcerer Supreme.

According to Reuters, studio president Kevin Feige said: 'We are excited to tap into what excites us the most, which is the supernatural.

'If [casting] were confirmed, we would have introduced him today. Every single actor of a certain age has been rumoured to be Doctor Strange.'

The well-oiled Marvel machine is clearly dedicated to expanding its horizons and franchises in Phase Three, particularly with diversity.

But current hit sagas are certainly not losing any steam, with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Thor: Ragnarok set to hit screens in 2017.

The movies join next year's The Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man.

A final flourish for the next five years comes in the form of Inhumans in 2018, which would bring a whole new group of heroes to the screen. 

Good news for fans: In the next five years there will be two more Avengers movies, as well as the third Captain America film also featuring Iron Man

At the announcement on Tuesday Feige said that he hopes this will spur many other spin-off movies.

The Phase Three calendar announcement may have been an extraordinarily exciting event for Marvel fans, but it seems it was just another day for Robert Downey Jr.

The actor, still clad in his blue suit, headed from the bash to the DMV in Santa Monica, where he got his driver's license renewed and shared photos of it on Twitter.
