If you saw yesterday's MailOnline story about the horned hats and live goldfish handbags on display at the Central St Martins's graduate fashion show and thought the latest styles couldn't get any more bizarre, think again.

The graduates at London's Royal College of Art trumped their peers with their latest catwalk collections.

Some of the most unusual styles came from menswear designer Lucie Vincini who accessorised her models with gold mouthpieces that hung from their mouths exposing their teeth.

The fashion statement is a no-no for anyone self-conscious about their gnashers or anyone with a fear of the dentist - given it looks like a painful implement that you might expect to endure when sat in the chair for treatment.

When it came to their clothing, some of Vincini's male models wore diamante skull caps, while for footwear they all wore trainers.

The young designer hinted that she wants to make double denim (or even triple denim) an acceptable trend with one of her styles involving a man wearing a denim skirt over denim trousers with a shirt of the same fabric.

Another of her models took layering to a new extreme wearing multiple garments topped off with a large white quilted jacket.

Not to be out done on the catwalk, another of the student fashion designers had some eye-catching styles on display in her collection.

Japanese designer Maiko Takeda had an array of spiky headwear on show that looked like it had been inspired by nature.

Some of her pieces were reminiscent of a hedgehog while another looked like a furry caterpillar wrapped around a model's head.

Sticking out: Meanwhile this hat is certainly eye-catching

Bewildering: Can the model see where she's going in this unusual creation?

The designer said her aim is to 'create an experience of wonder and bewilderment for the adorned'

Futuristic: Her prickly designs also extend to clothing

Takeda writes on her website that her aim is to 'create an experience of wonder and bewilderment for the adorned.'

And her hats seem to do the trick as it appears the wearer cannot see where they are going thanks to some of spiky styles covering their whole face. And one might wonder who would actually wear them.

The designer carried the spiky theme into her clothing range and this did seem more wearable with one style covering the shoulders like a futuristic fur stole.

Spice Girl-style platforms complete the unusual look

Another menswear collection that made a statement was James Pilcher's monochrome range. He mixed black and white stripes and checks in over-sized coats and leggings with platform shoes the Spice Girls would have been proud of in their heyday.

Meanwhile, Danielle Ingemann's womenwear collection
 stood out thanks to her use of bright colours, quirky hats and 
feathered textures creating a range that looked wearable as well as 
unique. 

The catwalk show for the press and trade featured 33 collections by students specialising in menswear, womenswear, knitwear and millinery.

The day is an opportunity for the students to show off their imaginative flair and in the competitive world of fashion, it's no surprise they often go for outlandish designs to try and capture of the attention of industry bigwigs.
