An Albanian drug smuggler who tried to fool sniffer dogs by smearing packs of cocaine with Vicks VapoRub was jailed for 15 years yesterday.

Admir Doda, 37, was the leader of a gang who imported at least 100 kilos of cocaine into the UK for drugs barons based in the Southampton area.

The gang stashed tightly-wrapped packages of cocaine in socks before smearing the cold cure over the drugs. 

The cocaine was then driven to cities 
across the south coast, including Portsmouth, Bournemouth and 
Southampton, before being peddled on the streets.

The cartel, who are all from Albania and Kosovo, then laundered their ill-gotten gains at several bureaus de change across the capital.

But
they were arrested after detectives from Met Central Task Force’s Major
Investigation Team smashed the drug smuggling ring - one of the biggest
of its kind in recent years.

Doda and five other members of the gang were jailed for a total of 57 years and 10 months at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.

Doda, together with Aurrell Marqueshi, 33, Hysena Meta, 37, Henri Stafhansi, 30, Bledar Hyselinka, 29, and Florian Koxha, also 29, all admitted being involved in the plot.

Hyselinka was jailed for 10 years and nine months while Koxha was locked up for 10 years and two months.

Stafhansi was jailed for 10 years and
four months, Elasaf Marqueshi, who played a much lesser role, was 
jailed for five years and three months.

Meta was sentenced to six years and four months in prison. Marqueshi’s cousin Aurrell Marqueshi, 32, will be sentenced on Thursday.

Sentencing them, Judge Michael Grieve QC said: ‘You all took part in varying roles and varying levels in this conspiracy which was a plan to bring high purity cocaine to the UK.

‘The plan was carried out successfully over a total period of 22 months. Some of you were involved throughout, some for shorter periods.

‘Quite clearly this conspiracy gave rise to a Class A drug operation on a very serious scale.

‘While the prosecution assertion of upwards of 100kg of cocaine is not accepted by all defendants, all do accept it did relate to the supply of many tens of kilos and the operation is accurately described as very serious.

‘All these defendants were either born in Albania or in Kosovo of Albanian descent.

‘They formed a close knit group bound by close community ties as loyal members of this organisation.’

Addressing Doda, Judge Grieve added: ‘It’s not in dispute that you played a leading and organisational role in the conspiracy.

‘The prosecution case is that you played the leading directorial role in the UK.

‘You largely kept your distance from the drugs and cash while meeting those beneath you. You were involved in this conspiracy from start to finish.

‘As far as I can see, there is no candidate for any position above you in the UK hierarchy.’

The gang were delivering drugs to Jay Connor, 34, and Shae Flaherty, 27, who are thought to have headed a major organised crime network in the Southampton area.

Prosecutor David Aaronberg told the 
court: ‘The conspiracy concerned a plan to bring high purity cocaine 
from mainland Europe and sell it to wholesalers by the kilo.

‘The
defendants would take the Sterling they received from the sales, 
convert that into Euros, then take the currency to the suppliers in 
Europe and buy more cocaine and so continue the process indefinitely.

‘It is the crown’s case the court is concerned with at least 100 kilos of high purity cocaine.’

Once cut and sold on the street the cocaine would be worth tens of millions of pounds, said Mr Aaronberg.

Police used ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) technology to track the dealers en route to wholesalers before seizing a total of 10.5kg of the drugs after swooping on six separate occasions.

‘On some 90 occasions trips were made by one or more of the defendants to Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Southampton in order to supply cocaine to wholesalers,’ Mr Aaronberg added.

Upcoming case: Aurrell Marqueshi, pictured left, will be sentenced on Thursday while Bledar Hyselinka, pictured right was yesterday jailed for 10 years and nine months

‘Some 27 different vehicles were used during the conspiracy. Drugs or money was wrapped in cling film and brown packaging and Vicks Vapour Rub was used to disguise the smell of cocaine.

‘Packages were also placed inside socks which were hidden in vehicles in places where they were unlikely to be found.’

Most of the gang were charged by October 2012 but ‘steadfastly maintained’ their innocence and only owned up to their crimes after a jury had been sworn for their trial last week.

Doda, from Golders Green, northwest London; Aurrell Marqueshi, from Hounslow, west London; Meta, from Golders Green, northwest London; Stafansi, from Kinsbury, northwest London; Hyselinka, from Hendon northwest London; Koxha, from Richmond, Surrey; and Elasaf Marqueshi, a serving prisoner currently being held at HMP Wandsworth, all admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs between January 2011 and last November.

Connor, from Chichester, and Flaherty, from Southampton, will be sentenced at a later date.

Long term: Six members of the gang were jailed for a total of 57 years and ten months at Southwark Crown Court
