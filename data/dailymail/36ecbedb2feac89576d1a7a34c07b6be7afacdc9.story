Police are investigating the mysterious death of an 11-month-old baby boy, who died inexplicably during a nap at his daycare in Kansas City, Kansas.

Giovanni Jaraleno died Tuesday morning at Advantage Child Care - one month to the day before his first birthday.

His mother Josie Sembler said she had been planning her youngest son's birthday party. Now, she must arrange his funeral.Â

Tragic: Giovanni Jaraleno was just one month shy of his firth birthday when he was found dead inexplicably at his daycare

Giovanni was healthy and growing rapidly. He was big for his age and had no medical conditions, his mother said

Josie Sembler, Giovanni's mother, said she was planning her son's first birthday party. Now she must make funeral arrangements for him instead

Giovanni has not major health problems and was, according to his mother, a healthy baby boy. He was so healthy, in fact, that he was big for his age- wearing clothes sized for a two-year-old, KCTV reports.

Police have not said whether they suspect foul play in the boy's death or whether they are treating the case as a medical issue.

The daycare operators told police that they put the young children down for a nap Tuesday afternoon. When they got the children up, little Giovanni wouldn't move.

An ambulance was called, though doctors at the University of Kansas medical center said there was nothing they could do to revive the boy.

Ms Sembler, filled with grief, wants answers.

Tragic: Caretakers at Advantage Child Care said they put all of their children to sleep Tuesday for a nap. When they got them up, little Giovanni wouldn't wake up

Police have not said whether they are investigating foul play or if they are treating the death as a medical incident

'So many emotions. So many thoughts. Right now, we have to leave up to the police and for the investigation,' she told KCTV.

'Never imagined I would get this phone call especially on the day he turned 11 months.'

Ms Sembler says she trusts the daycare operators, but an examination of state inspections records shows some troubling violations.

KCTV reports that in March the facility was cited for not having staff trained in safe sleeping practices and prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

A state audit also found that at least five employees did not have certifications for pediatric first aid and CPR on file.
