One of two New York City Police Department officers who were critically injured in an apartment building fire over the weekend allegedly started by a 'bored' teenager has been declared brain dead.

Officer Dennis Guerra, 38, remained on life support Tuesday evening at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, where sobbing family members and his fellow cops have been keeping vigil.

Guerra's partner, 36-year-old Officer Rosa Rodriguez, remained in critical condition in Manhattan's Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she was placed in a hyperbaric chamber.

Bored firebug: Dockery, 16, admitted to police he set a mattress on fire inside the building out of boredom

The two veteran officers were overcome by smoke when they took an elevator up to the 13th floor inside an 18-story apartment complex on Surf Avenue while responding to a report of a suspicious fire at around noon Sunday.

On Monday, police arrested 16-year-old Marcell Dockery on charges of assault, arson and reckless endangerment.

Authorities said he lives in the building and set fire to a mattress that had been discarded in a hallway.

During his arrest, the suspected arsonist was seen flashing a smile for the awaiting news cameras while being led to a police cruiser.

‘We saw him smiling on TV, is this a joke? We are going through so much right now,’Guerra’s outraged mother, Miriam, told the New York Post.

Guerra, a married father of four, is an eight-year veteran of the department. Rodriguez, who also has four children, has been on the force for four years.

Dockery later revealed to detectives that boredom led him to light the mattress on fire. He was ordered held without bail.

‘I decided to take a lighter and light the top of the mattress because I was bored,’ he reportedly told police.

The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames, and when that failed, how he started knocking on neighbors’ doors to alert them to the danger, NBC New York reported.

A source told the tabloid that Dockery is a ‘firebug’ who has been bragging about his obsession with flames on his Facebook page.

Dockery has a lengthy history with the NYPD. In 2010, he was arrested for arson. His sealed record also includes criminal mischief and marijuana possession charges.  

The teen also may have been responsible for other small fires inside the Surf Avenue housing complex.

Police Commissioner William Bratton said firefighters who responded to the scene just after noon last Sunday found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor.

Emergency: Rodriguez, 36, was taken to 
Weill Cornell Medical Center, Guerra, 38, was taken to Jacobi 
Medical Center in The Bronx, before being transferred to Montefiore Medical Center

The firefighters pulled both officers back into the elevator and brought them downstairs where they were treated by EMS personnel, he said.

Before help arrived, Rodriguez was heard on radio transmission screaming, 'Can't breathe! Can't breathe! Can't see!'

The mother of four was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. On Tuesday, a relative told the New York Daily News that she was doing 'much better' and is expected to recover.

Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center.

Between them the two officers have eight children. Both officers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of smoke inhalation and remain in critical condition, Bratton said.
