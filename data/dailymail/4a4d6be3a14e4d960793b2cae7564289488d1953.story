Australia has minted its first triangular coin to mark the 25th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House.

The silver $5 coin, which costs $85 (£56), is 99.9 per cent silver. Only 10,000 coins have been minted for the celebrations.

Its reverse sports a design of the Canberra building's triangular flag mast, as seen from its courtyard.

The Royal Australian Mint has also 
produced a 20c coin made of cupro nickel. It features Parliament House with Old Parliament 
House in the foreground, which sells for $8 (£5.25) and is legal tender.

'Australian Parliament House was recognised as a major international architectural achievement when it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on this same day 25 years ago,' said Bernie Ripoll, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.

'It is fitting that the mint is demonstrating its own innovation within a minting context with Australia's first triangular coin.'

Australia is not the only country which has put triangle-shaped coins into circulation.

The coin's shape mimics the building's flag mast and has a flagpole design on its back

The Cook Islands in the South Pacific 
issued a 2002 $2 coin which had the Queen on its face and a pestle and 
mortar on the back, while Bermuda's dollar coins are known as Bermuda 
Triangles.

In 2007 the Isle of Man introduced pyramid-shaped coins to celebrate the Tutankhamun exhibition of treasures found by Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon in the Valley of the Kings from 1922.

The Isle of Man government issued commemorative triangular coins to coincide with the Tutankhamun touring exhibition at London;s O2 arena in 2007
