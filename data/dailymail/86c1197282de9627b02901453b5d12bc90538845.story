Ariel Castro's daughter who is in an Indiana prison for slashing her baby's throat has revealed that she went to school with Amanda Berry - meaning Castro used his daughters to get to know two of the three women he allegedly held captive in his house for ten years.

Emily Castro spoke out for the first time in a jailhouse interview with a private investigator on Monday. She is the last of Castro's children to condemn his alleged crimes of kidnapping, raping and beating Amanda, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight.

Also on Monday, a female officer who first broke down the door of Castro's home on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland after Amanda broke herself out last week revealed that Michelle clutched onto her and begged her not to let go when she was rescued.

Ariel Castro plans to plead not guilty to charges of kidnapping and rape of the three women

Emily Castro, 25, told private investigator Chris Giannini that she knew both Gina and Amanda before they were kidnapped, according to recordings of the interviews broadcast by Fox 8 TV in Cleveland.

Concerning her relationship with Amanda, Emily Castro said: 'I went to Wilbur Wright (Elementary School in Cleveland) with her. I seen Gina a couple times.

'It couldn't be coincidence.'

Emily Castro's younger sister Arlene says she was best friends with Gina when she was taken off a busy Cleveland street in 2004.

Anthony Castro, Ariel's son, told MailOnline last week that he fears his father targeted Gina, then 14, because of her relationship with Arlene.

According to reports, Emily Castro was in the car with her father moments before Amanda was abducted in 2003.

'It hurts so bad. I feel so used. I feel like I'm nothing to him. I'm nothing anymore,' she said.

She said her father was a master at keeping secrets, even from his own daughter. When she came to visit him after the girls were abducted, he made subtle excuses to keep her away from his captives.

'The upstairs was blocked off with the big bass speaker, so I figured that since he lived there alone so long that he didn't have any need for those four bedrooms upstairs,' she said. 

When she asked to sleep in her old bedroom, he told her no.

He said: 'It's cold up there, it's blocked off, it's dusty,' according to Emily.

Emily's Grimilda mother moved her and her three siblings out of the house in 1996 after Grimilda endured years of brutal beatings and savage control of her life.

Cleveland police officer Barbara Johnson described the harrowing experience of breaking into Castro's house and finding Michelle Knight

Emily, like her sisters and her brother before her, condemned her father for his actions.

'He's a monster. Seeing the guy that hugged us and misled with us and took us to eat and cared about us supposedly, that he is the guy that is in handcuffs...' she said.

Emily Castro is serving 25 years in an Indiana prison for slashing her 11-month-old daughter's throat in 2007. The child survived and Castro told a judge she was mentally ill and did not know what she was doing when she attacked her child.

Also on Monday, female Cleveland police officer Barbara Johnson told of how she was one of the first officers to enter the house where the three women were kept in chains for a decade.

'Michelle hugged me first, then clutched me and said, "Don't let me go,"' she said, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.

'You can't really describe how I felt...it rips the heart out of my chest.'

Another officer said he felt a sense of evil in the house when he entered it.
