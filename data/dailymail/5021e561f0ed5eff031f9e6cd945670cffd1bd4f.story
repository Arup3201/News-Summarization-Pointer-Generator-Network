A 22-year-old woman who suffered dozens of shotgun wounds when Batman shooter James Holmes opened fire in a cinema has posted a shocking photo of her injuries.

Carli Richards, was shot on her right arm, both of her legs, chest, back and rear by James Holmes, 24, during his shooting rampage at a midnight screening of the Dark Knight Rises.

Today she called for the death penalty for Holmes, saying 'I think death by firing squad would be totally justified ... Just injecting him is painless.'

Miss Richards had been in Century 16 cinema with her boyfriend Chris Townson when Holmes started the horrifying massacre in Aurora, Colorado.

'I had enough needles in me 
that night to know that a needle isn't that bad. I want him to see what 
it feels like ... I wish someone would shoot him and let him bleed out,' she told TMZ.

'He shot me with stuff they use to shoot birds and deer. I want him to feel what it's like to feel that helpless,' she added.

In a blog entry she described how she thought that when Holmes entered the screening that it was a promotional stunt.

Hospital: ' I got back to my little ER room and was told that I had gotten hit in my right arm, both of my legs, my chest, my back, and my butt,' said Miss Richard on her blog

Miss Richards had been wearing her 
father's 1980s-vintage Joker T-shirt, seated just off the left-hand 
aisle when the dark figure appeared at the front of the theater and 
tossed a gas canister.

'I think I heard a weird popping noise and then a can or something came flying towards us. The girl next to me and I both swatted at it and it almost hit me in the face, it seemed.

'In a split second, I recognized that it was tear gas, meaning that this was either a bad joke or it wasn’t a joke at all and either way, it is time to run.' 

She credits realising it was tear gas so quickly because both she and her boyfriend had trained with the U.S. navy.

'The next second is a blur but according to Chris, I jumped over him to get out of the aisle and we both ran for our lives.'

As adrenaline kicked in the pair sprinted out of the theatre and only stopped until they reached Mr Townson's car, parked about 100 yards away.

Only then did Miss Richards touch the right sleeve of her blazer and notice that it was covered with blood.

'I was still convinced that this was all a bad joke, and that it was probably fake blood or some kind of liquid from a badly done beverage toss,' she said.

'My initial reaction to it was “it’s either fake or it’s someone else’s blood”. Suddenly, the pain began to sink in.'

Miss Richards was taken to hospital in an ambulance where she was treated for her wounds.

'I got back to my little ER room and was told that I had gotten hit in my right arm, both of my legs, my chest, my back, and my butt.'

She was told that she had been hit by pellets from a shotgun.

Miss Richards wrote: 'All this meant to me was that this 
asshole really wanted to hurt and scare a lot of people. If his main 
mission was to kill, he would have gotten out the automatic weapon right
away.'

While bloody, the wounds were largely 
superficial, although she is still in pain from her injuries and is 
unable to return to work.

Yesterday Steven Hernandez, whose sister Rebecca Wingo was shot and killed, along with 11 other people during the massacre also called for the death penalty for Holmes.

On Monday Holmes was formally charged with 24 counts of murder and 116 counts of attempted murder in the shooting rampage at the midnight screening of the Dark Knight Rises on July 20.

Holmes appeared just as dazed as he did in his first court appearance last week, but at one point exchanged a few words with one of his attorneys in the packed courtroom.

Each death carried two separate murder charges, one for showing premeditation and one for showing extreme indifference to life.

Both of the charges carry the death penalty as a possible sentence.

Holmes was also charged with one count of possessing an explosive device and one count of violent crime.

The suspect faces a total of 142 criminal charges. Prosecutors have 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to seek the death penalty.
