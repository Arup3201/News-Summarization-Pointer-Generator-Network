A teacher who was bullied as a teenager because of her weight has won a competition to be the face of a supermarket's new plus-size clothing range.

Maria Garcia-Perez, 26, beat 800 hopefuls to be crowned Aldi's 'Real Model' winner to launch a new range of ladies size 14 to 24 clothing. 

 Maria was the target of bullies at school before adapting her diet and finding her 'happy weight' at around a size 16 to 18 

Maria, who entered the contest after seeing an advert at her local Aldi store, impressed the panel of judges with her body confidence and natural curves

Miss Garcia-Perez, a French and Spanish teacher from Derby, entered the competition after spotting an advert in her local Aldi store.

She was a size 20 aged 14 and found herself the target of bullies in the playground. At that time she decided she wanted to adopt a more balanced diet and dropped a couple of dress sizes.

Now a size 16 to 18, she has finally found her 'happy weight' which makes her 'feel most healthy'.

And it seems to have paid off as her body confidence and natural curves really wowed the judges, resulting in her being crowned the winner.

As part of her prize, Maria was the centre of a professional photoshoot

The contest was judged by a panel which included fashion consultant and former agent to Jerry Hall and Naomi Campbell, Jonathan Phang.

A size 20 at only age 14, Maria eventually decided to change her diet and eat more healthy foods 

As a child, Maria was a target for school bullies due to her size, which effected her self confidence 

Mr Phang said: 'Choosing Maria as our winner was a unanimous decision from the panel.

'She's a beautiful, body-confident woman who deserved the chance to become the face of Aldi's new clothing range which celebrates real women.'

Miss Garcia-Perez said: 'The other children at school would tease me about my weight, but I didn't let it bother me too much.

'At the age of 14 I was a size 20 and my clothes were getting tighter, so I decided it was time I did something about it.

'I joined a gym and I started to eat mainly salad and yoghurt. I lost 20kg (3 stone 1 pound) in four months and slimmed to a size 10.

'But I realised I wasn't happy this way, so I began to introduce carbohydrates back into my diet and have more varied meals.

'I'm now a size 16 to 18 and it's the size my body is most comfortable. I still go to the gym three times a week, I eat healthily and I'm happy with myself.

'When I saw the competition in Aldi, I just thought 'why not?'

'But I never thought I would win! I couldn't believe it when they said I'd been chosen as the winner and I'd be doing a photoshoot.

'It was incredible and I am extremely proud.

'Aldi's new range gives larger women more choice at affordable prices without compromising on quality.

'It's not all about being stick thin and being skinny doesn't necessarily mean you are healthy.'

Tony Baines, Managing Director for Corporate Buying at Aldi, said: 'There's definitely demand for good quality clothing that fits well, looks good, doesn't cost the earth and is representative of the overall population.

'Maria is the perfect real model to showcase our new size 14 to 24 ladies' clothing range.

'It offers a complete autumn/winter capsule wardrobe of stylish, quality clothing and accessories - great for women who want to look good and spend less.'

The budget supermarket's new clothing range celebrates 'real women' and hit the shelves on Sunday.

It includes cardigans, skirts, tops, tights, jeans and socks.

A pair of 'wide fit socks' cost £3.49 while the 'chunky cardigan' are £10.99 pounds. The 'jeans plus size' cost £9.99.
