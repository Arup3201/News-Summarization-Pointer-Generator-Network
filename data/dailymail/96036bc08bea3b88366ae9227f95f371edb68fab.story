An elderly man claims he has waited eight years to have a hernia operation on the NHS.

Frederick Bevan, from Swansea, was first referred for surgery in 2006 but the 77-year-old widower is still waiting for the operation to take place.

He said: ‘I know things are bad at A&Es, but eight years can’t be right.

Frederick Bevan, 77, says he has been waiting eight years for a hernia operation on the NHS

‘My life is on hold. I can’t socialise, I can’t go out and have a little dance.’

Mr Bevan agrees that fate has also played a role in the long delay.

At one stage he decided to go private but it snowed and the operation was cancelled.

Then he experienced more bad luck.

‘I agreed to go to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in 2011 but ended up in intensive care following an allergic reaction to an antibiotic so I still had the hernia,’ he said.

‘Then in October last year I went into Morriston Hospital and they told me I was having the operation. I waited three hours and they sent me home. There were no beds.’

Mr Bevan, who says he has paid 
National Insurance all his working life, has even gone to his MP Geraint
 Davies about the situation.

If left untreated some hernias can cause a bowel obstruction or cut off the blood supply to the affected tissue - both are medical emergencies.

At one point, Mr Bevan was told he would have the operation at Morriston Hospital (pictured) but he waited for three hours and was then sent home because there were no spare beds

A spokesman for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: ‘Mr Bevan was due to have undergone surgery at Morriston Hospital in October.

‘Unfortunately we sometimes have to postpone non-urgent, pre-planned operations due to emergency patients needing urgent, unplanned care.

‘Although Morriston Hospital continues to be extremely busy, we are in contact with Mr Bevan to arrange an alternative date as soon as possible.

‘We offer our sincere apologies for any inconvenience and upset caused.’

A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or tissue wall.

They can occur anywhere in the abdomen and there are several different types.

These include hernias where part of the bowel comes through the abdomen and into the groin - inguinal hernias - and hernias where tissue pokes through a surgical wound.

Inguinal hernias account for three in four cases.

About one in four men and three in 100 women will have an inguinal hernia during their lifetime.

Hernias are more common in older people, those who are obese, those who do a lot of heavy lifting and those with a long-term cough.

Some hernias cause no problems while others can cause a bowel obstruction or interrupt the blood supply to the affected tissue - both of these situations are medical emergencies.

Some hernias need to be operated on - whether surgery is required depends on the location of the hernia and what symptoms it is causing.
