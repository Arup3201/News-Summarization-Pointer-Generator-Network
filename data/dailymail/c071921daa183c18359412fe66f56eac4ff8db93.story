Frank Lampard says there is no point crying about Manchester City's form and believes Manuel Pellegrini's men can still overtake Chelsea in the race for the Barclays Premier League title.

The former England midfielder admitted that City had endured a nightmare few weeks after they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough and left seven points behind his former club in the league. 

But speaking ahead of Wednesday night's trip to the Britannia Stadium to face Stoke City, Lampard said all is not lost.

'It's been a frustrating last month for us,' the 36-year-old explained. 'We were on a really good run through December, playing every three or four days but January seems to have broken our rhythm.

'We've had fewer games, results have turned and if you don't perform and you don't win, the points situation change. There's no point crying about it - all we can do is react and start winning games.'

Defeat on Wednesday evening and victory for Jose Mourinho's seemingly-unstoppable machine over Everton at Stamford Bridge could see the gap extended to 10 points. But Lampard insists the end is not nigh.

'All teams have patches and we'll be judged at the end of the season,' he said.

City could only secure a point against Hull City in a 1-1 draw on Saturday, which means they have won just one of their last six games. 

But Lampard thinks the point at Etihad Stadium after James Milner's late equaliser might be vital come May.

'I think it was a below par performance and if you are below par then you can struggle to create chances,' he said

'Teams come to the Etihad knowing we have attacking quality. We dug a point out in the end so that was a small positive and now it's very important to get back on track.

'Sometimes you just need to wipe the slate clean, move on and we've a great opportunity to do that very quickly against Stoke.'

Lampard spent Monday night with players and staff from New York City FC. The new MLS franchise will kick off their season in March and are in Manchester on a training trip.

Last night they beat St Mirren 2-0 in their first ever competitive match.

Lampard was set to join them in January but will controversially remain at City for the remainder of the Premier League season.
