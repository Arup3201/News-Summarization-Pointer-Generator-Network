More than 100 members of three feuding gangs were arrested in Harlem for killings and gun violence on Wednesday in what was described as the largest indictment of gang members in New York City's history, authorities said.

The arrests and indictments were part of a conspiracy investigation that stemmed from the 2011 murder of Tayshana Murphy, an 18-year-old high-school basketball star, a person familiar with the investigation said.

Hundreds of New York City police officers, many heavily armed, swarmed the Manhattanville and Grant Houses in the early morning hours.

The coordinated action began at approximately 6 a.m. when teams of cops from gang divisions across the city donned helmets and carried battering rams as they simultaneously stormed several apartments

Those arrested included some of the most
 dangerous gang members accused of terrorizing residents of the housing 
complexes, according to police.

More than 400 NYPD cops flooded the 
neighboring Manhattanville and Grant Houses, near Amsterdam Avenue and 
West 125th Street around 5:30 a.m.

There were 103 arrests in the sweep, of those, 41 were already in jail on other charges, police sources said.

NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was at the 33rd Precinct station house and addressed officers before the early-morning raid, sources said.

'This is one of the biggest takedowns in NYPD history,' a police source told the New York Post.

Arrested: Many have already been indicted in a conspiracy case and are expected to be arraigned on charges that include conspiracy to commit murder

The gangs are accused of two homicides, 19 non-fatal shootings and about 50 other shooting incidents, according to a brief announcement from the Manhattan district attorney.

Further details were expected to be announced at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.

Prosecutors have said the murder of Murphy, a nationally ranked point guard nicknamed 'Chicken,' was the most widely reported casualty of an often violent feud between gangs from neighboring public apartment buildings in Harlem.

Although two young men have already been
 convicted for Murphy's murder, investigators broadened their inquiry 
into a pattern of violence they said were plaguing the neighborhood in 
upper Manhattan.

Murphy’s murder prompted authorities to tackle this years-long probe that ended in Wednesday morning’s sweep,.

Justice: Investigators say the gangs are responsible for more than 20 shootings and two murders, including the killing of Tayshana 'Chicken' Murphy in 2011

Murphy was shot three times, in her 
wrist, hip and chest, at about 4 a.m. in a hallway of her Grant Houses 
apartment building on September 11, 2011.

Her murder came after a long evening of fighting between the gangs, prosecutors said at the time.

Tyshawn
 Brockington, 24, and Robert Cartagena, 23, who were associated with a 
gang in the Manhattanville Houses project, were convicted for Murphy's 
murder and sentenced to between 25 years and life in prison.

In her honor: Prosecutors were able to link the suspects to violent acts that occurred before and after the Murphy shooting

One of them shouted, 'Happy Stack Day!' referring to his gang, the 'Staccs.'

Members of the 'Make it Happen Boyz' and 'Money Avenue' were the other groups caught up in the raid.Wednesday’s raid was led by the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau, Narcotics Division, Housing, and the Manhattan Gang Unit.

They were also joined by investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.

Wake-up call: Some of those people were taken into custody during an early morning police raid on two housing projects in Harlem

Police brought out two men the Manhattanville housing complex as Police Commissioner Bratton looked on.

'We ain't no f--king gang. I ain't in no f--king gang,' a man identified by his mother as Isaac Waterman, 20, said as police walked him in cuffs to a waiting police van.

'Y'all just f--king up my life,' he yelled.

Dozens of the charged gang members will face first-degree conspiracy counts on which they'll face a max of 25 years to life in prison.

Their arraignments are expected to begin Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court.
