Parents should take responsibility for stopping their children seeing internet pornography,  the new Culture Secretary said yesterday.

Maria Miller said the Government was considering calls to make internet companies block access to online pornography.

But the Conservative MP insisted that parents had the ‘first and foremost’ responsibility for monitoring their children’s use of the internet.

Mrs Miller added that the Government could play a role in advising parents on how to block damaging material on home computers.

The Daily Mail is campaigning for an 
automatic block on online porn unless over-18s specifically ask their 
internet service providers to let them see such material, following 
strict age verification.

On Thursday, a petition signed by 
115,000 – including 140 MPs – was handed in to Downing Street, demanding
that internet service providers block online porn.

A Government consultation on controls for online porn has now ended after receiving 2,000 responses.

It also looked at measures to protect
children from other potentially harmful websites such as those which 
promote suicide, anorexia, gambling, self-harm and violence.

In an interview Mrs Miller, a mother 
of three, said: ‘I think responsibility is very strongly with parents to
make sure that they really understand how their children are using the 
internet . . . to make sure they are safe.’

She added: ‘I think probably the 
awareness of those sorts of pieces of software you can buy or indeed 
what you can do is not as high as it needs to be.’

Last week the Archbishop of York 
warned of the ‘immeasurable misery and heartache’ caused by pornographic
sites, which make boys see girls as ‘sex objects’.

Dr John Sentamu demanded  that 
ministers ‘put children first’ by standing up to wealthy and powerful 
internet companies  which are opposing moves to protect youngsters.

Internet firms make millions from adverts for pornographic websites.

Mrs Miller, who is also the 
Government’s equalities minister, said she sympathised with parents 
worried about what children were seeing online.

‘I’ve got three children and they all
use the internet and I am as concerned as any parent about making sure 
my children are safe using the web,’ she said.

‘It’s not easy to keep up to  date with your kids’ intake of  these things.’

Her comments come as the number of 
children calling ChildLine after seeing hardcore pornography has soared 
by 34 per cent in a year, with girls reporting feeling pressured to copy
violent sexual behaviour.

The NSPCC and ChildLine have backed 
the Mail’s campaign after seeing a large increase in the number of phone
calls from children who had encountered hardcore material online.

Clear case: David Cameron said an opt-in to internet pornography would be considered

Leading neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield has warned that images of 
extreme pornography can cause long-term harm to children’s brains.

The Oxford University professor said 
the developing brain was  ‘vulnerable’ and that children needed to be 
protected from premature sexualisation.

There is growing alarm about the
impact of sexual content on the internet on Britain’s children. On 
average, children now start to use the web at the age of eight.

Research suggests as many as one in 
three under-tens has seen pornography on the web, while  four in every 
five children aged 14 to 16 admit regularly accessing explicit images 
and video footage on their home computers.

Only 3 per cent of 
pornographic  websites require proof of age  before granting access to 
sexually explicit material, and two-thirds do not even include any 
warnings of adult content.

The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport angered campaigners earlier this year by suggesting it was ruling
out the idea of an ‘on by default’ filter for porn on civil liberties 
grounds.

But following the Mail’s campaign, 
ministers have now included an option for the automatic ‘opt-in’ option 
in the consultation document.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said
there was a clear case to consider default blocks amid mounting 
concerns from child safety campaigners and MPs.
