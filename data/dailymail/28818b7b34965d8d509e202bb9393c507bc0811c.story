Families living on a tight budget already know it pays to shop at Aldi. Now they can say it tastes better too.

The discount supermarket has come out on top in an annual taste test of own-brand foods.

Aldi’s hams, spicy sauces and teas helped the chain to an overall score of 16 gold medals, beating last year’s winner Tesco into second place with 12 golds, followed by Asda which won 11.

And in a mark of its achievement, 
Aldi’s 99p pack of 40 summer berry herbal tea bags beat the best Harrods
has to offer at six times the price – a £5.95 pack of 50 green tea and 
bergamot tea bags.

Harrods failed to win a single gold.

Upmarket rivals Marks & Spencer 
scored eight golds and Waitrose won just three in The Grocer magazine’s 
food awards which all the major supermarkets enter. Products are then 
subjected to a survey of 12,000 shoppers followed by blind taste tests 
by experts.

In a year, Aldi has more than doubled
its gold count from seven in last year’s contest, while Tesco’s fell 
from 15 golds in 2012.

Thanks largely to recession-hit 
shoppers looking for bargains, the chain has become the UK’s 
fastest-growing supermarket, with sales rising more than 30 per cent a 
year.

Aldi bosses have also made a specific
effort to tempt the middle classes with ranges of upmarket 
non-essentials such as fillet steak and champagne.

Its Specially Selected range of 
top-quality products claimed a number of golds in the taste test, 
including a lemon and mascarpone cheesecake, West Country strawberry 
yogurt, and farmhouse seeded white batch loaf.

Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer, 
said: ‘Aldi’s success is no fluke. Consumers in particular now believe 
Aldi’s quality to be better than the major chains on almost every 
conceivable measure.’

Matthew Barnes, joint Aldi UK 
managing director, said: ‘We are keeping our focus very firmly on 
delivering the highest quality at the very best prices. Getting sign-off
for a product is no easy thing.’

Aldi Fruit & Herb tea costs 99p for 40 bags, while Harrods charge £5.95 for 50 bags of Green Tea with Bergamot

Aldi's latest triumph comes after the budget store were commended for their gin at the International Wine and Spirit (IWSC) awards.

Its own £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin scooped silver at the International Spirits Challenge, beating established rivals including Bombay Sapphire, selling for £21.70, and Hendricks, at £26.39, which only won bronze.

Then two weeks later their champagne was given a silver award by 
the International Wine Challenge - beating more expensive brands 
including Moet.

Judges described Aldi Champagne Veuve Monsigny as 'classy and complex'. The
leading food and wine competition said the affordable tipple offered 'an intense nose of 
baked apple, brioche and stone fruits with gorgeous flavours of apples, 
red fruit and minerality on the palate'.

The
Aldi drink was said to be better than many other reputable 
bottles, including Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 2004, which costs £130 
and £32.99 Moet and Chandon Imperial NV.
