Energy companies are refusing to hand over a £50 cut in bills promised to all households by David Cameron and George Osborne.

Five weeks ago, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £50.

However, only two of the ‘big six’ energy companies, British Gas and SSE, have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers.

Five weeks ago, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced a change to green levies which they claimed would save bill payers £50

Three companies – Scottish Power, E.on and EDF – have decided that three million customers on fixed-rate tariffs will get a reduction of just £12, or 23p a week.

Npower, which recently put up its bills by 10.4 per cent to an average of almost £1,500 a year, has yet to make an announcement.

The decisions represent a challenge to the Government’s authority and its ability to deliver on promises to consumers.

Price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com has set up an e-petition asking ministers to force firms to give the £50 cut to all.

Only two of the ¿big six¿ energy companies, British Gas and SSE, have said they will pass on the full reduction to all their customers

Spokesman Clare Francis said: ‘While the Government announcement was an attempt to help  struggling households cope with the rising cost of their energy bills, the silence from some suppliers has been deafening. 

‘British Gas and SSE have done the right thing and said all customers will benefit from the reduced cost of levies, and British Gas has already introduced its lower prices.

‘We ask the Government to challenge the other energy providers to play fair and help households by passing on the full reduction to all customers. People are fed up with this smoke-and-mirrors mentality from energy firms.’

At the beginning of December, George Osborne said: ‘There’s going to be an average of £50 off people’s bills.

‘We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’ 

Subsequently, a spokesman for the Energy Secretary, Ed Davey, said: ‘We have announced a package that should lead to all households seeing an average saving of around £50 a year. 

‘There is no practical bar to these savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £50 discount.’

Scottish Power said yesterday that its variable-tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from January 12

However, this has not happened. Fixed-tariff customers with E.on, EDF and Scottish Power are only getting a reduction of £12, while npower remains silent on the bills issue.

Scottish Power said yesterday that its variable-tariff customers will receive a 3.3 per cent cut from January 12, bringing the average bill down to £1,284.

It confirmed that around one million fixed-rate customers will only get £12 off.

The Spanish-owned firm said that most people on fixed rates are already paying less than those with variable tariffs, and so it is not  necessary to give them the full £50 cut.

This is at odds with the policy of British Gas, SSE and Government ministers.

A spokesman for Scottish Power said: ‘At present, 97 per cent of customers on fixed-price products already have a lower bill value than these new standard tariffs. 

‘These customers were protected from the rising cost of green levies as they were not impacted by our recent price rise.’ 

Audrey Gallacher, head of energy at the customer body Consumer Futures, said: ‘The message has been that people were going to save £50 on their energy bill, but it seems a fair chunk of people will not get that.

'The right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board. That is the expectation that the Government has created.’ 

Ann Robinson, of comparison website uSwitch.com, said: ‘The whole intent of the Government’s proposals was to give people much-needed relief. I feel very strongly that everyone should benefit.’
