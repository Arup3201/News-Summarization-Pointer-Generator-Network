It is not every day you drive 120 miles without noticing a sleeping cat inside the dashboard.

But bus driver Simon Mitchell did just that - mistaking the animal's soft purring noise for the engine.

It was only after Mr Mitchell stripped the panels from the vehicle that he found the stowaway kitten sleeping peacefully.

Simon Mitchell found the kitten in his dashboard after driving 120 miles

Mr Mitchell had spent the day driving the bus on his 120-mile standard route across Chulmleigh, Devon to neighbouring towns on October 11.

After several passengers had reported hearing a strange noise, Mr Mitchell stopped several times and searched under all the seats - but to no avail.

He looked inside the engine - thinking the purring sound was perhaps coming from there - but still couldn't find its source.

He returned to his depot after his five-hour round trip and as a last resort started to remove the vehicle's panels.

Mr Mitchell, of Turner's Tours, eventually found the problem when he removed the dashboard panel.

He said: 'When cars pass you they make a whooshing noise and it sounded like a miaow. I thought I was going mental.

'I stopped several times to look around the bus but I couldn't find anything.

'Every time I stopped the kitten stopped making a noise. I couldn't tell where it was coming from, but it had quite a voice.

A stroke of Luck: Driver Simon Mitchell strokes Lucky the cat

Mr Mitchell started taking the panels off the bus when he got it back to the depot in a bid to find the noise

'I was pleased I found it, because it proved I wasn't going mad.'

Sorry, I'm in a dash: Driver Simon Mitchell with stowaway kitten Lucky beside the front of the bus he had to take apart

He said in the morning he had found two kittens had jumped onto the bus overnight but they had run off and he thinks the third was part of the same litter.

Pip Gilson, who works in the Turner's Tours office, has now adopted the kitten - and called him Lucky.

She said: 'We couldn't believe he'd been trundling around all day. He's OK now. He was actually feral and bit and scratched me, but he's calmed down a bit.

'There are a couple of feral cats that live around the depot, and we think his mum must have taken Lucky and the other kittens into the bus to keep dry.

'The driver had left the door open on the bus so they must have got in there. And in the morning the drivers coming in must have scared them and they rushed off.

'But Lucky must have gone the wrong way and somehow ended up in the dash.'

Lucky seemed none the worse for the ordeal.
