Google was accused of trying to avoid British justice yesterday after it claimed that UK courts had no jurisdiction to put it on trial for privacy breaches.

The search engine is accused of bypassing security settings on Apple iPhones, iPads and computers to track users’ web browsing without their knowledge and send them targeted advertisements.

A group of British internet users has launched legal action against the firm for breach of privacy.

Google appealed to the High Court to have the case thrown out claiming action should have been taken in America where its headquarters are. The company's New York office is pictured

But yesterday Google appealed to London’s High Court to throw out the case, arguing that the British claimants should have launched their action in the United States as that’s where the firm is based. 

Its headquarters are based in Silicon Valley, California, although it also has three offices in London and one in Manchester.

The move, branded ‘arrogant’ by the claimants, will fuel anger over Google’s attempts to avoid regulation in overseas markets.

The company already avoids hundreds of millions of pounds in corporation tax by legally booking UK profits through its European headquarters in Dublin.

Antony White QC, acting on behalf of Google, told the court on the first
day of a two-day hearing: ‘It’s not enough to say ‘the claimants are 
here and they would like to sue here’.

‘It’s not a starting point
where the claimants are, or where the claimants have their computers, 
or that they suffered their distress here.

‘The defendants are there (in the US), its witnesses are there, its documents are there.’

But speaking outside the court, a spokesman for the claimants Jonathan 
Hawker, said: ‘Why should ordinary British people have to travel to 
California to seek justice?

'Google breached British people’s privacy in Britain. It has offices in the UK, it employs staff in the UK, and it makes a lot of money in the UK.

‘Clearly, if it operates here and makes a profit here, it should answer 
to English law, but it wants to act in whichever way it wants, wherever 
it wants.

‘This is a point of principle for us because we believe you should abide by English law, no matter how big you are.

'It should answer to English law, but it wants to act in whichever way it wants, wherever it wants.’

‘Google has more than enough resources to fly its documents and its witnesses over here.’

The test claim is being brought by British internet users 
Judith Vidal-Hall, former editor of Index On Censorship magazine, Robert
Hann, director of an IT security company, and Marc Bradshaw, director 
of an IT services company – part of a group called Safari Users Against 
Google’s Secret Tracking.

Apple’s search browser Safari was designed to block software that allowed Google to track what users were looking at online.

But
between summer 2011 and spring 2012, Google disabled this safeguard and
monitored people’s internet surfing habits without their knowledge.

Claimants allege the company bypassed security settings on iPhones to track their web browsing habits

Google
has already paid out a total of £24.2million to US states and the US 
Federal Trade Commission for the same privacy breach.

The 
claimants argue that Google acted directly contrary to a 2009 amendment 
to a EU Directive which required consent before an internet user’s 
device could be tracked for behavioural advertising.

They say the
company was able to collate a wealth of information on users, from 
their their shopping habits to more personal details about their 
physical and sexual health, political affiliations, union membership, 
financial situation and sexual interests.

It then targeted them with advertisements based on the websites they had visited, causing them ‘embarrassment and distress’.

Mr White claimed the information obtained was ‘not personal’, so Google had no obligation to keep it confidential.

But he appeared to admit that its targeted advertisements were irritating.

He told the court: ‘If you have a car parked on your driveway you might get a flier through for a local garage.

‘It’s irritating, it’s unwanted and it is unsolicited but does it cross that threshold, my submission is that it doesn’t.

‘Another example is in my inbox I get unsolicited emails every day.

‘There might technically be a European court action to stop that but you cannot claim damages just because of that.’ 

He
said he anticipated any damages awarded at the end of proceedings would
be ‘very modest’ and said the nature of the allegations suggested any 
breach of privacy had been ‘a nuisance’, rather than serious.

But
the claimants’ barrister Mr Hugh Tomlinson QC dismissed the comparison 
to junk mail, saying: ‘We say there are very serious and important 
issues which relate to how Google, a corporation of immense wealth and 
power, deals with private information and the individuals who use their 
services.

‘We wholly reject the idea these are trivial and 
uninteresting claims sounding in trivial sums and the court should not 
entertain them.’ 

The claimants’ solicitor Dan Tench, said: ‘Google 
has a history of making it difficult for people to take legal action 
against them.

‘They may be hoping the claimants will drop the case if is heard in America.

‘Or they may be hoping they will be treated more favourably in America, even if they were tried under English law.’ 

Google
pointed to a similar US case launched by members of the public. It was 
shut down in October when a judge said users had not come to any harm 
even if they were tracked.

A spokesman said: ‘We’re asking the 
court to re-examine whether this case meets the standards required in 
the UK for a case like this to go to trial.’ 

The proceedings were heard before Mr Justice Tugendhat, sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice’s Queen’s Bench Division.

The hearing concludes today.
