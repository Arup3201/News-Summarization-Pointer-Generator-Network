Garry Hancock (pictured with the packet of mushrooms) complained to Walsh Mushrooms after his wife found a cigarette in the packet

A father-of-four was left disgusted after his wife discovered a cigarette inside a packet of mushrooms.

Garry Hanock, 36, said his wife Alexandra, 36, had been preparing dinner for their four sons when she spotted the unsmoked cigarette in the packet of mushrooms.

When Mr Hancock, from Peasedown St John, near Bath, Somerset, complained to the company who supplied the mushrooms he received a cheque for 92p reimbursing him and an offer of a factory visit.

He said: 'Whether the cigarette was put in the mushrooms on purpose by some disgruntled member of staff or whether it was an accident we’ll never know but packets should be checked much more carefully before they end up on the shelves.

'I was shocked with the response of the company who supplied the mushrooms.

'They sent me a cheque for 92p which was how much the mushrooms cost and invited me to visit the factory where the mushrooms are packed.

'I have to say I rang them up and suggested they would be better off inviting someone from the Food Standards Agency to look around instead of me.'

Mr Hancock, a printer, bought the packet of British mushrooms from a Co-operative shop in Radstock, Somerset, on January 14.

The mushrooms were supplied to the store from Walsh Mushrooms in Evesham, Worcestershire.

Brian Cartwright, sales and marketing director, said it was the first such incident in the 35 years the company has been in business.

He said: 'The packet was harvested in Northern Ireland at one of our growers.

'We have very strict rules and regulations about taking anything into the work place, let alone cigarettes.

'We have followed that through with the site and the site operator has had all his people together and let them know this has been found and reminded them that people could lose their jobs if they break the rules about bringing items into the work place.

'If anyone was found to have done this they would be prosecuted.

'We are very disappointed that he (Mr Hancock) has turned down our offers.'
