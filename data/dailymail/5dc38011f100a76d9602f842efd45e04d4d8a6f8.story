An enterprising blogger has transcribed, recorded, and uploaded a musical score she discovered discreetly written on the butt of a figure in Garden Of Earthly Delights, the famous painting by Hieronymus Bosch.

The painting, which dates from between 1490 and 1510, is a religious-themed triptych - in three parts - which in its right-hand panel depicts hell.

Amelia Hamrick, who attends Oklahoma Christian University, first learned about the painting in a humanities class last year, and fascinated by it had taken to looking at it from time to time.

‘It's kind of like a 500-year-old “Where's Waldo,'” she told The Oklahoman.

After viewing the painting again with her friend Luke last Tuesday, they noticed that one of the suffers in the hell scene had musical notes branded on their backside and decided to find out what the butt song from hell might actually sounded like.

Hamrick spent a half-hour transcribing it into modern notation, and then posted the recording on her blog where it began to get a lot of traffic; probably because of the unofficial name she gave the 27-second piece of music.

‘I feel like The 500-Year-Old Butt Song From Hell is a pretty funny name, but it's not the most academic,’ she said. ‘That's literally what it is, but in retrospect, I probably should have chosen a little more dignified of a name.’

The Garden Of Earthly Delights, the famous painting by Hieronymus Bosch, dates from between 1490 and 1510, and is a religious-themed triptych

The Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title given to a triptych painted by the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch.

It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1939.

Dating from between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between about 40 and 60 years old, it is his best-known and most ambitious complete work.

The three scenes of the inner triptych are probably intended to be read chronologically from left to right.

The left panel depicts God presenting Eve to Adam, the central panel is a broad panorama of socially engaged nude figures, fantastical animals, oversized fruit and hybrid stone formations. The right panel is a hellscape and portrays the torments of damnation.

The poor, musically-branded soul can be found in the bottom left-hand corner of the painting’s third and final panel, wherein Bosch depicts the various torture methods of hell.

The unfortunate hell-dweller lies prostrate atop an open music book, crushed by a gigantic lute, while a toad-like demon stretches his tongue towards his tuneful buttocks.

After unlocking one 500-year-old musical mystery, Hamrick has started looking for other pieces of hidden music in Bosch's paintings.

Next she plans to transcribe the book with sheet music in it actually located in the same painting right next to the musical rear end.
