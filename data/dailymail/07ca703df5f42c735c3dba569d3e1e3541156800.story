Tragic: Ronni Chasen, 64, was shot dead in her car as she drove home through Beverly Hills

Leading Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was murdered with a gun stolen from a cop, the police have revealed today as they closed the investigation into the death, which stunned Los Angeles.

Police said that Ms Chasen, 64, was killed after one of the four bullets to hit her exited her body and then hit her again. It is believed that she was a victim of an attempted robbery or road rage.

A state of fear swept the city after Ms Chasen was shot dead on Sunset Boulevard on November 15 while driving home from a premiere party for the movie ‘Burlesque’.

Rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen has been targeted in a professional hit.

But a law enforcement officer who has seen the final police report, which is expected to be released today, has revealed that the crime scene was consistent with an altercation such as an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasen’s car was found with its window open a few inches.

Police believe that Harold Smith, a 43-year-old ex-con, shot Ms Chasen.

Smith shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers.

The report revealed that the gun, 
which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police 
officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley.

Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her

Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard

Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges

It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen.

The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen has been killed in a professional hit.

It
said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon 
and the hit would likely have been in a more remote location.

The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern.

Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ‘normal life’.

The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 1 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole.

Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera.

She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred.

The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry.

She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita.

She also did work for the Cocoon and Rocky franchises as well as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.

She was named senior vice president of worldwide publicity at MGM in 1993.

MGM
executive Ashley Boone called Ms Chasen, 'One of the most respected 
publicity executives in the business' with 'strength and expertise in 
developing, positioning and executing productive motion picture 
campaigns'.
