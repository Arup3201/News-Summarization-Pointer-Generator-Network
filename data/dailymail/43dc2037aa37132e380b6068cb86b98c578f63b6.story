David Strettle urged England to show greater consistency with their wing selections after advancing his own case for a recall with two more tries on Saturday.

The 31-year-old demonstrated his finishing class as Saracens claimed a stirring 30-23 victory over Clermont Auvergne in Pool One of the European Champions Cup at Allianz Park.

Despite his latest feat, Strettle is unlikely to feature in the England squad named on Wednesday and he expressed concerns about the selection policy out wide.

Chris Ashton also registered a brace of tries as he looks to cement a spot in Stuart Lancaster's squad 

'So many wings come and go with England because Test rugby is a bigger game. You have to have more of an all-round game,' he said. 

'The sad thing is you get young lads who come in and score tries for their clubs, get put in at the highest level and get exposed then people just get rid of them.

'They've shown some natural talent in being a good finisher, so teach them the game and stick with them. That doesn't seem to happen on the wing.

'If they're scoring tries in the Premiership and not scoring for England — but they go back to the Premiership and keep scoring tries — maybe it's because they're not getting the same ball.

Explosive Bath winger Semesa Rokoduguni has been tipped to win his first England cap in November 

'Lads are usually blooded a lot younger on the wing and there needs to be more onus on sticking with them and teaching them a bigger skill base.

'I'm one of the best wings in England and have been playing consistently at this level for a number of seasons. Stuart (Lancaster) has done the right thing. He's had a look at the wings out there and I hope that leading up to the World Cup he'll pick the best ones.'

Chris Ashton also scored two tries in Saracens' win and is destined to be included in the England squad, along with Marland Yarde and one or both of the Bath pair, Anthony Watson and Semesa Rokoduguni. Jonny May of Gloucester and Wasps' Christian Wade are also in the mix.

In Saturday's other Pool One match, Sale stormed into a 23-7 half-time lead at home to Munster, but the visitors rallied with two tries after half-time and snatched a 27-26 win courtesy of Ian Keatley's injury-time drop goal.

Dan Biggar was in superb form for the Ospreys as the Welsh region cruised a 42-7 victory against Treviso 

Wales star Dan Biggar wants the Ospreys to travel 'full of confidence' when they tackle English champions Northampton at Franklin's Gardens next Saturday.

Fly-half Biggar kicked 17 points and ran the show as Ospreys opened their European Champions Cup campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a 42-7 bonus-point victory over outclassed Treviso at the Liberty Stadium.

It meant the unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Pool Five, teeing up the Saints clash after clinching a seventh successive win in all competitions.

Biggar said: 'We realise how difficult a place it is going to be to play at next week, but also we should go up there with confidence. Why not?

'We are unbeaten this season at the minute. We are under no illusions that there is loads to work on, but why not go up there full of confidence and give it a good go?'

Northampton lock Courtney Lawes rises high to claim a lineout but his side went down 20-11 in Paris 

Northampton endured an agonising end to their Pool Five match against Racing Metro in Paris. 

With time almost up, Ben Foden had a kick charged down on his 22 by Marc Andreu, who ran on to score. Johannes Goosen added the extras to deny Saints a losing bonus point in a 20-11 victory.

Bath's return to Europe's top table began in disastrous fashion as they were crushed 37-10 by Glasgow at Scotstoun — conceding five tries. 

The visitors also lost Kyle Eastmond to injury to cap a bad week for after they missed out on signing Steffon Armitage.
