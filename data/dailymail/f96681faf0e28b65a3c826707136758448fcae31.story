Hard work: Kaylan Ouerbacker wanted to be an Eagle Scout ever since he was five-years-old

KEYT.com reports that Kaylan wanted to be an Eagle Scout ever since he was five years old and had a little help from his father who serves as the scout master.

In order to become an Eagle Scout members of the troop must exhibit their leadership skills.

'To earn the rank of Eagle, a Scout must prior to reaching their 18th birthday, earn a total of 21 Merit Badges of which 10 are required, provide leadership to their unit for six months after earning their Life Rank, and plan, develop, and give leadership that benefits a religious institution, a school, or a community organization,' the troop's website states.

The rank of Eagle Scout is difficult to gain but perhaps that's why so many successful members of society have made it that far.

CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, astronaut and the first man to walk on the moon Neil Armstrong, President Gerald Ford, director Steven Spielberg and actor Jimmy Stewart,reports KEYT.com.
