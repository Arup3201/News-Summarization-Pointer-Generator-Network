Ryan Taylor has spent the past two years on treatment tables, in swimming pools, on weights and running machines, even in the stands scouting.

The one place he hasn’t been is a Premier League football pitch. In fact, not since August 25, 2012, has his name appeared on a top-flight teamsheet.

Later that week, in a Europa League match, Taylor suffered a cruciate ligament injury. It happens. He did his rehabilitation and returned towards the end of the season.

But before his anticipated comeback match, Taylor was struck down in training with exactly the same injury. This time, though, the prognosis was not good – a year minimum on the sidelines.

On Sunday, some 26 months on from the initial damage, Taylor is expected to take his place on the Newcastle bench at Spurs.

His return is said to have provided even more of a boost to the squad than their first win of the season against Leicester last weekend.

For Taylor, a cheeky Scouser who scored the decisive goal in a Tyne-Wear derby in 2011, is a popular character. His team-mates have worn ‘Ryan Taylor – Over the Wall’ t-shirts in support of their stricken comrade, the design referencing the song dedicated to his free-kick winner against Sunderland.

And his manager, Alan Pardew, says the 30-year-old’s return has lifted his camp.

‘Ryan’s return is the story to come out of our training ground this week in my opinion,’ he said.

‘I think it’s an inspirational story to everybody here and everybody in football, because this is a guy who has had terrible, terrible luck with cruciate injuries and he has come back again.

‘It was so pleasing to put his name on the teamsheet this week to travel. That's good news for us, because he is a very, very liked guy here.

Pardew is pleased to have Taylor back in and around his squad following his return to fitness

‘He commands great respect, not just with our fans, but within the training ground, his place of work.

‘For our coaches and our players, we know how unfortunate he has been but he still comes in with a positive smile on his face and does his rehab - can you imagine doing that three times?’

That third occasion mentioned by Pardew was a horrific double leg break which Taylor suffered playing for Wigan’s reserves – ironically, at Newcastle – in 2006.

Those injuries have limited the 30-year-old to just 103 Premier League appearances since signing for the Latics from Tranmere in 2005.

But Taylor has tried to earn his keep at Newcastle during the past couple of years by scouting opposition teams. Indeed, his detailed dossiers boasted an unbeaten run when he first took on the role of super scout, and Pardew was more than happy to let Taylor offer guidance to individual players.

And the United boss added: ‘He's just a good person to have at the training ground. There's been a lot of talk this week about professionalism at training grounds and what people bring.

‘What Ryan brings is a real good knowledge and a good understanding, and also professionalism that can inspire others.’

Meanwhile, owner Mike Ashley was spotted at White Hart Lane during Spurs’ 5-1 victory over Asteras in the Europa League on Thursday.

Could he, then, be about to take on Taylor’s duty of opposition scout?

‘Yes, maybe he is,’ laughed Pardew. ‘I hope so.’
