Dutch architects have designed a fascinating concept hotel that would be the jewel of any large city.

The proposed Amethyst Hotel is shaped like a geode and features a facade that has the appearance of violet-coloured crystals in volcanic rock.

Amsterdam-based NL Architects is envisioning a chain of striking hotel towers with designs based on the ‘positive powers’ of amethyst, a variety of quartz used in jewellery.

It is hoped that the luxury hotels would be situated in stunning locations around the world, with the first planned for China’s Ocean Flower, a man-made island currently under development in the sea north of Hainan.

The hotel rooms are centred on a large void, providing plenty of natural light for guests, and a circular corridor connects all the rooms. 

NL Architects said a sliced amethyst geode is often referred to as a ‘cathedral’, a reference celebrated in the hotel in which ‘a particularly uplifting space comes into being’.

A spokesperson for NL Architects said: ‘A large number of miraculous powers are attributed to the amethyst in all sorts of cultures. It was said to bring good fortune in war and in the hunt, protect crops against tempests and locusts, drive out evil spirits and inspire the intellect.' 

NL Architects said it was inspired by amethyst as it 'calms and cools excessive emotions and eases the transition to a more meditative state'

Hotel rooms would be situated on an atrium and they would be linked by circular corridors around the perimeter

Amethyst is said to strengthen the immune system and help heal imbalances of the respiratory tract and skin, said NL Architects

The spokesperson added: ‘Amethyst has the capacity to purify any space of negative vibrations. It calms and cools excessive emotions and eases the transition to a more meditative state by clearing the unnecessary mind clutter.

‘The power effects include the capacity to combat addictive problems, prevent nightmares and other healing properties.’
