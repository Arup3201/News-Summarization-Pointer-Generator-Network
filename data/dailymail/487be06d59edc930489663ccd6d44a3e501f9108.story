One in ten inspectors working for the NHS watchdog was hired despite not being up to the job.

The Care Quality Commission has admitted that 126 of its staff were recruited through a ‘flawed’ process.

They were taken on during a major recruitment drive in 2012 prompted by accusations that the watchdog was failing in its duty to carry out rigorous checks of hospitals and care homes.

But the CQC has since discovered that during those 12 months the pass rate was lowered and candidates were hired despite under-performing in key assessments.

The flaw only came to light in March during a review of the recruitment process, which was prompted by the concerns of other staff. But the watchdog says it cannot sack the inspectors in case they sue for unfair dismissal.

The disclosure is the latest blow for the CQC, which has been dogged by scandal since it was set up in 2009 to inspect hospitals, care homes and GP services.

The poor recruitment was uncovered by the Health Service Journal, which obtained the review of the process under Freedom of Information laws. It states that during 2012 a total of 134 candidates were appointed as inspectors even though they were subsequently found not to have met certain ‘benchmarks’.

A total of 126 remain among the 1,031 full-time inspectors, for whom the starting salary is £38,000.

The document adds that throughout 2012, there was a ‘flawed recruitment process’ that resulted in a ‘lowering of the passrate’ of certain assessments.

It involved a single assessment day that led to ‘a significant number of people in post who were not recruited to the required standard’. The review admitted that staff were appointed without ‘the core competencies to do the job properly’.

The CQC says it cannot get rid of these inspectors as they were unaware of the flawed recruitment process and so could sue for unfair dismissal.

It is drastically trying to overhaul its reputation and in 2012 appointed a new chief executive and chairman. They replaced Cynthia Bower and Jo Finney, who were accused of conspiring to cover-up a botched inspection of a maternity unit at Furness General hospital, where poor care contributed to the deaths of mothers and babies.

Rebecca Prideaux, a former inspector who resigned last year after repeatedly raising concerns over staff to senior managers at the CQC, told the Mail that there were still people ‘at risk’ in the healthcare sector.

‘The CQC keeps promising that it has changed but this shows it is still putting the public at risk.

‘To have 126 inspectors who are in charge of regulating hospitals and care homes who do not meet basic standards is shocking. This means staff who won’t be able to identify risks to patients and care home residents, who don’t have experience of the sector, who are simply substandard.

‘The only way it’s ever going to work is if Jeremy Hunt abolishes it and starts again.’

CQC chief executive David Behan said the recruitment process was now much more rigorous and took place over five days. ‘We now recruit people with specialist experience in healthcare, primary medical services and adult social care.

‘All of our inspection staff, regardless of when they were appointed, receive training, are subject to regular performance management reviews, and their work is quality assured.’
