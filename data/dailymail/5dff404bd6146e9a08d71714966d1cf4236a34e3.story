He had only just moved back in with his fiancée in a bid to rekindle their relationship.

But now, boxing legend Ricky Hatton has reportedly moved out of his £3million family home for a second time.

The former two-weight world champion allegedly had a bust-up with Jennifer Dooley during a holiday in Tenerife with their children, Millie, two, and ten-month-old Fearne.

Bust-up: Ricky Hatton allegedly had a bust-up with his fiancée Jennifer Dooley during a holiday in Tenerife

He had flown to Lanzarote to watch a boxing fight, but 'went off the radar' after going out for a drink, a source told Richard Moriarty of The Sun. 

He eventually showed up at the family mansion in Hyde, Greater Manchester, two days later, where he was greeted by his 'furious' fiancée.

'Jennifer stood at the airport desperately ringing his mobile,' said the unnnamed source. 'She was humiliated and furious.'

Last month, Hatton, 35, who received an MBE in 2010, returned to the family home after moving out last December following a row with Miss Dooley.

In January, he spoke about his desire to save his engagement, telling the Manchester Evening News: 'Me and Jennifer are working through our difficulties.

'We are no different to anybody else except my life is under the spotlight because of who I am.'

After moving out for a second time, Hatton is reportedly now living in a £150,000 semi-detached house in Hyde.

The apparent distance between the couple is a stark contrast to four years ago, when Miss Dooley was pictured screaming from the front row as her fiancé lay unconscious in the ring.

Her face could be seen contorting with grief as Hatton was floored for the third time by his Filipino opponent Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2009.

She then endured an agonising three minutes as the star, dubbed The Hitman, lay out cold on the canvas before eventually being revived.

MailOnline has contacted Hatton's representatives for comment.
