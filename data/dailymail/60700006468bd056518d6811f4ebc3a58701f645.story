Life after Luis Suarez got off to a stuttering start for Liverpool as they were made to work hard by Southampton at Anfield, before emerging victorious.

Saints, who had sold three of their stars to Brendan Rodgers' side this summer, put up a strong fight, coming from behind with Nathaniel Clyne cancelling out Raheem Sterling's opener. But Daniel Sturridge struck from close range late on to give the hosts a winning start to the season.

Sportsmail's Dominic King gives his opinion on the performances from both sets of players.

Opener: Raheem Sterling celebrates putting Liverpoool 1-0 up after a sumptuous ball from Jordan Henderson

Back on terms: Clyne smashes Southampton level giving Ronald Koeman hope of a point in his first game

Winner: England striker Daniel Sturridge pokes home Liverpool's second goal from close range

Liverpool  (4-2-3-1)

Simon Mignolet – A couple of smart stops in the first half and, like last season, came to Liverpool’s rescue late on with a fabulous finger-tip stop to thwart Schneiderlin – 7.5

Javier Manquillo – Made a few thumping challenges and showed a willingness to defend. Encouraging Premier League debut from the Spaniard, who will improve with games – 7

Martin Skrtel – Played with experience and composure. Looking to form a solid partnership with Lovren, couldn’t get to Clyne with a last ditch tackle when Southampton equalised – 7

Dejan Lovren – Given an acerbic reception by his old supporters but never paid any attention; a couple of robust challenges and some excellent long passing made this an impressive debut – 7

Saving the day: Mignolet had to be at his best to deny Southampton, tipping one strike brilliantly onto the bar

Well-know opponent: Lovren was making his Liverpool debut against his former club

Glen Johnson – Facing a fight to maintain his position as a regular starter; made one crucial block to deny Ward-Prowse a certain goal but looked uncomfortable on the left flank – 5.5

Steven Gerrard – Steady without being spectacular from the captain, never wasted a pass and had more of an influence when Lucas was replaced by Allen – 7

Lucas – Chosen ahead of Emre Can for his experience but saw his afternoon end prematurely when replaced by Joe Allen after failing to exert a significant influence – 5

Jordan Henderson – Played the pass of the match to set Sterling scampering away for Liverpool’s opening goal; his usual honest, energetic performance – 7

Philippe Coutinho – A Brazilian with a number of gifts but this was an afternoon when he spent too long on the periphery, failing to provide any kind of service for Sturridge – 5 

Encouraging: Coutinho (left) showed few flashes of his quality, never really unlocking the Southampton defence

Raheem Sterling – Took his goal with great style and threatened to give Southampton nightmares with his speed on the counter; came up with the crucial head on to provide the winner for Sturridge – 8.5

Daniel Sturridge – Got involved early, with a shot that fizzed wide and a shout for a penalty, but then disappeared from view for long spells, until popping up when it mattered – 6.5  

Southampton (4-2-3-1)

Fraser Forster – Powerless to prevent either of Liverpool’s goals but wasn’t overly-worked on his Premier League debut. Didn’t have to make a save of note – 6.5 

Solid: Forster, who could do little about either Liverpool goal, beats away a shot from Sterling

Nathaniel Clyne – Full of invention and energy, took his goal with the confidence and swagger of someone with much more experience. Will be pushing for an England call on this evidence – 7

Jose Fonte – Didn’t have his normal partner to back him up but made no difference; he carried on tackling and controlling Southampton’s defence, impressed with some hefty late challenges – 7.5

Maya Yoshida – Perhaps lucky to get away with a silly tackle on Sturridge in the first half but, otherwise, wasn’t given a difficult afternoon by Sturridge – 6.5 

New Saint: Ryan Bertrand was one of eight new signings to make their debut at Anfield

On target: Clyne smashed home after bursting into the Liverpool box to draw Saints level

Ryan Bertrand – Honest and hard-working, he covered miles down the left flank. Couldn’t cut out the cross that ultimately led to Liverpool’s late winner – 7

Victor Wanyama – Protected Southampton’s defence with great diligence, caused problems for Liverpool with his muscular aggression when he powered forward. Didn’t deserve to be on the losing side – 7.5

Morgan Schneiderlin – No doubting his commitment to Southampton here; tackled relentlessly, covered miles and was desperately unlucky late on not to secure Southampton a point – 8

Steven Davis – Will spend the next week running over the chance he fluffed in front of The Kop to give Southampton what would have been a crucial lead. His face told the story – 6 

Prolific: Vincent Wanyama made more successful tackles in the first half than the whole Liverpool team

James Ward-Prowse – Superb afternoon from the England Under-21 international, full of energy and invention. A number of fine set piece deliveries and kept running into dangerous areas – 8

Dusan Tadic – Southampton look to have bought well, as he caused Liverpoolo trouble all afternoon and provided a magnificent back heel pass to Clyne. Standing ovation from away fans when he was substituted – 8

Graziano Pelle – Struggled to make any kind of impression and was kept under a tight-rein by Lovren and Skrtel. Didn’t have any chance to cause problems – 5 

Good start: Dusan Tadic impressed on debut for Southampton, laying on a goal for Clyne with a lovely touch
