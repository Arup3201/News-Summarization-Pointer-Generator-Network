A 29-year-old Hawaii man sparked terror on a Japan Airlines flight after  sexually assaulting a female passenger in the plane's bathroom, the FBI have said. 

Michael Tanouye, who was travelling with his mother, allegedly forced his way into the restroom an hour and 45 minutes after the flight to Kansai, Japan, took off from Honolulu International Airport

He then tried to take the Japanese passenger's clothes off, before exposing himself, it is said. While struggling with Tanouye, the unnamed woman managed to push an emergency button.

However, she remained trapped with him for a few minutes as the flight crew, other passengers and her panicked mother tried to open the bathroom door, which the suspect was allegedly blocking.

Arrest: Michael Tanouye (pictured), 29, sexually assaulted a female passenger in the bathroom of a Japan Airlines plane, the FBI have said. Tanouye's actions forced the plane, from Hawaii to Japan, to turn around

The group finally managed to unscrew the door's hinges, rescue the woman and subdue Tanouye, who lives in Hilo, according to Hawaii News Now.

Following the incident last Saturday, the captain was forced to abandon the plane's journey to Kansai International Airport, and instead returned to Honolulu.

The condition of the woman, who was returning home  after a four-day vacation with her mother, remains unknown. However, a male passenger was reportedly injured trying to subdue Tanouye.

Upon arrival in Honolulu, Tanouye was arrested by FBI agents and charged with interfering with a flight crew and aggravated sexual assault on board an aircraft.

The sexual assault charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. 

Before the alleged attack, Tanouye was heard shouting words that were incomprehensible, FBI Special Agent Necosie Wilson wrote in an affidavit.

Return: The captain of the plane reportedly made the decision to return to Honolulu International Airport (pictured) two hours into the flight after hearing that it took three passengers to keep Tanouye calm

His mother reportedly told a flight attendant he suffered from depression and was on medication, while Tanouye stood up and walked around the plane 'calmly'.

Flight attendants agreed not to serve him alcohol because he was on medication. After the incident, Tanouye's mother gave him a dose of his medicine and he fell asleep, the affidavit said.

The captain of the plane reportedly made the decision to turn around two hours into the flight after hearing that it took three passengers to keep Tanouye calm following the alleged assault.

Tanouye, who is being held without bail at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center, appeared in federal court for a brief hearing yesterday, seemingly sporting an injury on the left side of his face.

He replied 'yes' when the judge asked if he understood the charges. He did not  enter a plea.

Defense attorney Richard Sing declined to comment after the hearing, while Tanouye's parents and sister attended the hearing and left the courthouse without commenting.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Larry Butrick told U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Chang there are additional charges and 'mental health issues at play'.

 Outside the courtroom, Butrick declined to elaborate on the pending charges, mental health issues or the suspect's facial injury.
