Five gang members have pleaded guilty to murder and weapons charges after a girl was killed by a stray bullet while eating breakfast at her family's Omaha home.

Payton Benson, aged five, was caught in the crossfire of a gun battle between rival gangs about a block from her home in January 2014.

A year on, all the members of the gang behind her killing have pleaded guilty to various charges, and each face hefty jail sentences.

Website Omaha.com reported how Payton's mother Tabatha Manning said she was pleased that the family wouldn't have to face the ordeal of a trial.

“I don’t have to testify to the world what I saw when Payton died, ” she told the website. “I don’t want to share that with the world, because I don’t want everyone else’s hearts to break like mine has.”

A hail of at least 15 bullets were fired by the men at a rival gang, who were running through the streets near Payton's home in Omaha on January 15, 2014.

All of their shots missed their targets - but one penetrated Payton's apartment block and went through a wall and couch, hitting and killing the girl as she ate her breakfast.

Gang member Vincent Hicks faces at least 15 years in prison and a maximum of life behind bars after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and weapon use.

Jaylen Montgomery admitted to gun charges and could spend up to 54 years in prison. He will serve a minimum of eight years in jail.

Jacob Brown, aged 21, entered a plea of guilty on the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree murder. Both Brown and Adonus Moses, who pleaded no contest to the same charge, face up to 25 years behind bars.

Meanwhile, another gang member, Kevin Peak, who was found with a gun as detectives investigated the incident, could serve up to 25 years in prison.

He was not there on the day of the shooting, but pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a weapon. The men will be sentenced in April.

Police believe their car was chasing a rival gang member in rival gang territory before at least three of the men got out of the vehicle and opened fire.

The Wichita Eagle reported last year how the men had initially been arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with a stolen Jeep seen on surveillance video.

But police began to put the pieces of a bigger crime together through input from the community.

'These arrests are the product of a community that has stepped forward to assist law enforcement, coupled with gang and homicide detectives that have worked tirelessly to solve this case,' Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said in a written statement.

At the time of the shooting, witnesses told WOWT they heard at least 20 shots fired from multiple high-powered rifles.

‘What I heard was just massive amounts of gunfire, both guns had to be completely unloaded,’ Nick Todd said. ‘Both guns were very large guns. They weren't small guns.’

The family’s van had a flat tire after being struck by a separate stray bullet and Mrs Benson was unable to take Payton to hospital. 

The Fontenelle Park neighborhood, where 
the shootings occurred, is not known as a particularly violent area. There are 
only four violent crimes per 1,000 residents, according to the Omaha World-Herald.

The suspects: Police released surveillance footage showing at least three men getting out of the stolen Jeep

The getaway: Cops believe the men sped away in this vehicle

Callous: the stray bullets even pierced the tires of the family van, making it impossible to rush the dying girl to the hospital
