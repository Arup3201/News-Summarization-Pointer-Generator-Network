Paint peels from the walls, rubbish litters the floors and wild flora is gradually encroaching on this vast, crumbling monument to a disease that is now all but defeated in the West. 

Built to treat patients suffering from a disease that once was the cause of nearly a quarter of all deaths, these eerie images prove there is no longer any sign of life at this abandoned tuberculosis hospital.

Equipment lies gathering rust and walls are left crumbling in the desolate sanatorium, shot by Johnny Joo, 24, a photographer who specialises in capturing the gradual decay of abandoned places.

Going back to nature: The outside of the J.N. Adam Memorial Hospital for Tuberculosis in Perrysburg, NewYork

Deserted: The sanatorium, first built in 1909, has been abandoned since 1995 due to an ownership dispute

Colonial style: The sanatorium was modelled after southern plantations, complete with ornate columns and open balconies

Desolate: Weak light streams into the hospital interior through high windows and an ornate stained-glass skylight

Trashed: Lunch trays and broken glass litter the floor and paint peels from the walls in what appears to be some kind of kitchen

Spooky: Another view of what seems to be a kitchen gives a better look at a mystery machine left behind when the hospital was closed

Hygiene: Hydraulic-powered bath tubs remain from the institution's latter days as the J. N. Adam State School for Severely Mentally Retarded

Abandoned: The photographer uses remote flash to highlight this old wheelchair simply left behind when the building was closed

Reclaimed: Weeds grow from the floor where light streams in through a miraculously intact window in a room of the hospital 

The hospital in Perrysburg, New York, is hidden amid more than 500 acres of forest. It began life in 1909 when the U.S. was suffering a tuberculosis epidemic as a place for long-term sufferers to recuperate or, just as likely, to die.

By the 1960s however antibiotics, vaccines and screening programmes were beginning to gradually defeat the disease in developed countries and such facilities were no longer needed. The sanatorium began a new life as an institution for the treatment of developmental disabilities.

Mr Joo, who travelled from his home in Cleveland, Ohio, to photograph the hospital, said: 'The space ran as a tuberculosis ward from 1909 until the 1960s when it was then turned to the state of New York, who would continue to use it as a developmental disability centre.

'By 1995, the end to treatment of such disabilities in an institutionalised setting had come to an end and since then it has sat vacant.

'It now sits as an empty gem full of nothing but stale air and asbestos.'

Mayor James Noble Adam, for whom the hospital is named, purchased the 293-acre site and donated it to the city in the early 1900s before it was officially opened in 1909.

It was listed on New York's register of historical places in 1985, but was nevertheless abandoned in 1995 and has sat gathering dust ever since.

Decay: Pockmarked walls and ceilings and floors littered with debris scar the corridors of this once crucial medical facility

Crumbling: The hospital in Perrysburg, New York, is hidden amid more than 500 acres of forest which is gradually reclaiming the site

Bare bones: Plaster has crumbled to expose the bare brickwork around this staircase inside the hospital 

Peeling: Old paint lies on the floor like the leaves of autumn in this room which appears to have once been a hospital ward 

Mysterious: An industrial size extractor fan suggests this room was once a kitchen or some kind of food preparation area

Tumbledown: The trees encroach ever closer to the hospital building and it's only a matter of time before they start entering the site

Forlorn: The hospital's once-busy buildings are now faded and grey as the passage of time takes its toll

Beautiful setting: The hospital campus and its gentle sloping grounds are in Cattaraugus County, New York

Enchanting: Sunlight picks out one of the hospital's buildings like a ray of hope that this place will not totally be forgotten

Mr Joo said: 'This massive location was commissioned by Buffalo mayor J.N. Adam to be built in 1909, to house and treat carriers of The White Plague, known as tuberculosis.

'Most Western New York residents have not even set eyes on this massive structure as it is surrounded by 500 acres of forest on each side.

'This complex is one of several buildings in the area designed by architect John H. Coxhead - his most well-known being the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church.

'The sanatorium was modelled after southern plantations, complete with ornate columns, and open balconies every which way you turn your head.

'These balconies were used in the treatment of patients, letting them rest in the open air with high altitudes, which were recommendations for treatment of the disease.

'People had lived out their lives here and with enough space to do so.

'One of my favourite rooms would have to be the main dining hall as it resembles a chapel with its dome-ceiling room.

'It comes complete with ornately designed stained-glass window atop its roof and would have been the main section for patients to join together at mealtimes.'

In the latter half of the building's life it was in fact a centre for the treatment of developmental disorders
