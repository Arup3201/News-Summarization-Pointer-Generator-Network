A millionaire's daughter was in an ‘intimate relationship’ with a robber and drug dealer she claimed had forced her to drive a getaway car during last year’s riots, a court heard yesterday.

Laura Johnson, 20, said the man, known as Sylar, threatened her by putting his hands around her throat and applying pressure with his thumbs.

She claimed she was left terrified after he and two friends spoke of  knives and guns, and showed her mobile phone footage of torture.

treated for anxiety and depression before the riots

The Exeter University student said 
she was so scared that she drove them around South-East London as they 
looted a haul of electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes on August 9, 
one of the worst nights of the riots. However, the prosecution has 
dismissed Johnson’s claims, saying she ‘knew what she was doing’.

Yesterday, Johnson’s friend Charlie  
Fryett told a jury that far from being  terrified, Johnson had behaved 
flirtatiously with Sylar, and that the pair were on ‘close’ terms.

Miss Fryett, 20, told Inner London 
Crown Court that she had met Johnson at Green Parks House psychiatric 
outpatients unit in Orpington in April last year. Soon she had 
introduced Johnson to lots of her ‘black, male friends’.

She said she was aware that Johnson, a
 former pupil of St Olave’s Grammar School,  was depressed after 
splitting from her boyfriend, and that she had self-harmed and attempted
 an overdose.

Miss Fryett told the court they had 
both ‘fancied’ Sylar, who liked to listen to violent gangster rap. 
However, the girls had drifted apart after he appeared to be more 
interested in Johnson.

The final straw for their friendship 
came on August 9 last year when Miss Fryett phoned Johnson and heard 
Sylar’s voice in the background, the jury heard.

‘I felt betrayed, I felt like people were going behind my back again,’ she said.

Watched by Johnson’s parents Robert 
and Lindsay, who run Avongate, a direct marketing company, she told the
 court that Johnson and Sylar had a close relationship: ‘They would meet
 up and sit in a car together,’ she said.

‘They had had close contact. They had kissed and stuff. She said he came on to her and whatever happened in the car happened.

‘She was flirting towards him so I blame her for bringing it on. She came across as easy.’

A police officer yesterday  also 
revealed how he feared for his life when Johnson revved her car engine 
at him after he shouted at her to stop.

PC Chris Bramley told the jury that 
he saw the student sitting in her black Smart car as three black youths 
filled it with stolen goods from Comet.

Police later found three stolen TVs, 
alcohol and cigarettes inside the vehicle, while a microwave was 
discovered on the floor nearby. ‘When I approached the front of the car I
 heard the engine revving,’ he told the jury.

‘I believed my life was  in danger. I
 had my baton and I struck the front windscreen causing damage. I again 
heard the engine revving and again hit it, again causing damage.’

Johnson, of Orpington, Kent, has pleaded not guilty to  burglary and handling stolen goods.

A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be 
named for legal reasons, of Lewisham, South-East London, denies burglary
 and handling stolen goods but has admitted burgling a BP petrol 
station.

The trial continues.
