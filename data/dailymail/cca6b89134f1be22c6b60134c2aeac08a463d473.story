Problem: Around 60 per cent of children have been asked to take an explicit self-portrait on their mobiles

Teachers should look through pupils’ mobile phones to delete  sexual photos, a minister said yesterday.

Norman Baker, a Home Office minister, said young people had to be taught about the risks of sending intimate photographs of themselves by text, email or instant messaging – a practice known as ‘sexting’.

But he came under pressure to go further and ban teenagers from owning smartphones if they are caught using handsets for bullying.

The Internet Watch Foundation revealed last year that as well as being shared on teens’ smartphones, tens of thousands of explicit self-portraits taken by teenagers are ending up on websites viewed by paedophiles.

Children's charity ChildLine also warns that young people are taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images.

Some are being driven to the brink of suicide when photos sent to one person they think they can trust become widely shared online.

The government has given teachers powers to search pupils for any electronic device, which human rights groups claimed amounted to an ‘excessive’ intrusion into children’s lives.

Opponents likened the new rules to police controls to investigate terrorists.

But Mr Baker insisted teachers must take responsibility for images on pupil’s phones, if they are being used to intimidate and harass other children.

He told the Commons: ‘We have given teachers stronger powers to tackle cyber-bullying by searching for and, if necessary, deleting inappropriate images or files on electronic devices, including mobile phones.

‘It is critical to educate young people about the risks of sending intimate photographs.’

However, unions said it was not the job of teachers to police the contents of pupils' devices.

Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT, said: 'It is completely inappropriate for teachers to be placed in the position of ‘policing’ pupils’ phones.

'Schools can make a valuable and important contribution to advising pupils on how to keep safe when using the internet and social media but it is not teachers’ responsibility to scrutinise and censor phones.'

Home Office Norman Baker said teachers now have the power to delete images from phones, but Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for a smartphone ban for bullies

The Child Exploitation and Online 
Protection Centre has drawn up specific guidance for teachers on how to 
tackle sexting in schools.

This
 month David Cameron announced he wanted children to be taught about the
 dangers of online bullying and ‘sexting’ in sex education classes.

The Prime Minister said he wanted youngsters to be warned about the perils of using the internet and smartphones.

But Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for the government to go further and ban children from using smartphones altogether if they are caught using sexting images to bully other pupils.

She said: ‘Many young people have been pressured into sending intimate photographs of themselves only to find that those images are sometimes posted, distributed or shared without their consent, which is an important form of bullying and harassment.’

She asked Mr Baker: ‘What measures have been taken, and do you support measures to prevent smart phone use by those who are not mature enough to understand that it can result in an important form of bullying?’

Charities warn that some children are being driven to the brink of suicide after photos they have taken became widely shared

But Mr Baker insisted: ‘There are numerous laws in place that can be used to deal with those who behave in this appalling manner.’

ChildLine director, Peter Liver, said the rise of classroom sexting was linked, in part, to the widespread availability of porn online.

One teenager, 17-year-old James, told the charity: 'Sexting is pretty normal at my age. It seems like everyone's doing it.'

James said he still engaged in sexting despite the dangers. 'I do worry about who is behind the phones of the people I sext with - obviously if you don't know the person in real life there's no guarantee they are who they say they are,' he added.
