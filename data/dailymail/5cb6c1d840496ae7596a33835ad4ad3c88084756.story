A comedian who began her career by telling jokes to her dying sister has now been crowned Britain's top woman comic.

Jayde Adams, 29, was asked by her sister Jenna Adams to keep everyone in high spirits after she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.

So Ms Adams, originally from Bristol, started telling jokes at her sister's hospital bedside.

When her sister died two years later, Ms Adams felt inspired to carry on making people laugh and decided to forge a new career.

Now, after two years on the stand-up circuit, Ms Adams has won the coveted Funny Women Award 2014.

Ms Adams, who now lives in London, said: 'When I got to the hospital, Jenna asked me to tell jokes because she said "everyone is looking at me like I'm going to die".

'She couldn't handle the pressure of making people sad.

'When my sister died, I was determined. I had this new sense of responsibility to live not just my own life, but hers as well.

'She started me on this career path, no doubt about it. That's really when I became aware of comedy, when she asked me to make some jokes at her hospital bedside, to distract us all from the illness.

'She would be so proud of what I am doing. All I'm told is how proud she would be of me by family and her friends.'  

After her diagnosis, Ms Adams' sister was treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. She married and moved to Portsmouth in 2009, where she died two years later, aged 28. 

Soon after, Ms Adams began performing, incorporating jokes, rap, beat-boxing, dance and even opera singing into her shows.

One of her acts in the semi-final of the competition involved pretending to be an Asda fishmonger - a job she used to do

She said: 'Before that, I was at university but I wasn't getting where I wanted to be. It all come together for me after that happened.

'I always looked up to her because everyone loved her. It was a different experience, watching her become ill and deteriorate, and it shaped my work.

'People say you are what you eat but I don’t remember eating a goddess.'

Speaking with a thick Bristolian accent: 'I ain't from round these parts... I'm from China.' 

Doing a send-up of Adele, she says: ''ave you ’eard ’ow meaningful my lyrics are? Does anybody actually know what a Skyfall is?”

'Why is a cat like a comma? Because with a comma the clause comes before the pause and with a cat the paws comes from the claws.'

'I use things from all aspects of my life now to make people laugh. Sometimes, as my comedy is banter based, if a similar situation arises I will talk about her and it.

'While comedians try to see the funny side in everything, it is still really tough.'

Like any comedian, Ms Adams started her cabaret-style shows in smaller venues, touring pubs and clubs.

But when her boss insisted she started calling herself a comedian, her confidence grew.

Ms Adams, who used to be a fishmonger at Asda, performed in the final of the award last month at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.

Her winning performance included a rendition of Nessun Dorma in a nude suit.

Previous winners of the award - which was launched in 2003 - include Zoe Lyons, Andi Osho, Katherine Ryan and Gabby Best.   

Jenna died in 2011, aged 28. Ms Adams is putting her prize money from the competition back into a campaign to raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK

Ms Adams said winning the award has shown just how far she has come since being at her sister's bedside.

She said: 'Getting this award is an honour, it a massive deal. Women who have won it in the past have gone on to great things. 

'I think it has made my parents really proud, and distracted us all a bit from the sadness in the past. 

She won a £2,000 prize, which she is putting back into a campaign to raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK.

Inspired by her sister's experience, she wants to start her own charity.

She said: 'This is a massive part of why I want to get a bigger profile. When someone dies you feel very useless. This has allowed me and my mum to feel less useless.

'I would like to bring comedy to people. You can't always force comedy on people but there is a saying that laughter is the best medicine.

'I had someone come up to me the other day who was suffering and they said I was the first person who has made them laugh in the last year and that felt special.' 

Ms Adams has been raising money for the charity for the past two years. She and her mother Gail are now organising a comedy and dancing gig following the Jenna Adams Charity Ball on November 22. It will raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK and the Epilepsy Society.
