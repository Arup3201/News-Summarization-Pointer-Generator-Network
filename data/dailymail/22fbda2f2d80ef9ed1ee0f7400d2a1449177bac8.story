It's the news that's bound to have queues of screaming teenage girls lining up - One Direction's wax works have been giving a restyle at Madame Tussauds London.

The group have been seasonally adjusted with a new look for summer, to chime with their recent announcement of a concert film of their Where We Are international tour.

The original wax dummies of the band members were unveiled last April by the infamous tourist honey-trap, whipping young teenage fans into a frenzy - the new look will no doubt be met with equal hysteria and Instagramming.

Matthew Clarkson, Madame Tussauds London Marketing Manager, said: 'We never doubted that One Direction would be a huge hit here at Madame Tussauds London, and as the band goes from strength to strength, they continue to be firm favourites with our guests.'

He added: 'They arrived in April last year dressed in clothing donated by the group, but we want to make sure the figures reflect the boys' latest, more summery style. Die hard fans will recognise these new outfits which are inspired by their recent This Is Us tour look.'

Everything changes - though Madame Tussauds may have their work cut out for them in attempting to keep abreast of the fickle world of pop and fashion.

The new waxworks of the group sit on a school-style bench where fans can sit and pose for selfies  with the snazzy dressed band members.

Zayn is in Dusseldorf, wearing a Harley Davidson T-shirt and black boots, Liam in red checked shirt and high-tops, last seen on the Edinburgh leg of the tour,  Louis in Stone Roses t-shirt and Niall colourful and jaunty in a green sleeved white top with blue skinny jeans.

The band's high-haired heart-throb Harry Styles is fashionable yet understated in black skinny jeans and trademark tan suede boots, with a black and white print shirt and black bandana as worn in their Wembley shoews.

Don't miss these firm fixtures, who have their own private room at Madame Tussauds; you can even save 50% when booking online for visits after 6pm until Sunday, August 31.
