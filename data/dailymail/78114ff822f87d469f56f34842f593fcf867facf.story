A Los Angeles man taken off a United Airlines flight the day after the massacre at the Paris offices of Charle Hebdo because a flight attendant believed he was one of the murderers has spoken out about his unhappiness at how the airline treated him following his ordeal. 

Elliot Pembrook was detained by federal agents upon arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport on a United flight from Frankfurt, Germany, where he had been visiting his fiancée.

United had contacted the feds after a member of the flight crew grew suspicious that Pembrook, 31, might have been Al-Qaeda extremist Said Kouachi, 34, who was shot by French police outside Paris later that day.

Said Kouachi and his brother Cherif had forced their way into the offices of the satirical weekly newspaper and killed 12 people on 7 January.  

After being marched off the United flight, Pembrook was held for two hours before he was eventually released and allowed to continue his journey home to Los Angeles.

Pembrook told NJ Advance Media that he had no issue with being detained by the feds - who he says were just doing their job - but believes his ordeal could have been avoided if the concerned flight attendant had simply spoken to him and realized he was clearly an American rather than French citizen.

The passenger's fury concerns the fact that no one from the airline sought him out to check how he was doing or even to apologize after his release 

Instead, Pembrook only heard from United after he contacted them days later to see if they planned to make amends.

Three weeks later he received a belated apology via email and a $500 credit.

'We hope that he will understand that our apology is sincere and that he will give us another chance,' read the email, which Pembrook has described as a 'slap in the face.'

'I wanted an apology, and I just wanted some kind of explanation from the flight attendant, a specific apology from her,' Pembrook told NJ Advance Media.

Pembrook, who is mixed race, has acknowledged he matched a broad description of the suspect, but says he deserved to be treated with more respect.

'Customs said that United's decision was stupid but that they had to act, and the U.S. Marshal that showed up simply asked, 'Is this the guy?' and then immediately left,' he said.

'No one from United ever showed up during any of this or at the end to even blurt out an, "Oops I'm sorry.'" 

A United spokesman insists that the crew responded appropriately during the flight.

'Whenever a crew member or a customer has cause for concern, relaying that concern to the proper authorities is absolutely the right thing to do,' said Rahsaan Johnson. 

'The authorities are the right ones to determine whether the threat is legitimate.'

He did however concede that United should have apologized immediately to Pembrook.
