The billionaire boss of Victoria's Secret is suing an auction house after he paid a record-breaking £10.9 million for a rare Ferrari despite an ongoing legal row over ownership.

Les Wexner, 77, bought the 1954 Ferrari 375-Plus, one of just five built, at this summer's Goodwood Festival of Speed.

It is the highest price ever publicly paid for a road-legal car in England and, at the time, was the world's third most expensive car sold at auction.

But the tycoon is unhappy over ongoing legal arguments regarding the ownership of the Ferrari and is demanding a full refund and damages.

He has now launched a High Court lawsuit against the prestigious auction house Bonhams.

Part of the Ferrari was stolen from Ohio in the 1980s and imported to Belgium, kicking off years of legal disputes on both sides of the Atlantic.

Bonhams brought the US and European parties together and they signed an agreement designed to 'extinguish all claims and counterclaims' regarding the car in 2013.

The auction house was then appointed to sell the Ferrari with the catalogue stating that 'all relevant litigation' with the car had been 'settled'.

But documents filed at the High Court dispute this claim.

A statement issued on behalf of Wexner's lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, said: 'The allegations set out in the claim against Bonhams and the sellers are that despite their knowledge of the ongoing litigation in relation to the ownership of the car, false representations to the contrary were made to the buyer prior to sale, either fraudulently or recklessly.'

The Ferrari, known as 0384 AM, was the star lot at the Goodwood Festival of Speed sale on June 27.

It had been campaigned successfully in the 1950s, picking up a number of victories including a win at Silverstone.

Under the bonnet is a 4.9-litre engine which developed a staggering 330bhp, giving it a 0-60mph time of just four seconds and a top speed of 186mph. 

Mr Wexner has asked for a declaration of valid rescission of the sale of the Ferrari, restitution of monies paid by the buyer, damages and compound interest.

The businessman and Copley Motorcars, a US dealer which acted for Mr Wexner at the sale, have declined to comment further.

A statement from Bonhams said: 'We are satisfied that any claim is wholly without merit and will be strongly contested.'
