Hillary Clinton has been accused of deleting all her emails while under subpoena.

The allegation, leveled by a Republican chairman for a House committee on Benghazi, is the latest in a series of claims that are hammering the former First Lady's reputation as 2016 approaches.

In a letter released on Friday night, Rep Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said the former Secretary of State has failed to produce a single new document in recent weeks and has refused to relinquish her server to a third party for an independent review.

Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, rubbished the claims.

The latest: Hillary Clinton (left), a likely Democratic candidate for 2016, wiped all her emails from her server while under subpoena, according to Benghazi committee chairman Trey Gowdy (right) on Friday night

Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential candidate, faced a Friday deadline to respond to a subpoena for emails and documents related to Libya, including the 2012 attacks in a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to   Libya.

The Benghazi committee demanded further documents and access to the server after it was revealed that Clinton used a private email account and server during her tenure at State.

House Speaker John Boehner has not ruled out a vote in the full House to force Clinton to turn over the server if she declines to make it available by Gowdy's April 3 deadline.

In a six-page letter released late on Friday, Kendall defended Clinton, saying she had turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. That included everything sent or received during her tenure as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.

'The Department of State is therefore in possession of all Secretary Clinton's work-related emails from the (personal email) account,' Kendall wrote.

Kendall also said it would be pointless for Clinton to turn over her server, even if legally authorized, since 'no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server.' 

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Benghazi panel, said Kendall's letter confirmed 'what we all knew: that Secretary Clinton already produced her official records to the State Department, that she did not keep her personal emails and that the Select Committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in Benghazi.' 

Dispute: The claims come as the former Secretary of State defends her use of a private email system

No take two? Analysts warn the saga could have a devastating affect on Clinton's approval ratings before the 2016 Presidential race, which could hamper her chances of a second White House stint with husband Bill

Cummings said it is time for Gowdy and other Republicans to stop what he called a 'political charade' and instead make Clinton's emails public. Gowdy also should schedule Clinton's public testimony before the Benghazi panel as soon as possible, Cummings said.

Kendall said in his letter that Clinton's personal attorneys reviewed every email sent and received from her private email address — 62,320 emails in total — and identified all work-related emails. 

Those totaled 30,490 emails or approximately 55,000 pages. The material was provided to the State Department on December 5, 2014, and it is the agency's discretion to release those emails after a review.

Kendall said Clinton has asked for the release of all of those emails. He said the State Department is reviewing the material to decide whether any sensitive information needs to be protected.

'Secretary Clinton is not in a position to produce any of those emails to the committee in response to the subpoena without approval from the State Department, which could come only following a review process,' Kendall wrote.

Gowdy said he was disappointed at Clinton's lack of cooperation.

'Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,' he said.

In a statement released later Friday, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said she 'would like her emails made public as soon as possible and ... she's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public.'
