A teenage girl missing since July - from an area in Florida where neighbours said three suspects in  the 'house of horrors' gang had come from earlier this month - has been located in Philadelphia.

It's the latest twist in the extraordinary story of the filthy basement where four disabled victims were kept chained to a boiler, which reeked of 
waste from the buckets they used to relieve themselves.

Three of the four victims today spoke out of their horror at being locked up in a low-ceiling, dank room that contained a mattress with bedding and a flat board with a pillow and a boiler.

Horror chamber: The dark and filthy basement in Philadelphia where four disabled people were kept chained to pipes and made to usual buckets as toilets

Vile: Makeshift beds and dirty blankets filled the sub-basement which was home to four vulnerable individuals who were being robbed for their social security cheques

The squalid conditions of the sub-basement were revealed behind a locked door under apartments in the city's Tacony 
neighbourhood. There were a few water bottles but no food.

And now there's a new twist. Benita Rodriguez, who was missing since July from West Palm Beach in Florida, where neighbours said the group had come from earlier this month, has been found.

'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong... I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was coming up'

Victim Derwin McLemire

The girl's mother said the 
15-year-old had been friends with one of the suspect's sons, Gregory 
Thomas Jr, and was found by Philadelphia police on Monday. UPI reported that she was found with the three suspects in the case.

She was not in the basement with 
the four adults but was found shortly after they were. Details surrounding Miss Rodriguez's connection to the case 
are sketchy and police are not yet sure how much she knew about the 
'house of horrors'.

Meanwhile, the identity of one victim has been 
revealed as Herbert Knowles, who went missing three years ago from his 
home in Norfolk, Virginia. 

The family of Mr Knowles, 40, said he 
moved in with a girlfriend and her mother, Linda Weston three years ago.
That was the last time they heard from him until he was rescued at the 
weekend.

Found: Benita Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July 4 from West Palm Beach, Florida, has also been located by Philadelphia police. Her boyfriend's father is one of the three suspects - Gregory Thomas

Mr Knowles's niece Tiffany Davis told Wavy TV: 'The way they describe him, as if he was some kind of animal. You got him chained in the basement. All the lights are out. There are buckets for him to use the bathroom.'

Derwin McLemire, 41, another victim, told KYW: 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong.' The North Carolina man said he tried to escape from Weston's home 'and I didn't get away, so they got me'.

Mr McLemire had forgotten what day it was after being held captive for so long. 'I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was coming up,' he told CBS Philly.

He said of his alleged captor Linda Ann Weston: 'She wouldn’t let me do nothing.'

A third victim was identified by Tamara Breeden. She alleged to KYW that she was hit in the head by Weston and 'all this was bleeding and everything'. The fourth victim's name has not been released.

Ms Breeden, 29, was reported missing six years ago - but the case was reportedly closed by police last year in Philadelphia even though detectives had not found her, reported myFOXphilly.com.

There were growing fears that the cases were part of a wider network to abuse and steal social security 
cheques from the vulnerable after  identity cards and power-of-attorney forms for 50 people were discovered upstairs.

Three people have been arrested in 
connection with the incident. Two have been identified as Linda Ann 
Weston, 51, and Gregory Thomas, 47.

Eddie 
Wright, 50, homeless, was also facing charges of criminal conspiracy, 
aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, 
false imprisonment and other related charges, according to police.

Lieutenant Ray Evers said: 'Without a 
doubt. This is just the beginning of this investigation. We think she's 
been doing this for quite some time.'

The 'dungeon', as it was described by officials, was littered with bottles, blankets and clothing items.

The four captives, who are said to have the mental age of a ten-year-old, were taken to Frankford Hospital and have since been discharged to a group home, where they were being looked after.

Police said they were malnourished and some had bruises and bed sores. At least one was kept chained to a pipe in the room.

They are thought to have been held captive for more than a year.

It was also revealed that Weston, the
alleged ringleader of the gang, had previously served eight years for 
starving someone to death.

She
was convicted of starving Bernardo Ramos, 25, to death after he refused
to support her sister's unborn child, the Philadelphia Inquirer 
reported.

Police said while officers were in the
basement of the eight-unit apartment building, they heard a noise 
behind a locked steel door that sounded like a dog.

The 
door was opened to reveal four people in a room not tall enough for an adult to stand up straight in.

It was not clear how the suspects know the victims - a 
29-year-old female and three males, aged 31 to 41.

On Saturday night, evidence 
technicians carted out several feet of chains from the basement of the 
apartment building.

One emergency responder overheard some of the captives say they were handing over their government checks to a caretaker.

A police spokesman said that getting information 
from the victims had been difficult due to their disabilities, but they 
apparently had been brought to Philadelphia about ten days before they 
were found. They had apparently been in West Palm Beach, Florida, and 
before that in Texas.

Philadelphia Police Deputy 
Commissioner Richard Ross said: 'This case just makes you shake your 
head; it's despicable and unspeakable.

When you look at the conditions under which they were kept, it's something out of a dungeon actually.'

Joan Sendef, who lives several blocks away, told the Philly News: 'You think you've seen it all.

'When it lands in your front door, it's really heartbreaking. It's so sad - these are human beings.'
