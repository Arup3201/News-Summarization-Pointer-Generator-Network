A music teacher is on a mission to save a famous Yorkshire song claiming most young people in the region don't know the tune or the words.

Traditional folk song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at - said to mean on Ilkley Moor without a hat - is regarded as part of Yorkshire's heritage.

But Gordon Eddison, 55, from Otley, West Yorkshire, was shocked to discover that very few children have heard of the song.

Now he has vowed to re-introduce the Victorian anthem back into hearts and minds across the region and has launched a campaign to preserve it.

Mr Eddison, who is also Otley Brass Band's conductor, said when he asked youngsters if they knew the words, they either had no knowledge of it at all, and one child asked: 'Did Muse record it?'

He added: 'This cannot go on. We owe it to our Yorkshire Heritage
to preserve this song in the minds of our young people and not let it 
be relegated to words on a novelty tea-towel.

'Singing is vital to 
our children’s musical and social education, parents and grandparents 
should immediately put this right, teach them to sing On Ilkla Moor Baht
‘at now.'

Anecdotally, Mr Eddison believes only 10 per cent of children know what the song is.

He thinks parents and grandparents might think their children are taught the song in school, but they're not.

To make his point he took members of Otley Brass Band to Cow and Calf rocks on Ilkley Moor where the lyrics are believed to have been composed.

Mr Eddison hopes to encourage schools to
teach pupils the song and envisages an annual brass band competition to
honour the tune, with a performance on the moor, the Daily Telegraph 
said.

The song tells of a lover courting the object of his affections, Mary Jane, on Ilkley Moor without a hat (baht 'at).

The
singer chides the lover for his lack of headwear – for in the cold 
winds of Ilkley Moor this will mean his death from exposure.

This
will in turn result in his burial, the eating of his corpse by worms, 
the eating of the worms by ducks and finally the eating of the ducks by 
the singers.

Mr Eddison said when he asked youngsters if they knew the words, they either had no knowledge of it at all, and one child asked: 'Did Muse record it?'
