Catherine Mayer’s controversial biography claims both Charles and Princess Diana had to be ‘coaxed to the altar’.

The Prince and his fiancée had cold feet about the wedding and he reportedly told an adviser on the eve of the ceremony: ‘I can’t go through with it’.

The Prince was worried he was rushing into a marriage and Lady Diana knew the Prince had feelings for Camilla Parker Bowles.

Mayer, whose unauthorised biography ‘Charles: Heart of a King’ is published on Thursday, quotes one of the Prince’s confidants as saying that on the eve of the wedding in 1982 he ‘was desperate’.

The Telegraph reported last night how the Prince had been engaged to Lady Diana Spencer for five months after a brief courtship but she was ‘not the jolly country girl he had assumed’ but a complicated, vulnerable woman suffering from an eating disorder.

He is said to have told his aide: ‘I can’t go through with it, I can’t do it’.

Diana found a bracelet meant for the Duchess of Cornwall which had the initials GF engraved – which she believed stood for the pet names ‘Gladys’ and ‘Fred’ they had given each other. 

An alternative suggestion was that it was another nickname he had for Camilla - ‘Girl Friday’.

Her own pre-wedding wobbles have been well reported over the years. 

Diana told biographer, Andrew Morton, that she told her sisters: ‘I can’t marry him, I can’t do this, this is absolutely unbelievable.’

They said it was too late for her to change her mind as her ‘face is already on the tea towels’.

Mayer said: ‘She had no idea her bridegroom also had to be coaxed to the altar’. 

Catherine Mayer, author of the controversial biography which is published on Thursday, said she hoped the first in line to the throne liked the book but said she thought it was 'unlikely.' 

'There's a real substantial gap between the public perception of Prince Charles and who he is and what he has done,' she told This Morning. 

'People often define him as against Diana but in many ways they resemble each other in their impulse to make things better.'

Miss Mayer said she wrote the book after writing a cover piece for Time and had remarkably little access to the Prince for the piece, often speaking to contacts and his friends. 

She added: 'He is an extremely charitable entrepreneur with a most complex belief system and philosophy, which actually appears in his own book.' 

Miss Mayer said despite public belief the Prince was 'naive' at the time of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, having grown up in what she calls 'Planet Windsor' - 'a chilly planet.' 

She added: 'One of the reasons he is defined the way he is is because of his first marriage.

'One of the perceptions is that he was a cynical older man who lured an innocent girl into a relationship that was never going to be plausible.' 

Miss Mayer said she felt talk of Prince Charles' rise to the throne may be premature because he comes from a family that are incredibly long-lived. 

'When he comes to the throne, or if he comes to the throne, we will know he is a man of strong beliefs.'
