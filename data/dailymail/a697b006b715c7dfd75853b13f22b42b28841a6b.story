Patients with existing heart problems are most at risk as the drugs can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals linked to heart disease

Common indigestion drugs used by millions of Britons could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, according to research.

Scientists said the drugs, called proton pump inhibitors, can trigger a dangerous rise in chemicals in the body linked with heart disease.

Patients with existing heart problems, such as angina, are at most risk, but healthy adults with no history of such complaints could also be affected, the researchers said.

The number of prescriptions for PPIs such as lansoprazole and omeprazole – sold over the counter as Zanprol - has doubled in recent years to more than eight million a year, costing the NHS around £400million a year.

The exact number of patients on the drugs is not known because some buy them over the counter at high street chemists.

PPIs work by blocking the action of cells called proton pumps, which produce stomach acid.

Although very effective, they should only be used for a maximum of two months and preferably for between two and four weeks. 

But many patients quickly find they cannot live without them and ask for repeat prescriptions from their GP or buy them at the chemist.

Previous studies identified a potential link between the drugs and heart problems, although scientists conceded there was no obvious explanation for the connection.

Now experts at the Methodist Hospital Research Institute in Houston, Texas, believe they have uncovered the reason why.

After studying samples of human heart tissue, as well as carrying out experiments on mice, they found that PPIs triggered an increase in a chemical called asymmetric dimethylarginine, or ADMA, produced as the body’s cells make proteins.

It can hinder blood flow by blocking the release of nitric oxide, a gas which helps arteries to stay flexible and healthy.

The drugs are prescribed to be used for a maximum of two months but many patients find them hard to live without and buy more over the counter

The latest findings, published in the 
journal Circulation, show PPI medicines increase ADMA levels by about 25
per cent and reduce the ability of blood vessel walls to relax by more 
than 30 per cent.

In a report on their findings, the researchers said: ‘Several studies have raised concern that the use of PPIs in patients with acute coronary syndrome [heart disease] may increase their risk of major adverse events.

‘We found a plausible biological mechanism to explain this.’ Research leader Dr John Cooke said: ‘This surprising effect needs further investigation.’

The same drugs have also been found to increase the dangers of osteoporosis.
