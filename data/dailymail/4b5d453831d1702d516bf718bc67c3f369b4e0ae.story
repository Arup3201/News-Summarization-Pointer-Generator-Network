Angry: Sornnaly Hossain's furious father Syed says his daughter could have died after being locked in her school overnight

An epileptic teenager was trapped for 13 hours without her medication after a school locked her in a changing room overnight. 

Sornnaly Hossain's furious father says she could have died and is planning to sue Morpeth School in Bethnal Green, east London.

After she was rescued the 14-year-old spent two hours at the Royal London Hospital having tests following her ordeal, which left her feeling dizzy.

Her father Syed said he and his wife Khafija were gripped by panic after their daughter failed to return to her home on May 22.

He said: 'She went to school and she didn't come back.  At 5.30pm they locked the door without checking.

'When she didn't come home we were searching everywhere for her.

'We called all our relatives but they couldn't find her anywhere.'

Mr Hossain raised the alarm but police and social services looked around their home and not the school.

It was only at 6.30am the next morning police found her in the changing room.

Mr Hossain has now written to his MP, Rushanara Ali, and met local mayor Lutfur Rahman to discuss his concerns.

'What if my daughter had died?' he said.

'This isn't some small incident - she went without food and medicine.

'Why couldn't they care less about my daughter?

'I want to take action against the school and the police because of their carelessness.'

Probe: The council in east London say they are investigating how the teenager got locked inside Morpeth School overnight

The council have said they are investigating what happened. 

A Tower Hamlets Council spokesman said: 'The parents and headteacher of Morpeth School informed the council about this unfortunate incident.

'Both the council and school recognise that the episode will have been highly distressing for the child and her parents, as well as for school staff.

'Support is being offered.'

He added: 'The council has been working with the school and police to conduct a thorough investigation into how this incident happened and to ensure that all safety measures are securely in place.'
