Swansea City proved they are not a one-man team by rattling in six goals without star man Wilfried Bony who is away on African Cup of Nations duty and the subject of reported £25million interest from Manchester City.

French striker Bafetimbi Gomis scored twice as the Premier League side emphatically swept aside the challenge of League Two Tranmere – 81 places below them in the football pyramid. An entertaining match yielded five goals in the last 20 minutes alone.

Swansea, Capital One Cup winners in 2013, made nine changes from their previous Premier League game against QPR but bombarded Tranmere's goal before stand-in skipper Nathan Dyer broke the deadlock from 12 yards though home fans claimed he'd handled the ball before slamming a shot past Owain Fon Williams.

England under-21 international Tom Carroll, on loan from Spurs, extended the lead early in the second half with his first goal for the club and then Mo Barrow made it 3-0 from Gomis' cross early in the second half.

After that it was party time with both defences going AWOL and Swans goallkeeper Gerhard Tremmel suffering a nightmare.

His clearance rebounded against Max Power to allow Tranmere to pull it back to 3-1 but Gomis, a Crystal Palace target, made it 4-1 after 77 minutes. 

The tit-for-tat continued with Cole Stockton making it 4-2 following a Tranmere corner before substitute Wayne Routledge, allowed to play after his red card at QPR had been rescinded, fired in Gomis' pass. 

Gomis then scored with the final touch of the game though it was nice to see the 10,007 inside Prenton Park also applauded Tranmere off for their efforts.

'We controlled the game from start to finish, played good football and scored good goals,' said Swansea manager Garry Monk. 'Strikers thrive on goals and Gomis is a quality striker.'
