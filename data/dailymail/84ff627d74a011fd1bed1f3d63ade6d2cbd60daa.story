Traumatic: Pam Bailey, of Fareham, Hampshire, was taken to A&E in an ambulance while suffering from a water infection, vomiting and dehydration

A 90-year-old dementia sufferer was left waiting on a trolley in a hospital corridor for a shocking five hours, it was alleged today.

Pam Bailey was taken to A&E in an ambulance while suffering from a water infection, vomiting and dehydration and paramedics were said to have handed her to staff at 6:20pm at Queen Alexandra Hospital, in Portsmouth, Hampshire.

They allegedly put the widow of more than 30 years on a trolley bed in a packed corridor for five hours until she was seen by a doctor in a treatment room, confused and distressed.

She then allegedly had to wait until another four hours to be taken to a ward. An investigation has been launched by the hospital into the incident.

Mrs Bailey, a former Women's Royal Naval Servicewoman, said she had been left shaken by her ordeal. She was surrounded by another 25 patients waiting on trolleys, her family claimed.

Mrs Bailey, who still lives independently in Fareham, Hampshire, said: ‘I'm pretty shook up - it feels like the wait has cut years off my life. I think the hospital owes us something, but I don't know what it is exactly. A simple “sorry” would be a nice word for them to say to everybody.

‘For two-and-a-half years during the Second World War I was in the Wrens and we never had treatment like that. I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I had to that night.’

The nonagenarian, who was diagnosed with mild dementia a year ago, was 'periodically monitored' and put on a drip almost four hours after arriving.

Mrs Bailey's daughter Pauline Taylor, 64, sat with her during the long wait and said doctors told her to complain because it happens ‘all the time’.

Retired Mrs Taylor took photos of her in the queue and filed a complaint about the wait and her mother’s subsequent treatment.

She said that although she and her husband were with her, Mrs Bailey had been left upset and bewildered by the experience.

Mrs Taylor, of Gosport, Hampshire, said: ‘Mum was really dehydrated and in a bad way, so the doctor said we needed to get her to hospital.

‘The ambulance driver did say to me as we got into the ambulance that there was a queue at the hospital but I didn't know what she meant.

‘When she said that, I never thought of queuing on trolleys and certainly not for so long. Although the nurses took her temperature and blood pressure when we arrived, we were then left in the corridor.

‘It was a nightmare - I couldn't believe it. Because my mother has dementia and is elderly she didn't know where she was or what was happening.

‘The nurses, doctor and consultant were saying sorry, please put in a complaint, it happens a lot and it's not good enough. When we visited her the next day she thought we'd left her altogether - it was awful.

‘She was so cross and angry. Elderly people shouldn't be sitting in a busy corridor, there should be somewhere else for them to go. Mum is back home now but she's upset and will not go out.

‘This experience has really disturbed her and been an eye-opener for us.’

During her two night stay, Mrs Bailey was allegedly moved to two different wards. A Queen Alexandra Hospital spokesman said it is investigating but could not comment due to patient confidentiality.

The hospital aims to treat patients in 
time according to their clinical needs, she said, adding: ‘We have 
recently experienced an unprecedented increase in attendances to the 
department.’

The hospital must see 95 per cent of patients within four hours. But it failed to do so between September and December, according to papers from Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust Board.

On average, three out of every 14 people attending A&E at 6pm - a similar time to Mrs Bailey's admission - had to wait for more than four hours in November.

In comparison, it takes six minutes from admission to triage at nearby Southampton General Hospital.
