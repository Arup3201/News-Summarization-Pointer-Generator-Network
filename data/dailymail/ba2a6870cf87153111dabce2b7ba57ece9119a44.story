Lower Manhattan looks set to be extended into the East River after the scheme to expand a 1.3 mile stretch of land was ruled financially feasible.

The proposal, released last month, was dubbed Seaport City and could be built alongside a levee scheme aimed at offering protection from storm surges such as the one caused by Hurricane Sandy.

The expansion could provide two new city blocks as well as open space and according to documents is 'technically, legally and financially feasible.'

It is hoped that one of the benefits of creating both residential and commercial developments would help offset the construction costs that would run into billions of dollars and even fund additional resiliency programmes.

During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the shoreline of the East River rose to 19 feet above sea level highlighting the city's vulnerability to coastal flooding and storm surges.

Last year, another report first floated the idea of a 'multi-purpose levee' to protect the city from extreme weather. 

Dan Zarilli, director of New York City's Office of Recovery and Resiliency said: 'If we don't make something like this happen, we are totally exposed to the risk of climate change.

'We’re 
putting big, bold ideas out there because traditional solutions are 
going to prove ineffective. This is a feasible way to protect the city.'

Multi-purpose levees have been successfully implemented in flood-prone areas in the Netherlands, Japan and Singapore.

They are usually built in areas of particularly high vulnerabilities due to high population densities, concentration of economic activity, and the location of critical infrastructure systems.

It appears that the levee will run along the East River from East 13th Street to Corlears Hook Park, just south of the Williamsburg Bridge.

Building on reclaimed land in Manhattan has been taking place since the 17th century when it was still known as New Amsterdam.

The first expansion took place in 1646 under Peter Stuyvesant, who took over as the governor of New Amsterdam colony when the island of Manhattan was expanded between one and four blocks on each side.

But it was not until the 20th century that Lower Manhattan's geography underwent a dramatic transformation.

In 1934, construction began on the East River Drive (known now as the FDR Drive), expanding Manhattan to the east.

Running 9.5 miles from Lower Manhattan's Battery to the Triborough Bridge, the highway is built on a combination of landfill and pile-supported relieving platforms.

By 1976, Lower Manhattan had expanded an additional 23.5 acres with the creation of Battery Park City along the Hudson River, with 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the World Trade Center as its foundation.

The area became home to an upscale residential neighborhood with great schools and parks not far from New York's City bustling financial district, but the close proximity to the water has left that part of Manhattan prone to flooding.

Now, New York City has 400,000 people and 68,000 buildings inside the flood plain. 

The bridging berm will effectively raise the riverbank to nine feet above current level, which is more than four feet above Hurricane Sandy’s high-water mark.

Predicted timelines on how long the project will take to complete range from five to 35 years but the city has already started to consult with the local community on plans.

Manhattan has been subject to a series of land reclamations, the first of which took place in 1646 when the island expanded between one and four blocks on each side.

The berm will also provide better access to the park, left, which is largely cut off from the neighbourhood by the highway

However, it was Lower Manhattan's violent encounter with Sandy, which overwhelmed the streets with water and plunged most of the area into darkness, that made local residents, business owners and city officials realise how truly vulnerable that reclaimed land was.

In 2000, the Guggenheim Foundation announced plans to build a 400 foot tall building south of the Brooklyn Bridge near to Battery Park on the East River waterfront.

However, two years later it was revealed the project had been cancelled as foundation director Frank Gehry acknowledged the prospect of finding the $950million funding was unrealistic.

In November 2000, the Guggenheim Foundation announced plans to develop piers and build a 400-foot tall building south of the Brooklyn Bridge on reclaimed land in Lower Manhattan.

The foundation were said to have pledged $67.8 million towards the project, which was to include a new Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry.

Mr Gehry designed Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao and crowds were drawn to view the plans at the New York museum on Fifth Avenue.

The plans showed it would have had 200,000 square feet of exhibition space, a theatre and a centre for arts education as well as six acres of open space.

It would have been built on connecting platforms extending from Old Slip to Maiden Lane.

However, just two years later the plans were dropped from a report released by city mayor Michael Bloomberg called 'New York City's Vision for Lower Manhattan'.

Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens acknowledged that the $950million needed to finance the project would be unrealistic to find.

In a statement at the time he said: 'The Guggenheim project has to be rethought, perhaps on a more modest level, and certainly in the context of the city's master plan for the development of Lower Manhattan.'
