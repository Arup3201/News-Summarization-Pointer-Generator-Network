This is the incredible moment a baby buffalo managed to escape certain death after being taken down by two lions.

Seen struggling for its life, the poor creature is pictured being pinned to the ground while the huge predators sink their teeth into its neck.

But not willing to let their little one become lunch, the buffalo are seen regrouping, ready to fight back against the formidable felines.

South African photographer Jay van Rensburg caught the moment that lions attacked a buffalo calf - but got more than they bargained for

Brave: An adult female lunges for the lion that pinned down her calf, forcing the big cat to leap out of the way

Caring: The buffalo herd help the dazed and wounded calf to its feet once the lions have been chased away

After one brave young female makes a charge for the lions, other buffalos begin to take notice, spurring them into action.

Experienced South African photographer Jay van Rensburg, 53,  then managed to capture the moment a large bull attempted to gore one of the lions, forcing it to leap to safety.

Spotted on the plains of the Kruger National Park, the young calf is seen wearily getting to its feet as the unlucky lions are chased away.

Jay said: 'My heart started racing as I made my way along the road closer to where the action was but I managed to grab my camera and position the vehicle.

Brave: This female buffalo makes her displeasure known to the lion, which desperately clings on to its prey

Victorious: The buffalo herd gather around the young animal and help it stand up

Sentry duty: A buffalo bull stares at the lion after their epic battle and keeps it at bay

Weary: The calf is comforted by one of the herd after being mauled by the lions

'As the herd stampeded away from the fast approaching lion, the young buffalo fell behind and in one swift movement, the lion leapt onto the young buffalo.

'It could be that the two lions had made an earlier unsuccessful attack on the young buffalo as it looked as if the attacking lion knew exactly who his target was.

'The noise and dust caused by around 30 buffalo trying to escape a charging Lion was overwhelming.

'As the first lion struggled with the young buffalo on the ground, the second lion jumped on top and began wrestling with it, trying to deliver the final blow.

'All of a sudden, the herd stopped and a few female buffalos made their way toward where the young buffalo was fighting for its life.

'About four or five female buffalos faced the lion with heads low when from the side a larger bull appeared and charged the lion.

'A second bull then came in from the opposite side and it was as if they helped the young buffalo onto its feet.

'Buffalo have an amazingly strong group bond and when they are confronted with danger, they stand together to face the enemy

'Apart from it being a major adrenaline rush, it was mixed emotions for me, I felt sorry for the young buffalo but this is nature in its truest sense.'
