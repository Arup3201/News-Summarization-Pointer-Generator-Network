A third of Americans think Congress should impeach President Barack Obama, polls released today show.

Left-leaning publication the Huffington Post along with polling partner YouGov and right-leaning polling company Rasmussen Reports came up with roughly the same percent of Americans who think Congress should bring formal charges against the president in separate polls that were released this morning.

The poll-takers also found that 68 and 58 percent of Republicans, respectively, think the president should be impeached.

Give him the boot: A third of Americans think Congress should formally bring charges against President Barack Obama

A third of Americans who took the Huffpost/YouGov poll said Congress should impeach President Obama

Congressional leadership has no intention
 of drawing up articles of impeachment for Obama, but a lawsuit the 
House plans to bring against the president for 'making his own laws' 
has stirred up impeachment talk.

House Speaker John Boehner has repeatedly said the lower chamber's lawsuit, which is centered on Obamacare, is about reigning in the president, not kicking him out of office.

However, far-right Republicans - including former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, have argued that impeachment would send a clearer message to nation's executive.

'You don’t bring a lawsuit to a gunfight and there’s no room for lawyers on our front lines,' Palin told Fox News last Tuesday.

'Washington is broken. If people are about the future of this country
 and defense of our republic, they will join this cause of articles of 
impeachment against Obama because enough is enough,' she continued.

Boehner and other congressional Republicans who have been asked about impeachment say the House's lawsuit is a better long-term strategy to preventing presidents moving forward - not just Obama -  from going around Congress to enact their own laws.

'The path that we're going is the right one to defend our institution against the encroachment from the Executive Branch and to preserve the Constitution of our country as it was written and as it was intended,' Boehner told reporters last Thursday.

A total of 26 percent of respondents to the Huffpost/YouGov poll who said they were not Republicans said Congress should impeach the president

While the battle cry for impeachment is coming primarily from Republicans, some Democrats and more than a third of independents took the HuffPost/YouGov poll also think Obama has gone too far and needs be punished by Congress. Overall, 26 percent of people who do not self-identify as Republicans said Obama should be impeached.

Rasmussen found that 87 percent of Democrats think Congress shouldn't bring charges against the president. Americans who didn't identify with either of the two major political parties were split, with 52 percent giving impeachment a thumbs down.

The conservative polling company also found that respondents were divided on whether it would be bad for the country if some members of Congress tried to impeach the president, 52 percent, and that only a third of Republicans, 32 percent, thought it would be bad for their political party if it pursued impeachment.
