She is fast becoming the world's favourite style icon (sorry, Duchess of Cambridge), and today Queen Letizia of Spain proved that she can even make a cardigan look high fashion.

The Spanish monarch looked chic and stylish on a visit to the Spanish Design and Innovation Awards in Valladolid with her husband, King Felipe VI of Spain.

Wearing an on-trend burnt orange cardigan and Aztec print skirt, the 41-year-old looked both stylish and regal.

It's already been a busy week for the newly appointed Queen, just yesterday she and her husband met the Pope yesterday.

 Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, wearing white as is standard protocol for a
 queen visiting the pope, were greeted by Francis in the papal library.

Support: The pair looked close as they smiled on arrival at the awards - their second royal engagement already this week

Last week Queen Letizia flaunted a new hairstyle, which gave the appearance of a
 swish bob, at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony held at the Palacio
 de Congresos of Girona in Catalonia.

It wasn't clear whether the glamorous Royal had gone for the chop and cut 
off her luscious locks - or whether she was fooling us with clever 
styling, and had simply twisted her flowing hair under, and pinned it.

Today and yesterday's appearances proves that it was just a nifty stylist trick as she 
showcased her usual flowing caramel hair on a visit to meet Pope Francis
 at the Vatican.

Francis
 had met Felipe's parents, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, on several 
occasions, the last time during the April 27 canonizations of Saints 
John Paul II and John XXIII.  Juan Carlos abdicated earlier this month.

Chic style: Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid

It
 has been a busy few weeks for the 41-year-old. Since becoming Queen she
 has attended numerous public events. She showcased her good taste once 
again last week as she joined 
her husband to attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association
at El Pardo Palace in Madrid. 

For that occasion, she wore tailored navy trousers and a tweed blue jacket.

The
couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain. Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
