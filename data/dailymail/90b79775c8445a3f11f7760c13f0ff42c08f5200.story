They are ranked No 1 and  in the world and the last two winners of the DP World Tour Championship. Now Henrik Stenson and Rory McIlroy are set to give the finest season in the history of European golf a fitting send-off with a heavyweight clash over the weekend.

Day two honours at this year’s edition of the tour’s final event went to defending champion Stenson, who shot a 66 to lead by two shots from McIlroy, who carded a 70, with Scot Richie Ramsay (69) and in-form Danny Willett (67) from England on the same mark.

‘Henrik is very comfortable around this course, and I certainly cannot afford to let him get any further ahead,’ said McIlroy. 

Rory McIlroy struggled to replicate his first round form but still shot a two-under par round of 70

Henrik Stenson shot a six-under par round of 66 to seize the lead by two shots after round two

As for his own round, the Northern Irishman commented:’It was certainly not as good as on Thursday (he shot 66) and that can happen when you haven’t played for a while. But I like my position going into the weekend.’

It’s not only Ramsay and Willett who will be hoping this doesn’t develop into a two-man race to rival the one going on an hour from here on the F1 circuit at Abu Dhabi.

Irishman Shane Lowry, helped considerably by a hole in one at the 13th – he hit a seven iron - is only three behind after a 71 and then there’s Justin Rose.

At four over par for his first ten holes on Thursday, the idea that he could be in a good position to win was fanciful.

The Englishman, however, has shown the pride of a major champion in the 26 holes that have followed to play them in 11 under par and move from dead last to just three adrift.

‘It’s not the first time I’ve made a slow start to a tournament and maybe it’s something I need to look at,’ conceded Rose. ‘I was even four over par early on when I came back to win the US Open. Here there wasn’t a lot of positivity going on walking down the 11th hole after a long season, to be honest, but I probably relaxed and that’s when you often play your best golf.’

Rose finished second here to McIlroy two years ago when he shot a wondrous 62 on the final day, only to come up short as the Northern Irishman concluded with five straight birdies.

With a number of tees moved up, scoring was suitably low on day two. Spaniard Rafael Cabrera-Bello began with five straight birdies on his way to a 64 to join Rose on seven under. Luke Donald and Ian Poulter rebounded from poor first rounds with scores of 66 and 69 respectively.

Rose came to the 18th with seven birdies on his card and an obvious opportunity to make it eight on this par five. The tee had been moved up 90 yards to bring it easily within range of two blows but Rose was caught out, and hit his drive flush into the creek that winds its way menacingly down the hole.

‘I played beautifully to that point and that’s the only shot I’d certainly want back,’ he said. ‘To be honest, when I hit it I thought it was going to be perfect and I was surprised to see it finish in the hazard.’

Asked how he would sum up a year in which he has won on both sides of the Atlantic, was a star at the Ryder Cup, but has fallen from fourth to seventh in the world, Rose replied:’I’d give it a B- or maybe a B because of the Ryder Cup. The thing that has been missing is that I played some good golf in the majors but was never able to do it for four rounds.’

Now he goes in search of the win that, given the calibre of the players ahead of him, might even cause the campaign to be upgraded to a B plus should he pull it off.
