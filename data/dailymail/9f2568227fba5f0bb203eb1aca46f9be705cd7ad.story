Gay marriage will be legal in some British churches by 2014, despite furious Tory warnings that the issue could split the party and cost it the next election.

In a surprise move, the Church of England will be guaranteed a blanket exemption from holding same-sex marriages. But this failed to quell a major Tory backlash.

Amid stormy scenes in the Commons, Equalities Minister Maria Miller vowed to fast-track plans to legalise gay marriage, saying the change was needed to keep the institution of marriage ‘vibrant and relevant to society’.

Scroll down for Maria Miller's statement to the House...

Culture Secretary Maria Miller promised a 'quadruple legal lock' to prevent the Church of England from being forced to hold gay weddings

She confirmed a government U-turn on 
the issue which will allow religious institutions, such as the Quakers, 
that want to conduct gay marriages to ‘opt in’ to the law and hold 
ceremonies in their churches.

But unexpectedly, she announced there 
would be a specific legal ban on the Church of England and Church of 
Wales holding gay weddings.

Mrs Miller said this would give the Church ‘iron-clad’ protection against legal action by gay rights campaigners.

Other religious institutions, such as 
the Catholic Church, will also be allowed to refuse to hold ceremonies 
for same-sex couples, as will individual vicars. Mrs Miller said the 
legislation would include a ‘quadruple lock’, meaning no church will 
ever be forced to conduct a gay wedding unless it wants to. The legal 
protections include:

 - A guarantee that no religious 
organisation or individual minister can be compelled to marry same-sex 
couples or to permit this to happen on their premises.

 -  A legal bar on allowing ministers 
to marry same-sex couples unless their organisation’s governing body has
expressly opted in to provisions for doing so.

 - Amendment of the Equality Act 2010 
to ensure no discrimination claim can be brought against religious 
organisations or individual ministers for refusing to marry a same-sex 
couple.

 - An explicit statement that it will 
be illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry 
same-sex couples and that Canon Law, which bans same-sex weddings, will 
continue to apply.

In the Commons, gay former justice minister Nick Herbert said same-sex marriage was backed by the public, but he was heckled by Tory MP Peter Bone who insisted it is not

Legislation will be published next 
month. Ministers expect it to take up to 12 months to get through 
Parliament, with the first gay marriage ceremonies taking place in early
2014.

But furious Tory MPs warned the 
legislation would undermine the institution of marriage and cost the 
party votes. Andrew Selous, ministerial aide to the Work and Pensions 
Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, warned Mrs Miller that the proposal was 
‘directly contrary to what Jesus said about marriage’.

Former defence minister Gerald Howarth
said ministers had ‘no right whatsoever’ to alter the definition of 
marriage as being the union of one man and one woman.

Fellow Tory Stewart Jackson said the 
Government’s consultation process, which brushed aside a petition 
opposing the move signed by 600,000 people, was a ‘constitutional 
outrage’ and ‘reminiscent of a Liberian presidential election’.

In an open letter to David Cameron 
last night, senior Tory MP Brian Binley warned the issue could split the
party and cost the Conservatives the next election.

Mr Binley said the issue was driving 
supporters away, adding: ‘I am perturbed that our chances of winning the
next election are compromised by the pursuit of issues which serve to 
divide the party, and detach the leadership from its support base in the
country.’

Nigel Farage leader of the UK Independence Party, said the issue would be at the heart of his election campaign.

'David Cameron's proposal has the potential to rip apart the traditional rural Tory vote. While UKIP wholly respects the rights of gay people to have civil partnerships, we feel the prime minister's proposals will present an affront to millions of people in this country for whom this will be the final straw,' he told The Guardian.

'The division between city and rural is absolutely huge. In my village pub in Kent they are just completely against.'

Free vote: Labour leader Ed Miliband has granted Labour Mps a free vote on the issue

All Tory MPs, including ministers, are
to be given a free vote on what Mrs Miller described as an ‘issue of 
conscience’. Privately ministers believe at least 40 per cent of Tory 
MPs oppose the legislation.

In another surprise move, Labour said 
it would give its MPs a free vote. Only Liberal Democrat MPs will be 
whipped to support gay marriage.

But Labour condemned the decision to 
put a legal block on the Church of England. Shadow home secretary Yvette
Cooper said: ‘Why is the Government now rowing backwards on equal 
marriage? Having said churches would be able to hold same-sex marriages 
if they wanted to, they now say it will be illegal for the Church of 
England to do so even if it wants to in future. How can that be freedom 
of religion?’

Speaking on behalf of the Church in 
the House of Lords, the Bishop of Leicester Tim Stephens said: ‘Marriage
is not the property of the Government nor is it the property of the 
Church. While the forms and legalities around marriage have evolved over
time, one fundamental feature has remained the same throughout – that 
marriage is a union of one man and one woman.’

Archbishop Vincent Nichols, the leader
of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and Archbishop Peter
Smith, the Archbishop of Southwark, voiced their opposition in a joint 
statement.

   ‘The meaning of marriage matters,’ 
they said. ‘It derives that meaning from its function as the foundation 
of the family. The union of one man and one woman for love and mutual 
support and open to procreation has over the centuries formed a stable 
unit we call the family.’

Opponents condemned the Government’s consultation on the issue and warned that ministers could face a High Court review.

And veteran human rights campaigner 
Peter Tatchell denounced the exemption for the Church of England and the
Church in Wales as ‘disappointing’, saying it  could be open to legal 
challenge.

He said: ‘Exempting the official 
established Church sends the wrong signal. There is no reason why these 
churches should be treated differently from other faiths. Discriminating
between faith groups is probably illegal under the Human Rights Act.’
