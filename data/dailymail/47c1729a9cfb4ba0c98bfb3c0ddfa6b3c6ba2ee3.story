Nuisance: Almost half of all postal deliveries are junk mail, it was revealed yesterday

Almost half of all postal deliveries are junk mail, it was revealed yesterday.

And Royal Mail admitted the volume of unwanted letters will only grow in its drive to make bigger profits.

The revelation means up to 27million of the 54million items of daily post are junk mail.

The rise is fuelled by the removal a year ago of a cap that stopped postmen delivering more than three unaddressed letters to a house in a week.

This – along with much higher stamp prices – saw Royal Mail report vastly improved operating profits yesterday.

Clyde Loakes, of the Local Government Association, said junk mail was a menace.

‘The LGA has previously raised concerns about the impact of Royal Mail scrapping its limit on unsolicited mail,’ he said.

‘The revelation that half of the postbag is now direct marketing material proves those concerns were not ill founded

‘Most people don’t appreciate being bombarded with junk mail on a daily basis. Not only is it a nuisance to have to pick up and throw away, but it adds thousands of tons to the amount of waste councils have to collect.’

Robert Hammond, of the campaign group Consumer Focus, said: ‘Some consumers may find it frustrating that almost half of mail  received now is direct marketing and that this will be contributing to higher profits.

‘However, the hard fact is that without this revenue stream for Royal Mail and the associated profits, customers could in fact face paying more for their stamps.’

Royal Mail made £144million in the first half of the year compared with only £12million in the same period of 2011.

Around £1billion of its annual revenues come from junk mail.

Moya Greene, Royal Mail’s £1.1million-a-year chief executive, said such ‘direct marketing’ was approaching 50 per cent of all deliveries.

She described herself as a huge fan of the ‘powerful medium’, adding: ‘We are poised to increase our share of it.’

In July, Royal Mail launched Market Reach, which is a one-stop shop for firms that want to use junk mail.

Miss Greene said the service would design postal messages, identify potential addresses, carry out deliveries and deal with responses from customers.

Between March 26 and September 23, Royal Mail delivered a record-breaking 1.6billion items of unsolicited mail to Britain’s 29million addresses.

Junk mail can be reduced by registering with The Mailing Preference Service.

It is free and allows householders to remove their names and addresses from many marketing lists.

You can register on the website www.mpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0845 703 4599.

It also delivered 6.8billion addressed letters – some of which would be junk mail.

The growing profitability of Royal Mail opens up the possibility of it being floated on the stock market or sold off to a rival.

Michael Fallon, Tory business minister, said yesterday: ‘Parliament decided, via the Postal Services Act 2011, to inject private capital into the company in order to secure the future of the universal postal service.

‘The structure and timing remain open, but Government is committed to doing that to ensure the ongoing viability of the company.’ A potential sell-off has been helped by shifting responsibility for Royal Mail’s pension fund to the taxpayer.

Assets of £28.5billion were transferred to the Government along with £37.6billion of liabilities, which are the cost of pension promises to postal workers and its retired staff.

Yesterday’s financial results revealed how the stamp price hike has hit Royal Mail’s letters business, with the number of letter deliveries dropping by 9 per cent.

Miss Greene said however that 50p for a second-class stamp was a bargain.

Insisting she did not mean to be ‘glib or flip’, she added: ‘Realistically, what can you buy for 50p today?’
