Champion: Westlake High School junior Mikayla Clark, pictured, broke the record for most consecutive back handsprings this week

An Atlanta, Georgia cheerleader has set a new Guinness World Record after she did a total of 44 consecutive backflips at her high school homecoming game.

Westlake High School junior Mikayla Clark broke the record of most consecutive back handsprings this week and her dizzying achievement was caught on video.

The previous record was 36 back handsprings in a row, but Mikayla tumbled it out of the gymnasium - or football field rather.

'Most people can say, "Well, I won state, I did this." Now I can say I'm a world record holder,' she told Fox News, adding that she'll always cherish the memory.

The 16-year-old cheer squad leader had been training for the incredible feat since the beginning of the football season.

Mikayla, who has been cheering since she was just four and is a cheerleader for the Georgia All Stars Competition Squad, said she came across the previous record while searching Google one day.

'I was looking at world records and I just happened to see the most consecutive back handsprings,' she said. 'I clicked on the link and I was like, "Oh, she did 36, I think I can beat that."'

Her mother, Erica, didn't believe she was serious at first but her thoughts quickly changed.

'She started at football games and they would do a tumble line,' Erica told Fox.

Dizzying feat: The previous record was 36 back handsprings in a row, but Mikayla, pictured, tumbled it out of the gymnasium - or football field rather with 44 flips

'She started 10, then she started 20 and
one night she got up to 32. I said, "Okay Mikayla, the record is 36 
--you don't have that many more to go."'

Mikayla's mother said she was unbelievably proud of her daughter.

'I don't have the words for it because she said that she was going to do it and she did it,' she said.

Mikayla's impressive gymnastic display lasted a whole 34 seconds.

In the video, her supportive teammates 
can be seen running along beside her, cheering her on as she flips the 
length of the school athletic track.

Hooray: When she comes to a stop having smashed the record, Mikayla, center, is engulfed by a crowd of friends like the world champion she is

By the last few handsprings, Mikayla is clearly tiring, but she finds the energy to keep going a little longer.

When she finally comes to a stop having smashed the record, she is engulfed by a crowd of friends like the world champion she is.

Her coach, Ashley Clark, expects Mikayla's official certificate from Guinness World Records to arrive this week.

But before she even has it in her hand, the 16-year-old cheerleader has already set another goal.

'My senior year, I'm going to flip field goal to field goal and try to break my record,' she said.
