Blissed out beaches; partying under the stars and poolside cocktails. 

The southern most tip of the US may be known for its hedonistic lifestyle, but there's more to it than wild nights out and parading sun-worshippers stretched out in the golden sand. 

Miami is a haven of interconnected oceanfront cities, urban hubs, charming villages and tropical parks. From people-watching on Lincoln Road, South Beach, to getting a caffeine hit at super-hip Panther coffee in Wynwood, find out which zone is most you.

The Miami of postcards; The 'American riviera' is all glamour, glitz and sea spray.

From volleyball on the beach to people-watching on Lincoln Road, this is Miami's number one place to see and be seen. Its ten miles of beach are buzzing with life in all guises from eccentric locals to posing models and A-list celebrities.

But there's more to it than white sands and beautiful people. Along Ocean Drive, rainbow art deco buildings line the shore and tourists snap the impressive Versace Mansion; Washington Avenue bursts with world-class boutiques and restaurants and Espanola Way looks like its straight from a movie set.

Hungry? South Beach has everything from beachside casual to gourmet. Grab a Cuban dinner at Havana 1957, or hit CJ’s Crab Shack or Hosteria Romana for the best lasagne you'll ever taste.

As dusk falls, the lights sparkle and South Beach comes alive; so get your dancing shoes on, the party lasts until the sun comes up.

The walls of Wynwood are a canvas for the world's best street artists.

This uber-hip neighborhood lives and breathes art; Art Basel pop-up parties are held here each year, there are over 70 galleries, museums and collections - as well as hordes of achingly hip boutique shops - and creative types buzz around it like bees to a honeypot.

The Shoreditch of Miami is at the center of a gentrified renaissance. At its heart is The Bakehouse Art Complex, a studio and gallery space for local artists and self-proclaimed incubator for artistic creativity.

And the artistry extends to Wynwood's growing number of excellent eateries. Pride & Joy serves up barbecue, beer, and bourbon or try Kush Wywood for burgers and craft beers.

Panther Coffee is a speciality coffee roaster, serving up cold brew coffee. For something stronger, the Wynwood Brewing Company is Miami's first for locally handcrafted beers. Hit Gramps for live bands, DJs and hardcore Dark and Stormy cocktails.

Once home to tie-die and psychedelia, these days Coconut Grove is all about the outdoors, easy life.

A small, bohemian, laid back village on Biscayne Bay, where residents spend days out on the water and peacocks wander through the streets.

Sail boats, charter boats and paddle boards bob on the shore, and five parks around the bay make it a perfect spot for nature lovers.

No visit is complete without a visit to AC's famous ice truck, for 'icees' and hot dogs with sauerkraut. 

In North Grove, you'll find Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, a gorgeous 1900s European style villa with Italian renaissance gardens and woodlands to explore.

The area is also home to the Barnacle historic state park, the oldest original house in Miami. 

As well as its art – there are over 130 art galleries – the Design District is also a high end shopping Shangri-La. Label lovers can stroll through luxury closet staples like Prada, Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin, as well as one-off boutiques and kooky home décor stores.

In less than ten years, the area has become home to high-brow design and there are plans for yet more growth. 

For luxury, hit En Avance, where you’ll find lingerie, makeup, candles, clothes, jewelry and books. Or go edgy at menswear boutique Apt 606 with brands like Alexander Wang and Helmut Lang.

Whatever you're after, there are more than 55 high-end design stores to peruse.
