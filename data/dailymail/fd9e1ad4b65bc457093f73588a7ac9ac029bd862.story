With property markets heating up across the country, now could be a perfect time to put your house on the market.

New data from realestate.com.au revealed the top 10 suburbs booming the housing market, ranked according to supply and high demands from buyers.

The Top Sellers’ Markets report reveals Parkside, inner southern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia is the hottest state in Australia for sellers.

While South Australia tops the rankings, New South Wales has dominated with six suburbs making the cut.

Georgie Todd from Harris Real Estate in South Australia told realestate.com.au that Parkside is a popular location due to the value it offers and its close proximity to the city, parklands and trendy restaurants and cafes.

‘The average price of properties in Parkside is really affordable at around $600,000 and that gets you a fantastic property in this area,’ she said.

‘Young professionals are buying the smaller, two-bedroom homes which are in high demand. There are also bigger houses in the area to accommodate the family market moving in.'
