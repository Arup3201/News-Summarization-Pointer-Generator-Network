Orlando police have released transcripts of a 911 call made by a furious restaurant manager who found two patrons having sex on the patio in front of horrified parents and children.

Shocked diners lost their appetite when Jeremie Calo and his pretty brunette date Tiffani Barganier, began having sex on a table outside and refused to stop when ordered to by manager, Tom Murphy.

Mr Murphy called the authorities and described Calo's behaviour as 'intoxicated and combative,' before revealing that the man had also vomited all over the ground.

Raunchy: Police have released the 911 tape of the call made by a furious restaurant manager after he allegedly found Jeremie Calo (left) and Tiffani Barganier (right) having sex on a patio table in front of families with kids

According to police he told the 
couple: 'Compose yourself, pay your tab or I'll call the police.'

But outrageous Jeremie Calo claimed his date could not stop as 'she can't get up at this time,' prompting the Baldwin Park restaurant manager to make the call.

He told the operator on duty: 'We
had a patron having sex on the patio and we warned him and told him he 
can't do that. There's kids down the way and patrons complaining. He's 
intoxicated.'

As the operator tried to clarify what was happening he asked: 'So the subject was having sex with a girl and then he tried to run off with some beers?'

Lucky: Manager Tom Murphy called police to the incident where Calo was arrested for fighting with the restaurateur and not paying his bill but the couple avoided being taken in for having sex in public

Another employee took the phone and told him: 'Yeah, well they have a tab here and they were looking to run out on the tab.'

Shortly after, as they waited for a patrol car to show up, the manager revealed that Calo's behaviour had become more violent.

'He's s***faced now and he's being combative,' he said adding to Calo, 'don't touch me.'

When police finally arrived and cuffed Calo for trying to run out on his bar tab, Mr Murphy informed the operator still on the line: 'Now he's throwing up.'

Passers-by told America's Local 6 news they were appalled parents and children had to endure the scenes.

Yuck: Mr Murphy told the police operator that Calo was drunk and aggressive as shocked passers-by called their behaviour 'totally unacceptable and insane'

Ashley Webster said: 'That's ridiculous that they would do that out in public, and also in front of kids.'

Over the road from the bar mum Jackie Kelvington watched her daughter at gymnastics.

She said: 'That's totally unacceptable and insane. I'm shocked. I can't believe that.

'I would absolutely yank my kids, get them away from that situation and hope that they didn't see too much.'

The couple avoided arrest for the sex allegations however because none of the parents wanted to make statements.
