An 11-year-old boy with a rare brain disease has come one step closer to fulfilling his dream of meeting Pirates of the Caribbean character Captain Jack Sparrow.

At the London premier of his latest Hollywood blockbuster, Mortdecai, Johnny Depp was heard wishing Jed Baker, who was diagnosed with Moyamoya, a disease that causes the blood vessels in his brain to constrict, to: 'get well soon, brother.'

When asked if the pirate obsessed fan from Ravenshoe in far north Queensland could come visit his Gold Coast film set for the fifth movie in the series, Depp responded 'Absolutely, it's easy!'.

Captain Jed: An 11-year-old boy who suffers from a rare brain disease, dreams of meeting his idol Johnny Depp  

In a recent red carpet appearance for the blockbuster Mortdecai, Depp issued Jed Baker a 'get better' message and when asked if the boy could visit his Queensland film set, said 'absolutely, it's easy'

Jed's mother Nicola Baker told Daily Mail Australia that her son was so excited by the footage that he 'watched it four times in a row and went into a 'pirate frenzy' so far that I had to draw a mascara moustache on him that he refused to wash off'.

The mother-of-three said her eldest son's love for Captain Sparrow grew during the long hours he spent in hospital recovering from multiple surgeries to treat his rare condition.

At only 11-years-old, Jed has undergone a renal artery bypass and three separate brain surgeries in which four sections of his brain were operated on.

'His prognosis now is that he's palatable - that doesn't mean he's going to die, but it means there are no other surgical interventions they can do,' Ms Baker said.

She said her eldest son's love for the actor grew during his long stint in hospital, recovering from multiple surgeries. Jed repeatedly watched the Pirates of the Caribbean series during his recovery 

'He believes in his mind that he is Jack Sparrow. He has a Black Pearl and he can sit on it and it has Captain Jed written on it,' Ms Baker said

'If he has another bleed or a stroke, then there's a very real chance Jed won't be with us. We are hopeful that he reaches adulthood, but we understand that he might not.'

Jed first suffered a stroke when he was only 11-months-old, sending his parents into panic.

'It was horrible; we didn't know what was going on. He started to twitch down the side of his face and body and it turned into one side of his body having a level of paralysis. His face was droopy, his arm wouldn't work and he could barely walk,' Ms Baker said.

'After another 12 months the twitch happened again and we found out that the brain disease had gotten to his kidneys as well, so he had a double whammy.'

In an effort 'to make every day more awesome' for Jack, who Ms Baker described as a happy boy who laughs daily and loves playing with his dog and pet goat, she began a social media campaign to help her pirate-loving child meet his idol.

'We spent hours watching Jack Sparrow, Jed has always been very fixated on pirates. He believes in his mind that he is Jack Sparrow. He has a Black Pearl and he can sit on it and it has Captain Jed written on it,' Ms Baker said.

'I started the Facebook page because of the announcement that the Pirates franchise was going to be filming two hours away from my house– I try to make magic happen for my kids wherever I can and I thought "his idol is going to be right on my doorstep – I have to grab this opportunity with two hands!".

MS Baker said her son was so excited by the footage that he 'watched it four times in a row and went into a 'pirate frenzy' so far that I had to draw a mascara moustache on him that he refused to wash off'

'Jed's illness is very lonely and isolating for us as family, but also disheartening for friends because there's nothing tangible they can do to help, so I used the group as a way to involve family and friends.'

The group's members have started the hashtag #‎piratejedtomeetpiratejack and have been emailing and tweeting celebrities in an effort to raise awareness for Moyamoya disease and possibly get Jed closer to meeting Depp.

It has attracted the attention of supporters overseas including a man calling himself Tell Tale Turtle, who attends red carpet events to advocate for sick children around the world and managed to get a quick video clip of Depp greeting Jed and wishing him the best for his health.

Most recently, Ms Baker and her social media 'army' have been tweeting the presenters of Channel Ten's show The Project, which will speak to Depp as a guest on Friday night, hoping they'll mention Jed's story to the Hollywood actor.
