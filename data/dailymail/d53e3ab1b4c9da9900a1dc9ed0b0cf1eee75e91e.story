Miss Teen USA California Cassidy Wolf arrives to the Premiere of "Wiener Dog Nationals" at Pacific Theatre at The Grove on June 18, 2013 in Los Angeles, California

A 19-year-old Southern California computer science student pleaded guilty Tuesday to hacking the computers of Miss Teen USA and other women and secretly photographing them with their own webcams.

Jared James Abrahams, of Temecula, answered a series of questions from U.S. District Judge James Selna in an Orange County courtroom, including an explanation of the crimes that were committed.

'I hacked several girls' computers and, using their webcams, took photos of them when they weren't aware,' Abrahams said meekly.

Abrahams pleaded guilty to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access of a computer.

He faces up to 11 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million when he's sentenced in March.

Over the past two years, Abrahams hacked into the computers of at least a dozen women in their late teens or early 20s from various states and countries, including Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf.

The pair attended Great Oaks High School together for four years, 
graduating in 2012.

Court records say he also sent the women anonymous emails telling them he had downloaded nude photos of them.

He told them he would publish the images on social media sites if they didn't send him additional pictures or undress for him. If the women complied, Abrahams promised to destroy the images.

At least two of his victims gave in to his demands, authorities said.

'Did you know you were extorting them when you made these demands?' Selna asked.

'Yes,' Abrahams responded.

Dressed in matching gray pants and shirt with a black jacket, Abrahams told the judge he has autism and has been under treatment for the past 10 years.

He said he was on three medications Tuesday, but he said they wouldn't affect his ability to enter a guilty plea.

Outside court, his attorney Alan Eisner said Abrahams apologizes for his actions. He said the autism played a contributing role in the scheme.

'The social disorder had, certainly, a part in it,' Eisner said. 'Again, I say that not to blame the conduct on anything, not to make an excuse for the conduct, but that's part of the full picture.'

In Wolf's case, Abrahams was able to take nude photos of her without her knowledge, authorities said. He posted a naked photo of Wolf online after she didn't respond to him.

According to an FBI affidavit, Abrahams told Wolf: 'Your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.'

Wolf, also 19 and a graduate of Great Oak High School in Temecula, won the Miss Teen USA crown in August.

She has spoken publicly about the incident, saying she would use her fame to highlight cybercrime.

Abrahams is accused of employing similar hacking tactics used by a Florida man who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year after he broke into the personal online accounts of Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera and other women and posted revealing photos and other material online.

In September, Wolf told the website of NBC's "Today" show that earlier this year she received an anonymous email in which the sender claimed to have stolen images from the camera on her home computer.

The sender of the email threatened to go public with images captured from Wolf's webcam unless she would provide nude pictures of herself, Eimiller said - a crime commonly known as 'sextortion.'

Instead, Wolf went to authorities, and an investigation was launched in March.

A federal complaint filed on Sept. 17 and unsealed Thursday charges Jared James Abrahams with extortion but Eimiller said other charges are possible.

An FBI agent's affidavit, included in the complaint, contends that Abrahams used malicious software to remotely operate webcams to capture nude photos and videos of at least seven women as they changed clothes - some of whom he knew personally and others he found by hacking Facebook pages.

The agent alleged that Abrahams, when interviewed, acknowledged controlling 30 to 40 hacked computers and extorting some women.

Abrahams, a college freshman majoring in computer science, allegedly would use the women's webcams to capture nude images, then send emails threatening to post them on their hacked social media accounts unless they either sent him nude photos, a nude video, or logged onto the Skype video chat service and follow his orders for five minutes.

He allegedly threatened Wolf that unless she heeded his demands, he would release her nude photos 'all over the Internet' and 'your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.'

According to the affidavit, the victims included several women from other countries.

One teenager in Ireland responded to the demands by writing: 'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' according to the court record.

Abrahams allegedly responded: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals. Also age doesn't mean a thing to me!!!'

The girl then allegedly stripped during a Skype session, according to the FBI affidavit. A woman in Canada also stripped, according to the document.

He also allegedly received webcam photographs from women in Southern California, Baltimore and Russia, according to the court document.
