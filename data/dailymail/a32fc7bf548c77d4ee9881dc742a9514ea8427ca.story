Disgraced: Gary Baker, 50, who was fired from the Sacramento PD last December, is accused of raping a 75-year-old grandmother on two occassions

A former veteran Sacramento, California, police officer accused of repeatedly raping an elderly stroke victim has claimed that their sexual encounters were consensual.

Gary Baker, 50, was fired last December after 22 years on the force when it came to light that he had allegedly sexually assaulted an ailing 75-year-old woman suffering from a severe speech impediment.  

Detective Eugene Shim testified during a preliminary hearing Wednesday that initially, Baker had denied even touching the victim, identified in the case only as Jane Doe.

A day after he learned of the allegations against him, Shim said that his former colleague changed his story, saying that he did have two encounters with the woman - both of them consensual.

According to the witness, Baker, now 50, said that at first he unsuccessfully tried to have intercourse with 'Jane Doe,' whom he thought to be only 60 or 65 years old at the time.

He later admitted to performing oral sex on the septuagenarian at her senior living apartment complex, The Sacramento Bee reported.

When questioned about his paramour's unusual speech, Shim responded that the officer told investigators he thought the woman had a foreign accent and a stutter.

Jane Doe suffered a stroke in 2009, which left her with a condition called speech aphasia - a disorder that causes problems with speaking, listening, reading and writing.

Change of heart: Baker, seen next to his attorney last month, initially told police he did not have sex with the victim, but later said the two had consensual sex

Crime scene: The alleged incidents took place in November 2010 and September 2012 inside the elderly woman's senior living apartment complex

Due to her condition, the victim, who is now 78 years old, has been declared incompetent to take the stand and offer testimony against her alleged assailant.

During a hearing last month, Baker's attorney Linda Parisi attempted to use the victim’s disability to poke holes in the prosecution's version of events, suggesting that there was no way for officers who investigated the alleged rape to know if the woman understood the questions they were posing to her.

Officer Paula Gow responded that the elderly woman kept tapping on the police patch on the sleeve of her uniform, apparently indicating that her attacker was a cop, according to a CBS Sacramento report.  

According to the prosecution, Baker raped the woman the first time November 24, 2010, and again September 20, 2012.

He was taken into custody that December after getting caught on a surveillance camera set up by Jane Doe's son entering her home. 

When questioned by police about the allegations, Detective Shim testified that Baker said he and the woman were on good terms, and she even showed him pictures of her family and gave him her phone number.

Asked if his encounters with the septuagenarian were consensual, Baker reportedly answered in the affirmative.

On the day of his arrest December 20, however, the veteran officer was adamant in his denial of any contact with the victim, telling police that he has not even ‘held her hand.'

The prosecution’s case against Baker hinges on DNA and medical evidence suggesting that the woman may have been raped, and also on testimony from the victim’s family.

On Tuesday, her son took the stand, telling the court that his elderly mother had no problem communicating that she had been assaulted.

'She was crying and said "Rape,"' the man recalled.

When asked by her family to describe her attacker, the woman allegedly used the words 'police' and 'black.' Baker is African-American.

The court also heard from Jane Doe's granddaughter, who recalled that when she asked what happened, her grandmother spelled out ‘r-a-p-e.’

‘I said, "Who, who was raped?" She said "Me. I was raped.’ She was pointing at herself,"' the relative told the court.

When the granddaughter examined the elderly woman's body in the bathroom, she said she noticed bruising to her breasts.
