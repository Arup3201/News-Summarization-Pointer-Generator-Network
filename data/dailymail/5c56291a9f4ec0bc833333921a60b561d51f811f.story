A woman allegedly ploughed through a red light, killing a 5-year-old girl and critically injuring her mother and sister, police said.

The suspect, identified by police as 33-year-old Jessica Cowan, was driving through an intersection in Santa Ana, California early Saturday morning at around 60mph, police said.

She was captured in part with the help of a Good Samaritan, who chased her down and blocked off any escape route with her vehicle.
