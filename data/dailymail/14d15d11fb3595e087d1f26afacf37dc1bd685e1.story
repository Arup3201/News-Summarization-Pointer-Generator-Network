Not many people have managed to embarrass Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer during his career.

But a 12-year-old boy left the tennis ace stunned on Tuesday night by beating him with a flawless shot during an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden.   

The young pretender strolled on to the court in jeans and a hoodie and returned a few volleys from Federer before gracefully lobbing the ball over his head to win the game.
