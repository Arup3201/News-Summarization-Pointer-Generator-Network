Comedian and actor Felix Dexter has died from cancer at the age of 52

Celebrities and comedians have paid tribute to star of The Real McCoy comedian Felix Dexter, who died yesterday following a battle with cancer.

The comedian and actor, 52, suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer.

Tributes to the St Kitts-born star have flooded Twitter, recalling his characters, including Nigerian accountant Nathaniel in the 1990s BBC series The Real McCoy.

The Londoner also starred in The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous and was the first black comic to get a regular slot at London's Comedy Store.

Comic Charlie Higson, who starred alongside Dexter in The Fast Show, tweeted: 'Very sad news that the brilliant and criminally underused Felix Dexter has died.

'He was a brilliant character comedian and actor.'

Friend and colleague, BBC Radio 
London presenter Eddie Nestor, told his Up All Night programme that Dexter's terminal illness
 did not get in the way of his sense of humour.

'It's a sad day. It's a really sad day,' Nestor, who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy, said.

'It's quite weird, you're going to see 
somebody being diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself 
laughing, really hard.

'It was great to be able to spend some time with him. (I was) lying with somebody on their death bed and they're still making jokes.'

Nestor said although Dexter was on pain medication, his mind was still sharp and he seemed 'really upbeat'.

'You try to hold it together when you're in there, but when you come out of that room, it's a different gig,' he said.

'We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out.'

Actor David Schneider credits Dexter with creating the funniest character on TV in The Real McCoy, where the St Kitt's-born actor played a Nigerian accountant

BBC's UK comedy production controller Mark Freeland said the comedy community had lost 'a hugely popular, pioneering, naturally funny and thoroughly modest actor and comedian'.

'The outpouring of affection today is testament to a lovely, gracious man, seemingly happy to be in the background, but effortlessly and deservedly very much in the comedy foreground,' Mr Freeland said.

'Many performers will feel today as if they've lost a part of the family.'

DJ and X Factor host Dermot O'Leary 
remembered a 'true gent' while actor Simon Pegg said: 'Very sad to hear 
news of his passing. Very funny man.'

Jack Dee added: 'Very sad news about Felix Dexter.'

While
 Bill Bailey paid tribute to his old friend, tweeting: 'A brilliant 
comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have 
known.'

David 
Schneider, who starred in films 28 Days Later, A Knight's Tale and 
Mission Impossible, credited Dexter with creating the funniest character
 on TV.

He said:' So sad 
about Felix Dexter. Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has 
ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character.'

Matt Lucas remembered 'a brilliant performer, joining the band of celebrities and comedians paying tribute to Dexter

Grumpy Old Women star Jenny Eclair praised Dexter's 'fabulous work'. As well as his comedy characters, Dexter also performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and on the West End stage with Hollywood star Christian Slater

Actor David Morrissey said he had worked with Felix and was sad to hear the news. 'Such a funny, talented and generous man,' he tweeted.

Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote: 'So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip.'

Dexter, who studied law, enjoyed an 
eclectic career also performing for a season with the Royal Shakespeare 
Company as well as securing the accolade of being named Time Out 
comedian of the year.

His website credits his legal background with helping his career in comedy. It reads: 'This legal background is extremely useful in his stand-up comedy career, enabling him to stun hecklers into silence with shouts of 'objection.'

Dexter also enjoyed an appearance on the panel of Have I Got News For You and Grumpy
 Old Men as well as Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge.

As
 an actor he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and took to the stage in
 the West End alongside Hollywood star Christian Slater.

More
 recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show 
Bellamy's People and is currently on screen appearing in sitcom Citizen 
Khan.
