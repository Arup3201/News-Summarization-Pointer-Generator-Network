Supermarkets could be forced to pull copycat products from shelves after a small British food firm won a High Court injunction against the budget chain Aldi.

The German retailer has been forced to remove its ‘Saucy Salmon Fillets’ from sale following complaints from the Saucy Fish Company.

The packaging and product recipes of the Aldi products bear an uncanny resemblance to those made and promoted by the Grimsby based firm.

Aldi is among a number of high street stores who are trying to win sales by copying the pack design, colours and names used by big brands, which spend millions developing and promoting their products.

The interim injunction won by the Saucy Fish Company is a prelude to a full court hearing that could see Aldi forced to pay compensation for effectively stealing the idea.

That could set a precedent that would allow other brands to take on all the big supermarkets which try to boost sales and profits by developing copycat products.

The Saucy Fish Co. sells salmon fillets in a black container with a clear film over the top and a cardboard sleeve with the company name and description of the contents.

One product contains a chilli, lime and ginger dressing, while the other has a watercress and crème fraiche dressing.

The Aldi product looks virtually identical in terms of pack design and the two sauce options, while the bold label describes them as ‘Saucy Salmon Fillets’.

The Saucy Fish Co is a British success story. It was recently voted a CoolBrand and signed a listing with Waitrose earlier this year, while its products will soon be going into stores in the USA.

It is easy to see why Aldi, which is making a concerted effort to attract middle class shoppers, should want to emulate its success.

However, head of brand at the Grimsby fish company, Simon Smith, said: ‘Aldi’s imitation of The Saucy Fish Co. undermines the trust and confidence consumers have built with us. Our brand represents a promise of consistency, not easily replicable by packaging alone. 

‘Originality and innovation are two of our watchwords, built through investment over the last three years as we've nurtured and grown a unique and desired brand, now valued at £35m. It’s really important for us to protect our distinctive brand identity as a mark of premium quality, as we grow our brand globally. 

'’Ghost’ brands that trade on the halo effect of an established brand simply should not be tolerated and I’m sure other brand owners will be watching this case with interest.’

Research by the consumer group Which? found many shoppers are angry at supermarkets who try to mislead them by copying brands.

A study found one in five of its members have accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well-known brand. Of those, 38 per cent said they were annoyed and 30per cent felt misled.

Crunch: Orange packs of Aldi's Belmont Oaties (right) look very much like McVitie's Hobnobs (left)

Its research among 150 own-label products found that the cheeky monkey on boxes of Harvest Morn Choco Rice sold by Aldi could quite easily be mistaken for the character used by Kellogg’s for its Coco Pops. 

Similarly, the orange packs of Aldi’s Savour Bakes Cream Crackers look very much like the Jacob’s product, while its Norpak Spreadable could be mistaken for Lurpak Spreadable. The firm’s Belmont Oaties were also similar to McVitie’s Hobnobs and its Tower Gate Milk Chocolate Digestives look like the McVitie’s product.

Asda has also come under fire for its Puffin brand of chocolate biscuits, which are very similar to the Penguin brand from McVitie’s, while Lidl’s Samson Malt Vinegar could be mistaken for the Sarsons brand.

However, other mainstream stores have also been accused of using the same tactic by Which? and the British Brands Group, which speaks for manufacturers.

Examples include Boots anti-dandruff shampoo, where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to Head & Shoulders. Similarly, Boots vibrant pink bottle for its ‘Fruit Essence’ shampoo is remarkably like the one for Clairol’s popular ‘Herbal Essences’.

Tesco’s tubes of ‘Chipz’ look very much like the market leaders ‘Pringles’, while ‘Beasty Bites’ from Asda appear to owe much to the look of packs of Monster Munch.

Director of the British Brands Group, John Noble, said this is the first time a food company has won an interim injunction in these circumstances.

‘Mimicking the packaging designs of familiar brands is a trick to boost sales. A recent government study shows that shoppers make more mistakes and perceive products to be better quality, and are therefore more likely to buy them, than if the packaging is clearly distinctive,’ he said. 

‘It is extremely rare for Courts to grant interim injunctions so this is a good result for the Saucy Fish Company. The penny is beginning to drop that shoppers are not well served by such copying and the Government is consulting on making consumer protection law more effective in this area.

‘This would be good news. Such copying free-rides off brand reputations and does not offer shoppers real choice. Products should compete on their own merits and not mislead shoppers or act as parasites on brands.’

Aldi’s Giles Hurley, who is managing director of corporate buying, confirmed an interim injunction had been implemented, but he said the firm had planned to remove the product from sale. He said the injunction was under review and no final decision had been made by the court as to whether it had wrongly or unfairly copied the product.

He said: ‘This matter refers to a product that was being trialled in our stores and which has since reached the natural end of the trial period. It is important to note that no decision has been made regarding the upholding of the injunction.’
