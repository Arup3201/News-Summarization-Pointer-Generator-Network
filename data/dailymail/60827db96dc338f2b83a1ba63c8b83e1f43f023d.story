With Manchester United's short-lived revival well and truly over, rival fans came out in force to mock Louis van Gaal's side - many of them on social media sites.

A calamitous performance against Leicester City saw them concede four goals in just over 20 minutes - transforming United's 3-1 lead into a 5-3 loss.

It was the first time in Premier League history that Manchester United have surrendered a two-goal lead and lost - not even David Moyes managed that!

Fans from around the internet, as well as Liverpool forward Mario Balotelli, were out in force to troll Louis van Gaal's side.
