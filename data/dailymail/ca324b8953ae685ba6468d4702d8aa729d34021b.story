The biggest culture shock to have impressed itself upon Mesut Ozil during his first season in English football has been that no side ever gives up.

A Â£42million signing from Real Madrid in September, the Arsenal playmaker has found life in the Premier League tough going thus far.

Ozil is expected to flourish in his second year since the switch. But the German claims he is still getting used to the intensity of competition, which is in stark contrast what that he witnessed in Spain.

Shock to the system! Mesut Ozil can't believe how much harder smaller teams fight in England than in Spain

Bit of a struggle: Ozil has found life in the Premier League tough going during his debut season over here

'We had many matches. The pace was massive. The matches were exhausting. Always forward and backwards,' he said.

'Even against the smaller clubs even if it was 3-0. In Spain, the opponents stopped fighting when it was 2-0.'

Arsene Wenger's side go into Saturday's FA Cup final against Hull City as overwhelming favourites, but Ozil's words serve as a warning if they are to end a nine-year trophy drought.

The Tigers have been solid since their promotion to the top flight this year and comfortably avoided relegation.

And recent memories of the penalty shoot-out semi-final win against Championship outfit Wigan should act as motivation to get the job done quickly.

'It will be a tough game,' Ozil added. 'Hull fight until the end. Nowhere else than in England are there so many teams who never give up.'
