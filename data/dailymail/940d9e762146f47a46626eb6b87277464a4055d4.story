He once ran a broadcasting empire with  a staff of 20,000 and a £3billion-a-year budget, creating some of the most admired programmes in the world.

But former BBC Director General George Entwistle has now embraced a more humble role - holding the microphone during the filming of a four-minute arts video.

He was spotted last week performing the task of boom microphone operator for the video previewing an exhibition on French artist Henri Matisse at London’s Tate Modern.

Mr Entwistle, who was forced to step down as Director General after just  54 days at the height of the Jimmy Savile scandal - he walked away with a £450,000 payoff - was the executive producer of the short film made for the Art Fund, which raises money to save paintings for the nation.

But as presenter Jacky Klein, an art historian, interviewed Tate director  Sir Nicholas Serota about the exhibition, Mr Entwistle pointed the microphone in Sir Nicholas’s direction.

He told one surprised onlooker: ‘I’m supervising a film for a friend of mine.’
