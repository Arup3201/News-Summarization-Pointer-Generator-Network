Heart-breaking: Zane was diagnosed when he was one

The parents of a young boy with a deadly and extremely rare brain condition are trying to raise £5,000 so that he can have crucial treatment in America.

Little Zane Smith, who is four, suffers from CCM3, which causes cavernomas, or oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or seizures.

Zane has already had one stroke and is likely to have more, so his parents want to fly him to America to see the world authority on the disorder. 

Dr Issam Awad runs a highly-rated clinic in Chicago that offers specialised MRI scans to assess the permeability, or leakiness, of the blood vessels.

He is an authority on the rare genetic mutation that is known to affect fewer than 100 people in the world.

Zane lives in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with his parents Kim, 38, Lee, 39, and sisters Keira, 15, and Lily, eight.

His family is now campaigning to raise the money needed to fly him to Chicago for treatment for the condition that was diagnosed shortly after Zane's first birthday.

Mr Smith said: 'Last night he was sobbing because of a pain in his leg due to his condition.

'Sometimes he says "My head hurts now, let's go to the doctors".

'That's totally heartbreaking for us all.'

There is no known cure for the genetic condition that could kill Zane at any time.  Treatment at Dr Awad's clinic offers Zane the best chance of living as long as possible.

Mrs Smith said: 'Zane needs to be watched constantly as the condition affects his balance, his body movement, and his behaviour.

'I call it the Jekyll and Hyde condition - one moment he can be fine and happy, the next Zane has turned into a monster.

Fund-raising: Lee Smith need to raise £5,000 to take his son to see the world authority in CCM3

'On Saturday night we were at some friends being fairly active and then he came over to me to say his head hurt and within seconds he was asleep.

'Zane can be randomly sick, have no energy at all, and lie on the sofa.  Next minute, he can be all right and active.'

The condition is caused by a mutation on the CCM3 gene, and was only identified in 2005.

It means that Zane can be vacant, twitch, and suffer from pains caused by the multiple cavernomas, or clusters of blood vessels, micro-haemorrhaging.

Mrs Smith said: 'The importance of the scan is that we can manage Zane's condition when things are not going well.

So brave: Little Zane Smith, left, has had brain scans here, right, but needs to fly to the US for specialised help

'The type of MRI used is not available in the UK.  It will show where the cavernomas are, how likely they are to haemorrhage, and what the side-effects of the bleeds could be.

'It means that if Zane had a stroke the doctors could tell fairly quickly which of the cavernomas had haemorrhaged.'

Zane's father said the boy has a 50 per cent chance of having a major stroke before he reaches 15.

If he flies to Chicago to be seen by Dr Awad, his doctors in the UK would then be able to call on the US doctor's expertise at any time.

A scan taken at Hinchingbrooke Hospital when Zane was first diagnosed highlighted 15 cavernomas in his brain, and further tests last year showed two more had developed.

Fifty per cent of patients with the condition begin having brain haemorrhages as children, and Zane falls into this category.

Connie Lee founded the Angioma Alliance, which established the clinic in Chicago that has offered anyone suffering from CCM3 to have a scan and consultation.

Dr Lee said: 'Very little is known about CCM3 - the gene was discovered as recently as 2005 and the fact that this is an ultra-rare disorder was not clear until 2011.

'Because of this, the medical community is not familiar with management of the illness.'

She added: 'Zane has already had a brain haemorrhage.  He has at least 17 brain lesions and this number is expected to increase.

'Hence the need for Dr Awad's expert management.'

Mr and Mrs Smith and their daughters are trying to raise funds through bag-packing, skydiving, a football match and an autumn ball.

They have set up a Just Giving page to encourage people to donate so they can raise enough to pay for them to take Zane to Chicago.

The £5,000 target will pay for flights, accommodation, the scan and a consultation with Dr Awad.  If more than £5,000 is raised, the surplus will go to the charity Cavernoma Alliance UK.

Supporters who would like to get behind Zane and his parents are invited to make donations at www.justgiving.com/helpzane
