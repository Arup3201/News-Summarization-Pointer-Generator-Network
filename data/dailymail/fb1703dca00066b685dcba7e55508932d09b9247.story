The first known instance of creatures growing their own 'disposable penises' has been discovered by researchers after studying the mating habits of sea slugs.

Researchers in Japan were astonished when they realised that a group of sea slugs called Chromodoris reticulata would lose their penises after sex but then grow another one a few hours later.

Marine invertebrate expert Bernard Picton, of National Museums Northern Ireland, said: 'I've never seen anything like this before.'

Impressive equipment: The Chromodoris reticulata, or sea slug, can grow a new penis after having sex

The creatures, also known as nudibranchs, are hermaphrodites, and scientists already knew that they had male and female organs which enable them to perform the male role of donating sperm and the female role of receiving sperm at the same time.

But the revelation that their penises fell off and then re-grew was a surprise to them.

The discovery was made after a team from Osaka City University and Tokyo's Nihon University went diving to collect the sea slugs from shallow coral reefs off the coast near Okinawa.

They placed the slugs together in aquaria in pairs and then observed them having sex.  Scientists noticed that those who had recently mated were unable to do so again within 24 hours.

Looking more closely, they saw that after having sex, the creatures detached themselves from their partner then crawled away with their penises dragging along behind them.  About 20 minutes later, the used penis would fall off.

Examination of the creatures' anatomy revealed a tightly coiled spiral inside the slug's body that would be missing in creatures that had not recently had sex.

It works both ways: The hermaphroditic sea slugs can both impregnate and be impregnated at the same time

Ayami Sekizawa, who led the study, said: 'We think this spiral is effectively a penis-in-waiting that will uncoil rapidly after penis disposal and grow into a new penis.'

Why the creatures have such equipment is not yet known for sure, although the discovery that the discarded penises had backwards-facing spines on them suggested to the experts that perhaps they were there to remove rival sperm left after the partner's previous matings.

Nils Anthes, an evolutionary ecologist from the German University of Tubingen, said that the penis might be discarded after sex to ensure a clean pairing next time.

'If genetic work confirms that the penis spines are really loaded with rival sperm after retraction, then it is best for the animals to dispose of the penis like a dirty syringe,' he told Nature.com.

'Otherwise they may risk delivering some rival sperm mixed with their own during later sexual encounters.'

The slugs were observed to be able to mate at most three times, with 24 hours' recovery time between each copulation, during which a new appendage would grow.

Other creatures are known to lose their penises after sex, including orb weaving spiders, periwinkles and land slugs.

But scientists say that these sea slugs, which are found in the Pacific Ocean, are the only known ones who can re-grow their male equipment according to the BBC.

The findings of the Japanese study are published in the Royal Society's journal Biology Letters.
