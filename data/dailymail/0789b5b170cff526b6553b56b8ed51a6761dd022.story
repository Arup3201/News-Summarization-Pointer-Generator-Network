Getting arrested on shoplifting charges is no laughing matter, but a pair of friends from Florida have found something to smile about while posing for their booking photos.

Cassandra Brown, 22, and Stephanie Brown, 23, were collared by police Thursday after being caught stuffing merchandise into their purses at the Ocala Wal-mart.

According to police, after the two suspected thieves were ushered into the backseat of a squad car, they burst into a fit of giggles and continued sniggering the whole way to jail.

Say, 'felony'! Cassandra Brown (left), 22, and Stephanie Brown (right), 23, were all smiles when posing for their booking photos following an arrest on shoplifting charges 

Shopping spree: The two women were caught trying to carry out more than $300 in merchandise stolen from a Florida Walmart 

The arrest took place at around 16.30pm Thursday after the happy-go-lucky duo allegedly tried to leave the premises of the Wal-mart on Southwest 19th Avenue Road.

Cassandra and Stephanie were stopped at the door by a loss prevention officer who allegedly discovered $313.30 worth of stolen items inside the women's bags.

According to an arrest report cited by WKMG, Cassandra Brown at one point made an unprompted confession to the crime and explained her strange reaction to the arrest.

The 22-year-old Ocala woman told police that she and her friend 'were not trying to be rude or come off as if they didn't care, but that they stole and now they were in trouble so there was nothing else to do other than laugh.'

Not her first rodeo: Stephanie Brown seemed to be in equally good mood after her arrest back in August on a misdemeanor charge

The grinning duo have been charged with felony grand theft and booked into Marion County Jail on $2,000 bail.

This was not the first time that Cassandra Brown appeared in a booking photo grinning from ear to ear.

She seemed to be in an equally good mood after her arrest back in August on a misdemeanor charge of leaving the scene of a crash involving damage to property.
