Killed: Gemma McCluskie was murdered and her body left in Regent's Canal in London

The brother of EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie was tonight charged with murder after her headless body was found dumped in a canal just hours after she attended a hospital opening ceremony.

The limbless torso, found in the Regent's Canal in Hackney, East London, was confirmed to be that of the 29-year-old today.

Police divers are still searching for Miss McCluskie's remaining body parts.

This afternoon her brother Tony was charged with murder and will appear at Thames Magistrates' Court on Monday.

The 35-year-old was arrested on Wednesday when officers raided the East London home they shared with their mother.

Miss McCluskie was reported missing to police two days after she disappeared.

Her body was found on Tuesday afternoon when a member of the public reported a suspicious object floating close to Hackney's famous Broadway Market near her home.

A distinctive tattoo led detectives to believe the body might be that of the former soap star.

Officers have this week been reviewing 
CCTV footage of her attending the opening of the £650million Royal 
London Hospital, in Whitechapel, East London, shortly before her 
disappearance on Thursday, February 29.

The actress, who played Kerry Skinner in EastEnders, was pictured at the hospital
 event wearing a yellow long-sleeved blouse with a round neck, and 
navy-blue leggings. She was also carrying a two-toned Louis Vuitton bag 
with beige handles.

Miss McCluskie appeared in more than 30 episodes of the BBC soap opera as teenage temptress Kerry Skinner in 2001.

The part was her only high-profile 
acting role and it is thought more recently she may have been acting as a
 carer for her elderly mother, who lived with her and her ex-builder 
brother.

Former EastEnders co-stars Natalie Cassidy and Brooke Kinsella both appealed on Twitter for help in finding her.

Their
 £280,000 maisonette in Bethnal Green was last night sealed off and was 
being searched by forensics officers. They also towed away the family's 
2009 VW Polo overnight for tests.

Earlier this week neighbours said they were stunned by 
the developments.

Margaret O’Carroll, who lives two doors away, said 
news of the body being found could ‘kill’ Miss McCluskie’s mother, 
Pauline, who is currently in hospital suffering from a tumour.

She said the 56-year-old had been ill for several years and walked with the
 aid of sticks.

‘I don’t know what Pauline would do 
without Gemma,’ she added.

‘Gemma used to take her mum everywhere in her 
car. The whole family are quite pleasant.

'She lived here with her mum 
and her brother Tony.’

She was in hospital before Gemma's 
disappearance and neighbours fear the recent revelations will have an 
even greater impact on her health.

A
 neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Their mother is very 
sick with brain cancer. She is in and out of hospital but was back in 
when Gemma disappeared.

'I can't think what this will do to her, it is absolutely sad, so surreal it is happening.'

Tony McCluskie led police on 'a wild goose chase' following the discovery of his sister's body, the court heard

Neighbour
 of 20 years John, who did not wish to reveal his full name, described 
Miss McCluskie as a ‘happy-go-lucky girl’ who had never boasted about 
her TV past.

More than 100 people, including Miss 
McCluskie’s second brother Danny, mounted a high-profile search, which 
former EastEnders stars Martine McCutcheon and Brooke Kinsella helped to
 promote on Twitter.

Two bouquets were left close to where the body was found. One note read: ‘Gemma, we will miss you always.
