Manchester United have banned two fans from going to away games indefinitely - one of them for as little as having a single can of lager found in his bag on the way in to a game.

Jamie Bazley was stopped on the way in to St James’ Park earlier this month and given a police caution, simply because he had an unopened can of Stella Artois in his bag.

As if that wasn’t enough, the club have now given him a ban from all domestic and European away games.

'Banned indefinitely' - the letter from Manchester United. An almost identical one was sent to both men

A letter, sent to the fan by Manchester United, said: ‘We have been informed by the Police that you were arrested at the above game and subsequently cautioned for possession of alcohol on entry.

‘The club has worked extensively with the FA, the Police and a number of local authorities to ensure our supporters are treated fairly and safely when supporting the Club at away grounds. This process is also linked to the allocation of tickets given to us as the away support.

‘People who breach these safety measures are jeopardising our ticket allocations for future matches.

‘As a result you will be banned from attending domestic and European away matches indefinitely.’

Bazley says he did not even know he had the alcohol on him, as it was at the bottom of the bag he was carrying. He claimed on Twitter that he ‘honestly thought I had drank [it] on the train’.

Fanning the flames: The incident has led to outrage among Manchester United supporters on Twitter

The life-long fan hit out at the club, and says he may even stop going to home games, although his ban is only from away grounds.

However, the men were allowed to renew their season tickets and will be permitted to attend home games.

Like most football clubs Newcastle United do not allow anyone to bring alcohol into the ground or to drink in the stands - although there is a famous video of Magpies owner Mike Ashley necking a pint at the Emirates Stadium (below), where it is also illegal.

This is not an isolated incident involving United. Another fan, Tom Molyneux has been given an identical ban for being arrested at the same match.

Molyneux, 22, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, told MailOnline: 'I forgot I had a hip flask when entering the ground, and got arrested for it. I was released without charge three hours later, and thought that was the end of it.

'I renewed my season ticket yesterday morning as well, and they spoke to me like nothing had happened, then I got home from work and the letter was waiting for me, no first strike or nothing just a straight ban for ever.

'The club doesn't care about the supporters, just the money'.

Both fans are planning to appeal in an attempt to overturn the bans.

The club have taken the action as what fans do could have a negative effect on United's ticket allocation for future matches.
