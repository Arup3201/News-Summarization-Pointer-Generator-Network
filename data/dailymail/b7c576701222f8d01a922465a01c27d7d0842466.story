Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic led their club sides to the Champions League and Europa League titles this season.

Luiz Gustavo and Paulinho, meanwhile, performed averagely for German and English teams that finished fifth and sixth in their respective leagues.

Despite Croatia’s brilliant central-midfield pairing, few believe they have a hope of beating Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup in Sao Paulo this evening.

Anything but a Brazil win might be unexpected, but it is certainly not out of the question. 

Below, Sportsmail takes a look at why Croatia might ruin the party tonight…

SERBIA

Croatia produced one of their best performances in years when they beat Serbia 2-0 last year and, though their form dropped after that result, the appointment of former player Niko Kovac has reinvigorated the squad.

Brazil, meanwhile, struggled against the same opponents last week, labouring to a 1-0 win courtesy of a second-half goal from Fred.

A disciplined Serbia side lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation that frustrated Neymar et al, prompting jeers from Brazil fans at half-time and the final whistle.

Kovac will have learned from the way Serbia stifled Brazil in midfield and how they tried to exploit the gaps left by Neymar and Hulk when Brazil were not in possession.

Delivery: Crosses from Croatia full-backs Danijel Pranjic (left) and Darijo Srna (right) can cause Brazil problems

Primed and ready: Even without the suspended Mario Mandzukic (second left) Croatia will be dangerous

ON A WING AND A PRAYER

In Darijo Srna and Danijel Pranjic Croatia have two players capable of sending dangerous crosses into the Brazil box.

With Dani Alves and Marcelo often caught high up the pitch, and Neymar and Hulk prone to neglecting their defensive duties, the two experienced full-backs could have some joy on the counter-attack.

Mastermind: Croatia coach Niko Kovac hopes to tactically outsmart Brazil and spoil the party in Sao Paulo

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH LUKA

Rakitic, who had a sensational season in midfield for Sevilla, will be key to the success of Croatia’s counter-attacking.

The 26-year-old can break at speed with the ball at his feet and he knows exactly when to keep it and when to thread it through to a team-mate.

Sevilla’s second goal in their 2-1 win over Real Madrid in March is a perfect example of just how good he is at this.

He and Modric are very good at shielding the ball so Croatia can expect to see their fair share of possession at the Estadio de Sao Paulo.

Holy trinity: Croatia's Mateo Kovacic (right) will likely join Modric and Rakitic in central midfield

And there is a high chance they might be joined in the centre of the pitch by a third playmaker, the Inter Milan prodigy Mateo Kovacic.

The 20-year-old was superb in that win over Serbia last year and Kovac has opted to field him in the same team as Rakitic and Modric whenever possible since then.

The absence of striker Mario Mandzukic through suspension is a big loss to Kovac’s side, but in Modric, Rakitic and Kovacic he has three players capable of creating chances for whichever striker replaces the Bayern Munich man, be it Eduardo, Ivica Olic or Nikica Jelavic.

Pride and passion: Former Arsenal striker Eduardo would love to score against the country of his birth

Prolific: Eduardo has scored 29 goals in 63 internationals for Croatia and could be the difference tonight

HOMECOMING

Oh how Eduardo would love to score the winner for Croatia.

The 31-year-old grew up in Brazil but spent much of the early years of his career in Croatia with Dinamo Zagreb before moving to Arsenal in 2007.

The striker has said he will sing both national anthems before the game but as soon as the whistle goes he will be focused on denting Brazil’s trophy aspirations, as part of Croatia’s starting 11 or if he is introduced from the bench. 

Eduardo has an impressive strike-rate for Croatia, having scored 29 goals in 63 appearances since making his international a decade ago.

Reject: QPR banished Julio Cesar out on loan to Toronto in February but he is Brazil's number one

Weak link: Croatia can exploit the fact Cesar has played very little football and is on poor form

BRAZIL ARE PLAYING A QPR REJECT

Deemed surplus to requirements by Harry Redknapp at QPR in February, Julio Cesar had to move to Toronto to get first-team football ahead of the World Cup, once Luiz Felipe Scolari told him he would not consider him for the squad unless he was playing every week.

Cesar conceded nine goals in seven games for Toronto, keeping just two clean sheets during that spell. Croatia’s more attack-minded players would be crazy not to test the 34-year-old whenever possible.

Pressure: The Brazilian nation expect Brazil to win and they will rely heavily on Neymar (pictured)

Hype: Neymar has been billed as the poster boy of the Brazil World Cup and he will need to deliver

GREAT EXPECTATIONS

Ahead of the 1950 World Cup final the Brazilian newspaper O Mundo printed an early edition of the next day’s paper with a photograph of the Brazil team on the front and a caption that read: ‘These are the world champions’. 

The captain of their opponents Uruguay bought as many issues of the paper as he could and plastered them on his bathroom floor before encouraging his team-mates to urinate on them. 

Hours later it was Uruguay that were champions of the world, having beaten Brazil 2-1 on their own soil.

Expectations: Luis Felipe Scolari managed Brazil to glory in 2002 and hopes to do so again in 2014

Complacency has got the better of them before. 

The whole world will be watching Brazil tonight, expecting them to win comfortably.

There is huge pressure on Scolari and his squad to succeed where the 1950 squad fell short, by winning a World Cup in Brazil.

Neymar, in particular, as the poster boy of the World Cup, appears to be carrying the expectations of a nation on his slight shoulders. 

Over to you kid.
