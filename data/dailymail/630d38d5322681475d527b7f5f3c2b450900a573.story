A father-of-three's comical advert for his pushchair has become an online sensation after he described it as a vomit-stained 'green albatross around my neck' that ruined his life.

Joel Andresier, 39, from Southampton, Hampshire, told the auction site's users he never wanted children and the stroller had come to represent everything he hated about being a family man.

Now the Phil and Teds Explorer, which costs £400 new, is selling for £154,000 after a flurry of presumably fake bids - and with eight days to go, the price keeps rising.

His wife, 36-year-old vet Susan, said she was astounded at the attention and the couple had only wanted to clear out their garage.

'It ruined my life': This eBay advert for a children's pushchair is a web hit - attracting bids of more than £150,000 with eight days still to go - after the seller called it a vomit-stained 'green albatross around my neck'

It's only a joke! Mr Andresier's wife Susan, pictured with him on their wedding day, said: 'Despite what he said in the description he is a good dad and loves his children - well at least he makes out he does!'

His wife said: 'Despite what he said in the description he is a good dad and loves his children - well at least he makes out he does!

'He is like any other parent - quite tired all the time, but we wouldn't have it any other way.' 

The couple's children are aged seven, six and four and are now too old for the buggy, which was 'taking up room in the garage', she said. 

So Mr Andresier, a dealer development manager for the charity Motability, placed the item on the auction site last night and immediately became an online sensation.

'This buggy was purchased against my wishes many years ago as I never wanted any children,' he wrote under the name ukjoel25.

'I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy. My dad once bought a house that cost less than this buggy.

'During its lifetime its had pretty much every bodily fluid known to science, and several that have yet to be discovered, chucked over it by my children.

'It's also absorbed its own weight in Ellas Kitchen meals and mud.' 

Messy: Seller Joel Andresier, 39, joked the buggy had seen contact with every bodily fluid known to science

'I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy', he wrote. 'My dad once bought a house that cost less'

Photographs on the auction site show the buggy is indeed well-used and stained with dirt - but the seller insisted any parents who claim to have immaculate prams are 'liars and scoundrels'.

The item is pick-up only from the seller's detached house in Southampton, and there has been no shortage of offers.

Some have genuinely asked about the item's condition or part exchanges, while others have triggered witty ripostes in their attempt to troll Joel.

'If as stated you didn't want children then why did you proceed to impregnate your wife a second and third time?', asked one potential buyer.

'Because my wife's rather yummy and I find her irresistible,' he replied. 

'Will this vehicle safely transport a pinball machine?' asked another user.

Joel wrote: 'To be fair it never used to safely transport my children, but I learnt that with enough gaffer tape and cable ties it can do pretty much anything.' 

Mr Andresier's wife Susan also laughed off the publicity. 'We bought the buggy when we had our second child so it's not like I trapped him into having ten children,' she said.

Happy family: Mrs Andresier, a vet, and the couple's Labrador - both of whom feature in the advert

'When you first meet Joel he comes across as quiet person, but  he has a very dry sense of humour,' she said

'When you first meet Joel he comes across as quiet person, but once you get to know him you realise that he has a very dry sense of humour.

'He often writes funny things and they always make me laugh.

'I didn't know that he was going to advertise the pushchair on eBay and it is only when a friend alerted me to it that I saw how popular the post was.

'I didn't think much of the advert. I just thought it was Joel being his usual funny self. Joel is bemused by the whole thing and just thinks it's a bit of a laugh.' 

She added: 'It would be lovely to have that money but we know we're not going to get it so its not worth thinking about it. All I want is it for to be out of my garage to create a bit more space.' 

Even if Mr Andresier receives the promised sum for his buggy it won't be the most unusual sale on eBay - or the most profitable for a small item.

Description: The listing on eBay was quickly shared on Twitter and picked up joke bids topping £150,000

Sense of humour: It didn't stop with the listing - the father answered several questions from his new fans

Last year a dress made entirely from loom bands by 42-year-old Helen Smith, from Prestatyn, North Wales, sold for a reputed £170,000 after attracting more than 100 bids.

And a decade ago a toasted cheese sandwich said to bear an image of the Virgin Mary sold for £18,000 to online casino goldenpalace.com.

It must have been worth its weight in gold; it was already a decade old by the time of the sale, and its owner claimed it had never gone mouldy.

But the danger of fake bids always looms large on the auction site.

One of the drills used to bore the Channel Tunnel fetched bids of £5million when it was auctioned for charity in 2004 - only for the final selling price to be a more modest £39,999.

Here we have for sale the green monster that can only be Phil and Teds. I shall be glad to see it leave my premises and never return.

This was purchased against my wishes many years ago as I never wanted any children and a buggy signified my wife's intent to have children. We argued much and this buggy signifies everything that ended my happy carefree low cost child free life.

This buggy clearly meant she intended to have not just one but multiple children and the extortionate price of this buggy will stay imprinted on my brain till the day I die. I have bought cars that cost less than this buggy. My dad once bought a house that cost less than this buggy.

Anyway as you can tell I hate the buggy. I now have three children, and a Labrador and am forced to endure the school run where women I don't know try and discuss the price of Center Parcs holidays, and the benefits of the micro over the mini micro scooter. To summarise my life is over and this green albatross needs to go round some other poor sod's neck.

On the positive none of my three children were stupidly fat, but it's been driven by my wife a lot so not all good. During its lifetime it's had pretty much every bodily fluid known to science, and several that have yet to be discovered, chucked over it by my children. It's also absorbed its own weight in Ellas Kitchen meals and mud.

I have tried to maintain this item as best I could and the wheels were filled with green slime to prevent punctures, and WD40 has been used with gusto on the relevant parts. It even comes with what I lovingly refer to as the Cinderella attachment for the second child you have but don't love as much as the first. It means they can sit but cant see anything, and have a ride that's about as comfortable as a Ford Model T.

All of my children are now walking (often in completely the wrong direction) but someone else deserves to give this a good home. Over the years I have collected spare bits from other zombified fathers who were once full of life and I will throw these in as well.

According to the other half she has the baby carry item that came with this and the pannier bags (whatever they are) but she never used them and they are immaculate and will be listed when she conquers her fear of heights and gets into the loft.

This buggy has never been used for dog sledding, racing, or buggy bumper cars, although I once used it to concuss a randy Alsatian that tried getting amorous with my lab.

There are many adverts on here for immaculate models and these people are all liars and scoundrels as nothing that comes into contact with a young child is ever immaculate.

So for a starting price of just £9.99 you too can screw up your life. There are programs for those of you who need to recover from drugs or alcohol. Any money generated from this sale will be used to help me recover from children (and probably involve drugs and alchohol)

So spend big - its for a good cause.
