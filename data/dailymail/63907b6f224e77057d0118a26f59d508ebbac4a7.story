A 93-year-old former Prisoner of War was separated from his wife for seven months after a mix-up over accommodation at a care home left them living miles apart.

Gerry Sinclair hadn't spent a night away from wife Kate, 90, since the end of the Second World War 68 years ago during which he was detained at a Stalag concentration camp in occupied Poland.

But when Mrs Sinclair discharged herself from their Bucklow Manor nursing home in Knutsford, Cheshire, her husband wasn't in a fit enough state to follow.

Together again: Kate and Gerry Sinclair reunited at Tabley Care Home in Knutsford. The couple hadn't spent a night apart until a mix-up at the Cheshire care home they were living in

Mrs Sinclair tried to return but her place had been taken. It meant the couple, who met during the war, had to live apart.

That was until their family enlisted the help of Soldiers' charity SSAFA Forces Help and the couple's favourite team Manchester City which raised money to help pay for the couple to be reunited under the same roof.

Now Mr and Mrs Sinclair from Knutsford, Cheshire, have been transferred to the Tabley Nursing Home and are back together again.

Mrs Sinclair, who has three great grandchildren, said: 'It has been very tough not living in the same care home but our friends and family have been so kind and worked so hard for us.

'Gerry and I have been through 
everything together and we had not been parted since the war.

'I remember
conditions at the POW camp were awful, no proper food, clothes and he 
had lost so much weight that it was like Belsen.

'When
I went to see him he was so thin and wearing an American uniform that I
didn't recognise him.

'He had to carry a cushion round with him to make 
him look heavier than he actually was. From then on I vowed he would 
never go hungry again.

'I got him fit and every night I fed him meat and vegetables. Since the war we've been utterly devoted to each other and it was hell when we split up - although we don't blame the care home. We are just so happy to be back together.'

Mr and Mrs Sinclair met at a dance in Leicester in 1942. Gerry who trained paratrooopers was stationed there with the Royal Signals and Kate worked in the land army.

During the Second World War Mr Sinclair saw active service across Europe and fought as a Desert Rat in North Africa.

He fought in the Battle of Alamein where 100 tanks went out and the Germans wiped them all out but seven.

After that he was sent to 6th Airborne Division Parachute Regiment and trained to jump.

He himself trained a group of Polish airmen to jump over Tatton Park in Cheshire and they dropped with him at the Battle of Arnhem

As dozens of his colleagues were shot down Mr Sinclair landed and hid under a dead airman as the Germans walked by, then he heard the click, all clear Germans gone.

He then fought in Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in a battle recreated in the 1977 film A Bridge Too Far.

When captured he was forced to leave all belongings behind, including a photograph of his then-girlfriend Kate, before he was marched 450 miles to Stalag VIII C, Sagan in Poland.

Mr Sinclair kept notes of the great trek and still keeps the two very worn sheets written in pencil with how far they had marched each day.

They walked with very little food, hardly any clothing and were covered in lice when they arrived. On arrival at Stalag he discovered someone had found his photo and pinned it up on the door of one of the cells.

Mr Sinclair saw it and said 'that's my girl' - something he still says today when he sees that picture. Mr Sinclair was taken prisoner in September 1944 and liberated by the Americans in April 1945.

They married in August 1945 - the 
first time the church bells had rung since the war - and moved to 
Manchester, Mr Sinclair was a civil servant. Kate worked at the former 
Manchester Guardian newspaper as a copy taker.

The
couple never spent a day apart and in their later years they went into a
care home in Knutsford but Mrs Sinclair disliked it so much she 
discharged herself and assumed her husband would be discharged along 
with her.

But Mr Sinclair who now suffers from dementia and needs round-the-clock care had to remain at the care home.

Family friend Linda Holmes said: 'They were both in care at a home called Bucklow Manor. But Kate hated it and discharged herself, thinking that Gerry, who was suffering from dementia, would soon follow.

'That is when the battle started. I asked for help to reunite them. Now they are living like they should, together and happy.'
