Aston Villa have been urged to appoint a manager with experience, by the man tasked with taking charge on a caretaker basis.

Scott Marshall, who took training at Bodymoor Heath on Friday morning and will lead the side against Leicester City in the FA Cup on Sunday, said the circumstances were too critical for a novice.

Marshall, first team coach, will step into the hot seat at Villa Park where his friend Paul Lambert once sat, assisted by goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall.

Caretaker boss Scott Marshall believes that the club must appoint someone with experience in his place

'This is a big club and it's not somewhere for someone to cut their teeth,’ Marshall said. 'It's certainly a big club and I would say there's not many things which are going to prepare you for this experience.

'I think a manager with experience is probably necessary but it's not really my decision or my call.' Marshall and Lambert have exchanged words since the latter was sacked following the 2-0 defeat to Hull that left Villa in the relegation zone. 'I've spoken to him and he's obviously disappointed,' he said.

‘He's been really good for me, he brought me in at Norwich and gave me and opportunity there and brought me here and gave me a great opportunity to work at a great club. So I'm hugely disappointed that's not going to continue.’
