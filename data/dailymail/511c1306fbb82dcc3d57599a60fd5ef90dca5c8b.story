The agonizing moment a police officer shot off his own finger after being handed in a loaded weapon in a gun store was caught on camera.

Darrell Smith, 58, who was with the Glasgow Police Department before the accident left him unable to return to work, is now suing the gun store after he lost his finger.

The clip, which was captured on surveillance footage, shows Smith browsing the counter of Barren Outdoors in Kentucky. 

The agonizing moment a police officer shot off his own finger after being handed in a loaded weapon in a gun store was caught on camera. Darrell Smith, 58, who was with the Glasgow Police Department before the accident left him unable to return to work, is now suing the gun store after he lost his finger

He is handed a .380 caliber gun by a store clerk and examines it before cocking it.

But suddenly he jumps back after shooting himself in the finger - an explosion can be seen.

Smith, in a daze, moves away from the counter, as the people in the shop look over in horror.

Smith's attorney B. Alan Simpson told Wave3 the gun was a trade-in and tagged for sale.

'This particular weapon caught his eye and he asked to see it,' he explained.  

Simpson said: 'He was just checking the action on the gun and unbeknownst to him, it was loaded.'

'His left index finger was pretty much shot off,' he said.

He said his client's finger is severely damaged. 

Surgeons operated on the other finger that was damaged, but the former officer now has a limited range of motion. 

On Friday, Smith filed a lawsuit against the store to cover his medical expenses and lost earnings - he could not go back to work following the accident after a 30-year career in law enforcement.

Smith is seeking a jury trial, lost income and punitive damages.

'While Mr. Smith was looking at the firearm, believing it to be unloaded, the gun discharged causing serious physical injury to [Smith],' the lawsuit says. 

It goes on to say that Smith exercised 'reasonable care and due diligence for his own physical well-being' while handling the loaded weapon, according to the Glasgow Daily Times.
