A drug patriarch who gave a thumbs up in his mugshot has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for operating an enormous indoor marijuana farm.

James Ford, 59, from Waldo County, Maine, was convicted of numerous offences by a jury last November - including manufacturing more than 100 marijuana plants and possessing a firearm.

His family also ran a similar growing operation in Weymouth, Massachusetts, but moved it north when it was discovered and Ford was convicted.

According to the Bangor Daily News his wife, Darlene, 58, is facing 40 years in prison but is yet to be sentenced.

Their elder of two sons James T. Ford was jailed for five years in June 2013. The 36-year-old was jailed for two years after his growing operation in Massachusetts was uncovered.

His younger brother Paul, 33, was given three years and ten months in a federal facility.

Members of the Ford family were arrested in November 2011 when the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency raided the family's garage and found hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of marijuana.

During the raid, police seized more than 300 marijuana plants, 10 pounds of processed marijuana and two semiautomatic assault weapons.

Ford's sentencing was initially delayed because of the passage of the Smarter Sentencing Act. The proposals would reduce sentences for those convicted of non-violent drug offences.

It is still passing through Congress. 

At the time of their arrest in 2011, Jim Pease of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency said: 'It was a very high-tech, very sophisticated, very neat grow. It was very clean, very organized, much like you would think of a computer lab.'

Prosecutors said that they grew the drug in Maine for around five years. According to ledgers investigators discovered in a desk - they raked in around $500,000 between 2009 and 2012.

The parents lived in an apartment above the garage - which had nothing else inside it aside from workbenches used to make guns and growing equipment.
