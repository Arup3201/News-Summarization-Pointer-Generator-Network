With temperatures dropping and daylight hours slipping away, the chances are you have already fantasised about basking on a beach in one of the world’s most exotic locations.

If so, then you are certainly not alone.

A new survey revealed that during October, Britons spent almost 20 hours a week thinking about and researching their next holiday – a trend dubbed ‘travel porn’.

Barbados is said to be the destinations that Britons most dream about visiting during the festive period

Price comparison website Icelolly.com studied the habits of 100 people, with each one asked to report daily on how many hours they had spent thinking about a holiday abroad over the past 24 hours.

They were also quizzed on how much time they had spent actually looking up destinations on the Internet.

According to the study, those looking for a morale-boosting and a way to escape the stress of the festive period spend an average of 1.7 hours a day considering their next trip.

They also spent an additional 1.1 hours surfing the web to check out holiday spots. 

Florida was the second most popular destination, with 18 percent saying they would like to visit the US state

Dubai was named as the third-most popular winter holiday location that people long to visit during the winter 

Mexico was in fourth place on the list, polling 15% of the vote

Icelolly.com also questioned a further 2,000 people over their holiday habits, with the survey also revealing that vacations were the second most popular topic of conversation between work colleagues at this time of year.

The most popular conversation piece was said to be people’s plans for Christmas and New Year's Eve, while financial worries came in third place.

The results are also said to be fuelled partly by coverage of exotic holidays taken by celebrities at this time of year.

Thailand got 11% of the vote, putting it in fifth place in the list of most popular places for a winter break

The results of the poll are said to be partly fuelled by coverage of exotic holidays taken by celebrities such as Rihanna and Simon Cowell at this time of year

US singer Rihanna and X Factor judge Simon Cowell are frequently pictured on holiday in Barbados around Christmas time and New Year.

The poll showed that Barbados was the destination Britons most longed to travel to, accounting for almost a quarter - or 23 percent – of those questioned.

The Caribbean island was followed by Florida on 18 percent, Dubai on 17 percent, Mexico on 15 percent and Thailand on 11 percent.

Suniel Makh, Brand Director at Icelolly.com, said: ‘Christmas is obviously a very exciting time and many of us are looking forward to spending some quality time with our family and friends.

‘However, with it also comes a fair amount of stress and it seems British people have found a new way to release the pressure, by sitting in front of their tech device for hours on end to gorge on pictures of sunny beaches.

‘Celebrities also play a big part in inspiring people by regularly inundating the social media sphere with pictures of their exotic trips, a feat Rihanna and Beyonce are often found guilty of.’
