They had chosen one of the most public arenas to air to the world the bitter row which had torn their marriage apart.

But now, after the best part of a week, multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith and his wife Kate Rothschild appear to regret using Twitter to launch a series of extraordinary personal attacks upon each other. 

Today, the pair called a truce on their marriage dispute by deleting the damaging snipes from the social networking site.

Outburst: Kate Rothschild took to twitter to attack her critics, telling them to 'get on with fixing' their own lives

The couple later put out a statement 
confirming their marriage was over and declaring their intentions to 
make no further public comment.

The
 Rothschild heiress first indicated her change of heart late last night 
and turned her attention away from her husband, instead using the site 
to lash out at her critics.

She
 posted a message which read: ‘All of you should go home
 and question whether you are really in a position to judge and condemn 
and then get on with fixing your own lives.’

Their relationship troubles had blown up 
into a full-scale Twitter war – with both sides launching 
attacks on each other on the social networking site.

But today they both deleted their public messages in what appears to be an attempt to calm mounting tensions.

The Goldsmiths also put out a joint statement through a PR company.

It said: ‘We are both deeply saddened that our marriage has ended after nine years.

‘It is a matter of regret to us that, at a time when our emotions and 
those of our friends have run high, things have been said in public 
which should have been kept private. We accept our full share of 
responsibility for this.

‘Contrary to what has been publicly stated, neither of us anticipates 
any major issues of contention to arise in the divorce, in which the 
interests of our children will come first.

‘There will be no further comment, either directly or indirectly, from us on any aspect of our family’s private life.’

Heading for divorce: Ben with Kate, who he has branded 'appalling' over her 
relationship with a rapper

Until last night, Mrs Goldsmith has only made comments on her marriage split through a spokesman.

But she then took to the social 
networking site to post a series of extraordinary tweets in response to 
those made by her husband on the same site.

She also appeared to draw their three 
young children into the ugly battle when she uploaded a photograph of 
them being returned to her by private jet with the caption ‘Plane 
relief’.

The posts came hours after 
Eton-educated financier Mr Goldsmith branded his wife ‘appalling’ over 
her relationship with Jay Electronica, 35, a US rapper she has been managing
 in her role as a music producer.

The musician, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, was in a five year relationship with Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter Erykah Badu, with whom he has a child.

But it is understood they are no longer together. He had recently posted a picture of Mrs Goldsmith accompanying him on a private helicopter to a Jay-Z and Kanye West concert.

Row: Kate Rothschild had tweeted that hip-hop star Jay Electronica, pictured, had 'saved her life' after her husband branded her 'appalling' for her relationship with the musician

In the 14 messages posted in quick 
succession she said the rapper had ‘saved my life’ and that she wanted 
to respond to ‘the vultures’ taunting her.

She wrote: ‘Ben in a rational mood 
would be the first to say that my devotion to my children is 
unshakeable. I am with them now, as I always am.’

She added: ‘Our marriage went bad a 
few years ago and none of you have any idea what I went through along 
with my husband.

'Then we separated for a while anger and bitterness 
following that time led to a very one sided story being deliberately 
released in order to shame and hurt me.’

The Rothschild heiress continued: 
‘This is the darkest time of my life.’

A later tweet said: ‘As for Jay 
Electronica…he saved my life in many ways and I am eternally grateful to
 him.’

Kate Rothschild posts cryptic tweet about being in a 'talespin' in first message since husband blasted her over relationship with rapper

In an earlier cryptic message, Mrs Goldsmith wrote on her account:

‘T.A.L.E.S.P.I.N.S.A.N.D.H.E.A.D.R.O.L.L.S.’

One interpretation of the message was that she believed Mr Goldsmith was ‘spinning’ the story about their marriage split.

Mrs Goldsmith has previously said the
 media has been fed ‘false and inaccurate information’ about the 
break-up ‘in a deliberate attempt to damage’ her.

The couple’s children have been on a 
pre-planned holiday in Italy with their father.

The picture of the 
youngsters climbing down the stairs of a private jet is believed to be 
of them being returned to her. It prompted a response from Electronica 
who said he ‘liked’ the photograph.

Last night it was unclear where any of the parties in the affair were.

Kate Rothschild took to Twitter to defend herself in the latest move in the battle between the estranged spouses

News of the marriage break-up emerged
 at the weekend, days after 31 year-old Mr Goldsmith was arrested at the
 couple’s £20million home in Kensington, West London on suspicion of 
actual bodily harm. He was released without charge after accepting a 
caution.

It reportedly followed a 
confrontation between Mr Goldsmith, youngest son of the late billionaire
 Sir James Goldsmith, and his 29 year-old wife over explicit texts and 
emails between her and Electronica.

He is now expected to issue divorce proceedings on the grounds of adultery.

The financier took to Twitter after 
the split to accuse his estranged wife of caring more about her image 
than their three children.

Mr Goldsmith, who inherited 
£300million after his father’s death, ridiculed music producer Kate for 
hiring a PR firm to ‘fix her reputation’, telling his 6,000 followers: 
‘A bit late surely? How about focusing on her devastated children.’

Backing from women: Mr Goldsmith has been deluged with messages of support on Twitter since it was revealed he had split from wife Kate

The couple married in 2003 but their 
relationship ran into difficulties earlier this year.

The marital home 
was put on sale last month and friends said rumours of a split had been 
circulating because of the time Mrs Goldsmith was spending with the 
rapper.

The impending divorce between the
 fabulously wealthy couple is unlike to see any huge financial 
settlements, according to a legal expert.

William Healing, partner in Kingsley Napley and an expert in high profile divorce cases, claimed
 the 29-year-old heiress would not be entitled to a share of her 
husband’s estimated £300 million fortune because he inherited it, rather
 than earned it, during their eight-year marriage.

He
 said Mrs Goldsmith’s own £18 million banking dynasty fortune she 
inherited from father Amschel Rothschild, who hanged himself in Paris in
 1996, would also be safe.

He said: 'Because most of the wealth was inherited in this case the 
courts are likely to approach the division of assets on a need basis 
rather than a full sharing basis.'

Mr Healing added: 'Couples will find all sorts of ways to hurt each other and social media, such as Twitter, is a new tool. 

Bitter feud: Mr Goldsmith hunting in the English countryside with rapper Jay Electronica, who has been exchanging messages with the financier's estranged wife

'They need to take a step back. At the end of the day social media can be there for years to come.

'They are grown ups, but do they really want their children to know they were the subject of what could be one of the most bitter new media divorces of the decade?'

During the row last week, when Mr 
Goldsmith claimed to have discovered incriminating messages on his 
wife’s phone, he was said to have slapped Kate and she called the 
police.

Jay Electronica is thought to have returned to London following his grandmother’s funeral in the US.

At his mother Marilyn Denise Flowers’
 bungalow in New Orleans, the family refused to discuss the rapper’s 
relationship with Kate, a member of the Rothschild dynasty who inherited
 £18million after the suicide of her banker father Amschel Rothschild.

One relative said: ‘He’s a grown man. He lives his own life.’
