As lava bursts almost 500 feet in the air from Iceland's volatile Holuhraun volcano, brave photographer Tomas Freyr Kristjansson gets as close as possible.

The fiery red fountain of the molten hot substance is no deterrent for Kristjansson who braves blistering temperatures to capture the natural phenomenon in all its glory.

During the 37-year-old's shoot, the volcano's activity became so intense that the Icelandic National Security Unit were forced to close the site to ensure the safety of tourists.

Kristjansson says the flowing lava makes a crackling sound like breaking glass that has to be heard to be believed

Tomas stops for a quick happy snap as the mountain of lava flows towards him 

'I got very close to the volcano as it erupted only a few days earlier,' he said. 'It was quite amazing to be this close as the sound from the lava is quite spectacular, it makes a clinking sound that is similar to that of breaking glass.

'The heat was incredible, I could have roasted hot dogs over some of the lava if I had wanted to. It was really hot and we could feel the earth trembling beneath our feet in the constant earthquakes.

'When we got close to the flowing lava the heat was so intense. It is like standing near a big campfire, you can feel your skin burning and becoming red.'

Tomas made a point of photographing nearby tourists to give some scale to the spraying lava, including a passing motorcyclist, but few went closer than him.

'The biggest crater, Baugur, was spewing lava up to 140 metres (460 feet) high in the air, I took photos of people nearby to show its height,' he continued. 

'There were times when we got a bit scared as the area was evacuated by the security because of volcanic activity under the Vatnajokull glacier.

'It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen, the forces of nature were massive. It was awesome, magnificent and beautiful all in one.'
