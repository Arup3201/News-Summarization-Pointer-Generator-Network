A brave passenger was applauded by fellow commuters after standing up to a preacher on the subway who was hurling a tirade of homophobic abuse.

A video shows the preacher shouting: 'If I weren't a preacher and I saw you I would get my shotgun. Michael Jackson died because he was gay.'

The man leaps from his seat and responds: 'I am a man. I am a good man and I'm a gay man. And Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me!'

Interrupting the preacher, the gay man says: 'You are full of hate. You are false. Do not listen to this man he is full of hatred, he is scared, he is ignorant.'

The gay man repeatedly shouts 'false prophet' over the preacher, and gains support from his fellow passengers, some of whom were filming the confrontation on their cell phones.

The preacher makes reference to 'little boys' and says: 'What the Hell are you teaching our children?' to which the gay man responds: 'That's not gay, that's a pedophile.'

The preacher added: 'You can't put two men together. Man not
 got no breasts, man got penis.

'It's an abomination. I tell Obama that 
gay is wrong, I tell Bloomberg that gay is wrong. Love is between woman and man.'

The two men shouted across the subway car in New York

The gay man called on other passengers to support him and shouted: 'Jesus is love. You are not of God, you are not of love.

'There's love on this train. Everyone for love let's clap. Love wins.'

Other passengers applaud him and can be heard whooping and shouting: 'Yes, love!'

The incident, which happened Saturday, is not the first time homophobic incidents on public transport have been filmed by passengers.

In 2009, a woman was filmed on a train in New York singing a reggae anti-gay song, which featured the lyrics: 'Me no like lesbian, leave me alone, stop following me around.'

Another video from Portland, Oregan, shows a woman telling men traveling back from a Pride parade in 2011: 'Do you know you won't go to Heaven?'

A man on a subway was filmed last year swearing at a gay couple and shouting: 'Men get married now, that's the Devil's way.'
