A billboard ad for shoe designer Brian Atwood has been banned from display by the building that houses the designer's soon-to-open New York store.

The campaign poster, which stars Candice Swanepoel, shows the Victoria's Secret supermodel  dressed in a black basque, hold-up stockings and leopard-print heels sitting astride two bare-chested men.

It was to be displayed outside the new boutique at 655 Madison Avenue in Manhattan's Midtown, according to the New York Post.

A film version of the ad, which was due to air on screens in New York taxis has also been banned by the companies that provide TV content for the Taxi and Limousine Commission.

A toned-down trailer for the film was also rejected for the in-taxi TVs, so a behind-the-scenes teaser will be aired instead. The film itself will play only on the designer's website.

As for the store exterior, the label has had a less racy image from the campaign approved for display.

The large-scale advertising campaign is a
first for Mr Atwood, whose shoes are popular with celebrities including
Victoria Beckham, Jessica Biel, Kate Hudson and Rachel Weisz.

Shot by top fashion photography duo Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, it makes its debut this month in the September issues of Vogue, W, V Magazine and CR Fashion Book.

The film, which is based on the theme, 'the sex is in the heel', was described by the designer in WWD as 'sexually charged'.

So too, it seems, is Mr Atwood's inspiration for his spring 2013 collection: the ankle.

'There is something so sexy about this part on a woman, and these shoes celebrate that,' he explained.

The new commercial presence for the 11-year-old Brian Atwood brand follows the sale of the label to The Jones Group earlier this summer.

The Madison Avenue store is set to be the first of many across the globe.
