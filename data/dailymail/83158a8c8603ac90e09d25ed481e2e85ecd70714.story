The harsh and remarkable challenge that is off-road endurance race the Dakar Rally is no more evident than in these incredible images from day five of the long-running endurance race.

Stage five of the 2015 race contested by motorbikes, cars, quad bikes and trucks ran through the space-like terrain between Copiapo and Antofagasta in northern Chile.

Originally the Paris to Dakar Rally, running as the name suggests from the French capital to Senegal's largest city, security concerns led to the 2008 race to be cancelled and it has since been run in South America.

Crystal-clear blue skies marked the fifth day of the race that has been running since 1979 and is among the most dangerous in the world

This year's race, the 35th edition of the  'rally raid', began with 665 competitors in 414 vehicles from 53 nations and covers a loop starting and finishing in Buenos Aires.

There were 164 motorcycles, 138 cars, 48 quad bikes and 64 trucks aiming to cover the 9,111km (5,661 miles) course that runs through Argentina, Bolivia and Chile over 13 stages in 14 days.

The fifth stage covered the arid Atacama Desert that in places could be mistaken for the moon, with crystal-clear skies and mesmerising landscapes.

Not only are competitors tested by a range of dangerous off-road terrain but temperatures that can be searingly hot and freezing cold.  

At the end of each stage, those involved in the race are given access to a vast array of local produce, which in this case includes octupus, sea urchins, honey from San Pedro de Atacama and Ayllu wine which is from grapes picked at more than 2,500m above sea level in Toconao.

Unfortunately, tragedy has struck again in the race that has now seen five people die since the race came to South America, and 28 incidents resulting in fatalities since its first one in 1979. Even more non-competitors have died in tragedies linked to the race. 

The sheer scale of the race means not all competitors are accounted for at all times and sadly Polish bike rider Michal Hernik didn't arrive at the finish of Tuesday's stage three in Chilecito. When a helicopter was sent in search of him he was found dead on the course without his helmet.

With no evidence of a crash, it was on Thursday revealed that his death was likely due to hypothermia and dehydration.
