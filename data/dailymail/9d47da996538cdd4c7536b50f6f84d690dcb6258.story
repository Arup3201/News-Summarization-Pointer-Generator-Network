Romanian police have issued a warning over reckless motorists using autopilot systems to let cars drive on their own following a new, worrying trend.

The warning came after a shocking video showing a 'driver' sitting in the backseat of his car while driving at 40mph as his terrified girlfriend screams from the passenger seat. 

The Mercedes S Class in the footage is fitted with dozens of sensors which read the road ahead to adjust the steering, speed and brakes.

A Mercedes driver sits in the back of his seat as his car continues at 40mph along a road in Romania, causing his girlfriend (right) to scream in terror

The autopilot system controls the brakes, steering and speed and only works when the driver has a hand on the wheel - but it can be easily fooled by a bottle of fizzy drink, it seems

The system only works while the driver's hand is on the wheel, but it appears the sensor is easily fooled when any other object, such as a bottle, is hung there instead.  

Speaking in Romanian, the man is heard telling his girlfriend not to worry, and boasting that the car can drive itself.

A fizzy drink bottle can be seen tied to the steering wheel as the car travels along the road at 40mph.

The woman can be heard yelling at her boyfriend to stop the car but he tells her it is ok, adding: 'The option works. Stop yelling, stop yelling. The car drives itself, trust me.'

The young woman replies :'No, don't leave it, are you nuts?' 

He then says: 'We won't die, it works. I trust my car'.

Romanian police issued a warning over the autopilot after a number of videos of drivers using the system dangerously appeared online

Police believe the incident was filmed on The Sun Highway, a stretch of motorway between Bucharest and the Black Sea city of Constanta.  

The people involved are yet to be identified and police are still investigating, but the footage is from just one of a number of similar videos in which people post about fooling the autopilot system.

Comments on the video were mixed, with one person saying: 'Real funny until somebody gets killed. Douchebag.'

However another viewer wrote: 'The car's electronic [system] does everything for you and you can relax by pushing the driver's seat backwards, into a comfortable couch position. The car brakes, speeds up, holds distance - all on it's own. Above 60 km/h (40mph) you have to take over the command again.'

The ‘Intelligent Drive’ package on the 2014 S-class sedan has integrated sensors, controls and 36 separate technologies.

While the technology is cutting edge, it isn't yet good enough to provide completely autonomous driving, despite attempts to hack the system. 

The system’s most notable feature, which has been in development for 15 years, is something called ‘traffic-jam’ assist.

This allows the car to steer, brake and accelerate itself at speeds lower than 37 mph (60 km/h).

A ‘Magic Body Control suspension system’ uses two cameras in the windshield to spot imperfections in the road, such as bumps, potholes. The suspension is then changed before the wheels hit bumpy surface.

‘Distronic Plus cruise control’, meanwhile, is a radar-based feature which maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front by braking when necessary and accelerating again when possible.

A feature called ‘Pre-Safe braking’ works up to 31 mph (50 km/h) whether or not the driver steps on the brake. According to Mercedes, it can 'partially mitigate' accidents up to 45 mph (72 km/h).

The features are made possible using 12 ultrasonic and six radar sensors, alongside eight cameras that monitor every angle around the car.

A control unit collects data from the sensors and the camera and then uses algorithms to provide commands to the car – all in just a 10th of a second.

The car also has technology to help prevent collisions by recognising pedestrians, as well as keeping in the lane and distance control with the car ahead. More common features include parking assistance and rear-crash monitoring.

There is also an updated attention-assist feature that checks to see when the driver is tired. It is linked to the car's navigation system, can even tell the driver where coffee and fuel can be found.

Radar position in the back of the car can detect whether a vehicle is approaching too fast. If this happens, rear signal lights are flashed to catch the attention of the approaching car.

If the driver doesn't react, the car automatically closes all its windows and adjusts seats upright.

However, the most controversial feature is a sensor to make sure the driver keeps his hands on the wheel.

It appears that the sensor is easily fooled when any other object such as a bottle of drink is hung there instead.
