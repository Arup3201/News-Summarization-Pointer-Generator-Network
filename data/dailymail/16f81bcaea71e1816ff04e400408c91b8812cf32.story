Prince Albert of Monaco and his wife Princess Charlene today accepted an offer of damages from the Sunday Times over a story which suggested she was reluctant to marry him.

Mark Thomson, representing the royal, said the article - published two days after the wedding - accused the prince of having the his bride's passport confiscated at Nice airport to prevent her from fleeing Monaco.

The July 2011 article alleged Charlene, 34, was reluctant to marry the 54-year-old prince after discovering the existence of a third love child.

It further claimed that she agreed to go through with the wedding for the sake of appearances in return for payment, with a view to obtaining and annulment after a seemly interval.

'None of these allegations are true,' Mr Thomson told Mr Justice Eady at the High Court today.

He said that the newspaper had admitted that they were untrue and accepted liability for making such defamatory claims in the article, entitled 'The full filthy Monte' and 'Curse of the Grimaldis'.

It had apologised and confirmed it would pay the couple damages, to be assessed at a later stage if not agreed, and reimburse their legal costs.

The newspaper article was published just days after Prince Albert and Princess Charlene were wed in a lavish ceremony at his palace in the principality that was headline news across the world.

Mr Thomson said it also falsely alleged Prince Albert had turned a blind eye to corrupt activity by his courtiers and done nothing effective to curb the activities of mobsters and money launderers in Monaco.

It also made the false claim that he had granted residency to foreigners on the request of advisers or friends for fear of their disclosing embarrassing secrets about his love life.

Mr Thomson said that the publication 'caused the newly-wed couple enormous upset and embarrassment' - particularly so in view of the huge publicity and worldwide interest given to their wedding.

Solicitor Rupert Earle, for Times Newspapers, offered its 'sincere apologies for the damage, as well as the distress caused to them' and said it 'regrets' that the allegations were printed.

Prince Albert, son of Hollwood icon Grace Kelly and Monaco's Prince Rainer III, is said to be one of the wealthiest royals in the world with a fortune estimated at £624million.

He married Charlene, then Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer from South Africa, in a July 2011 ceremony.

The couple were not at London’s High Court for the settlement of their libel action.
