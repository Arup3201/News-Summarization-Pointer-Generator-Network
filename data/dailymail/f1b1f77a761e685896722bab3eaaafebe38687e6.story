The fire which ripped through part of Eastbourne Pier is now being treated as suspicious, police have said.

New information today suggests the blaze on the 144-year-old structure on Wednesday ‘may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally’.

It comes after David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne visited the town to announce a £2million cash injection to help with the aftermath of the blaze.

Detective Inspector Mark O'Brien, of Sussex Police, said: ‘As a result of our investigation we have received information to suggest that the fire may have been started by someone, either deliberately or accidentally, and our investigation is now focusing on that line of enquiry.

‘A temporary scaffold platform has been erected adjacent to where the fire is thought to have broken out in order to enable scenes of crime officers and fire investigators safe access to the area.’

Police have called on people to submit pictures or video footage taken at the entrance or on the pier in the hours before it started.

Superintendent Laurence Taylor said: ‘The area around and under the pier is still very hazardous and there is a security team deployed to stop people putting themselves in danger.’

The Prime Minister visited the town today with George Osborne as he pledged to support the town.

The pair met with members of the East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and the crew from the Inshore Lifeboat Station.

Mr Cameron said: ‘The Government is absolutely committed to supporting coastal towns, and through our long-term economic plan we are creating jobs and boosting tourism.

‘I know that the loss of one of Eastbourne’s most prominent and well-loved landmarks will have hit the town hard and I am determined to do all I can to help local businesses recover.’

The fire happened at the height of Eastbourne’s important summer tourist season.

In the next fortnight, the resort hosts its biggest summer tourist event - the annual Airbourne Air Show - which draws tens of thousands of visitors.

Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne also announced an extra £3 million for the Government’s Coastal Communities Fund to encourage growth and create jobs in coastal towns.

Mr Osborne said: ‘Eastbourne Pier is a much-loved local attraction and this fire is devastating news. I am therefore delighted to be able to provide financial support so we can minimise the effect on business and tourism.

The town is now set to receive a £2 million boost after a fire destroyed its Grade II listed pier this week

‘We will work with Eastbourne as a matter of urgency to ensure that the funding is provided without delay so people can start enjoying the pier again.’

Coastal Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt named 10 coastal towns which will receive £8.5 million from the fund in the latest round of applications.

The money will be used to boost tourism, regenerate historic sites and provide new flood defences, Downing Street said.

But there is hopes that the fire-hit pier could reopen again as early as next year, as two-thirds of it was untouched by flames, according to Eastbourne MP Stephen Lloyd.

The Liberal Democrat MP has said that following talks with East Sussex’s chief fire officer, the structure appeared ‘pretty sound’ and called on the community to rally round the pier’s stricken traders after fears that some had no insurance.

Mr Lloyd said: ‘There is real damage but I’m confident that it can be repaired.

‘It’s still very much standing, and I’m very hopeful and confident that it will be reopening next year and be back in business.’

Helen Brook and Stuart Pearce, who were due to get married on the pier in three weeks’ time, have seen their dream dashed.

The couple were to have wed on a section of the Victorian structure which escaped the flames.

Ms Brook told ITV Meridian: ‘Once we heard that people were safe and had been evacuated, it then hit home what it meant for us.

‘Since yesterday, it has been a very emotional couple of days. We are just shell-shocked really.’

East Sussex has been cursed by the devastation of some of its beloved piers in recent times.

In 2003 the 148-year-old West Pier in Brighton was reduced to a mangled mass of metal by two major blazes within two months.

In Hastings, the Grade II listed pier was almost destroyed in a fire in 2010 following years of neglect by its then-Panama-registered owner.

Efforts are now well under way to restore Hastings Pier after more than £13 million was secured mainly though the Heritage Lottery Fund.
