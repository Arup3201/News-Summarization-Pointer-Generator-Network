Serial hoaxer: Partially-sighted Jacqueline Hustler, 48, made several bomb threats in hoax phone calls to shops, charities and hospitals

A judge today branded a serial hoax caller a 'menace' to society after she made terrifying calls to hospitals, charities and shops threatening them with bombs.

Partially-sighted Jacqueline Hustler, 48, was already on bail for making bomb threats to five different Marks & Spencer stores and five hospitals when she threatened the Samaritans, a social worker and even her own mother.

Bradford Crown Court was told Hustler only made the phone calls because of 'uneven flag stones' in her 'unsuitable' property and loneliness.

But Judge John Potter refused to accept her vulnerability as an excuse, telling Hustler: 'I have absolutely no hesitation at all in naming you as a menace to your community.

'Your actions, in my judgement, are deliberate and designed to cause significant harm and distress throughout the community.'

Hustler was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after she admitted nine counts of communicating false information with intent.

The court heard how she had already faced court action in 2011 after admitting making more than 200 hoax calls to emergency services in West Yorkshire.

But prosecutor Jo Shepherd today told the court how Hustler, who is estranged from her children and lives alone in Bradford, West Yorkshire, began making a fresh barrage of calls on October 29 last year, ringing M&S stores in Bridlington, Castle Donington, Kendal, Bradford and Derby.

Hustler whispered down the phone when staff at each store answered that there was a bomb outside the main door of the shop, in the form of a brown paper box.

Calling the Castle Donington store, she told them her name was Marcus and that the bomb would go off in half an hour. Panicked staff evacuated the store and police were called, but no bomb was found.

At Kendal, Hustler told them her name was Marcus Cartwright, before bizarrely telling the staff member she had a young girl with her who was unconscious.

Threats: Bradford Royal Infirmary was among the hospitals that Hustler called claiming there was a bomb in the vicinity

'It’s my daughter Linda. I’ve given her ecstasy tablets but she thought they were sweets. The ambulance needs to hurry up, she’s not breathing,' Miss Shepherd described Hustler telling the staff member.

The court also heard that she contacted several hospitals and charities, including two to Eccleshill Community Centre, two to Bradford Royal Infirmary, one to Dewsbury District Hospital, one to a MacMillan Hospital in Bradford and one to Westmorland Hospital in Kendal, Cumbria.

She sent a mixture of text messages to the hospitals and also made phone calls herself - again threatening that there was a bomb in the vicinity.

Police traced the mobile phone number back to Hustler, who denied making the calls.

But while on bail for these offences, she committed further hoax calls on December 7 last year.

The court heard Hustler only made the calls because of 'uneven flag stones' in her 'unsuitable' property and because she was lonely

She again called the Bradford Royal Infirmary and Eccleshill Community Hospital, as well as voluntary charities including the Samaritans in Bradford, the Morley Street Centre and even a social worker who had worked with Hustler in the past.

Text messages read by an automated voice told terrified staff at the Eccleshill Community Hospital, which offers rehabilitation for patients over 65 who have come from hospital, that there was a bomb in reception.

Hustler rang the hospital to whisper bomb threats down the phone approximately three times. She also sent three text messages to her previous support worker telling her there was a bomb in her office.

As well as ringing hospitals, she also made a four silent phone calls to 999 on December 7, Miss Shepherd told the court.

She even sent her own mother, Margaret Foster, five text messages which read ‘pervert’.

Again, Hustler was arrested where she denied sending the messages or making calls but pleaded guilty when she appeared at Bradford Magistrates in December.

Jailed: A judge at Bradford Crown Court described Hustler as a 'menace' to society and jailed her for three-and-a-half-years for nine counts of communicating false information with intent

Hustler, wearing dark glasses and carrying a black stick, was helped into the dock by her barrister Sophie Drake.

She said the reason Hustler had made the calls was because the property she is living in is unsuitable because of 'uneven flag stones', loneliness and because of 'anger towards her mother'.

Ms Drake added: 'She doesn’t appear to understand why she behaves in this way... She says she hates what she does.'

But Judge Potter said this did not excuse Hustler's actions, telling her: 'I make it very clear that your vulnerability in the community and your physical disabilities provide absolutely no excuse for the way in which you deliberately behaved in the course of the commission of these offences.'

Calling the phone calls a 'campaign of bomb hoaxes', the judge added: 'Suffice to say that one can readily imagine, given the terms of each phone call made, significant alarm, distress and therefore harm being caused.'

Judge Potter told Hustler: 'Your targeting of institutions such as hospitals are a significant aggravating factor in this case.

'Members of the public simply going about their lawful business were evacuated from a number of places, no doubt causing them at the very least inconvenience and almost certainly significant alarm and distress.'
