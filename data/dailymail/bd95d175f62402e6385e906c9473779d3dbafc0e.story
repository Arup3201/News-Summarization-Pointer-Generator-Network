Pastor and father-of-two Alan Martin set the bar high when he was bestowed with a 'Never-Ending-Pasta-Pass' six weeks ago: He planned to eat at the restaurant each day, twice a day.

It's a challenge that might have defeated even the most voracious eaters but Mr Martin, from North Carolina, is on track - eating 95 meals at Olive Garden over the past six weeks.

And with the pass costing just $100, the Olive Garden fan has already made his money back 15 times over - but insisted he has not gained any weight.

Now nothing will put him off his plan to continue eating Olive Garden twice a day until the deal runs out on November 9. 

Mr Martin considers himself something of a celebrity at his local Olive Garden in Burlington, where he chows down a bowl of pasta for lunch and dinner - with extra cheese - each day.

He greets those steaming pasta entrees with the words: 'Hello friend.'

But the pastor dreams big, telling Fox 8: 'I would love to be the person that ate the most of the 1,000 people. That would be a good contest to win. Because that means I got the most value out of the card of anyone in the United States.'

When he bought the pass back in September, he told the news station that he didn't mind if he put on weight because of the money he would have saved. 

Mr Martin said that he hadn't had enough of pasta yet but by the end of the seven weeks, he would probably want a burger or pizza.  

Only 1,000 of the passes were made available and covered a 150 combinations of pasta and sauce at the Italian food chain

It was a carb-loading dream when Olive Garden announced the 'never-ending pasta pass' in September - which sold out in 45 minutes.

The $100 golden ticket has allowed Olive Garden fans to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. 

Fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9.

Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 combinations of pasta and sauce available at Olive Garden.

The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol.

The pass can be used as many times as the user wants throughout the seven-week period at Olive Garden locations across the U.S.

The attention-grabbing promo has come at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster.

The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster.

Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession.

Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July.

There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls.

Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January.
