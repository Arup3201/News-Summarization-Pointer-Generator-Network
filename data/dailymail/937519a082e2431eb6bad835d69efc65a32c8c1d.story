Two pilots have been suspended and an airline has been threatened with being grounded after its cabin crew were videoed dancing in the aisles on board a flight during the Holi celebrations.

SpiceJet has landed itself in hot water with the Directorate General Of Civil Aviation (DGCA) after clips of the two-and-a-half-minute routine at 35,000ft were posted on YouTube.

In the three-minute video, crew on board a Goa-Bangalore flight can be seen dancing to Bollywood hit Balam Pichkari in the air while pilots take photos on their mobile phones. The moves, to celebrate the Hindu festival Holi, were reportedly professionally choreographed.

Passengers can also be seen in the two-and-a-half-minute video clapping along to the music.

However, the DGCA yesterday issued a show-cause notice to SpiceJet, saying the dancing on board the SG-876 flight endangered aircraft safety and created an 'unruly environment', and asked why its licence should not be suspended.

The DGCA notice states: 'Cabin crew acts had drawn the attention of other crew on duty, thus reducing their preparedness/alertness. 

'The frequent movement of the dancing 
crew may have affected the aircraft's centre of gravity during flight 
and created turbulence.'

'Passengers dancing in the aisle creates an unruly environment,' a DGCA official added.

A spokesman for SpiceJet said it had put on extra staff for these flights, adding: 'The cockpit was manned at all time as per DGCA regulations that govern the situation when one pilot is outside for example to use the lavatory.

'The dance was professionally choreographed and was Holi delight for passengers much like it is done by several airlines around the world to celebrate a special occasion. The entire dance sequence lasted 2.5 minutes.'

The airline has 15 days to
 reply to the notice: 'Failing which it will be assumed they have 
nothing to say in their defence and suitable action will be taken 
against them.'
