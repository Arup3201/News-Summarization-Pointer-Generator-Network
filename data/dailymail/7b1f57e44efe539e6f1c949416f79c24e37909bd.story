Britons are said to be flocking to the US for their summer holidays to capitalise on the soaring rate of the pound against the dollar.

The value of sterling has risen to 1.68 dollars for every pound - the best rate which British visitors to the US have seen since 2008. 

The expected rise in bookings to the US comes as it was revealed that St Ives - one of the most popular seaside resorts in the UK - is the most expensive coastal resort to visit on holiday in August, with the average cost of one room per night priced at £123.

make the most of the soaring rate of the pound against the dollar. Pictured here is Disney World in Orlando, Florida, which is expected to see the biggest influx of British tourists

With the current exchange rate, £500 will buy around $845, which is around $85 more than last year and $130 more than 2009.

Foreign exchange firms have now said they expect a surge in bookings to the US, with Florida expected to be the most popular destination.

This is said to be helped by the low prices at Disney World, the famous family resort in Orlando, compared with other European destinations. 

A spokesman for World First, based in London, told MailOnline: 'Looking at how the exchange rates have moved in the last year, it’s clear to see that your pounds will now go further.

'At today’s GBPUSD exchange rate of 1.6896, £500 gets you $845. Six months ago, the same amount would have got you $815, and a year ago it would have been even less - $760.

'That’s a big difference in the space of a year, and with the exchange rates in Brits’ favour, more and more of us may be tempted to take advantage of a strong pound.'

Alistair Rennie, a spokesman for First Rate Exchange Services, also told The Daily Express that the strong exchange rate spelled good news for those wanting to head across the Atlantic, especially to Florida or New York.

He said: 'Sterling's recent surge in value could prove
 the catalyst that galvanises more people to plan trips abroad.

 St Ives in Cornwall has been named the most expensive seaside town in 
the UK for this August, as Britons flock to the resort to make the most 
of the balmy weather

'In
 the coming weeks family trips to ­Florida are likely to be most popular
 and holidays to see New England in autumn are also likely to see a 
benefit.

'As the year progresses, shopping trips to New York are likely to get a boost as the pound will make shops in the Big Apple even cheaper than before.'

In its latest research, Post Office Travel Money found prices in the popular US resort are much lower than those in other common destinations such as Spain and France.

Throughout 2013, prices for tourist items such as meals and drinks had plunged over 20 per cent year-on-year in the world’s theme park capital, the research found.

A three-course family meal for four 
people is now said to be priced at around £48, while clothes and beauty 
products are said to cost up 50 per cent less than in London.

Hiring a car was also cheaper in Florida than in 19 European destinations, according to predicted prices in August.

The strong exchange rate will come as
 a blow to some UK resorts, in the competitive market to  recruit 
holidaymakers for a 'staycation'.

As
 Britons consider making the most of the recent sunny weather and 
spending their holidays nearer to home, the top 20 most expensive 
seaside retreats have been revealed.

In the survey, compiled by cheaprooms.co.uk, a break in St
 Ives was nearly double the cost of a 
stay in Aberystwyth, Wales.

In second place was Tenby
 in Wales, where an average room is £107, and Cowes on the Isle of Wight, where rooms are £94 on average.

The list was compiled using the cheapest price of a double room 
in accommodation near a beach rating three stars or higher in August.

Dartmouth in Devon, which is £87 per night, and Barmouth in Wales - £86 - were fourth and fifth in the last.

Falmouth
 and Padstow, two more resorts in Cornwall were named in the top 10. 
They share the sixth spot with Scotland's Oban at an average rate of £84
 a night.

Swansea - £83 - and Swanage in Dorset, with an average price of £81, make up the final top 10.
