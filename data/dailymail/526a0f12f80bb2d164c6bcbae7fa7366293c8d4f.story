A major privacy row has broken out over technology that can 'listen in' to phone calls and work out what mood the participants are in.

Telefónica, owner of the O2 network in Britain, says it is developing the technology so customers can 'learn about themselves'.

However, experts have warned it could be used to sell advertising more effectively - and say it is a 'huge risk' to consumers.

This week Telefónica boasted the technology is '80% accurate' as it revealed the system in a secret meeting at the Mobile World Congress exhibition in Barcelona.

A team of engineers and psychologists in Telefónica's Barcelona research facility has built a working version, although so far they have only tested it on internal volunteers.

The firm claims it can only analyse a tone of voice, and not work out what is being said.

'This is a 
proof of concept that our innovation lab has been working on to empower 
people with their own data to see what it says about them,' a spokesman said.

'There are no 
plans to commercialise this and absolutely no intention of offering this
information to advertisers.'

However, experts say the technology is likely to be seen as extremely lucrative to advertisers - and warned it could be a huge risk to consumer's privacy.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It might sound futuristic but voice analysis, like facial recognition technology, poses a huge risk to people’s privacy because it’s easy to use without people knowing.

'If it is ever turned on, this must be an opt-in system, with people fully aware of who will be able to see these psychological profiles and what purpose they are being drawn up for.

'We’re seeing an arms race between all kinds of companies to gather as much data on their customers – indeed anyone they can – as fast as possible and ultimately the real motivation is likely to be corporate profits, not consumer benefit.

Mobile giant Telefonica, which owns O2 in the UK, has been working with psychologists to develop the controversial software

'The question is whether consumers are willing to tolerate this kind of intrusive monitoring for slightly better targeted advertisements or spurious service changes.

'I expect most people will be strongly against the privacy of their calls being intruded upon in this way.'

Eden Zoller, a consumer analyst at Ovum, said the privacy concerns may make it impossible for the system to ever be launched.

‘Consumers are increasingly concerned 
about how their personal data is exploited, which in turn is reflected 
by mounting regulatory scrutiny of this issue,' she said.

‘Ovum believes that a commercial launch for the project is likely to be challenging.

'Telefonica’s linguistic analysis engine provides a deep level of granularity, even without listening to actual conversations, and we think that consumers will be very uncomfortable and resistant to the idea.' 

She believes the system could be used in a similar way to Facebook's controversial Graph Search, which 'mines' a user's profile for information.

'While Google has the search graph and Facebook has the social graph, Telefonica Digital says that it has the voice graph,' she said.

'This level of insight would clearly be of interest to advertisers and organizations in sectors such as tourism.'
