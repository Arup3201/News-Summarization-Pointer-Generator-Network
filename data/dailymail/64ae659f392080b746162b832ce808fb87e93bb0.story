A community-minded couple, who won an eye-watering $136.5million with a Powerball ticket, have broken with the fast car, fancy house tradition of lottery spending by investing in a sewage treatment plant.

Mark, 52, and Cindy Hill, 51, have decided to use their new-found wealth to improve Mark's hometown of Camden Point, Missouri, which is home to fewer than 500 residents. They live in nearby Dearborn.

City officials were estimating it would take around 25 years to complete the treatment works so the couple stepped in donating $50,000. It will allow families in the town to do away with individual septic tanks.

Speaking to CNN, Cindy Hill, 51 said:
'For some reason (God) put it in our hands. I think to make sure it 
goes to the right things.'

And the sewage works isn't the only local project receiving a windfall as a result of the Hills good fortune.

The couple are also paying for a new 
fire station so the emergency service can have direct access to the 
local highways and a new ball field which will allow kids to play away 
from traffic.

Camden Point fire chief, Walt Stubbs, said the donation would doubtlessly save lives.

'Money changes a lot of people,' he told the broadcaster. 'They are just good people and are willing to help others.'

'They are doing some really nice things for the community.'

Shock: Cindy Hill recounted her disbelief at realizing she had the correct numbers at the lottery press conference in November. She has since said she wants to spend her money on the 'right things'

Plans: The Hills said they may adopt again after the success of adopting Jaiden from China. They say they want to stay grounded as a family

The couple have also donated a scholarship fund to North Platte High School in Dearborn, which they both graduated.

Mayor Kevin Boydston said: 'I've said all along 
that these lottery winnings could not have gone to a better couple. They are giving back to the community, just like they 
said they would.'

The projects are not surprising considering the down-to-earth family's reaction to their win.

Rather than moving to an exclusive 
resort or investing in a fleet of Maseratis the family have stayed in 
their modest family home with husband Mark meeting his friends for 
coffee in the local convenience store, as normal, every day.

The only big purchase they've made since netting the staggering amount was on a simple pick-up truck.

Excitement: The family said they were excited and wanted to stay grounded

'I'm real proud of them,' said Shirley Hill, Mark Hill's mother. 'They have stayed grounded. That's their nature.'

In the winners press conference Cindy said: 'I just want to go home and be back to normal. Maybe take a nap.'

Back then Mark said he was 
already struggling to adjust to their new life.

When the Lottery put them up
in a hotel, he ran to get toothpaste - and caught himself checking 
prices.

'Old habits are hard to break,' he said, laughing.

The couple have an adopted six-year-old daughter Jaiden and three adult sons.Â 

They've previously said they will consider adopting again because of their win.

Sharing the news: A Missouri reporter tweeted this picture of what appears to be Hill's Facebook announcement in November

Mark, a mechanic at a hot dog and deli packaging factory,
had given his wife $10 to buy tickets. She bought five after picking 
her daughter up from school, chose numbers at random and left the 
tickets in the car overnight.

The next morning, she checked the 
numbers and on discovering they had a winning ticket, she called her 
husband and said: 'I think I'm having a heart attack!'

She
drove to her mother's home to verify the numbers and was later met by 
her husband, who had refused to believe her.

Their son Jason, 26, initially said of the win: 'I hope we stay grounded and I hope we stay the good 
people we were yesterday.'
