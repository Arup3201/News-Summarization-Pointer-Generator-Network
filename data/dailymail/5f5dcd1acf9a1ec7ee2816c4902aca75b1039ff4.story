During the three-day Laura Charmichael (who plays Lady Edith), Raquel Cassidy (Lady's Maid, Mrs Baxter) and Kevin Doyle (Footman Joseph Molesley) are all set to grace the hotel with their presence.

The weekend, the second of its kind at the hotel, will also feature a treasure hunt, a question-and-answer session with Jessica Fellowes, author of A Year in the Life of Downton Abbey and a costume party.
