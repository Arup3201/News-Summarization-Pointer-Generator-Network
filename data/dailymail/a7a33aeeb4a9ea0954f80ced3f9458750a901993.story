Garry Monk has warned ‘lazy’ Jonjo Shelvey that he faces the axe from the Swansea team unless he ‘wises up’. 

Monk’s patience with the 22-year-old is close to snapping as Shelvey prepares to face his former club Liverpool on Monday.

It will throw into sharp relief how much Shelvey has, or has not, developed since leaving Anfield in 2013.

Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has been booked six times already this season

He has already warned Shelvey about his habit of picking up cheap bookings and the latest flashpoint came on Friday, when the midfielder picked up his sixth yellow card of the season for needlessly hauling down Gabriel Agbonlahor in the first half of the win over Aston Villa.

Shelvey was then pulled off early in the second half and his place in tonight’s fixture at Liverpool is also in jeopardy.

Monk said: ‘I have spoken to him clearly about it. Silly bookings, we can’t afford it.

‘I have spoken to Jonjo and he has to wise up. The yellow card came from being lazy and he has to be better than that.

‘There are only so many times you can say it — he has to learn very quickly and make sure he works instead of being lazy and risking a red or coming off.’

Shelvey has been in distinctly patchy form since his England call, with four of his next 10 games coming from the bench.

Monk is known to have concerns about Shelvey’s maturity, but while his age has been used in mitigation in the past, Monk is no longer granting him any leeway.

He said: ‘It is about doing your job properly and understanding the role you are playing, not just for yourself, but for the team. I have spoken to him about this and he has to learn, otherwise he won’t play games.

‘I don’t want to be in that position where he gets a yellow and I’m thinking the rest of the game that there could be a sending-off. I shouldn’t have to worry, so it isn’t my problem, it is Jonjo’s. I see him every day and his ability is frightening. I have said I am more than willing to give him the chance to show it, but you also need to want it yourself. I think he does want it, but he also needs to understand the time for being lazy with it is gone. He has to push himself. He’s not a kid any more.’

Liverpool look set to recall goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after Brad Jones injured his thigh against Burnley on Boxing Day.

Mignolet has had a rotten season and came in for heavy criticism before he was dropped. But he has since held a frank conversation about his form with Brendan Rodgers.

He said: ‘We spoke together, cleared up a few things and that was a positive discussion. I will keep my head down and work hard and try to do my best.

‘I will not discuss what we said, but it was an honest meeting. That is always a positive. The negative thing was being out of the team but you try to make it a positive and that is what I am trying to do. Sometimes you can reflect on certain things when you are out of the team because during the busy periods you maybe don’t get a chance to.

‘That is what I have done with the goalkeeper coach and the gaffer and you learn a lot. We can move on and hopefully build on that. I don’t have to prove anything.’
