Aidy Boothroyd masterminded his England U20 side to victory over Germany as they got their three-game tour of Holland off to a winning start.

The game was settled in the first half by an own goal by Germany’s Niklas Sule in the 34th minute.

England, with up-and-coming stars such as Arsenal duo Isaac Hayden and Chuba Akpom and Southampton pair Matt Targett and Harrison Reed, are involved in the four-team tournament along with Turkey and Holland in a competition designed to replicate the experience they will likely face later in their careers.

And Boothroyd was pleased with the start his Young Lions, who also featured two players from League Two Exeter City, made to the tournament.

He told The FA.com: ‘We’re delighted to start off with a victory against a very strong German team.

'When we looked at their squad we could see they had a lot of players born in 1994, so many were a year older than ours.

'They had a number of players that had won the U19 European Championship too – so to start off with a win against that side is very pleasing.

'It was a tight game. We’ve hit the post, they’ve hit the post and we’ve both a number of good chance too.

'But in the end it was down to an own-goal caused by some really good attacking play which sealed it.’

Boothroyd’s side face hosts Holland in Heerenveen on Saturday and he is expecting another tough test.

He added: ‘We all know the pedigree of players the Dutch produce and the good attacking football they always like to play,' he said.

'We’re here to compete and we need to get some refuelling done. A couple of days’ rest and then we go again.'
