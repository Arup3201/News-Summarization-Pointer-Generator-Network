An Orlando police sergeant is claiming gender, age and disability discrimination after she says she was fired because breast implants she'd received while recovering from breast cancer prevented her from wearing a bulletproof vest.

Master Sergeant Rhonda Huckelberry, a 25-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, has filed a lawsuit against the department after it fired her for failing to wear the vest, despite Huckelberry's being allowed to work without a vest on doctor's orders for the last 17 years.

Following her dismissal, Huckelberry was brought back for light duty.

Until three years ago, Huckelberry was a supervisor on the department's tactical crime unit, according to WFTV in Orlando. However, after a controversial officer-involved shooting, she was kicked out of the unit following a bad review from a supervisor.

In 2010, the tactical crime unit - which normally investigates violent crimes - was ordered by Huckelberry to arrest a man in a Target parking lot.

According to a federal lawsuit first obtained by WFTV, Huckelberry suspected one of the men of stealing her husband's credit card, which is why she ordered the TCU to arrest him.

During the bust, however, suspect Rogelio Cortes tried to flee in a truck and was shot four times by officers. Authorities later claimed that he tried to ram them with the truck, but video surveillance footage of the incident showed that Cortes' truck was rammed by an Orlando Police Department patrol car, which pushed him towards the officers, which prompted them to open fire.

After the shooting, Cortes was charged with theft and attempted murder of an officer - charges that were later dropped.

Huckelberry was cleared of all wrongdoing in the shooting, and Orlando Police Chief Paul Rooney said the officers had a right to shoot because it appeared the suspect was trying to flee.

Since Huckelberry's poor review following the shooting, she claims that every assignment she's requested has been given to a younger, male officer.

Huckelberry blames Rooney's poor leadership for the alleged discrimination.
