Englishmen Richard Bland and David Howell were one stroke behind early pacesetter Kevin Phelan on the first day of the Africa Open in East London.

Bland, 42, and Howell, 39, both shot four-under-par rounds of 68 to trail Phelan after the Irish golfer mixed six birdies with a bogey to sign for 67.

Bland could have returned to the clubhouse as a joint leader had he not dropped two shots across three holes on the turn.

A  bogey on the par-four 12th scuppered Howell's chances of taking a share of first place.

Twenty-year-old Matthew Fitzpatrick was in the hunt on three under after picking up three strokes on the front nine before remedying the effect of a bogey on the eighth with a birdie on the 531-yard 15th.

Welwyn Garden City's Tom Lewis and Gregory Havret of France also signed for 69 while South African hopeful Doug McGuigan fired four birdies over his first seven holes before slipping away to card 71.

Howell, who came second in last week's Joburg Open, is currently tied second on day one with Bland

Among the players making good progress up the leaderboard from the later group was Spaniard Eduardo De La Riva, who opened with an eagle on the par-five first hole before finding birdies on the third and fifth.

The title will definitely change hands this year given 2014 champion Thomas Aiken is instead competing at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral.
