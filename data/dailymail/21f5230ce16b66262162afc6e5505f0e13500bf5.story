Rafael da Silva's time at Manchester United appears to be at an end with the club willing to listen to offers for the right-back.

The Brazilian, 24, is a cult hero at Old Trafford but has not impressed manager Louis van Gaal.

He has made just nine appearances this term and despite overcoming injury was left out of the squad for the last two matches against Sunderland and Newcastle.

Rafael's tendency to take risks coupled with a fiery temperament have made him a firm fans' favourite.

But it is those traits which are thought to have sealed his fate under the methodical Dutch manager.

The writing for Rafael has been on the wall throughout the season.

Van Gaal has been willing to play others out of position at right back and has been quick to praise youngster Paddy McNair, who recently signed a new contract.

United also retain a keen interest in Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne, while reports in Spain claim they are locked in a two-way battle with Real Madrid for Porto's Brazilian right back Danilo.

Rafael, last seen in the 2-0 FA Cup win at Yeovil on January 4, will have 12 months remaining on his contract at the end of the summer.

A number of clubs in his homeland are interested, with Cruzeiro thought to be leading the charge.
