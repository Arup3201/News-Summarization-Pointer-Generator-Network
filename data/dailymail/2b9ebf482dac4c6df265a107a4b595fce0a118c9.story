An extraordinary dossier of secret recordings gathered by police to help convict two parents over the deaths of their six children in a tragic house fire was publicly released today.

In one recording, father-of-17 Mick Philpott, who was today found guilty of manslaughter along with his wife, tells her: ‘It’s my fault that half the family’s gone. I should have seen it all coming, duck.’

And in another recording, he tells Mairead in a police van: ‘My brief said that for the judge to do what he’s doing, he’s got to have some big balls because there’s no evidence - they’ve got nothing.

‘There’s no petrol on me, on my trousers, no glass. You know the fireman said he put the window through? I said he f*****g didn’t - I did. We’ve got nothing to worry - just stick by what we’ve said.’

The Philpotts were convicted by jurors at Nottingham Crown Court of the unlawful killing of the six children on May 11, 2012. A third defendant, Paul Mosley, was also found guilty of manslaughter.

During the trial, the court heard that the six children - Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13 - all died as a result of the petrol-fuelled blaze.

In one secret recording from May 15 last year, the couple are alone in a room and preparing for bed.

Philpott tells his wife: ‘You notice 
they’re saying accident ? Not saying it’s a murder enquiry eh?’ She 
replies: ‘Fatal accident, they just said.’

'My brief said that for the judge to do what he’s doing he’s got to have some big balls because there’s no evidence - they’ve got nothing'

Mick Philpott to wife Mairead

He says: ‘We’ll have to ask thingy tomorrow what that actually means. Saying it’s arson, then next thing saying it’s accident.’

In other recording, the couple discuss the behaviour of his former mistress Lisa Willis. The trial heard the blaze was part of a ‘plan’ he had to frame her after she left the home three months earlier.

Philpott says: ‘I said to them, it looks like she set me up when there were two and that’s nice. Mairead, what she said was she’d get her a house. I never thought she’d turn like that you know.’

His wife replies: ‘Mmm’. He continues: 
‘Do you think it’s because we love her?’ She replies: ‘Yeah’. Later in 
the conversation, Mairead Philpott says: ‘No, I really don’t want to believe
 that she’s done it.’

'It’s my fault that half the family’s gone. I should have seen it all coming, duck'

Mick Philpott to wife Mairead

The couple then say they both feel sorry for her. Philpott adds: ‘She’s brought our kids up and we can’t even turn round to her and say: “Do you want to come to the funeral”?’

A recording from May 17 of a sex act in which all three defendants appeared to be in the same room was played to the jury, and afterwards Philpott is heard to say to his wife: ‘I’m proud of you.’

‘Hmm?’ she replies. He says: ‘I’m proud of you because you didn’t want to do it, I’m proud of you because you lied to me.’ She asks: ‘When?’ He replies:  ‘Well, you said you wanted to do it and you didn’t.’

Police response: Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill (centre) of Derbyshire Police issues a statement outside Nottingham Crown Court following the verdict

The children were asleep in their beds 
upstairs when the fire, which was set inside the semi-detached house by 
the front door, took hold in the early hours.

As the jury delivered its verdicts in respect of Philpott, he stood in the dock staring straight ahead with his hands clasped in front of him.

As the court heard guilty verdicts in respect of his wife, he shook his head and she looked down at the floor and fought back tears while clutching a tissue in both her hands.

Mosley showed no emotion as he heard the guilty verdicts. People in the public gallery erupted in tears and shouts as the verdicts came in. Members of the public hugged one another as they cried.
