Freed Australian journalist Peter Greste will not be giving up his job as a foreign correspondent, despite a warning from his mother Lois that 'we are not going through this again'.

Mr Greste was speaking at his first open media conference in Brisbane on Thursday after being freed from an Egyptian jail and deported from the country earlier this week.

'I don't want to give this up, my job up. I'm a correspondent, it's what I do,' he said.

'How I do it, whether I actually do go ahead with it I don't know.'

His mother Lois said she had always believed her children should follow their passion. 'At the same time ... he has got to know that we are not going to go through this again.'

Peter Greste told the media throng that it was 'incredible to here, I have dreamt about this so many times'.

'We are not going to go through this again' warned Peter Greste's mother Lois, as he vowed to return to work as a journalist despite his 400-day ordeal

Mr Greste spent much of his time in jail meditating, starting a masters degree in international relations with Queensland's Griffith University - doing his essays with pencil and paper - and working out with his cell mates

'I'm probably in better physical condition that I have been for the past 20 years or so,' he admitted.

He described their ordeal as being similar to a 'near death experience' and vowed to do all he could to secure aid the release of his colleagues.

'We're going to all that we can to support that,' Mr Greste said.

'These guys are like brothers ... there's a lot that we share.'

Mr Greste said he and his colleagues weren't abused while in jail.

'We were treated with respect and dignity as much as can be expected under the circumstances,' he added.

The tears of joy flowed freely in Brisbane. Australian journalist Peter Greste and his parents are pictured at the news conference on Thursday. Mr Greste returned to Australia in the early hours of this morning after spending 400 days in a Cairo prison after he was arrested in December 2013 and charged with defaming Egypt and having links with the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood

The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed at Brisbane Airport at 12.45am and, with a huge grin, stepped off the plane into the arms of his ecstatic family.

He told the media throng that it was 'incredible to here, I have dreamt about this so many times'.

Mr Greste paid tribute to his family's unwavering support and said their dignified campaign was the main reason behind his release.

'We were never really sure when it was going to end or how it was going to end.'

However, his release was bitter-sweet. Mr Greste continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed.

The three men were sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2013, after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi.

Mr Greste insisted he would continue in his chosen profession: 'Far more doors opening up that I have had the chance to look through. I am a correspondent, it's what I do.'

He said his colleagues were 'like brothers' and 'I trust they will follow in due course and when they (get out) we will party very hard'. 

'Are you guys waiting for someone important?' Greste joked as he address media. 'I cant tell you how ecstatic I am to be here, this is a moment I've rehearsed over and over. Well, I've rehearsed it about 400 times over the last 400 days'

Greste was quick to acknowledge his former inmates who remain behind bars, including fellow Al Jazeera staff: 'I will say this a million times, this is tempered with worry for my colleagues and all the other guys imprisoned beside me'

He urged Australians to not forget the plight of those fighting for freedom in Egypt. 'This has generated a lot of goodwill in Australia. Egypt has a chance to show justice doesn't depend on nationality'

An excited contingent of about 100 loved ones and supporters were waiting for Greste at the airport terminal, filled with relief after a long campaign to bring the reporter home.

'Are you guys waiting for someone important?' Greste joked as he addressed media. 

'I can't tell you how ecstatic I am to be here, this is a moment I've rehearsed over and over. Well, I've rehearsed it about 400 times over the last 400 days.'

Although, Greste was quick to acknowledge his former inmates who remain behind bars, including fellow Al Jazeera staff.

'I will say this a million times, this is tempered with worry for my colleagues and all the other guys imprisoned beside me.' 

'If it's right for me to be free, it's right for all of us to be free.

He was released from prison and deported on Sunday after a presidential 'approval'. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year

'Special thanks to all who've supported us over the past year. MUST NOT FORGET THOSE STILL IN PRISON @Bahrooz #FreeAJStaff @MFFahmy11… Keep shouting #FreeAJStaff' he wrote.

Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, a message on his account read: 'This is Mike who has been running Peter's twitter account since his arrest. A truly massive thank you to everyone who joined the campaign.

It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home and looking forward to seeing his family again

However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the Tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed
