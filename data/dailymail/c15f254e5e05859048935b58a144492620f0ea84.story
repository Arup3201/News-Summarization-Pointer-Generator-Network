She may not be able to drive for another 15 years, but 14-month-old Sorella Stoute has already picked the car she wants.

The Portland toddler managed to successfully bid for a 1962 Austin Healey Sprite on eBay after playing with her father's smartphone last month.

The first her father knew of her secret shopping spree was when he received an email from eBay congratulating him on the winning $225 bid.

'She decided to open the eBay app, and 
started clicking around and one thing led to another and we own a car,' 
Paul Stoute told KOIN News.

At first, the Oregon couple were not sure whether they could afford to take on the car, which needs a lot of work.

However, they have decided to keep it and Mr Stoute plans to do it up in time for Sorella's high school graduation or 16th birthday.

'I’ve done a lot of body work in the past, like bondo and stuff like that,' he said. 'But this is another realm altogether.'

His wife, Christiana, told Fox 12: 'It comes with two engines. They're both in the back seat.'

Sprites that have been restored can sell for nearly $14,000.

After deciding to keep the car, the couple contacted Sorella's grandmother, Carlene Stenejhem, to see if they could store it at her house.

At
 first, Ms Stenejhem did not believe Mrs Stoute when she called to say 
Sorella had bid on a car that they now needed to pay for.

Since the toddler's shopping spree, her parents have added security codes and other locks on their phones.

'I’m just glad she didn’t buy the $38,000 Porsche I was looking at,' Mr Stoute said.
