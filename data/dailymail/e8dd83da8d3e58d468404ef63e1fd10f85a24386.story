A woman and her husband have admitted burying her parents in the back garden of their home nearly 16 years ago.

Susan Edwards, 55, and husband Christopher, 57, denied murdering William and Patricia Wycherley at an earlier court hearing.

But during a plea hearing at Nottingham Crown Court, the couple each pleaded guilty to two charges of obstructing the coroner in the execution of his duty and the theft of a credit balance.

The Wycherleys disappeared from their semi-detached house in Mansfield in 1998.

Police launched a murder investigation after two sets of human remains were found in the garden of their home in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, last October.

Post-mortem examinations showed both had been shot.

Nottinghamshire Police said DNA testing had formally identified the remains –discovered after a tip off – as those of Mr and Mrs Wycherley, who would now be 101 and 79 respectively.

The accused, of no fixed address, were arrested at St Pancras International station in London on October 30 last year as they returned from France.

At an earlier hearing at Nottingham Crown Court the couple each pleaded not guilty to two charges of murder between May 1 and 5, 1998.
