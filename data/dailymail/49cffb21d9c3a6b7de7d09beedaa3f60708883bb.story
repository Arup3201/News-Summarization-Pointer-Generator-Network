Repair work has begun on a massive sinkhole that grabbed worldwide attention after appearing on a scenic golf course in Inverness-shire.

Bosses of the course are relieved work is under way after drainage issues caused a 23ft long and 10ft wide crater on the seventh green at Traigh Golf Course in Arisaig last November.

Fears had escalated that the stunning 68-par, nine-hole course could become a bog, and bosses faced a funding crisis to repair the damage.

It was estimated that the repairs could cost in the region of £16,000 and 200 tonnes of sand would be needed to fill the pit. At one point the 80-member club faced an uncertain future.

The Traigh Golf Course committee has now confirmed contractors have started work on the massive sinkhole and hopes are high that the course will be playable for the start of the golf season on April 1.

A spokesman said: 'Corries of Fort William have started works which are scheduled to take about two weeks. It looks a bit messy just now, but all should be well for the start of the season on 1 April.

'The course remains open for members to play, weather permitting, and when the new season starts visitors will again be welcomed back.

A digger and a tractor were used to help fix the damage and a new drainage pipe has now been installed

'Some of the costs will be covered by insurance and the owners, who remain passionate about the course, have confirmed that they will be making up the shortfall. All being well, we might even have a new feature to make the seventh more interesting.'

A digger and a tractor were used to help fix the damage and a new drainage pipe has now been installed in the 11ft deep hole.

Course admin manager Bill Henderson, 70 said: 'The hole is now just about history because the work started earlier this week and we are renewing the whole drainage pipe from the course down to the sea.

'That should be finished soon and then we can get the work completed and get the course open.

Fears had escalated that the stunning 68 par course could become a bog and bosses  faced a funding crisis

'The money to repair it has mostly come from private money and a little bit of insurance.

'I couldn't believe the publicity we got when the sinkhole appeared on the course, it seemed it was everywhere around the world.

'But I just hope that now more people have heard about the course they will want to come and play it.

'It is a lovely course with great views over the isles round about us and it will be ready for play come the start of the season.'

Sinkholes are depressions in the ground caused by a collapse in the surface layer and can be devastaing

Traigh Golf Course is also notable for being the most westerly golf course on the UK mainland. 

Heavy rain and poor drainage saw the hole suddenly appear in November.

Golf fans posted on Twitter and Facebook in support of the club that is more than100 years old.

TV shows in the US featured the hole on their golf coverage and it made news reports in China, Germany, Holland and Canada.

The word Traigh (pronounced 'try') means 'beach' in Gaelic. Sandy beaches run alongside the beautiful course, with sweeping views to the Hebridean islands of Eigg and Rum, and the Cuillins of Skye. 

In March 2013, an 18-ft deep sinkhole on a course in the US swallowed a golfer who was walking down the middle of a fairway.

He was later pulled out of the hole after a 20-minute rescue mission.
