The winner of the famous Nathan's hotdog eating contest proved he had an appetite for love as well as snacks when he proposed to his girlfriend before today's competition.

Joey Chestnut, who has now won the Coney Island, New York, contest eight times, got down on one knee and asked Neslie Ricasa to marry him, just moments before the men's division started.

After proposing in front of two giant hotdog mascots, Chestnut went on to be crowned champion again by devouring 61 hotdogs in 10 minutes.

Ricasa looked surprised but happy by the unusual proposal, saying she was glad that Chestnut had asked her to marry him before the contest rather than afterwards.

And, with a wedding to pay for, the estimated $10,000- $20,000 prize money will be a welcome addition for Chestnut, who is the leading competitive food eater in the world.

Chestnut managed to win the contest but failed to beat his own world record, which was 69 hotdogs in 10 minutes. 

The 28-year-old, who lives in San Jose, California, makes an estimated $200,000 a year from eating contests, where he has gained worldwide fame for his ability to scoff everything from chicken wings and Twinkies, to boiled eggs.

Chestnut, who weigh 230 pounds, told AM New York that his girlfriend has always supported him at food-eating contest.

He said Ricasa stands in the front row, yelling: 'Don't get lazy! You're getting lazy!'

'She enjoys yelling at me,' he said.

Ricasa was also taking part in the famous July 4 contest, although she failed to get placed in her division.

While Chestnut kept his title for the eighth consecutive year, the defending women's champion Sonya 'Black Widow' Thomas was defeated by Miki Sudo.

Sudo, of Las Vegas, gobbled up 34 franks and buns but Thomas, of Virginia, was able to manage only 27 and three quarters.

Chestnut's former nemesis in the contest, Takeru Kobayashi, was absent again this year. He was banned from taking part in 2010 after refusing to sign an exclusive contract with Major League Eating.

This year, the Japanese native nicknamed the Tsunami will compete against five other competitive eaters at a separate event on Fifth Avenue in a quest to down the most hot dogs without buns in 10 minutes.

While the crowds who braved the blustery weather in Coney Island to cheer on the food-eaters enjoyed the spectacle, some of those taking part confessed they were pleased it was over.

Tim Eater X Janus, who came third in the men's division, told DNA New York he had been preparing all year for the contest, but after swallowing 44 hotdogs, was pleased to be done.

'As the hours pass, you start to resent the dogs,' he said, adding that while he felt OK for now, he knew he would start to feel full later in the day.
