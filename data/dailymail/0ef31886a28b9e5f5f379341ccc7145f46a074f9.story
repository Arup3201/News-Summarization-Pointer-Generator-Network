As he walked through the tunnel en route to the first tee Justin Rose gave a fist bump to the mural that showed Seve Ballesteros striking a similar pose.

After hitting a miraculous shot out of the bushes on the 13th to within two feet of the flag the 34-year-old Englishman turned to the accompanying camera and remarked ‘A bit of Seve for ya!’

These evocations of the great Spaniard might have been out of character for a normally undemonstrative man but Rose’s performances over the past three days seemed to be infused by the spirit of Ballesteros, a man so famously enthused by the Ryder Cup.

By the end of it all last year’s US Open champion had contributed almost 25 per cent of Europe’s points to become, in the phraseology of their opponents, the MVP: most valuable player of the event.

On the final day others made more eyecatching contributions than the hard-earned half he managed against Hunter Mahan, who he finally clawed back having gone four down after the sixth. 

That he outmatched the American’s seven birdies with eight of his own told of the quality of the match.

Later he acknowledged the debt owed to Ballesteros but also cited as an inspiration the more unlikely figure of Sweden’s Peter Hanson, who played on the team in Medinah.

Rose said he was inspired by Peter Hanson who fought hard on the final day of the singles in 2012

‘On the front nine I was basically trying to be Peter Hanson,’ said Rose. ‘He was six down to Jason Dufner on the Sunday two years ago but ended up taking him all the way up the 18th.

‘That sent an important message to the rest of the team that day, that we were still in there fighting, and I wanted to send the same message.’

The mild-mannered Rose does not have the flamboyance of Ballesteros or the in-your-face quality of Ian Poulter but this team format sees him transformed into fist-pumper in chief, and he is quietly assembling a Ryder Cup record to stand with any of them.

Today it reads nine wins, two halves and three losses after his four points that will go down as one of the finest European performances in the competition over the past 30 years.

The Englishman produced one of the finest displays by a European, complete with uncharacteristic emotions

Had he not been paired with Martin Kaymer on Saturday afternoon, or Mahan not been so impressive yesterday, then his tally might have been of more historic proportions.

His high-water mark came on Saturday morning when, in completing three wins out of three with Henrik Stenson, he was sinking putts with the ease of a man placing litter in the bin.

He could have been excused feeling weary yesterday, especially going so far behind, but instead responded with a run of five straight birdies.

And then there was the amazing save at the 13th, which was where Ballesteros especially came in. 

‘When I walked up to my ball it was in the gorse bush and I thought, “I’m dead here”, and all I could do was try to punch out an eight-iron. 

'Seve was at his best when he was trying to make something out nothing, I’ve been watching footage of him doing that my whole life so that’s why I thought of him.

Rose channeled the spirit of Seve when playing from difficult positions as he led Europe to glory

‘It just felt so Ryder Cup, and how he used to battle away and never give up. He is still fresh in our memory and has a big impact on us. Here his was the last image you would see before walking onto the first tee, and we had a big picture of him in our team room as well.’

What eternally fascinates about a competition that wraps up an essentially individual pursuit into a team format is that it can make some grow beyond their stature and diminish others.

While Rose’s collegiate temperament makes him a natural fit, there were fears beforehand that the more introverted Victor Dubuisson might struggle with all that it entails. 

Yet Dubuisson emerged with two-and-a-half points from three, and looked like he and Graeme McDowell had been playing together since childhood.

Others, such as Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson, showed that veering from their norm of merely looking after their own games is not conducive to producing their best.

Stephen Gallacher found the experience overwhelming on the front nine of his first outing, although he fared better yesterday and was unlucky to be drawn against a determined Phil Mickelson.

Bubba Watson looks glum after the world No 2 lost all three of his matches at Gleneagles 

Rickie Fowler has still never won a match at the Ryder Cup after losing heavily to Rory McIlroy

Fowler has now played for eight points in the Ryder Cup and failed to win any of them, becoming only the fifth man in the last 10 editions not to register a full point from five matches, although he did manage three halves.

Watson is a more striking example, and in going 0-3 at Gleneagles has now lost eight of his 11 matches, despite having won two of the last three Masters. ‘I guess I’m too nice,’ he said. That was once the label attached to the charming Rose, although it is now well and truly defunct.
