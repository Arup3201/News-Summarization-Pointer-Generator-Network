Parents are hiring disabled people to pose as family members so they can skip the huge lines at Disney World.

The allegations come from a Manhattan mom who claims she hired a tour guide using a motorized scooter and managed to skip the queues.

The 'black-market Disney guide charges $130 an hour, or $1,040 for an eight-hour day' reported the New York Post.

Claims: A Manhattan mother is claiming that she hired a disabled tour guide to skips Disney queues from Dream Tours Florida. The company is run by Ryan Clement and his girlfriend Jacie Christiano, pictured with a Disney actor - the mother indicated Christiano was her family's guide

'My daughter waited one minute to get on ‘It’s a Small World’ - the 
other kids had to wait 2 1/2 hours,' one mother told the newspaper.

The mother told the news outlet that she hired the guide through a tour company called  Dream Tours.

‘You can’t go to Disney without a tour concierge. This is how the one percent does Disney.’

They were escorted through the park by a woman in a motorized scooter with the word ‘handicapped’ on the back.

Instead of joining the queue for the general public, they were sent to a different entrance every time with no queue.

The scam is able to work because Disney rules allow each disabled customer to bring up to six guests.

Convenient: Disney allows each guest who needs a wheelchair or motorized scooter to bring up to six guests to a 'more convenient entrance'

Dream Tours Florida is run by Ryan Clement and his girlfriend Jacie Christiano - the New York mother indicated Christiano was her family’s guide.

Mr Clement denied that Christiano is only hired to help families skip queues.

He admitted that she uses a scooter on the 
job, but said she has an auto-immune disorder.

A source told the newspaper that the number of the disabled tour guide service has been passed around rich parents in Manhattan. 

On its website, Dream Tours Florida states it 'specializes in making “Dreams Come True” for adults with Developmental disabilities & children with various special needs, such as; Aspergers Syndrome, Autism, Down Syndrome, physical impairments, as well as other diagnoses.'

It states that Christiano is an executive director who gained a 'Masters degree in Psychology.... prior to her own disabling experiences..'

The Mail Online could not reach Jacie Christiano or Ryan Clement for comment.
