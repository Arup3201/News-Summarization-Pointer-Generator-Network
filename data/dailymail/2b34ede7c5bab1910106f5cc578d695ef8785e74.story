Title challenge: Eric Cantona said he wanted a shot at the French Presidency

It briefly looked like the man revered by Manchester United fans as King Eric might also be aiming for the title of President.

But reports that Eric Cantona was planning to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy for France’s highest office were yesterday revealed to be a stunt to highlight the work of a homeless charity.

The former footballer, 45, now an actor, announced on Monday that he had written to mayors seeking their backing to run for the French presidency in May.

He would have needed to secure the backing of 500 elected officials by the end of February.

In
his letter he pledged to stand up for 'the millions of families who 
have been forgotten' and condemned the lack of opportunities for young 
people.

But visitors to his website yesterday were redirected to a charity’s petition to improve housing for the poorest people in France.

His website - ericantona.fr - was 
re-routed directly to a charity's petition to improve housing for the 
poorest people in France.

Homeless campaigners the Abbé Pierre Foundation said the device had already brought them an extra 100,000 signatures for their cause.

As well as becoming an Old Trafford legend, Cantona also achieved notoriety when he launched a ‘kung fu’ kick on a Crystal Palace fan during a match in 1995. Later, he told reporters, enigmatically: ‘When the seagulls follow the trawler, it’s because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much.’

Spokesman Patrick Doutreligne said: 'We needed a high profile figure like Eric Cantona to bring attention to our campaign.

'The
sudden show of public support shows that housing an homelessness in a 
nationwide problem that merits more attention in the presidential 
campaign.'

France goes to the polls in May to elect its next president and French newspapers said today that the 45-year-old would have 'stood no chance at all' of ever winning a nomination without the backing of a political party.

The footballer turned actor was exposed to nationwide ridicule the last time he attempted to support a cause in 2010 by calling on French citizens to bring down the banks by withdrawing all their money.

It later emerged that he had recently been paid £30,000 by a bank for a series of television adverts.

In his now fake letter to mayors, he had said: 'This engagement obliged me to speak, more earnestly than usual, but also with a keen sense of my responsibility, at a time when our country faces difficult choices which will be decisive for its future.'

The letter, printed in the Liberation newspaper, showed his strong feelings towards the social injustices experienced by the French nation, and by young people in general.

Election candidates will compete in a first round in late April, with the two biggest vote-winners going through to a decisive second round in early May.

Retired: Since he stopped playing, Cantona had a spell as captain of the French national beach football team and was named Director of Soccer at the New York Cosmos

Socialist candidate Francois Hollande is currently leading President Nicolas Sarkozy in the polls.

Since retiring from football, Cantona had a spell as captain of the French national beach football team, starred in the film Looking for Eric and was named Director of Soccer at the New York Cosmos.

Had Cantona actually become President of France, it
would have marked a radical turn around for the man who lashed out at a Crystal
Palace fan with a kung-fu kick in 1995.

His
short fuse saw him angle the assault on Matthew Simmons after receiving
a red card for a blatant kick at opposition defender Richard Shaw.

As
he headed for the tunnel, a volley of abuse from Simmons in the stands 
elicited a response from the United No 7 that no one could have 
predicted.

Surging towards the Palace fan, Cantona cleared the advertising hoardings and thrust a karate-style right foot square into his chest, then regained his balance enough to chuck a few right-handers in the direction of the 'victim' as thousands watched on, looking aghast.

Simmons, a 20-year-old self-employed glazier at the time, was sentenced to seven days in jail for threatening and abusive behaviour and had his season ticket rescinded by Palace for 'breaking ground rules.'

Cantona was stripped of his captaincy of the France national team, initially sentenced to jail, changed to community service on appeal, and banned from football for nine months.

It was after his court hearing that Cantona gave his famous speech about seagulls and trawlers.
