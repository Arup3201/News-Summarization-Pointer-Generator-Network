The Food and Drug Administration has approved changes to the
label of popular sleep drug zolpidem that, in some cases, even include a
warning not to drive a car the entire day after taking the drug.

On Tuesday, the regulator approved the changes for two
brand-name producers of the drug: Sanofi, which makes Ambien and Ambien CR and
Meda AB, which produces Edluar.

The agency said patients who take zolpidem extended-release
drugs, such as Ambien CR, should not drive or take part in activities that
require complete mental alertness the entire next day.

Lights out: The FDA has OK'd changes made to labels of brands of the sleep drug zolpidem at its own behest

The regulator said that women were more susceptible to the
risk because they eliminate the drug from the blood more slowly than men.

Approved changes also include a lowered dose recommendation.

The agency said that research had shown that the drugs
remain in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with morning
driving, which increases the risk of car accidents.

The FDA in January asked zolpidem manufacturers to reduce
recommended dosages on the drugs’ labels. They also said doctors should aim to
prescribe the lowest dose possible that will successfully treat insomnia.

Strong: Zolpidem, the active ingredient in popular sleep aid Ambien, has been found to last far longer than first believed, which will now be reflected on labels

Today, the changes implemented by those manufacturers were
approved.

The FDA recommended doses of 5 mg for women and either 5 mg
or 10 mg for men for immediate-release zolpidem products such as Sanofi's
Ambien.

The initial dose of extended-release products is 6.25 mg for
women and either 6.25 or 12.5 mg for men, according to the FDA.

The popularity of zolpidem has led to some highly visible
incidents caused by its use on recent years.

Danger: The FDA says the extended release form of zolpidem can make driving dangerous for a full day after its use

Last July, Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert Kennedy and
ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was reportedly under the influence of
the drug when she smashed into a tractor trailer rig then fled the scene in
Westchester County, New York.

Kennedy later claimed she inadvertently swallowed one of the
slim, white pills instead of a different, similar looking pill the morning before
the crash.

Difference: Women were found to be especially susceptible to Ambien 'hangover' and labels have been changed to reflect that

Kennedy’s cousin, former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy,
crashed his Ford Mustang into a barrier near Washington, DC’s Capitol Hill in
2006 and would later attribute his disorientation that led to the accident to
Ambien.

But the new FDA-approved guidelines prove disorientation
isn’t just a problem for the elite.

The regulator also said women are more susceptible to the
risk of disorientation the day after use of zolpidem, as they eliminate the
drug from the blood more slowly than men.
