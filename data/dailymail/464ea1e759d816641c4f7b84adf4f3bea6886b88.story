Fed up, the unidentified driver got of the car, leaving the engine on, then opened the passenger door and demanded Emini leave.

But Emini snuck around the driver's side door, got behind the wheel, then sped off northbound on Orleans Street, The Chicago Tribune reports.

Cops caught up with him at about 2:15 p.m. on West Superior Street.
