Disposable contact lenses have been developed which mimic the surface of the eye – making them the most comfortable yet, according to wearers.

They have been created specially for middle-aged people who have trouble reading but have been put off wearing contacts because they irritate the eyes by drying them out.

The lenses are made of a new material called HyperGel which has the same water content as the cornea and double that of standard silicone contacts.

Comfy: A new kind of contact lenses which mimic the surface of the eye and said to be the most comfortable yet are to be marketed specially for middle-aged people who have trouble reading 

The Biotrue lenses are also breathable, allowing for 93 per cent transmission of oxygen, just short of the 100 per cent available to the open eye.

It all means they not do dry out the eyes as much and become uncomfortable for wearers.

The contacts were engineered for people with presbyopia – age-related loss of focus, which affects more than half of adults over 40. The condition occurs when the crystalline lens of the eye ages and loses flexibility.

As a result, those with the condition might have to hold newspapers or restaurant menus further away to read them easily.

But older people are less likely to wear contacts to correct their vision because their eyes tend to be drier.

London-based contact lens optician Wendy Sethi said the Biotrue lenses, which are available on the high street, help avoid dehydration of the eye, with less than 2 per cent of water lost during a day’s wear.

‘It makes them extremely comfortable to wear and the whole process less daunting,’ she said. 

‘I had a man in his 50s – a first-time contact lens wearer – in my practice today who said he could not feel them at all.’

Francesca Marchetti, an optometrist and adviser to WINK, an independent eye-care panel supported by Bausch + Lomb, makers of the new lenses, said the one-a-day, disposable contacts have added hygiene advantages.

Reusable, soft contacts must be cleaned and disinfected after every use to prevent a build-up of bacteria and proteins.

The new contacts cost between £40 and £60 a month, depending on individual practitioners’ prices.
