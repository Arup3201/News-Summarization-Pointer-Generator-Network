Ed Miliband faces humiliation in Scotland after a poll revealed Labour could be left with just three Scottish MPs after next year’s general election.

The Scottish National Party is now on course to secure more than 50 seats in May, meaning Alex Salmond could hold the balance of power at Westminster.

Such a dramatic collapse in Labour’s support in Scotland could easily offset any gains made in England and Wales and destroy Mr Miliband’s hopes of getting into Downing Street. 

Ed Miliband faces humiliation in Scotland after a poll revealed Labour could be left with just three Scottish MPs after the General Election

The prediction of a Scottish wipeout comes as it was revealed Mr Miliband was barred from speaking at a key event in the referendum campaign because he was seen as a liability north of the border.

The Guardian/ICM poll of Westminster voting intentions put the SNP on 43 per cent in Scotland - nearly double its 2010 general election performance.

Labour fell by 16 percentage points to 26 per cent, with the Conservatives on 13 per cent, Ukip on seven per cent and the Lib Dems on six per cent.

Based on the overall poll figures, Labour would get ten of the 59 Scottish seats, compared to 45 for the SNP, three for the Liberal Democrats and one for the Conservatives.

But when trends for each region are taken into account, it reveals there has been a bigger 22 per cent swing towards the SNP in ‘safe’ Labour seats.

It indicates Labour will lose all but three of the 41 seats they won in 2010, with the Nationalists securing a commanding 53 seats, compared to just six now.

Among the constituencies that would fall to the SNP under this forecast is the new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy’s East Renfrewshire seat, which he has held since 1997.

Leading polling expert Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University said: ‘There is no reason to believe that the swing to the SNP does not extend to what are supposedly the safest Labour seats in Scotland.

‘If anything, the swing appears to be even greater in such seats.

Mr Miliband was reportedly asked by former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont (right): ‘Why are you here? You are not winning any votes’

‘If we take into account the difference in the movement in different types of seats then the estimate becomes SNP 53, Labour three, and Liberal Democrat three - while the Conservatives emerge empty handed.

‘In short, pretty much every Labour seat in Scotland has to be regarded as currently at risk of being lost to the SNP.’

Yesterday it was claimed that Mr Miliband was stopped from speaking at a rally on the eve of the Scottish referendum. 

Mr Miliband was reportedly asked by former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont ‘Why are you here? You are not winning any votes.’

Another Labour source described Mr Miliband as a ‘total liability’ who had a ‘hugely negative’ impact on the campaign and ‘didn’t win us one vote’. 

It was also claimed relations between Mr Miliband and his election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander have plummeted to a new low and they are barely on speaking terms.

Mr Miliband allies have accused Mr Alexander of ‘sulking’ since Manchester Labour MP Lucy Powell was put in charge of day-to-day election campaigning.

But Mr Alexander’s friends have hit back, claiming he is ‘frustrated’ by Mr Miliband’s ‘inability to act decisively’.

Alex Salmond stepped down as First Minister following the Scottish referendum, but will stand for the SNP in the Gordon constituency at next May’s election leading to the possibility of a comeback at Westminster.
