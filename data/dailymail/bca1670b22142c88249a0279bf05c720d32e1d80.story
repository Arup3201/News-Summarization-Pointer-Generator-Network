The first fraud victims who had their credit cards details stolen and used by hackers who infiltrated Target's computer systems today emerged to condemn the store.

The store has admitted that data from about 40 million credit and debit cards might have been stolen from shoppers at its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season, in the second-largest card breach at a U.S. retailer.

The data theft, unprecedented in its scale, took place over a 19-day period that began the day before Thanksgiving. Target said that it identified and resolved the issue on December 15.

It is thought hackers obtained the data by remotely installing software on 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores nationwide.

The software could have spread through the Target network after being installed on a company machine, possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a 'phishing' scam.

Christopher Browning, 23 of 
Chesterfield, Va., said was the victim of credit card fraud earlier this
 week and he believes it was tied to a purchase he made at Target with 
his Visa card on Black Friday. However, he called Visa Thursday and the 
card issuer couldn't confirm. He says he hasn't been able to get through
 Target's call center.

Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking in to Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines.

The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip -including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine.

All the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks.

On
 Monday, Browning received a call from his bank's anti-fraud unit saying
 that there were two attempts to use his credit card in California - one
 at a casino in Tracey, Calif. for $8,000 and the other at a casino in 
Pacheco, for $3,000. Both occurred on Sunday and both were denied. He 
canceled his credit card and plans to use cash. Although Browning has no
 proof, he says he believes the fraud was tied to his Black Friday 
purchase at Target.

"I 
won't shop at Target again until the people behind this theft are caught
 or the reasons for the breach are identified and fixed," said Browning.

Though smaller than the breach 
disclosed in March 2007 by TJX Companies Inc, parent of apparel chains 
TJ Maxx and Marshalls, the data theft took place over a much shorter 
period and hit shoppers at the beginning of the U.S. holiday season.

Target said the breach might have compromised accounts between November 27 and December 15, a period of nearly three weeks.

The
 data theft revealed by TJX took place over 18 months, affecting 45.7 
million payment cards, according to the company. Banks later said in 
court documents that the hackers could have obtained more than 94 
million account numbers in the TJX case.

On
 Thursday, Target told customers in an alert on its website that the 
criminals had stolen customer names, payment card numbers, expiration 
dates and their CVV security codes.

The company's shares fell in today as the
 Secret Service launched an investigation and the first victims of the 
theft began to emerge.

This data would allow them to produce counterfeit credit cards, and if they were also able to intercept PIN numbers they would be able to create debit cards to withdraw money from ATMs.

"On
 December 15, we were able to identify an unauthorized access and we 
were able at that time to resolve the issue," Target spokeswoman Molly 
Snyder said by telephone.

Almost all stores: Nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores were targeted as hackers infiltrated 40,000 credit card machines

Krebs
 on Security, a closely watched security industry blog that broke the 
news on Wednesday, said the breach involved nearly all of Target's 1,797
 stores in the United States and investigators believed the data was 
obtained via software installed on point-of-sales terminals used to 
swipe magnetic strips on payment cards.

It
 is not yet clear how the attackers were able to compromise 
point-of-sales terminals at so many Target stores. "It is very clear it 
is a sophisticated crime," Snyder said.

If you think yours was one of the 40 million credit or debit cards involved in a data breach at Target, security experts recommend a policy of watching and waiting: Watch the account you used at the retailer on a daily basis, and wait, because there's no telling when it will be tapped by thieves.

With the information that was obtained in the data breach between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 - cardholder names, card numbers and the three-digit security codes - crooks can use them for online transactions or manufacture duplicate cards.

"This could be something that hits your card months from now, so you need to continue to be vigilant," says Yaron Samid, chief executive officer of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity.

Don't look for crazy, big-ticket charges, Samid says.

Sophisticated hackers are more likely to make small purchases, sometimes aimed at checking the viability of an account.

"These folks are not going to put a $10,000 charge on one card," Samid says. "They're going to put a $1 charge on 10,000 cards."

Small charges are less likely to be noticed and disputed, he says, and a single charge - even if it's for just 99 cents - enables the crooks to resell the stolen information at a premium, according to Samid.

A validated stolen card number is worth more than an untested one, he says.

If you used a credit card at Target, you have more protection than if you used a debit card. That's because consumers are protected from the fraudulent use of a credit card. You still have to report the fraud to your card issuer.

A fraudulent charge is typically credited back to the consumer's account after a fraud report is made. The card issuer then investigates the complaint and, unless the charge is found to be valid, the credit will be made permanent.

With a debit card transaction, money immediately comes from the consumer's bank account. After filing a fraud report with the bank, it is then in the bank's hands when - or if - to return that money.

Either way, if a fraudulent charge is spotted, consumers should get a new card.

But experts say it's better to err on the side of caution, and - at least for debit card holders - get a new card now.

"I do see this as a very severe breach. Take it very seriously," says Mark McCurley, senior information security adviser for Scottsdale, Arizona-based IDT911 Consulting, a company that does data breach prevention and post-breach analysis.

McCurley says he used his debit card at a Target store during the period the numbers were stolen. He requested a new debit card and PIN number.

"That's how seriously I'm taking the matter," he says.

At a minimum, change your PIN number, experts advise. If the thieves have captured your PIN, you can prevent them from getting a cash-back during a transaction or using your card at an ATM machine, McCurley says.

Molly Snyder, a spokeswoman for Target, says there is no indication at this point that PINs were collected by the thieves.

The
 U.S. Secret Service is working on the investigation, according to an 
agency spokeswoman. A Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman 
declined to comment.

"While 
this search for the truth is happening, the issue damages the trust 
Target have gained in mobile and calls into question how sales (will) 
trend in January," said Brian Sozzi, chief executive officer of Belus 
Capital Advisors.

Target spokeswoman said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip and she tried on Friday to downplay the situation

MasterCard
 and Visa officials had declined to comment late on Wednesday, after 
news of the breach surfaced. An American Express spokeswoman said the 
company was aware of the incident and was putting fraud controls in 
place.

The theft is particularly troublesome for Target because it has has used its red branded credit and debit cards as a marketing tool to lure shoppers with a 5 percent discount. As many as 25 per cent of Target shoppers use the store branded cards.

This holiday season, Target added other incentives to use its cards. Two days before Thanksgiving, Target.com ran a special review sale with 25 exclusive offers, from electronics to housewares for those who used the branded card.

Households who activate a Target-branded card have increased their spending at the store by about 50 percent on average, the store says.

'This is how Target is getting more customers in the stores," said Brian Sozzi, CEO and Chief Equities Strategist. "It's telling people to use the card. It's been a big win. If they lose that trust, that person goes to Wal-Mart.'

Target said it had 
alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was 
made aware of the unauthorized access and that it was "putting all 
appropriate resources behind these efforts."

The company said it hired a forensics firm to investigate the incident.

Target's shares were down 1.7 percent an hour before the market was due to open.

The
 shares, which have risen 7.4 percent this year, closed at $63.55 on the
 New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The stock has largely 
underperformed the broader S&P 500 index, which has risen 27 percent
 this year.

Hackers
 usually sell account information on the black market to those who want 
to produce fake cards. Crime rings use the cards to buy gift 
certificates from large stores that they later turn into cash, according
 to investigators.

Target Corp. advised customers to check their statements carefully. Those who see suspicious charges on the cards should report it to their credit card companies and call Target at 866-852-8680.
