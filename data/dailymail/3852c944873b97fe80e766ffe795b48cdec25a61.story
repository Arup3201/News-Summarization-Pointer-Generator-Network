UN narcotics chief: Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool are comparable to Brazil and Mexico for their 'no-go' areas

Badly managed large scale immigration fuels the problem

'Drug traffickers, organised crime, drug users - they take over'

British cities have lawless  ‘no-go 
areas’ comparable with the most dangerous parts of Brazil, Mexico and 
the U.S., according to a United Nations drugs chief.

Professor Hamid Ghodse claimed Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester are on a par with the drug and murder capitals of the world.

The president of the International Narcotics Control Board said the police had lost control of parts of these cities, and drugs gangs had taken over.

Eleven-year-old Rhys Jones was one victim of the drug and gang culture permeating Britain.

The youngster was shot in the car 
park of a pub, in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August 2007 after innocently 
being caught up in a turf war between rival gangs.

Rhys was killed as he walked through a pub car park on his way home from football training.

Sean Mercer, then aged 16, was aiming at members of a rival gang when he blasted Rhys by mistake.

Members of Mercer’s Croxteth Crew helped him cover up his horrific crime.

Rhys was shot with a First World War Smith and Wesson revolver, and a gang-member was caught trying to buy a replacement weapon just weeks later.

Mercer was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years.

But his comments caused fury from police and community leaders.

Tony Lloyd, Labour MP for Manchester Central, said: ‘I walk the streets of  Manchester on a regular basis. It is  not the same as Bogota, it is not the same as Mexico City.

‘He is either ignorant or stupid. If hehas surveyed my city from the decadence of a five-star hotel room then he may well draw those conclusions.

‘If he had come out with me on the streets he would see that people are living happily and peacefully.’

Liverpool council leader Joe Anderson said: ‘Anyone who knows Liverpool will not recognise the city from the way in which this report is being interpreted.

'The comparisons are fanciful and it  is absurd to say any part of the city is  a no-go area.’

Ahead of the publication of the INCB’s annual report on drugs around the world, Professor Ghodse said urgent action was needed because parts of the UK were experiencing ‘social disintegration’.

The Iranian-born doctor claimed that Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester were experiencing ‘a vicious cycle of social exclusion and drugs problems and fractured communities’.

‘In many societies around the world, whether developed or developing, there are communities within the societies which develop which become no-go areas,’ he went on.

‘Drug traffickers, organised crime, drug users, they take over. They will get the sort of governance of those areas.

‘Examples are in Brazil, Mexico, in the United States, in the UK, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, and therefore it is no good to have only law enforcement, which always shows it does not succeed.

‘It is crucial that the needs of communities experiencing social disintegration are urgently tackled before the tipping point is reached, beyond which effective action becomes impossible.

‘The consequences of failure are too high for society and should be avoided at all cost.’

One example of the scourge of drugs in Liverpool was a family of drug dealers and their 
associates, last November were jailed for a total of 82 years for peddling heroin and crack cocaine on the streets of 
Liverpool.

Lisa Whitney and Carol Whitney, part of the 'drug family', were jailed for four and eight years respectively

As the net closed on the drug dealers, 
officers found an SA80 assault rifle which had been stolen from army 
barracks on Salisbury Plain in 2005, around 1,200 rounds of 
ammunition as well as a large quantity of Class A substances.

Thirteen people involved in running a 24-hour drugs cash and carry service were jailed after months of surveillance.

Undercover officers from Merseyside 
Police posed as addicts to make 'test purchases' to gain the necessary 
evidence as undercover officers filmed the footage.

His comments were undermined by statistics showing the wildly differing crime rates between cities in England and South America.

For example, the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, which contains vast sprawling slums, saw 4,631 murders in 2009, including scores at the hands of drug dealers.

In contrast, there were 35  murders in Manchester in 2009-10 – a record low – and 27 in the  West Midlands.

The Greater Manchester police force 
boasts a 96.8 per cent detection rate for murders. Officials in Rio 
estimate there have been 60,000 unsolved murders in the past decade, 
including 24,000 where the body was unidentified.

Senior police officers also dismissed
 the claims. Tim Hollis, the Chief Constable of Humberside and the 
Association of Chief Police Officers’ drugs spokesman said: ‘I simply do
 not recognise the reference to “no-go” areas in the UK. It appears to 
be set in the broader context of social cohesion.’

Assistant Chief Constable Steve 
Heywood of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘I am sure that the majority 
of people in Manchester will wholeheartedly reject any suggestion that 
parts of the city are “no-go” areas.

‘We
 accept that drugs are a major driving force behind many other crimes 
such as burglary, robbery and vehicle crime, and that is why we are 
determined to root out all those involved’.

Merseyside Police said it ‘absolutely disagreed’ there are any ‘no-go areas’ in Liverpool or elsewhere in the force area.

Illegal internet pharmacies are targeting
 young people online through sites such as Facebook and YouTube, a 
United Nations drugs chief warned today.

Professor Hamid Ghodse, president of the UN’s International Narcotics 
Control Board (INCB), said illegal internet pharmacies were becoming 
'very sophisticated' in approaching young people on social media sites, 
leaving them 'very vulnerable' online.

He warned young people to be aware of whom they were talking to and interacting with on the internet.

'Disturbingly, illegal internet pharmacies have started to use social 
media to publicise their websites, which can put large audiences at risk
 of dangerous products,' Prof Ghodse said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has found more than half of medicines from internet pharmacies are counterfeit, he added.

'This has become really rather sinister now,' he said, 'it is much more widespread than you can believe it is.

'International illicit pharmacies are using social media and they are 
not just coming overtly as they used to do, advertising their selling of
 illicit drugs to you, they do it under a variety (of different ways).

'They use YouTube, they use Facebook, they attract you to their website 
... Then when you go there you will see they are also selling illicit 
drugs.

'Particularly young people, they become very vulnerable in using internet pharmacies.'

Prof Ghodse went on: 'A few years ago it was direct, it was the internet selling all sorts of controlled drugs.

'But now actually they are using the social media, engaging people in a 
variety of ways which in the first instance you do not see they are 
marketing the drug.

'But then, in a very sophisticated way, they are getting the right 
question on to YouTube, on to Facebook, and even chatting in the 
chatrooms, they get engaged, and then bombard them with drugs.'

The INCB annual report added that the illegal firms took steps to ensure
 they looked legitimate, 'providing quotes and images of purported 
medical doctors'.

But it added that the firms had turned to 'message board and social 
network advertising' after several internet search engines banned the 
use of registered trademarks for prescription drugs in their sponsored 
links.

More than half (58 per cent) of the 12,000 seizures of controlled substances 
sent via the mail in 2010 were from India, with others from the US, 
China and Poland, and 'some of course in the UK', Prof Ghodse added.
