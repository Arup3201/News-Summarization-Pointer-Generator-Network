They are the perfect autumnal scenes, showing the great British countryside off to its best.

With a swan gliding effortlessly on a lake in Sussex against a stunning backdrop of red, and deer grazing in the Scottish Highlands, these photographs paint a perfect picture of the country.

However, these scenes are unlikely to continue as a huge band of rain looks set to sweep its way across the UK from tonight.

The band of rain will hit north-west Scotland early evening tonight and then move across the UK finishing up in south-east on Saturday.

On higher ground in western Scotland, north Wales and north west England, some places could see up to 30mm of rain.

However, it is not all bad news.

As the band of rain moves diagonally across the country, it will be swiftly followed by brighter spells of sunshine. This will see some parts of the UK bathed in sunshine on Saturday with many places nice and sunny on Sunday.

Speaking this evening, Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 'It will be pretty wet in some areas tomorrow.

'We have a band of rain coming into the far north west of Scotland tonight but this will head south through tomorrow and fragment a bit.Â 

'Some areas on higher ground could see 20 to 30mm of rain.

'The rain will affect central England by late Friday and then clear through by Saturday morning. By mid Saturday it should have left most areas but it could linger in the far south east.'

However, despite this gloomy prediction, the weather is expected to brighten as the weekend progresses.

'The weekend does not look to bad for many places once the band of rain comes through on Saturday,' said Mr Williams.

Wet: It is expected that some higher parts of the UK could see up to 30mm of rain over the next two days

Feisty: The rutting season sees the large red deer stags compete against each other for mating rights

Brighter: Despite the predicted rain, many areas of the UK will brighten over Saturday and Sunday

'As that band of rain comes through, behind it will be brighter spells of weather.

'There
will be more bright spells on Saturday but it will be a better day on 
Sunday with dry and bright spells of sunshine over the eastern side of the 
UK.

'It is pretty decent for this time of year.'

These stunning images show the traditional autumnal scenes of the rutting season with large red deer stags competing against each other for mating rights.

They can be heard roaring and bellowing in an attempt to attract females.

The rut draws to a close in early November when the males will then 
spend the winter feeding to regain strength for the following year's 
season.

Boost: By Sunday, southern central areas of the UK are expected to see the brightest weather

Nice: Sunday will see many bright spells across the UK. Red deer are pictured looking at the photographer in the Scottish Highlands today
