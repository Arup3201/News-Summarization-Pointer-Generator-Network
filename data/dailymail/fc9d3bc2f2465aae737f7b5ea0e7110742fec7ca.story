Young students at an elite private school have been terrorised by older boys who woke them in the middle of the night and dragged them from their dorm rooms as part of a traumatic hazing ritual.

The principal of King's College in Auckland, NZ, said he was going to look 'deeply' into the incident which saw students walked through the grounds of the school with pillow cases over their heads in the early hours of the morning.

The scarring ceremony was carried out by six Year 12 students, who marched the students around one of the boarding houses at 3.30am last Thursday, Stuff.co.nz reported.

During the ordeal a 'prank' was apparently played, where the older boys hit themselves while another student yelled out - designed to scare the younger students into thinking some of their peers were being tortured.

Another student - in Year 13 - is said to have hit one of the younger boys on the back of the legs during the horrible event.

The house master was made aware of the incident almost immediately after it happened, when other students reported it. 

All seven of the perpetrators have been suspended for the time being and will face a meeting with the school's disciplinary board in coming days.

One parent told of the torture his son went through at the $37,000 a year school, who along with his peers was screaming in fear while totally disoriented.

'Apparently the idea was to scare them,' he told the website. 

Students were marched through the boarding house with pillowcases over their heads before they were further terrorised 

'But as you can imagine the young boys were disoriented, they couldn't see anything.

'They thought they were going to be beaten up.'

The school's principal Michael Leach has only been in the top job for a few weeks, but said he would take a strong stance against the hazing ceremony, adding he had not heard of any similar occurrences at the college. 

Leach said 'Bullying can't be tolerated in any form' and empathised with parents who were upset by the incident.

He also revealed that no formal complaints had been made by any parents as of yet, and that counselling would be offered to all the young students involved. 

All the victims were also being interviewed about what happened during the night, and all families of the Year 9 students had been notified.
