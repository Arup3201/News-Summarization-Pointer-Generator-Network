Julian Fellowes is sure to alarm fans of Downton Abbey as he suggests the latest series may be its final.

The screenwriter has been commissioned to create what has been dubbed the American version of of the ITV1 show, but plans have been put on hold.

'It will happen when Downton finishes, because I just couldn't do both at once... I don't know yet if there is a season six, but it's not going to go on forever,' he said.

Julian Fellowes can't get started on his latest project while working on Downton Abbey

The period drama made its debut in 2010, telling story of the aristocratic Crawley family. It is set to return to screens later this year for its fifth series.

But Fellowes' latest bombshell which hints at Downton's possible demise will not come as good news to ITV1 executives. The show has been one of the channel's biggest hits in recent years.

The screenwriter admits there is no way he could continue to write it while working on his next major project, The Gilded Age, for which he was commissioned almost a year ago by American TV network NB

Production is currently being held up by Fellowes's commitment to Downton, he reveals in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal.

Downton Abbey will return for a fifth series later this year - but Fellowes has suggested it may be its last

'I haven't written [The Gilded Age] yet' he confesses.

'But it's about the old aristocracy, the Winthrops and the Stuyvesants and the new money of oil and gas and shipping in the 1870s. It will all be fiction – it won't be real people – but when those families descended on New York, they took over.'

Fellowes previously said of The Gilded Age that it will chart 'the dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls' of New York society in late 19th century.

It is being billed by NBC as ‘an epic tale of the princes of the American Renaissance and the vast fortunes made - and spent - in late 19th- century New York’.

'This was a vivid time in America,' said Fellowes. 'There was record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry, in a time when money was king.'

It had been suggested that Fellowes could hand over the main Downton writing responsibilities to others while he embarks on the American show. But in his latest interview he suggests that is out of the question, revealing that he writes alone, bouncing ideas only off his wife.

Meanwhile, ITV tell MailOnline: 'No decision has been made on when Downton Abbey will end'.
