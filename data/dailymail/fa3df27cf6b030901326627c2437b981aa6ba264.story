Spanish full-back Alberto Moreno has signed for Liverpool in a £12million deal.

The transfer was agreed in principal earlier this week but it has taken until now for the club to officially unveil him. 

The 22-year-old has enjoyed a considerable rise to prominence in the past two years - winning the Under 21 European Championships with Spain in 2013, and then breaking in to Sevilla's first team.

Moreno won the Europa League with Sevilla last season, and was spotted in tears after the UEFA Super Cup final on Tuesday.

The Spanish international was pulled from Sevilla's starting line-up to face Real Madrid in Cardiff and bade a tearful farewell to fans and team-mates after the 2-0 defeat.

'I am living a strange situation because I'm leaving the club of my life,' Moreno told ABC de Sevilla earlier this week.

'I was always aware of the two teams (trying) to agree (a deal). I never got into that but Sevilla have understood that Liverpool's offer was good and I am going.'

Moreno will compete with compatriots Jose Enrique and Javier Manquillo for a starting berth in Brendan Rodgers' side.

Moreno also spoke of his joy at having joined such a big club. 

The defender told AS: 'Apart from being a big club historically, I know people here live football in a unique way. In my opinion, Liverpool is the best club in England and I could not miss the opportunity to come and play here.'

He also admitted that Xabi Alonso and Pepe Reina had both recommended Liverpool to him and told 

him it would be a 'great opportunity to grow as a player.'
