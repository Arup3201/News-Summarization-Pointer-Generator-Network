A glossy pair of stockings was enough to seduce Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.

And teamed with a well-cut dress and spritz of perfume, they are the perfect ingredients to make a lady feel her best.

Dustin Hoffman was seduced by the stocking wearing Mrs Robinson in the 1967 film, The Graduate

The stockings are laced with the chemicals which are designed to increase sexual attraction

But now women can skip one of those 
steps – with the introduction of scented stockings that claim to give 
extra sex appeal. The Hush Hush range by hosiery firm Ballerina, available at Lovehoney.com for £19.99, is laced
 with female pheromones believed to send men as wild as Hoffman in the 
1967 film.

A spokesman for Ballerina said: ‘Pheromones send out subconscious signals to the opposite sex.’

But while pheromones are emitted in our sweat glands, style mavens may be relieved to know the stockings’ ones are synthetic.

And it is not just the chaps who respond to pheromones. A study found women rated men as more attractive if a cloth soaked in male sweat was hidden nearby.

Stockings have had a special sense of allure since The Graduate, where Hoffman played misanthropic young man, fresh out of college and with no direction in life. He finds himself seduced by the older Mrs Robinson, a friend on his parents, and gets drawn in to a short, if tawdry, affair.

In one particularly intimate scene, Mrs Robinson - played by Ann Bancroft - slowly pulls on a pair of stockings while Hoffman watches on.
