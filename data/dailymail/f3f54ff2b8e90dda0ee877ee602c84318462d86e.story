A mother is demanding an apology from a trendy bar after claiming she and her  friends were turned away for being 'too fat and ugly'.

Stacey Owen was enjoying a night out with her two friends when she says her group was barred from entering Neighbourhood bar, in Spinningfields, Manchester, because of their weight and looks.

The 33-year-old said the trio had arranged to meet a friend inside the bar but when they tried to walk in, they were held back by security staff who said it was too full.

Stacey Owen claims she was enjoying a night out with friends and decided to head to the Neighbourhood bar

'After a while a group of lads went in and the doormen said it was because there were too many women in and they try to balance the ratio so we thought "fine",' Stacey said.

However, the mother-of-one claims she and her friends became suspicious when they saw some other women walking straight into the bar.

'Then a group of women went in and we said "hang on what’s going on?" and he turned to us and said "look, you’re too big and ugly to come in, I suggest you try elsewhere".

'I couldn’t believe what I’d just heard and asked him if he could say it again to make sure - he repeated "you’re too fat, you’re not getting in".

'I know I’m not exactly a supermodel, but I’ve never known anything like it in terms of customer service,' she said.

'We were so shocked we didn’t know what to do. It was so uncalled for and I’ve never had anything so humiliating happen to me in my whole life.

'For us the night was completely ruined and we just went home.' 

The travel rep, who lives in the Droylsden area of Manchester, said she and her friends were left feeling insulted and she said the least Neighbourhood bosses could do was to apologise.

'I’ve been in touch to report the incident since and ask for an apology but they don’t seem interested and I’ve had no response,' she said.

'I certainly won’t be going back and wanted to draw attention to it because I don’t think they should be allowed to speak to people like that.”

The alleged incident on Saturday comes just a week after a hen party said they were called "chav cheap trash" and "peasants" by staff at city centre restaurant 47 King Street West in Manchester after posting a negative review online.

Lawyers for the owners insist that staff at Neighbourhood are not rude or abusive to guests and Ms Owen' s claims are strongly denied.
