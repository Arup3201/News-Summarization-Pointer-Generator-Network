Sacking Harry Redknapp on the back of Saturday’s defeat against Manchester United would be harsh.

If QPR chairman Tony Fernandes was looking at their performance against Manchester United for reasons to pull the trigger then he needed to look pretty hard.

This wasn’t the performance of a side who aren’t in tune with their manager, just one lacking attacking invention.

On the evidence of Saturday’s display, QPR players are very much with their underfire manager.

Nevertheless, there are still figures within the Loftus Road hierarchy who believe Redknapp’s time should be up.

For them, their woeful away form is simply not good enough. For them, his constant reference to the club being able to sign only loan players this month is an excuse to hide the deficiencies of the previous transfer window.

For them, QPR will be relegated if the club decide against making a change and see now as the perfect time.

Following their exit from the FA Cup, Rangers now have just under two weeks until their next Premier League clash against Stoke.

From the outside looking in it seems there is no time like the present to make a managerial change early this week.

Fernandes, so far, has backed his manager and resisted any urge to make a change, despite people telling him otherwise.

The formation of Redknapp’s substitutes bench on Saturday wouldn’t have helped the manager’s cause, though. Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker were both there, having arrived in the summer. Fellow summer signing Jordon Mutch didn’t even make the matchday squad, while Sandro, who had a history of knee problems during his time at Spurs, remains unavailable — with a knee injury.

Goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, signed from Reading, is still second choice to veteran keeper Rob Green and loan signing Mauro Zarate is yet to feature, having joined from West Ham earlier this month.

So, with that in mind, Redknapp’s hurry to point out that the club can only afford to sign loan players this month has not gone down too well among members of the Loftus Road hierarchy.

Having spoken to Fernandes on the phone last week, Redknapp has been assured his job isn’t under threat.

However, should Fernandes start listening to some of the dissenting voices, that could yet change.
