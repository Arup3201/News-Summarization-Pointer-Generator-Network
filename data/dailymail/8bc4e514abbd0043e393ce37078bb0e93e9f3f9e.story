A road trip turned into a tragic accident after a four-wheel-drive rolled when the driver swerved to avoid a rabbit on a road, north of Melbourne.

The group of seven friends were travelling home from a Bendigo visit before the driver lost control on the Calder Freeway just south of Macedon Woodend Road just after 11pm on Friday.

Anthony Nguyen, 19, from Richmond died at the scene while his friend, Joey Nguyen, 17, also from Richmond was flown to the Alfred Hospital but later died from head injuries.

Police said the driver, a 20-year-old from Glenroy, suffered minor injuries and was taken to the Western Hospital.

Speaking from his hospital bed, Steven Luu, 17, from Kensington told News.com.au that the group of friends knew each other from Hawthorn Secondary College, which is now closed.

'We were just coming back from Bendigo for a visit, it was a place we wanted to go,' he said.

'A rabbit ran on the road. It’s really tragic what happened, they were such good friends. I’m still in a bit of shock.'

The other four passengers were taken to hospital for minor injuries, including the driver, a 20-year-old from Glenroy, an 18-year-old Richmond man, a 20-year-old Ascot Vale man and a 21-year-old Chadstone man.

Police do not believe alcohol was the factor but will investigate whether speed, fatigue or drugs were involved

Sargent Yeoman said he was surprised that the surviving victims only had minor injuries

Nina Lambert, who was a witness at the scene, told News.com.au that she cradled Joey's head and told him to stay awake while she waited for paramedics.

'I was telling him to just hang on, to breathe through it,' she said.

'I had to hold him down...there were a couple of times he actually tried to get up. I was trying to keep him calm. I felt helpless.'

Detective Sargent David Yeoman said it appeared the driver had swerved to avoid a hazard.

'Early indications are that there’s some sort of distraction — or need to evade something on the road,' Sgt Yeoman said.

'We are still investigating the cause and it will include things like distraction or drugs or speed or fatigue; those sorts of things are routine matters for us and we’ll establish the cause in due course but at the moment it’s still under investigation

Sargent Yeoman said he was surprised that the surviving victims only had minor injuries.

'It’s quite surprising if you look at the damage of the car,' he said.

Police do not believe alcohol was the factor but will investigate whether speed, fatigue or drugs were involved.

'It was very clear and it wasn't wet and the road condition is very very good, so we're at a bit of a loss to find out exactly what caused this, but we will get to the bottom of it,' Sargent Yeoman said.
