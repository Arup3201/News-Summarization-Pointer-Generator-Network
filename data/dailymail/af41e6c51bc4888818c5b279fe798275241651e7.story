Surveillance video from the lobby of an Atlantic City casino released Friday shows what happened after disgraced NFL star Ray Rice knocked out his wife-to-be.

The footage from inside the now-defunct Revel Casino obtained exclusively by ABC News shows a distraught Janay Palmer, Rice's now-wife, refusing to talk to the Baltimore Ravens player after getting punched in the face inside the elevator moments earlier.

The woman is seen in the video pushing away the 5-foot-8, 206-pound athlete when he tries to come near her.

Aftermath: Extended CCTV footage from inside Revel Casino shows what happened after Ray Rice punched his then-fiancee inside an elevator

Silent treatment: Janay Palmer, dressed in pink and seen from the back, at first refuses to talk to her fiance, who sits at a distance and glares at her

In custody: Ray Rice is seen being led away in handcuffs by police after the elevator attack  

All's forgiven? Although Janay Palmer initially appears to be angry at Rice, later in the video she is seen kissing and nuzzling him on the neck (pictured left and right)  

Security guards at the hotel then come to Palmer's defense and shield her from Rice.

Hotel staffers are seen bringing a wheelchair for Palmer in case she has trouble walking after the elevator attack.

All the while, Rice is seated to one side glancing anxiously at his fiancee.

The 45-minute never-before-seen tape, which has been edited down to just over 2 minutes by ABC, also shows how Janay Palmer's demeanor changes over time, going from furious to emotional, and ultimately to forgiving.

When Rice is escorted out of the hotel and casino in handcuffs, his fiancee is seen kissing and nuzzling him on the neck in an elevator. 

Rice and Palmer were each charged with assault, but the count against the woman was later dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence. 

The Ravens star was indicted on an an upgraded charge of aggravated assault, but instead of serving time he was allowed to enter a pretrial prevention program, which would allow his criminal record to be expunged.

Shocking footage: It comes two months after the footballer was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer  with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino

Knocked out: After this elevator security video of the altercation surfaced in September, the Baltimore Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, before the NFL suspended him indefinitely

According to ABC News, Rice tried to block the new outlet from obtaining the extended surveillance video showing the aftermath of the attack, but ultimately lost.

'This is a time of healing and he, quite naturally, doesn’t want another media showing of what must have been the worst event of his life,' Rice's attorney Peter Ginsberg said. 'What the media ought to be focusing on is the issue of domestic violence and why the NFL never did anything to construct a personal conduct program that works and why the NFL ignored the issue of domestic violence. Showing yet another Ray Rice video is simply a distraction.'

Ray Rice was suspended from the NFL indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer on the morning of February 15 with his left fist in an elevator at Revel Casino in Atlantic City. 

The suspension was lifted last month, clearing the way for the 27-year-old athlete to join any team.  

'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore during a charity event Thursday, just one day before the release of the extended CCTV video.

Initially, Rice was sidelined by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancee.

However, after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.

Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. 

During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice.

Last month, Palmer - now Janay Rice - spoke to ESPN about the Atlantic City incident, saying it stemmed from an 'insignificant' argument between her and her husband.

She told the broadcaster: 'As we were arguing, he was on his phone and not looking at me. I went to reach for his phone, and when he grabbed it back, he spit at me and I slapped him.

'We got into the elevator and what happened inside is still foggy to me. The only thing I know - and I can't even say I "remember" because I only know from what Ray has told me - is that I slapped him again and then he hit me. I remember nothing else from inside the elevator.'

After coming round in the casino lobby, surrounded by police, Palmer was taken to the police station with her husband, who kept telling her 'It's going to be okay. We'll be okay'. 

Explaining her decision for standing by Rice, she said although she was 'angry', she 'knew it wasn't him' and he had never acted like that before. 

'No matter how long we have known each other and no matter what the circumstance is, Ray understands that violent behavior like this, even one time, is never acceptable,' she said.
