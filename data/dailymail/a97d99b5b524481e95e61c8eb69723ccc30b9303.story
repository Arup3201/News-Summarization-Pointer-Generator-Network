A young father bled to death after impaling himself on broken glass after he slipped while trying to climb through a window into his own home.

The lifeless body of 28-year-old Kyle Fortunato was discovered by his girlfriend, Mariko Laurin, hanging over the kitchen window sill at their home in Scaramento, California.

Fortunato, who was the father of an 18-month-old girl, and worked as a landscaper had managed to get half way through the ground-floor kitchen window, despite it being only 12 inches wide, before getting stuck on shattered glass.

The Sacramento Coroner’s 
Office said the death was accidental and that Fortunato 
had been locked out of his own apartment and in an attempt to get back 
in he tried to crawl in through a kitchen window where he bled to death.

A large crowd gathered on the street 
in front of the house in the North Highlands district. Some even brought
binoculars and young children to ogle at the gruesome scene. 

Rumours quickly spread with some 
people insisting they had heard gunshots being fired and others 
suggesting there had been an argument.

In an open first floor window a torn 
blind could be seen hanging out with some suggesting that the 
28-year-old had jumped, but the coroner disputed that claim.

'And while police too are adamant there was no foul play involved, some neighbours remained suspicious.

It don't seem like no accident to me,’ one told CBS Sacramento. ‘I mean, I ain't no CSI, but I watch CSI.’

But Ms Laurin, mother to Fortunato’s 
daughter, took to Facebook to refute these claims.

She wrote: ‘I don't want you to believe the vicious 
rumours of a “lover's spat” between us.

‘It was an unfortunate accident that he was taken from us too soon.'

Gossip: Rumours spread, with some claiming to have heard gunshots fired. Others said they thought he had fallen from this open window

Yesterday, candles and teddy bears were left outside the home.

A family friend who dod not give her name told CBS: 'She loved him and he loved her. They were a family.'

A neighbour told the station: 'He was a nice guy, he went to work.'
