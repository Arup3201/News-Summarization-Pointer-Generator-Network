She may have been under pressure as she took part in the Badminton Horse Trials, but Zara Philips had her family there to cheer her on.

The 31-year old equestrian’s brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn took their young daughters Savannah, two, and one-year-old Isla to enjoy the show.

The Queen’s great-grand children were cared for by their aunt as the royal took time out of her day to check that they were warm and having a good time.

The girls, who are 12th and 13th in line for the throne, played in the sunshine as they watched their aunt Zara compete.

Zara, who is married to English rugby player Mike Tindall, has been participating in the competition, which continues with cross country tomorrow and show jumping on Monday.

The Queen’s eldest granddaughter posted a dressage score of 44.3 penalties today that kept her firmly in touch with the leading group.

Reflecting on British equestrian’s feelgood factor post-London, the team silver medal winner said: ‘Everyone who was there at London, and those of us who were lucky enough to be able to ride there, it was just the most amazing experience. We want to try to keep that going.’

The sportswoman also saluted the ‘unbelievable’ achievement of her fellow British Olympian William Fox-Pitt and New Zealander Andrew Nicholson in challenging for eventing’s richest prize.

Not only are they bidding for Badminton’s £65,000 winners’ purse, but also the £230,000 Rolex Grand Slam.

The Grand Slam has only been won once before - by Britain’s Pippa Funnell 10 years ago.

It is awarded to any rider who wins consecutive Burghley, Kentucky and Badminton titles.

Zara said: ‘To maintain your performance at the top level is difficult anyway, but to do it in three of the five competitions is unbelievable.

‘But everyone is going to be trying to stop them. They are going to have to put their best performances out there to try to win it.’
