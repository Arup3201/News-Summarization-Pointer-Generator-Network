A grandmother has become 'trapped in World War Two' after a police car ploughed into her back garden.

The terrifying moment has sent Eileen Lee, 76, into shock and she now panics at the slightest noise.

The grandmother now crouches on the ground with her hands over her head when she hears a noise, repeatedly shouting: 'Run for cover, the bombs are dropping.'

Eileen Lee's daughter Maxine says she was fine before the accident but is now trapped in a 1940s time warp

Her daughter Maxine says she was fine before the accident, on August 22, but is now stuck in a 1940s time warp where she believes the country is being attacked and confuses hospitals with air raid shelters.

She says her mother, who survived a Second World War bomb which destroyed her family’s Bromley home, was watching television and had let her pomeranian dog Coco out in the back garden of her home in Sydenham, south London.

A police car had been about to pursue a motorbike in Sydenham but overturned and slammed into the retired fashion worker's garden fence.

Her daughter, who claims police have 
been uncooperative since the accident, said: 'Mum thought it was bombs 
and she’s gone into complete shock.

'It wrecked the garden completely. When she saw it was a police car she thought her dog was underneath it.'

When Maxine Lee, 49, arrived she walked into chaotic scenes, quickly discovering her mum was not her usual self.

She said: 'With all the fire engines, ambulances, and road closures it was like something out of a movie. It was the worst experience of both our lives.

'But when more police arrived they didn’t even offer mum a cup of tea.'

Now Ms Lee says the grandmother-of-two has developed psychiatric problems, even cowering when there’s a knock on the door.

She said: 'It’s taken my mum right back to the war days.

'When she’s in hospital she thinks she’s in air raid shelters. She doesn’t know where she is or who people are.

'It must have been the impact - the noise, the banging, the smashing of glass - which has caused this.'

Ms Lee is now looking for legal help, claiming police treated her mum in an offhand way, not apologising for the accident and leaving the garden unsecured for three days.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We have launched a full investigation into the collision between a police vehicle and a residential fence on 22 August 2012.

'A senior officer has met with Eileen Lee and her family to discuss the matter.'
