In a world of countless Snapchat rivals and photo sharing services, new apps are having to come up with original ways to stand out.

The free Tiiny app attempts to do this by letting users share photos and short video clips with friends, but with a difference - each post is just 212 pixels tall x 212 pixels wide.

These files appear as small thumbnails in a stream of images from friends, and after 24 hours, every post is automatically deleted.

The app uses the front-facing camera by default and users can only take new photos or videos – existing images can’t be upload them from the phone’s gallery, and the videos aren't uploaded with sound.

Users can either connect their Twitter account to the app, to find friends who are already using it, or sign up via email.

The tiny posts appear in a grid-style feed, alongside other photos and videos posted by friends.

Although the posts can’t be expanded, other users can still ‘Like’ them.

Each post has the user’s name and brief bio information, including the number of likes that particular post has received.

Users can additionally browse the Popular page to see the most liked posts worldwide.

The most recent posts also appear on an individual’s profile page.

And 24 hours after the original post is uploaded, it is automatically deleted.

However, the single app review on the App Store, at the time of writing, calls Tiiny ‘Cute, but pointless.’

There has been an influx of Snapchat rivals recently, including Facebook’s Slingshot, and Instagram’s Bolt.

Apple’s latest iOS 8 software also features a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video and audio messages.

Earlier this month, 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco unveiled her Ansa app.

However, unlike Snapchat, Ansa lets users delete messages remotely, from another person’s device, before they get a chance to read it.

Elsewhere, GIFs are similarly growing in popularity and the Relay messaging app only lets users communicate in GIFs. 

A GIF- short for graphical interchange format - is a bitmap image format that supports short animations.

Relay allows anyone to search a library for GIFs that reflect their state of mind.

The GIFs are placed into categories such as 'bored', 'hungover', 'grumpy', 'happy' and 'excited' and users can send their chosen mini-movie to other Relay users.

For instance, if a user wants to show their excitement, GIFs such as a dancing Kermit the frog appear in the search results.
