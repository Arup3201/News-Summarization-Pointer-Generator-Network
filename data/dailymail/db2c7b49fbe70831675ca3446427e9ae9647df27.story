A branch of hacker group Anonymous has taken on the people they believe are involved in the cover up of a horrific rape case in Ohio where two star football players are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.

The alleged rape took place in Steubenville, Ohio in August of last year, but because authorities did not immediately arrest the athletes involved, much of the policing has been done on the web.

Officially, two boys- Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond- have been arrested and charged with raping a fellow 16-year-old, taking her to a number of parties when she was too drunk to resist, digitally penetrating her and possibly even urinating on her.

Taking action: The so-called 'hacktivist' group Anonymous made a video announcing their plan to 'out' people involved in the alleged coverup of the incident

The case, which was publicized nationally by an explosive New York Times story, has split the small town of Steubenville into two sides- those who are devout fans of the football team who have chosen to support the two players, saying that the incident is the girl's fault for getting that drunk. There is also the allegation that she was drugged, but because a toxicology report was not done immediately after the alleged assault, that has not been proven.

Others feel that the reason why the case 
has not moved more swiftly through the legislative process is because 
local officials are covering up for the start athletes, taking it as the
 latest example of the hero-worship provided the teenage football 
players.

Horrific: Attendees at the various parties posted pictures of the two suspects dragging the seemingly unconscious victim around because she was too drunk to move

Anonymous qualifies as the latter, and an individual cell called Knight Sec has appointed themselves that internet vigilantes for the case.

On their website, called Local Leaks: The Steubenville Files, they said that they took up the cause since 'a town rife with corruption, cronyism, illegal gambling  and fixated upon their star high school football team (a major economic revenue engine) were prepared to orchestrate a major cover-up in order to sweep the entire affair under the rug.'

The group 'began unraveling this conspiracy of silence designed to protect a group of these high school football players who had become well known to their fellow students as “The Rape Crew”.'

They go on to name and discredit a number of people involved in the case- from the sheriff involved in the investigation to the prosecuting attorney- using their tech skills to hack into individuals email accounts and publish damaging allegations. In the case of a prominent football team supporter, the group published inappropriate and pornographic photos found in his email account.

The Local Leaks site has become somewhat of a collection of the various Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter posts made by students who were either present at the parties where the girl was being dragged around by the two players by her ankles and wrists.

That picture was originally screen-grabbed by Alexandria Goddard, a crime blogger who used to live in Steubenville. She took it from the Instagram account of a local high school student who later tried to sue her for defamation because she posted the photo on the web.

His suit was dismissed and the teenage boy publicly apologized to the victim and her family, whose names are not being reported because she is a minor and an alleged sexual assault victim.

A horrifying online trail of the August 11 incident continues to emerge, and one of the latest discoveries was that of a video of a group of high school students talking about- even laughing- about the alleged rape which seems to be happening at the time the video was shot.

Throughout the video, which is just over 12 minutes long, there are numerous references to a 'dead girl' who is described as being raped and urinated on.

The boy who talks the most in the video has been identified as Michael Nodianos, a former Steubenville student and baseball player who cannot contain his laughter as he describes the 16-year-old victim, seemingly in another room of the house, being raped.

'She is so raped right now,' he says at one point in the video.

Offensive: A number of offensive comments about the alleged rape were made online, including this one on Twitter; detectives are now trawling through the online exchanges for more evidence

'There won't be any foreplay for a dead girl,' he says. 'It ain't wet now to be honest. Trust me, I'm a doctor.'

The video was obtained by hacker group KnightSec and posted on Deadspin on Wednesday.

Wearing an Ohio State Buckeyes t-shirt, Nodianos jokes that the girl is 'deader than a doornail' and 'they p***** on her.'

He then goes on a tirade of the 
figures that she's 'deader than,' including Caylee Anthony, 'O.J. 
Simpson's wife,' John F. Kennedy and Trayvon Martin.

Allegation: Both of the boys facing charges are students at Steubenville High School and were on the school's prestigious football team

The city’s police chief begged for witnesses to come forward, but received little response.

At least two other people who don't 
appear on camera interrupt Nodianos to let inform him that the situation
 is anything but a laughing matter.

'It is rape. They raped her,' one of them says.

Later, he chastises Nodianos, saying: 'Like, this is not like funny... what if that was your daughter?'

Nodianos responds: 'But it isn't. If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I would just let her be dead.

'And is it really rape if you don’t 
know if she wanted to or not? She might have wanted it. That might have 
been her final wish.'

The names Trent and Ma'lik, are also 
mentioned in the video - the names of the suspects in the case - Trent 
Mays and Ma'lik Richmond.
