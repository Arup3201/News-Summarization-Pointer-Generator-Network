His first outing on Hampden’s glistening new track could hardly have gone better, but Chris O’Hare still wasn’t completely happy with his performance.

‘I can’t be mad with it because it was a personal best, but if I’d held back a bit on the back straight and really gone for it with 200 metres to go then I think I could have maybe gone 3.33 high/3.34 low,’ he says of his 1,500m display at the Glasgow Grand Prix meeting, which saw him finish fifth in a time of 3:35.06.

Such is life when you’re a young athlete looking to scale new heights in front of an expectant home crowd in the biggest event of your career.

Going for gold: Chris O'Hare will compete for Team Scotland in the 1,500m at the Commonwealth Games

Cycling innovator Sir Dave Brailsford calls them ‘marginal gains’, the tiny details which can all add up to a huge performance. As O’Hare gears up for Glasgow 2014, he’s all too aware of just how important even the smallest of changes can be.

‘I always seem to come out of a season thinking: “If I’d done something a wee bit different, I could have maybe run a second faster”,’ he admits. ‘I’m the least patient person when it comes to running.

‘Patience is key, though, over the 1,500m as you only get one or two moves and, if you do them at the wrong time, then you’re out of luck. I need to be a bit more patient in a championship setting.

‘I’m happy with where I’m at physically and I just have a couple of things I need to tune up. I need to get my head sorted out and prepare myself for being patient, basically.

‘At the Diamond League, I got excited and went for it with 300m to go because the crowd were going crazy and I thought: “I’m just going for it”. But that’s then probably the biggest lesson I’ll take away from it - to not let the crowd influence my moves.’

The final stages of ‘tuning up’ will take place largely at Team Scotland’s athletics base in Kilmarnock, where the 23-year-old from West Linton will join up with a squad which clearly means business.

As a sign of their growing strength, seven Scots - including O’Hare and fellow 1,500m runner Jake Wightman - have been included in the Great Britain squad for next month’s European Championships.

‘I remember saying this time last year that British athletes in general have really stepped their game up,’ continues O’Hare. ‘They knew that Glasgow was what they wanted to do and that’s what they’ve put all of their efforts into. Everyone has done a good job of preparing themselves.

‘This is by far the strongest Scotland team that I’ve seen going to a Commonwealth Games - and by far the most professional.

‘I’m excited to go to Glasgow and be part of that team that has expectations and nobody’s scared to say: “I want to be in the final”. That’s great to see.

‘Yes, it’s going to be great being in Hampden but we’re looking to that as an inspiration to go above and beyond what’s expected of us.’

O’Hare was hugely impressed by his first visit to the home of Scottish football in its current guise as an athletics arena, but it wasn’t the only thing with a Caledonian background to have caught his attention.

The 20-year-old Wightman was on his shoulder at the finish line and O’Hare could not be more enthusiastic about the ‘Scottish 1,500m force’ which is beginning to emerge.

‘He’s three years younger than me, so to see him running that time was fantastic,’ he adds. ‘He’s a massively talented guy and he’s raced a lot this year and, at that age, that’s sometimes what you need to do.

‘He qualified outright for the Commonwealths and he’s qualified comfortably for the Europeans. It’s exciting to be part of a Scottish 1,500m force that is coming through and, more importantly, a massive step up in British 1,500m running.’

Provided everything goes to plan, O’Hare’s big moment will come on the last night of the athletics competition in Glasgow. It’s the same session in which Usain Bolt is expected to run for Jamaica in the 4 x100m relay, so the recipe of a world superstar strutting his stuff and a Scottish hope aiming to medal could be something for a capacity crowd to feast on.

As you would expect from someone so focused, however, O’Hare is not getting ahead of himself.

‘Yes, that’s if I make the final, which is the first step on the agenda,’ he says. ‘When you go and have a good run and you’re down the back straight with someone like Silas Kiplagat, everybody steps their expectations up for you.

‘It’s a fantastic opportunity and I think everybody will be thinking: “I don’t want to look back when I retire and think I could have done a whole lot better in Glasgow”.

Excited: O'Hare is looking forward to running in front of an expectant home crowd at Glasgow's Hampden Park
