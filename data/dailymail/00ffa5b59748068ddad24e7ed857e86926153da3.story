A former Nasa scientist has created the ultimate naff Christmas jumper for smartphone fans - which features a 'live' flickering log fire.

Mark Rober spent nine years working on Nasa's Curiosity Rover which landed on Mars last year but has now quit the space agency for a career in e-commerce.

He designs and sells innovative fashion items and his new range of knitted festive pullovers feature a small pouch at the front of each jumper, which can accommodate a smartphone.

A free app displays a flickering fire on the screen of the phone to give the appearance of real logs burning, which can be displayed in the knitted fireplace.

There are five different jumpers available. Two of the pullovers display a roaring log fire while another has a cat wearing a Christmas hat blinking and moving its mouth.

A different design has a snow globe with a blizzard inside and the final jumper shows a creepy Father Christmas.

The jumpers cost between £34.95 and £39.95 and are available from the Digital Dudz website. They have also available at Asda this weekend for £16.

Mr Rober, from Los Angeles, uploaded a series of videos of the jumpers in action to his YouTube channel and thousands of people have already viewed them.

'Two years ago I released a video of my Halloween costume on YouTube where I used two iPads and a FaceTime chat to blow a hole in my body,' he said.

'It went viral and led me to create the company Digital Dudz. The company has done pretty well and six months ago I actually quit my job at Nasa.

'Nasa was awesome, it is such a great atmosphere. Everyone is so bright and engaged in working together to accomplish really difficult and really cool tasks.

'But at the core, I'm still building really cool stuff that people have never seen before,' he added.

Mr Rober said he has had a really good reaction to the new jumper designs, including over 25,000 views of the YouTube video showcasing the designs, which he released on Monday.

He said: 'My favourite is the creepy Santa one - I really like it. It's the creepy factor is subtle until you really look at it.

'Nothing is as cool as building spaceships but there is something satisfying with getting an email from a customer that says "I've never given as many high fives as I did last night wearing your shirt."'

Sales of Christmas jumpers have soared 200 per cent at George at Asda, which is selling Mr Rober's jumpers.

The retailer said £3 million worth of Christmas jumpers have been sold this week alone and 82 per cent of customers revealed they would be wearing one on Christmas day.

Around 42 per cent of people said they plan on buying festive knits as gifts this year.

Jonathan Tillery, Buying Director for Menswear and Childrenswear at George said: 'Christmas jumpers are the onesie of 2013.'
