Manchester City full back Bacary Sagna has warned Chelsea that the title race is not over yet.

Speaking on the club's mid-season trip to Abu Dhabi he pointed to last year, when Manuel Pellegrini's side came from seven points behind Liverpool to finish top, as proof that they can turn things around.

Sagna, signed on a free transfer from Arsenal in the summer, was on the bench on Sunday when his old club stunned the Etihad Stadium with a deserved 2-0 win.

That shock result left City five points behind a seemingly relentless Chelsea, with 16 matches to play.

But the 31-year-old, who has struggled to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta since his move north, believes it is not over.

'Unfortunately we lost against Arsenal but we have a long way to go,' Sagna told CityTV.

'We have to work hard even more. We managed to come back last year with seven points, today we are five points behind.'

City take on Jose Mourinho's men at Stamford Bridge in a match Pellegrini now believes is 'very important'. And Sagna agrees.

'We will play a vital game against them,' he said.

The club are in the Abu Dhabi homeland of their owner and will take on Hamburg in a friendly before returning home to face Middlesbrough in the FA Cup this weekend.

'Everyone loves us here,' said Sagna. 'The chairman is from Abu Dhabi so we need to show some love to the people.'

City jetted out to the desert on Sunday hoping for some warm weather but did not find everything as they expected when they landed in a heavy downpour.

James Milner joked: 'We flew for seven hours and thought we had landed back in Manchester.'
