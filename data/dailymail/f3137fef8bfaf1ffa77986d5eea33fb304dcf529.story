A Dutch teen at the centre of an airline bomb hoax scare has been arrested in Rotterdam.

Twitter user @QueenDemetriax, who calls herself Sarah on the website, sent an apparently threatening tweet to American Airlines on Sunday morning and within minutes received a reply from the airline saying her IP address had been forwarded to the FBI.

Dutch police have today confirmed they have arrested a 14-year-old over the incident, which saw the girl inundated with angry messages.

Rotterdam Police tweeted: 'Dutch girl (14) from Rotterdam arrested after American Airlines threat. Investigation continues. #Rotterdam #Police #Force @americanair'

Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat

Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, told MailOnline officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world.

But before detectives could track the girl down, she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member.

Speaking this afternoon, Mr Ekkers said: 'Police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and, after some deliberation, we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested.

'She is now being interviewed by specially-trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders.'

Mr Ekkers said the girl has not been charged with any offence, but could face charges related to 'making false threats'.

He confirmed authorities in the Netherlands were in touch with law enforcers in the US over the incident, but insisted the investigation was launched by Dutch police alone.

The arrest comes after 'Sarah', the name used by the girl on Twitter, tweeted on Sunday: ‘Hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.’

It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply

Massive following: Her followers shot up over 30,000 by Sunday night

The airline quickly replied: ‘Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.’

The girl then pleaded with the airline, saying she’s only 14-years-old and from the Netherlands, that she’s never been to Afghanistan.

‘What do you want from me?’ She pleaded. But it was to no avail, the airline did not reply.

‘I’m so sorry I’m scared now.’ she wrote. ‘I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine.’

Infamy: The girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous, but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame

Humility: The girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one

Problem solved: Tweet deleted and FBI 'blocked'

The airline did not reply, but Twitter users did. Her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by Sunday night.

She took note of the gain in followers.

‘I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous,’ she tweeted.

Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made.
