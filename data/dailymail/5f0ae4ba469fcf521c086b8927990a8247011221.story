Michael Sam has joined the Dallas Cowboys and the star told MailOnline: ‘I’m excited to be a Cowboy, it’s great to be heading home.’

The defensive end - the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL – jetted in to Texas Tuesday night ahead of a physical today.

Sam joins the Cowboys practice squad just days after being sensationally dropped by the St Louis Rams.

The Cowboys - nicknamed America's Team - said he will compete for a spot as a defensive end on the team. Sam joined the squad for practice this afternoon, under the watchful eye of head coach Jason Garrett.

In a press conference today, Garrett said: 'We feel like he has a chance to come in at a position we’ve tried to address really throughout the offseason, throughout training camp, and compete for a spot... We just want to give him a chance to come in and see if he can help our football team.'

When the Rams announced their final pick for the 2014 season, Sam’s name wasn't on the roster, despite having an impressive pre-season.

And his shock departure sparked claims the gay star was dropped due to the unwanted attention surrounding his sexuality.

But today, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, upbeat Sam shrugged off any controversy.

He said: ‘None of that matters, I’m excited to be to be joining Dallas, I just want to play football, it's great to be heading back to my home state.

'It's been a roller coaster this past week but I'm happy where I'm at now.

‘I'm just looking forward to being a Cowboy, my focus is on making the team.’

Initially there were fears that no team in the NFL would pick Sam up but the 24-year-old’s dreams are back on track.

The laid back star said he hasn't even had the chance to speak with his family in Texas about the dream move.

‘It has all happened so quickly, but it's exciting, I just wanna get back to playing football you know.

'I haven't had chance to speak to any of my family yet, not even my mom, but I will.

'I never followed the Cowboys growing up because I never had a team. I am a fan of defenses and Dallas need some help, that's why I'm going.'

The former Missouri College star said he’s now come full-circle.

Sam, who one day dreams of earning the big bucks many NFL superstars enjoy, had to settle for economy class on this trip.

It's been a rough road for Sam. After being dropped by the Rams Sam posted an upbeat message to his Twitter account on Saturday despite his obstacles.

'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues.'

His boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of Missouri, where they both attended college.

Sam had garnered a lot of media attention (pictured on July 29 at a Rams training camp) after he became the first openly gay player to be drafted

Sam’s shock departure from the Rams had had some people inside the sport questioning if his sexual orientation was simply too much of a distraction.

Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Eric Wood said the media was too blame for focusing on the personal life of the NFL's first openly gay draft pick.

'Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted on Tuesday. 'No one wants the distraction.'

Wood's comment came after sports commentator Ross Tucker had publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a practice squad?'
