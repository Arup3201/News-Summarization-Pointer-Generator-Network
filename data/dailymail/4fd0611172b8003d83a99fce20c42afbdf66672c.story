A furious Italian son has uploaded footage of his mother being violently mugged by two thugs and offered a 2,000 Euro reward for information.

The shocking footage became an overnight sensation after it was posted on YouTube, and attracted more than 30,000 hits within 24 hours before being picked up by Italian news sites and broadcast on TV.

In the dramatic scenes a woman is seen walking down a quiet street when a black car pulls up behind her. One yob jumps out and tries to grab her handbag, before being joined by an accomplice who makes a cowardly attempt to kick and slap her before jumping back into the passenger seat.

The woman eventually loses the struggle but does not give up and starts to kick and punch the car, frantically grabbing at the open windscreen before it drives off, leaving her distressed and upset in the street.

The film was shot on a CCTV camera in a sidestreet of Frattamaggiore, a suburb of the crime-ridden southern Italian port city of Naples. It was posted by Giuseppe Munciguerra after he was sent it by his father - who went to help his wife when she called and told him of her ordeal.

In the text below the film which he uploaded on You Tube, Giuseppe wrote: 'Here's a robbery that took place on 28 February 2012, in Frattamaggiore, Naples.

'If you know one of these two robbers (two idiots) please let me know so that I can teach them how to punch someone. That woman is my mother and it really angered me to see how they lashed out at a defenceless person.

'They actually risked getting a good thumping from her. How embarrassing. If anyone can give me the names of the two people there is 2,000 Euro in it. Thanks.'

Hundreds of people posted comments on YouTube about the footage, with many praising Giuseppe for his actions while others suggested he should leave it to the police to track down the culprits.

One comment posted by a user called 'Purpietello' said: 'Forget about the 2,000 Euro, when you find out who they are let me know and I will come and give you a hand,' while another said: 'I hope you catch them before the police.'

Giuseppe said: 'I live out of town but my dad sent me the footage after the owner of the shop let him have it. My mother has reported the incident to the police but I wanted to do something because I was just so shocked when I saw the film.

'I hope someone can identify them. It's just another embarrassment for the city of Naples, but that woman is my mother and I didn't like seeing her treated that way. I've posted it on Facebook as well and I just hope someone recognises them and contacts me.

'Sadly this sort of thing happens all the time in Naples but we should not let these people win - we should stand up and take action against them.'

A police spokesman in Frattamaggiore said: 'We are aware of the incident and are investigating. We would advise against any sort of vigilante action but if anyone has any information they should contact us.'

Street muggings are common in the Naples area, and many of the culprits are drug addicts looking for a quick fix. The region is in the control of the ruthless local Mafia, who are known as the Camorra.
