A picture was released by detectives today of a man suspected of trying to abduct a three-year-old British girl in the Canary Islands.

A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise in Lanzarote when a man - believed to be British - attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop.

The victim's father noticed she was missing, left a store and spotted the youngster being led around a corner into an alleyway by a man, who was holding her by the hand.

He shouted out and ran up to his daughter, pulling her away from the man who then left the scene.

The incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann, who went missing from her apartment in Portugal in 2007 and has never been seen since.

The family were on the beach a short time later and saw the same man, who spoke fluent English, sitting between some rocks and acting suspiciously.

The victim's father confronted the suspect, but he left the scene before police arrived.

But the quick-thinking family took photos of the man, which have been released by police today, in an attempt to identify him.

The suspect is described as white, with pasty skin, of stocky build with broad shoulders, 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins, 40 to 55 years old, with short dark hair and a dark moustache.

The incident happened on January
30 last year, but Thames Valley Police spokesman said the delay in
issuing the pictures was due to Spanish police having to exhaust their 
investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to Britain.

Investigating officer Detective Constable John Swallow: 'This is a very concerning incident in which a young girl was led away from her family by an unknown man.

'The victim's father knew it was his daughter being led around the corner because he recognised her flashing trainers.

'The incident was reported to Thames Valley Police after initially being reported to police in Lanzarote and we have been making enquiries to try and establish the man's identity since then.

'We are working closely with the Spanish authorities and Interpol on this case and will continue to do so.

'We have reason to believe he may be a British citizen as he spoke fluent English and made references to being on holiday.

'I am appealing for anyone who recognises the man in the images or has information on his whereabouts to contact police as soon as possible.'

A near six-year search for Madeleine has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luiz on May 3, 2007.

There have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years, but nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead.

In the latest development last month, detectives believe a team of British cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts.

Owners of apartments in the Portuguese holiday complex where Maddie and her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were staying when she vanished have been asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van.

One property owner said police told him they are looking for a group of six to eight British cleaners who drove around the Praia da Luz area in a white van, working in holiday apartments.

Operation Grange was set up by the 
Metropolitan Police two years ago at the request of Prime Minister David
Cameron following a plea by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, of 
Rothley, Leicestershire.
