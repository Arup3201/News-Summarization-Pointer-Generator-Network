Louis van Gaal be warned: the Manchester derby is madder than ever.

The Dutch boss will enjoy (or perhaps he won't) his first clash with United's city rivals on Sunday.

Manuel Pellegrini's out-of-form champions are the hosts, but Van Gaal's boys have hardly been at their best of late either. 

Manchester City host Manchester United on Sunday - the Citizens won both League matches last season 

Nerves will be frayed and tensions high and it certainly promises to be another cracker.

And that, you have to say, would be in keeping with the nutty narrative of this fixture in recent seasons.

Here, Sportsmail explains why the Madchester derby has become the best of them all…

Late shows…

If this fixture has proved anything in recent years it is that supporters shouldn't leave their seat until they are sure the contest is over. The 'Michael Owen derby' is a prime example. The former England striker didn't have too many highlights in a United shirt but his last-gasp winner in 2009 was undoubtedly the pick. Craig Bellamy had only just made it 3-3 to seemingly ensure a share of the spoils for City but there was yet another twist in the tale, Owen climaxing a pulsating affair with a predatory prod deep in to injury-time.

Heels overhead…

If Owen's goal was dramatic in its timing, then Wayne Rooney's two years later was even more so in its stunning, jaw-dropping execution. It was during the February 2011 derby at Old Trafford that, with the score at 1-1 and 12 minutes remaining, the United forward vacated the turf to connect with Nani's centre and send the most audacious overhead kick beyond Joe Hart to win it for the hosts. Even Sir Alex Ferguson was stunned and Rooney's goal was deservedly later crowned the best of that season.

Why Always Him?

Mario Balotelli had been criticised for setting off a firework in his bathroom in the week leading up to the derby in October 2011. But that was nothing compared with the explosion of blue which awaited United at Old Trafford. Typically, it was Balotelli who opened the scoring - revealing the now infamous T-shirt 'Why Always Me?' - and City went on to humiliate their rivals, inflicting a 6-1 drubbing with Balotelli adding the second. The noisy neighbours were certainly making a racket that day.

Blood and thunder…

As if Robin van Persie sealing United's last-minute triumph with a free-kick to edge a five-goal thriller in 2012 wasn't enough, the real story of the day broke during the aftermath of that strike. As United's players celebrated in front of the away fans, a coin struck Rio Ferdinand, leaving him with blood pouring from a wound above his eye. A City fan then tried to get to Ferdinand, only for City goalkeeper Joe Hart to intervene. It was a raucous end to a typically feisty affair.

United have lost the last three derbies and were well beaten 3-0 and 4-1 in last season's matches 

Moyes is mauled

Part One

In his first Manchester derby, David Moyes saw his sorry side smashed 4-1 at the Etihad. The hosts ran riot over a shambolic United and were four goals up just five minutes in to the second half before taking their foot off the gas. 

It was a sign of things to come for the beleaguered boss.

Part Two

The end was nigh for Moyes when City ventured to Old Trafford in March of last season. The visitors were ahead inside the first minute thanks to Edin Dzeko and the Bosnian added another after the break before Yaya Toure compounded Moyes' misery in stoppage-time. The Scot was gone within a month.

… Louis van Gaal – you have been warned!
