Robots which can open doors and operate lifts without any help from humans are being used to deliver food to almost 1,000 patients around a new £430m hospital.

Southmead Hospital in Bristol has brought in a the fleet of Automatic Guided Vehicles to pick up food and deliver them to patients.

The droids, which start work every day at 10.15am, are even able to do the preparation work, by transferring chilled dishes to kitchens and heating up the food.

These robots are being used to deliver food to almost 1,000 patients at Southmead Hospital, Bristol 

The hospital has deployed a fleet of Automatic Guided Vehicles which start work at 10.15am each day to deliver meals to patients. This is the robots having picking up the food, ready to take to the wards

After completing their rounds, the 1ft tall machines return to their charging stations until they need to be used again for dinner.

Catering manager Gary Wilkins said it was as simple as pressing a button and the machines did the rest. 

He said: 'They (the robots) are very slick and very quick. At first you are a bit worried about whether it is all going to work, but they are amazing.'

The AGVs are also used to transport waste, linen, supplies, sterile instruments, endoscopes and pharmacy items around the building.

The machines operate in designated areas, which are primarily staff only, and have safety features including the ability to stop if something gets in the way.

They are able to navigate their way along 'virtual tracks' using infra-red laser scanners and comparing what they sense with an in-built map.

The machines served the heated-up prepared meals to patients at the hospital 

It is hoped that the machines will soon be introduced in other parts of the hospital.

The newly-built Southmead Hospital was recently criticised for its food, after one patient took pictures of poor portions.

But Sharon Fortune, head of facilities for hospitality, defended the food available to patients.

She said: 'We never run out of food on the wards, people can always ask for extra. It is up to the staff on the ward to judge it.

'We don't know if it is a frail old man we are serving or a large rugby player so it's up to each ward to know their patient's and serve food accordingly.'

There has been growing pressure on hospitals around the UK to improve their menus. 

Last week, MailOnline published a series of photos of patients' sub-standard meals at hospitals around the country.

The campaign was backed by TV chef James Martin, a hospital food standards campaigner. 

Doctors are also expressing concerns about the food served to hospital patients. 

The Government now says it is going to take action to help ensure that all hospitals serve good-quality food.

Last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that, for the first time, there would be 'mandatory food standards' enforced through legally-binding NHS contracts. Hospitals that don't provide good enough food could be fined.

Food will be rated on criteria such as quality and choice of meals and published in a league table on the NHS Choices website.

It's not the first time a government has tried to improve hospital food. Since 1992, £54 million has been 'wasted' on 21 initiatives to try to raise standards, according to the Campaign for Better Hospital Food.
