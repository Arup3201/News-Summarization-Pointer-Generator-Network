French authorities are investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video titled Blow Up France 2 may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist- a source has claimed.

The footage, released by French-speaking ISIS fighters on Tuesday, shows masked jihadists praising the attacks on Paris last month and calling on Muslims to carry out further terror attacks in France.

In a chilling statement to camera, the terrorist says: 'Don’t give up and particularly don’t lower your weapons, don’t surrender, kill. Today it’s our darwa, kill them, you now have more than 4 million targets.'

French authorities are said to be investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video (pictured in camouflage headgear) may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist

A source close to the French investigation into the kosher deli attacks, told CNN that authorities think the woman   in the video, seen wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon, could be Hayat Boumeddiene.

Boumeddiene is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who killed four hostages at the kosher Hyper Cacher market in the eastern part of the French capital on January 9.

He was killed by police following an hours-long standoff.  

Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is also believed to have been a co-conspirator in attack. She is currently thought to be in Syria.

She and Coulibaly were married in a religious ceremony, but the marriage was not officially recognized under French law.

The kosher supermarket attack followed the January 8 massacre by Islamic gunmen at Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine.

Gunmen brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12 people at the  magazine's offices in Paris. The next day, a French police officer was killed. 

Seventeen people were killed over those three days.

The massacre caused a worldwide outcry and calls for the defense of free speech after ISIS claimed the cartoonists were murdered because they published pictures of the prophet Mohammed.

But in the new ISIS video, the militants claimed:

'Where is this freedom of speech? When in 2009, the cartoonist Siné, after drawing the Jews and Sarkozy’s son, was sacked by Charb and Charlie Hebdo.'

The video also calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France.

The jihadist calls on French Muslims to: ''Kill a cop with a knife, take his gun, with his gun kill a soldier, with his shotgun throw yourself in the way of your God.'

They go on to warn the West that they cannot expect peace from the Islamist terrorists.

'If you fight for democracy, we will fight for Islam,' they said. 'You will have to accept that we will react fully to the numerous crimes you committed. You took our rights. Therefore you can't expect to be in peace.'

The extremist organization that has carved out a de facto jihadist state across large swaths of Syria and Iraq. 

In the Blow Up France 2 video they go onto urge French Muslims to defect from the Fifth Republic and take up arms in the new 'caliphate.'
