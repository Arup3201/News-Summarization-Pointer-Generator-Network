No wonder they are smiling. On the sunny seafront at Folkestone, two African migrants look forward to a new life after a hazardous journey across the English Channel hidden in a refrigerated lorry and almost suffocating to death.

Now, eight days after arriving, they live at the taxpayers’ expense in a Kent holiday hotel with a swimming pool and champagne on offer while Home Office officials search for UK homes for them.

‘We are so happy and our only worry is whether we will need coats for the cold weather in your winter,’ says Abrham Embaye, 30, in his good English as he puts his arm round his friend, Abel Teages, aged 20.

‘We are going to make our lives in your country and never go back to Africa. The Home Office officials say we will stay in this hotel, where we get three meals a day and nice rooms, until October 6 and then I go to Leeds and Abel is to live in Cardiff. Is Leeds colder than Cardiff?’

He produces a bunch of official papers in a brown envelope with a Home Office stamp on the top to show me he is telling the truth.

The two migrants were among a group of 24 Eritrean men and women who paid £400 each to trafficking agents for the final leg of their journey to the UK – a place in a refrigerated lorry which arrived in Dover on a ferry from Calais, eight days ago.

They were discovered after seven hours in the truck when the foreign driver parked near Dover. The migrants, frightened of being suffocated, had begun banging on the sides of the lorry. A mechanic from a nearby workshop broke the security seal to the vehicle and found them gasping for breath.

The incident, filmed on mobile phones, made national headlines. It also raised questions over how hundreds of migrants from impoverished African and beleaguered Middle East countries still slip over the 22 miles of water from Calais each month despite Home Office promises that UK border controls at the French port have been tightened up.

This week, as 1,500 migrants waited in Calais to try their chance of smuggling themselves to the UK, the Government pledged £4million a year until 2017 to counter organised trafficking gangs. Crucially, new technology at the port to look inside refrigerated lorries – the vehicles where migrants appear to routinely escape detection – is expected to be introduced too.

Around 130 migrants moved there by coach on Tuesday from the overcrowded Euro Queens’ hotel near Croydon, which was dubbed Hotel Asylum by locals and guests when they found 500 asylum seekers squashed into 98 rooms last weekend. Now the Grand Burstin is being called Hotel Asylum 2.

It will cost taxpayers £72,000 to keep the migrants from Croydon there for two weeks in £40-a-night rooms.

As Folkestone councillor Bob Neaves said: ‘A lot of residents and business people are disgusted the migrants have been sprung on us. They’re worried about tourism.

‘We don’t want this to become another Calais.’

Kath Mahon, a 52-year-old from Preston, who was last week enjoying a holiday at the Grand Burstin with her daughter Heather, 27, said: ‘It makes us feel uncomfortable. We don’t know who they are and whether they have criminal records. There’s old people staying here who are petrified.’

Another holidaymaker, a TripAdvisor user, Nicola from Worcester, left a review on Thursday of the experience at the hotel after being surprised to meet migrants there.

She wrote: ‘We booked the weekend for our wedding anniversary, but as soon as we checked in we could see it was a lovely hotel, so we booked an extra night. However on the evening of our extra night, 130 asylum seekers arrived.

‘It worried the life out of me, with all that’s going on we didn’t know if we were in any danger.

‘We didn’t sleep, we went back to our room early as we were worried about our belongings and even worried about our car.

‘If my husband hadn’t had two glasses of wine with dinner we would [have] left that evening.’

However – oblivious to the hostility – the migrants, mainly from Eritrea but also from the Middle East troublespots, are delighted with their new abode.

Both Abrham and Abel were housed temporarily at other hotels near Dover after being rescued from the lorry. They were then sent to Folkestone earlier this week to join the 130 from Croydon at the Grand Burstin.

The migrants I met are claiming asylum and will be given free housing plus cash benefits of £150 a month while the Home Office decides if they can stay in the UK, a process which could take years.

The Romanian driver of the refrigerated lorry carrying the Eritrean group, which included nine children, has been charged with assisting the entry of illegals and is due in court next week.

The Eritreans are Christians who flee a dictatorship where every male over 18 is forced to serve in the Army – although Abrham claims he was forced into service at the age of 13.

They start their journey to the West by paying trafficking agents to guide them in lorry convoys over the Sahara desert to Libya and, from there, by boat to Italy.

A trickle of Eritreans smuggling themselves to the UK is now a torrent. Their asylum claims are often granted because of the oppression in their country. As I sit with Abrham on a harbour bench outside the Great Burstin, he explains: ‘I was made to serve in the Eritrean Army from when I was a young teenager. It is a frightening country and so we want to get to England.

‘My family paid £1,200 to a trafficking agent put me on a lorry across the Sahara to the Libyan seaport of Zwara. Then they paid £1,400 to another agent for my place on a small boat to the Italian coastline.

‘I made my way to Rome and stayed with a group of Eritreans there to rest. I then took a train through the Italian-French border to Nice in the south of France, before getting others to Paris and Calais.

‘I was in Calais for seven weeks trying to get on a lorry day and night. I hid my Christian cross under my T-shirt because I was afraid I would be attacked by the Muslim migrants there.’

He continued as the voice of Vera Lynn’s White Cliffs of Dover rang out from a nearby cafe: ‘A week ago I got my chance. My family paid more money to an agent for my place on the refrigerated lorry.’

The migrants say they were around seven hours inside the lorry before the doors opened and they could breathe properly again.

‘We were desperate, gasping for air,’ says Abrham.

Then he gives another broad grin before adding: ‘But, at last I was in England.’
