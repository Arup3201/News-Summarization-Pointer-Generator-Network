Karen Danczuk, the wife of Labour MP Simon, has revealed that Ed Miliband 'didn't know where to look' as he tried to avoid glancing at her cleavage when they squeezed into a lift.

Mrs Danczuk – who has become well-known for posting revealing selfies on Twitter - said the Labour leader went red with embarrassment because she wore a low-cut top.

The Labour supporting mother-of-two, 31, also questioned Mr Milband's leadership credentials saying he is out of touch with working class voters and praised Ukip's stance on immigration.

Stuck in a lift: Karen Danczuk, the wife of Labour MP Simon, has described the moment Ed Miliband 'didn't know where to look' when she wore a low-cut top

'For some reason Ed and I kept bumping into each other in the lift. It must have been a dozen times,' she told The Sun. 

'The first few times I was dressed in a suit. But finally I was dressed up for the evening and was wearing a low-cut top. It was really awkward.

'We all try not to stare in those situations and Ed was no different. We were in a very small space together and he didn't know where to look.'

The 31-year-old Labour supporter says the party's leader is failing to connect with working class voters because he does not 'speak their language'.

She said:'If Ed Miliband says, "We need to cut the deficit," what does that mean to people on a council estate? 

'We need to be screaming about immigration. The NHS is important but you knock on doors and immigration is bigger. Ukip are doing well because they scream about immigration'. 

She added: 'God forbid the working class party should actually have someone working class to represent us'.

Mrs Danczuk also said Mr Miliband keeps refusing to visit Rochdale, represented by her husband Simon, to avoid a Gillian Duffy moment, which wrecked the 2010 election campaign for Labour.

Mrs Duffy’s notorious encounter with Gordon Brown damaged Labour’s election hopes  after he was caught on a microphone calling her a ‘bigoted woman’ for raising concerns about immigration.

Mrs Danczuk said: 'I keep inviting Ed to Rochdale. He won't because of Gillian Duffy. His people think, 'Oh my God, it's Rochdale'. But he should do it'.

Disaster: Gordon Brown's election hopes in 2010 were sunk when he called Gillian Duffy a bigot in Rochdale. Mrs Danczuk says Ed Miliband is refusing to return to the town

Yesterday she revealed she was repeatedly raped from the age of six by a family friend and has now gone to police.  

The mother of two said years of abuse brought on suicidal feelings, and prompted her to wear black from ‘head to toe’ to avoid attention.

The 31-year-old spent 20 years on anti-depressants for two decades, self-harming and attempting suicide in 2007.

But she said her famous selfies have helped win back her confidence and said she took up the habit because she can now ‘have fun without being ashamed of myself’.

She described how she met her local MP Simon Danczuk - 16 years older than her -  who 'is the only man I've truly loved. He has made me so happy. He made me feel wanted'.

She told The Sun's Jane Atkinson and Craig Woodhouse her abuser was a family friend who first preyed on her when she was only six years old.

‘He was just someone who would be around a lot. I didn’t take much notice of him until one night he came up to my bedroom. 

'He didn’t chat. He just came to my bed, got hold of my hand and made me put it on [him]. 

'He tried to make it a game. I was young, but I knew right from wrong. It was wrong.’

She said the man abused her repeatedly.  

‘I never said a word. Tears would roll down my face but I tried not to acknowledge what was happening,' she said.

'I’d try to blank it out. I had a very unhappy childhood. I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.’

She said that after her abuse she felt ‘worthless’ and ‘guilty, as though I had somehow brought this on myself ... but I was just a little girl’. 

Mrs Danczuk, 31, a Labour councillor, is married to Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk, 47 (together above)

The mother - who describes herself online as the Queen of the Selfie - said years of abuse brought on suicidal feelings, and prompted her to wear black from ‘head to toe’ to avoid attention. She said she now feels 'free'

She continued: ‘I was on anti-depressants for years and wanted to kill myself. I used to cover my body, wear head-to-toe black clothes so I didn’t draw attention to myself, I was so self-conscious. I now know I didn’t do anything wrong. Finally I realised it isn’t my fault.

‘I can have fun without being ashamed of myself. And that is why I take pictures and put them on Twitter – because I can. I’m now free to do whatever I want.’

Mrs Danczuk – who describes herself online as the Queen of the Selfie – announced last month that she will stand down as a Labour councillor for Kingsway, Rochdale at the next election to pursue other opportunities. 

She is believed to be interested in working in television, and has alreay hired a London-based PR agency.

Her husband, MP for Rochdale since 2010, has been a vociferous campaigner against child abuse and those who cover up such crimes.
