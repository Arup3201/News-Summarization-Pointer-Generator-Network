Roald Dahl has been voted as the favourite author of parents and children in a survey to mark International Children's Book Day

Roald Dahl has beaten Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling to be named best children’s author of all time by parents and their children.

The much-loved writer remains a firm favourite of children today, more than 50 years since the publication of James and The Giant Peach - Dahl’s first major children’s book.

Parents and children were asked to list their top three children’s authors and top three characters for a survey to mark International Children’s Book Day today.

Children listed Dahl first, followed by J.K. Rowling and Beatrix Potter.

Their parents also picked Dahl as first choice, with Enid Blyton second and Rowling third.

Harry Potter was named by both parents and children as their favourite book character.

The
 Gruffalo and The Cat in the Hat were second and third choice for 
children, while their parents picked Blyton’s Famous Five and Dahl’s 
BFG.

Mother Joanna Spencer, 
39, from London, said her five-year-old daughter Jessica enjoyed her 
favourite Dahl books as much as she had as a child.

She added: ‘My daughter loves reading the BFG, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

‘She likes Harry Potter, but he doesn’t come close to books by Roald Dahl.

‘He was my childhood favourite and he’s now my daughter’s favourite as well.’

Nearly a third of parents said their 
children owned an e-reader and 12 per cent said their children did not 
read paper books, according to the survey by book retailer The Works.

Kevin
 Keaney, the chief executive of The Works, said: ‘It’s great to see 
classic children’s books and characters are still holding favour with 
kids throughout Britain, with parents’ own preferences presumably 
swaying their little ones’ reading habits.

Parents and children alike named Rowling's Harry Potter as their favourite book character while children plumped for The Gruffalo as their second favourite.

‘More than half of the parents polled said their children read the same books as they did, showing tastes haven’t changed and classics remain popular.’

Dahl, who died aged 74 in 1990, wrote around 40 novels, short story collections and poetry books for children and adults.

His most loved children’s books include Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The Witches and Fantastic Mr Fox. Many of his books have been made into feature films or television adaptions.

He also wrote several film and television scripts, including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and the Bond film You Only Live Twice, as well as the popular 1980s television series Tales of the Unexpected.

International Children’s Book Day has been held on or around April 2 - the birthday of Hans Christian Anderson - every year since 1967. It aims to inspire children to love reading.
