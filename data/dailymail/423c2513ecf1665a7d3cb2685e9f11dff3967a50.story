An 84-year-old man has fallen to his death after falling from a shopping centre car park in front of horrified shop assistants.

Workers at the Kingsmead Shopping Centre in Farnborough, Hampshire, witnessed the pensioner fall from the top floor of the car park at 8.20am today.

Eyewitnesses dialled 999 and police and paramedics raced to the scene, but were unable to help the OAP.
