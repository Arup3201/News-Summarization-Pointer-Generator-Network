Probe: The man who handed himself in to authorities in Cyprus has facial similarities with reconstructions of how Ben may now look, the family said

This young man could be missing Briton Ben Needham, Greek authorities have revealed.

Ben was just two went he went missing from his family while they where holidaying in Kos, in 1991.

But after 22 years, police have called for DNA tests on the member of a Roma family living in Cyprus who they claim could be the long-lost child.

Police have even handed Ben's mother Kerry an image of the tall, blue-eyed man they are testing, with light brown hair, wearing a blue and white striped rugby top.

There is also a video of the 22-year-old man, which has been viewed by authorities.

The
 man came to the attention of the Greek police when he fled the mainland
 with his family a few years ago to avoid compulsory military service.

After seeing the image, Kerry, 41, told the Sunday Mirror that she believes the man in the photograph could be Ben, who would now be aged 23.

She said: 'I’ve seen the picture and believe he bears a resemblance to how Ben might now look.

'As a family we’re greatly 
lifted by this and we will be in close contact with the Greek 
authorities to make sure we are kept fully aware of any progress.

'We’ve never given up hope of finding Ben and we are encouraged that the police in Greece are continuing to investigate.'

The image came to light after an unnamed tipster approached the Lawyers Association in Kos.

Panayiotis Avrithis, the president the association, realised the potentially explosive nature of the images and handed them to Alexandra Moussoura, the area's District Attorney.

The video clip shows a man Greek sources say is between 20 and 25, with four other men from the Roma community, attending a church service in Limassol, Cyprus.

It was published with the photograph on Greek news site Zougla. 

The development has been described as 'highly significant' by Greek police, who are now expected to work with their Cypriot colleagues to track down the man and establish his identity.

Ben disappeared on July 24, 1991, while his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham were looking after him in the Greek resort.

Despite a move by Greek police to excavate land in Kos in a bid to uncover Ben's body, his mother Kerry has refused to believe that her son died after being taken.

Last year, officers from South Yorkshire police travelled to the island to conduct their own land search, but no major new leads emerged.

The case bears strong links to the tale of little 'Maria', the four-year-old blonde girl who was found living with Romas Greece this month, after allegedly being 'trafficked'.

It has since emerged that she is the daughter of a Bulgarian woman called Sasha Ruseva after DNA tests proved biological link.

Mrs Ruseva, 35, claimed she handed her daughter over to a Roma family after she gave birth in Greece and could not afford to register the new born.

But she and her husband Atanas, 37, could now now face prosecution after allegations that she sold Maria for profit.

Regardless of the conclusion, the evidence of Romas having acquired children who are not their own lends support to the theory that more missing children could have ended up in the impoverished communities.

Maria's story sent shockwaves all round the world with parents of missing youngsters given fresh hope by her discovery.

Gerry and Kate McCann were alerted to the case after Police in Portugal agreed to reopen their investigation into missing Maddie.

Authorities in Ireland too, seized two children from a Roma family to two test if they were living with their biological parents.

In
 both cases, police suspected that the children, a seven-year-old girl 
from Dublin and two-year-old Iancu Munteau from Athlone, might be 
victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike
 the rest of their immediate family.

Tests have since shown that both children were living with their real parents.
