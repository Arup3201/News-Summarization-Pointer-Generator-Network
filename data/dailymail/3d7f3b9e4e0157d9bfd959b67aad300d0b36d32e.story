Mario Balotelli has accepted a Football Association charge for posting an allegedly abusive or insulting image on social media.

The Liverpool striker was in breach of rule E3 [1] and had until 6pm on Monday, December 15 to submit how he will answer.

The Italy international was charged a week ago with breaching FA rule E3(1) as a result of his posting of an image of computer game character Super Mario on Instagram which included the words 'jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew'.

His offence was deemed to be an 'aggravated breach', as defined by rule E3(2), as it included a reference to ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality or religion or belief.

Having worked closely with Liverpool since he was charged, Balotelli has admitted he is in breach of the FA's social media guidelines but he will offer mitigation. The 24-year-old has not requested a personal hearing, instead he has submitted written mitigation.

When first asked for his observations by the FA after he reposted an image of the computer game character Super Mario, Balotelli submitted evidence of how he has been racially abused on social media.

The Liverpool striker insisted that he meant no offence by tweeting that his mother is Jewish

That, however, did not stopped the FA taking action.

The FA added in a statement last week: 'It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’

There is no timeline for when the issue will be closed.
