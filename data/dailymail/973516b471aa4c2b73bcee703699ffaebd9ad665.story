Roy Hodgson admits he is concerned about the 'pathways' available for young English footballers, rather than the 'production line' but wants more to be done to clear their route to international football.

As a failed World Cup campaign ends against Costa Rica on Tuesday, Hodgson has for the first time addressed the findings of the England Commission set up last autumn by FA chairman Greg Dyke with a view to producing more elite players and a better national team.

The England manager was part of the Commission but has been occupied with his preparations for the tournament in Brazil since Dyke unveiled his recommendations last month, which included the radical idea of creating a fifth division where clubs from the Barclays Premier League could play their B-teams.

The difference: Luis Suarez (centre right) sent England tumbling out of the World Cup with a brace last week

'It’s not been high on my agenda these last few weeks,' said Hodgson, but the issue will return to the agenda as the nation digests this World Cup performance, one which will go down as the worst ever if England lose to Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte.

'My concern is that we’re going to produce a lot of good players who will merit a place in the teams but will find their place blocked,' he added. 'It’s pathways that concern me more than the production line. It’s a fact of life and one that will take a long time to address, if we address it at all.

'The first thing we have to concentrate on is to get our own act right with the England teams. We have to make certain that we get as much access as we can to the players in the academies, that we induct them fully into what we’re expecting, and the academies do some very good work from 17-18, 19 Under 21 level.

'We have to make certain that when the players come into our environment that we induct them fully into what we are expecting, what we think being an England player means, not just in terms of behaviour and culture, but in terms of how important it is for you to play in a certain way, making certain we get our midfielders turning on the ball, receiving balls on the back foot, being positive. We can do some work on that. We don’t just have to rely on clubs giving their 19-year-old a game in the first-team or not. We can do that.'

Rarity: Raheem Sterling is one of just a few talented England youngsters to play for a top Premier League club

The kid's alright: Ross Barkley is another top talent who will be central to England's plans in the coming years

Central to the 'pathway' problem is the fact the Barclays Premier League contains such a large proportion of overseas players, and the trend appears set to continue, leaving an ever diminishing pool of elite talent available to the England manager.

The lack of experience at the very top has repercussions on England. Only four of those who started in the Group D defeat against Uruguay last week had played in the Champions League last season.

Although whether the B-team solution, heavily criticised when it was revealed by Dyke, will cure this problem is debateable.

'There’s always going to be a problem,' said Hodgson. 'It’s ridiculous to try to suggest there isn’t. The players we’re looking at who could be good enough to play for England at 18, 19, 20 years of age are quite often playing in the top five or six clubs. That’s where the biggest stars are, and where the biggest money is and where the biggest chance of a blockage is in getting into the team. So let’s come to terms with that.

Spot the Englishman: Manchester City won the Premier League with a cosmopolitan squad

'Let’s keep looking if there is a system that would help these 19-year-olds who are not playing in United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Man City first-teams. Is there a way of getting them into football on a regular basis to play against men that would improve them.

'It’s not as easy as all that. You run into arguments like would the best thing for Raheem Sterling not playing for Liverpool be to go and play in the English third division or the Conference? Would that be the best way forward? It’s complicated. I’m glad we’re looking into it. But my head’s a little bit full of the emotions about going home on Wednesday which I’m not looking forward to.'
