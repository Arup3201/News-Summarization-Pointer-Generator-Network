Quit: Controversial MP Louise Mensch has resigned this morning for family reasons

A Tory MP who recently admitted she took Class A drugs that 'messed with her head' has sensationally quit this morning.

Chick lit author Louise Mensch says she can no longer represent Corby in Northamptonshire because she cannot juggle her political and family lives.

Mrs Mensch, who had been touted as a future minister, will instead move to New York with her three children to live with her second husband Peter, who is manager of rock supergroup Metallica.

They secretly married in America last year.

'I am completely devastated. It’s been unbelievably difficult to manage family life,' she told the Northamptonshire Telegraph.

'We have been trying to find a way forward with the Prime Minister’s office but I just can’t spend as much time with my children as I want to.'

Mrs Mensch will announce her resignation later this morning and a by-election will take place on November 15.

It is understood she was going to quit in 2015 but couldn't carry on any longer.

She has three children, aged four, seven and eight, from her first marriage to property developer Anthony LoCicero.

'I love Corby and East Northamptonshire but my family has to come first,' she said.

'When I took the post I was in a different position but sometimes life throws you a curve ball that you didn’t expect.

'We are now going to be moving out to New York as a family.

'Every family is different and another mother might feel she can manage things.

'It’s been an honour to represent the people of Corby and East Northants and I will miss them.'

The backbencher shot to prominence as a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee which investigated the phone-hacking scandal.

And her resignation in a tight marginal seat will prove a major test for David Cameron’s Tories.

Mrs Mensch - then Louise Bagshawe before
her marriage last year - won by only 1,951 votes in the 2010 general 
election. Labour had previously held the constituency since 1997.

Her resignation sparked rumors that Boris Johnson would be jettisoned in to fight for the vacant seat.

But the Mayor of London said this 
morning: 'I'm sure Corby is a lovely town but I have a fantastic job 
running the best big city on the planet.'

In her resignation letter to the Prime Minister, the mother-of-three said: 'As you know, I have been struggling for some time to find the best outcome for my family life, and have decided, in order to keep us together, to move to New York.

Mrs Mensch told Mr Cameron that letting her to work from her constituency on Thursdays and Fridays had allowed her to spend more time with her children.

'Unfortunately, it has not proved to be enough. I am very sorry that, despite my best efforts, I have been unable to make the balancing act work for our family,' she said.

The Prime Minister replied that he was aware it had been 'a particularly difficult period for you and your family.

'With that in mind, it is with enormous regret that I accept your resignation as the Member of Parliament for Corby and East Northamptonshire, a seat that had been Labour for 13 years before you,' he said.

'I do so only because I wish to support you in acting in the best interests of your family, which must come first.'

Mr Cameron said Mrs Mensch had been an 'inspiring' MP and hinted that she had been in line for a role in the Government.

'It goes without saying that I had wished to see you serve for longer and at a more senior level,' he said.

'But you have made a tremendous contribution in the short period you have served in the House of Commons, and have much to be very proud of.'

The Tory MP managed to shock viewers of BBC's Question Time last night with an emotional 
account of how doing Class A drugs in her youth had ‘messed with her 
head’.

Mensch clashed
with punk star Johnny Rotten – real name John Lydon – on the topic of the 
legalisation of drugs, appearing close to tears as she claimed her 
experiences had left her with ‘long-term mental health effects’.

Mrs Mensch, 41, refused to reveal what she had taken, as she said she did not want to ‘glorify’ the use of any particular drug.

‘It’s something that I regret incredibly in my youth, that I messed with my brain. I have said we all do stupid things when we are young. It’s had long-term mental health effects on me,' she said.

‘It’s caused me to be more anxious than I need to be... I did serious drugs and it messed with my head and it’s a terrible thing.’

Mrs Mensch, whose novels are published under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, had previously admitted she took drugs in her 20s, when she worked in the music industry.

Last year, when confronted over claims she had taken drugs with classical violinist Nigel Kennedy in a Birmingham nightclub several years ago, she said it was ‘highly probable’.
