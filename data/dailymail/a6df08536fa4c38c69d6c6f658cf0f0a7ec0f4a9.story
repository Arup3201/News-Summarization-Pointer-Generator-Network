A Texas teenager whose date died in their hotel room after her senior prom has sent a series of emotional text messages to a friend suggesting she passed away following an overdose.

The unidentified date frantically called 911 on Saturday morning after waking up in a North Houston Hyatt to find that 17-year-old Jacqueline Gomez was not breathing.

Investigators said that the MacArthur High School senior showed no outward signs of injury and the results of her autopsy are pending. They added that her boyfriend is not suspected of any crime.

Now text messages that he sent to one of Gomez's friends on Saturday afternoon have indicated that investigators believe she might have overdosed, the Houston Chronicle reported.

The friend, Justice Gonzalez, shared the messages with the Chronicle. She said she texted the date, who is not a student, after she saw pictures he had posted to Instagram showing him crying.

'They said she overdosed,' a text reads, likely referring to law enforcement. 'I woke up. I tried waking her but she wouldn't. I was screaming and crying telling her to wake up. But she didn't. She didn't.'

He added that she had seemed 'perfectly fine and happy' when they left the prom and went to bed.

He told authorities that they had consumed some alcohol before bed, and he added in the text messages that she had also taken the prescription painkiller hydrocodone.

He said he did not know where they were from or how many she had taken.

'I shoulda took them away and flushed em,' he added. 'I miss my girl.'

Friends and family previously denied Gomez was a hard-partying teenager, and said she spent her time working at a Kroger grocery and finishing up her high school studies.

The couple had booked into Houston's Hyatt Hotel, where other students were also staying, at about 11pm on Friday following the 'Miami Night' prom.

The next morning, the boyfriend called 911 to report that she was not breathing.

According to KHOU 11, police found alcohol and prescription painkillers in the hotel room.

Her boyfriend was taken in for questioning, but only so detectives could try to understand what had happened. Police said he is not a suspect.

'He was there. He knows everything, so we're just continually wanting to find out what happened,' Detective Mike Miller said.

The unexpected death has shocked 
Jacqueline's classmates at Aldine ISD MacArthur High School, who only 
hours earlier had attended the prom with her.

'It's shocking. I can't believe it. I 
mean, really, I can't believe it,' Leandra 
Mendez, a 19-year-old classmate of Jacqueline's, told the Houston Chronicle.

In the weeks leading up to the prom, which was held in the same hotel where Jacqueline's body was found, the teenager had been planning her dress with friends.

Briana Hernandez, who worked at a store with Jacqueline, said prom was all the teenager had talked about for the past few weeks.Â 

'Every day she would come to work and talk about it. She was so excited to go to prom,' Miss Hernandez told Click2Houston.

She added that Jacqueline, 'who always came to work with a smile' had sent a picture of her in the hotel room just hours before she died.

'I told her right before left ... "Just please be safe, Jackie". And I gave her a hug, and
 she left,' friend Justice Gonzalez said.

Jacqueline had been due to attend Lone Star College, where she planned to study to become a pharmacy technician.
