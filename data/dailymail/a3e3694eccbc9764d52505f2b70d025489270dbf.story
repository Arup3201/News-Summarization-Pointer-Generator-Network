Hull City have released details of their new home kit for a historic 2014-15 season that will see them compete in the Europa League after reaching the FA Cup final last season.

The Tigers' amber and black stripes remain unchanged, featuring a logo of new sponsors 12BET as modelled by stars Jake Livermore, Tom Huddlestone and goalkeeper Allan McGregor.

Hull City manager Steve Bruce commented: 'Umbro have always had a reputation for quality and I’m very familiar with the brand from my own playing days.

Groundbreaking: Hull qualified for Europe by reaching the FA Cup final, before eventually losing to Arsenal

Hull managed to 
attract the largest commercial deal in their 110-year history after 
bookmakers 12Bet agreed a two-year contract as shirt sponsors.

The
 seven-figure deal represents a 60 per cent increase on their previous 
deal with Cash Converters, a reward for last season’s impressive return 
to the Barclays Premier League and FA Cup final run.

It
 also represents the first major overseas investment since owner Assem 
Allam saw his plans to change the the club’s name from Hull City to Hull
 Tigers quashed by a Football Association panel.
