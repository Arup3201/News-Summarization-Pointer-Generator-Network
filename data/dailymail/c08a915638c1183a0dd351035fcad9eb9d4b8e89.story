As many as 15,000 fraudulent votes helped Lutfur Rahman win re-election in Tower Hamlets last year, it was claimed in court today.

The independent mayor of the east London borough faces allegations of 'electoral fraud' at the High Court, where his accusers today claimed forgery and bullying helped him at the polls.

Local activist Andy Erlam, one of a group of four voters taking action against Mr Rahman, claimed police stood by as voters faced intimation in at least 40 polling stations in the borough.

'Electoral fraud': Andy Erlam, left, is leading a group of four voters taking action against Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman, right, alleging as many as 15,000 fraudulent votes helped his reelection last year 

The group wants election commissioner Richard Mawrey - who is sitting as a judge at an Election Court trial in London - to declare the result of the May 2014 election void and order a re-run.

Mr Rahman denies wrongdoing.

Statistics showed that nearly 240,000 people live in the Tower Hamlets borough and the mayoral election had around 180,000 registered electors, Mr Erlam told the court.

He said his 'guesstimate' was that a total of 10,000 to 15,000 votes in the combined 2014 local council and mayor elections in Tower Hamlets had been forged or affected by intimidation. He told Mr Mawrey he thought there had been 'intimidation of voters' at more than 40 polling stations.

He said there was evidence that police at many, if not most, of those polling stations had either 'refused' to intervene or taken 'exceptionally ineffective measures' to stop intimidation.

Previously a Labour Commons candidate in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and Bexleyheath, south-east London, Mr Erlam stood for election to Tower Hamlets council on an anti-corruption ticket. 

Scenes inside the counting hall after votes were cast had been 'absolutely astonishing', Mr Erlam told Mr Mawrey. There were close to 1,000 people in the hall, the vast majority of whom wore the rosettes of Mr Rahman's Tower Hamlets First party, Mr Erlam said.

He said he did not know Mr Rahman and his decision to launch legal action was not personal. He also said there were witnesses with 'important evidence' who were frightened of coming forward.

'It’s not a personal vendetta against Lutfur Rahman,' Mr Erlam told the judge. 'It’s about democracy. It is to be defended and fought for and it should not be taken for granted.'

Challenge: Mr Erlam's group wants election commissioner Richard Mawrey - who is sitting as a judge at an Election Court trial in London - to declare the result of the May 2014 election void and order a re-run

The group of four voters have mounted a challenge under the provisions the Representation Of The People Act. Lawyers for the group have made a series of allegations, including 'personation' in postal voting and at polling stations, and ballot paper tampering.

Mr Rahman says there is 'little if any' evidence of wrongdoing against him. His lawyers have described the group of four’s claims as invention, exaggeration and 'in some cases downright deliberately false allegations'.

The hearing continues.
