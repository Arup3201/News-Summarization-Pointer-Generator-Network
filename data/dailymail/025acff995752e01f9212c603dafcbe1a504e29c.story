It was hardly billed as a round-the-world cruise on the QEII. Far from it.

For one group of willing adventurers, their expedition instead involved sailing through the rough seas of the North Pacific Ocean amid tons of debris from the Japanese Tsunami.

Marcus Eriksen and his 11 companions have spent the last month documenting the rubbish making its way towards North America to determine its effects on marine life and help track its transit since the disaster.

Rubbish cruise: Marcus Eriksen and other crew members sail from Japan to Hawaii to collect and analyse debris from the Japanese tsunami

One for the collection: Members of the expedition with some of the debris they hauled in from the Pacific Ocean using fishing nets

Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year.

While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America.

Mr Eriksen, whose non-profit group the 5 Gyres Institute has been working to reduce plastics polluting the oceans, and his team sailed 4,000 miles across the Pacific before making it into Hawaii this week.

'While we were doing this, we were very much aware of the tragedy,' Eriksen told ABCNews.

'We are in the middle of nowhere and we are seeing one piece of trash every three and a half minutes.'

All sorts at sea: The crew's biggest find was this fishing boat, which was originally about 16ft long before it broke in half

Doing his head in: Some of the trash found during the month-long 'cruise' across the north Pacific

Their biggest find was half a fishing boat, which Eriksen believes was originally about 16 feet long. Around 50 or 60 fish were found living inside.

'What's now a wreck of a boat has become a floating reef system for this crowd,' Eriksen wrote in his blog chronicling the journey.

Mr Eriksen, who has spent 12 years studying plastic trash in the world's oceans, says the Pacific is 'one giant garbage patch'.

He will be relaying his data back to a marine research institute, which will analyse the garbage as part of its mapping of the tsunami debris.

Last month, the biggest item to wash up on U.S. shores - a 70ft-long Japanese dock - was found on a beach in Oregon.

Trash talk: The dock washed up on Agate Beach in Oregon last month after floating for nearly 15 months across the Pacific Ocean from Japan

Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific

On fast tides: The latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris, shown here in a graphic interpretation of a NASA satellite image, from the Japanese tsunami will hit North American shores far sooner than expected

The State Department of Parks and 
Recreation said the Japanese consulate in Portland, Oregon, traced the 
seven-feet-tall concrete and steel floating dock washed up on the beach 
to a manufacturer in Japan.

The dock carried a metal placard 
naming the manufacturer as Zeniya Ocean Service Engineering Ltd, which 
builds docks and floating marine structures and is dated June 2008.

The latest computer models estimate 
that thousands of tonnes of the debris, which now stretches 4,000 
nautical miles across the north Pacific, will start washing up this 
October and continue to do so into late 2013.

Projections made earlier this year by the
 International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, 
suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 
and March 2014.

But predictions from the Japanese 
government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according 
to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November.

U.S. coastal states, already suffering from severe budget cuts in the wake of the financial crisis, are having their finances strained further by the need to fund the clean-up of their beaches, which could cost up to $200million.

Bizarre find: This Harley-Davidson was found on a remote beach on the west coast of British Columbia last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year

Poignant: Items from the disaster have also been recovered in Alaska, like this sandal

Debris: Toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the Pacific

Earlier
 this year, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's 
devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on
 a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan.

Misaki
 Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball 
discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton 
Island.

Mr Baxter, who also 
found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his 
wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball.

And in May, the Japanese owner of a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the 
West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle.

The
 owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, 
in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson 
representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, 
the broadcaster reported today.

Peter Mark, was combing the beach on Haida Gwaii islands when he made the discovery.
