A tone-deaf teenager who suffered a concussion has astonished his family by suddenly being able to play music effortlessly.

Lachlan Connors, a high school junior from Denver, Colorado, now plays 13 instruments - even though he has never learned to read music.

But he didn't always have such a talent; as a younger student he loved sport, dreamed on a career playing lacrosse - and had no passion for music.

'He really had no talent,' his mother 
Elsie Hamilton told CBS Denver. 'I would say, "Can't you hear what's next?" with 
something like "Mary Had a Little Lamb" or "Twinkle, Twinkle Little 
Star" and he’d say "No".'

Bizarre: Teenager Lachlan Connors suffered a concussion and could suddenly play music effortlessly

When he was in the sixth grade, he was playing lacrosse with his local team when he fell backwards and smacked the back of his head against the ground, suffering a concussion.

'I remember getting up and feeling 
really dazed,' he told CBS. 'I didn't really understand something bad had happened.'

The doctors told him he could return to the field, but he went on to suffer another couple of hard hits to the head, which sent him to hospital and caused him to suffer epileptic seizures.

As his condition worsened, he started to hallucinate and doctors told him he should not play contact sports anymore - but there was one bizarre good side effect: his new-found musical talent.

In hospital: He remained in hospital for weeks after taking knocks to the head during sports games

Lachlan could be one of a handful of people around the world who have suffered a brain injury or head trauma and later woke up with amazing musical, artistic or mathematical abilities, known as acquired savant syndrome.

While research into the cause is ongoing, there is no single theory explaining all savants.

Many researchers believe the underlying cause of savant syndrome occurs when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain.

It is extremely rare for a savant to lose their skills after they have acquired them.

He said he can now play as many as 13 instruments, including piano, guitar, mandolin, ukelele, harmonica, karimba and bagpipes - both Scottish and Irish ones.

'Music is the thing that gets me up in the morning,' he said.

His mother called his playing 'absolutely beautiful'.

His doctor, Dr. Spyridon Papadopoulos, said the theory is that the concussions switched on part of Lachlan's brain that had previously been dormant.

'The thought is just a theory - that this was a talent laying latent in his brain and somehow was uncovered by his brain rewiring after the injury,' he said.

'Clearly something happened in his 
brain and his brain had to recover from injury and change happened. And 
change may have uncovered this ability no one knew he had.'

Talent: Before the accidents, he never understood music but now he plays 13 instruments with ease

Multi-talented: He shows the CBS reporter how to play the accordion, just one of his many instruments

Collection: He can also play the karimba, an African instrument which is known as the thumb piano

Theory: Doctors said that the bumps to the head may have rewired his brain, unleashing the talent

Lachlan no longer suffers seizures but told CBS that he found it comforting to know composer Frédéric Chopin had suffered from exactly the same type.

The condition of suddenly developing a talent - musical, artistic or mathematical - is called acquired savant syndrome and is believed to occur when the right brain compensates for an injury on the left brain.

Last year, another Denver man, Derek Amato, said that following a concussion after divig into a shallow pool, he could play eight instruments even though he'd never had a lesson in his life.
