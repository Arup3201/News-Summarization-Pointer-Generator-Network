A host of ridiculous Victorian inventions so strange they were never made it into production have been revealed for the first time.

The quirky designs, which include a corset with inflatable bust, a portable bath and a ventilating hat, have been held at the National Archives in Kew, Richmond, for 150 years.

Known as the ‘age of invention’, the era welcomed breakthroughs  from the likes of Robert Stevenson, who was famed for his construction of lighthouses, and engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel - who designed the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship.

A design for a corset with an expandable bust, invented by F.Parsons in 1881. It works by inflating the cups with a tube to make the breasts appear larger 

The Bonafide Ventilating Hat, invented by John Fuller & Co. in 1849, was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time

And everyday people began coming up with their own creations in the hope that they would hit on a big idea that could change their lives.

The inventing craze was kick-started when laws allowing ideas to be copyrighted quickly and cheaply were introduced in 1843.

Each design, such as the Anti-Garrotting Cravat and a portable hair brushing machine, was logged in enormous books which were then archived.

It also includes designs for a moustache protector, a pair of glasses with two sets of lenses and a gadget that doubles up as a knife and fork, as well as a device to get shoes on and off.

The inventions have been collecting dust at the National Archives until record specialist for registered designs, Julie Halls, sifted through them.

She has now complied them into a book called ‘Inventions that Didn’t Change the World’.

Described as a useful new design the portable bath, which is set upon wheels, was designed by Thomas Simmons and Ann Street in Birmingham in 1861

The Desideratum Combined Knife and Fork, invented by, Messrs Arnold and Son in 1881 was designed with the intentions that people would be able to eat with one hand

Mrs Halls said: ‘These designs were registered in the mid-1800s following the introduction of the Utility Designs Act which protected “useful” inventions under copyright.

‘It was much cheaper and quicker for smaller inventors to register their designs this way rather than go down the long, expensive patenting route.

‘There was a rush of inventors wanting to copyright their ideas.’

She explained that the designers had to take their inventions to the New Designs Registry at Somerset House in London where they would be given a registered design number.

‘Designers had to provide two identical drawings of their designs, one of which was stuck into a huge leather-bound volumes and the other would be returned to the copyright holder,’ she added.

‘Gradually these volumes of designs built up and because they belonged to the Government they eventually ended up at the National Archives for safekeeping.

A design for an Anti - Garotting Cravat, invented by Walter Thornhill in 1862 - the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting

A moustache protector, designed by Alfred Arculus in 1867, is among several designs that never made it into production from the Victorian era of inventions

‘These enormous tomes are full of the most amazing inventions, a lot of which never saw the light of day.

‘At that time there was such a culture of entrepreneurship and a real interest in how things worked, partly thanks to the success of inventors like Stevenson and Brunel.

‘It’s surprising how many designs were submitted by people inventing things to do with their own line of business.

‘Surgeons would register designs for surgical instruments and cooks would register designs for kitchen products.

‘The designs seem humorous or inexplicably strange now but a lot of them made sense in the context of the period of time.

‘A lot of the problems these inventions set out to solve have been lost in the mist of time but back then they were real issues.

‘For example, the anti-garrotting cravat was designed in response to a real scare at that time when convicts who would have normally been sent to the colonies were being pardoned.

‘It was registered in 1862, the same year an MP was the victim of a robbery by garrotting.

‘The Bonafide Ventilating Hat was designed to stop gentlemen's heads overheating while wearing top hats, a big problem at the time.

‘My favourite is the corset with an expansible bust. Obviously body image was as big an issue for Victorian women as it is for us nowadays and this design allowed for the bust to be inflated using a tube.

‘The Victorian period was known as the age of invention and most people only know about the big inventions like trains, the telegraph and the telephone.

‘But there was a whole sub-culture of inventing going on which we never get to hear about.

‘These designs are little known about and have never been published before. We wanted to show people what a productive time it was.’

Designs reflected things that were possibly needed at the time like this one for an 'Invalid's Exercising Chair', invented by Robert Kerry, in 1852

Other inventions were a reflection of the time including a ventilating top hat and anti-garrotting cravat

Such designs were possibly too far fetched even for the Victorians and never made it into production

They were collecting dust and a record specialist turned them into book 'Inventions that Didn't Change the World'
