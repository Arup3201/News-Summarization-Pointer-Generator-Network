Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, was found dead inside the cramped container at Tilbury Docks in Essex on August 16

The father-of-two was among a group of 35 immigrants, including 13 children, who were discovered on a freight ferry. 

Two lorry drivers have already appeared in court in connection with the case, while McGlinchey has been remanded in custody to appear before Basildon Magistrates Court tomorrow.

Stephen McLaughlin, 34, and Timothy Murphy, 33, both from Londonderry, have both been charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK.

They are due to appear next at Basildon Crown Court in November.

The surviving immigrants were rescued when when staff heard screaming and banging coming from the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, which had arrived on a P&O vessel from Zeebrugge, northern Belgium.

The group is believed to have been part of a tiny Sikh minority in Afghanistan and fled after suffering persecution. 

After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness. 

Members of the group, aged between  one and 72, were treated in local hospitals following the incident and survived the ordeal. 

They are in the process of claiming asylum in the UK after travelling to Europe in a lorry before reportedly spending 18 hours in the cargo container en route to the UK. 

Belgian police believe the immigrants were already inside when the container was delivered to the port before setting sail for Britain.
