Former first lady of South Carolina Jenny Sanford wants a family court judge to order Rep. Mark Sanford, her cheating ex-husband, to stay sober while taking care of their youngest son.

Jenny Sanford filed a court motion last week requesting that a judge ban she and her husband from making disparaging comments about 
each other in front their teenage son and from 'consuming or being under the influence of illegal or unprescribed prescription drugs or excessive amounts of alcohol' while caring for him.

Sanford also asked the court to require her ex to undergo psychiatric and 
psychological evaluations and take anger management and parenting 
courses.

The court motion said both Sanfords 
should be restrained from exposing their youngest son overnight to a 
member of the opposite sex 'who could reasonably be construed as a 
paramour.'

Jenny Sanford
 wants the court to appoint an impartial guardian to look after the 
interests of the youngest of their four sons, Blake, as well.

'It is the 
defendant's behavior that has led the plaintiff to needing to bring this
 action in the best interests of the minor child,' the motion said.

In the Aug. 28 court filing, Jenny 
Sanford's attorneys noted 'there has been a substantial change of 
circumstances such that a visitation schedule should be put in place 
that limits defendant's visitation with the minor child.'

The
 motion notes the while both Sanfords are in 
the public eye 'this factor should not outweigh the best interests of 
the child at issue or outweigh all other considerations.'

A separate filing asks the court record 
concerning issues to Blake be sealed. It said the 
circumstances requiring a change in visitation will then be outlined in 
an amended complaint filed once that is done.

Mark Sanford, who was the South Carolina governor when the two were married, bizarrely disappeared for five days in 2009 only to return from Argentina to acknowledge an affair with a woman to whom he is now engaged.

Jenny Sanford soon sued for divorce, which was granted in 2010.

The couple has four sons together, ranging in age from 15 to 22.

Mark Sanford proposed to his former mistress, Maria Belen Chapur, in August of 2012.

Despite the ongoing fall out from his 
extra-marital affair Mark Sanford was elected to the House of Representatives last year to a seat that he held for three terms in the 1990s before becoming governor of his home state.

Asked about her latest court battle with her former husband, Jenny Sanford said in an email Tuesday: 'I have no comment on this private matter other than to say that the restraints and other relief requested are common or standard practices frequently requested to protect minor children in similar custody situations.

'The court has been asked to apply the standard restraints to both of us,' he said.

The Associated Press also left phone messages with Mark Sanford seeking comment.

In July a family court judge ordered the couple to work with a mediator to resolve a dispute over putting more money in the trust funds of their two youngest sons. The accounts set up for their older boys at the time of the divorce were larger because they were closer to college.

Last year, the Sanfords settled another complaint that Sanford violated the divorce agreement by being in his ex-wife's home without permission. He said he was there watching the 2013 Super Bowl with his son.
