Spectators basked in sunshine today as London welcomed 2013 with a New Year's Day parade that celebrated the city's Olympics glory.

Organisers said more than 500,000 people had enjoyed the fair weather as floats, cheerleaders and brass bands marched through the centre of the capital.

The stars of the show were the Olympic volunteers who welcomed the world to London in the summer and helped make the Games such a success.

'But also we are looking forward as well as backward, because I think the Games Makers have shown that there's a great volunteering spirit in this country.
