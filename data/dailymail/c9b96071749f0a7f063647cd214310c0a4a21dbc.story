A father-of-two died after suffering brain damage when medics failed to diagnosed and treat his severe ear infection.

Rikki Baker, 31, died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in July 2010.

His life could have been saved by a simple course of antibiotics, it was later concluded.

Rikki Baker (pictured with his wife, Alicia, and their sons, Eddie and George), 31, died after he developed a severe middle ear infection which was misdiagnosed as a less serious outer ear infection

Mr Baker went to the hospital with his wife, Alicia, on July 24, 2010, suffering from a severe ear ache, vomiting, dizziness, light intolerance and a fever.

Instead of being seen by an A&E doctor, he was referred by the receptionist to see a nurse at the  walk in centre on the hospital site.

The nurse wrongly diagnosed him as suffering from an infection of the external ear canal and sent him home with ear drops.

Had he been seen by an A&E doctor, he would probably have been correctly diagnosed with a more serious middle ear infection.

As the infection was not properly treated, it spread from his ear to his brain and caused irreversible damage.

After leaving the walk in centre, Mr Baker’s condition deteriorated further and he was drifting in and out of consciousness.

His wife called an out of hours GP service and NHS Direct but was not instructed to take him back to hospital.

On July 26 he suffered a fit at the family home in Exeter and was rushed to hospital by ambulance.

Mr Baker went to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital suffering from an ear ache, vomiting, dizziness and a fever. Rather than being seen by an A&E doctor, he was sent to the walk in centre on the hospital site to see a nurse who misdiagnosed him meaning he didn't get the life-saving treatment he needed

At this point he was finally diagnosed with an infection of the middle ear and underwent an operation to remove the infected bone and tissue.

However, the treatment came too late and he died on July 30 of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear.

Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust admitted that had Mr Baker been seen by a doctor on July 24, it would have resulted in him being given antibiotics, which would have treated his ear infection and prevented his death.

Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust has now agreed to pay an out-of-court settlement to the family for the failings in Mr Baker’s care.

Mrs Baker, 33, mother to the couple’s
 two children, now aged eight and seven, said: ‘Rikki was taken from us 
and he should never have died. He will miss watching George and Eddie 
grow up and we will always wish he was still here with us.

‘Knowing
 Rikki would have survived and been fine if he was given the correct 
treatment makes it even harder to come to terms with, but I am at least 
thankful the Trust has finally admitted it was their fault, it's a 
little bit of justice for Rikki.

‘Despite
 this, since Rikki’s death, we have never once had an apology from the 
Trust which leaves me questioning whether improvements have been made 
and whether they are serious about improving patient safety.

Mr Baker would probably have survived if he had been correctly diagnosed and given antibiotics sooner

‘I don’t think it’s a lot to ask for given I have lost my husband and two little boys have lost their dad.

‘I
 need to know that changes have been put into place to ensure this won't
 happen again to another family. People deserve a thorough examination 
by an appropriate medical professional, and this should be common 
practice.’

Following an inquest into Mr Baker’s death at the end of 2011, a coroner recorded a narrative verdict, saying that although he had died of a middle ear infection - a natural cause - there was evidence that vital signs had been missed which lead to a misdiagnosis. 

Deputy Coroner Darren Salter went on to 
ask for a review of procedures relating to the treatment of ear 
infections at the walk in centre on the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital site.

Luke Trevorrow, a medical law expert 
at Irwin Mitchell’s Bristol office, said: ‘This is a truly tragic case 
that has left two little boys without a father and Alicia shocked and 
devastated by the sudden loss of her husband.

‘It
 is obviously very difficult for the family to come to terms with the 
fact that had Rikki been referred to a doctor and given a simple course 
of antibiotics to treat the ear infection, he would in all likelihood 
still be alive today.

Mr Baker died at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital of brain damage and swelling caused by blood poisoning as a result of an acute infection of the middle ear

‘Instead,
 the family now have to live with knowing that more could have been done
 to prevent Rikki’s death and obviously no settlement can make up for 
that.

‘We believe that 
diagnosis of ear infections can be difficult even for experienced 
doctors and it should not therefore be a diagnosis that nurses are asked
 to make without assistance. We do not believe that they should be put 
in that position.

‘We 
are keen to see confirmation from the Trust about what training and 
procedures have been implemented to ensure the same errors cannot be 
made again and protect patient safety.’

Dr Alison Diamond, medical director at Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the walk in clinic, said: 'We would like to extend our apologies and condolences to Mrs Baker and her family.

'The Trust took over management of the walk in centre in April 2011. We carried out a thorough review to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic event and ensure that any learning for the service and its staff was quickly identified and implemented.

'These included tightening protocols around the assessment and treatment of otitis media and otitis externa [ear infections], providing additional staff training around ear infections and working to ensure all consultation notes are comprehensive and detailed.

'The Trust apologises unreservedly for the failings identified in Mr Baker’s care.'
