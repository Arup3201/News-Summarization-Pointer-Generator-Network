Giorgio Armani has called Anna Wintour 'unprofessional' for skipping his fall 2014 show in favor of flying on to Paris Fashion Week.

Mr Armani is so furious that he held a press conference to openly denounce the U.S. Vogue editor after his fashion show on Monday - Milan Fashion Week's final day.

‘She took an airplane, dumped [me] and went to Paris…’ said the designer, 79, whose brand is a major advertiser in Ms Wintour's magazine. 'It's not professional.’

Unhappy: Giorgio Armani (pictured taking a final bow at his fashion show on Monday) has spoken out against Anna Wintour's absence at his show

He added: ‘She is influential and powerful. But, perhaps, I’m influential as well.’

Mr
 Armani says Ms Wintour assured him that other high-ranking 
representatives from her publication attended the show in her place.

But the designer was not impressed by this.

‘She
 said she was sending her people. But if you go to see your dentist and 
he puts you in the hands of his assistant, what’s your reaction?’ he 
said.

A spokesperson for 
Vogue told WWD that ‘Anna has the greatest respect for Giorgio Armani 
and everything he has done for Italy and fashion worldwide.

‘Unfortunately,
 with the fashion calendar now running for more than a month, there are 
some shows that Anna is not able to attend.’

Mr
 Armani blames Ms Wintour’s absence on the fact that he is the only 
influential designer to show on the final day of Milan Fashion Week – a 
prestigious schedule slot that he has held for the past two decades.

Around town: Ms Wintour had been spotted in the front row of other Milan Fashion Week shows before leaving for Paris, including Versace (left) and Aquilano Rimondi (right)

He
 told reporters backstage after his preview show that the Milan Fashion 
Week calendar needs to be altered to maintain high-profile designers 
until the end.

Mr Armani explained that the Camera della Moda, which presides over the schedule, is at fault.

‘When we decided to show the last day, other big brands were involved. But currently this is an empty day,’ he said.

In
 the last few years Mr Armani has been an outspoken critic of the Camera
 della Moda’s refusal to coordinate its fashion week dates with the 
world’s other major fashion weeks.

Currently,
 there is an overlap, giving fashion editors and buyers a maximum of 
twelve hours between the end of one city's fashion week and the 
beginning of another.

Ms 
Wintour has been known to leave Milan Fashion Week early for this 
reason. She also often leaves Paris Fashion Week early to return to New 
York to publish Vogue.

What she missed: Mr Armani's collection exhibited his signature for tailoring, fabricated in a primary wash of grey and green

However,
 this season she may stay for Paris’s entire duration in order to catch 
Nicolas Ghesquière’s debut show for Louis Vuitton, which is scheduled 
for March 5 – the event’s final day.

Mario
 Boselli, the Camera della Moda president told WWD that his organization
 spoke with Mr Armani after his press conference to resolve their 
issues.

‘We met Mr Armani 
earlier and he is totally fine now. In a certain way, it’s right that 
the important journalists stay until the end of the week, and next 
season, we will try to guarantee the presence of other big brands the 
last day,’ he said.
