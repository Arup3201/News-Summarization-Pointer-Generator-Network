The first details about the tragic victims of the massacre at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin earlier today are starting to emerge.

Six people were shot dead by an unknown attacker, and three more critically wounded, before the gunman was killed engaging the police.

At least two of the victims at the Oak Creek temple were priests, who had gathered to tend to the needs of worshippers at the Sunday morning ceremony.

Another was a police officer, who was left fighting for his life in hospital after receiving multiple gunshot wounds to the face and abdomen.

Dead: The president of the temple, Satwant Kaleka, was shot by the gunman after fighting back

Prayer: Mr Kadeka's son Amardeep kneels in a parking lot near the site of the massacre

The identity of the shooter is currently unknown, but he is believed to have been a white man in his 30s, a former soldier with a skinhead and possibly a member of a white supremacist race hate group.

Most of the victims have not yet been identified, but the stories of some of those caught in the horrific shooting spree have been revealed.

One of the priests who died in the massacre was identified by a temple-goer as priest Parkash Singh, a 30-something father of two.

Worshipper Manminder Sethi told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Mr Singh was 'a good guy, a noble soul'.

He added that the priest's wife, son and daughter had only recently moved from India to join him in Oak Creek, where Mr Singh had been living for several years.

The temple's president, 65-year-old Satwant Kaleka, was shot dead by the attacker after trying to fight back.

His son Amardeep said that the community leader had attempted to 'knife and tackle the shooter', but was unsuccessful and died of his wounds while trying to hide in the temple.

Mr Kaleka's nephew Gurmit Kaleka told the Journal Sentinel that the victim was a father of two who had presided over the religious community since 1996.

Another nephew, Jatin Der Mangat, spoke of his grief at hearing of the shooting.

'It was like the heart just sat down,' he said. 'This shouldn't happen anywhere.'

Terrified: Crowds of friends and relatives gathered outside the temple desperate for more information

number of victims, suspects and possible hostages

Another victim sent to hospital by the gunman was a police officer, a 20-year veteran who was ambushed by the attacker and was shot multiple times.

He is undergoing surgery for his injuries, but is expected to survive.

Police are treating the incident as an act of 'domestic terrorism' - partly based on tattoos sported by the gunman.

It is the second mass shooting to hit the U.S. in less than three weeks, after James Holmes opened fire on a packed movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and injuring 58.
