Luna Park could be forced to tear down its newest ride after the harbourside amusement park failed to get proper planning approval for its 50-metre drop tower.

The Hair Raiser ride, which drops at 80km per hour from 50-metres in the air, opened at the heritage-listed Luna Park last November.

While it's the first new ride to be built at the 80-year-old Luna Park in a decade, it has since been revealed the theme park's operators did not lodge a development application with the NSW Department of Planning, the Mosman Daily reports.

The government has ordered Luna Park's owners, Brookfield Multiplex, to lodge a development application by November or they will tear the ride down.

Luna Park was initially given 14 days to respond to the government in August stating their reasons why the ride should not be removed.

Being listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, Luna Park must seek building approval from the Department of Planning.

In their response to the government, Brookfield Multiplex claimed they interpreted the existing approval as being allowed to make alterations to rides if it was needed for operational purposes. 

'The Department accepts this was genuinely Luna Park's interpretation, but we do not share it,' a department spokesman said.

A department application would require consultation with residents who would be able to give their opinion on the ride. 

The amusement park, built in 1935, has attracted a number of complaints from nearby residents due to noise and concerns about certain rides.

Luna Park has opened and closed several times over its 80 year history.

It closed for the first time and had most of the park demolished  in 1979 following the infamous ghost train fire that killed six children and one adult.

The amusement park closed again in 1988 due to ride repairs and just 13 months after reopening in 1995, it closed again partly due to probability. 

The current Luna Park has been operating since 2004 after further redevelopment.
