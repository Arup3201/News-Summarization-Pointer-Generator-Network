A burglary suspect has been given away by his stomach - after a trip through the jail's body scanner showed up two gold necklaces he had allegedly stolen.

Joseph Bravo Ramos, 21, was arrested on December 11, the day after a home invasion was reported in Safety Harbor, Florida.

Although he was initially arrested for reckless driving, police officers realized that his 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe had been reported stolen following the burglary.Â

Ramos was charged with grand theft. At the jail, he was ordered to walk through SecurPass X-Ray which showed up a 'large dark mass' in the thief's stomach, according to Tampabay.com.

The mass turned out to be two gold chains which the 21-year-old had swallowed before entering the jail.

Ramos underwent surgery to remove the necklaces at a local hospital before the jewellery was identified by the burglary victim.

The 21-year-old has been charged with grand theft and tampering with physical evidence. He is being held at Pinellas County jail on $15,000 bail.
