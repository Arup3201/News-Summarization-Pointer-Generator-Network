Hong Kong's leader said open elections would result in the city's poor dominating politics, as he ruled out reforms before talks scheduled to end three weeks of protest rallies began today.

Hours before student leaders and officials were due to meet, embattled chief executive Leung Chun-ying said free elections were impossible. 

There are fears that neither side will find common ground during the talks, with both seemingly unwilling to compromise – meaning further protest action and clashes are likely.

Hong Kong's leader, Leung Chun-ying, middle, said open elections would result in the city's poor dominating politics, as he ruled out reforms before talks scheduled to end three weeks of protest rallies in the city began

Protests in Hong Kong continued hours before talks between student officials and leaders were due to begin

Mr Leung, who has refused to resign, said if the public were allowed to nominate candidates, the city's poor would dominate the electoral process. 

'If it's entirely a numbers game and numeric representation, then obviously you'd be talking to the half of the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month,' he is reported as saying.

He said there was room to discuss how to form a key committee that would pick candidates.

Leung said such changes could be covered in a second round of consultations over the next several months. 

Student protest leaders are demanding that voters be allowed to skip the committee and directly choose candidates.

Leung would not offer a timeline for how long the government would allow protests to continue in the city of 7.2 million, but he said police could move to clear the streets at any time. 

He also said that Hong Kong had been 'lucky' that Beijing had not yet felt the need to intervene in the stand-off. 

The Telegraph reported him as saying: 'There is a thin line between what we do in Hong Kong and what (leaders in) Beijing think or might think they have to do.'

China has offered Hong Kong the chance to vote for their next chief executive in 2017. But only those vetted by a committee expected to be loyal to Beijing will be allowed to stand.

Almost 20 per cent of Hong Kong's 1.3 million residents,  are under an official poverty line introduced in September last year.

Tens of thousands of low-income families and immigrants are forced to live in tiny subdivided units.
