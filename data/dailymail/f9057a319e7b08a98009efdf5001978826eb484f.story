It is the erotic thriller that set the record as the fastest-selling paperback of all time and sold over 70 million copies worldwide.

No official copies were available in China though, where nobody dared to translate Fifty Shades of Grey assuming that it would immediately be banned by the censors.

But there's no stopping Christian Grey and the book has become a hit anyway after being translated into Chinese for the Taiwan market and the smuggled across to the mainland.

Best-seller: It may have sold over 70 million copies worldwide, but one Chinese e-tailer is selling knock-off copies of E.L. James's Fifty Shades Of Grey

Whilst one of E.L. James's novels sells 
for around £13 in British bookstore, Chinese e-tailer, Taobao is 
selling pirate copies of the whole trilogy for the same price.

There are up to 400 booksellers advertising pirated copies on the site, and while they may look exactly the same as the originals these copies are actually printed in the city of Guangzhou from contraband editions.

Speaking about the sensation, a spokesman for the Foreign Multi-Resource bookstore told The Telegraph: 'Not many people know about it yet.

Counterfeit: Whilst one of E.L. James's novels sells for around £13 in British bookstore, one Chinese e-tailer, Taobao, is selling pirate copies of the whole trilogy for the same price

'There has been no publicity, so it is only a cult book at the moment.

'Most of the feedback we get is that it is very repetitive.'

Whilst sales are high, Chinese social media is awash with mixed reviews and rated the novel 5.3 out of 10 because of its 'tedious style'.

One such user gave her opinion of the book, writing: 'Who would have thought that such a vulgar novel would be so popular all over the world, even breaking Harry Potter's record?

'I suppose nothing can compete with sex.'

Spot the difference: They may look exactly the same as the originals, but these copies are actually printed in Guangzhou from smuggled editions

In early 2012, it was announced that there was professional interest in a film production of the Fifty Shades trilogy, which is hotly anticipated and still underway.

The Social Network producers Michael De Luca and Dana Brunetti, who were hand-pick by E.L. James herself, will produce it and there have even been rumours that Angelina Jolie is interested in directing the film.
