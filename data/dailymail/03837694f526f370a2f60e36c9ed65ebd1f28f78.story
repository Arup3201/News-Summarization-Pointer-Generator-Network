Two civilians and a bomb squad officer rescued a 72-year-old driver who was stuck inside of a car bursting with flames on the San Diego (405) Freeway on Christmas Day.

The driver of the Mercedes Benz crashed his station wagon into the highway divider on the northbound Freeway in Sherman Oaks California.

NBC Los Angeles reports that the car crashed at approximately 1:45 p.m and that LAPD bomb squad officer and 26 year veteran Don Thompson noticed the rising smoke on his way to work. He felt a sense of duty to save the driver from the flaming vehicle.

'You know you have to do something and save someone's life, or you're going to watch someone burn to death alive. You have to do what you have to do,' said Thompson.

Two other good Samaritans also noticed the fire and pulled over to assist.

Thompson rushed over to the burning car and managed to unbuckle the driver's seat belt. The driver was unconscious but Thompson was able to remove the man from the dangerous vehicle with the help of civilians.

'He only had maybe 10, 15 seconds to be saved. Just out of the grace of God I was there,'Thompson said. 'We had some good Samaritans there. He made it.'

Don Thompson knew he had to help the driver when he spotted the crash and the fire as he was driving on his way to work

The man was rushed over to a hospital where he survived. Officer Don Thompson was treated for minor injuries.

'In any other time frame it would have been his time,' said Thompson of the driver. Luckily this time, he was saved thank to the goodwill of those around him.

Thompson told NBC Los Angeles that he heard people screaming, 'The car is gonna blow up!'

Luckily it didn't due to the fast response from the LAPD fire department.

The Mail Online contacted the LAPD to inquire about the driver's identity but he remains anonymous at this time.

Thankfully to speedy reaction of the LA Fire Department, the car did not explode and cause more damage
