Former mayor: Officers with search dogs swooped on the home of Cllr Jonathan Farmer (pictured)

A Conservative former mayor and veteran army reservist has been dramatically arrested in an early-morning police raid and charged with owning a live 70-year-old Nazi wartime gun.

Officers with search dogs swooped on the home of Councillor Jonathan Farmer, 56, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and seized a German Walther PPK pistol dating back to the Second World War.

Police said they were acting on a tip-off and had a warrant to search his home for firearms. He will appear in court next Monday and could face a five-year jail sentence if found guilty.

Farmer - whose wife Susanah is acting town clerk of Wisbech - has temporarily stepped down from helping to run the local army cadet force.

He told the Fenland Citizen: ‘It was given to me by a friend, mainly because his wife wanted it out of the house. I just kept it in a cupboard.

‘When he gave it to me, he said not to fire it because it had been deactivated. He said it would blow my hand off, so I never did and I assumed it was pretty safe.

‘But I suppose I shouldn’t have kept it. It was a sentimental thing - and it’s a beautiful piece of engineering. My life as it was has been pretty much eviscerated.’

The Walther PPK handgun was a gift to the bomb disposal expert from a British veteran of the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy in 1944.

The soldier took the deadly weapon, a much-treasured war souvenir, from a captured German officer, and Farmer – the former mayor of Wisbech - has owned it for 30 years.

Farmer was arrested on January 19, taken to a police station at Kings Lynn, Norfolk, and bailed.

Farmer
 served as mayor of Wisbech from 2008 to 2009 and is a member of both 
Tory-ruled Fenland District and Wisbech Town councils.

He
 had degrees in law from Leicester De Montford, economics from Coventry 
and history from Birmingham universities - and has worked for most of 
his life as a design engineer in the aircraft industry, as well as being
 a civil servant.

Farmer served in the Territorial Army for
 32 years, rising to the rank of captain, and worked with the regular 
army as a staff officer at their headquarters in war-torn Bosnia in 
1997.

Jonathan Farmer

In early 2010 he was a senior member of a an election monitoring team in devastated Southern Sudan as he helped to ensure the poverty-stricken African country's first free elections in 25 years.

Coventry-born Mr Farmer is a Freeman of both his home city and London. He moved to Wisbech from Coventry in 2000 and got married at the town’s St Peter’s Church.

Farmer is now set to meet both Fenland Council leader Alan Melton and his deputy Chris Seaton following his arrest. They are expected to explain that he will be automatically suspended.

A Cambridgeshire Constabulary spokesman said: ‘A 56-year-old man from Wisbech has been charged with possessing a firearm and is due to appear in court next month.’
