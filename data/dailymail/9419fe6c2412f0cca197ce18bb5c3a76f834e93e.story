Steve Webb, pictured, the Pensions Ministers, has revealed plans to slash a bonus paid out to those who delay claiming their State pensions

Millions of Britons have been warned their State pension payout will be hit by controversial changes sneaked out by the Government before ministers head off on holiday.

At present, anybody can decide to delay claiming their State pension - and get a bonus worth around 10 per cent a year on their unclaimed State pension.

More than 1.2million pensioners in Britain currently receive a higher State pension because they deferred it, typically for a few years although many delay for a decade.

But Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, has revealed plans to slash this bonus in a move which will hit everybody who reaches State pension age on or after 6 April 2016.

Rather than a bonus worth 10.4 per cent a year of their unclaimed State pension, they will get a bonus worth only 5.8 per cent a year.

In a further blow, the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to them when they eventually decide to start claiming their State pension.

At present, they can either take a lump sum when they begin to claim the pension, or simply receive the higher weekly amount.

From April 2016, the chance to take the lump sum, which is popular with pensioners who often use the money to indulge themselves with a holiday or a new kitchen, is being axed.

Mr Webb came under fire today for putting out the statement about the explosive change on the last day of Parliament before the long summer recess begins.

It was one of 31 ‘written ministerial statements’ put out raising suspicions that the Government was trying to bury the bad news.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The Government is using the last day of term to shovel out the less popular outstanding announcements before heading off on holiday.’

The impact of the technical change is eye-watering for future generations of pensioners who want to defer their State pension in order to receive a higher amount in the future.

Take the example of two 65-year-old men who retire this year – Mr Smith receives his full State pension, worth £113.10 a week, and Mr Taylor defers it for ten years.

Mr Taylor begins to receive his higher State pension in 2024. By 2030, the total amount that he has received from his State pension is higher than the total amount received by Mr Smith.

That is, he is better off after just six years of claiming his State pension.

Under the new system, it would take him 14 years of claiming his State pension after the ten-year deferral to be better off than Mr Smith, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.

But the problem for Mr Taylor is that he will be nearly 90 by the time he reaches this moment, which is quite a gamble to take as he might die in his 60s, 70s or 80s.

In a further blow, the rules are also being changed about how the money is paid to pensioners when they eventually decide to start claiming State pension

Alan Higham, retirement director at the investment company Fidelity Worldwide said: ‘It will be a big reduction in what people who defer their pension today under the current rules enjoy.

‘The new state pension [which comes into force in April 2016] is immensely complicated and there are winners and losers depending on whatever side of it you fall.’

Anybody who has already deferred their pension will not be affected by the changes, and will continue to accrue a higher State pension at the current rate of 10.4 per cent a year.

People who reach State pension age before 6 April 2016 will also be able to defer under the current terms.

But the change will hit anybody who reaches State pension age on or after 6 April 2016 and would like to defer their State pension.

On 6 April 2016, the State pension age for a man will still be 65 and it will be around 63 for a woman.

The State pension age is currently being increased to 65 for men and women in 2018, 66 in 2020, 67 by 2028 and will continue to rise, expected to reach 68 by 2036.

A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions, which was advised by the Government Actuary, said: ‘It is important to set a fair deferral rate for the new State pension.’

Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which campaigns for fairness between the generations, said: ‘This is a good step towards addressing increasing longevity but much more needs to be done.

‘A brave government would stop paying the State pension altogether to wealthy pensioners for the sake of younger generations already over-burdened with debt.’
