Dr Nathalie MacDermott, is preparing to return to Liberia to help treat Ebola victims, after a fearing she contracted the disease on a fortnight placement

A doctor who feared she had contracted Ebola while working in Liberia treating victims is today preparing to return to the disease-ravaged country.

Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, confined herself to her flat for three weeks after returning from West Africa.

But having been given the all-clear, the 32-year-old said she cannot sit and watch people dying without trying to help.

Dr MacDermott spent two weeks in Liberia with relief organisation Samaritan's Purse earlier this summer. 

During that time she watched as two colleagues, Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol fell ill with the deadly virus.

She helped nurse the pair before they were flown home for life-saving treatment.

Since then Ebola has claimed the lives of thousands more people, the World Health Organisation's current death toll standing at more than 3,800 people dead, and at least 8,000 infected.

While the virus has spread to Europe, Spanish nurse Teresa Romero Ramos becoming the first person to contract the disease outside of West Africa, Dr MacDermott is set to return to the disease's epicentre.

Reports from Liberia suggest the country's poor healthcare systems are buckling under the pressure, struggling to cope.  

Dr MacDermott told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales show: 'I think, unfortunately, things will be worse than when I was last there. 

'When I was last there the epidemic was clearly spiralling out of control and we were overwhelmed in terms of the number of patients and the number of beds we had.

'But that situation is now far, far worse and patients are often being turned away from Ebola treatment units because there are not enough beds for them and some of them are dying outside the treatment units. 

'I know that's the situation I'm going to right now.'

The medic said she would find it difficult to turn away desperately ill patients.

Unable to sit back and watch as people die in the West African nation, the 32-year-old is preparing to return to Liberia where reports suggest the healthcare systems are buckling under the pressure

Following her first trip, Dr MacDermott confined herself to her flat for 21 days to ensure she didn't have the virus, and risk passing it on. Pictured, a burial team in Liberia load a body bag into a waiting van

'It's very difficult to turn away somebody who needs healthcare and say you can't offer it to them because there is no bed and know the outcome is likely that they will die,' she said.

'But at the same time we're battling a very large epidemic and we have to do the small things at the beginning and hope that eventually it will have a large impact.'

On her first trip the medic, who was based at Swansea's Singleton Hospital but has now moved on as part of her training, saw only three of the roughly 100 patients she treated survive. 

Following advice from Public Health Wales, Dr MacDermott only kept in touch with friends and family via Skype after her return - and was even a virtual guest at a wedding.

Dr MacDermott took over the day-to-day running of the centre in the capital, Monrovia, when Dr Brantly, 33, and 59-year-old Ms Writebol were isolated after developing the condition.

Both were flown back to the United States for treatment and have since been cured, with Dr Brantly describing his return to health as 'miraculous'.

In the latest incidents Madrid nurse Mrs Romero Ramos is the first person known to have contracted the deadly virus outside West Africa.

Dr MacDermott worked at the same healthcare centre as Dr Kent Brantly, the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola. He was flown back to the US and has since survived, donating his blood to other victims 

And aid worker Nancy Writebol, the second American to catch the virus, was also working at the centre. Dr MacDermott was forced to take over running the facility when her American colleagues fell ill, nursing them both before they were repatriated to the US 

She had treated two Spanish missionaries who later died from Ebola. Her dog Excalibur was put down on Tuesday amid uncertainty over whether the animal was infected.

Australian Red Cross volunteer Sue Ellen Kovack is being monitored for the condition after treating patients in Sierra Leone.

Dr MacDermott said while she was concerned about contracting the condition herself she hoped she would be able to return to the UK for treatment if the worst happens.
