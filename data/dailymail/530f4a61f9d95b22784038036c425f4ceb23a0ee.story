Last month it was my first wedding anniversary. Just like any new wife, I made an extra-special effort to look good. I wore one of my favourite dresses, put on heels and carefully applied my make-up. Then, standing back, I assessed my reflection in the mirror - and burst into tears.

I should have been over the moon, heading out for a romantic evening with the man I loved. Instead, I had a meeting with a very different man indeed - my divorce lawyer.

Nobody gets married thinking that one day they'll have to sign divorce papers. I was no exception. I might have been nearing 40 when I walked down the aisle, with a four-year-old son from a previous relationship, but I still believed in happily ever after. 

Swept off her feet: Faith agreed to marry John after they had been together seven momths

To sign along that doomed dotted line less than a year later was devastating and humiliating. How could something go so wrong in such a short period of time?

I'd first met John - a 46-year-old carpenter - at my 39th birthday party in 2012 through his sister, who's a friend of mine.

I was a single mother to Xavier, then three, and had successfully built a life for myself - I wasn't looking for a man to complete me.

I'm not one of those women who feels they need a strong arm to hang on, and while it did get a little lonely on occasions, I didn't want to meet someone for the sake of it. I felt that any man would have to significantly enhance my and Xavier's life for me to feel they were worth our time.

And from the moment I met John, this is exactly what he did.

There were no lightning bolts - he wasn't even my type physically. Yet I felt oddly drawn to him. It might be a cliché but I really did feel as if I'd known him for years.

After that first meeting, John persistently wooed me. He sent me roses and constantly texted and phoned. 

On our first date, he drove for miles just to take me to an Indian restaurant he thought I would like. I hadn't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time

I'd be lying to say I didn't feel a flutter of excitement - but I was also wary of letting my guard down.

I can remember, late one evening, his number showing up yet again on my mobile phone. I was so unused to a man pursuing me that I pulled the duvet over my head and refused to answer.

I'd been out of the dating loop for so long, I had no idea how to respond. But eventually I let him take me out for dinner.

On our first date, he drove for miles just to take me to an Indian restaurant he thought I would like. I hadn't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time.

I was overwhelmed and for the first time in years I allowed myself to think that maybe I didn't need to be on my own after all.

Most of all, though, I wanted my son to have a father figure in his life and John made me hope this might be possible.

To say he was brilliant with Xavier, who has Down's syndrome, would be an understatement. They took to each other instantly and with incredible ease. 

Perfect father figure: John got on well with Xavier, her son from a previous relationship

Sometimes John would come to our house in the evenings, and Xavier would climb on to his lap and throw his arms around John's neck. Seeing them together made me feel so content.

Then, a few weeks into our relationship, John carved a beautiful puppet theatre from wood for Xavier. Looking back, this was the turning point. Seeing John and my son together made me want to weep for Xavier and what I'd nearly deprived him of.

Perhaps if it hadn't been for this I might have taken things more slowly, been more rational.

When John proposed in September, seven months after we met, I didn't hesitate. He even remembered a ring I'd fallen in love with in a magazine - an art-deco-style platinum band. Most importantly, he said he wanted to give me and Xavier the security we deserved.

We married in February last year - a magical winter wedding in one of my favourite places in North Devon. I was marrying a man I loved, and he loved me and my son, too. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot.

I see things differently now. I see that I paid for the wedding and put in all of the work to make it happen. It was the start of a pattern. 

John didn't seem to be doing anything, or making any effort to make me happy

John moved into my home in Braunton, Devon, and - stupid as it might sound now - we agreed I would pay for the day-to-day bills. He would save his earnings from carpentry jobs to put towards the new house we were planning on buying together.

This seemed a fair exchange. I had royalties coming in from my novels, and substantial savings. I didn't for a second imagine that John might not be putting away money as we'd agreed.

Then, three months into our marriage, John dropped the bombshell that he hadn't saved anything. He'd lent the money to his father, he said. We had an almighty row - our first proper marital humdinger.

I wanted to believe him. Worse still, I needed to. We were in the early stages of marriage. I just couldn't allow doubts to creep in.

We soldiered on but, much as I wanted to ignore it, everything felt different.

From the moment John moved in, it seemed to me that he stopped making an effort. I was doing more than my share: paying the bills, taking care of Xavier and working on my latest novel to support us.

John didn't seem to be doing anything, or making any effort to make me happy. I could cope with the fact our sex life had dropped off a cliff, but he also seemed to lose interest in Xavier, who worshipped the ground he walked on.

I sought solace in friends, who told me the first year of marriage is always the worst. Deep down I knew it was something more than this. I wasn't ready to face it yet, but an icy feeling of dread was starting to take hold.

Short-lived happiness: Faith didn't expect to celebrate her first wedding anniversary with a divorce lawyer

Six months after we married, John started to come home from work reeking of beer. He would plonk himself on the sofa and spend hours on his iPad. There was little communication between us. When we did talk, it was usually a row.

Things unravelled with startling speed. It seemed to me that John had simply given up all pretence that he was the lovely man I'd fallen in love with. The façade, as I now saw it, was falling daily.

One night he came home drunk and staggering, and for the first time I was afraid of him. Trembling, I told him he was disgusting and that I didn't want him anywhere near Xavier.

He lashed back, saying: 'I didn’t marry Xavier - I married you.' Then he became aggressive and threw a pair of shoes across the room at me. It seemed, for the first time, that I was seeing his true colours.

I should have thrown him out there and then, but it still felt too soon to admit I'd made a terrible mistake. I was so ashamed that my marriage was failing so quickly.

Our marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating, unanswered questions

If I hadn't so desperately wanted it to work, I may have reacted differently. But my parents had enjoyed a long and contented marriage before my father passed away, and I was still under the delusion that I could achieve the same happiness with John.

Perhaps if we'd had the backdrop of a deeper relationship, it might have worked. But when the honeymoon was over, there was nothing substantial to sustain us.

My marriage was over - that much I knew. I could no longer deny a truth that was staring me in the face. I had absolutely no idea who my husband was.

Two weeks before Christmas last year, John simply failed to come home. Of course, I called the police because I had no clue where he was. They investigated and came back with the news that he'd told them he wasn't a missing person. He simply didn't want to be found by me.

I was utterly devastated. My instincts had been right but the reality was incredibly hard to accept.Our marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating, unanswered questions.

There's no denying John was not the man I thought he was. But who is he? I can't help but ask myself if he was only with me for a few months of rent-free living, or did he simply fall out of love with me?

Maybe I wasn't the woman he thought I was when we fell in love. I'll probably never know. Indeed, I haven't seen or spoken to John since the day he left, and all I want now is for him to agree to a divorce and cut me free, so we can put the whole sorry saga behind us.

For the past 12 months I've been living a lie, desperately trying to complete a jigsaw with a missing piece that won't fit.

And the worst of it is, I've put Xavier through it all in the hope of making his life better, when all I've done is make it worse.

But I've learnt my lesson. If something seems too good to be true then, most of the time, it probably is.

Some names have been changed.
