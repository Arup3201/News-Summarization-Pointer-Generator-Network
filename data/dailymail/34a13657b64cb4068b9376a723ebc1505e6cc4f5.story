It was once seen as gentle family viewing, set among a farming community in the Yorkshire Dales.

But Emmerdale horrified thousands of fans after an episode showed a car crash victim being suffocated by a serial killer – before the 9pm watershed.

Media watchdog Ofcom received almost 100 complaints and 50 were sent to ITV.

One viewer complained that the family-friendly show had shown scenes of 'sex and violence' in an effort to boost viewing figures

After driving Gennie Sharma off the road, serial killer Cameron Murray strangled his victim as she called for an ambulance. Viewers complained to Ofcom that the scenes were too graphic to be shown before 9pm

Minutes after the soap opera was broadcast on Thursday, ending at 8.30pm, viewers took to social networking site Twitter,  with many describing the scenes as ‘traumatising’ and too ‘morbid’ to be shown before 9pm.

One said the programme had been reduced to ‘sex and violence’ in an attempt to boost ratings. 

The drama airs at 7pm every night of the week for 30 minutes with an extra episode on Thursdays at 8pm. 

Fans who tuned in for the double bill saw popular character Gennie Sharma run off the road by serial killer Cameron Murray and his girlfriend Debbie Dingle.

After failing to kill his target while in the car, Murray suffocated her to death as she dialled for an ambulance, to the horror of many viewers.

Long-time viewer Debbie Hill yesterday said it was the latest example of unnecessary racy plotlines used by the drama.

The 48-year-old from Bolton said: ‘It was just awful. I lost my mum recently and I found it very upsetting … It wasn’t as if it was late at night. There will have been children watching.’

An ITV spokesperson said the scenes were the climax of a dramatic storyline featuring serial killer Cameron Murray (pictured) and suitable warnings were shown before the episode

She added that Emmerdale ‘used to be such a lovely, gentle show’ but that it was ‘all sex and violence now’ and ‘over the top’.

One mother wrote on Twitter: ‘Bit much pre-watershed...Think of kids that may be awake still!’ 

Another fan said: ‘Think @emmerdale went too far tonight. Feel physically sick. What happened to the watershed?’

A spokesman for ITV said yesterday: ‘This episode was the culmination of a very dramatic storyline which has been running for over a year.

'We made sure appropriate warnings were broadcast before the episode aired.’

Ofcom is deciding whether to formally investigate the show, which had a peak of 7million viewers during the episode.
