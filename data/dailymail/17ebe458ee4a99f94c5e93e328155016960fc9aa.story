Donna Matthews arriving at Blackburn Magistrates Court. She was convicted of using threatening behavior after trying to punch her daughter in the face in a 'drink-fuelled' brawl

A police officer was punched, kicked and bitten by a mob of school children after he tried to stop a mother and daughter from fighting outside in pyjamas.

Donna Matthews, 46, was spotted by the officer trying to punch her daughter in the face, before banging her face on a stone step outside her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. 

The officer tried to break up the alcohol-fuelled brawl, but was attacked by three children aged seven, ten and 13, who proceeded to bite, punch and kick him at the moment he was pulling the mother away from the daughter.

Defending, Jonathan Taylor told Blackburn Magistrates Court that she has had an alcohol problem since she was 16.

She began arguing with her daughter after the pair had been drinking.

The police officer saw the two women, one wearing a white vest and pyjama bottoms and the other wearing a white onesie, fighting at the front of the house.

Mr Taylor said: 'The officer was outside another address attending an unrelated incident when he saw a fight spill out of the house.

'He witnessed both women punching each other and Matthews tried to smash her daughter’s face into stone steps.

'Her daughter tried to gouge her eyes out and Matthews was in an extreme amount of pain.

'They were exchanging blows during the scuffle.

'As the officer tried to break up the fight, he was attacked by three children of primary school age - something he has not witnessed in 12 years as a police officer.'

He calmed the situation but when he later said he was going to arrest their mother, the children attacked him again.

Mr Taylor said Matthews’ daughter did not have any significant injuries and accepted she was equally to blame for the behaviour.

The police officer (not pictured) said he had never experience anything like the attack in 12 years of police work

Matthews suffered a black eye and a cut to her nose and pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour.

Sentencing, magistrate Austin Molloy said: 'You followed your daughter outside and it was a prolonged incident.

'There was harm caused to both participants and there were vulnerable children present.

'You have not taken full responsibility in this case.'

She was given an 18-month supervision order and given 100 hours of unpaid work.

Matthews must also pay £85 court costs and a £60 victim sucharge to be paid at £5 per week out of her income support benefit.
