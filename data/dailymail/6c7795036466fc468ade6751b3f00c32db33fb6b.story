People who are outgoing, hardworking, organised and relaxed don’t only shine at parties and job interviews.

They’re also less likely to suffer diseases like stroke, arthritis, and heart conditions, according to a new study.

And those who are anxious, moody, irritable, and prone to sadness are more likely to be diagnosed with such an illness.

People who are conscientious, open, agreeable and extroverted are less likely to suffer diseases like stroke, arthritis and diabetes. Anxious and moody neurotic people are more likely to suffer ill health, the study found

U.S. researchers found a strong link between personality types and disease, in the first long-term study of its kind.

They found that being highly conscientious, extroverted, open, agreeable and not very neurotic was associated with better health and lack of disease.

This could be because these types of people are more likely to eat healthily, take exercise, suffer less stress and communicate better with physicians, they said.

On the other hand, people who are highly neurotic – meaning they are anxious, worrisome, have mood swings and are often sad – are more likely to be diagnosed with a disease. 

This supports previous research found that neurotic people die earlier, although why this happens is not fully understood.

One theory is that they deal less effectively with stress, so their bodies release more of the hormone cortisol, which in large amounts can damage the immune system and organs, including the brain.

EXTROVERSION   

This trait includes characteristics such as excitability, sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness. Extroverts tend to be outgoing and energetic.

AGREEABLENESS

Agreeable people tend to be trusting, altruistic kind, affectionate, compromising and value getting along with others.

CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

Those high in conscientiousness tend to be hardworking, organised and mindful of details. They are dependable, dutiful, show self-discipline and work towards goals.

NEUROTICISM

Highty neurotic people tend to experience emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability, and sadness.

OPENNESS  

This trait features characteristics such as imagination, curiosity and insight. Those high in this trait look for new experiences and tend to have a broad range of interests.

Through a questionnaire testing participants’ personality, researchers scored people on the ‘Big Five’ personality traits.

These are extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness and neuroticism.

Four years later, they were asked if they had been diagnosed with a disease by a doctor.

The participants were scored on a scale of one to four on each of the personality traits.

Four meant their personality strongly displayed that trait, so a person who was scored four on the extroversion scale would be very talkative and outgoing, whereas a person who was scored one would be introverted and less talkative. 

Below, they describe the differences in health for each trait: 

CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

Conscientious people are hardworking, reliable, dutiful and able to control their impulses. They like things to be planned and like to achieve their goals.

The researchers found that being a conscientious person can protect against the onset of disease.  

Researchers found a one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for conscientiousness decreases the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 37 per cent.

It also decreases the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 27 per cent, arthritis by 23 per cent and diabetes by 20 per cent.

One of the researchers, Professor Joshua Jackson, told MailOnline they did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but added: 'Because it was a new diagnosis of diabetes, and everyone is an older adult, I would guess that most were type 2.'

Type 1 diabetes is caused when the body’s immune system incorrectly targets and kill the cells in the pancreas that are responsible for producing insulin. 

Type 2 diabetes is when the body becomes less able to respond to insulin. It is usually diagnosed in over 30 year-olds and is often associated with excess body weight. 

The link between conscientiousness and health could be because people who are conscientious are likely to carry out healthy behaviours like healthy eating and exercise, which are important for preventing diseases like stroke, high blood pressure and diabetes, researchers said.

OPENNESS

Open people are curious, imaginative, like playing with new ideas, and have a broad range of interests. 

A one unit increase on the 1 - 4 scale for openness decreased the odds of a stroke diagnosis by 31 per cent, heart conditions by 17 per cent, high blood pressure by 29 per cent, and arthritis by 21 per cent. 

Being more open might help a person be more creative in relieving stress and may improve their health through better communication with physicians. 

EXTROVERSION

Extroverted people are positive, assertive, talkative, social and like to be the life and soul of a party.

Researchers found a one unit increase in extroversion decreased only the odds of a high blood pressure diagnosis by 26 per cent.

An increase in neuroticism raised the odds of being diagnosed with high blood pressure by 37 per cent,  lung disease by 29 per cent, arthritis by 25 per cent and a heart condition by 24 per cent

AGREEABLENESS

Agreeable individuals value getting along with other people. They tend to be considerate, kind, generous, helpful, trusting and trustworthy, and willing to compromise.

A one unit increase in agreeableness decreased the odds of an arthritis diagnosis by 21 per cent.

Professor Joshua Jackson, told MailOnline previous studies have not linked the trait of agreeableness to health, so he would want to replicate these findings in future studies to be sure of the link.

One theory, however, is that the social connections well-fostered by agreeable people protect them against disease. 

He said: 'Agreeable individuals are warm, caring. They make deeper connections. Social connections are associated with good health, there’s lots of research on that. That could be the reason why agreeableness is protective. 

NEUROTICISM 

Neurotic people are sensitive and nervous, and often experience anger, anxiety, or depression.

Neurotic people who are constantly worrying are more likely to develop a disease to worry about in later life, the study found.

A one unit increase in neuroticism increased the odds of being diagnosed with a heart condition by 24 per cent, lung disease by 29 per cent, high blood pressure by 37 per cent, and arthritis by 25 per cent.

THE STUDY

As part of the study, researchers used data on 6,904 Americans, whose median age was 68, who had visited a doctor or clinic within the previous two years.

They had participated in the University of Michigan’s Health and Retirement Study.

In order to score their personality traits, participants were given a list of adjectives with a range of words from ‘outgoing’, ‘dominant’, ‘friendly’ and ‘sophisticated’.

They were asked to report how well each word described them, and based on their answers they were scored on a scale between one and four for each ‘Big Personality’ trait.

Four years later, they were contacted asked whether they had been diagnosed by a doctor with any serious illness from a given list.

Being more conscientious - hardworking, reliable and self- controlled - or more curious and open to experience could actually protect against diseases like stroke, arthritis (left), high blood pressure and diabetes (right)

The study found women were more extroverted, agreeable, conscientious, and neurotic than men.

Older people were less extroverted, less conscientious, less neurotic, and less open than younger adults.

Married individuals were more conscientious, open and emotionally stable than people who were not married.

Interestingly, personality traits did not predict the diagnosis of cancer, one of the leading causes of death worldwide.

It was not possible to infer from the data the increased risk of being diagnosed with a disease a person rated highly with any individual trait (scoring four on the scale) is than someone rated as a person rated lowly on that trait (scored one on the scale), the researcher said.

Professor Jackson, of Washington University in St Louis, U.S., told MailOnline: 'This study was important because it demonstrated that one’s personality predicts and is associated with important diseases. 

Researchers said being conscientious, open and extroverted meant people often ate healthily, took exercise, managed their stress and communicated well with physicians. One theory about why neurotic people suffer more disease is that their body releases more 'stress hormone' cortisol, which harms the immune system

'The development of those diseases are really due to the way that you behave, and think and see the world.

'The way that you approach the world, see the world, interact with the world, affects your health.'

When asked if it was possible for people to change their personality in order to protect themselves against disease, he said it would be better to study why certain characteristics of personality are protective.

He said: 'Other research has shown that personality is not set in stone, we do change it subtly.

'It’s possible, over the course of 20 years, to see naturally occurring change.

'Right now we don’t know how to change someone’s personality to change their health. But we can look at the reasons why people with certain characteristics have better health, and people without those characteristics could replicate those mechanisms.'

The study was published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.
