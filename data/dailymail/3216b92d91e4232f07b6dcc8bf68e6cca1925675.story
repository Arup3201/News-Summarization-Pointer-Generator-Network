Barack Obama said Monday that it may be time to review a Pentagon program that has placed billions of dollars worth of surplus military gear and equipment in the hands of local police forces since before he became president.

The U.S. Defense Department has been 
contributing to the militarization of local police forces since at least
 2007, handing over heavy armaments, battle helicopters and armored 
vehicles for use in urban policing scenarios.

'I think 
it's probably useful for us to review how the funding was done, how 
local law enforcement has used grant dollars,' Obama told reporters at the White House, 'to make sure that what 
they're purchasing is stuff that they actually need.'

'There is a 
big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and 
we don't want those lines blurred. That would be contrary to our 
tradition,' he said.

Last
 week's armed confrontations between police and protesters in Ferguson, 
Missouri, where an officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old, have 
ignited a national debate about the militarization of law enforcement 
agencies.

Barack Obama put his oar into the national debate over the militarization of local police forces on Monday, saying it may be time for Congress to take a close look at how the Pentagon is giving army gear to law-enforcement personnel

Obama predicted that 'there will be some bipartisan interest in 
re-examining some of those programs,' even while he offered a justification for their existence.

'After 
9/11,' he said, 'I think, understandably, a lot of folks saw local communities that
 were ill-equipped for a potential catastrophic terrorist attack.'

'And 
then people in Congress, and people of good will decided that we've got 
to make sure that they get proper equipment to deal with [it] ... And 
some of that's been useful.'

But data from the Law Enforcement Support Office of the U.S.
 Defense Logistics Agency show that the Pentagon transferred ownership of at least 
239,000 items to civilian law enforcement agencies between 2007 and 
April of this year.

While some of the Pentagon's gifts are as mundane as rubber gloves and 
x-ray machines, others include a fleet of $18 million combat helicopters and 
345 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs) worth between 
$412,000 and $1.08 million apiece.

MRAPs were put into service in the U.S. military to protect personnel from roadside bobs and other improvised explosive devices.

The Detroit Free Press first obtained the raw data from the Pentagon through a Freedom of Information Act request, and completed an analysis of equipment gifted to police forces in Michigan. 

In addition to 17 MRAPs, law enforcement there received 696 model M14 rifles, 32 12-gauge, 'riot-type shotguns' and nine grenade launchers since 2006, according to the paper.

But the larger picture shows hundreds of helicopters, including some sophisticated armored models, ending up in the control of local governments.

In 2011 the Pentagon gave Brevard County, Florida, a suburban coastal region that includes Cocoa Beach and Cape Canaveral, ownership of eight choppers valued at $18 million each.

Data released by the government don't identify the flying machines by name. But a defense analyst told MailOnline that the per-unit cost 'matches the basic profile of an attack helicopter.'

'There's really no civilian observation chopper on the market that costs that much,' he said.

Most of the helicopters described in the data from the Free Press are valued at less than $1 million each, and are identified as 'observation' craft.

Military weapons and armor have crossed over from Army bases to police barracks tens of thousands of times in the last seven years, including firearms and anti-ambush vehicles

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office operates a small fleet of just three choppers. There at 16 different incorporated towns and cities in the county, but the Pentagon hasn't provided information about which police forces operate those aircraft.

More than $45 million worth of rifles – some 89,000 in all, in three calibers – also left the federal government and landed in the trunks of police cruisers.

In three U.S. counties, authorities received 13 M59A 'field range' sniper rifles, worth $3,263 each.

Police in Covington County, Alabama; Kern County, California and Lee County, Florida were the lucky recipients of those firearms. The latter two are home to the cities of Bakersfield and Fort Myers, respectively.

The Defense Department has also donated 9,900 handguns, including more than 400 '.38 special' revolvers.

A total of 98 armored vehicles are also on the list – classified as wheeled 'combat / assault / tactical' rides.

Perhaps the strangest item migrating from a military base to a police barracks would look more at home in 'Good Morning, Vietnam' than in 'Full Metal Jacket.'

Two South Carolina counties got $4 million mobile radio broadcast stations designed to flood enemy territory with propaganda messages.

The 
'Special Operations Media System B' (SOMS-B) radio systems consist of 
radio and television broadcast stations and antennas mounted on humvees 
that tow their own generators. It's 21 tons of gear in all, according to the Department of the Army.

In
 Afghanistan, according to congressional hearing transcripts, the Army 
used SOMS-B systems to broadcast 10,000 watts of propaganda messages 
into villages near Bagram Airfield, interspersed with recordings of 
Afghan music, sports reports and local news flashes.

Not just in Ferguson: Police forces nationwide have requested and been given surplus military hardware to kit their officers out on the job

Necessary? Critics say even tiny towns are receiving battle gear

Now that the US Army has pulled out of Afghanistan, this MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) armored fighting vehicle could be the very same one seen on Missouri streets

The SOMS-B system can broadcast on any AM, FM, shortwave or television frequency, meaning that the U.S. military could interrupt or overwhelm any broadcast it chose to, replacing it with political messages designed to soften locals' objections and encourage the acceptance of political changes that favored the U.S. mission.

It's unclear what authorities in Darlington and Spartanburg Counties intend to use the gear for.

The Chicago Tribune reported in 1997, when the SOMS-B platform was first tested, that similar setups had instructed Iraqi soldiers on how to surrender to American troops.

They 'can be carried into an area on two C-130 cargo planes, set up and begin broadcasting in about three hours,' according to the Tribune, which called them part of a 'psyops' – psychological operations – approach to warfare.
