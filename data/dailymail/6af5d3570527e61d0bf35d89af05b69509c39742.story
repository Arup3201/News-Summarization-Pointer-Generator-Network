A six-year-old girl who was raped and murdered had been submerged in water prior to her violent death, an autopsy report has revealed.

Alanna Gallagher had been immersed in water for a prolonged period before her body was found in Texas in July, according to a coroner's report completed last month.

It is unclear whether the little girl was put in the water alive or dead - or whether it was an attempt to wash away evidence. Her body, hair and clothing were wet when she was found and the surfaces of her hands and feet revealed she had been in the water for some time.

Brutal death: Alanna's official cause of death has been determined to be asphyxiation from plastic shopping bags placed over her head. She was also immersed in water, a recent autopsy report has revealed

Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon told the Star-Telegram on Wednesday: 'I don’t know that we’ll ever have definitive answers to the questions you pose.

'All of the theories you list are consistent with avenues we investigated over the summer.'

Tyler Holder, 17, is believed to have acted alone when he abducted, raped and smothered 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher in July

A Texas coroner determined that Alanna, who was found dead under a tarp in Saginaw, Fort Worth on July 1, was raped and then smothered with plastic bags. 

Police believe 17-year-old Tyler
Holder acted alone when he abducted the child, sexually assaulted and killed her before dumping her body.

Holder was shot in the throat on July 23 when he 
opened fire on police officers as they tried to arrest him, wounding one of them in the groin.

The
teenage suspect had survived his injuries and now faces charges of 
capital murder and attempted capital murder in connection to the 
shooting of a police officer. Holder remains in jail on $1million bail.

According
to a report recently released by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's 
Office, Alanna's official cause of death determined to be was 
asphyxiation from the four plastic shopping bags wrapped around her 
head.

New documents made public in the case and cited by Dallas Morning News
show that police believe Holder acted alone, but may have used his 
mother's car to abduct the child and then dispose of her body.

The documents also state that Holder bought a new cell phone two days after Alanna's murder.

The
teen gave his old phone to a friend, who told police after Holder’s 
arrest July 23 that he had discovered a YouTube search for 'Good kid 
porn websites' on the device, as well as images of male genitals and 
pictures of the suspect dressed as a woman.

Anti-social: Holder, who has been described as a trouble-maker, lived opposite Alanna in Saginaw. A street view picture of his home shows two people making obscene gestures at the Google camera

The 17-year-old accused of brutally 
raping and murdering his six-year-old neighbor left a note for his mother 
that read: 'I love you, I'm sorry,' according to FBI documents.

Duct
tape, used condoms and blood-stained toilet paper were also listed as 
items found by officers when they searched Tyler Holder's home.

However, the first item listed on a receipt of 153 items seized by the FBI, according to KHOU, was a 'sealed letter addressed to Mom with 'I 
love you, I'm sorry', and a crumpled up piece of paper with the
words 'Mom I' on it.

Holder's
neighbors had described him as a trouble maker who had been involved in
'criminal mischief', the arrest warrant showed.

Classmates
have also described the 17-year-old as 'socially awkward' and in a 
Google picture of the suspect's home, two obscured people can be seen 
making obscene hand gestures at the Google car camera. It has not been 
confirmed if Holder was in the picture.

According
to the warrant, Alanna was sexually assaulted and suffocated, before 
her wrists and ankles were bound with red duct tape, and her body was 
dumped in a tarp less than a mile from her home July 1.

When investigators later searched Holder's home, they discovered a
purple Timex watch with pink and green flowers on it, which matched the description of the timepiece Alanna's parents had given her so the girl would know when to come home while playing outside.

Girls' necklaces 
and jewelry, latex gloves, computers, digital 
cameras and a journal were also seized.

Officers were able to trace a roll of toilet paper found with Alanna's body to Costco, which Holder's mother was a member of.

Originally, Saginaw Police had said 
they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was 
under suspicion almost immediately, according to 8 News.

Within
hours of Alanna’s body being found, officers reported seeing Tyler 
Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says.

Residents
informed police Holder had told them it was Alanna’s body that had
been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of 
the victim.

The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching.

Holder
was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of
Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to 
apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic.

The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,'

Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. But
video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling 
Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had 
said.

When they analyzed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position.

During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men. On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were later notified that it matched evidence found on Alanna's body.

Four days later, officers arrived at 
Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbors heard them pounding on the 
door shortly before multiple shots rang out.

Charles Lodatto, an officer who was 
wounded during the confrontation, was shot in the groin and the bullet 
hit an artery and broke into pieces.

The
probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest offered gruesome details about the suffering inflicted upon 
Alanna, who went missing on July 1.

Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy found her body

The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped.

Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen 
Whiddon bound and wrapped in a 
gray tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home 
later in the day of her disappearance.

Genetic
evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder 
voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say.

His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna’s body in the tarp.

Four Walmart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck. Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape.

Police
later found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in 
rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two 
doors from where Alanna lived with her family.

Alanna lived with her siblings, their 
parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles McDaniel, who
was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents.

Police
have said that the Gallaghers and McDaniel were home while Alanna 
played outside alone. They are not sure when she was abducted from the 
neighborhood.
