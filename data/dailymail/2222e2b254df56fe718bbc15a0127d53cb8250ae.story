Hiram Lawrence was shot in the head when an six gunmen targeted a group filming a rap video in Oakland, California on November 28.

Tragic: Hiram Lawrence has been declared brain dead after he was shot during a shoot out on November 28. His family will turn off his life support on Friday

Innocent: Hiram, whose second birthday is just three weeks away, was shot in his father's arms in a liquor store car park in Oakland, California on November 28

His parents made a public plea begging doctors to give their son more time as they searched for a second opinion.

But the family's pediatrician  confirmed the diagnosis on Thursday.

'The family agreed with [the outcome], accepted it,' said Oakland attorney Ivan Golde. 'They are overwhelmed but the hospital has been telling them this since the [child] came in.'

Hospital spokeswoman Erin Goldsmith has refused to comment on the case, citing patient confidentiality.

Grieving: Kiana Matthews, a relative of Hiram, outside the city's Children's Hospital. Relatives sought a second opinion after doctors said he was brain dead

Struggle: Norman Bobino, Hiram's uncle, wipes away tears outside the hospital. The family's pediatrician confirmed the diagnosis on Thursday

It comes in sad contrast to the plan the family announced last week.

'Unfortunately, the family and the 
attending physicians have come to a crossroads, and we're unable to 
agree on a continuum of care for baby Hiram; as a result the family is 
seeking support from patients' rights advocates/attorneys,' according to
the statement released on December 2. '

We appreciate [what] the medical team 
at Children's Hospital is doing, but we want to make sure baby Hiram 
receives every opportunity to survive this vicious ordeal.'

The youngster was shot while in his father's arms in a liquor store car park.

Witnesses
say 20-30 people had gathered at in the city's West Oakland 
neighbourhood to film a rap music video at around 6pm when the suspects 
opened fire with automatic weapons.

Three from the targeted group are then thought to have fired back.

Investigators
found dozens of bullet casings near a parking lot close to the Nimitz 
Freeway and the U.S. Post Office, which suggested at least six gunmen 
were involved.

Police reported finding blood on the 
street and later established the incident started when dozens of people 
gathered in a liquor store parking lot, drinking and shooting a music 
video just after dark.

Peppered: The scene in Oakland, California was littered with shell casings. Police believe the number suggests six shooters may have been involved

Hiram had been driven to the city's 
Children's Hospital by his father, who had been shot in the hand.

Seven others were injured, and two people, a 16-year-old boy and a 24-year-old woman, remain hospitalised in critical but stable condition.

A
surveillance camera mounted on the liquor store captured the entire 
incident, which will help police identify suspects and vehicles.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection with the shooting, but have interviewed and detained five people on unrelated charges.

The investigation is ongoing.
