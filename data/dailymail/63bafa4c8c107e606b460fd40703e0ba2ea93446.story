For some managers it's an absolute Godsend - a chance to sign much-needed reinforcements and salvage an ailing season before it's too late.

And in the last five campaigns it's been Newcastle United who are the most likely to get out the chequebook in the January transfer window.

Forty-four per cent of the Tyneside club's transfer activity during that time has come in the first month of the year - the highest percentage in the Premier League.

Hatem Ben Arfa is one of the many January signings made by Newcastle United in the last five years

Newcastle also acquired Mathieu Debuchy - one of six signings made in January 2013

The window in January 2010 saw them bring in Danny Simpson, Wayne Routledge, Mike Williamson and Leon Best. Twelve months later they added Hatem Ben Arfa to their squad.

Newcastle splashed out £9million on Papiss Cisse to boost their attack in January 2012 and signed six players - Mathieu Debuchy, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Yoan Gouffran, Massadio Haidara, Moussa Sissoko and Kevin Mbabu - in 2013.

The general trend in January, understandably, sees clubs struggling at the bottom end of the table reaching deep into their pockets while those challenging at the top keep their squad settled.

West Ham signed Demba Ba from Hoffenheim in January 2011 and are second-most likely to buy in winter

QPR bought Loic Remy from Marseille for £8m in the January transfer window in 2013

In the past five seasons, West Ham have done 37 per cent of their transfer business in January, while Queens Park Rangers have completed 36 per cent.

Hull have done 31 per cent during the winter window, while Leicester, Crystal Palace and Southampton all stand at 29 per cent.

The research by the Liverpool Echo comes as clubs everywhere begin the search for bargains that will improve their chances of success in the second-half of the season. 

David Moyes brought in Juan Mata 12 months ago in a bid to save Manchester United's season

The most expensive January transfer was Fernando Torres's £50m switch from Liverpool to Chelsea in 2011

Their statistics show West Brom are the least likely to do their transfer business in January at just 12 per cent, though that might be about to change if Tony Pulis shakes up his squad. 

Manchester City (15 per cent), Man United (20), Liverpool (20), Tottenham (21) and Arsenal (21) are keen to make most additions to their squad in the summer window.

Memorable January transfer window acquisitions include Fernando Torres swapping Liverpool for Chelsea in a £50m deal in 2011 and Luis Suarez moving from Ajax to Liverpool for £22.5m in the same year.
