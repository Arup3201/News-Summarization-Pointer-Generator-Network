Mario Balotelli is not a 'massive scorer' like Luis Suarez and must 'become a more responsible adult' if he is to succeed at Liverpool, believes West Ham United boss Sam Allardyce.

Liverpool travel to Upton Park on Saturday to face the Hammers and Allardyce thinks Brendan Rodgers' acquisition of Balotelli could be a shrewd and calculated gamble if the striker reaches double figures this season.

Writing in his column in the Evening Standard, Allardyce said: 'He (Balotelli) showed in the Champions League this week that he can score from a half-chance and if he has managed to improve his temperament on and off the field and become a more responsible adult, then I think he could be a big player for Liverpool.

'He’s not a Luis Suarez, but if he can finish the season in double figures, then he will have been a success.'

Allardyce is wary of the threat posed by Balotelli and Liverpool, although he thinks the loss of Suarez will affect their potency in front of goal.

Balotelli did score his first goal for the Reds in the Champions League against Ludogorets on Tuesday, however.

But the West Ham boss continued: 'Mario and others in that Liverpool squad are going to have to improve their scoring ratio to compensate for the departure of Suarez.

'The difference with us is that although we also have to improve our goals total, we haven’t just lost a massive scorer - we haven’t had one yet.
