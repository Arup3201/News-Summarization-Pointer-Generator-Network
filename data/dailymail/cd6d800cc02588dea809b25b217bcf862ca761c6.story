Brad Dillon, 26, was gunned down on a busy Leichhardt street on Monday evening

The man who was tragically shot and killed in an inner-west suburb of Sydney on Monday night has been identified as a 26-year-old husband with two young children.

Brad Dillon was gunned down in a very public execution just before 6pm, a murder which was witnessed by many locals in Leichhardt.

He was shot in the chest five times outside local shopping centre MarketPlace, and Nine News reported that two people at the scene attempted to give the man CPR - but he could not be saved.

Residents on Lords Road told Daily Mail Australia they heard the gunshots from inside their houses, with one woman saying she had been at the shops just minutes before the shooting took place.

Mr Dillon is survived by his wife and two young kids, and a friend - who did not wish to be named - told Daily Mail Australia there was no other way to describe him but as an all round good guy.

'He was a great bloke, a really great bloke', they said.

'And in more recent times he really became a family guy.'

Mr Dillon was an exceptional football player who was part of the Balmain Tigers junior representative team when he was younger

The father of two was an excellent football player, and played at a very high level for his local footy team the North Ryde Hawks for many years.

He was also formerly part of the junior representative team for the Balmain Tigers, with some of his teammates now high profile players in the NRL.

Police are still searching for two men who were seeing fleeing the scene following the shooting. They escaped up nearby George Street on foot.

One was said to be wearing a green rugby shirt with the number seven printed on the back, while the other was seen in a blue hat and shirt and black gloves.

Officers are said to be looking in to whether some possible involvement in low-level drug dealing could have been a motive for the shooting.

'Itâ€™s early stages of the investigation but certainly we are looking at all lines of inquiry,' Acting Superintendent Winston Pisani told Nine News.
