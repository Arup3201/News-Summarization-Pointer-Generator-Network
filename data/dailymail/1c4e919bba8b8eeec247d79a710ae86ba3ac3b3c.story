A mother-of-four has told of how a state-appointed drugs counsellor used her for sex and attempted to abort her unborn child with his bare hands when she was eight months pregnant.

Johanna Bernal, 35, from New York, suffered from schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction in the wake of an abusive relationship with the father of her three oldest children. 

Counsellor George Alejandro, 61, is being accused of taking advantage of his vulnerable patient for four years, during which time she was kept in 'a drugged state', The New York Post reports.

Accusations: Johanna Bernal, 35, was used for sex by her 61-year-old drugs counsellor who then tried to abort their baby when she was eight months pregnant by 'pouncing on her' in a hotel room, using his hands according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court

Ms Bernal, originally from Colombia, was assigned to Alejandro after her mother had turned to the city of New York for help in 2003.

Alejandro was working for Vida Family Services, a taxpayer-funded agency, as a drug counsellor, but instead of treating Ms Bernal, he took her to a hotel to have sex, a lawsuit alleges.

Shortly afterwards Ms Bernal's mother Alicia Alvarez alleges she caught Alejandro massaging her daughter in her bedroom in the family home in Queens.

Ms Bernal fell pregnant with Alejandro, and when she was eight months gone, the counsellor invited her to a hotel room.

There he 'pounced on her, using four fingers to [attempt to] abort the baby. He wanted to rip the baby out,' Ms Alvarez told The New York Post.

Ms Bernal's mother was referred to taxpayer-funded Vida Family Services in 2003, where Ms Bernal was assigned to Alejandro who allegedly went on to use her for sex

Ms Bernal was taken to hospital and the baby's life could be saved, and although her mother wanted to go to the police, she told The New York Post Alejandro threatened to kill the family if she did.

Ms Bernal, now mother to Alejandro's child, and her mother Ms Alvarez, filed a $20million lawsuit  in Manhattan federal court against the city of New York and the Administration for Children’s Services which had referred Ms Bernal to Alejandro's agency.

'My family has suffered a lot at the hands of this man. I live in fear,Ms Bernal told the Post. 

Alejandro did not have a state certificate as a certified addiction and substance-abuse counselor until 2005.

He refutes that he had a sexual relationship with Ms Bernal and denies fatherhood of the child. 

The Administration for Children’s Services is reviewing the matter.
