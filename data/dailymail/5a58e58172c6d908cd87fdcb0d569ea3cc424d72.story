I scream, you scream, we all scream for… crocodile ice cream – or at least in the Philippines they do.

A restaurant in Davao City has come up with the unusually flavoured frozen dessert after the owners were offered some eggs from the crocodile park next door, where the animals are raised for their meat and skin.

But animal lovers need not to worry, as the ice cream is not made with crocodile meat but just with eggs that did not hatch or are surplus, the owners of the Sweet Spot eatery said.

Unusual treat: The ice cream by Sweet Spot eatery in Davao City in the Philippines is made with crocodile eggs

Sweet Spot's artisan ice cream uses crocodile eggs instead of hen eggs together with the more usual ingredients of milk, cream, sugar and flavourings.

The owners of Sweet Spot, Dino and Bianca Ramos, received some crocodile eggs from Dino's uncle, the owner of the nearby Davao Crocodile Park.

Not knowing what to do with them, Dino decided to try to make ice cream and found themselves with a delicious treat on their hands.

Dino said: ‘Of course it is regular ice cream that doesn't taste of croc meat. It's only the eggs we use. But they do make delicious ice cream.

'Because crocs are an endangered species, we only get the eggs that do not hatch or are surplus.’

According to Sweet Spot, crocodile eggs are 80 per cent yolk and much more nutritious than chicken's eggs, making it a healthier choice for their ice cream.

Unusually flavoured ice creams are not so unusual after all.

Ice Cream Parlour, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, sells fish and chips ice cream, made using bits of real battered cod, deep-fried potatoes and mushy peas.

And London ice cream shop The Icecreamists caused a stir when they started selling breast milk ice cream under the name of Baby Gaga.

But probably Japan is king when it comes to weird ice cream flavours: raw horse meat, cow tongue and octopus are just some of the strange tastes available in the country.
